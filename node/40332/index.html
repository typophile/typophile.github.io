  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcXUrNSvjhU">YouTube video</a> of a presentation at Google by Håkon Lie and Michael Day has Lie declaring that InDesign users, particularly at newspapers, will soon be so passé  they will be more comparable to the old guys who moved “lead” type.</p>
<p>The context is the ability of Prince, a software application, to output a “typeset” PDF from HTML+CSS. (Lie was coauthor of the original CSS spec.) While that claimed capacity was covered in an <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/boom" title="Printing a book under CSS">article</a> I read, then and now my response is “<em>I’ll</em> be the judge of that.” The presenters’ insistence that HTML-CSS-Prince handles “most” requirements (more than 80%) will, I suspect, be antithetical to the real typographers who read this forum. I think we spend rather a lot of time on that other 20%.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uh, yepp. We spend way too much time on that 20% CSS doesn&rsquo;t handle particularly well. Sorting out formatting problems in webpages designed with CSS has long been a major time waster for me. It&rsquo;s just plain deadline-threatening. CSS&rsquo;s failings are typical of the developmental bungling the W3C are reknown for. The fact I&rsquo;d rather have a new biro should tell you everything. Also try: eating glass.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m equally critical of the &lsquo;standards&rsquo; pushed by MS and Adobe. Their software blows goats. What WC3 delivers is seldom any better.

<p>I think it was just to show off a particular technology&hellip;one that would (in theory) reduce the workload of a publisher that needs to accommodate multiple mediums. Instead of typesetting it for print, then formatting it for the web, you&rsquo;d do it once, for both mediums, via HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s definitely more of a &lsquo;in theory&rsquo; thing right now, but I can definitely see hos there is some appeal to this down the road for high volume publishers (such as the newspaper they used in the example in the beginning).</p>

<p>Back in the day, typesetting was done by typesetters, design by designers. The Mac changed all that, now most designers I know do their own typesetting (for better or worse).

<p>CSS isn&rsquo;t really more complicated than understanding proper styles in XPress or Indesign.</p>

<p>True, but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily influence the dominance of production tools and workflows. Quark Xpress managed to grab most of the page layout market for a long time while supporting somewhat <em>less</em> than 80% of typographic sophistication; indeed, so much less that Dean Allen used to call it anti-typographic.</p>

<p>XHTML and CSS is XML, so we shouldn&rsquo;t be too far off from having a design program that can automatically spit it out properly encoded text. No programming required.</p>
<p>The issue is having a comprehensive enough CSS specification that covers more than the 80% of what we&rsquo;re talking about. IF, and it&rsquo;s a big if, we can get the specification to reach at least the level of sophistication of say, Pagemaker, that&rsquo;s a lot of design that can be accomplished.</p>

<p>I have had more-than-satisfactory results with a workflow of valid HTML → MS Word → InDesign → tagged PDF. I start with and end up with published, accessible formats, and one of the intermediate formats lets me twiddle with typography and page layout to my heart’s content. (It bothers me that InDesign cannot simply inhale a valid [X]HTML file directly.)</p>
<p>I feel I am reasonably informed on the topic and I am pretty sure that even Prince would not do what I want. Typesetting a single page that varies its number of columns is punishingly difficult in CSS yet readily achieved in InDesign, for example. Then there are the issues of ligature substitution, swash characters, and <em>real</em> H&amp;J. (Hyphenation is rather glossed over in the video; it’s viewed as being present or absent. I would like to know how I <em>prevent</em> a word from being hyphenated in Prince, for example.)</p>
<p>Even if John is right, the baseline has been raised. For Prince to achieve 80% of InDesign is a much taller order than PageMaker’s achieving 80% of whatever came before it. (And if that was 80% of the crapola CompuGraphic photosetters I worked on, well, how hard was that?)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Am I wrong, or are there not plenty of newspapers and magazines still using their own custom developed page layout systems designed to coordinate out put with invoicing systems for ad space? Something Quark and Indesign didn&rsquo;t do before, and something I don&rsquo;t quite see CSS handling. The applications I know best are for making signs, and they can track inventory, billable hours, etc. and spit out an invoice when you are done. I imagine a newspaper publisher would expect nothing less. Does CSS do that and if it does, is it still a cascading style sheet?</p>

(82.5% is better. ;o) These rules almost always make it seem as though it&rsquo;s the 20% that you <em>really</em> want.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The CCI system used at the Seattle Times is exactly such a system. It was originally designed to aid the layout of time-intensive, text and ad heavy publications like phone books. It was and is not a typographically advanced system, no ligatures I&rsquo;m afraid. It handles the bulk of the design work though, since ads constitute the bulk of a paper.</p>
<p>For graphically intense pages without ads, like our Entertainment and Arts Page 1, we use InDesign and Illustrator because we need more control over that final 17.5%</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t even begin to talk about classified advertising, because my head will explode.</p>
<p>Will CSS handle this? Perhaps a sophisticated enough CSS spec could handle the layout of a dimestore novel respectably, but something as complex as a multi-page newspaper needs to not only be well specified, but also brutally error-free and as steady as a rock.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;For instance, although not a design program, Microsoft Word now uses XML.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As does InDesign, actually.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;d be nice to see a company like Adobe embrace a product like this and incorporate it into their own DTP apps.</p>
<p>However, knowing MS and Adobe, they don&rsquo;t really like those open standards and prefer to keep to themselves. ;o)</p>
<p>(To be fair, I think Adobe has been a bit better in this regard than MS has)</p>
<p>&ldquo;No programming required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, for the record, CSS as it is now isn&rsquo;t really programming. It&rsquo;s just learning a bit of syntax. Really no different than learning prepress terms, or how to bind a book, etc. Just another publishing medium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel I am reasonably informed on the topic and I am pretty sure that even Prince would not do what I want. Typesetting a single page that varies its number of columns is punishingly difficult in CSS yet readily achieved in InDesign, for example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe, have you used Prince yet? I haven&rsquo;t, but if you do, I&rsquo;d love your opinion. I agree that for a web browser, using CSS for varying columns is a huge PITA at the moment. Prince, however, seems to actually support CSS-3 fully, which DOES allow for columnar layouts. One example: <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/CSS3_Columns">http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/CSS3_Columns</a></p>
<p>I agree, this is not a replacement for InDesign now. I am thrilled by the potential it has down the road, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know best are for making signs, and they can track inventory, billable hours, etc. and spit out an invoice when you are done. I imagine a newspaper publisher would expect nothing less. Does CSS do that and if it does, is it still a cascading style sheet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have no answer for that (though would love to hear one). But, to add to the topic, it seems as if most successful papers are moving a lot of their ad revenue towards their online existence as advertiser depend less and less on the print medium for advertising. So this may very well become a nice addition to, rather than replacement of, current systems. It&rsquo;s been a decade since I&rsquo;ve worked in a paper, though (which, at the time, was MS Word, cut and pasted into XPress [and then printed, cut, and waxed onto the keylines&hellip;those were the days&hellip;] and then cut and pasted into a primitive HTML editor where we published each article manually onto a static HTML site.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which we all know web design/xhtml/css to NOT be. (See Exhibit A, Internet Explorer, any version.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, Prince isn&rsquo;t a web browser. It&rsquo;s a HTML/XML to PDF renderer. The appeal is that it does support a much fuller set of the CSS spec (especially for print) than any current web browser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, this is using proper CSS, but XML/SGML + stylesheets have been used for print for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excellent point. Doesn&rsquo;t Framemaker also use SGML or a subset thereof?</p>
<p>I think the idea, though, is that everyone touches HTML/XML these days, if not a fuller SGML subset. So this product probably hits a few more of the pragmatic buzzwords out there.</p>

Last time I used Framemaker (admittedly, a few years ago) it worked quite well with XML (although it had to translate it into its own native markup). The most impressive thing about Framemaker was its very powerful stylesheet system to which nothing I&rsquo;ve seen comes close.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Google is barking up an interesting tree, but it&rsquo;s still the wrong one. What I would much rather see is a tool like InDesign that can actually output usable HTML/CSS! Why use CSS for typesetting? Back Asswards.</p>
<p>Outputting a typeset PDF deserves a (one handed golf clap) applause. But getting a decent layout application that works flawlessly is a whole other thing. Writing CSS still requires a developer to sit down and write code. We&rsquo;ve gone miles beyond hand-writing Post Script, but we&rsquo;re not there close with HTML/CSS editors. We&rsquo;re 10 years out from the time the original WYSIWYG editors came out (NetObjects, GoLive) and still no serious web developers worth their salt use (or admit to using) WYSIWYG tools because they introduce too much error and require hand-coding. (Modern browser suckage is as much to blame as the people behind Dreamweaver.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned some basic CSS because I had to for a client (to post some of their stuff on a website I did not design in the first place), not because I wanted to.  ;-)  And as much as I think Dreamweaver is terrifically useful for sketching-out things like tables that can be intricate (WYSIWYG is rather passé, as Joe has noted, although it does have its moments), I find that I still do most of my coding by hand.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>Technologies usually don&rsquo;t go away completely, but their use tends to become more specialized as they are replaced. The paperless office is actually a good example. Sure we still use printers, and there is still paper around the office, but they are used very differently. Paper now tends to be very temporary. It is almost always a copy of something that already exists in digital form. It may be a handout for a meeting, or a note to be thrown away, but it&rsquo;s rare that people have binders and filing cabinets full of things they intend to keep. More often for that type of thing you hear &ldquo;can you send me a digital copy?&rdquo;. What&rsquo;s more, that transition is far from over. Offices are still populated by &ldquo;digital immigrants&rdquo;. The new generation of natives use the technologies very differently, and they certainly aren&rsquo;t printing out everything they read like the old folks.</p>
<p>Another good example of this would be handwriting itself. Whereas handwriting used to be used for everything, it was replaced in large part by printing. It was replaced further by typewriters and morse code. Computers, personal printers and email further relegated it to a niche purpose. Texting and t9 have even replaced it for notes passed under the desk in junior high school. Now it&rsquo;s rare that we use handwriting to communicate with anyone but ourselves, rarely over distances, and almost never archivally. Sometimes it serves a nostalgic or ceremonial purpose, like for handwritten thank you notes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the same thing happens with words as they are replaced by new ones: the old words take on more specialized meanings.</p>
<p>As for a date where printing will be gone from the face of the earth: probably never. As for a date where it started to fade, just look at the sales charts for paper newspapers, paperback books and annual report design, to name a few. Moving forward the act of stamping ink on paper will likely fill a niche purpose, at best for something useful or artistic, at worst for nostalgia alone. Unfortunately there will be typographic quality lost in the translation (ie that last 20%), especially at first.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Christian, I think there&rsquo;s no doubt that the mix is changing, with more going digital. How far it will go to my thinking depends partly on how good screens get. Have you seen the new Amazon &lsquo;Kindle&rsquo; screen with text on it?  I haven&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;m wondering if it really is &lsquo;digital paper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We print things out or buy print on paper when we want to read anything extended. And the preference for readers, probably based on physiology and psychology of reading is for small type&ndash;12 pt and under. That means to my thinking that screens won&rsquo;t substitute for paper until there are high resolution screens&ndash;at least 300 dpi,and maybe up to 1200. And then, I don&rsquo;t know. As Yogi Berra said, prediction is really hard, especially when it comes to the future :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As to the original post, I fail to see the scandal. Forget all the rhetorics (20% vs 80%, death of InDesign), just stick to what he actually presented.*
The presentation makes it clear that Mr Lie is not a typographer, see his selection of &lsquo;good&rsquo; typefaces or the fact that he does not seem much interested in OpenType except for the fancier features. I do not even care since in the more fundamental issues he is pretty right: The HTML+CSS model is (or allows to be) quite strict in separating two independent domains which are, first, structured data, and second, (graphic or typographic) representation of these.</p>
<p>I think that in the long run, typographers will need to think of design in a more structured and abstract way. Designing nice books or brochures manually and individually by placing frames on a virtual page and filling these with given texts or images, is one thing. It is another thing to &lsquo;design&rsquo; design rules &ndash; the actual design results from (automatically) merging data and design rules. This is nothing to be afraid of, it can help make the design process more efficient. And this does not necessarily result in a loss of quality: What did the most traditional book designers do? Define the design rules. See the beautiful sketches by Jan Tschichold or Max Caflisch.
With this in mind, I consider ther HTML+CSS approach as pretty interesting. Another example is <a href="http://www.docscape.de" target="_blank">DocScape</a> (cannot find an English version). This system allows to program very complex design rules, and one command will merge these with texts and images from any database and generate a PDF of an entire catalog or book. Its developers claim that this is much different from scripting layouts in InDesign or XPress in that these fill fixed template pages or frames with content while in their system the layout by default is supposed to be programmed such that it can deal with texts and images of various length or size, e.g. using two columns instead of three.
&lsquo;Defining design&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;designing&rsquo; requires that designers or typographers are able to think of design abstractly.** And to make designers (myself included) feel comfortable with this it needs appropriate visually oriented tools. This is a particularly interesting question for which I have not seen solution. How would such a tool represent a layout, and allow designing it, if there is no &lsquo;content&rsquo; yet? Would it be possible to create such a layout visually nevertheless &ndash; and also <em>show</em> which parts of the layout are fixed and which parts remain variable? In short, how to represent virtual representation of data?
Nobody seems to have made an attempted to address this. Current solutions either force designers to fix text and image snippets on a digital page (PageMaker, XPress, InDesign), or require developers rather than designers (like LiveCycle, can anybody explain this to me in an afternoon?). There is nothing inbetween.</p>
<p>*  I think it was Mr Lie who made an interesting remark in the presentation: The actual typographic representation, which also includes things like hyphenation or optical margin alignment, is not up to CSS itself but to the browser or PDF generator.
**  For this reason, web designers and developers may easier adapt than print designers. Also I am not surprised that all these technologies, PrinceXML, but also AIR and WPF emerged from the web &amp; UI design rather than the print world. My impression is that currently there are pretty exciting things under way, including the above-mentioned technologies. Many of these have the potential to change the way we think of design: By allowing to address document (or print) design, web design, UI design in the same &lsquo;language&rsquo; they may help overcome the strict distinction of these three &ndash; they have more in common than previous design tools (special tools for each of them) suggested. The <em>real</em> distinction is between data and their representation. The same data can be represented in a book or on the screen, or these data may be opend up for manipulation, then the form of representation turns out to be a UI.)</p>
<p>As an aside, it is with more or less automatic design in mind that I think that fonts need to be spaced and kerned well enough that no or very little intervention by the typographer is required. And OpenType helps a lot with this.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Why use CSS for typesetting? Back Asswards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not at all. That&rsquo;s the very point of CSS. No different than style sheets in your DTP apps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen. How much professional typography experience do these gentlemen actually have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How much typographical experience do 90% of inDesign users have? ;o)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don’t think it has much to do with the medium. InDesign will go away when a proper typesetting tool replaces it. CSS is not it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CSS isn&rsquo;t a typesetting tool in and of itself. It&rsquo;s style markup language. Consider it like printers marks on the margins of a proof. Given that a lot of content is now being natively stored in XHTML and XML and the like, CSS seems like a perfectly logical extension. Now, whether or not Prince is &lsquo;the tool&rsquo; is certainly debatable, but I certainly see CSS as the future. Rather than XPress styles, InDesign styles, Word Styles, we&rsquo;d have one standard: CSS. If anything, and if the moons align, we might see InDesign eventually just use CSS natively within the application.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m a bit bemused by folks putting down Adobe-promoted standards relating to typography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with [insert big software corporation] promoted standards. It&rsquo;s when they are also solely owned by said entity that some of us tend to start rooting for the open standard instead.</p>
<p>And yea, I can&rsquo;t think of any Type-centric standards that Adobe has created that have been anything BUT a boon to the industry. I, personally, just have qualms about the Adobe vs. Microsoft issues as we go forward in trying to agree on standardization of content storage in general. If you&rsquo;re in a business where part of your requirements is to pump content out to the public at-large, then open HTML begins looking like the best solution. As it is now, one-click exporting from print documents into an easy to publish HTML format is still a bit of a dream for most DTP apps (though, admittedly, a big part of that is simply lack of application user training/knowledge).</p>
<p>As for calling these gentlemen out for a lack of type knowledge, I think that&rsquo;s valid&hellip;they are clearly more technology orientated and seem to be focused on a lot of university and scientific documentation (which is the origins of the web). But I don&rsquo;t think that invalidated their vision&hellip;if anything, it should be a call to arms to help them improve the product based on the needs of the professional typesetter/designer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still lingering or malingering does go on. Vinyl sales are up in a big way&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is maybe for an entirely different thread, but I find that point very interesting. Why is that? Clearly, part of that is the fact that it&rsquo;s a tangible item. Perhaps that&rsquo;s the appeal of Prince for some? It turns the intangible screen of HTML into a tangible book?</p>

<p>Thanks I didn&rsquo;t know that. I know Ray Larabie&rsquo;s fonts rather well. His free products have no serious problems. But surely there&rsquo;s a taste issue here. Ray&rsquo;s old Larabiefonts catalog is permanently &ldquo;set&rdquo; in the late 1990&rsquo;s/2000 era geist. Dieter Steffmann&rsquo;s blackletters I love but have never seen under the hood, and again there is a style issue.</p>
<p>Also, by &ldquo;popular angle&rdquo; I was thinking of Manfred Klein&rsquo;s mysterious output, confusing him with Steffmann for a moment.</p>
<p>@Thomas: <em>I’m a bit bemused by folks putting down Adobe-promoted standards relating to typography. I take it PostScript, Type 1 and now OpenType have not solved real problems and you didn’t like them?</em></p>
<p>I like what Adobe has given us and embrace it whole-heartedly. OpenType allows me to realize some fantastic creative ideas.</p>
<p>W3C&rsquo;s concept of typography and typesetting I find compromised. Its lack of versatility and precision is offputting.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@James: No offense intended to either you or Ray, but I might disagree with you on the quality of his fonts as well. I guess it depends on what you mean by &ldquo;no serious problems.&rdquo; For my own needs and how I evaluate fonts, &gt;95% of the time I&rsquo;m holding it to a pretty high standard, and price is only a secondary consideration for me.</p>
<p>I also assume that Ray is making a tradeoff between the quality of his fonts and the quantity/variety they produce (or the time he puts in per font, if you want to look at it that way).</p>
<p>Type designers in general are free to choose something other than the extreme &ldquo;quality&rdquo; end of that spectrum. Personally, I&rsquo;m more interested in typeface quality than quantity, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to see more of in the world as a whole.</p>
<p>This is all a bit of a diversion from the main topic. i think that the general idea that more and more content is going to be primarily Web based is true. The video in question sensationalizes it a bit, and there are questions about the speed of content migration to the Web. But the general idea is indisputable. I don&rsquo;t think that means either print or InDesign will go away any time soon, though.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thomas, no offense taken. I only meant no serious technical problems in Larabiefonts. Aesthetics and typeface design is of course another matter.
I would love to see Ray make fewer fonts of more artful design, but what Ray does is what Ray does (Ray is as Ray does) and it isn&rsquo;t really my job to decide major content issues for him. I&rsquo;m more a tweaker of his work and a coach, and a partner he bounces ideas off. He does the same for me.</p>
<p><em>I also assume that Ray is making a tradeoff between the quality of his fonts and the quantity/variety they produce (or the time he puts in per font, if you want to look at it that way).</em></p>
<p>There is a tradeoff in the amount of time put into each font in order to maintain the level of quantity Ray turns out. But again it&rsquo;s a matter of what Ray does being what Ray does. It&rsquo;s a question of momentum and keeping the momentum going. He needs to because that&rsquo;s his nature. It has everything to do with continuous creative activity and very little to do with compromising quality in any sense.</p>
<p><em>The video in question sensationalizes it a bit&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what I was getting at with, &ldquo;hedging for a poular angle&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not over until the obese lady sings.</p>

<p>THAT&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m waiting for. An ideal program would be a combination of Dreamweaver and InDesign, able to organize and simplify stylesheets for complex typography ALA InDesign, but output well-specified valid XHTML + CSS.</p>

<p>Alas, InDesign supporting valid XHTML and CSS won&rsquo;t fix the issues with a particular browser.</p>
<p>The reason css isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;precise&rsquo; is that it&rsquo;d not designed to be. HTML + CSS is how one typically &lsquo;suggests&rsquo; a visual presentation to the end user. It doesn&rsquo;t dictate it.</p>
<p>The appeal of an app like Prince or a CSS-enabled InDesign is that it would allow you to dictate a layout for that one particular medium&hellip;in this case, a PDF. You&rsquo;d still have valid CSS and HTML that may or may not render exactly as you want in any one particular web browser, but at least you&rsquo;d have the full control over the PDF you are creating. The valid and portable and semantic HTML+CSS is then just a bonus that makes it easy to slap onto the web.</p>

<p>Then why not use InDesign in the first place? :-o There are several other amuzing things about this thread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it PostScript, Type 1 and now OpenType have not solved real problems and you didn’t like them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas, choice in any of the three was not an issue, so WE LOVE &lsquo;EM, LOVE &lsquo;EM &amp; LOVE &lsquo;EM! Do these &lsquo;standards&rsquo; have the guts, balls and smarts to take on the dynamic networked low res typographic requirements of the planet? apparently not.

<p>&ldquo;Technologies tend to coexist more often then they throttle each other to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mmmm, this may be true, more elsewhere than in software. One could make a strong case that the T1 and TT technologies throttled each other to death, in the bleak and blurry view of the web honchos at least.</p>
<p>Then of course, what columns fill up with is far more important than the columns themselves. I mean&hellip;have shorter and/or justified lines of text ever made it easier to compose badly designed and/or poorly rendered type into &lsquo;good typography&rsquo;? We&rsquo;ve all seen fixed columns s&rsquo;plode on impact when users have the audacity to pick their own type size.</p>

<p>Shutting out retail/commercial fonts from adoption by any web font scheme is paranoid, nonsensical, unworkable. Come down out of your ivory tower, Håkon Lie.

You want everybody to adopt your standards, yet you ply them with contempt and mistrust for the makers of high quality fonts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The CSS spec makes delivering high quality typesetting impractical. Stop wasting my time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And unless I missed something, nothing to do with CSS. CSS doesn&rsquo;t shut any particular font out.</p>

<p>I think we&rsquo;d be surprised at how much code IS &lsquo;legacy&rsquo; code each year. I had to use up a $50 Circuit City gift certificate yesterday.

<p>Anyways, I don&rsquo;t think Prince has anything to do with &lsquo;the end of print&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s specifically designed FOR print.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>CSS is hopelessly inadequate as a set of style rules for professional typesetting. I’m not going to bother digging through the CSS3 Text Module, next to none of which is actually supported anyway, but I assure you I cannot specify that a certain paragraph have a certain letterspacing, use only proportional lining figures, use all small caps (sic), and be followed by one specified other paragraph style that uses only a certain subset of available contextual alternates. CSS cannot even look inside OpenType fonts for specific features (though browsers can and do, often outside of anyone’s control – Zapfino displays with more and more ligatures with each browser rev).</p>
<p>Even adequately specifying the name of a font is difficult in  CSS. (Try specifying exactly one variant of Thesis so it works in more than one non-braindead browser.) There’s the additional complication that print CSS cannot even reliably get the <code>pt</code> unit right across browsers and platforms.</p>
<p>Many brute measurements, like offsets and indents, can be specified in CSS, but we need more than brute force, we need finesse.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James&hellip;thanks for the clarification. No worries on topic drift&hellip;I think I&rsquo;m as guilty as anyone&hellip;</p>
<p>joe&hellip;your gripes are perfectly valid in the context of most web browsers out there. CSS isn&rsquo;t necessarily the issue, but the fact that most CSS support in browsers is partial, or just plain wrong.</p>
<p>So, I guess I&rsquo;m saying that the gripe most of us have isn&rsquo;t necessarily with the spec, but the lack of support for said spec in most CSS rendering agents. That&rsquo;s where Prince starts to appeal to me (in theory, at least) as it DOES seem to support the CSS spec to a much greater extent.</p>
<p>P.S. any interest in inviting Day and Lie into the conversation?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree emphatically with Joe that referencing fonts in CSS is fundamentally broken. It&rsquo;s an even bigger problem because a lot of apps and other &ldquo;things&rdquo; out there want to &ldquo;use&rdquo; CSS as part of their text model, and when they try to deal with how one specifies a specific font, they have to deal with the fact that what constitutes a font &ldquo;family&rdquo; is fundamentally ambiguous and under-specified in CSS.</p>
<p>Each implementer usually ends up coming with their own, incompatible notion of how the CSS spec maps fonts and families to <em>actual specific fonts</em> and the end result is not pretty. I&rsquo;ve seen many software dev teams hit this issue over the years, especially recently.</p>
<p>You know it&rsquo;s a problem when somebody has to write an 18-page spec on how to get from actual fonts to CSS font families and individual fonts.</p>
<p>That being said, I&rsquo;m not convinced there is any fundamental barrier to doing pretty good typography in CSS some day. It will probably need some extensions to CSS, whether that&rsquo;s CSS 4 (or later) or something more proprietary.</p>
<p>But it would be a mistake to dismiss the entire concept just because the current implementation is limited. Metal typesetters made fun of phototype at first, and phototypesetters thought digital type was much too limited&hellip; but each technology evolved, and even the initial implementations often had compelling advantages that gained them many early converts. So it is with CSS based typography, I think.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was impressed with the presentation. Forget Håkon Lie&rsquo;s bashing of InDesign and his rather naiive take on fonts. It seems that Prince is the brainchild of Michael Day, whom I instantly liked based on his balanced and toned down presentation style. He seems to be observant, respectful and willing to improve his product. Håkon&rsquo;s role in the company seems to be more of the networker and talking head &ndash; a pity that he has so many qualities that split and ignite people.</p>
<p>Obviously, he has been looking at TeX when implementing Prince, and hopefully will continue to. TeX is one of the best automated typesetting systems out there, when it comes to text composition (I think only Adobe&rsquo;s current InDesign text engine can match it). But IMO, it is hopelessly obsolete when it comes to the input &ndash; the language is insular and rather awkward to learn. It is clear that 15 years ago, it was the reference model for text layout &ndash; after all, RTF was derived from the TeX notation. But today, the SGML-HTML-XML markup paradigm has clearly won.</p>
<p>I think the war &ldquo;against&rdquo; CSS is lost &ndash; it is my firm belief that the typographic community has to accept, embrce and then try to extend it. We should learn to talk to people such as Håkon Lie, form a coalition of people interested in quality text composition and promote our ideas among the web people.</p>
<p>In fact, unlike Håkon Lie, many of the &ldquo;web people&rdquo; do appreciate the 500-year old legacy of traditional printing, with all its legibility optimization process. If the web wants to become the new book, it needs to learn from the vast knowledge amassed within the school of old book. It is quite obvious that web developers and also browser developers typically come from a different angle &ndash; so now is the time to educate them about the reasons why typography is not just for people who deal with lead.</p>
<p>I do have some ideas in the works :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>To jump into the conversation, I would like to say that in my personal opinion the web has been a giant leap forwards for worldwide information distribution, and a giant leap backwards for high-quality typography and typesetting. However, we believe that it&rsquo;s possible to do something about the latter, and Prince is the result of our efforts to make printing a first-class citizen of the web.</p>
<p>We still have a long way to go, and as was mentioned in the Tech Talk we have only just begun to scratch the surface when it comes to hyphenation, OpenType features and other fun stuff. However, we&rsquo;re always interested in hearing new feature requests. Further up the thread someone mentioned that it is impossible to apply certain OpenType features with CSS, this is something that we would like to support in Prince, so that decorative swashes or old-style numerals could be selected using the font-variant property (which currently only supports small-caps) or some other mechanism.</p>
<p>There is also the question of fonts on the web, but this seems to rouse strong feelings on both sides and should perhaps be sequestered in a thread of its own :)</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<p>Not quite sure what part of the conversation you are referring to, but in the context of Prince, from my perspective, it&rsquo;s not about WYSIWYGifying the web, but rather leveraging the ability of CSS for print, which, up to this point, hasn&rsquo;t been supported by any application to an extent that would even make it remotely feasible for print publishing.</p>

But I can&rsquo;t even manage to remember how to insert a link into a typophile post, so a code-based layout program doesn&rsquo;t sound very appealing to me. My limited web expertise is Dreamweaver which has suited me just fine, but I recognize its limitations in terms of code. For someone whose orientation is web (or code) based, adapting CSS to print (if this becomes possible) would seem like a natural step.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just sit here using my layout programs and wait for the web to catch up in terms of precision and quality. I&rsquo;m certainly not going to learn a confusing new app (CSS) until that happens.</p>

The same as a text or photo box in InDesign, with stylesheets on the side determining margins and text and stuff.</p>
<p>You want three boxes. You want this box here, this box here, and this box here. I want one 12pt em space separating them all. I want the text to be like so in this box, and like so in the other two. And I want a photo with a keyline with a 12pt em space around it in one of the boxes.</p>
<p>Sounds easy, right? The actual CSS for that is incredibly easy. The big problem is that none of the browsers will read your spacing requirements the same. Safari/FF/IE will all space things differently, and your layout WILL BREAK if designed according to proper specifications.</p>
<p>What looks cool about Prince is that it will simply <em>do what you wanted it to do to begin with</em>, according to your valid HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>DanGayle, your three-“box” layout will break in IE6, not in non-braindead browsers. You can take care of IE using conditional comments, which will leave you feeling only moderately impure.</p>
<p>Patty, you have probably been looking at tag-soup HTML. I assure you that standards-compliant HTML is a concept that can be learned in eight minutes flat and is easy as pie to do. If blind teenagers can learn it (<em>after</em> deprogramming them from tag-soup methods), you can, too.

<p>You even can’t be sure about that; CSS is not limited to visual media. One can also define <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/aural.html">aural stylesheets</a> with it. (Admittedly, this has nothing to do with Prince.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for inviting me in. I see that my tounge-in-cheek remarks about InDesign users in the corner has caused some remarks. I think InDesign will live a long and happy life, but I do believe the web will live even longer. Including CSS. Which is why it&rsquo;s important that it works well for all sorts of uses.</p>
<p>I proposed CSS in 1994 and it&rsquo;s been an important part of my life since then. My motivation for doing this work is twofold. First, it&rsquo;s important that the markup languages of the web are spared from holding all the typographic and presentational information that we want to associate with documents. Second, we need ways to express beautiful typography and design for web documents.</p>
<p>I have described CSS and compared it with other style sheet languages in my PhD Thesis:</p>
<p><a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2006/phd/">http://people.opera.com/howcome/2006/phd/</a></p>
<p>So far, I think CSS has been reasonably successful in establishing a baseline foundatation for style sheets on the web, and &ndash; by now &ndash; all browsers supports CSS1 reasonably well. It&rsquo;s also clear that much work remains in advancing the specifications further, and to ensure that they are interoperably implemented by browsers and other formatters (e.g., Prince). I think the Typofile community can play an important role here.</p>
<p>One of the things I have been pushing in the last year is web fonts. The web is stuck with 10 or so fonts that Microsoft published in 1996. They have served us well, but we need more fonts in order to improve typography on the web. There are thousands of freely usable fonts on the web but there is a missing link; browsers don&rsquo;t support the linking of fonts from style sheets to font files. I&rsquo;m trying to change this; I want browsers to support the CSS2 specification from 1996 which described how to do this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.news.com/Microsofts-forgotten-monopoly/2010-1032_3-6085417.html">http://www.news.com/Microsofts-forgotten-monopoly/2010-1032_3-6085417.html</a>
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssatten">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssatten</a></p>
<p>Prince now supports Web Fonts, as does nightly builds of Safari. We&rsquo;re working on it in Opera, too.</p>
<p>A common argument against webfonts is that not all TrueType files out there are good enough for web use. They may have limited unicode coverage, lack ligatures or simply look horrific. Some people have commisioned studies that say only a fraction of the fonts are suitable for web use!</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s great news! 5% of thousands is still plenty of new fonts. As support for webfonts increase, I think web designers will start using them in creative ways which will result in more fonts being developed, with wider unicode coverage etc. The tide will rise for all of us.</p>
<p>Some of you may worry that webfonts is threat to your existing business models and that font piracy will increase when everyone can point to a font file on the web. While it&rsquo;s true that linking is very powerful, there are also ways to restrict it. For example, a web server can check the &lsquo;Referer&rsquo; field in HTTP and only serve fonts to those requests coming from a sanctioned list of documents. This is not a failsafe method &ndash; it&rsquo;s probably as easy to crack as the EOT obfuscation &ndash; but it will stop much abuse.</p>
<p>On a more technical topic, I&rsquo;m working on extending the &lsquo;font-variant&rsquo; propoerty in CSS to better select fonts with OpenType features. Would this be of interest in this forum?</p>

<p>So you, uh, invented CSS huh? Cool. Not quite Tim Berners-Lee, but still cool.</p>
<p>I think one problem that you&rsquo;ll run into when discussing web fonts is that your 5% &ldquo;good enough for web use&rdquo; free fonts is in most Typophile&rsquo;s estimates, 4.9% too high. (No offense James or Nick and Co.)</p>
<p>Granted, there are some fonts available out there that are of excellent quality with an open license like the Vera fonts, Charter, etc., but I for one do not want to see a worldwide web populated with the likes of Black Chancery or any of the [[http://web.archive.org/web/20061202224255/http://www.somethingawful.com/fake/fontsite/index.htm|2002 Honest Fonts]].</p>
<p>Inevitably, someone will put commercial fonts on a server in Russia, and allow people to hotlink off of it. While Adobe, or certainly Berthold, would love to go hunting with cease and desist orders, the hard-working men and women of this website simply don&rsquo;t have the financial backing to go hunting after every single abuse. It&rsquo;s just not reasonable.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You can think of it this way:</p>
<p>People have always distributed commercial fonts illegally. Will font embedding change that, principally? Not really. However, the fonts that will be linked against web pages will be much easier to discover than the illegally distributed archives that are RARed, ZIPped, password protected and uploaded on rapidshare.com or something like that. And, sure, there will be some additional piracy going on, but there will be also a chance to obtain additional license fees from legitimate customers who will WANT to embed their fonts into wed pages using the direct linking mechanism. A font foundry will have a good argument to charge additional money for that type of license &ndash; the foundry can argument that, indeed, the font files are being made accessible to the public without any protection, so the customer has to pay considerably more.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the pirates wouldn&rsquo;t have paid anyway, so the loss is only theoretical, while the potential gain is actual since there are real money-making possibilities due to additional licensing sales. OpenType was one chance to cash in on potential font upgrades to clients who had happily used their Type 1 fonts before that. The Euro character also such a chance. Web font embedding will be another.</p>

Adam</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Håkon - I&rsquo;m so pleased to see you&rsquo;ve made it to this forum. I commend your work on CSS and bringing typographic control to the web. What seems missing in your efforts (which I believe are laudable and sincere) is the advice of professional typographers. You need the consultation of people who are not necessarily web designers, but experts in readability, type selection, and typesetting fundamentals. Opening your door to Typophile, which is full of such experts, is a great first step.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Welcome to the Typophile forums Håkon Lie. We are most keen to have you here and very keen to discuss the future of CSS and embedded web fonts. Thank you for coming along :^)</p>
<p><em>And, sure, there will be some additional piracy going on, but there will be also a chance to obtain additional license fees from legitimate customers who will WANT to embed their fonts into wed pages using the direct linking mechanism. A font foundry will have a good argument to charge additional money for that type of license — the foundry can argument that, indeed, the font files are being made accessible to the public without any protection, so the customer has to pay considerably more.</em></p>
<p>That sounds okay in theory. In practice, how much extra in the way of additional licensing fees will font makers or vendors deem such usage to be worth, and will customers be willing to pay that amount for using a font on a webpage?</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, I imagine I would be charging between $500 and $1000 U.S, possibly a good deal more, for this kind of licensing, depending on the font. And I&rsquo;m only a smallfry independent font maker. How much would a large &lsquo;foundry&rsquo; charge? Some of them put up to a million dollars into the development of one font (or a font family, say). If only two license sales are possible for web use, the fee will be hefty.</p>
<p><em>In my opinion, the pirates wouldn’t have paid anyway, so the loss is only theoretical, while the potential gain is actual since there are real money-making possibilities due to additional licensing sales.</em></p>
<p>The potential gain in large one-off license sales for web use I can see, but font makers who put their wares up for this arrangement can virtually kiss future retail license sales of their commercial font products goodbye once those fonts become widely distributed for free courtesy of the server somewhere in Russia syndrome.</p>

<p>No problem Dan. I agree with your estimate. 5% is 4.9% too high.</p>
<p><em>&hellip;the hard-working men and women of this website simply don’t have the financial backing to go hunting after every single abuse. It’s just not reasonable.</em></p>
<p>This is true. I don&rsquo;t have the resources required to deal with piracy on such a scale, neither does Nick Curtis, or Ray Larabie, or anyone else we consider independent.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Sure thing. When developing websites, people pay for hosting services, web development, design, photos. And people who make print publications regularly pay for fonts. I think companies will be delighted to pay for font web use if this will allow them to break free from the Verdana-Georgia-Arial closet.</p>
<blockquote>

products goodbye once those fonts become widely distributed for free 
courtesy of the server somewhere in Russia syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtually ALL commercial fonts ARE already in distribution &ldquo;for free courtesy of the server somewhere in Russia syndrome&rdquo;, and have been FOR YEARS &ndash; just like software from Microsoft, Adobe, FontLab etc. &ndash; on Usenet, rapidshare, various forums, BitTorrent etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>I have not seen font distributors or software distributors &ldquo;kissing goodbye retail sales&rdquo; in the past years. Plus, as I said &ndash; unlike illegitimate use in print, which is difficult to track down, illegal use of fonts that will be linked directly to web pages will be the easiest thing to discover. After all, that use will be indexed by Google and stored pretty much forever at archive.org.</p>
<p>The fact that I put up an image or a font on my site and use it with my content does not mean that that image or font is &ldquo;available for free&rdquo;. Everyone knows that they cannot freely use any stuff just because they were able to download it from &ldquo;the internets&rdquo; &ndash; including software, graphics, and now fonts. Most people are very aware of what piracy is, and know at least the fundamental difference between legitimate and illegitimate use of software assets. If font distributors make it easy enough for people to pay for those assets and use them the way they wish, people WILL pay.</p>
<p>Why am I sure? Because that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re already doing. It is already easy to download pirated fonts from a number of sources, and it is quite possible to extract font outlines from PDF documents, Flash files, Word documents. And? People are still paying for fonts. Chris, kids have been paying for mobile phone ringtones and icons, and that business is worth millions.</p>
<p>Pirates can rub their butts sore uploading fonts to Russian servers all day long &ndash; yet only a considerably small proportion of users will link to those and use them. And those users wouldn&rsquo;t probably pay anyway. But once this thing sets off, the people who HAVE THE MONEY and are willing to pay WILL PAY.</p>
<p>Facebook has over 50 million users, MySpace is rumored to have twice as many. I dare to say that no less than 5% of those would be willing to pay a small amount of money (like $10) for the ability to customize their profile appearance using a different font. It&rsquo;s a fraction of what people spend on buying silly t-shirts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Adam, I understand the rationale of the scenario you propose&mdash;there is a lot to be said for positive thinking on this issue, as font makers and those selling licences can do a lot worse than changing their license terms and conditions to suit a new business model, like not changing it or making it more restrictive.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think the new situation is not as simple as proponents make it out to be. We need more input on this from larger font makers and vendors. My perspective is of limited scope. It has been a while since I monitored font piracy, so the current extent of it is unfamiliar.</p>

<p>@DanGale: <em>My EULA will prohibit screen rendering. In fact, it already does.</em></p>
<p>Well, there you go. That&rsquo;s the reation. I appreciate why it&rsquo;s going that way. It seems there is a degree of paranoia involved, fueling the ever-more-restrictive EULA. I have resisted the trend for years and have no plans to make my EULAs more restrictive.</p>
<p>Dan, if your proposed EULA prohibits screen rendering, does that mean vendors will not be permitted to show potential buyers what your font(s) look like? If so, selling any retail licenses at all will be rather difficult.</p>
<p>The answer is to trust everyone, but cut the cards. In other words, at a minimum you should trust vendors and media buyers to render and assess your fonts online, but if they abuse your trust, then do something about it.</p>

&lsquo;Twas a joke, kind sir.</p>
<p>@Adam
I like your approach. Instead of worrying about what kind of money a foundry might be losing via pirates, a foundry might instead start worrying about what profit making opportunities they might be missing out on.</p>
<p>I like the ringtone analogy, but it might fit the big boys better than the small foundries. The record labels are sitting on old music that isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. There&rsquo;s no cost to sell an Eagles tune, since all of the production and expenses were paid back in the 70s. Now all they have to do is sell the crap out of it, and it&rsquo;s pure gold.</p>
<p>Same with Mono/Lino, etc. They have all of these typefaces that have already been designed and digitized sitting around in digital dustbins, so why not push them out there and make more profit off of it <em>if someone is willing to pay</em>?</p>

<p><em>&hellip;if someone is willing to pay?</em></p>
<p>Yep. I don&rsquo;t mind as long as  s o m e b o d y  is paying.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I release a font with provisions in the EULA that allow embedding on webpages, and charge $500 for one customer&rsquo;s use of the font on a website (multiple webpages). If the font file the customer installs on their server is not protected (how else can users viewing the web page see the font in their browsers?), dozens if not hundreds of enterprising clever dicks will make copies of the font file and distribute it without authorization. The next potential customer who wants to use my font on a webpage is not likely to shell out any money at all for a license fee if my font becomes freely distributed, when they can link to an unorthorized copy for zero cost. I&rsquo;m talking about  w i d e l y  d i s t r i b u t e d, actual font files. Extracting outlines from PDFs doesn&rsquo;t have the same impact that distribution of the font file does.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>From the recent survey I did involving foundries and embedding for the web (and Si please assist on this)</p>
<p>30 were surveyed
of these, 12 allowed some sort of embedding
of these, 7 wanted additional licensing</p>
<p>I think there are people who might be willing to pay additional fees. But I say might with emphasis. I think foundries are lucky, and they know it, (in general) to get the first fee for which they ask, let alone additional fees. I do think the larger corporations are different, but how different? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>An aside. Yes there are many people who upload and download at will. Yes at the end of the day it is, as Adam said, only a theoretical loss. But, I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that of those who do download many are designers who shouldn&rsquo;t be doing it to begin with. So, it is money lost and it isn&rsquo;t something that can just be chalked up as a theoretical loss. Designers are taking advantage of it and so are taking advantage of the foundries.</p>

<p>Yes, I understand how that works, and how easily you or anyone else who wants to can obtain my fonts for nothing. So I give unscrupulous users less reason to distribute my work illicitly by making some of my fonts downloadable from the authorized vendor (Myfonts) for zero cost, with the option to purchase a license if they want to use it on a paying job and believe in doing the right thing.</p>
<p>In practice, only a dozen or so people each year purchase licences for the fonts I make available with an optional free license. Hundreds more download the free license version and I know (because I&rsquo;ve seen the evidence) many of them use the fonts for profit. If I offered the same dual license/try before you buy deal for everything in my catalog, the revenue would not even cover operating costs&mdash;I would operate at a loss and probably give up releasing retail fonts.</p>

<p>(those) Uses not addressed in my EULA are permitted by default of common law. It&rsquo;s a free world. What I don&rsquo;t explicitly prohibit in writing is permitted.</p>

Can we get off the topic of embedding for a while and discuss the otehr aspects of CSS that need to be sorted out please?

<p>If it&rsquo;s a font from a &ldquo;major foundry&rdquo; you can probably get hold of it easily for free, once you know how. The fact that you and Adam both know how to obtain major commercial font products for free makes me wonder about your professionalism, and that of others, as far as working designers go. Forgive me for making that remark&mdash;I am not trying to personally attack anyone here, but citing an example of how faith in wider trust of an industry can be so easily eroded by a few who are in the know (in the loop).</p>
<p>The fonts I make are much, much harder to come by illicitly because they&rsquo;re not as extensively marketed as the products of larger players, so there is less demand for them. That&rsquo;s one reason why I value being an independent and have stayed independent. It&rsquo;s a way of protecting my best interests. Working for a &ldquo;major foundry&rdquo; entails a greater risk of having your work knocked off.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have not read this whole thread, but I&rsquo;ll throw this out there anyway. Web fonts are thriving in Korea at the moment. Cyworld, the popular Korean website that offered personal spaces on the web years before MySpace, is selling about 25,000 web fonts a day, which amounts to 10 billion won (about 10 milion US dollars) in sales per year.</p>
<p>Users buy web fonts so they can personalize their &ldquo;mini homepages&rdquo;, bulletin board and forum entries, and email messages on websites like Cyworld and other large network orportal sites. Web fonts are predominantly pixel fonts, and this has been a big part of their success in Korea. Because Korean fonts for print require hangul, with thousands of glyphs, they often require years of work and can be quite expensive. There is not much variety, either. But pixel fonts can be produced in a tiny fraction of the time, and thus hundreds of hangul web fonts have sprung up, produced by traditional type foundries as well as new outfits devoted to web fonts.</p>
<p>I must confess I do not know much about this phenomenon, since my primary interest is in print typography. I&rsquo;ve never bought a web font, and I&rsquo;m not really interested in doing so.</p>
<p>A few quick points&hellip; The Korean web environment is different from what you may be used to. Koreans are used to buying a lot of virtual items like personalized avatar elements and items needed for multi-user games. Also, many spend an inordinate amount of time on the large Korean websites that provide the web font services. Finally, none of these web fonts that I&rsquo;ve seen are suitable for print, as the vast majority are pixel fonts, and even those that are not are heavily compromised for screen use.</p>

<p><cite>Now THERE’s a thought. Bitmap only fonts. </cite></p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s really no solution. We already had the hype around (super pixel) flash fonts, but I&rsquo;m glad that this is going away. That&rsquo;s not the way the web should work.</p>
<p>But why does it have to be a black or white discussion? Lets say you have a font family in 6 weights and 4 optical sizes. You don&rsquo;t need to offer all this with a web license. Just select a single display style or a little font family of 2 or 4 styles, optimize them for the screen and offer only those styles for web embedding. You may not only make profit with those styles, but you will also advertise the whole font family.</p>

<p>It makes you <em>worry</em> about our professionalism? I would think the opposite should be true. I think it wouldn&rsquo;t be very professional of me to talk about an issue that I have no clue of. Sure, there are such people but I don&rsquo;t like belonging to them.</p>
<p>Just like many other colleagues involved in font work, I&rsquo;ve been looking at the situation in the piracy world. Whenever a new source of pirated fonts surfaces, or a substantial number of pirated fonts appears in the known channels, I, along with others, inform the respective right owners — some of them take legal steps while others let it roll. I have also helped uncover other kinds of piracy — those when a designer uses other font&rsquo;s outlines to create derivative fonts that he then tries to sell as his own. And of course I have experimented with font extraction from PDF or Flash documents — how else would I be able to advise any of my clients (various font vendors large and small) on its viability.</p>
<p>The nature of my work is font business and technology. My clients pay me to have knowledge and assist them with it when they need it. I think it would be very unprofessional of me if I based my knowledge only on reading the tealeaves.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly, one Korean foundry, Yoon Design, do something similar. They offer a single weight each of hangul serif and sans faces optimized for the web (spacing, hinting, maybe even bitmaps for common web sizes) for free to those who register on their website. Perhaps it helps in developing brand loyalty and getting users to try out their more extensive ranges of typefaces for print.</p>

<p>I am sorry if I implied you lack professionalism Adam. Obviously your line of work differs very much from mine. I&rsquo;m tuned in to mainly to design and marketing concerns as an indie &ldquo;foundry&rdquo;, whereas you deal mainly with font technology.</p>
<p>@Sii: <em>So why do you call out other formats in your EULA?</em></p>
<p>The document is out of date, and I&rsquo;ve been lazy and unprofessional getting it up to date. You&rsquo;re complaining about a clause that is permissive in nature, because it specifies some formats and not others. I could update it tomorrow with the recent formats you mention, and webpage embedding and so on, and somebody will invent a brand new document format, making my EULA instantly out of date.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, formats and uses of ST products not covered by the out of date EULA are permitted. I have never had any legal problems or disputes of any kind with any of my clients or purchasers of ST products.</p>

<p>I take it that none of us taking part in this discussion are legal professionals, and for that reason critiquing legal matters comes down to one peron&rsquo;s professional opinion versus that of the next.</p>
<p>Arbo: <em>The fact that you and Adam both know how to obtain major commercial font products for free makes me wonder about your professionalism</em></p>
<p>I did mean &ldquo;wonder&rdquo;, not worry. It&rsquo;s fair to say I worry about people&rsquo;s morality, but that applies to the whole human race. Adam you defended your professional need to know the technical details of outline extraction, which is perfectly professional for your line of work, &ldquo;And of course I have experimented with font extraction from PDF or Flash documents — how else would I be able to advise any of my clients (various font vendors large and small) on its viability.&rdquo; I wish to point out that I did not question that activity. I wondered aloud about the morality of a person in Dan&rsquo;s position knowing where to obtain illicit copies of major retail fonts. Apologies to Dan too. I was pondering the moral compromise inflicted on designers as an industry by the wonderous digital media revolution and all its foibles.</p>

<p>Er? Sorry, but I don&rsquo;t follow this line of reasoning. I made the basic point that for ideas (like Hakon&rsquo;s Web font idea) to take root they need to be supported by commercial font makers, and the place they would show this support is in their EULAs (basic or extended). I also observed that font vendors have been going in the opposite direction in recent years clamping down in their EULAs on any technology they perceive (rightly or wrongly) as putting their IP in harm’s way.</p>
<p>Do you need to be a lawyer to make these observations?</p>

<p>I keep being told to be extra-nice to David Berlow, because (I am also immediately thereafter told) he’s been “doing this forever” and none of the rest of us have. But his remark above is nonsense. It masquerades  as an expert’s posing an intractable question none of the peons had managed to think of before.</p>
<p>HTML elements have explicit or implied semantics. The most useful distinction, which, contradictorily, is intrinsically presentational, is the classification of elements as either <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#q5">block-level</a>; <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#q7">inline</a>; or, for a rare subset of elements (<code>iframe</code>, <code>del</code>, <code>ins</code>), either. Block-level elements act like paragraphs (notionally, with a carriage return before and after) and inline elements fit inside lines.</p>
<p>These categories are, however, overridable with CSS, as via <code>display: inline</code> and <code>display: block</code>. (That’s how standards-compliant Web pages style navbars – unordered lists, a block-level element – as nice little rows of words you can click.)</p>
<p>Now, in principle every single element in HTML can be styled in other ways, and the other ways germane to this discussion involve font, size, leading, and foreground and background colour. Indention can be styled for some elements. A small number of elements are hard to style  (<code>abbr</code>/<code>acronym</code>, <code>q</code>, <code>button</code>, <code>fieldset</code>/<code>legend</code>), but those are due to browser bugs, not flaws in the spec.</p>
<p>In short, then, dberlow, the answer to your question is as follows: The dividing line is <em>right where we’ve been telling you it is all along</em>, between HTML (structure) and CSS (presentation).</p>
<p>Purely presentational elements (not a misprint) like <code>font</code> and <code>center</code> simply aren’t used in standards-compliant authoring. An additional grey area comes up with other purely presentational elements, namely <code>b</code>/<code>i</code>/<code>u</code>, whose application in the context of Web standards used to be debated quite a bit. Now people know that you can use those elements if you are, for example, transcribing a(n) historical text that uses bold, italics, or underline in a way that other elements, like <code>cite</code>, <code>em</code>, or <code>strong</code>, cannot capture. These borderline edge cases do not vitiate the explicit principle, at work every minute of the day on the Web and easily learned by Googling or reading any of a dozen books, that HTML marks up page structure and CSS specifies appearance. This is noncontroversial and it’s tiresome to have to beat this dead horse.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think web documents should hold any typographic or presentational information. Instead they should link to style sheets that can be reused and cached. The web is diverse and the final presentation should be made as close to the user as possible. There, more information about the user&rsquo;s environment is available, and the presentaion can be optimized on a per-user basis.</p>
<p>dberlow: <em>The essence of this second thing, expressing beautiful typography, is not possible without the opposite of your first thing: at least the ’option’ of a typographic specification specific to the font needs of the user of a web site.

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I understand your question. Does your &lsquo;where&rsquo; refer to where in the document? Style sheets languages offer selectors with high enough specificity to address single elements (e.g., #foo in CSS). So, you can create highly customized presentation while maintaining the separation of content and presentation.</p>

<p>Right :-)</p>
<p>Most web users, however, will be happy with the 4.9%. And many will be overjoyed by the remaining 95% as well. For use in headlines, in latin scripts, many of them are suitable. Ransom notes is another use case. I think it&rsquo;s wrong to focus on the quality of current fonts, though. It&rsquo;s like saying the web is a failure because you wouldn&rsquo;t want to read 99.9% of the pages that people publish.</p>
<p>I believe high-quality fonts will be made legally available if browsers learn how to do web fonts. It may be open-source fonts, commercial limited-range fonts, commercial fonts restricted by the &lsquo;Referer&rsquo; HTTP header, or through new business models that none of us have thought of. But it will happen.</p>

<p>Of course.
Fixing a defect, OpenType fonts containing superior characters could remedy the &ldquo;extra leading&rdquo; effect that accompanies reference numbers and the dreaded &ldquo;th&rdquo;.
Also, true small caps.</p>
<p>Here is a site that uses SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to access the contextual alternates in Handsome Pro:
<a href="http://culturalcartography.net">http://culturalcartography.net</a>
Apparently, they had a lot of difficulty with inconsistent implementation by different browsers, so the feature may not work for everyone.
Having OT features available via CSS would be easier than SVG, or the latest Flash capabilities.</p>

<p>I think that this is an awesome idea. You could take your presentation to the people necessary to make your ideas work in a non-crappy font way. For instance, if you could convince Mr. Berlow, he might follow through on my &ldquo;Roger Black custom fonts for magazine website&rdquo; scenario I joked about above.</p>
<p>Convince the source, the suppliers, designers, and users of fonts, and you effect millions of people worldwide who use web browsers.</p>

<p>A little late with the idea, a little early with the style. ;</p>
<p>Howcome: <em>&ldquo;There, [close to the user], more information about the user’s environment is available, and the presentation can be optimized on a per-user basis.&quot;</em></p>
<p>We are on the same track, Howcome, welcome.</p>
<p>Howcome: <em>&ldquo;I’m not sure I understand your question. Does your ’where’ refer to where in the document?&quot;</em></p>
<p>My &lsquo;where&rsquo; Howcome is the user environment too. I understand you, Howcome, to be proposing that the name of the font be passed to the network (and little else), installed on the client&rsquo;s machine, and turned over to the OS (and nothing else). That proposal is not, in my opinion, complete to the task at hand and as the OS' continue to diverge in their treatment of &lsquo;the same type data&rsquo;, that solution becomes less complete over time.</p>
<p>Besides being of concern to some type folk, your proposal implies that the consortium are not doing everything they can in this regard, nor are operating systems, browsers or foundries. Is this true!? But your proposal&rsquo;s scary to me because I can only &lsquo;lend&rsquo; property in the form of a box of shapes, but not the intellectual property that makes that box of shapes into the words users expected and got, in print.</p>
<p>Some say, I want to break it completely to fix it, but I don&rsquo;t. I want to expand the options from just letting the OS at it (ye olde single outline for the entire planet), to making the final font entirely via network (ye new bitmap for a single user), if required, with all the options in between available, if required (ye olde and new combination outline bitmap stoke font for the user with 4 screens on one desk). That&rsquo;s where we were pre-web and I think I can speak for 500 years when I say &ldquo;We liked it, and it worked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It still works, as I&rsquo;ve proved for numerous high-end screen font-craving clients, if I have all the answers I need, as opposed to lies, silence or being told I have pay for it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David,</p>
<p>but notice that the bulk of the web is switching from the idea of a thick server and thin clients over to distributed computing &ndash; simply because the users' PCs have a massive computing power at their disposal, so they can deal with rasterization, scaling, resolution adjustments etc. &ndash; while if you offload all those tasks to the servers, every content vendor will have to invest in massive server and bandwidth technology, and this technology will become usable for rich content vendors only.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re proposing is similar to &ldquo;soft ripping&rdquo; in prepress times &ndash; the computer would rasterize a document and send a finite bitmap down to the imagesetter, which would then slavishly render the dots. But the industry chose PostScript/PDF, where it would be the receiving devices that would have an intelligent driver that transforms a common interchange format (PostScript, later PDF) into the rasterized image, while the sending part would take care of generating that common code.</p>
<p>The web works similarly now: the sending part (the server) formats the content into an interchange form (HTML+CSS+PNG/GIF/JPG+(soon)TTF) while the receiver (a browser) is an intelligent &ldquo;driver&rdquo; that converts this common language into the user space, taking into account things like the resolution and size of the display, the navigational device at hand and other preferences set down by the user.</p>
<p>I think the best personalization/individualization can happen reasonably only at the user&rsquo;s end.</p>

Not that I&rsquo;m suggesting billions of streaming bitmaps, &lsquo;all&rsquo;, &lsquo;every&rsquo;, or &lsquo;finite&rsquo;, either but nice knee reflex. Fonts, unlike all other forms of web media don&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t need the magic of networking ever? Think hard, options are diminishing fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the best personalization/individualization can happen reasonably only at the user’s end.&rdquo;
You know my business — for whom do I provide personalization/individualization? and for whom is such personalization/individualization now important? Hmmmm?</p>
<pre><code>Then, on request, and from a city in Ilyria: Clark! What pale and soot soiled light from broken window spews? That mischievous son of Polyphemus must you be, to send streaking such plutonium-laden words. Alighting here as like from a squeaking propellor of the plains, spinning never less true from a garden of weeds, they bounce. Here! look upon thine own father in kind, great in bulk and creased of brow with but with one more eye than this son of accessibility. 

Should this sweet-speaking silver-tongued son of proud Palatino, friend of all wordsmiths, the one who made that traveling son of Laertes seem lazy, drop his lofty head to the instruction-littered ground like a hound to sniff at frozen-hearted meaning, or like a raven perch upon thine shaking shoulder to peck at thine ears 'til they become like shining pearls in the cold light of Apollo's fair sister?

<p>of course it&rsquo;ll be the client with deep pockets who will come first. Note that even if all the rendering is happening on the user&rsquo;s end after the browser has received the outline font, the content vendor is always free to personalize what he is sending to the user based on receiving such settings as the screen resolution, operating system, the actual browser used and other parameters.</p>

There&rsquo;s a whole lot-o-cachenation goin' on, maybe now font management will be able to evolve, e.g. to disable all but two or three languages if the user wanted not to be swamped with BS fonts from an unused languages, in the interest of being well-swamped with good reading fonts, e.g. One might complain their far eastern junk mail doesn&rsquo;t look so good, but you have to make sacrifices somewhere. I&rsquo;m not sure what the problem/question would be though, the MS Reader, e.g. installs fonts secretly from the U, they appear to work pretty well, and even if one likes to read, say, 20 newspapers a day, one would not have time to work on much else any way, so how many fonts does one need?</p>
<p>MT:<em>Could that “cache” be cleared every time you quit the browser?</em>
Absolutely. It&rsquo;s had me wondering for a while now, I mean, it shouldn&rsquo;t even take this long to get fonts kicked out of the Millennium Copyright Act Club.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re over-thinking the &ldquo;outlines&rdquo; issue because that&rsquo;s not the issue at all. Howcome is pushing for simply putting entire fonts on Web servers. If there are to be any protections at all, they are only present if a server admin puts them there. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ve simply got the fonts out there.</p>
<p>Now, other proposals, such as EOT, are still not massively secure either, but the general idea is that, as with PDF or other forms of embedding, it doesn&rsquo;t take massive security to keep the average person honest.</p>

<p>Actually, I just want a CSS spec that makes it clear, given a font, how one gets the &ldquo;font-family&rdquo; property from that font. Now, given that this has been unspecified for so long, maybe we need a new tag to go with the unambiguous spec. But <em>something</em> would be good.</p>

<p>Would you recommend that the W3C CSS recommendation should explicitly reference ISO/IEC 14496-22:2007 (Open Font Format, the ISO variant of OpenType)? I think it&rsquo;d be a good idea &ndash; of course CSS should remain being somewhat format-agnostic so theoretically it could work with BDF or Type 1. However, CSS might cite particular examples based on ISO 14496-22. I think that would be useful.</p>
<p>Is the OpenType Layout script, language and tag registry a part of ISO 14496-22?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not. Currently, EOT is on an equal footing with other font formats in the CSS specification in the sense that they are all listed:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/fonts.html#referencing">http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/fonts.html#referencing</a></p>
<p>Some people have argued that EOT should be given preferential treatment in CSS. This I&rsquo;m opposed to as I think TrueType and OpenType also have roles to play on the web. Therefore, I believe CSS should be agnostic wrt. font formats &ndash; they should all be &ldquo;equal standards&rdquo;, if you will.</p>
<p>So, it seems we&rsquo;re in agreement?</p>

<p>If the &lsquo;we&rsquo; you came to &lsquo;meet&rsquo; is folks with no typographic intellectual property of their own, little or none in the companies they represent, and no experience that I&rsquo;m aware of in improving either tools, technology or type on the web, &lsquo;You&rsquo; are in agreement.</p>
<p>And, if you only &lsquo;think&rsquo; &ldquo;TrueType and OpenType also have roles to play on the web&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t &lsquo;know&rsquo;, we&rsquo;ve not moved much closer to anything but more, (perhaps), of that nice &lsquo;free-for-all&rsquo; display type, e.g. Larabie.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK, Håkon, I think you’re misunderstanding the issue of specifying exactly one font, due perhaps to not being an expert in these sorts of things. (Which is fine! Which is why you’re here! And all I can say for myself is I always have valid CSS.)</p>
<p>The issue is that the font names presented to the computer user are variable, as are the exact filenames (highly variable when you compare PostScript and TrueType fonts, still somewhat variable in OpenType despite the marketing pitch that the same file works everywhere). Thesis is a worst-case scenario, given that there are over 250 variants. If I want <em>exactly one</em> weight, style, and width of Thesis, what <em>exact <code>font-family</code></em> syntax do I use to specify it for all non-braindead browsers?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a bit misleading.</p>
<p>OpenType and Type 1 are already public standards adopted by the ISO. EOT has heretofore been a proprietary and unpublished spec. In order to be broadly usable, EOT should be adopted and published by a standards body. But which one? As the whole point of EOT is to be a Web standard, the W3C is the obvious answer. I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone suggest that the W3C should endorse EOT <em>more</em> than any other format, just that the W3C be willing to be the holder of the EOT format.</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s not. People have suggested that the CSS WG recommends the use of EOT over other font formats. I was in the meeting.</p>
<p>Thomas Phinney wrote: <em>EOT should be adopted and published by a standards body. But which one?</em></p>
<p>It would be good to see the EOT specification published. It&rsquo;s always good when closed, proprietary formats are opened up. It&rsquo;s easy enough to do, just put the specification on the web.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the EOT format needs a standards body any more than DOC or PPT do &ndash; those specifications are, apparently, scheduled to be released soon. The people behind EOT are, of course, free to submit them anywhere they want. My only argument has been that work on font formats is outside the scope of CSS.</p>

<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>The interface between specs can sometimes be tricky as specs often are controlled by different people and organizations.</p>
<p>An extra complexity in this case is that CSS implemementations do not, in general, deal with font files directly. Browsers typically use the APIs and font renderers provided by the operating system they are running on, they don&rsquo;t open the font files themselves. As such, it would be more relevant to make demands on the operating systems and the APIs they expose than on the CSS specification.</p>
<p>BTW, the CSS specification briefly discusses the complexities of names here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/fonts.html#aname">http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/fonts.html#aname</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open for proposals, though. How would you describe how to map information from (say) OpenType to a font name?</p>

<p>This is good use case for Web fonts, I believe. Here&rsquo;s some sample code that will tie a set of descriptors to one unique URL:
<code>
@font-face {
  src: url(<a href="http://www.example.com/thesis-smallcaps-whatever);">http://www.example.com/thesis-smallcaps-whatever);</a>
  font-family: &ldquo;mythesis&rdquo;;
  font-style: italic; 
  font-weight: 500;
  font-variant: small-caps;
}
</code>
And here is one way to refer to it from the shorthand &lsquo;font&rsquo; property:
<code>
h2 { font: 500 italic small-caps 16pt/18pt &ldquo;mythesis&rdquo; }
</code></p>

<p>Surely it ought to be possible, for any font present on the user&rsquo;s system, to specify that font unambiguously.</p>
<p>Howcome points us to section 15.4.2, the &ldquo;Full font name.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; cited starts to scratch the surface of the problem, but doesn&rsquo;t actually try to solve it, not does it fully expose the complexity of the problem.</p>
<p>Even within a single platform, a given font can have multiple strings that have a legitimate claim to being the &ldquo;full font name.&rdquo; Saying that the browsers should just defer to the OS is useless given that HTML and CSS are supposed to be cross-platform.

<p>One possible solution is to require all CSS implementations to open font files directly and not through the system. In this principle is established, the CSS specification could go on to describe, in some detail, how to map information from all major font formats into values suitable for selection by the &lsquo;font-*&rsquo; properties.</p>

You&rsquo;re close enough now to see how hopeless it is to imagine a font&rsquo;s name containing all the information required, for any system or human, which needs to make font selection &ldquo;&lsquo;work&rsquo;, perhaps.</p>
<p>As Howcome says::

<p>I&rsquo;d be happier without your compliments, Joe.</p>
<p><em>But it still doesn’t let me choose TheSansB HT6 SemiBold with tabular ranging figures and alternate single-storey a.</em></p>
<p>You can do all but the single-storey a. In general, CSS cannot apply styles to characters, only to elements. So, we need to find property values that can be applied to the whole element without causing unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>I assume this code:
<code>
p { font-variant-storey: single }
</code></p>
<p>would be too general as it would apply to &lsquo;g&rsquo; as well. Another option would be to introduce the functional notation which is used for some values:
<code>
p { font-variant-storey: single(a) double(g) }
</code></p>
<p>In order to justify the cost it would be to introduce, specify, implement and test this feature we need to learn more about multi-storey characters. How many characters come in multi-storey varieties? In cyrillic? Other scripts? How do fonts label these alternates? How consistent is the labelling? Do font APIs offer this information to applications? Across all platforms?</p>

<p>Hi Mr Clark. Well, what could be better than directly referencing the font file, as suggested earlier by Mr Lie,</p>
<p>   @font-face {
      src: url(<a href="http://www.example.com/thesis-smallcaps-whatever);">http://www.example.com/thesis-smallcaps-whatever);</a>
      # additional properties which in combination identify this font</p>
<p>because: If you got a bunch of PST1 fonts which make stylistic alternate glyphs available in separate fonts (= styles), and if these separate fonts are identified by strings/abbreviations in the fonts' file name and menu names, and if the latter strings/abbreviation moreover are foundry-specific &ndash; how please should CSS be able to identify the correct font by just looking for &ldquo;two storey g&rdquo; in any font variant?
Let&rsquo;s assume that CSS would support the 20 Stylistic Set features, it would not know more about them than their names: &ldquo;Stylistic Set 1&rdquo;, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, &ldquo;6&rdquo; etc. Neither applications nor CSS can know what each does. Alternate g is of that category. Unless there&rsquo;s a registered feature dedicated to one- or two-storey a&rsquo;s and g&rsquo;s, your example is a bit unrealistic. I think you expect more from CSS than even OT specs offer.  ;-)</p>

The need for alternates has simply never come up in any of the hundred or so client dealings I&rsquo;ve had on this topic. It is similar, in my opinion, to concern for the adjustment of ones rear view mirror, after one has driven the car off of a cliff.  As if, anyone would be following.</p>
<p>Though, I&rsquo;d like to have the options capable of specifying type down to the smallest detail, alternated are simply not where to start. Without the option of a controlled pixelation, down to the exact x, y, and d of the type, kerning, tracking, alternates, ligatures, justification, hyphenation, leading, optical sizing, and to some extent, style selection, are just adding mud to the swamp, in text, and much display type as well. . .</p>

<p>But so have been a heck of a lot of &lsquo;typesetting&rsquo; technologies. Linotype non-kerning f, anyone?</p>
<p>The trouble with something like your single-storey ɑ use case is that this kind of variant is very much font-specific and always has been, and even if one were to construct a general mechanism for &lsquo;storey variants&rsquo;, as Håkon imagines above, one is still going to be left with dozens of other kinds of design-specific variants that fall between the cracks of such a mechanism, that do not correspond to an anticipated variant class and specified property. In typography as in linguistics there are &lsquo;free variables&rsquo;, and these basically require the equivalent of that earliest of typesetting technologies: the case of individual sorts from which the typesetter can grab the appropriate form and insert it in the composing stick. Adobe&rsquo;s glyph palette is the most direct equivalent, but OpenType stylistic alternate layout features are only one level above this and not much easier to address in terms of cross-font behaviour and, hence, generalised mark-up.</p>

<p><em>My tentative conclusion from our discussions is that referencing fonts in CSS is not «fundamentally broken»</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Thomas used the expression «fundamentally broken» I think what he had in mind was that with CSS it&rsquo;s easy to reference a font that is part of a small family (e.g. <code>font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;</code> will get you <em>Arial Italic</em>), but when the font family has more than the usual 4 styles (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic), like Minion Pro or Myriad Pro for example, then referencing a specific font is no longer easy. And it gets even more complicated when you try to find a solution that works for all the browsers. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<p>To reference <em>Minion Pro Bold Italic</em>, one would probably use the following code, right?
<code>font-family: &lsquo;Minion Pro&rsquo;;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: italic;
</code></p>
<p>If yes, then why do Safari and Firefox display different fonts, like so?
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/css_1_6546.png]</p>
<p>But things can get even more interesting. If one wants to reference <em>Minion Pro Medium Cond(ensed) Italic Display</em> this is the code you&rsquo;ll have to use for Safari,
<code>font-family: &lsquo;MinionPro-MediumCnItDisp&rsquo;;
font-style: italic;</code></p>
<p>and this is the code you&rsquo;ll have to use for Firefox,
<code>font-family: &lsquo;Minion Pro Med Cond Disp&rsquo;;
font-style: italic;</code></p>
<p>in order to get this:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/css_2_4815.png]</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t agree that&rsquo;s broken, then why am I getting different results for the same code, and why do I have to use different code to get the same results? Sure, you can blame the browsers for not be doing the right thing, BUT <strong>what is the &ldquo;right thing&rdquo;?</strong> Which name strings in the font are the browsers supposed to use? Should they just pick-and-choose Name IDs (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm</a>) as desired, or should the CSS spec give a clear guidance?</p>
<p>And in the example that tries to reference <em>Minion Pro Medium Cond(ensed) Italic Display</em> shouldn&rsquo;t the code be a lot more straight forward? Something like this, perhaps:
<code>font-family: &lsquo;Minion Pro&rsquo;;
font-style: &lsquo;Medium Cond Italic Display&rsquo;;</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[&hellip;] new variants in OpenType font warrants some new keywords on the ’font-variant’ property [&hellip;] but the exact list of keywords can’t be determined quite yet; it will depend on availability of fonts</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If by &lsquo;fonts&rsquo; you mean &lsquo;free fonts&rsquo;, then that last sentence will be closer to the truth&hellip;
Fonts with OpenType layout features <em>ARE</em> available, and the keywords <em>CAN</em> be determined. The keywords can be based on the features already registered (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featurelist.htm)">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featurelist.htm)</a>, and there are already hundreds of fonts that implement a lot of these features (e.g. Minion Pro, Myriad Pro, the ClearType collection, Palatino Linotype [in Win2000 and up], etc.). This thread has several examples of fonts with OT features: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/41231">http://typophile.com/node/41231</a></p>

<p>There is no requirement in CSS that browsers look inside the fonts, and noone has argued that they should have to do so. Browsers typically use system APIs to learn about the available fonts. So, it&rsquo;s better to ask system vendors about this, or look to the OpenType specification for guidance. It&rsquo;s outside the scope of the CSS specification.</p>
<p>«why do Safari and Firefox display different fonts?»</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. What system are you using, which versions of the browsers? A good place to ask the question is in the www-style mailing list.</p>
<p>«Fonts with OpenType layout features <em>ARE</em> available»</p>
<p>Yes, but most people don&rsquo;t have them. In order to motivate browsers to add features, you must tempt them with lots of potential users. Remember that browsers vendors have hundreds of great ideas to choose from and only so few developers. They are unlikely to add features if only a small subset of users will notice.</p>

<p>Anyone with MS Windows Vista or Office 2007 has several font families with typical OTL features for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic text typography. I don&rsquo;t think the problem is lack of potential users in terms of numbers of people, but lack of users who understand the potential, and they are unlikely to grasp that potential until they see standardised style mark-up syntax to access the layout features, just as most people wouldn&rsquo;t have understood the potential of CSS without seeing it: you had to invent it and evangelise it.</p>

<p><em>Browsers typically use system APIs to learn about the available fonts.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but it&rsquo;s not just a matter of getting a list of all the fonts available but rather getting an unique and clear pointer to a given font on that list. Yes, it&rsquo;s up to the systems to implement the APIs, but on the other hand it&rsquo;s up to CSS to clearly say what &lsquo;font-family&rsquo; corresponds to. Is it NameID#1 or NameID#16? If NameID#1, then what should be done in case the family has more than 4 styles?</p>
<p>As Thomas said, section 15.4.2 Full font name (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/fonts.html#aname">http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/fonts.html#aname</a>) only scratches the surface on this matter. There needs to be a clearer guidance from CSS, otherwise &lsquo;Full font name&rsquo; might mean the font&rsquo;s NameID#1 in one browser, and NameID#16 in another, for example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So, it’s better to ask system vendors about this, or look to the OpenType specification for guidance.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The OT spec gives absolutely no guidance on this matter. It only describes what each name string is. It doesn&rsquo;t say which names or how many names should be used to get an exact (cross-platform &amp; cross-browser) reference to a font. For example, some Adobe applications use NameID#6 in the documents they generate in order to have an unambiguous cross-platform reference to a font, while other apps use other NameIDs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yes, but most people don’t have them. In order to motivate browsers to add features, you must tempt them with lots of potential users. Remember that browsers vendors have hundreds of great ideas to choose from and only so few developers. They are unlikely to add features if only a small subset of users will notice.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know exactly what you mean as I have to deal with that fact in a regular basis. I wished InDesign had this and that but&hellip;</p>
<p>But browser support is not the matter here. Did you give up on the idea of CSS v3 just because no browser was supporting it at the moment? My point is, there&rsquo;s nothing stopping the W3C to specify the keywords now. Or are you waiting for each browser to come up with their own solution and then blame them for not following the spec (that was written <em>after</em> the fact)?</p>
<p>OpenType is here to stay, either you want it or not. The sooner CSS embraces it, the better for everyone. XAML already has <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms745109.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms745109.aspx</a> Now, shouldn&rsquo;t all those style attributes be implemented through CSS? I think so. Can CSS do it? You tell me&hellip;</p>

Forgive me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but broadly speaking aren&rsquo;t YOU the one suggesting the requirements? If the current requirements do not address a specific and isolated issue, why not address it?</p>
<p>An added benefit of so doing would be a further standardization of naming conventions for Open Type fonts. If all of the foundries know that the CSS spec will call for NameID#6, then all of the foundries will then make darn sure that the NameID#6 string is fully mapped out.</p>
<p>As the subject was originally about CSS specifying server-end fonts, the web designer/programmer will have access to the font files and access to all of the specific name ids associated with them. They could very easily find out exactly what the NameID#6 string is EXACTLY, then spec it up without worry.</p>
<p>The cascade could call for a specified font via the standardized name id, then fall back to a standard web font if some freak occurrence prevents the specified font from downloading and activating on the user end.</p>
<p>I like that idea, because I don&rsquo;t like having to string together an entire set of font properties that are already inherent in a font. Why call for Myriad Pro, but only the condensed version that happens to be an italic variant and only if it&rsquo;s the display weight instead of the file Myriad Pro Condensed Italic Display?</p>
<p>For a Word user, it might make sense. But we as Typophiles understand that every variant is a font in and of itself, not a magically bolder and slantier version of &ldquo;the&rdquo; font.</p>

<p>I have a few questions.</p>
<p>If I run this on a linux with the font installed I get:

$ fc-list : family | grep -i &lsquo;minion pro cond capt&rsquo;
Minion Pro,Minion Pro Cond Capt
</code></p>
<p>That is, fontconfig reports two names: «Minion Pro» and «Minion Pro Cond Capt». I assume it gets «Minion Pro» from some other field in the same file, do you know which one?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the style sheet says:
<code>
font-family: &ldquo;Minion Pro&rdquo;, sans-serif;
font-style: italic;
font-weight: 700;
font-stretch: condensed;

<p>«Minion Pro Cond Capt» is the Font Family name (sfnt name table ID 1). This is the name of the 4-style family which would consist of</p>
<ul>
<li>Minion Pro Cond Capt Regular</li>
<li>Minion Pro Cond Capt Italic</li>
<li>Minion Pro Cond Capt Bold</li>
<li>Minion Pro Cond Capt Bold Italic</li>
</ul>
<p>«Minion Pro» is the OpenType Preferred Family name (name table ID 16) which allows applications to display a single, larger family composed of the 4-style families. The style linking between the members of the 4-style families remains the same, only the presentation to the user differs. The Preferred Family name is used in conjunction with the Preferred Subfamily name (ID 17).</p>
<p>[I think the term &lsquo;subfamily&rsquo; is potentially misleading; this is really synonymous with style and is particular to a single font within the family, not some kind of sub grouping.]</p>
<p>It would be quite nice, I think, if CSS made it possible to specify either the Font Family (ID 1) plus Font Subfamily (ID 2, style) as in Miguel&rsquo;s example, or the Preferred Family (ID 16) plus Preferred Subfamily (ID 17). So the same font, Minion Pro Bold Cond(ensed) Italic Caption, could be spec&rsquo;d as either</p>
<p><code>font-family: &ldquo;Minion Pro Cond Capt&rdquo;;
font-style: italic;</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>font-family: &ldquo;Minion Pro&rdquo;;
font-style: &ldquo;Cond Italic Caption&rdquo;;</code></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how feasible this is.</p>
<p>I presume the secondary properties</p>
<p><code>font-weight: 700;
font-stretch: condensed;</code></p>
<p>are only necessary as a fallback mechanism, e.g. if a default serif face is used instead of the specified font, in order to try to match the weight and width?</p>

<p><em>I assume it gets «Minion Pro» from some other field in the same file, do you know which one?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s both Microsoft NameID 16, like John said, and Macintosh NameID 1. Ideally, fonts in a large family will have these two strings match each other. If they don&rsquo;t match, fc-list will output both. The general format seems to be,
<code>MacNameID1,MSNameID16,MSNameID1:style=MacNameID2,MSNameID17,MSNameID2</code></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely something going on behind the scenes, because fc-list doesn&rsquo;t output all the NameID strings, even if they are present in the font. For example, according to the format above, the font MinionPro-BoldCnItCapt.otf would have been IDed as,
<code>Minion Pro,Minion Pro,Minion Pro Cond Capt:style=Bold Cond Italic Caption,Bold Cond Italic Caption,Bold Italic</code>
but what gets output is just,
<code>Minion Pro Cond Capt,Minion Pro:style=Bold Italic,Bold Cond Italic Caption</code></p>
<p>And MinionPro-BoldIt.otf outputs as,
<code>Minion Pro:style=Bold Italic</code>
but by the format above it would have been,
<code>Minion Pro,(font has no MSNameID16),Minion Pro:style=Bold Italic,(font has no MSNameID17),Bold Italic</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Which font should be selected?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the answer varies from browser to browser. I&rsquo;d say that those properties define &ldquo;Minion Pro Bold Italic Condensed&rdquo;. The problem with CSS is that it&rsquo;s build on the assumption that fonts in a family only vary by Weight, Width and Slope, which is true for most families but certainly not all. What about fonts that differ only by Optical Size? (Two fonts can have the same WWS, but one is designed to be used at large point sizes &ndash;Display&ndash;, and the other at small point sizes &ndash;Caption). And what about two fonts of the same family that only vary in design? (e.g. Shelley Allegro, Shelley Andante and Shelley Volante). CSS goes a step further than Windows, which differentiates fonts only by Weight (Regular, Bold) and Slope (Upright, Italic), but still falls short of what is necessary for describing a font by its properties.</p>
<p>The thing is, CSS tries to address two different things with the same set of properties. On one hand, the properties have to be as specific as possible so that the desired font(s) get selected. To achieve that we&rsquo;d only need two properties,
<code>nameOfFontFamily: &ldquo;Minion Pro&rdquo;;
nameOfStyleInFontFamily: &ldquo;Bold Italic Condensed Caption&rdquo;</code></p>
<p>But on the other hand, the font needs to be described by a set of general properties/characteristics so that, in case the desired font is not available, there&rsquo;s at least enough information to find a close match.</p>
<p>So, the main challenge is probably deciding where one of the operations ends and the other starts, i.e. when should browsers stop trying to find the font that equals the specified properties, and start guessing which font would be the better match.</p>
<p>Personally, I would like to be able to spec my font(s) in a typographic manner like I do in InDesign. That said, it would be great if CSS could provided two additional properties,
<code>font-typographicfamily: MacNameID1/MSNameID16
font-typographicstyle: MacNameID2/MSNameID17</code></p>
<p>But I understand that is important to provide general properties to describe the font(s); this way browsers don&rsquo;t have to apply heuristics to two name strings in order to find if the font is Bold, Italic or Condensed. Is it possible to combine the two approaches? I think so.</p>
<p>BTW, I experimented writing the CSS code for a few font families, based on my proposal from January 30th, and was quite surprised by the results I got in Firefox. About 85% of the fonts were selected and displayed correctly. One of the families, Kepler Std, was particularly interesting, since it has no less than 168 fonts!!
The results can be found at <a href="http://adhesiontext.com/typophile/CSSFontTest/">http://adhesiontext.com/typophile/CSSFontTest/</a></p>
<p>I must say the results in Safari were very disappointing. This browser seems to prefer the PostScriptName (Mac&amp;MS NameID6), but even with such specific pointer to the font(s), it failed to correctly display many of them. Some of which it couldn&rsquo;t even find. Perhaps there&rsquo;s something broken in the font matching mechanism.</p>

<p><em>Should the code above work? Should the code below work? Should they result in the same font?</em></p>

<p>This code below works, at least in Firefox 2.0.0.11 Mac. You can see it at <a href="http://adhesiontext.com/typophile/CSSFontTest/Firefox/MinionPro/">http://adhesiontext.com/typophile/CSSFontTest/Firefox/MinionPro/</a> It&rsquo;s the 5th font in the list.
<code>
font-family: &ldquo;Minion Pro Cond Capt&rdquo;;
font-style: italic;
font-weight: 400;
font-stretch: condensed;
</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>font-variant: caption; /* assuming we add the &ldquo;caption&rdquo; keyword */</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The optical size should not be seen as a variant in the same category as Small Caps or Ligatures. (Yes, there&rsquo;s the &lsquo;size&rsquo; OpenType feature which is to be used for controlling the Optical size, but that feature has an unique format and it looks like it was shoehorned into the GPOS table)
I see the Optical size as a font property at the same level as the font&rsquo;s Weight, Width or Slope, and therefore it ought to have its own keyword, e.g.
<code>font-opticalsize: 6pt;</code></p>
<p>The other thing to consider is that, historically, the optical size is an integer value between 6 and 72 (points). Therefore, the optical size shouldn&rsquo;t be defined as a finite set of names such as Caption, Subhead or Display. That was Adobe&rsquo;s approach, but there&rsquo;s no reason to do it that way, on the contrary. This system of names was good for educating the users &ndash;and even so, the terms are not interpreted the same way by all the users&ndash;, but it becomes problematic when new sizes need to be introduced.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>(Yes, there’s the ’size’ OpenType feature which is to be used for controlling the Optical size, but that feature has an unique format and it looks like it was shoehorned into the GPOS table)</em></p>
<p>David Lemon and I have chatted a couple of times about the possibility of deprecating the GPOS size feature, and replacing it with a dedicated &lsquo;size&rsquo; table. I suppose extending the OS/2 table would be another option. I&rsquo;ll bring this up on the OT list, since spec updates are currently under discussion.</p>
<p>I agree with your comments re. integer point sizes rather than names. However, one of the virtues of CSS is that it can produce dynamically scaleable layouts, so rather than having authors spec a particular optical size, I would much rather see browseres interpreting the CSS and then delivering an appropriate optical size of font, if available in the family, based on size, resolution and a &lsquo;size&rsquo; feature or table entry. I suppose having explicit <code>font-opticalsize</code> syntax would be useful if one wanted to override the automatic size selection, but the first order of business should be to get the latter working properly.</p>

<p>Maybe even give the end reader a control.
This could be compared to the Mac&rsquo;s &ldquo;Font Smoothing&rdquo; system preference controls, or perhaps somewhat like the Photoshop menu item for &ldquo;smoother/sharper/stronger&rdquo; type rasterizing.

<p>That&rsquo;s only true on Vista, I think. On other Windows versions, ’families' are only differentiated by weight and width. Otherwise &ldquo;Arial Narrow&rdquo; would be part of the &ldquo;Arial&rdquo; family. Or am I missing something?</p>

<p>It depends whom you ask. If it&rsquo;s a Windows system, the font family will be «Minion Pro Cond Capt». That&rsquo;s because a Windows-family can only have up to 4 fonts, so the &ldquo;Minion Pro&rdquo; family had to be broken into sub-families of up to 4 elements.
If you ask a Mac system, the font family will always be «Minion Pro», independently of how many elements the family is composed of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why MSNameID1 ≠ MacNameID1, for font families with more than 4 elements*. In these cases, two more Microsoft platform name strings are added to the fonts, MSNameID16 and MSNameID17, so that you get,
MacNameID1 = MSNameID16
MacNameID2 = MSNameID17</p>
<ul>
<li>MacNameID1 = MSNameID1 in one of the Windows sub-families</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>«What about fonts on the user’s system? Do we need to hardcode the path to those as well, in order to get access all the fonts in the family?»</em></p>
<p>CSS2 describes how to refer to locally installed fonts, e.g.:
<code>
  src: local(&ldquo;T-26 Typeka Mix&rdquo;), url(&ldquo;http://site/magda-extra&rdquo;) format(&ldquo;type-1&rdquo;)
</code></p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s no need for a path. But the spec doesn&rsquo;t say how to get the font name. I think it&rsquo;s fair to ask that the spec gives guidance on this, even if most implementations will go through system APIs to find the font. However, I&rsquo;m unsure what the spec should say, given that there are several fields with different strings in them. If the font community (that&rsquo;s you ;-) want guidance in the CSS spec, you need to agree on how to find the name of a font.</p>

All of Adobe’s fonts fit into the CSS model:</p>
<p><code>@font-face {</code>

<code>font-family: &ldquo;mythesis&rdquo; }</code></p>
<p><code>h1 { font-family: &ldquo;mythesis&rdquo; }</code></p>
<p>If we are thinking within the context of server side fonts/Prince, I think this setup is ideal. We don&rsquo;t have to be concerned about whether or not the target font is not on a user&rsquo;s system, because we&rsquo;re calling it from our own server.</p>
<p>Obviously it doesn&rsquo;t work if we&rsquo;re trying to spec a font that isn&rsquo;t on the end-user&rsquo;s system, but that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re dealing with here.</p>

<p>It should be easy if we&rsquo;re talking about Opentype fonts. Since each font isn&rsquo;t in a &ldquo;suitcase&rdquo; like they are in Truetype or Postscript,(.dfonts excepted), you could just call it by filename (blablabla-regular.otf), couldn&rsquo;t you?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Using filenames is not a good idea, because they are not necessarily static. If a font is something that is fairly frequently updated, e.g. a custom font for a publisher that is expanded with new glyphs to cover the typesetting needs of new books, then it isn&rsquo;t unusual for the font file name to include some kind of version or build reference.</p>
<p>As I understand the recent comments (thanks Thomas and Miguel for pointing out my misreading), the CSS notion of a font family is slightly larger than that of a Windows (non-WPF*) 4-font family, adding width to Windows' weight and slope. The OpenType family concept is essentially open-ended.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the subject of WPF, it seems to me that many of the issues we&rsquo;re talking about here with regard to font selection have already been given a lot of thought by Mikhail Leonov and David Brown, and their white paper on the <a href="blogs.msdn.com/text/attachment/2249036.ashx">WPF font selection model</a> (PDF download link) might be worth re-reading about now. The WPF concept of family seems to be pretty much identical to that of CSS, including weight, width and slope properties.</li>

You forgetting that we&rsquo;re controlling things server-side. We KNOW what the filename is. We don&rsquo;t have to guess. And if WE update the font, WE can update the link to the file, version or build reference included.</p>
<p>But I think that this requires two different sets of font specifications depending on intention. One for user-side font specification, like we currently have, and the new server-side specifications like has been discussed.</p>
