body: Hello all. I&#39;ve been searching for the font that is about 80% similiar to
  Harrington &#40; <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?1ND" target="_blank">http://www.identifont.com/show?1ND</a>
  &#41; but for the life of me I cannot find it. The differences are a straight backed
  lower case &#39;a&#39; &#40;among others&#41; and more of a dollop/spot end to the
  letters than Harringtons which are sharp curves. A post on this board has a pic,

  but harrington is not the correct font &#40;note the upper case Cs and the dollop
  tips&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks for any help in advance!

  body: Hey Mark, <BR> <BR>Yeah, the sample is in the second link in my post. The
    text that says &#34;The Skinny Cow&#34; is using the Harrington clone. That&#39;s
    what I&#39;m after. Thanks again for any help in figuring this one out &#40;I&#39;ve
    searched thousands of fonts by now with no luck <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: Have you seen this &#39;Harrington clone&#39; anywhere else? It looks to me
    like someone just squooshed Harrington using WordArt and then chopped off the
    C flourish.

  body: I was trying to say the same thing but my post ended up in cyberspace. I think
    that condensing the Harrington would also turn those sharp curves into dollops.

  body: It&#39;s definitely different. Here - check out this example. I&#39;m trying
    to duplicate this font for someone. This came from his logo which he does not
    have the source or contact info for. Note the lower case &#39;a&#39; and the dollops
    again. It&#39;s definitely not altered unless someone wanted to spend alot of
    time doing so for just this. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for the continued help!! <BR>
