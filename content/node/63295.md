  title=\"Typographic structure\">says Mark Boulton</a>:\r\n\r\n<strong style=\"color:rgb(85%,85%,85%)\">When
  I was in uni\xADver\xADsity, I sent off for every type spe\xADci\xADmen sheet I
  could get my hands on\u2026. Receiv\xADing the can\xADvas bags stuffed with font
  sup\xADple\xADments from T26 was cer\xADtainly a high\xADlight of my first year.
  Why? Well, firstly, type sup\xADple\xADments are nor\xADmally <em>beau\xADti\xADful
  things</em>. They didn\u2019t neces\xADsar\xADily make me look at type any dif\xADfer\xADently,
  but they made me want to <em>col\xADlect</em> type\u2026. [I]t\u2019s a mind\xADset
  that leads to a shal\xADlow under\xADstand\xADing of the broader craft. You get
  dis\xADtrac\xADted by the next beau\xADti\xADful typeface. You\u2019re con\xADstantly
  on the search for the typeface that is <em>just right</em>. Font choice is not the
  most import\xADant decision you make when design\xADing with type.</strong>"
