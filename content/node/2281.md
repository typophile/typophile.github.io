body: Hey, I was wondering if anybody knew how to create distressed/faded/word/grungy
  looking text on either photoshop and or illustrator.  I am doing a project for someone
  and I plan on having large and bold arial type, but I wanted it to be distressed
  and I was wondering how to go about it.  Suggestions are wanted, thanks much.

    then go to  <BR> <BR>Object &#62; Path &#62; Simplify <BR> <BR>Type in a value
    of 90-95 percent. This will <BR>strip your type of points and give it a more <BR>beat
    up look. <BR> <BR>Then also mix in <BR> <BR>Filter &#62; Distort &#62; Roughen
    <BR> <BR>size, 1 to 2 percent <BR>detail, 10 to 20 <BR> <BR>This will add more
    points. <BR> <BR>You can then go back to simplify. <BR> <BR>This will just affect
    the perimeter, however. <BR> <BR>To get inside, i use one of these templates below
    ... <BR> <BR>I made a bunch of them a couple of years ago. <BR> <BR>In Photoshop,
    select the black with the Magic Wand, then <BR>select Similar. Fill with White.
    <BR> <BR>Overlay the white distressed file on top of your black type.  <BR>Blur
    some. Then Flatten and go <BR> <BR>Mode &#62; Bitmap &#62; 50 percent threshold.
    <BR> <BR>Then back up to Grayscale, blur some more, <BR>maybe overlay the file
    again rotated differently, <BR>than back down to Bitmap, etc. etc. <BR> <BR>Also,
    you can mix in the airbrush tool on DISSOLVE setting. <BR> <BR>If these don&#39;t
    give you the effect you&#39;re after,  <BR>you can contact me offline. <BR> <BR>a
    not-so-professional tutorial but maybe it&#39;ll help. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: david, yes that poster was the result of an all night outing at non other
    than kinkos ;&#41; <BR> <BR>its really nice to get off the computer sometimes.
    I think for a distressed/weathered effect.. its really the only option. I cant
    stand type that was digitally altered to look like this. And you can tell right
    away. Seriously, it doesnt take all that much more time to do it right.

  body: I agree with David. <BR> <BR>The result is not only better, but creating it
    is fun!!! <BR>Photocopiers are a gift from heaven. If you have an older one it
    is even more fun. You hardly ever know what you are going to get. <BR>Paste it
    up by hand or assemble in Photoshop.
