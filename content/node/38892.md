  photography + typography\r\nan UPPERCASE project\r\n\r\nInternational artists are
  invited to explore typography in their surroundings by documenting what they see
  within one city block of where they live or work.\r\n\r\nParticipants can post their
  images in a Flickr pool for the online exhibition. UPPERCASE gallery owner, Janine
  Vangool, and photographer Kirstie Tweed (Orange Girl Photographs) will curate from
  these images to create a physical exhibition and companion book. The exhibition
  will be part of Exposure, the Banff-Calgary Month of Photography (February 2008).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/typeblock/\r\nhttp://www.uppercasegallery.ca"

    be extended to \"a mile or so down the road\" or \"the type nearest you?\" Or
    is this strictly an urban project?\r\n\r\n"

    typography you find in your immediate environment, however far you might have

    printing processes. But whether a letter is drawn as a single expression (hand-lettered
    shop sign), or cut out in vinyl, or designed for reproduction via mechanical or
    digital processes, aren't all these typography, the creation and setting of letterforms?

    or lettering found in the street. That's certainly what I was taught in school.

    general usage of the word \"typographic\" is loose, and that goes for many in
    the design business.\r\nHowever, dictionary definitions all say pretty much the
    same thing, that typography is made with type, not a paint brush.\r\nSure, lettering
    is a related art, and it may be convenient to call it typography, but it isn't.\r\nIt's
    not a big deal Justine, just Typophile nit-picking. So, er, Welcome!\r\n\r\nYes,
    \"text\" is slippery, but in the art world \"text art\" or \"text-based art\"
    refer to work with lettering or type as the main visual element. \r\n\r\nI don't
    know what the best solution is. It just seemed strange that an exhibition of what
    will probably comprise predominantly photos of hand-made, one-off lettering is
    being described as typography."

  body: "Type is mechanically repeatable, modular systems of letters meant to be combined
    infinitely.\r\n\r\nLettering is any letterforms made by hand. Lettering as an
    umbrella term could include:\r\nCalligraphy (defined as \"beautiful writing)\r\npenmanship\r\nhandwriting\r\nsignpainting\r\nlettercarving\r\nbrush
    lettering\r\n\r\nbut not type, or typography. Typography involves type; see above.
    Type is modular, lettering is handmade; one of a kind. You can reproduce lettering
    (screenprinted shirts, hotel logos), but it's still lettering, not typography.
    Type can be used with lettering, and both involve the alphabet and writing, but
    they still are not the same. It's like the difference between studio pottery and
    production ware, or custom/retail, or couture/rack. Handmade versus mechanical.
    Type gets designed by hand (sometimes), but then becomes mechanical when it's
    made into type.\r\n\r\nI do think the distinction is meaningful and important
    for designers to acknowledge; hand skills are dying out, and people are becoming
    oblivious to the way things get made. Everything is not photoshop, assemblage,
    appropriation and \"homage\". Some people create things directly with their hands.

    in Typophile. Maybe I don't have a thick enough skin for forums. \r\n\r\nSince
    a large portion of this thread has been about vocabulary, I will state that I
    take offense to the juvenile comments of referring to people as \"snottier-than-thou\"
    and references to people being \"anti-social\". I am trying to produce a professional
    project here. If you want to discuss the Type Block project, that's fine. If you
    want to name-call and insult, start your own thread. Almost anyone reading this
    thread would likely agree with me. \r\n\r\nI did not \"brag about making money\",
    Linda. What a rude thing to post for all to see. If you can figure out how to
    make money with this project, let me know, it would certainly be most welcome
    to hear. \r\n\r\nThis project is not a contest. There is no fee for people to
    participate. People choose to join or not and our intentions are clearly stated
    on the Flickr group. My gallery will cover the cost of printing and displaying
    the chosen images. The exhibition is part of a Banff-Calgary photography festival
    that is free to the public during the month of February. We haven't decided if
    the works will be for sale, and if they are, the prices will be determined by
    the artist with a small portion going to the gallery to recoup the printing and
    display costs.\r\n\r\nThe publication is a way of commemorating the project and
    will be a book published via Blurb or another print-on-demand source. Participants
    and the general public who are interested can order the book online and we'll
    have a few in the gallery that month. That's it. This definitely falls into the
    \"labour of love\" category.\r\n\r\nSo if you share a love for this project, we'd
    love to have you onboard and I'll see you on Flickr. It's a much friendlier place."
