  body: "They use <a href=\"http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_sterling/sterling.html\">Foundry
    Sterling</a> on their site. This logo might have been based on Foundry Sterling
    Book. If you modified the \u2018p\u2019, the \u2018d\u2019 and the \u2018a\u2019,
    you could make this logo. The \u2018p\u2019 might be a flipped \u2018b\u2019 and
    also the \u2018d\u2019 might be a reversed \u2018b\u2019. And the \u2018a\u2019
    might have been made with the \u2018d\u2019."
