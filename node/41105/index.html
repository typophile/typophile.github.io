  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Agamemnon began as an experiment I did on Fontographer years ago. I revived it over a year ago and began discussing it here on Typophile. [[http://typophile.com/node/28862|That original thread is here]], but has become long and unwieldy, potentially frightening off new critics trying to wade through the history of revisions. I&rsquo;ve since moved development of this font to FontForge. The ability to edit with Spiro curve technology has been invaluable!</p>
<p>The font could be categorized as transitional and slab serif. The serifs and horizontal strokes are cupped and curved, creating a visual texture that should maintain legibility at small sizes and great distances. The current weight, though, is a tad awkward; too heavy for a book weight, but not quite a bold.</p>
<p>Over time I have expanded the character set. Once started with a basic MacRoman, I have since expanded it to include most of the Unicode Latin codepages, as well as basic Cyrillic, Greek, and Cherokee, plus Latin small caps, tabular oldstyle figures, fractions, stylistic alternates, special Icelandic ligatures, and a whole lot of currency and miscellaneous symbols.</p>
<p>And the snark, uppercase eszet, ruble sign, <em>&amp; al.</em></p>
<p>The PDF files attached here are all development version numbered, beginning with version twenty-nine. Earlier revisions are documented in the original thread linked above. The most recent one will have the highest number. Files with the same number are different settings of the same version.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m concerned by the serifs on top of the w, v, and y, since they&rsquo;re different from those on the other letters, but I haven&rsquo;t come up with a better solution that maintains the peaked and cupped form.</p>
<p>Should the serifs on the Cyrillic miniscules match those of the majiscules or should they be similar to those of the Latin lower case, since now they&rsquo;re a mixture and I want to make them consistent. They&rsquo;re also the same height as the Latin lower case, and they look all right to me but I don&rsquo;t know how that works fro someone who can actually read the things.. I&rsquo;ve already found I had to go with something completely different for the Greek lower case with rounded top serifs.</p>

I know there is much to be done with the kerning. I can tackle that once I figure out what&rsquo;s making FontForge crash when I try it. 
I really need another pair of eyes to tell me if my bold is bold enough, or if my italic is, well, italic enough. Again, I ought to be able to tell for myself, but this really is my first attempt at a minimally complete family (pending the bold-italic and small cap sets), so I would greatly appreciate some nudges in the right direction.</div>

<p>You are quite right. Though the Unicode manual says that the interpunct in L· and l· is to be composed with the periodcentered character, that is a bit heavier than the dotaccent in this font. The umlaut dot may be even smaller. I&rsquo;ll try some variations and apply that which works best in the next revision. I&rsquo;d rather go with the opinion of someone expert in the relevant language than the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; in a book any day, but being familiar primarly with English I&rsquo;m pretty clueless with what to do with all these diacritics and I have to go by whatever information I can get.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eh, I&rsquo;m not expert in Catalán, I&rsquo;ve just seen some signs here and there.</p>
<p>Here are some samples of dots in a variety of fonts (quite a variety in fact).  Each line is lowercase U with umlaut, lowercase I, period, precomposed lowercase L with interpunct, a second lowercase L, and then a middle dot (used normally for inputting it).  I&rsquo;m generally of the line of thinking that the two Ls should be kerned normally just with a dot in between them.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/umlaut_i_period_catalan_double_l_interpunct_6001.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from a [[http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb16-3/tb48vali.pdf|detailed paper]] on the subject of Catalonian typographic conventions:</p>
<p><cite>The present proposal consists of deﬁning the character as a digraph formed by two letters, with a middle dot as diacritic mark. The middle dot has to be located between the two letters and equidistant from their stems. In order to facilitate reading, the middle dot has to be centered at half the height of uppercase letters. This is due to the fact that the digraph only appears between vowels. Moreover, between the two letters there has to be the same distance as there is between the two letters when they are not written with a middle dot, in order not to break continuity of words containing the digraph. There seems to be no deﬁnitive need for the middle dot to be smaller than a period, contrary to the proposal in Mestres (1990). Boldface fonts are the only ones out of 27 standard TEX fonts where a smaller middle dot would be, to the author’s taste, aesthetically more pleasant. As a matter of fact, most (if not all) old and modern printed representations of the digraph share the fact that the middle dot and the period have the same size. <cite></p>
<p>However, he&rsquo;s discussing exclusively TEX fonts, and admitingly not in the design field at all.  [[http://femfum.com/PDF/ElaGeminada/LletraDeConvitPerLaElaGeminada.pdf|This other fella]] presents far more background and I believe based on my rudimentary knowledge of Catalonian actually works as a designer.  I&rsquo;ll try to trudge through it more.</p>
<p>It may be of note that [[http://wwwa.urv.net/centres/Departaments/fcatalana/TipografiaDeQualitat.pdf|this paper]] which discusses the ideas of &ldquo;quality typography&rdquo; (and is a bit easier to read than the second article I mentioned) has a l·l with a dot significantly smaller than the period.  While he is a not a designer by trade, his article is quite well written and could easily be confused with a designer (of course, I might just be seeing a different guy with the same name on google, but who knows).</p>
<p>Also, while I like your bold and italic capital Q, the normal one seems just a little too&hellip;. Thai-like for me.<br>

It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that FontForge has an active development community that releases patches frequently with new features even almost monthly. Much better than waiting a decade for an OS compatibility patch that has prices starting at $99, but could vary depending on what version you have and what you want to upgrade to.</p>
<p>A software survey is probably better directed to the Build or General Discussions forums. I guess it would be interesting to see just how vast the majority is. I think there was a sort of a survey like that a while ago, but I don&rsquo;t think it quantified much.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Determining acceptable variation is going to be somewhat of an experimental process. As I mentioned in the other thread, knowing what reader&rsquo;s perceptions are likely to be is a guessing game until you can find someone familiar with reading and writing Cherokee that can provide the sort of feedback that will be helpful. In the development stage, its best to analyse what few examples are available, keeping in mind that there are very few that would constitute strong typographic tradition, so cues also should be taken from the hand drawn models as well. Keep in mind that using this methodology does not guarantee that users will like what you do, but it is at least a starting point—it may not let you know what &ldquo;the symbols are supposed to be&rdquo;, as we don&rsquo;t have much of an evolution of glyph form to draw from, so many of the finer details are up to the type designer. Some of the more core variations can be seen by looking at the various fonts, as there were some changes from the first (1827) to the second (1835) font and then various other mutilations occurred generally in the 20th century interpretations, most of which are not terribly instructive as to how things should look typographically, although they do inform expectations, as these are what people are used to in varying degrees. I think that handwritten examples may be more informative then many of the modern fonts.</p>
<p>A historical timeline such as the following is useful:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/E_chart_4746.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I think there is something to be said for at least thinking about how to separate some forms from their (apparent) Latin counterparts. The environment in which Cherokee is learned now is almost certainly different then it was 150+ years ago, and I imagine most all learners will already be literate in English and so will be biased as to glyph shape—probably less of a hurdle to overcome for young students then for older ones.
In the most basic approach, analyse &ldquo;shared&rdquo; forms: does the &ldquo;<em>i</em>&rdquo; need to look like the uppercase &ldquo;T&rdquo;? and what can be done to modify it away from that form while maintaining its legibility? Of course, the first metal types used an existing &ldquo;T&rdquo; (smallcap Didot) rather then contriving something new. Looking to Sequoyah&rsquo;s first for-print model, he drew several wedge-terminals as having open counters, which is a clue to one or two alternate approaches, as terminal treatments in Sequoyah&rsquo;s model actually have some semantic meaning, rather then just being stylistic goo-gahs.</p>
<p>FYI, the Plantagenet sample above is version 1 from several years ago—many of its deficiencies have been or are being addressed for version 2.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">That&rsquo;s the troublesome thing about the Cherokee symbols. Many, especially the ones apparently derived from the Latin alphabet, are virtually identical to each other, distinguished only by the style of the stroke terminals or some ornament feature (as seen from a Latin context). The most obvious error I made in that regard was placing hook terminals in many places where there should be balls. I did notice those triangular wedge serifs on some of the characters in Sequoyah’s model. I did exaggerate the serifs in my own font where they appeared, compared to similar Latin letters, but I may go even further, perhaps as much as the Cyrillic spike descenders (not shown in my current sample, but greatly enlarged in v31). I don&rsquo;t know about opening them, though; that might make too much visual clutter, at least at small sizes. Could be worthwhile to include in display weights, though.</div>

<p>Among things I&rsquo;ve said before, I&rsquo;m nearly ready to show another progress sample. I&rsquo;m having a problem getting some of the Greek characters to appear properly, notably Delta and mu. I think it&rsquo;s because they are both duplicated or referred to at other points in the Unicode space, and something with Mac OSX 10.4 isn&rsquo;t cooperating somehow.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Latin section is pretty firmly set apart from spacing issues and problems with stacked accents affecting the line height. The Cyrillic set is much improved from my previous version, but still limited to basic characters and may only be suitable for Russian right now. The Greek has significant changes which could make it at least legible, but I don&rsquo;t really know. It is quite literally all Greek to me. There are some big changes to the Cherokee too, in light of our recent conversations.</p>
<p>Also I&rsquo;ve made a quick and dirty light weight of the basic Latin characters, but that still needs tweaking.</p>
<p>Any preferences on who wants to see what first?</p>

<p>I had to make this shot larger than the one for the Cherokee since some details didn&rsquo;t show up smaller. I tried to maintain the vertical contrast that the other scripts in the font have, but I&rsquo;m afraid it has made some of the letters appear awkward. Rounding the serifs seems to have helped soften the lower case without creating too much disharmony, and radical redesigns from previous versions have improved legibility, but to what extent I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>There are only a few things that really stick out to me is that the Ω seems a bit thin compared to the other caps even though I could swear it has the same weight as the O.  Maybe make it a bit thicker.</p>
<p>I think you did a good job doing vertical contrast, I tried and failed several times to do that with greek.  Normally it makes for wider characters, but for Agamemnon, it fits perfectly.</p>
<p>The ω seems a little wide but that might just my eyes playing tricks on me, when I compare to φ or ψ it seems the same width.</p>
<p>What would your alternate θ look like?  It&rsquo;s generally a curlier design, and might go better with your font, the current one sticks out a bit as it looks too regular.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for pointing that out about omega. It actually measures the between the widths of phi and psi, but looks overly broad due to the shape. I never even knew theta is supposed to have an alternate form. So much research still to do (This is very foreign territory for me&ndash; I&rsquo;m more comfortable with Japanese.)</p>
<p>In the mean time, here is this:
<img src="/images/old-images/screenshot_0272_5395.png" alt="">
I made the spike descenders much larger and trapezoidal. This feature is also seen on some of the Cherokee symbols shown earlier. I also unified the serifs on the lowercase and narrowed some of the letters that were analogous in the Latin set. Still, I think the lowercase may be too short, so I could make them taller on the next run through.</p>
<p>Also included are my currency symbols. Try and name them all!</p>

Theta/kappa/pi/omega/rho have alternate versions either used as symbols or just differently prefered forms, the theta is open and looksl like cursive, the kappa looks more like an x sort of thing, the omega is closed, rho has an extra stroke, beta has no descender, etc.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s see, I can almost get &lsquo;em all without cheating, dollar cent pound generic yen florin shilling common-european, um, crona franc lira &hellip;&hellip; pesetas reais won dinar euro penny &hellip;. ruble&hellip;.</p>
<p>The cyrillic looks good.  I agree with the choice of darker descenders.  I wonder if maybe on л you might want to pull the left leg in a little bit.  Also, the accent on И seems a bit too far to the left.  Or actually that might just be the ` as it&rsquo;s pretty far on the left on the E too.</p>

<p>Yes, so it will be easy enough to restore those to their default states. I&rsquo;m just not always satisfied with the results of the auto-assembly. Stacked accents are especially a bother, as they distort the line height (at least until I correct the parameters). I tightened the line spacing to .7 to get them even this close together.</p>

I&rsquo;m a touch too broke to upgrade my software, so the only thing I have to  display the whole font without crashing on Character Pallette input is Text Edit.</p>
<p>As for its purpose, it&rsquo;s a bit too massive for an everyday text font, though it has features that should make it highly readable. It&rsquo;s a bit clunky with those wavy slabs.</p>
<p>There are not a lot of Cherokee fonts out there, as far as I can tell. Many of them are really poorly designed, like that &ldquo;official&rdquo; one I showed above, but are still considered usable by those who use them. In my opinion Plantagenet is the most thoughtful and best looking example of a Cherokee font I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but even Ross Mills concedes that it is deficient in its current form. I have done scarcely any research on the matter, in comparison, and I consider it high praise that anyone with even casual expertise commends my efforts.</p>

<p>I believe I mentioned that I&rsquo;m a teacher of our language and I&rsquo;ll be teaching two more classes starting next month. I teach Cherokee for the Cherokee Nation and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokees.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not sure what kind of expertise I have in the work that you are doing in creating fonts but I have been reading and writing in the language most of my life and I&rsquo;ve seen alot of different ways of making the symbols in the system. So what you are doing is okay by me. Though I&rsquo;m no spokesperson for either tribe. However, I am a sixth generation descendent of the original Sequoyah and I believe he would like what you are trying to do. Keep it up and let me know when you are ready to show it off a bit. I&rsquo;ll use it in my classes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Okay, I&rsquo;m sorry. The above post was my first reaction to the great work you&rsquo;re doing. But after I really pondered over your latest chart there are a couple of things that I should mention. Nothing great - just a few observations.</p>
<p>1 - the first symbol should be down at the last of your chart. (unless you did this for a purpose) It&rsquo;s part of the vowels.</p>
<p>2 - the &ldquo;doh&rdquo; symbol threw me for a second. It&rsquo;s downside up. I&rsquo;m cool with that but that leads me to the third thing.</p>
<p>3 - The Keetoowah and some elder Cherokees are very traditional and though I see nothing wrong with creating a font such as yours, some of the people will not go for it because it&rsquo;s so different (which is what I like about it). They are very weary of change. It usually takes a while for new things to catch on with them. However, at the same time, if they see the young people taking to it - the elders will let it slide because the younger generation is accepting it. One of the things that&rsquo;s going for your font is the fact that it looks gothic (sorry but I just had to say it - but hey! gothic Cherokee, cool). And our young people will like that.</p>
<p>Again, I like what you&rsquo;re doing. I&rsquo;d like to see it finished.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you, this is exactly the sort of advice I need. As a teacher of the language, you necessarily have a deeper technical understanding that even native speakers and writers may lack, so I certainly consider you to be an expert. I&rsquo;ll give more weight to your opinions than many other peoples research. On to your points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Indeed you are correct, and in checking my materials I understand why I did it like that and why you are right.
For some reason the V (shaped like &ldquo;i&rdquo;) appears first in Plantagenet Cherokee when entered from the character palette. In Agamemnon, it appears sixth on the character palette, which is still incorrect, but that is where it is in the Unicode sequence. At least it appears after A (D), E (R with hook), I (T), O (Ꭳ), and U (O with horn), which are all the open vowels without consonants, so they belong on the same row together. For some reason Unicode has them at the beginning, rather than the end, which you suggest is correct. A logical argument could be made to put them either at the beginning or the end, but I&rsquo;ll go with your advice on the customary position when I produce my next sample.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DO is &ldquo;V&rdquo; shaped in the official font, and I will adjust mine to reflect that in adherence with custom. I gave it the &ldquo;Λ&rdquo; shape because it appears that way both in the Plantagenet font and in this scan of an early sketch of the syllabary attributed to Sequoyah:
<img src="/images/old-images/Syllabary_6129.JPG" alt="">
But doesn&rsquo;t the V shape of DO sometimes lead to confusion with TSE?
I also noticed that the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shaped GO has a vertical stroke on the crossbar in this sample, not seen on other examples, but that is why I included it on mine.
I also expect my design of YI might be controversial. 
DE has confused me, since it is one of several &ldquo;S&rdquo; shaped symbols, which looks just mangled in the official font and is distinguished from DU only by a twisted serif and half a line across the middle. In my DE I tried to make that cross stroke suggest a reversal, as if a &ldquo;c&rdquo; were drawn above a reversed &ldquo;c&rdquo; in a single motion, rather than as an &ldquo;S&rdquo;. Does this sound reasonable to you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to say about this. In the scripts of most languages, there is a lot of room for stylistic variation and decoration, but it&rsquo;s generally an issue of aesthetic preference unless you go so far with the design as to get something actually &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;. With the CWY it&rsquo;s hard to tell what right and wrong even is, so I appreciate the assistance you&rsquo;ve given me and any more you give in the future. The only connection I have with the language is that my parents went to Sequoia High School in Redwood City, CA, and the place was most likely named after the tree.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m always cautious using the term &ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; around here. It has at least two nearly opposite meanings in typography which have little to do with the architecture, fashion/lifestyle trends, or Germanic tribes sharing that name.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree that gothic was a wrong choice of words. I should have said it looked &ldquo;arcane&rdquo;. Anyway, my point is this: the font you&rsquo;ve developed has a progressive look that is not only a feast for the eye but it will help promote the learning of the language in general. If a writing system is to exist in fifty, a hundred years - it will have to evolve just as the spoken language has to change.</p>
<p>I would say keep the DO just as you have it. Although it threw me for a couple of seconds, it is (as you pointed out) how it is in the earlier chart.</p>
<p>In an earlier post, I mentioned that I&rsquo;ve read many, many examples of the hand written language. And during these readings, you would be amazed at how creative the elders were with some of the symbols by putting their own little creative twists to them. I remember watching my father practice his hand writing and when he was finished - the end results were almost calligraphic. Folks would comment about how pretty his writing was.</p>
<p>Again, my point is this:  Finish your font. It&rsquo;s different and fresh. I, for one (and again, I&rsquo;m no spokesperson for either tribe), am not so closed minded or afraid of change that I would want to stick with the same old tired &ldquo;Offical&rdquo; font. I would use your font, if nothing else than just to be different. It&rsquo;s useable and readable.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Although the YI might be confused with O, it&rsquo;s still different. But this is one of the things I like about your font.</p>
<p>Ga, De and Du are always confusing to the novice. But after they really start getting into it they begin to tell the difference between the three.</p>
<p>So, Quo and Yi are the only ones that might be thought of as really different but I don&rsquo;t believe it will cause that much trouble.</p>
<p>As I said, they are all readable. I can hardly wait until you deem your font finished.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing about me that you should probably know. I&rsquo;m sort of a maverick in teaching our language. You would think that people around here would all know how to speak in our own language, but such is not the case. All three tribes are scrambling to teach the language to the younger generation, hence the language classes sponsered by the tribes. But where other classes teach reading and writing right off - I&rsquo;ve always believed that the folks needed to speak first. So that&rsquo;s what I begin with. I teach my students how to say words and phrases first before I get them into reading and writing. I don&rsquo;t believe other classes do this. They go straight into reading and writing. So in this matter, I&rsquo;m&hellip; kinda different from other teachers of our language. Which might explain why I look forward to your release of your font. I believe the new look will spark a desire in the youth to learn how to use the syllabary and ultimately learn their own language.</p>

<p>There are obsolete IPA glyphs too (glyphs that have now been replaced by different forms, especially at Kiel 1989) and I think they are in Unicode for backward compatibility with prior 8-bit encodings. They should probably be included in any font that has the IPA, though, because it may be necessary to set documents created using earlier versions of the IPA.</p>

<p>The trick for IPA is making sure that you leave combining mark information for every single glyph that can be used in IPA.  (I&rsquo;m going overboard at the moment with Coruña and including top, bottom, top-right, overlay, and cedilla marks for EVERY SINGLE alphabetic character and most symbols haha, but that&rsquo;s abnormal).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to get myself a nice document with lots of close IPA transcription that will include the potential double or triple diacritics on some of the letters (oh yes, I forgot, you need combining marks on your combining marks :) )</p>

<p>I think you should lower the glyphs with the bended lower serifs. If you put those – for example, lc l — and a circular glyph (which needs to overshoot), then word would look really odd. Maybe try putting the apex of the arc of the bended lower serif at the baseline and let its serifs overshoot?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>All righty! Finally some progress. [[http://typophile.com/files/agamemnon36-12ptsample.pdf|&ldquo;agamemnon36-12ptsample.pdf&rdquo;]] is up on top. The character set is entered in the order they appear in Unicode. I included excerpts from Wikipedia in the four major scripts as well as a section in Anglo-Saxon to draw out some of the more exotic Latin characters. This is set at 12pt with normal line spacing. It seems I&rsquo;ve tackled the growth factor that the stacked accents brought in. Somewhere along the line the alignment of some accents shifted. That needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>I made some significant changes in the Cherokee glyphs, some of which are sure to be controversial, and I am open to changing them back if that&rsquo;s what the language requires.</p>
<p>I did notice a strange phenomenon when entering the combining accents one after another; they stacked on top of each other, creating a bit of a smear through the line above them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It has come to my attention that there is a free font being circulated by the name of PR Agamemnon by Peter Rempel. Since he brought it out to the public before I did, I won&rsquo;t dispute his claim to the name, not that anyone could claim a historic figure as a trademark anyway. Still, that leaves me with finding a new name for this thing. Any suggestions?</div>
