body: Just wondering what the general rules/guidelines are when using ligatures? <BR>
  <BR>Can they be used for headlines or should they be limited for use in body copy
  only? ie. below 12pt. <BR> <BR>Is there a general rule that they should not be used
  over a certain point size?

  body: There is no general size limit on ligatures, no. What gave you the idea that
    there was? <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re using a typeface that is designed specifically
    for text sizes, you might be inclined to track it more tightly at larger display
    sizes. In such a situation, the spacing of the ligature might start to look oddly
    loose next to the rest of the spacing. In such a situation, you might need to
    break apart the ligature. &#40;An app such as Adobe InDesign will do this itself
    automatically, assuming the ligature was formed automatically in the first place.&#41;
    Personally, if I found this necessary, I&#39;d make sure that the typeface wasn&#39;t
    getting nasty collisions as a result. <BR> <BR>There are plenty of typefaces with
    optical size variants or otherwise designed for display sizes, which have ligatures.
    This includes many or most of the Adobe Originals, for instance. <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>T
