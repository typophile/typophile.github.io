body: "(REPOSTED FROM THE DESIGN FORUM)\r\n\r\nHello all - Hope people are well on
  this sunny day (if it is in fact sunny where you are)....\r\n\r\nBelow are two screengrabs
  of my new portfolio site. 1)The two irregular black slabs in the corner are 'test'
  buttons....ignore them, they'll be replaced with the thumbnails for each section.
  2)The site is fairly heavily animated, so bare that it mind.\r\n\r\nThe structure
  for the site is pretty much there, but I'm having a nightmare deciding on how to
  display my work. I produce a mixture of canvases, photography and custom shoe work....I
  need something appealing, commercially tangible, and fairly subtle. So far I've
  stuck on using speech bubbles to contain my pics - they fit in with the semi-comic
  book style I've created for the site, which also mimics my canvases.\r\n\r\nMY QUESTIONS:\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nIs
  the speech bubble idea really awful?\r\n\r\nAny other alternatives you can think
  of? (eg. Scrolling rectangular boxes that obscure the background and display the
  pics ontop of those)\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAny ideas
  would be a huge help - I'm stuck at this hurdle and need to get this finished.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks :)\r\n\r\nP\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sitepic1.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/sitepic2.jpg]"

    to suit a comic book feel, not so keen on the zigzag \u2013 it seems a bit shouty,
    or the heavy drop shadow, I would also like to see the image filling the bubble.
    Does your other work suit this style? How are you going to navigate to the next
    pair? Will you reshape the bubble to suit each item?\r\nTim"

    body: "Hiya Tim,\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply....\r\n\r\nI'm playing with different
      'stems' for the bubble - the zigzag is a bit 'naff' as my girlfriend put it.\r\n\r\nBubbles
      will be reshaped for each item. This is fairly time consuming but I really don't
      want to rely on a straight slideshow image style. In terms of navigating bewteen
      pics, it's likely to involve closing the bubble and purely using thumbnails
      (which may get annoying for the viewer), or else fwd and prev buttons somewhere
      on the page - only problem with that is that speech bubbles seem to 'come from
      somewhere' direction-wise....Randomly loading up different speech bubbles with
      a fwd & prev buttons seems a bit dis-jointed, does that make sense?\r\n\r\nThe
      main thing is that the concept seems ok. I've actually added some white in&outlines
      to the bubble which seems to soften the drop shadow.\r\nI'll give it a go without
      it though. Thanks dude :)"

  body: "MekOne,\r\n\r\nThe speech bubbles really do go well with the comic book feel,
    but they are certainly not subtle -- at least not with the heavy drop shadow and
    lightning bolt coming out if the bottom. It may help to just soften the blow of
    the speech bubble some how.\r\n\r\n*Just and idea* - how about thought bubbles
    instead?\r\n\r\nDuncan\r\n"

  body: "lol\r\n\r\nYeah - I guess subtle isn't really the overall feeling is it.....\r\nI
    tried thought bubbles, but the unconnected 'o's for the stems were messy...The
    speech bubbles alpha tween in (fade in for none flash users) so they appear softened
    marginally - Switching to charcoal grey instead of black for the shadows might
    help too....I'll post up my 'smaller stemmed' 'recoloured' bubbles in a bit. \r\n\r\nThanks
    for the thoughts so far, really appreciate it :)"
