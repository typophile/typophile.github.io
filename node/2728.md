body: I&#39;m looking for some dingbats that would contain silhouettes of a chicken
  and/or a rooster. I&#39;ve done some digging today, but no luck. Can anyone point
  me to a font that would match this description? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Dylan

    target="_blank">Chicken</a>.

    I have it on good authority it was the rooster! <BR> <BR>

  body: I know this is late, but I believe Golden Cockeral has a few nice chicken
    dingbats/silhouettes in it. <BR> <BR>My favorite chicken anecdote is based on
    a song by Paul Simon of Simon and Garfunkel called &#34;Mother and Child Reunion&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Apparently there is a menu item on most Chinese restaurants of the same
    name and is basically a chicken breast served with eggs. Kinda morbid but consider
    yourself enlightened :D <BR> <BR>Stuart :D
