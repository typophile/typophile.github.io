  body: "The resolution of your sample is low, but it looks like <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-1&ffam=Gunplay%20-%20Regular&fid=692364a9599a246f0d083f865096ab52&fsize=60&text=Before%20its%20too%20late%20wwf.org&wrap=2|Gunplay]]</strong>
    stencil font by Ray Larabie\r\nThe regular weight is free to use and if you make
    it a bit bolder the stencil gaps will disappear."
