body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C cupcake_6310.jpg]\r\nApologies for the
  low resolution of this image. focus on the upper portion of the logo, thank you.\r\n\r\nSo
  here I am having a client for my final output for a course in my university and
  we agreed on the rebranding of the logo as being like this image up here.\r\n\r\nmy
  problem now is what \"C\" can be best similar to this? (See the center of the top
  portion of the logo.)\r\n- has a ball terminal\r\n- more or less constant width
  throughout the stroke of the \"C\"\r\n\r\nI am trying to have the look that the
  \"C\" that will be used in this logo will be the one that will be used for the brand
  name as well (since it also starts with C; both words to be exact.)\r\n\r\nIn addition,
  I'd need a second type that will accompany the primary type (for touchpoints and
  other deliverables)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions, opinions or comments about this? Much
  appreciated and thank you for your time! (in advance of course ^.^ )"

  body: "A couple of points:\r\n\r\n1. If you're just looking or the C in the logo,
    then why use a font? This should be easy enough to draw, and the advantages are
    that you get exactly what you want (what both you and the client envision), you
    don't have to worry about licensing/usage restrictions, and it costs nothing except
    your time which you would have to invest anyway.\r\n\r\n2. The fonts being free
    or not should make no difference whether the business is an established, ongoing
    concern, or with regards to usage. Often the commercial fonts will have fewer
    restrictions than many free fonts and you can be certain of your and your client's
    rights. With a commercial font you'll usually get a high quality design which
    is more likely  to be unique - and a commercial font doesn't need to break the
    bank. Many excellent fonts to be had for under a tenner.\r\n\r\nThat having been
    said. It is difficult to suggest a font without knowing anything of the client
    - the business, the target market, the usage of the logo and other branding material.
    All of this will inform your choice regarding the mood you wish to convey and
    the appropriateness of the font.\r\n\r\nFor the C and brand name style you've
    mentioned - a good typewriter font such as ITC American Typewriter, or Esfera
    from Nick Curtis (only $12.95) will give you the monoline character with ball
    serif. There are many great examples of complete branding solutions using fonts
    such as this also, so you may not need to look for a second font. However, if
    this is a cupcake business (kind of looks like a cupcake in the logo), then American
    Typewriter is probably a bit overused in this area and you may wish to consider
    an alternate style to set your client's business apart from the competition."

  body: "I see your points and I can agree much with all of what you said.\r\n\r\nif
    anything about the client:\r\n- rebranding to make the look less of a passion
    kind of business\r\n- cleaner look\r\n- yes it's a pastery business, online at
    that.\r\n- target market; younger demographic of people (think university students
    or people who can come by to get a treat for their loved ones on the go)\r\n-
    uses of logo would be for online and other touchpoints such as packaging, menu,
    posters\r\n\r\nas for mood, as my professor suggested, would be more to being
    a cleaner kind of logo rather than being elegant, simple or 'elitist' (as said
    by the client)\r\n"

  body: Clean style or not, I would simply design the C yourself. Reading your post
    I was already thinking "Why would you want a typeface for this?" and then I read
    osamu's post in which he makes a lot of valid points. I personally really wouldn't
    recommend typewriter typefaces for this brand though. I would design the C myself
    and possibly select a slab serif typeface to work with the logo for display use
    and/or body copy. Perhaps [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hoftype/cassia/|Cassia]]
    by Hoftype? It's not monoline, but I personally think your brand could use a "human
    touch". If you insist on monoline, then [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/archer/overview/|Archer]]
    by Hoefler & Frere-Jones should be a great choice.

    <a href=\"http://ernestinefont.com\">Ernestine</a> (disclaimer, the latter is
    mine). Both not free. But then, branding with free typefaces is usually a terrible
    idea \u2013 not just because many of them are not that great, but also because
    one of the points is to make your brand stand apart \u2013 which a typeface available
    to everyone at the touch of a button doesn\u2019t exactly help. \r\nIn this regard,
    drawing it yourself is of course the best idea. But since you\u2019ll want it
    to mesh with your type choice I\u2019d recommend to decide on the type first and
    then build on that."

  body: A comment about the logo itself. I realize it's just a rough sketch, but is
    the final going to be a line drawing? If so, be sure the lines are heavy enough
    to hold up well in small sizes (like a tiny web ad or in a small size on a business
    card).

  body: "well, taking all of what you guys & gals said, I see why it's better to do
    it myself (was not satisfied with how it came out (being vectored well and then
    the whip coming off as free hand (-_ - \" ) .)\r\n\r\nThe fonts said here, I'll
    try them all out to find what feels appropriate. With all the comments, it seems
    that all of you seem to say that I should just use 1 family type, is that correct?
    I still do need to compliment it with another typeface as a requirement in the
    course, but I do see that two different weights of the same family works as well."

  body: You don't necessarily need 1 typeface. I usually think 2 typefaces is the
    better option. It's just that we've been focusing on your current problem, which
    is to identify a typeface which can work well for your logo or will work as a
    basis for your logo. If you want advise on a complimentary typeface I think we
    need to have a better idea of which direction you're headed. I think I would first
    finish the logo and then find a secondary typeface.
