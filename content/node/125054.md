    body: Not too many people know that Typophile is back up and running. No emailing
      has been sent out to existing users. Would be nice if it was. I stumbled across
      it coincidentally as I was checking for status from time to time.

    We've relied purely on social media to get the word out this time around. Felt
    like the modern-type thing to do :)"
