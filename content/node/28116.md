body: "Okey, I'm creating a logo for a research project of mine. It can be described
  as <em>a xml-based markup standard for defining graphical user interfaces</em>.
  The technology name/acronym is XUG, which means, roughly, \"XML Graphical User Interface
  Language for Games\". It's kinda like HTML, but for game interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe
  general idea is that I wanted something that looks simple and modular. It's not
  a commercial project, and not something for large database applications, so I don't
  want anything bussiness-like - it has to be a bit fresh.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xug_logo_5311.png]\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n<em></em>\r\nThe
  use of red/green/blue is kinda obvious, since it's a technology for defining the
  appearance of stuff on screen.\r\n\r\nThe glyphs are meant to be very simplistic
  and, again, very modular. The \"G\" is meant to look like an arrow circling - one
  of the main features of the technology is the ability to have animations/transitions
  done easily, so I wanted to give a little hint of that on the logo.\r\n\r\nIs it
  too clich\xE9? I know these blocks around the letters is probably overused, but
  I can't remember of any similar logo right now. Can anyone remember a good example
  that will force me to change that?\r\n\r\nAnd what do you guys think overall - does
  it have too much space between the blocks? Are  the glyphs too heavy?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: If you went with a little less rounded forms, you could probably articulate
    the arrow in the G to greater degree.

  body: "It maybe a little cliched but i generally like it and think it's very appropriate,
    though it does look a bit too child-like at the moment.\r\n\r\nI would...\r\n\r\nget
    rid of the blocks\r\nhave the 3 letters in the 3 colours\r\nmake the 3 colours
    a bit less primary\r\nhave the 3 letters just touching\r\nmake the ends of the
    strokes only 50% rounded\r\nmake the arrowhead not quite so rounded\r\nlower the
    curve of the U and enlarge the arc of the G a little so they look as big as the
    X\r\n\r\nI don't know exactly what it will look like if you do all that. Quite
    possibly worse :)\r\n"

  body: "I like it. Fresh colors, simple yet sturdy, and I get the modularity thing
    you mentioned.\r\n\r\nMaybe the blocks could be more close, I think it's a little
    too wide now. And the G is too thick; the arrow tends to 'dissappear' now."

  body: "Good strong idea, agree with the others that the letters probably need to
    be slightly less thick so you can make the arrow on the \"G\" clearer. Like the
    symbolism of it, it's appropriate yet rather subtle. Love the simplicity.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    tweak the colors around a bit, try making them less saturated or try a couple
    of different color schemes, perhaps even different shades of the same color."

  body: "I like it.\r\n\r\nThough I agree with Jon that I would expect to see this
    logo in a toy store or on baby-care products. It's got huge child-appeal (or,
    parents of young children-appeal?)\r\n\r\nI like the colours. Given your explanation,
    they make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nI agree with Tiff about the 'roundness'.\r\n\r\nI
    think it's a good logo. But I would love to see what Jon's tweaks do to it. Mostly
    out of curiousity.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, guys. Good suggestions so far; it all makes sense and I'll review
    it based on these accounts.\r\n\r\nThe child-like appearance was bugging me too;
    it's good to see it's not just me. I think I'll still go with R/G/B, but tweak
    it a bit to make it less saturated - just a bit more serious.\r\n\r\nSpacing and
    positioning has to be tweaked too. Funny that some stuff started to bug me just
    because it was mentioned and I wasn't seeing it before. :)\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
