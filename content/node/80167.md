  recommend me a typeface similar to Life with more weights, I would be very thankful.\r\nI
  especially like the Q & J from Life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img>http://www.identifont.com/samples/urw/Life.gif</img>\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards."

    of weights and is more attractive than Life, IMHO.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/lido-stf/"
