  body: "What you need to do is set up kerning classes. Open the Classes panel, click
    on the \"+\" pop-up menu in the lower left-hand corner, and choose \"New Kerning
    Class\". This will create a new kerning class with a dummy name such as \"_kern1\".
    \r\n\r\nIn field at the the lower right, change the name to something more meaningful
    to you such as \"_A\", but make sure it starts with an underscore or it won't
    be processed properly. (The underscore indicates that it's a kerning class, not
    some other kind of class.)\r\n\r\nYou set up the class by indicating a key glyph
    (\"A\" for example) by adding a tick mark (apostrophe) after, and then list the
    names of the glyphs with which you intend to have the same kerning (\"a\" for
    your case). In your case, it should look like this:\r\n\r\n<code>_A: A' a</code>\r\n\r\nA
    more complete one would look more like this:\r\n\r\n<code>_A: A' Aacute Agrave
    Acircumflex Adieresis Aring Atilde a aacute agrave acircumflex adieresis aring
    atilde</code>\r\n\r\nWhen it looks the way you want, click on the \"Accept\" button
    (very important--if you don't, whatever you typed in will be lost). The glyphs
    you chose will populate the field at the upper right of the panel. If you've mistyped
    a glyph name, it will simply not show up, so it's a good idea to compare the two
    fields.\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to tell FontLab whether this class applies to
    when these glyphs are on the right or left or both sides of other glyphs. You
    do this by checking the little boxes to the right of the class name in the list
    at the top left. The dot in the center indicates the glyph that this class is
    sitting next to in a string of text. If this class should only apply when it's
    glyphs are the <em>left</em> side of a kerning pair, then click the left check
    box, or right box for the right side of a pair.\r\n\r\nAfter you set up your kerning
    classes, FontLab will automatically apply kerning to all members of class based
    on the kerning you apply to the key member in the Metrics window. If you choose
    \"Class Kerning\" from the \"Options\" pop-up menu at the bottom of the Metrics
    window, any kerning you apply to any member of a class will be applied to the
    key glyph, instead of to the member glyph.\r\n\r\nI hardly ever use the Kerning
    Assistance dialog, except to update the kern OpenType feature based on the current
    kern table. The Kerning Assistance dialog allows you to do some of the same things
    you can do in the Classes panel, but I find it to be less handy.\r\n\r\nThe manual
    goes into all this stuff in more detail."

  body: "The only reason why I can see anyone wanting to duplicate uppercase/lowercase
    kerning is if you were creating an all-caps face with the glyphs duplicated in
    the lowercase position.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, I'd think it would be easiest to
    simply create the uppercase characters and assign each of them two code points
    (e.g. assign A to both 0x0041 and 0x0061). I've read a number of times that doing
    things this way is actually a bad idea, but I've never really seen a satisfactory
    explanation as to why its a bad idea. I was wondering if anyone could enlighten
    me on this.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Andr\xE9, \r\n\r\nIn Type 1 fonts, you have to duplicate the glyphs as Unicode
    codepoints are not used at all. \r\n\r\nIn OpenType PS (.otf), there are quite
    a few situations where applications rely on glyph names rather than on Unicode
    codepoints. In some PDF creation scenarios where OpenType PS (.otf) fonts get
    converted to Type 1 fonts. In such scenarios, the original Unicode character strings
    of the text are lost, and also the glyph-to-Unicode information (the \"cmap\"
    table) is lost. The only carrier of text information are the glyphnames associated
    with the glyph stream. Tools such as Acrobat use that information to reconstruct
    the original character string, which is necessary for operations such as Find
    or Copy-Paste. Note that more \"intelligent\" PDF creation engines may include
    additional resources in the PDF file that store the original Unicode text.\r\n\r\nIn
    OpenType TT (.ttf) fonts, the approach with not duplicating the glyphs but assigning
    multiple Unicode codepoints is fine. \r\n\r\nA."

    here is what I'd do. (I use Vedit, but I'd bet Edit Pad Pro can do the same thing.)\r\n\r\nKern
    the caps. Be sure the lower-case letters are in the .vfb, but don't bother to

  body: "That's a clever solution, Charles, but assumes that the kerning is finalized.
    Class kerning has more set up, but once it's done, it gives you a lot of flexibility
    in the kerning process.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Adam: I just thought of a feature you
    should add to FontLab that would make setting up classes even easier. How about
    a command for making a new class based on glyphs selected in the Font window?
    You select a bunch of glyphs, choose \"New Class...\" from, say, the Glyph menu.
    A dialog appears with the glyphs displayed, a text field for the class name, a
    pop-up to choose the kind of class. For kerning classes, it would have some way
    to select the left/right of pair option and which one is the key glyph. Maybe
    you just drag it to the beginning of the glyph list.\r\n\r\nOr, maybe you could
    enhance the current Kerning Assistance dialog by having it use whichever glyphs
    are selected in the Font window as the basis when you click on the little \"New\"
    button to create a new kerning class?\r\n"

    or \u201Cuni1EA1\u201D. </cite>\r\n\r\nWell, of course uni0137 already is lower
    case (the lower case of uni0136) . . .\r\n\r\nBut I take your point, this only
    works where glyph names are the old \"AGL-type names\" -- as with the old Type
    1 fonts.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nMark, I don't use FontLab class-based kerning much
    because I have yet to figure out how to make all the needed exceptions work --
    for example, all the \"f + any-vowel-with-an-accent (other than acute)\" has to
    be an exception, as do F, K, P, T, V, W, and Y followed by an accented vowel.
    Then there are the acute-accented vowels followed by a quoteright (single or double)
    or parenright or bracketright, and on & on.\r\n\r\nWhen I do use class kerning
    with exceptions, I assemble everything in a text editor & import it back in. I
    can't make things work right in FL. No doubt just my ignorance."
