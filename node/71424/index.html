  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>HI all,</p>
<p>I could really use some advice, as I&rsquo;m driving myself nuts worrying about this. So any input would be very, very much appreciated :)</p>
<p>Long story short - I was working on a large design job for a publication over the last year. During the project I tried out several different typefaces, and finally the client and I settled on the DIN Condensed family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure where I got the fonts from in the first place, but I was using them. I then planned to purchase the font license before the project went to print. i.e. I&rsquo;m trying to be completely legit.</p>
<p>The problem is, now that all of the work is done I can&rsquo;t actually find where I can purchase EXACT version of DIN Condensed that I&rsquo;ve been using.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realise there would be any difference between versions, so I went ahead and bought FF DIN Condensed OT. I then removed the version I had been using, but found that inDesign didn&rsquo;t recognise it as the same font!</p>
<p>The original font files had names like &lsquo;FF DINCond-Bold&rsquo; and &lsquo;FF DINCond-Medium&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The new ones that I&rsquo;ve purchased have names like &lsquo;DINOT-Cond.otf&rsquo; etc&hellip;</p>
<p>So my questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does anybody know where I can purchase those fonts? And do I even need to seeing as I have a license...?</li>
<li>I find it quite confusing, as there seems to be dozens of versions of DIN alone... How can you tell exactly which version a font is before you buy? 
<li>I've since found versions of all of the DIN Condensed fonts available for download on the free fonts website [name removed by moderator] - does this mean I didn't need to purchase the fonts at all? i.e. they are public domain, as the website says...</li>
</ul>
Apologies for all the questions. I could just really use some advice (worrying myself sick that I've screwed up! 
Thanks a million.
<p>Cheers
Dee</p>
<p>P.s. by all means tell me if I&rsquo;m worrying about nothing!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dee, sounds like the fonts you originally used were Postscript versions, and you purchased Opentype versions. They should be essentially the same, and you would merely go to &ldquo;Find Font&rdquo; in InDesign and replace the Postscript version with the Opentype versions.</p>
<p>The website you mentioned is illegally posting fonts. I checked it out, and they are hosting and allowing free downloads of fonts that are owned by major type foundries. They may have some public domain fonts on there, but I would steer clear of that site.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>HI Chris,</p>
<p>Thanks - I really appreciate the input.</p>
<p>Yeah I think you might  be right that the original font was a Postscript version. The problem is the project has already gone to print, and I want to make sure I have a valid license for the finished product.</p>
<p>Also, the product is a textbook, and it includes a CDROM-based PDF of additional content, which also uses the same fonts as the print. So I worry that it is &lsquo;out there&rsquo; but not properly licensed.</p>
<p>Do you think I still need to purchase the Postcript version to be fully covered? Or would my Opentype license cover me&hellip;?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thrilled at the additional expense, but I&rsquo;d rather be on the level. The only thing is I can&rsquo;t seem to find the Postscript version anywhere, and even when I think I&rsquo;ve found it I&rsquo;m never 100% it&rsquo;s the right one - I don&rsquo;t fancy spending another $300 only to find out it&rsquo;s a slightly different version ;)</p>
<p>Thanks again,
Dee</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea. I think I&rsquo;ll just give FontShop a call. I&rsquo;m a tiny bit worried that they&rsquo;ll be unimpressed that I managed to get hold of the fonts in the first place - I genuinely don&rsquo;t know where I got them. Probably picked them up in design college..</p>
<p>Hopefully they&rsquo;ll understand the situation.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your advice

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Stephen.</p>
<p>Truth is I&rsquo;m not really sure where I got them. I&rsquo;ve seen DIN online on free font sites, so for a long time I just assumed it was a free font. It wasn&rsquo;t until I looked into it that I realised otherwise.</p>
<p>Do you know if my DIN OT license covers the Postscript version?</p>
