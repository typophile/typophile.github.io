  body: "There are three different H's in the lettering, but I agree with Lex that
    it has a Chank <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/uncle-stinky/\">'Uncle
    Stinky'</a> feel, only in slab form. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/mister-frisky/\">'Mr
    Frisky'</a> is a related font, that could be seen as an alternate form of the
    same design.\r\n\r\nI too think it's custom, but the Chank fonts might be another
    starting point, at least for the upper case.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
