  gone now, although there are other videos with the same (very nice) music. But the
  typeface in which the album cover is set is a very Latinized form of Greek; the
  alpha and zeta, for example, are replaced by Latin letters. The epsilon, however,
  retains a minimum of distinctive Greek elements to remain recognizable."

    part of the geometric sans innovation, introduced into both Latin and Greek typography
    c.1930. And the zeta is a capital, as is the Rho."
