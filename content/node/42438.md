  body: "Luckily, this usage of \"logos\" has nothing to do with graphic design, or
    it would be a bit ironic looking at their nondescript unmemorable name above the
    entry. Almost as ironic as their Southwest-style building surrounded by huge mounds
    of snow.\r\n\r\nFor anyone wondering what this means, \"logos\" is the same word
    in ancient Greek that forms the root of \"logic.\" It means symbol, word, knowledge,
    etc. Hellenistic thought was very influential on the early Christians, above all
    the writings of Paul."

  body: "Logo, also as in logotype - A whole word on one piece of type. \r\n\r\nThe
    unmemorable name is also off centre.\r\n\r\nfurther to the irony of the Southwest-in-the-snow,/Romanesque/Industrial
    Park-style, it's a church with services in two languages: Mandarin and Cantonese,
    so the Greek reference in the name is probably innocent of the connotations that
    people like me can't escape. :-)\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    in there.\r\n\r\n(Maybe other people actually knew what this is, but I didn't
    until I was looking up \"font\" in my English-Chinese dictionary a few weeks ago.)"
