  was asked: \r\n<cite>Has there ever been a font that has been marketed aggressively
  to the mainstream? That is, not only to the niche market of typographers and print

    \u2014i.e. bundled with Microsoft products, free. That is why Comic Sans has become
    a meme, and Impact too, LOLcats style.\r\n\r\nIt might also be said that Adobe
    products such as Illustrator and Photoshop are not really graphics niche products\u2014Adobe
    claimed to have increased the number of graphic artists x25 (in Pamela Pfiffner\u2019s
    book)\u2014and those products came on CD with a bunch of free fonts."

    of \"aggressive marketing\" of fonts would have to come from. I don't imagine
    a type distributor or major foundry would be putting that kind of energy and resources
    into promoting a specific font or group of fonts other than the obvious move of
    pushing their best sellers to the front. \r\n\r\nWhat I do see a more of these
    days is really, really deep discounts, which is kind of the opposite. A race to
    the bottom."

  body: "\"With TV commercials and the like?\"\r\n\r\nMy guess is that most folks
    who purchase fonts are professionals (graphic designers, etc) so TV advertising
    wouldn't make sense. Targeted advertising in design magazines and websites would
    be more logical, and maybe some web ads at popular computer sites.\r\n\r\nGoogle
    Fonts might be an exception, but I don't recall seeing ads for them.\r\n\r\nI
    think most folks would regard fonts bundled with an application as a bonus, not
    the main reason to purchase an application."

  body: "I would have interpreted the question as being \"was there ever a <em>typeface</em>
    that was aggressively marketed\"... and so the bundling of True Type fonts with
    either the Macintosh OS or with Microsoft Windows would not een have entered my
    mind.\r\n\r\nI certainly don't recall ever seeing TV commercials for Helvetica
    or Times Roman, and so I would say that the answer is \"no\".\r\n\r\nEven though
    one could consider bundling Arial as aggressively marketing the typeface as well
    as the font, and then there are all the Google fonts, or the Gandhi font family
    as another example.\r\n\r\nBut a case where the general public has been approached
    with a view to making money off the typeface afterwards... I can't think of one.\r\n\r\nBut
    then, I may not be recognizing all the possible forms that the marketing of a
    typeface might take. (I know I haven't seen ads for Perpetua in TIME or LIFE or
    Newsweek either... but I may be missing things far more subtle.)\r\n\r\nSince
    before the era of computers, ordinary people in their homes didn't have phototypesetters
    or even Selectric Composers, the idea of marketing a typeface to the general public,
    as I envisage it, would be to create a demand for published materials in that
    typeface, so as to encourage its sales to the usual suspects.\r\n\r\nBut that
    leads to a different tangent: Prestige Elite and Courier are typefaces too, and
    IBM marketed its <em>typewriters</em> broadly enough at times that they could
    be said to be addressing the general public. Would that count?"

    about value, not income. Therefore bundling is marketing\u2014as long as it\u2019s
    not perceived as spamming (although that could be construed as negative value,
    which is still value). Certainly, Comic Sans has acquired enough value to be notorious.\r\n"

    rather than advertising. \r\n\r\nYou can bet that fonts that do get press attention
    have had major, labour intesive marketing work done with them beforehand. I'm

  body: Yes, but I cannot imagine many people actually buying (or using it if they
    do) Typespec's Doves because, for example, in keeping with the original, it does
    not have italic, small caps or lining figures. Of course, there are workarounds
    but . . . and didn't the press coverage have more to do with the story-novelty
    of diving for it in the Thames than with the face itself . . .

  body: "That's how it works, though, you need to judge how the media value news stories
    and tailor your marketing accordingly. The person who co-ordinated the diving
    operation was acting out of interest and curiosity, definitely, but it will also
    help his company sell more copies of the typeface I'm sure, whether through direct
    clickthroughs or through raising awareness of its existence.\r\n\r\nA lot of marketing
    works this way. The actual story sold to newspapers is rarely the \"story\" the
    marketers want out, which is inevitably \"here's our new product, please buy it\".
    (A press release written that way, unless the product is exceptionally innovative,
    will rarely result in more than specialist press coverage.) Instead, the story
    is modelled to the specifications the media wants, to maximise exposure, and the
    fallout from that (if correctly designed) will result in increased exposure for
    the client as well. New York Times writer Rob Walker calls this sort of strategy
    \"murketing\" \u2013 using indirect stories of no obvious connection a specific
    product to eventually sell it, being dark and murky about the actual marketing
    intentions. \r\n\r\nHere in Sweden, now-defunct PR agency Studio Total was infamous
    for this sort of thing. They'd even routinely create fake products and blogs and
    music releases and whatnot to build up momentum, only to eventually be revealed
    as something else entirely. I'm not saying font makers work this way, often the
    story is genuine, but their marketing efforts can work using the same underlying
    mechanism."
