  body: "Hi Ryuk, you put me on the spot:)\r\nAnyway the lettering of \"TURKISH &
    AMERICAN BLEND\" is in the style of the rounded serif approach style that was
    popular circa 1900. Not certain if they were in a font or just artwork. Something
    fairly close is captured in the italic of Jeff Levine's Lamp Post, a smoothed
    version of  Post Old Style \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/lamp-post/\r\nDon"

    considered naming them Dromedary cigarettes? Or change the picture and call them
    Bactrian cigarettes? Would they have sold as well?\r\n\r\nWould YOU walk a mile
    for a Dromedary? Or a Bactrian? Maybe not..."

    had several old folks tell me they started smoking on the advice of their doctor
    - to calm their nerves.

  body: "Hi Mike. Camel's doctor endorsement campaign was matched by other tobacco
    companies. This is almost as perverse as the advertising claiming radioactive
    salts were a feel good treatment for aches and pains. Or when you could stick
    your feet in an x-ray machine in a shoe store to check the fit. Or the nifty radium
    coated hands on watches so you could see them glow in the dark. Anyway, enough
    rant for today. \r\nDon"
