  body: "The style of lettering this is based on is extremely prominent in Sweden
    to this day \u2013 supermarket employees are still taught lettering using markers
    and a lot of (especially smaller) supermarkets still prefer writing out special
    offers and prices this way, over computer printouts. I tend to agree, it's a very
    dynamic and impactful style."

  body: "Ikea Script mimics the result of lettering with permanent markers. Some more
    examples: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/IkeaScriptTypophile98394_3487.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/IkeaScriptTypophile90453_5655.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IkeaScriptOurBestPrice_5306.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IkeaScriptAsIs_6673.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/IkeaScriptKullen_6100.jpg]\r\nUnless
    Ikea has recently changed its signage, you could probably compile an alphabet
    by taking a camera on a walk through an Ikea store.\r\nAnother similar: Walmer
    Marker by Typolar, from Finland, which may share some of the Nordic design sensibilities
    of neighboring Sweden [img:sites/default/files/old-images/WalmerMarkerByTypopolarSM_5660.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/walmer_marker/\r\nDon"
