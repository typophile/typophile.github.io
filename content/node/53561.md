  I'm not even sure if it is a font or just handwritten. The logo is pretty old, as
  you can see. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm looking for a font that is as similar as possible
  to this, to use in a video. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\nEivind Lie Nitter"
