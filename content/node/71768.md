body: "Hi. I have created a typeface that has been pretty well-received, and I would
  now like to create more weights of the typeface, as their seems to be a lot of interest
  in the new weights. However, I can't figure out a good strategy for moving forward.\r\n\r\n
  The process that I followed for the original weight was not very economical and
  I'm sure it was not the best approach. I designed the typeface in Illustrator, and
  used the relatively cheap typeface software TypeTool to create the actual typeface.
  The face is meant to look a little quirky, but I took a pretty geometrical approach
  to building it -- I know the exact rounding of each corner, and width of each character
  and line (with exceptions made for aesthetics, of course).\r\n\r\nHowever, even
  after following this process, i tried importing the characters into Typetool and
  the typeface was destroyed. So i had to go in and set up a grid, and then check
  every single vector point for every character, snapping them to the grid as outlined
  in this article:\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/contact-and-support/product-faqs/faq-fontlab-typetool.html\r\n\r\nI
  can't imagine doing this for every character that i create from now on. I'm hoping
  someone can shed a little light on what is the best approach for creating new weights,
  and how other typography software handles this. For example, do other (perhaps more
  advanced or high quality) softwares require this type of grid setup for the characters
  to be imported without distortion?\r\n\r\nIs it best to create the other weights
  in illustrator (which I'm very comfortable with) or do other typeface softwares
  provide a better method for doing this?\r\n\r\nI know this is a very subjective
  or vague question. I'm just hoping that others who may have faced similar issues
  can share what they have learned about creating typefaces.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for any advice you all can give. And by the way, here's the typeface I've been referring
  to, which is free to download and use: http://derekweathersbee.com/franchise/"

  body: Hi. Had a look at your font. First of all you should figure out a step by
    which the size shrinks. Your typefaces width of stem for bold is 117. You should
    figure out a width for hairline, for example 117 - 20 (97 - regular) - 20 (77
    - light) - 20 = 57 hairline. Then draw it. Then you could use option blend fonts
    to make light and regular. Then redraw the results (they will not be very perfect).
    At least it is how I do it.

  body: Thanks a lot ( a late thanks ) for your response. Do you mind telling me briefly
    what you mean by "option blend fonts"?
