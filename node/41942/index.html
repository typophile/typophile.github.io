<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Anybody over 35 will recognize at least a few of these... the rest of you kids just appreciate how good you've had it. On the other hand you'll all be wearing glasses by 30.
http://www.drawger.com/show.php?show_id=32
Loupes, brayers, rubylith, proportion wheels, haberrules, rubber cement thinner, rapidographs, and my sentimental favorite, the stat camera which launched my career. Another 80s artifact was the fact that my "office" became an after-hours hangout when the designers and A.D.s would come in to take advantage of the privacy and the large plate glass. Use your imagination. </div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Stat camera? Me too. I worked my way through school on one.
Gotta add this to the list though—a real favorite for obvious reasons.

<div class=commentbody>Nice, I own(ed) almost all of these items, plus some more. European brands of course. Takes one back…
BTW The handiest targets were those on a roll that had a stick-on counterpart included that would stick to the overlay's back. Using that must have saved me days of my life.
I (partly) graduated on illustration work, printed in cmyk, with all seps done by hand (with ben day rub downs and so). Weeks of work. But I do know what a fles tone is made of (and that’s something I still profit from).

<div class=commentbody>Haley - those were used to gauge leading and do quick line counts. Not for point size. There was another annoying tool for that, a glassine you put on top of the type. It had the standard fonts but wasn't all that reliable.
The thing was, you really needed all that stuff. Now you just need a laptop.

<div class=commentbody>Patty, my dad had an employee that didn't quite understand that you could "layout" the work on the computer at that time. He only used the computer to "set the type" and then would proceed to wax it and play with line (word) spacing and everything. I got him in a little trouble when I showed my dad that it could all be done on the computer. ... Maybe that is why this little guy is listed. </div>

I'm curling up in a ball thinking about that screen. My second job out of school was writing and editing a 2000 page, two-volume catalog using a SE. I still think that probably shaved a few years off my life.
Yes Tiffany, I included that cleaning pad partly because it leaves such a nice mark on the back of a black sweater.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I do remember that transition period, though. I remember setting type on the mac as galleys, then a bit later composing pages on the Mac but still having to leave boxes for the FPOs, before we got a scanner. And the early Mac layout programs (eek remember Pagemaker) were pretty limited, not to mention the font selection.
But still, that little Mac doesn't qualify as "forgotten" in the same way as the rubber cement pick-up or transfer type.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I used to teach a course years ago which included a section on copyfitting. One ofthe assignments I gave was to take a given typewriter written manuscript and specify the amount of space it would occupy after being set in type of a certain specification.
You had to be able to count and do arithmetic in those days to be a designer :-)

<div class=commentbody>By an odd grace I skipped over all that stuff, even though I've been in this racket 40 years. I went from a letterpress composing room and pressroom right to a Macintosh in 1988. I knew all that stuff was out there, but it was never used in any shop I worked in. I have a drawer full of it here, though, for my predecessor was in this office for 30 years, and he left it all behind, even color charts from before the days of the zip code. & a slide rule!

I have made maybe 3 mechanicals in my life. When that necessity arose I took a shirt cardboard, squared it up on the kitchen counter, and attempted to paste things down straight with a carpenter's square and whatever glue was around the house.
And I am really glad I did not have to do that, for I am too clumsy. I could work well with small bits of metal type, and I loved it. But all that thin paper, good lord, what a time I had with it.
I still do keep a sandpaper block on my desk to sharpen that red pen when I mark proofs, though.

My T-square is gathering dust around here somewhere.
To be complete, you'd also need all the various assorted papers: matte board, mechanical board, vellum, acetate, tracing paper for cover sheets, foam core, plus a roll of white artists tape.
And let's not forget spray mount. And those white cotton pads to remove the wax and rubber cement. And a good cutting board.
And bandaids for all the slips with the X-acto.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ok,
I'm not always smart, I never figured out how to use a percentage scale. However, I learned better that still helps me out today, a calculator and this formula:
desired size / actual size.
Works in every type of measurement too. No round scale for me, no way! I'm modern!
Remember rubboff type, kinda like custom Letraset? I did a lot of that, talk about bestine cocktail X8!
Where is the fat type specimen? You know, the ones with all the funny numbers to spec type with usually 1,500-3,000 fonts? Then the one line specimens? I speced type too, you digital sons of a guns, who never had to do that!
Any Ruby tape? C'mon people! :) It's cheap now!
I still like E scales.
I use a 54 year old ruler (still the best!) Metal, my last name on it! Set in Eurostile, while it was still new.
Hope people still use Pantone guides, at least in a pressroom?
The Truth shall set you free</div>

<div class=commentbody>Rodrigue - the proportion wheel was for scaling - if you knew your actual dimensions and desired width you could calculate the height. I figured out how to do it on a calculator too which was much more precise.
I hope people use Pantone books too. It's the only way to know what you're getting with print.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I still have a lot of that old stuff from the Seventies and Eighties--french curves, ellipse templates, eraser guides, dividers...
The little Mac in the museum is appropriate in my case: On my first Mac, before DTP software was invented, I set up a spreadsheet in Microsoft Multiplan (the predecessor to Excel) to calculate run-arounds and mortise cuts for spec'ing type for layouts and other copyfitting tasks at the magazine I worked at. I also did thumbnail layouts and other preliminary design stuff in MacPaint. I had one of those famous Mac bags and lugged the thing back and forth to work every day. The idea of a company putting a computer on an art director's desk hadn't come yet, but they didn't mind if I brought one from home.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I used to have a "handy" hand operated wax machine. It had a handle with the electric cord coming in the way all the time. Also, once hot, it was essential not to knock it over. In an earlier job we had a table model, which had huge amount of small pieces of paper floating in the wax – all escaped from careless paste-up artists in a rush. In that room we made paste-ups for daily newspaper ads for a department store.

We've also go boxes of Lettraset and Geotype, (type, drafting symbols, halftone film and colour overlay film, custom printed logos) and some other cool stuff. WE keep up with the times - just not as they happen.

<div class=commentbody><cite>I was forced to work with some of this “tools” on the first three semesters of graphic design scool altough I started doing some “design” in highschool with word and as a kid with paint.</cite>
My first exposure to tools like these came from my elementary-school classes in Mechanical Drawing (alternating with Woodshop) back in the 60's. I developed a chronic obsession with drawing tools, and the years I spent working in a graphic arts house with all the implements we've been reminiscing about were among the most intensely satisfying of my adult life -- with regard to office supplies, anyway.
I learned a lot from those years, including the trick of using non-repro blue pens to annotate books and photocopies, in case I want to make copies for my students (and don't want them to know what I thought noteworthy). It's been years, though, since I talked to an art supplies store clerk who knew what "non-repro blue" means; I have to track down the correct shade from the shelf myself.</div>

Wow, those obviously never made it to Finland. Our Graphic Designer's School made a trip to Japan at the end of the studies, and I found in Tokyo a beautiful X-acto Gripster knife with a square bit in the end to stop it from rolling. I still have it (and the more traditional one, too).</div>

<div class=commentbody> It's nice to see a picture of the first Macintosh I had, with 124k of memory and an external hard drive, my friends didn't understand why I spent so much money on a gadget with no future...
I still use sometimes some of those tools, the metal ruler, exacto, even the rubber cement and the roller, I also love drawing with the sergent-major pen, I still have a boxfull of them.

<div class=commentbody>No mention of Cow gum? You could do your paste-up and get as high as a kite in a badly ventilated room. Then, when it was dry, you could get all the superfluous dry rubber off with an existing giant dirty rubber ball. Kids today? - Don't know they're born.

<div class=commentbody>I'd quite forgotten about the Cow Gum until you mentioned it Nick. I'm sure I've got a tin somewhere, but I can't find it.
I did find these though…[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fix_6318.jpg]

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/enamel_5433.jpg]and last but not least, two stainless steel stencil knives. Originally for hand cutting Autotype Amber and Green, and Rubylith. Still used every day to weed out computer cut Rubylith and self-adhesive vinyl.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stencil knives_4305.jpg]</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dude those are some of my favorite toys right there.
I don't know what I'd do without an electric eraser.
I find it easier to make my own transfer paper though. Saral is a little waxy and hard to paint over sometimes, even the graphite flavored one. For other colors I get stuff from the fabric store.</div>
