  out what font is used for the text \"i love you\" on the gift wrapping paper in
  this scene from How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days. For the second image, I made the background
  darker in an attempt to help see the type. Thanks. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wrapping-paper-(front)_5086.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/wrapping-paper-(close-up)_6518.jpg]"

  body: I suspect it's custom. Gift-wrapping paper is often produced by the same companies
    that make greeting cards, and greeting card companies are possibly the last large-scale
    employers of handlettering artists.
