  old \"Custom\" type logo. This time it's a personal logo that I've been working
  on for a long time. I * think * it's finished. Do you?\r\n\r\nContext: This is a
  logo for me as a person, and as an artist. I wanted to create a simple, one color
  mark (for now...I'm ol' school that way) which incorporated my initials (d + m),
  and also spoke to an abstract idea of my belief that I'm both physical (the shape
  of the M) and yet directly linked to a spirit (the curving shape of the 'd', which,
  yes, does resemble a flame...I love a good flame job on anything, and fire has a
  spiritual connection, too).\r\n\r\nTechnically, (for what it's worth) I've built
  a little ink trap into the middle of the 'm.'\r\n\r\nFire away, comrades. Tossing
  this into the wonderful fray of the Typophile community signifies a final group
  review on this thing before I implement it (tattoo, business cards, etc.)\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your raw feedback.\r\n\r\nDylan"

  body: "Dylan,\r\nNice mark. I like the concept, but feel it's a bit unbalanced.
    The D has much more visual weight than the M. I think lengthening the 3D M and
    sharpening the baseline angles might add some weight and balance. \r\n\r\nI like
    the play on the physical/spiritual in the mark, but a part of me still wants to
    see the M take on a more organic shape. The D is so striking, that the M pales
    in comparison.\r\nMy two cents.\r\n\r\n\u2014 tom\xE1s"

      that up to this point. Anyone else agree that it's a stretch to see a D and
      M immediately? Or at all? Even after I send you a box of warm Krispy Kremes
      to your house as a bribe?\r\n"

  body: "I would have mentioned it if it had been a problem for me. I will say that
    I see the mark as a complete symbol first, then the individual letters. Because
    you explained the mark in the description there was no way to see it with fresh
    eyes so to speak.\r\n\r\nIf you need a negative to feel the critique is honest,
    I would say that the mark has a particular flavor that is strong. I would expect
    your work to have a similar style, and without knowing for sure, would anticipate
    that you have a working style of illustration as well. Now I'll go check."

      tom\xE1s\":\r\n\r\nThanks, Tom\xE1s. They were a good client, to a point. Good
      client because they gave me total freedom. Jon and Jim Goslee are great guys
      that way...very laid back brothers. But I never made the time to outline to
      them the effective nature of a complete identity system. So they're 'brand'
      has been a mishmash of stuff since. But they've opened two more locations, which
      begs the question...Would any extra effort on my part been worth the effort?
      And that's food for another thread, right? Again, thanks for the compliment
      about the work. I thoroughly enjoyed doing it for the Brothers Goslee. Someday
      I might reach down, grab a pair (my pair, to be clear) and get serious about
      doing that kind of work full time. "

  body: It's very nice. I like the shapes and the concept of the water drop in the
    middle is very cool, but it doesn't read a 'd.' That's not a bad thing, though,
    the 'M' for your last name would suffice if people happen to miss the 'd.' It
    is characteristic of your work, and if you want it to make it more like a 'd,'
    just don't overdo it!
