  body: "Oddly enough that seems a rare style (inline sans with lower case). The closest
    I found was a rather hand-drawn looking font called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/elemeno/guildenstern/\">Guildenstern</a>
    by Alex Grecian.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me someone once gave a sort of tutorial about
    how to use graphics software (like Illustrator) to create your own inline fonts
    by using either outlining or offsetting. I think it might have been Nick Cooke,
    but I can't recall the details now.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: 'Yes, that''s the easiest way I''ve found: set the text to white and tweak
    the outline until it looks appropriate.  You can do it with Illustrator or mess
    around with InDesign as well.'
