  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I just read that a letterpress simulator called LetterMpress is being developed. It will be released first for iPads. You'll place and arrange type on a press bed, lock the type, ink the type, and print. You can print your design or export to other applications.

Apparently the developer is trying to raise development funds through KickStarter. (I have no connection to this project; I just thought it looked interesting.)

		<div class="commentbody">I have trouble wrapping my  head around this. If it exports an image, then it will be useless for actually creating letterpress prints, unless it's a high-resolution, un-antialiased image that will be used to make a custom die, in which case the process really isn't any different from using any other software, cuteness aside. Right?

It says something about eventually wanting to acquire metal and wood type so people can actually create prints, but does that mean the program will email finished designs to a mothership and the mothership will ship finished prints to the user? In that case, I'd personally rather just go to my local print shop.

Can someone help me understand this?</div>

It sounds like the program will contain both pictures of the (backwards) wood type plus scans (vectorized?) of what each letter looks like printed.

He also mentions a later phase, where you'd be able to send your layouts electronically and their shop would actually set up the type and print it letterpress, then mail it to you (I wonder what they'd do if you sent them a layout with more "Z"s than they had actual type...)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, I think you've got it right. The plan is for them to take your iPad layout, set it up in wood and/or metal type, and print it using  the ink and paper you chose from their menu. It seems they're still trying to raise enough money to buy more type to offer users more variety (and so they're less likely to run out of <strong>Z</strong>s).
What I like about the interface is that it shows users how letterpress works, and lets them experience (in a clean-fingered way) the limitations and the possibilities of the medium. And once LetterMPress is able to make printed copies, users can show all their hipster buddies what real printing looks like. </div>

The developers are basically asking the public to donate 15,000 so they can setup a nice print shop with lots of wood type. In return, they promise to develop a silly ipad game you can use to order letterpress printed posters from said developers?

Seems like a pretty clever business strategy.

I think so, but it would also be useful to graphic designers who wanted to simulate the look of letterpress in their layouts using authentic letterpress fonts. Sounds like a cool app to me.</div>

I do love my iPad, and that giant check looks  great until one considers that there are 65,000 apps to divide into it for an average of 300k per app per year... Ex post taxo, that's not even a monthly run rate for a small company.

And the economics aren't even that good. We can assume 20% of the apps collect 80% of the revenue (I'd guess it's even more skewed than that). That means the other 80% of the apps (52,000) share 20% of the revenue ($400M), which is less than $8K per app. And the original $2B is a 31-month number, so it's even less than $8K annually.

Probably it would be more profitable for these folks to just open a real letterpress shop.

Well, after purchasing $15,000 of wood type, they will have a real letterpress shop. And nicely marketed via a fun iPad app. 

The app, itself, may not be the key component of the business model here. </div>

Sure, but those hobbyists aren't asking strangers for $15,000 for the chance "to make a few hundred bucks." The lack of meaningful accountability in the Kickstarter system — donors don't get ownership, they don't get interest payments — means that it tends to attract good-natured grifters.

Though maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way. I could be using Kickstarter to fund some new, expensive hobbies of my own. For instance, that 3-week luxury cruise to Antarctica. Uh, I mean — my photography project investigating global climate change.</div>

Kickstarter is a curated funding method for artistic projects. My guess is that an app like LetterMpress would appeal to a fairly small group of users and thus self-funding its development, including spending thousands for original wood type, just wouldn't happen without some kind of underwriting.

Does the project leader have devious ulterior motives?  I dunno, but he seems to spell out pretty clearly what he's using the funds for, so potential donors can decide for themselves. 

Personally I'm not planning to donate anything, but if the app gets made I'd certainly buy a copy if the cost was reasonable. It looks pretty cool.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What confuses me though I love this idea, is how many people are actually going to order output? and if that's a very small number, then it's just a toy that does not need the actual fonts behind it, just the images. Collecting images of wood type would be cheaper, the acquisition of type being only the beginning of the expenses for this product's fonts. Someone like me would gladly give them images of my wood type, (though most of it is so big, not a word would fit on an iPad screen).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It looks cute. It looks fun. It looks artsy. It's the kind of thing the iPad owners instinctively flock to. If priced in the $5.99-$9.99 range the app will probably sell like hotcakes. I'm not sure, however, how the "get your design printed for real" thing will do, but I'm willing to bet that a bugfixed version of the current beta could probably raise the $15000 needed to stock a wood type letterpress shop without the need to beg for venture funding.</div>
