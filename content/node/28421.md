body: "Hey so I am confused on the gsm for text/cover/book/bond/bristol/index/tag
  and while reading up i realized i need to read up more on it. \r\n\r\nWhy are some
  papers measured in weight and some in the ppi thickness? If a paper supplier doesn't
  say what the paper is to be used for but only lists the gsm, how do you know if
  it is for text/cover/etc.? How do you match a bond, text, and cover grade for suitable
  collateral publications?\r\n\r\nI worked in a print shop for a very short period
  doing production but I would like to read up more on this stuff. Any good resources?"

  body: At least gsm (grams per square meter) is an objective measure that doesn't
    vary based on it's purported use. Beyond that you have to get to know each paper
    for its material content, surface, folding, cutting, tearing, and ink carrying
    properties. The name on a paper only gives a vague clue as to it's usefulness
    for a particular purpose. You can have a hundred different "Bristols" and have
    the only thing they have in common be that they are semi-rigid paperboards. If
    you find a paper sample that you think will work for the task you intend to put
    it to, don't worry about what it's called.

  body: "Hey Jesse I notice on the other post that you have found M-real, who are
    very cool. Talk to the paper suppliers \u2013 it's in their interest to educate
    you, and they oftentimes have truckloads of good informative (and, natch, promotional)
    reference material. Mohawk recently sponsored an exhibition all the way out here
    in NZ!  \r\n\r\nThe design books often have background (it's out of print I think,
    but The Designers' Handbook by Alistair Campbell, pub. McDonald Orbis, was always
    good on this) but nothing beats talking to a paper suppliers sales rep., preferably
    an old one. I never liked caliper measurements for paper anyway."

    Alan Pipes' Production for Graphic Designers (fourth edition)</a> which is much
    more recent. Adobe also used to publish a Guide to Professional PrePress, which
    I haven't seen in a while.\r\n\r\nI say this because the titles by Craig and Campbell
    date from the late 80s/early 90s. The big deal then was about whether or not the
    paper surface could hold a conventional halftone dot; now that we have first-generation
    digital platemaking, stochastic screening and computer-controlled on-press densitometers,
    this is maybe less of a consideration, and people just expect to get better reproduction
    on even ordinary stocks."
