  body: "A logo is similar to a trademark. It's a visual symbol for the brand, and
    may appear anywhere the company wants to identify itself: On a website, product
    packaging, business cards and letterhead, advertising (digital, print, or TV),
    vehicles, promotional items, etc. A logo may be composed of type, custom lettering,
    or images (abstract like the Nike swoosh or pictorial like the Starbucks mermaid),
    or some combination of the above. A logo has strict specifications that must be
    followed regarding color, aspect ratio, orientation, etc.\r\n\r\nA banner, as
    I understand it, is a header for a web page, or an advertisement embedded in a
    web page. A banner may include a logo, but it may also contain other words or
    images, and unlike a logo, its design may vary depending on its specific purpose.\r\n"

  body: "As I recall, they are usually termed 'banner ads'. I have read of 'banner'
    being a full-width headline in a newspaper, which may be where the 'banner' in
    'banner ad' comes from.\r\n\r\nAs for 'a company's banner', I think that is more
    akin to a medieval king's banner (flag or standard with his heraldic device on),
    where the banner is used as a symbol for the company. A part makes whole, or something
    like that."

  body: "Why is someone who works for a web design company asking about these basic
    terms? My first thought was that it was a spammer.\r\n\r\nBut since we're answering
    the question, in addition to the definitions already given \"banner\" can also
    refer to a decorative device highlighting a small amount of text. It can hold
    a logo, but usually not. \r\n\r\nIn my experience (mostly printed materials) this
    is the usual definition of \"banner\", but maybe it's different in web design.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/banner2_6010.jpg]"
