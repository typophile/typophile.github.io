  Something that has perfectly round circles as the 'O' \r\n\u2022 Similar in thickness
  to.. say FUTURA HEAVY \r\n\u2022 Just something thick that if I introduce a perfect
  circle as the 'O' \r\nwon't look out of place, will look in proportion to every
  other character. \r\n\r\nLet me know if I am being confusing? \r\nThanks"
