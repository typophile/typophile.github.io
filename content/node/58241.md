    you know that using a front page done entirely in Flash is the most effective
    way of making sure that Google never indexes your site (or lists it very high,
    at the least). Perhaps that is your goal, but if you actually want people to visit

    all that you have done with Flash and get better indexing with HTML and some simple
    Javascript."

    word break &lt;wbr/&gt;) after \"Static/\" would improve the word spacing.\r\n\r\nI'd
    be tempted to loosen the tracking in \"THE ART OF THE RESUME\" as the \"UME\"
