body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/handwriting_samples_for_typophile_4036.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for any of these brush text or handwriting type using a brush for a fashion
  project I'm starting, topic is denim. I love the big \"writing with a paintbrush\"
  style type but i think what I mostly see is just painted and photographed. I'mm
  attaching some stylistic elements here or maybe these are actual fonts? \r\n\r\nSuggestions,
  ID's of any of the above (although I think they might be one offs), anything welcome.
  Thank you!"

    looks pretty impossible to get with a font...
