  <BR> <BR>From the Typographic Circle  <BR><a href="http://www.typocircle.co.uk"
  target="_blank">http://www.typocircle.co.uk</a>  <BR> <BR>3rd Tuesday  <BR> <BR>Our
  new monthly event, 3rd Tuesday launches 18th January.  <BR> <BR>Our members and
  audience often mention that one of the nicest things about  <BR>our lectures is
  that they are social and an opportunity to meet, talk and  <BR>exchange ideas. Bruno
  has responded by starting up 3rd Tuesday in  <BR>association with The Friends of
  St Brides who will be helping out also to  <BR>subsidise the bar.  <BR> <BR>So far
  we have not planned to hold formal talks or to have any structure but  <BR>hopefully
  it will take on a life of its own.  <BR> <BR>3rd Tuesday will always be represented
  by the attached logo which will soon  <BR>begin to appear in badge and t-shirt form
  of course. Orders are already  <BR>being taken, sight unseen!  <BR> <BR>The Friends
  of St Brides and the Sign Design Society have expressed a wish  <BR>to have ties
  with the Typocircle, I am circulating details of lectures from  <BR>both groups,
  for which our members will receive discounted entry.  <BR> <BR><b>Alessio Leonardi&#39;s
