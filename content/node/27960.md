    That's just silly. Take a look at any of [[ParaType]]'s script fonts and you'll
    find the same things. In fact, some slavic languages <a href=\"http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/4452/bgvsru9vl.jpg\">including
    Bulgarian</a> prefer roman forms that more closely mirror the script forms."

    other Cyrillic characters which are more difficult to write don't revert to a
    Latin form so why the de? And I disagree that a script double-bowl 'g' is more
    work since I sign my name with one (easier than that convoluted thing they taught
    me in school) and the font I'm working on already has that form for the Roman
    'G'.  And if easier is the reason why wouldn't the same apply to the upright?
    The Latin form is easier to write than the Cyrillic.\r\n\r\n<em>Take a look at

    but why? That's what I want to know. Compare PT Betina Script with PT Birch --
    similar non joining scripts -- and Betina uses the Latin 'D' and Birch a Cyrillic.
    It would seem to make more sense to change to the Latin form for a flowing scirpt,
    but PT Adventure does several odd things: Teh (U0422) for instance, which is more
    complicated. Is the choice merely based historical precedence or what? Is there
    a rule of some sort?\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge \r\nI felt bad because I had no shoes,

  body: "<em>Betina uses the Latin \u2018D\u2019 and Birch a Cyrillic</em>\r\n\r\nThey
    are both cyrillic, just as two different script shapes of d are. Betina's designer
    (Alexander Tarbeev) made the upper \"serif\" of D longer and tilted the vertical
    stem slightly to the right so it resembles a traditional cyrillic script D, but
    can also work as latin D (for which these features are acceptable but not critical).
    Why use the same shape for both, while it was easier to make two different ones?
    I guess some people like a challenge. \r\n\r\nBirch's uppercase, strictly speaking,
    is not a script alphabet - it has no specific script forms. Its D is a \"printed\"
    shape made with multiple strokes and no circular motion, while script D is made
    with one stroke - down/left and counterclockwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    This looks like it will be of great help. \r\n\r\nDo you also know of any good
