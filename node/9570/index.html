  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey all. So I'm finally getting down to making some type instead of thinking and talking about it. My first experiment is on a (sorry in advance) handwriting font to match up with one of my clients' corporate face. <BR> <BR>I'm running the Scanfont/TypeTool combo (sorry, I won't be upping the ante to FontLab until I get my sorry  up to OSX). <BR> <BR>The specific problem I'm encountering now is that the screen version of the font looks quite terrible. For the most part this doesn't bother me as it's printing alright. But I'm thinking if I get around to letting this face into the world then I should do what I can to make it more usable for folks. <BR> <BR>What is it that I need to learn to make a font display sort of ok on screen?  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, free beer in Vermont, Hello Hrant, <BR> <BR>g <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Gahlord - you're alive!  :-) <BR> <BR>Assuming you're not going to upgarde to FontLab (which may be able to auto-hint your font satisfactorily - but maybe not, since it's handwriting), you have four choices: <BR>1) Hint it manually using Fog. This is the normal practice for high-end fonts, but mucho work, plus Fog's hinting is half-baked. <BR>2) Edit the GASP Table so that it renders anti-aliased at all sizes, so that the lack of hinting doesn't matter. Problems: you'll need special software (although VTT is free); and it assumes the font will be used on an operating system that has smoothing enabled. <BR>3) Edit bitmaps. This isn't as bad as some people will have you believe, although it's too much work if you have to do too many point sizes, plus some OSes won't support it. <BR>4) Leave it as is and tell the client they can't afford the real thing. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The GASP table is something in a TT font that tells the screen renderer at what PPEM (screen point) sizes to use hinting and/or bitmaps. The only no-cost way to edit it that I know of (short of hand-editing binary code) is by using VTT: <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/News.asp?NID=655" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/News.asp?NID=655">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/News.asp?NID=655</a></a> <BR>What you would do is tell it to ignore hinting at all sizes. <BR> <BR>&gt; What OSes won't support the hand edited bitmaps?  <BR> <BR>Good question&hellip; <BR>I'm behind the times on the Mac side, but I've heard that newer MacOSes ignore bitmaps.  :-( <BR> <BR>Insight into this would be really appreciated. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
