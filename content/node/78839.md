body: "Hi All - I found this community this morning and registered so I could ask
  a question. I searched before posting but couldn't find an answer (at least that
  I could understand). \r\n\r\nI should preface my question by saying that I am a
  newbie when it comes to understanding the intricacies of type, even though I am
  fascinated by it. \r\n\r\nSo here is the question/problem:\r\nI recently purchased
  a couple of fonts which have true small caps in the glyph set. In the past I had
  always just used the computer-generated version of small caps most programs include,
  but after reading a few things and trying it out I realized that they look horrible
  compared to the real thing. I mean, there is no comparison. So am I trying to find
  a way to use the true small caps in a way that avoids having to manually choose
  each glyph one click at a time rather than by key-presses. \r\n\r\nThat is my question:
  is there a way to use true small caps more easily than choosing the glyphs and then
  manually inserting them one at a time?\r\n\r\nI am using a Mac (hopefully that doesn't
  offend anyone), and am working in Pages and Nisus Writer Express. I recognize neither
  of these software packages are the ideal for this kind of thing, but since I am
  merely an enthusiast I can't see myself shelling out a bunch of cash to get a new
  app, just so I can use true small caps more easily. \r\n\r\nI've wondered about
  several options, but have no idea how to pursue any of them, such as changing the
  key-bindings (e.g. press alt-g to get small cap \"g\") or hacking the font to create
  a duplicate 'small cap' version (but this may well violate some copyright agreements
  and I don't want to do anything illegal). \r\n\r\nIn short, I am at a loss. What
  I want is to be able to press a key or combination of keys and get a true small
  cap, or switch some option somewhere to get them when I type the regular letters.
  Having the letters recognize as the letters (e.g. a \"g\" as a \"g\") so that spell
  checking doesn't choke on the words would be a bonus. \r\n\r\nCan anyone help me?"

  body: Generally, if the fonts in question have the smcp feature and the applications
    in question are OpenType-aware, you can get true small caps by highlighting your
    selected text and activating the smcp feature (usually with a checkbox on the
    character/font palette). However, I'm not familiar with either of the applications,
    so...

    a separate font.

  body: "In Pages, what you want is the Typography palette. Go to the Fonts palette,
    click on the cogwheel thing toward the bottom, and select \"Typography...\" from
    the menu. This gives you access to the OpenType features, including small caps,
    that you can apply to the selected text. Since it's a pain to get to, you'll want
    to define a character style for small caps.\r\n\r\nI have no idea about NWE. When
    I last used it, maybe five or six years ago, it didn't support OpenType features,
    but maybe it has been improved since then."
