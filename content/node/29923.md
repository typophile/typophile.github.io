  body: "Definitely Microgramma, which is what granfathered and inspired Eurostile,
    but way better with more variations. People confuse them all the time, but this
    was the one seen all over the place in the 50's-70's, especially in industrial
    trends.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/microgramma/\r\n\r\n"
