body: I am interested in knowing what the typeface is for this book title. I intend
  to use some of the letterforms as starting point for lettering in a logo I am beginning.
  My apologies for the poor quality of the scan. It&#39;s the book&#39;s spine as
  the cover was messed up with library barcodes and labels. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24431.jpg"
