body: I got close with this one - looks like the &#39;G&#39; and &#39;J&#39; are Formata.
  Am I on the right lines? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif"

  body: I don&#39;t think so, David. It has some Lucida Sans qualities, <BR>but the
    tail of the J tells it&#39;s neither of them.

  body: '...could it be a mixture of two fonts? It looks to me that the top of the
    G and the end of the J have flared serifs but the other two letters don&#39;t?
    Maybe this client is having a lend of me &#40;as they say out here in Oz&#41;???'

  body: Idunno Paul, the thing looks pretty balanced and  <BR>homogenic to me. It&#39;s
    got some Optima traits too,  <BR>this is mucho weirdo. I might be doing a FontBook  <BR>run
    tonite, maybe I get lucky. I&#39;ll keep you informed.

  body: 'Three of the letters are in the seventeen that I use in my <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html"
    target="_blank">Sans ID Guide</a> samples. The G is one of the 7 key letters and
    steers me to Style Codes 1-4 or 21-24. The R is another of the keys and it narrows
    the choices to those with  a second style code of 9 -16 or 41-48. I wrote down
    three candidates from looking at the samples that fit those codes &#40;you need
    lower case letters to really home in on an answer, so this is the best you can
    do with the Guide&#41;. My candidates were: <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=403340"
    target="_blank">Linex Sans</a>, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/presencetypo/tschichold/tschichold/testdrive.html?s=A%2BG%2BR%2BJ&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Tschichold</a>, and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/syntax/syntax/testdrive.html?s=A%2BG%2BR%2BJ&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Syntax</a>. I guess looking at these Linex Sans might get my vote.
    What do you all think?'

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR>and &#40;b&#41; though I&#39;d like a bigger sample
    to be able to  <BR>compare it better, I think we still got a problem with  <BR>the
    weight &#40;Linex Sans Light looks darker than our  <BR>sample&#41; and the top
    of the G which appears to be cut  <BR>off at an angle and not vertically like
    the sample.  <BR>This is the closest match by far. Nice one Mike!

    -- Yes, I know. It was a compromise to save screen space and download times, since
    there are so many images on a page. Still, I find it helps me eliminate the ones
    that are obviously non-matches.  I had the same thought about the weight of the
    A in particular. I was hoping the reversed image of the original sample might
    have given a different impression, but I tend to agree. I know there are many
    Sans faces I have yet to catalog, but I have about 700 familes now, so it&#39;s
    a useful tool most of the time for me.'

  body: Thanks Mike &amp; Yves - very impressive typo-encyclopaedic knowledge &#40;as
    always&#41;. Guess what? - the client has gone with another font as this one was
    too hard to ID. Grrrrrr. Appreciate the effort though.
