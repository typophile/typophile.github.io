  there certain visual elements that can be agreed upon, more or less?</strong> Please
  take my quick survey to help me answer this question for my research project.\r\n\r\nHere
  is the link:\r\n[[http://bearsinflight.com/type]]\r\n\r\nI am surveying both designers
  and non-designers, to see if there is any correlation in opinion. When a designer
  chooses a typeface for an advertisement, is the effect of the typeface wasted on
  a different audience, or do they see the same thing? It is an important question
  and so far, the opinions have varied greatly.\r\n\r\nPlease take the survey\u2013
  all information will be put to good use. I am also interested in hearing your extended
  opinions here."

  body: "This is wrong.\r\nIt's like asking the musician and the listener what they
    think of the sound of a particular musical instrument playing a random melody,
    and assuming that has some bearing on the effect of a musical performance.\r\nOr
    asking the chef and the diner what they think of the taste of an herb, and assuming
    this has some bearing on the success of a dish.\r\nFor design it's useless, and
    is detrimental to students developing their own discriminating taste. \r\nAs statistical
    research it is hopelessly amateurish."

  body: "I'm not sure you fully understand what I am looking for. It is not about
    preference or success, it is about the underlying meaning found in type designs.
    Even if a typeface is intended to be completely neutral, it carries certain attributes
    along with it. For example, when a designer is creating a poster for a rock concert,
    they will, most likely, not choose an old-style serif type, because it implies
    some kind of formality and age. What I am studying is the consistency of this
    so called \"typeface personality\" among people of varying backgrounds.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are still opposed to the study, that is fine. There are plenty of other people
    who have expressed interest in the topic."

  body: I understand what you're looking for, and I'm sure Nick did as well. But your
    survey is pretty much worthless considering you don't actually gather any data
    about who's opinions you're soliciting. There are both designers and non-designers
    here. Type designers and graphic designers. People from all over the world. Young
    and old. Male and female. Etc. Also, what you're researching is a complicated
    and multifaceted phenomenon that is amateurish to quantify it in such a superficial
    way. If you want some more useful data fluff you should develop a more robust
    semantic differential that also includes some information about your subjects.

  body: "Okay, jackson, thanks for your feedback. What you are saying is absolutely
    correct and I realize this is not the most robust or comprehensive survey. All
    I am looking for is evidence of a trend. I chose to make the survey rather quick
    and easy to obtain as many samples as I could. I am treating this more like a
    preliminary study\u2013 to find if there is any trace of objectivity in the \"personalities\"
    of typefaces. My professor is actually hoping to take the study further in the
    near future.\r\n\r\nThank you for the feedback and I'd also like to thank everyone
    who has taken the survey."

    may just be what keeps you from getting any results that are actually <em>meaningful</em>.\r\nTo
    name just one thing, the method isn't well thought out. You're offering adjectives
    to pick and choose from; but certainly the range of words that designers and non-designers
    use to describe typefaces will not be congruent. \r\n\r\nMaking a survey that
    yields meaningful results &ndash; and then actually finding those &ndash; doesn't
    just mean filling in \"quick questions\" with equally quick multiple-choice answers,
    putting that online and telling people to go there. It's actually a science in
    itself."

  body: "I'd kind of agree too. The words on your list are not words I'd really use
    to describe fonts. You could add a field 'add your own tags' which would perhaps
    give useful info. Or check out the tags people have added on MyFonts.com.\r\nOr
    engineer it so that for each page, a random selection of 12 words from a dictionary
    of many more pops up. Having the same tags on each page makes it really difficult
    to differentiate my feelings about each font.\r\nPerhaps you could also show all
    the samples on one page to be better able to assign different tags to each.\r\nI'm
    also a bit mixed up about whether I should tag 'new' for something that I haven't
    seen before or for something I know was designed in the last few months or last
    year as opposed to centuries ago. The same goes for 'weak'...am I supposed to
    tag 'weak' if I don't like the font or if it's light on the page?...it's a bit
    unclear at what level the tags should be attributed.\r\nBear in mind that the
    designers and typographers here are pretty rigorous and that's what makes Typophile
    so useful. But you won't get anywhere near the same answers as non-designers,
    and quite probably the answers will be rather difficult to draw conclusions from.
    I guess I'm saying I'd like to see this work...good luck! ;)"

  body: "It is axiomatic that lay readers and typographers see type differently, and
    that content, layout and specification affect the viewer's perceptions. \r\nEven
    for the typographer who is familiar with a face, and for whom it has a wealth
    of meaning of which the lay reader is ignorant, there are other considerations.\r\nFor
    instance, in the many ways of categorizing types, consider this index of familiarity:\r\n-
    Types I have worked with but not used in finished pieces\r\n- Types I have used
    in finished pieces\r\n- Types I have seen occasionally used by others\r\n- Types
    I have seen often used by others\r\n- Types I have only seen in print or online
    specimens\r\n- Types I have seen discussed"

  body: "Some modifications for version 2:\r\n\r\n1. Investigate using [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoword|pseudowords]]
    instead of using real words as the semantics of the words will almost certainly
    influence subjective response.\r\n\r\n2. Randomize the order of the pseudowords
    <em>as well as the order of the responses</em> to counterbalance the design.\r\n\r\n3.
    Create a simple form which requires people to input demographic data: Age, gender,
    vision, first language, education &c\u2026 so you can draw correlations.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a good start."
