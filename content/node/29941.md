  category of typeface that mixes elements of both the [[serif]] and [[sans serif]]

  Best Term for a Typeface That Combines Elements of Both Serif and Sans Serif?</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<--!
  Note: I'm not sure this is the right term, as there are straight text fonts with
  \"Semiserif\" in the name. \"Hybrid\" something or \"Mashup\" might be a more appropriate
  wiki page for this type of font. - S. Coles\r\n\r\nNote: Stephen, i'm not sure how
  the term \"semi-serif\" is used in reference to these other types of fonts. Can
  you point me toward some samples, so that I can expand this article to include both
  usages? -->"
