  serif typeface?\r\nI know it is not the right way to make  a sans-serif font but
  maybe something like that has been done.\r\nI will be grateful  for any examples."

    version of small i for the Basic Typography line.

  body: "Martin Majoor describes his technique of making the sans versions of his
    serif faces this way. I don't think it works, since it ignores so many other aspects
    of balance that need consideration. \r\n\r\nMatthew Carter, long ago, did some
    experiments in 'sansifying' a Renaissance Roman (no particular typeface, just
    letterforms), but didn't continue with it. It wasn't meant to produce direct results,
    and it didn't. \r\n\r\nThen there are all the quick and dirty grunge faces from
    the 90s where serifs were clipped to make a \"new\" face. Once the clipping operation
    was over, they weren't \"classic\" anymore....\r\n\r\nThis does bring up the dilemma
    that we call such typefaces \"sans-serif\", which implies the former presence
    of serifs, even though it's really not true. The last 100 years is awash in this
    style of letterform. Shouldn't there be a different name by now? \"Lineale\" or
    \"Grotesk\" anyone?"
