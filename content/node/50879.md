body: What would be a good serif font to accompany Cholla Sans & Slab fonts for a
  technical guide? I had been using Weidemann Book and liked the light, compact feel
  but feel it's a bit old fashioned and was going to switch to Rotis Semi Serif to
  give it a more modern look but that font seems funny. Other fonts I looked at were
  Trump Medieveal, Swift, Apollo, and they all kind of have more of a book reading
  feel and not really technical guide. Any suggestions?

  body: The reason Rotis feels funny is that it was made like a engineering plan,
    not a typeface. I would look at a modern, sturdy Dutch face like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bitstream/oranda_ot/">Oranda</a>,
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Olsen">FF Olsen</a>, or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_nexus_mix_ot/">FF
    Nexus Mix</a>.

    for bodytext. May sound weird, but worked out fine.

    might work well.\r\n\r\nFor a serif, how about [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=meta+serif&x=0&y=0|Meta
