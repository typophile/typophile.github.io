  body: Not long after that thread, Kivart replied to my e-mail. I had encouraged
    him to contact Fred Peter. <BR> <BR>Instead, Kivart, who had created the font
    from an image of the lettering provided by a friend, was aghast that the lettering
    was actually an existing &#40;albeit dry transfer only&#41; typeface. He pulled
    Gamme from his website and would not reconsider. <BR> <BR>I remain very sorry
    to have played a part in that. Subsequent efforts by myself to contact Mr. Peter
    have been unsuccessful.

  body: Jeez, that&#39;s  a bummer! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry to hear you went to all
    this trouble and at the end turned sour...  <BR> <BR>As for the font. I did managed
    to scan it at high resolution from the letraset book,  <BR>and did it the old
    fashion way...cut and paste. <BR> <BR>Now the question I wonder about; Technically
    speaking is this a breach of copy right even if I don&#39;t sell it to others.
    <BR>&#34;Heck I can&#39;t get it anywhere else&#34; is my justification. BUT that
    is all it is. a justification. <BR> <BR>What do you &#40;or anyone thinks on the
    matter&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks again for the info and link&#40;s&#41; Mike <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>Serge

    it can spend in file TTF for not making it:) I wait an answer satisfactory Thank

  body: "This looks like a thread in which I made the first post \u2013 but it isn't.
    It's a portion of an older thread that someone else revived.\r\n\r\nJorge: Gamme
    isn't mine to give you. You would have to get the permission of Fred Peter and
    Kivart - in that order.\r\n\r\nI really wish that Kivart had tried to talk to
    Fred Peter and try to come to some agreement, but he chose not to. It probably
    didn't help that he was shot in a drive-by posting here by a respected name in
    typography \u2013 in which he was effectively called a \"font pirate\"."

  body: "Thank you for your answer!! \r\n  \r\nBecause serious very good that gave
    me a way to contact this person: Kivart to see that one can make in this respect,
    I think that there is not anything bad in carrying out a file TTF with some design
    in I specify, bad serious that one carried out it with ends of lucre or to market
    a work that doesn't belong together for royalty, there if that is Pirate of the
    worst that works are awarded that you/they have not made, in the personal thing
    I have carried out one that another file only for personal satisfaction and it
    doesn't stop to market neither to make money with something that is not mine.
    \ \r\n  \r\nbut good in short, I need you help me to contact to kivart to see
    I eat up he/she can help!  \r\n  \r\nJajajaja Excuses my translation to English,
    since not yet you to speak to it very single leeo and I understand what you/they
    write, for that reason I appeal a translator for computer  \r\nThank you again!
    \ \r\nGreetings from Mexico! :)"
