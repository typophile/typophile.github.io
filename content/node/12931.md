  body: I've been known to grouse about font pricing/packaging by some foundries (House,
    Berthold, Castcraft), so I thought I'd throw out some praise for Stereo Type Haus
    and their great deal for the splendid fonts which comprise the Tribeca family.
    Even if you mentally discard the "small caps upper" fonts (as I would), that's
    still 12 nice fonts for $60!
