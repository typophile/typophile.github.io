    from the U.S. so I wouldn&#39;t have a clue to what they were doing during that
    period of their history.

    this one is Futura, but I don&#39;t imagine apartheid had a corporate typeface.

  body: It&#39;s an interesting exhibit, but unfortunately the web site photos are
    not pictures of signage used. Maybe the home page was supposed to be, and that
    looked like Franklin Gothic to me. No doubt materials in the museum would show
    the sort of signs you are asking about, but that web site wasn&#39;t much help,
    from the portions I saw. <BR> <BR>As Tim noted, there was probably no unified
    typography associated with Apartheid, although I also guess that like most governments,
    there was a government printing office that was responsible for official signs.
    But this is a guess. It could just as easily have been left to the towns and cities
    to provide their own signs, for all I know. <BR> <BR>Natalie, if you can provide
    samples, we could see if we could ID them. Remember that many of the signs would
    probably have been made without the use of computers, if they were made before
    the mid-80&#39;s.

  body: Mike - you are right. I only checked it for images after I posted. Sorry ...
    <BR> <BR>I lived there for a while - before and after the regime died. I cannot
    remember seeing a &#39;corporate style&#39; face for apartheid related communication.
    <BR> <BR>It was so much a part of the culture that signs were not all issued by
    the government - you could buy them. <BR> <BR>I can talk to some South African
    friends and see if I can learn more about this for you. In fact, my father-in-law
    was in the building trades back in the day - he would know about signage and way
    finding systems. I will ask him next time we call. <BR> <BR>Mike

  body: Thank you all so much. I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have any examples but was
    encouraged by my tutor to find if there was a corporate face. All I came accross
    was the government website style guide which allowed for Helvetica, Arial and
    Verdana. But this is only for the website unfortunately... I&#39;ll see if I can
    find samples.

    printers in Pretoria.
