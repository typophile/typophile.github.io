body: "I am not a type designer but I work with fonts almost every day. I help several
  type designers to build accented characters, class kerning and OT features. During
  the last four years I've came up with dozens of font families from different designers.
  Every type foundry has its own glyph naming scheme and different suffices.\r\n\r\nThere
  are many type designers from many type foundries here on Typophile. I think we should
  together make a well prepared <strong>glyph naming scheme</strong> and then force
  all the important players in the font industry to accept it as a standard. I am
  sure we all would benefit from such initiative.\r\n\r\nIf the glyph names would
  have standardized suffices, FontLab (or third party developers) could offer tools
  to build OT features based on glyph suffices and glyph names. It would be easier
  to work with encoding files etc. It could also help programmers, their scripts and
  testing routines would be accessible to a broader group of users without the need
  to modify the code; also the scripts designed to build OT features based on glyph
  suffices would be easier to write and use. The font production would benefit as
  well: it would be easier to copy features from one font to another etc. etc.\r\n\r\nThis
  new standard could be used in two different ways. I can imagine FontLab would allow
  users to switch between production glyph names and standardized glyph names. During
  font export, the glyphs could be automatically converted to proper glyph names (uniXXXX,
  afiiXXXX).\r\n\r\nWhat should we do?\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Standardize glyph suffices.</strong>
  We could either follow Adam Twardoch recommendation to use suffices based on standardized
  code for OT features, either we could use more user-friendly suffixes (sups v. superior).
  We should discuss this.\r\n2. <strong>Standardize glyph names with two or more suffices.</strong>
  For example alternative form of small cap A (a.small_alt, a.alt_smcp...).\r\n3.
  <strong>Standardize glyph names for ligatures.</strong> Should we use ffi, f_f_i
  or both? Should we assign Unicode indices to ligatures? How to name ligatures composed
  of alternative forms of glyphs? This should be discussed.\r\n4. <strong>Create user-friendly
  names</strong> for Cyrillic and other glyphs. I understand that to name Cyrillic
  glyphs could be a difficult task as not all the users pronounce the letters the
  same way, but I am sure type designers would benefit from this standard (even if
  the standard would only be for production). Also many other glyphs should have names:
  arrows, letter-like symbols, math symbols, dingbats...  \r\n5. <strong>Create a
  \"Typophile Glyph List for New Fonts\"</strong> and offer type designers tools to
  covert old glyph names to this new standard and tools to convert this proprietary
  encoding back the current standards. This should be accompanied with a document
  explaining problematic glyphs, their names and Unicode indices (scommaaccent v.
  scedilla, fi v. f_i etc.), language specific problems (ligatures and small caps
  in Turkish etc) and other exceptions and irregularities.\r\n\r\nI look forward to
  your feedback."

  body: "Much of the f lig naming thing seems to be from what glyphs are part of the
    standard. The problem comes with re-seperating the lig into its native characters
    when making a text file for PDF files. f_f_l will work but ffl won't. The ligs
    fi and fl are part a standard encoding but require some shoehornimng to extract
    to readable text in ascii--hence the underscore versions. I hope their is some
    way to fix this. In OpenType, the liga feature can be written to make the f_f_l
    lig instead of the ffl lig out of f f l but I don't know about non-opentype fonts.
    I hope John Hudson, Si Daniels, Thomas Phinney, and Adam will come by and correct
    my interpretation as well as chime in on your ideaa.\r\n\r\nTHANKS, Filip!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Thanks, Chris, for you reply. Actually, I understand the glyph naming problems
    quite well, but not all the type designers do. My proposal is not only build a
    list of glyph names, but also tools to use it, and explanation why to use it.
    The knowledge is hidden in many threads here at Typophile and other forums but
    it should be collected and offered to everyone. In the end, we all would benefit
    from it.

  body: "This topic surfaces from time to time. It seems to usually be directed to
    us here at Adobe. There is usually some internal debate about it, so I don't want
    to imply that we (Adobe people) are all of one mind on the subject... but we've
    collectively considered and rejected such proposals before.\r\n\r\nFor quite a
    while I was the person who was most directly confronted with glyph name issues,
    having to produce many of the fonts and create tools to handle them. (And we just
    revised the entire library, which gave me even more cause to agonize over glyph
    names.) Now that Miguel has joined us, he might be using and managing glyph names
    just as much -- and of course everyone else in the group also has some exposure
    and opinion.\r\n\r\nI dare say that for most of the OpenType era, but at least
    for the past five years or so, we have had fairly stable name standards at Adobe.
    But it's true that some names have changed. The thing is, we are usually pretty
    thoughtful about choosing names, and so the fact that we have changed them is
    the exact reason why I am reluctant to endorse some universal standard. No matter
    how thoughtful we are, something happens later to provoke a change to something.
    The more canonized a list becomes, the more trouble it becomes when a name changes
    -- and believe me, with a library of fonts as huge as Adobe's, that kind of trouble
    can be pretty unpleasant.\r\n\r\nWe do have our own [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html|glyph
    name conventions]], but I sense that this proposal is more about name suffixes,
    which are of no particular consequence in Adobe's recommendations. Some favor
    the feature-code-as-suffix approach (e.g. \"seven.dnom\"), while Adobe and others
    favor the descriptive approach (e.g. \"seven.denominator\"). For base names, Adobe
    name conventions have worked fairly well for us, as they rely on a manageable
    list of the most common names, falling back on reliable uni names for the rest.\r\n\r\nFor
    suffixes, I am personally worried about \"attaching\" a layout feature to a glyph,
    when our association of features to glyphs is subject to change. There are already
    plenty of examples of Adobe fonts where we have moved a glyph from one feature
    to another. Of course now -- after the growing pains of OpenType in the early
    years -- we think we have it figured out pretty well, but there will be new issues
    and new features. It's already painful enough to consider moving a glyph from
    one feature to another because of compatibility issues, but things would get much
    scarier if I wanted to move, say, \"A.salt\" to the \"ss01\" feature. There could
    be cases of a glyph being accessed via two different features, or (as you illustrated)
    multiple alternates from one character in the same feature. All that can be handled
    one way or another with a name standard, but in can get complicated and increase
    the chances of mistakes (i.e. non-standard or conflicting names). A little freedom
    in this territory can be be nice to have.\r\n\r\nIf you get the sense that I am
    fearful of change, you would be partially correct... but it's only because I've
    been trying for ten years to weed out all the peculiarities of our glyph names,
    and things are starting to finally settle down a bit. I like the names we use
    at Adobe, and don't mind that others use their own conventions. It seems like
    the current balance gives enough necessary structure and predictibility without
    boxing us in.\r\n\r\nBy the way, regarding ligature names: They are pretty much
    settled in Adobe's name conventions. A name '\"fi\" refers to the single Unicode
    (ligature) character, whereas \"f_i\" refers to a ligature of two characters.
    It is indeed tricky to figure out suffixes for ligatures of alternates (e.g. \"f_i.alt\"),
    and even at Adobe I don't think we have much of a system other than semi-arbitrary
    \"alt1\", \"alt2\", and so on. So even if this thread doesn't result in some massive
    name overhaul, I think there's still a lot to discuss and improve in some areas."

    on their work process. I am glad you are all willing to share your experiences
    with the rest of the community. On the other hand, those of us who do not have
    Adobe's resources need to work with each-other to minimize wasted time and reinvention
    of the wheel. While I am sure there is much we can borrow from the Adobe method,
    there may also be things small foundries and individual designers can gain from
    going a slightly different path. I am not talking about breaking unicode standards,
    I am talking about developing working conventions which we can share easily that
    may not end up on the release files. I am not sure if this is what Filip alludes
    to but I certainly support his effort.\r\nAs an example: If I develop a font with
    suffixes smcp and someone else uses sc, it is harder to share and teach each-other.
    If someone like Filip does work for small foundries and every file he gets to
    work on has a different {yet opentype compliant) scheme, it requires more work
    for him and he has to charge his clients (us) more for it. If we all agree on
    a system, things move faster, cheaper, and with fewer chances for errors. Adobe
    does all of their work inhouse so this is not an issue for them unless individuals
    within Adobe don't follow corporate standards.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Filip -- <cite>1. / 2. / 3.</cite>\r\n\r\nAdobe's glyph naming and unicoding
    document says what's relevant, and -- obviously -- for good reasons avoids being
    too specific about suffixes since, in the end they are of little relevance. Except
    for production which you have in mind.\r\n\r\nI would read Christopher Slye's
    comment this way:\r\n\r\nWhat is important is that suffixes are descriptive, in
    a meaningful way. Then it does not matter whether you use 'sc' or 'smcp',* or
    how you arrange multiple suffixes -- they can be 'translated' into whatever a
    script needs. As to combining multiple suffixes, even this can be done in many
    ways. For example, I combine them like 'A.sc.alt.swash' (not that I ever did such
    a glyph). For a script a period and an underscore are equally fine, as is the
    suffix order -- unless this has some special meaning for a <cite>particular</cite>
    script.\r\nOld fonts with completely arbitrary glyph names (or worse: glyph names
    that do not even represent the letterform, like a ligature named 'less') need
    a human being anyway to 'translate' glyph names.\r\n\r\nSame goes, by the way,
    for class names. Make a name as descriptive as possible, with information on case,
    script, whether the class is 1st or 2nd of kerning pair if it's a kerning class,
    etc. This may be helpful for <cite>possible</cite> scripts. (Class names won't
    go into the compiled font anyway.)\r\n\r\nFilip -- <cite>This new standard could
    be used in two different ways. I can imagine FontLab would allow users to switch
    between production glyph names and standardized glyph names. During font export,
    the glyphs could be automatically converted to proper glyph names (uniXXXX, afiiXXXX).</cite>\r\n\r\nAn
    option to converting production to final names upon font generation is on my wishlist
    too. AFDKO's GOADB is a nice model for this. Another option could replace suffixes
    upon generation, to help abbreviate glyph names.\r\nAnother option: Some tag (glyph
    name suffix? another 'negative' .enc file?) could indicate which glyph are to
    be deleted upon font generation.\r\n\r\n* For educational purposes, one can easily
    say that what is 'sc' to me, is 'smcp' to you. Same for scripts. Personally I
    think that every font is different, and it isn't possible to transfer features
    from one font to the other, or generate them.\r\nIndeed a lot can be learned from
    Adobe's experiences. Christopher Slye's description suggests that they do internally
    what independent designers/foundries try to do externally: coordinate the work
    of different people.\r\n"

  body: "I don't think a standardised glyph naming scheme is necessary, beyond what
    Adobe define for glyph-to-character parsing, which is obviously a different need
    than that of font developers, hence the distinction between final glyph names
    in shipping fonts and what I call development or production glyph names. I'm also
    not convinced that there is a need for a standardised set of development glyph
    names, because as soon as you have two sets of names -- final and development
    -- that need to be convertible, you need a robust means of mapping from one set
    of glyphs to another and performing reversible conversions. And as soon as you
    have that, you have the means to switch between any other set of glyph naming
    conventions.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I don't think something like FontLab auto-generation
    of OTL lookups based on glyph names requires a standardised set of glyph names.
    What it does need is a means for developers to associate whatever suffixes they
    like with particular layout features. I don't want a tool like FontLab to force
    me into using particular glyph names: I want to be able to tell the tool what
    glyph names I was to use.\r\n\r\nSome things that we now do may be a bit simpler
    if there were a standard set of glyph names, but I'm not sure this justifies the
    effort to produce and agree on such a set. And what if, sometime after the set
    is agreed, I come up with a better method for, say, naming Devanagari glyphs or
    Arabic ligatures? Should I refrain from making use of that better method, for
    the sake of conformity? I know from looking back at the evolution of my own glyph
    naming systems that they have gradually improved as I work on different and different
    kinds of projects.\r\n\r\nSo what I value is having powerful and flexible tools
    to allow me to convert between naming systems."
