  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello to you all!
I don&rsquo;t post here that often, but i keep visiting these forums because i realy think typophile is of the most interest. :) i have to thank you for all i&rsquo;ve learned here!
so, i&rsquo;d like to share with you an idea:
I have recently started teaching tipography history to adult students in a professional school, and i felt an enormous difficulty in transmiting to them the importance of tipography (some of them, before these classes, had never thought about letters&hellip;)
well, to make it simple, i made an experiment with friends and i wanted to know what do you think about this before i try it with my students:
step one: close your eyes and think of a random set of numbers (ex. 123) - imagine their graphic apearence in you head.
step two: draw them on a piece of paper, with all the graphic characteristics you imagined (with serifs or without them, thin or bold, condensed or stretched&hellip;)
step three: try to find out, in your everyday lives, something that might have influenced you in those graphic images.
.
i don&rsquo;t know if this sounds strange to you&hellip; i got answers that surprised me. We got to the conclusion that the numbers we drew were influenced by, for exemple, the lettering of the numbers in our mobile phones, the lettering of the house numbers in our street, or the tipography of the last book we read.
.
this means (i think) that we assimilate the graphic images around us, and that they change in the course of time, in our unconscient.
.
i think it would be interesting to try it also with the &ldquo;image&rdquo; of our name :)
.
thank you in advance for your thoughts on this!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It seems quite a good approach to me, to make people realize the importance and transparency of the written form.
However, I find quite depressing they were impressed by mobile phones' numerals…</div>

		<div class="commentbody">:) the &ldquo;real deal&rdquo; was that they had no idea that their subconscient had pic up such an unimpressing thing has mobile numerals&hellip; we never know&hellip; that was my conclusion. 
it was funny to do this with different people, from different &ldquo;lives styles&rdquo;, and different levels of awareness to typography :)</div>
