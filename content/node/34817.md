body: "Design educators in our midst are going to want to take note of the Type &
  Design Education Forum that SOTA is presenting at this year's TypeCon.\r\n\r\nMore
  information about the Education Forum is now posted at the TypeCon website: <a href=\"http://www.typecon.com/education.html\"
  target=new>http://www.typecon.com/education.html</a>\r\n\r\nThis should prove to
  be quite a unique opportunity for design educators to find inspiration and share
  information about teaching type and typography to the next generation of designers.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nThe
  forum topics will cover a broad range of subjects -- from overall curriculum development
  for different kinds of programs (2-yr vs. 4-yr, liberal arts institutions vs. art
  schools, etc.) to specific assignment presentations. \r\n\r\nThere will be break-out
  sessions for mixing it up with idea exchange, dialogue, and networking. And the
  final panel will focus on ideas and methods for instilling in students the kind
  of fascination and passion for typography that we know so well here at this site.\r\n\r\nThe
  Forum is being organized by SOTA board members Ilene Strizver and Mark Jamra, both
  of whom have spent many years in both the type industry and design education field.\r\n\r\nFellow
  Typophilers Will Powers and James Montalbano will be presenting. Perhaps next time
  they pop by, they can chime in with a preview of what they're planning to bring
  to the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    of the panel discussions. What the panel brings to the discussion about creating
    a passion for type will dictate what role I play. Maybe referee, or maybe bouncer.\r\n\r\nJames"

    to be able to contribute some of your experiences and insights, even while you're
    moderating, yes?\r\n\r\nDo you think you'll be sitting in on any break-outs?\r\n\r\n--
