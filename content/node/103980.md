  with licence agreements. \r\n\r\nIn doing so we realised that as a consequence of
  the firm growing and personnel turnover, we have some fonts which we don't have
  the full licences for. Generally speaking this is where we've purchased a one-user
  licence, but now more than one person or workstation use the font or that in embedding
  fonts in PDFs and allowing clients t distribute electronically we are in breach.\r\n\r\nIt
  seems an almost impossible job of ensuring adherence to agreements when the industry
  and technology is changing so rapidly and that the foundries don't make the task
  easy and put all the emphasis on adherence down to conscience.\r\n\r\nWe are now
  in discussions to replace many fonts with a library such as Adobe's type library
  to future-proof and make life easier.\r\n\r\nObviously this comes up time and time
  again, but why isn't there some sort of standardisation in terms of EULAs? In a
  straw poll of similar agencies most agree that they have illegal fonts and/or are
  not adhering to EULAs.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to garner peoples thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  are there any foundries offering a good library other than Adobe (with similar EULAs)\r\n\r\nThanks!"
