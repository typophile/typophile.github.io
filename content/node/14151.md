  body: "I think the GANDER MTN looks like a modified version of <a href=\"http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=AG61206201M1\"
    target=\"new\">Aquarius</a>. At first I thought Colossalis, but its M crotch reaches
    the baseline, unlike the sample M. The other lettering could be many things, as
    long as the O is round and the R has the leg in the same position. Stone Sans
    and Folio could be two candidates.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
