body: "Iv been designing a new website portfolio for myself, and i was using the 'paper'
  symbol on many printers for icons for each project. I am a print based designer
  usually. I wasnt trying to make a logo but i turned the symbol upside down and it
  looked like a P, so i made this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logos_6213.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  thing is im never really in favour of personal logo's especially for students (like
  me), comes accross slightly pretentious to me. However im using the paper icon on
  my site anyway so i though this might be acceptable.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about
  it? Does it say 'print designer', i have a bad feeling this is such an obvious logo
  it will have been done a thousand times. I wasnt really looking to make a personal
  logo but this just came to me..."

  body: "Well, I like logos in general... so I also like personal logos. Although
    I'm sure there's logos that use the paper icon (and I'm sure countless with CMYK
    color schemes) I've never seen one upside down. The fact that your first initial
    is hidden in there is a nice accident. I'd suggest to try adding a counter to
    the \"P\" but I think that would destroy the subtly... and probably ugly it up
    a bit.  \r\n\r\nSometimes the most obvious solution is the best one. "

    Very nice!

  body: iv actually decided not to use it. Apart from not really seeing the worth
    of a student having a logo, i dont think it actually suits my work. But if im
    ever doing a logo for a printers beginning with P...

    It's a good idea!\r\n\r\nWe're designers. We're supposed to be pretentious. Go
    for the logo! ;o)\r\n\r\nIt does seem obvious, but I've never seen it, and it
    does work great with your 'P' so go for it. The best logos ARE the ones that seem
    so obvious in hindsight."

    Agree, it's simple and effective. Besides it's not like you're paying for it.
    I when you grow tired of it you can always change it. Another thing to keep in
    mind is that you'll probably never be 100%happy with you're own logo design (design
    is both a gift and a curse for us). :)"
