    between the 'J' and 'A' need also some closer kerning next to some other very
    little adjustments in the words.\r\n\r\nGr Jeroen"

    to try use the 'o' as the hole in the center of the record.\r\n\r\nI really like
    the concept, but the type needs some adjusting - maybe some different fonts and
    maybe some resizing and layout changes."

    I tried a lot of fonts out that were used on jazz albums of the 60's/70's.\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone have some font tips?\r\n\r\nYou could be right about the layout and font
    (resize) change.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The design of No. 157 says <em>old</em> to me, not <em>new</em>. I think
    you're on the right track with No. 162. The mix of caps and lowercase, of wide
    and condensed, of serif and sans, are the visual equivalent of swinging improvisational
    music. \r\nHaving all the lines justifed feels wrong, though, like you're playing
    on the beat when you should be syncopating. How would it look if you moved <em>MESSENGERS</em>
    a little to the right and <em>OF JAZZ</em> a little to the left?\r\nI personally
    would tighten up the linespacing a tiny bit, but that's just my own preference
    in a headline with no descenders. "

  body: "Nice work. I agree with what Sebastian said. #3 and #4 lose a lot of tension
    and coherence IMO \u2013 I'd definitely keep the text block. \r\nAlso, I think
    I'd nudge the entire text block a little bit to the left, and *maybe* also up
    a tiny bit. And to my eye the \"JA\" in \"JAZZ\" is too tight now."

    the text block, why not try to make the text fit nicer inside the circle?

    Zeker ten opzichte van de lijnhoogte.\r\n\r\nDe letter compositie vind ik wel
    mooi alhoewel het misschien wat minder jazzy word door de 'sterke eenheid'.\r\n\r\nMisschien
    werkt een andere omkadering beter dan een circel. Ik denk gelijk aan een vierkante
    spreek bubbel aangezien het om messengers gaat!\r\n\r\nVoorbeeld is onderweg.\r\n\r\nGr.
