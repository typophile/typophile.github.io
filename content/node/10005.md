body: I&#39;m setting a short story in n!samual &#40;my own nontraditional book face&#41;
  and part of the story is in the form of emailed correspondence. I don&#39;t want
  to use courier, Helvetica, or Arial. I&#39;m hesitant to use Lucida sans, and American
  Typewriter is over used. I&#39;m leaning towards either Avenir 35 or 45, but was
  hoping for alternative suggestions. The reader needs to feel that this is something
  they could reasonably expect to read on screen, but they&#39;ll be reading it in
  print. Thanks!

  body: Bizarre suggestion. What if you used Nick Shinn&#39;s <a href="http://www.shinntype.com/"
    target="_blank">Handsome</a>? Could be a nicer way to say letter. Although I see
    a hole in this idea as you are setting e-mailed correspondence.

  body: I&#39;m sure if you can describe the characters, the type of company they
    work for, the type of cumputer they are using and the year in which the story
    is set, we can tell you &#42;exactly&#42; which font they&#39;d have picked for
    their email.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: only problem, I want to use something I already have a license for. The nature
    of the correspondence is a romantic one...very indiscreet of the characters, using
    email. My goal is to find something that works on paper and is easy to read but
    has a clean, contemporary feel that would not be out of place in an email. Maybe
    a geometric sans?
