body: "I'm looking to buy a 1200dpi laser printer to use primarily for developing
  type designs. I've been searching around for the cheapest printer available which
  has true Adobe\xAE PostScript\xAE 3\u2122, as opposed to an emulated version of
  Postscript 3. I'm just looking for some general advice from any of you out there
  who may have gone through a similar quest. Any reviews and/or recommendations would
  be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, opinions on the relative qualities of
  true postcript machines vs. emulated versions would be also useful. Is there any
  difference, and if so, how great/marginal is the difference?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for your contribtuions.\r\n\r\nMike Ives"

  body: "i just bought an HP laserjet 1320 and i think it's working out OK. granted,
    i'm just getting started myself, but it seems like the 1320 is a good deal in
    the less than $500 category, when i was looking, it seemed like the only true
    Postscript printers run at least $1000 and well over,  which was out of my price
    range.\r\n\r\ni guess there are some even cheaper HP laserjets, but i was told
    that the 1320 is the best for the price you pay\u2026"

  body: you might try picking something up second-hand. laser printers are pretty
    reliable, much better than ink-jets, and by going the use route, you might find
    a better model at a cheaper price then with a new one.

    body: "OK, I had a browse around ebay for second hand printers. Some of the prices
      were good. Eventually I found a huge discount on a Samsung ML-2550 - which is
      1200dpi x1200dpi, and packs an emulated version of Postcript 3. This was probably
      the best I could find (after a days extensive research) in my price range \xA3150/$220.
      I'll let you know how it goes!"
