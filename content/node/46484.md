body: This is a card I made for my dad on father's day. The glasses are styled after
  a pair he has worn since I can remember, they are perfectly him, He is instantly
  recognizable by these glasses, so I thought it was only appropriate to incorporate
  them into this design. Let me know what you think. and leave out the comments about
  me using Helvetica too much, its a beautiful typeface. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture2-2_3769.png]
