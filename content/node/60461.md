body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate your comments on this website...So
  far we only have a front page...and even that's not finished. \r\n\r\nThe venture
  is a mobile recycling company that will pay money for old phones. These will be
  refitted/ recycled etc...and the profits are to go to a charity, that raises funds
  for children's education.The proposition is cash for phones that people have discarded.
  target market- anyone within UK, 16-35, has more than 1 phone, is thrifty or cares
  deeply for the environment.\r\n\r\nThe problem I am having, is that I am a marketing
  person, not a designer. The company actually programming and creating the website
  is absolutely no help.\r\n\r\nSo please do throw some suggestions around on colours,
  layout, pictures and most importantly, the copy.\r\n\r\nhttp://myexphone.com/myexphone/Default.aspx"
