  was debated quite a bit but I think there was still a lot of support on the forum
  for allowing edits. Myself I prefer that the edited post remains in its place in
  the thread, perhaps with some sort of indication that the post was edited. "

  body: 15 minutes seems arbitrary. If the powers that be determine that editing must
    be limited, why not make it until another post has been added?

  body: "Disappointing. I don't know what the point of disallowing edits would be.
    Even if this is Typophile, it is still just an on-line forum. Not the fricken
    Bible. every word I say here is not golden (<em>precious few, actually</em>)...
    And if I want to change or get rid of them at some time in the future it's my
    business. Should be a right in fact, since I believe the word I write are my words.

  body: Yeah I went to edit one of my posts and had the same problem. The reason they
    have limited the time is because of the re-ordering bug. Please be patient while
    they work that one out.

  body: "Well, we had this over and over. I guess there is no solution that is commonly
    agreed on.\r\nPeople were <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/42737/\">complaining</a>
    about edited comments that spoiled the order and logics of whole threads. Others
    want to retain the opportunity of fixing typos or adding links (esp. on the Type
    ID board).\r\n\r\nNow the good Punchcut people have taken action. It might not
    be the final answer, but I\u2019m quite happy with it.\r\n\r\n<cite>every word
    I say here is not golden</cite>\r\n\r\nExactly! So why would I want to go back
    and fix my prattling from yesterday? ;-)"

  body: "Well, the fact that the order is messed up by edits is just the kind of craziness
    some people get used to far too easily and others are driven 'round the twist
    by. Also far too easily. Me, I pass it off as a an amusing quirk, like a car with
    crossed wires that honks when you use the turn indicators. Of all the forums I've
    seen, this is the only one that does that. Obviously the quirky coding is fixable.
    Using it as an excuse the get rid of the edit feature is like getting rid of the
    car because of a couple of crossed wires. Either live with the flaw (It's not
    that big a deal), or fix it. I would wager that no one is <em>really</em> all
    that confused when posts drop out of sequence because of edits. \r\n\r\n<cite>\r\n
    - every word I [or anyone] says here is not golden [russell]\r\n \r\nExactly!

    \r\nThat argument works both ways, Florian:\r\nI don't know... Maybe you don't
    want your spelling mistakes, bad grammar and poor judgment immortalized for all
    time or until the the day the Internet crashes and no one made a backup copy?
    (<em>hypothetical</em> spelling mistakes, bad grammar and poor judgment, of course!
    :\xAC)\r\nYour words are yours and if you want to change them why would anyone
    want to  prevent you from doing so? One is of course at the same time, free to
    not change a thing if that is one's choice.\r\n\r\nThat's my 2 cents\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
