    body: "Monotype Old Style seems to have the  right letterforms but the digital
      version at fonts.com seems not to include a thickened hairline version like
      the old metal type apparently used for the book. Has anyone done a \"text\"
      or \"book\" version of Monotype Old Style, or its general equivalent?\r\nDon\r\n"
