  body: 'That&#39;s why: the half serif on the &#34;n&#34; screamed &#34;Century Schoolbook&#34;,  <BR>but
    the width was all wrong. <BR> <BR><i>&#40;...&#41; thought that the often-used
    styles would not create strong brand  <BR>identification, so this font was developed
    for use on brand names.</i> <BR> <BR>Am I missing something? Tweaking a well-known
    and overused type  <BR>design is definitely <i>NOT</i> going to create strong
    brand identification  <BR>neither. What&#39;s wrong with designing a truly new
    typeface? Bunch of  <BR>hi-brow conservatives. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
