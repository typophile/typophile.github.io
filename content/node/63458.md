    even if we don't know the font name. Carlos is new to the forum. Welcome Carlos.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "True Mike... I knew it was Rezland or Danube on dafont. I just needed to
    confirm which it was.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of respect for Cmsqvl for taking the
    initiative to search for a font ID before posting."
