  in this summer. I have a portfolio class at the moment. Our teacher asked us to
  give our portfolio files and give it to them. They even dare enough to ask to put
  the fonts that we used to the cd. (Outlines is still acceptable) if we dont give
  our portfolio files they would fail us. I opposed this idea but apparently I still
  have to give the files.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestion.\r\n\r\nthank
  you "

    converted to outlines (vectors)? Then the work can't be opened or used and there
    are no fonts present.

    you look at the student handbook, you will likely find something about you owning
    the work, but the school having unrestricted rights to reproduce the work for
    promotional purposes. Getting original files from students is how schools get

      ask for pdf versions of student work for grading, me included. It makes life
      easier and we don't end up having to haul a pile of boards around. Mounted work
      is a pain to deal with and students often don 't bother to pick it up or come
      by to get it until two semesters after it's been discarded. Using pdfs makes
      my life much easier.\r\n\r\nThe school does have a disclaimer as jpad said,
      but it differentiates what the school uses for promotional purposes. For that
      students sign a waiver granting permission for the artwork to be used. If the
      student doesn't want to do that it's no problem. The stuff faculty collects
      is only used for grading purposes and can't be used for anything else. \r\n\r\nI
      also photograph some projects that won't pdf well \u2014 3D stuff. Occasionally
      I will ask for InDesign files just to check on whether the student properly
      set indents and paragraph styles and didn't just hit the tab key. I hate that.\r\n\r\nGeorge

  body: Yeah. I don't get the objection at all. I especially am taken aback with the
    use of "they even dare enough to ask..."  You're in school. Your instructors don't
    "dare to ask," they give assignment parameters. If this is offensive to you, then
    you're in the wrong place AND the wrong field, because you'll be collecting for
    output the rest of your career.

  body: "Well, there are several very good reasons why an instructor would ask for
    such material. First, without knowing the format or application in which the portfolios
    are being created, it's possible the instructors need the font files and all placed
    images to view them correctly (if a PDF won't dofor the purpose of the assignment).
    Second, it's just darn good practice for students to learn about proper file preparation,
    collecting for output, and assembling COMPLETE and ACCURATE files. The third reason,
    as stated already, is that institutions have the right (and in another sense,
    an obligation) to collect work being produced by students for either academic
    review (very necessary) or for promotion of the program to prospective students
    (also very necessary).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em>Any educational institution worth their salt would not require a student

    exact details of the assignment; keeping track of and including the fonts may
    well have been a integral part of preparing the piece. For graphic design projects,
    I don't usually instruct students to include fonts, but I OFTEN require them to
    list each font used in the piece by its exact name and weight.\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nWithout
    being in the class or hearing the assignment ourselves, it's very difficult to
    condemn an instructor or institution. There may have been (re: probably were)
    particular objectives the instructor was trying to achieve."

  body: "I just realize how bad year in school has changed my mind.  I can understand
    that most of the people don't agree with me. I would give the same comment like
    most of you guys. I used to give all my works with no problem. I even gave all
    my prints to my teacher. Sometimes I did design for appreciation as well. I did
    intern for two of my teachers as well. One of my previous teacher also asked me
    to do project for him.\r\n\r\nIn this senior year, I almost didn't learn anything
    for graphic design or typography but I still learn different things :-). I felt
    very frustrated. I always spent my time in library ( I remember where most of
    the good books put even some of the book hasn't been took out for more than ten
    year). I go to museums, galleries or speaker to get inspiration. I do some freelances
    as well and do some competitions to improve my skill.\r\n\r\nSome of my teacher
    don't know what they doing. It is very sad but true. A week ago I was yelled because
    I corrected something. I don't want to talk to much about negative things that
    happened to me. I belive I was trained to deal with people.\r\n\r\nI felt in a
    year I didn't learn anything and most of my portfolio in 5th and 6th semester.
    None of the my work would be put in my portfolio from 7th to 8th semester. Suddenly
    my instructor ( I had this teacher for the first time)asked me to give all my
    portfolio files and i felt that my teacher ripped of my works. My teacher also
    asked to give our website file.\r\n\r\nwithout your comments I wouldn't realize
    this. I am really appreciate it.\r\nthank you\r\n"

  body: Another reason an instructor might be asking for files is that they might
    have been burned in the past by a student stealing someone else's work and claiming
    it their own. It is very easy to copy/scan a commercial piece and make a few modifications
    to it. A good teacher opening a file can see which bits are original and which
    were stolen.
