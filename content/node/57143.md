  as a basis for making cut inlays in mother of pearl like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_baldurinlay_5338.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
  the font looks like an autotrace of something else:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_baldurblech_5832.jpg]\r\n\r\nThat's
  mighty lumpy and abrupt. Any idea of what the source was for Baldur? "

  body: "Some nice suggestions, Nasos. They will certainly be on my roster for uncial
    suggestions for inlays. \r\n\r\nBut what I'm hoping to find out: is there is a
    better (probably older) font that Baldur was based on? I've come up dry in my
    searches, and just wondering if it looked familiar to anyone else. \r\n\r\nIf
    the source can't be found, I will probably redraw it specifically for my purpose.
    The letters are always the one of two sizes. Plus, I need to allow for a .04 inch
    drill bit to start the saw cut, so there has to be at least one space on each
    letter for that. Here's how I've made it in Illustrator:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_04start_5061.jpg]\r\nGiving
    James some choices as to where to start the cut. "
