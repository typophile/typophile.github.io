body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've found something a little strange in my copy of Futura. Wheras
  the uppercase O's in its other weights are all (near) perfect circles, the O for
  Futura Heavy seems to have been condensed and seems at odds with the other weights.
  I need to use both Medium and Heavy in close proximity and the difference is very
  noticable.\r\n\r\nCan anyone explain why this is? I'm wondering if there is another
  version with less of an egg shaped O.\r\n\r\nL-R Light/Book/Medium/Heavy/Bold\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/futura_5940.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot."

    Futuras tended to be more oblate in the curves than others.

    Spiekermann</a> has the same complaint about Adobe's version. You want the Heavy
    from <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/futura_heavy_new_ot/">Elsner+Flake</a>
    or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/futura_heavy_ot/">Bitstream</a>,
    though E+F's Futura is more geometrically round overall. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/families/futura_nd/">Neufville's
    Futura ND</a> (likely different from yours) could be considered the most direct
    digitization as they own Bauer and the original drawings. There is no "Heavy"
    weight, but the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/neufville/futura_nd_demibold/&sample_text=Oages&sample_size=74">Demibold</a>
    is close.
