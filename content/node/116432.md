  body: The IBM Electronic Selectric Composer  was introduced in 1975 and was able
    to produce very nice text for the time. It had a number of fonts and one was a
    nice sans, as I remember, that looked good with Transfer-Letter Helvetica heads.
    Some of those Composer type faces have pictures on the web somewhere.

  body: "What Bob said.\r\nGiven the date, it could have been done using an IBM Selectric
    typewriter, which had its own proprietary fonts that were similar but not identical
    to \"real\" fonts. In the era before personal computers, low-budget alternative
    publications often used the IBM Selectric because it was a cheap alternative to
    commercial typesetting. The headline at the top of the page was clearly produced
    using a typewriter, which is why I suspect the Selectric for the text that is
    too small to identify."

  body: "Good idea Victor. We are fortunate that Luc Devroye has a page on IBM Selectric
    and Selectric II Type Fonts http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-44934.html There were
    quite a few more, even including an excellent simplified version of Engravers
    Old English. But the most likely possible candidates for this image are mentioned
    in Luc Devroye's page, i.e.: _Adjutant_, _Advocate_, _Delegate_, _Bookface72_,
    _Delegate_ [no image, but a specimen I have seen looks similar to Prestige but
    seems to have a higher x-height and a more stylish design], _Elite72_, _Orator_,
    _Pica72_,  _Prestigeelite_, and  _Presigepica72_. Unfortunately, most are not
    digitized, and those digitized are likely to have been revised from the original
    monospace letter forms to proportional ones with a wider _m_ and _w_ etc.\r\nShould
    try and compile a list of the digital versions.\r\nFor example, Prestige is Alix
    by Matthew Butterick for Font Bureau. http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/AlixFB/
    This might work for your image.\r\nDon "

  body: As I remember the Composer had a limited memory and could set justifed text.
    I produced a number of publications using it's output and the guy we had running
    it got very good at making nice looking almost typeset output.
