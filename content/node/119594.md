  the virtues of the new layout, IMO this new FT typeface, at least what shows in
  the headline, is a bad choice - it's a bit spiky and it's busy - almost frenetic:
  it pulls the eye back and forth among the letters. Doesn't assist comprehension
  in moving forward efficiently along the lines of text. Ugg. \r\n\r\nIn contrast,
  the face used in the Guardian article about the change at the Financial Times clarifies
  meaning, doesn't impede. Never mind that I'm contrasting is between serif and sans."

  body: That background tint might be distinctive, but it seems a bit drab to me,
    plus it would make it harder to read in low-light situations.

  body: "The letters in the headline on the front page of the 'The Financial Times'
    as exhibited on 'The Guardian's website were clear ( and I thought it was jumpy
    and distracting). I assumed that the same face, 'Financial', was used in the body
    type, but maybe was mistaken. I'll have to search out a copy of the newspaper
    to see if that's the case. \r\n\r\nThere have been other cases where I felt that
    modernization of the type went awry because might have been done more for window
    dressing than reading facility. The Penguin historical atlases are one case in
    point, IMO. The eminently readable and economical 'Times' was exchanged for a
    more contemporary face, whose name I've forgotten, but it was too weedy, too greedy
    of space ( the layout of the pages was attractively compact with 'Times', awkwardly
    sprawling with the new face ) and had those distracting 'c's with the stunted
    lower curves."

  body: "Talk about type on a colored background, I wish I had kept the back panel
    of a Lundberg California Basmati rice package to illustrate how oblivious a company
    can be to customer utility in its packaging. Lundberg prints its cooking instructions
    in small point size in white on the back of its tangerine-colored packages. The
    type is faint and nearly submerged in the tangerine. You need strong light and
    a magnifying glasses to read the Lilliputian cooking instructions. Belated discretion
    about showing the package.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
