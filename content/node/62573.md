body: "Chennai is a simplified sans serif that was first available in 2007. It also
  includes a number of more traditional alternate forms. I enjoying coming back to
  older work and making modifications and adding additional weights, and am planning
  a rounded slab serif based on this design. I've attached a preview image below including
  the thin, regular and black weights. I welcome constructive comments. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chennai-Sample-Page-Source_6450.png]"

  body: "Made a few minor updates to Chennai. There are three main styles. The swash
    alternates add more of the curved stems/tails (line 1 and 7). The stylistic alternates
    convert the lowercase simple forms to more traditional, Futura like forms and
    the caps are the traditional forms for X W Y and A, etc, and B, D, P, etc. are
    not longer rounded (scattered through the preview). The titling alternates get
    rid of the \"tails.\" (line 2) \r\n\r\n[[http://www.insignedesign.com/downloads/ChennaiC2.pdf|Chennai
    PDF here.]]\r\n\r\nPlease take a look and give me some feedback. How is the 'e'
    looking?\r\n\r\nI've also attached a preview of Chennai Slab. The lowercase ball
    terminals on the s are a problem. I am thinking that for the black weight, I will
    drop the ball terminals.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.insignedesign.com/downloads/ChennaiSlabC.pdf|Chennai

    forward to your comments! They are always useful.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJDooley"
