  body: "Does it seem to anyone else that the R may have been re-drawn? It looks almost
    like the leg runs up through the counter, just a bit. The E seems to be the main
    letter ruling out Stymie, and Rockwell and Memphis have the right E, but neither
    has a matching R, even though Rockwell's is closer. The width of the E could be
    due to using condensed letters mixed with normal width, because the \u0152 glyph
    looks normal width.\r\n\r\nAnother thought that occurs to me is that the French
    foundry may have 'adapted' Rockwell and altered some letters to avoid the appearance
    of completely copying the typeface. After all, wasn't Memphis just the slightly
    modified Linotype copy of Rockwell? Even Stymie was supposed to have been based
    on an early Rockwell version, according to Mac McGrew's book.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hmm, reading the entries in Jaspert's book, seems to indicate that the first
    version of Memphis was Stempel's in 1929, which pre-dates Monotype's Rockwell
    in 1934. Linotype's Memphis was 1935-6, so it's a bit ambiguous, maybe.\r\n\r\nAnother
    possibility is Beton, which Jaspert says was  released by Bauer in 1931-36. Beton
    has the right E and has the same R as one of two in the typeface. Shown on p.23
    of 1991 reprint edition of \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\"\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
