  looking for information about [[FontExplorer X]], Linotype's free Font Management
  application</em>?\r\n\r\nDuring the late 1990s, [[Linotype]] created a product called
  the FontExplorer, which was a catalog plus CD. On the CD, customers could sift through
  Linotype\u2019s font library by using subject keywords and descriptive terms. FontExplorer
  was and is an aide for those looking to find speciific fonts. In 2004, Linotype
  placed the contents of the CD online (http://www.linotype.com/2393/fontexplorer.html)
  for free download (c. 180 MB). By that time, over 1 million catalogs and CDs had
  been distributed.\r\n\r\nFontExplorer and [[FontExplorer X]] are two different products
  that both aim to help font users find the right fonts for their needs."
