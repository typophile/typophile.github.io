  body: "With the insanity of Bourbon Street just outside I think most folks were
    having a good time in the hotel. I tried drinking Sazeracs in three different
    bars, and the hotel bar made the best one by far. I turned Petra Weitz on to Negronis,
    she was trying to blame me for getting her drunk before the TypeQuiz.\r\n\r\nI
    think the conference organizers did a terrific job, and from a content point of
    view, the best TypeCon I ever went to.\r\n\r\nOne of the more compelling presentations
    was done by three gentlemen from the Cherokee Nation, encouraging the type design
    community to develop more fonts with Cherokee language support.\r\n\r\nNo location
    for 2012 was announced. Too many organizational decisions yet to be made I would
    gather."

  body: "I second what James Montalbano said about the Cherokees. They so movingly
    explained how in their efforts to keep their language, reading and culture alive,
    having good typefaces, and aesthetically varied type designs are key to motivate
    people to read, and the preservation and development of culture. They said \"What
    you do is precious, it is a valuable contribution to culture, thank you!\"\r\n\r\nIncredibly
    touching.  \r\n\r\n"

  body: Having been a student of Ed Benguiat at the beginning of my career, I found
    it fascinating watching him hold court throughout the entire conference. People
    were coming up to me asking if possible that I introduce them to Ed. I was happy
    to oblige, and at one point I was kneeling in front of Ed in his walker/seat talking
    with him. It was the appropriate posture.

    read about it, it's interesting and I definitely agree on the typography issue.
    There is, like, one font that's compatible with Cherokee."

    are a few more than one, but most of them are of poor technical quality and mostly
    represent a single style. One of the points made by the Cherokee speakers at TypeCon
    is that they are ready for more styles."

  body: "It was an awesome conference. The mood was super, with content to match!\r\n\r\nThe
    Cherokee presentation also stood out for me. What struck me most\r\nis what smooth
    operators they are (especially Joseph Erb) - they really\r\nknow how to work the
    ropes, getting Apple to fully support a script for\r\na population of less than
    300,000! They're working so hard with so\r\nmuch insight to plant hope where there
    is so little.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight for me was making new friends - usually
    I hang out with\r\nthe people I already know, but New Orleans has an infectious
    friendliness!\r\nOh, and the riverboat cruise at the end - talk about a smooth
    finish.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is funny. I was sampling Sazeracs as well. I found a good one at the French 75

    pressure must have been too much!"

    but it was the bar next to the pool, on the final morning, and the bartender there
    said that he didn't have what it took to make a Sazerac. So I missed out on that
    particular peak experience.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I've finally posted a
    bit of reminiscence about TypeCon 2011: http://johndberry.com/blog/2011/07/20/typecon-surges-ahead/\r\n\r\nI
    suspect that everyone who was there had to take a little while to decompress and
