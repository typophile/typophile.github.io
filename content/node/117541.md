  body: "Sorry Don, I don't see that. The 't' is a contemporary Gothic style, similar
    to that used in [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet|House Chalet 1980]]. I
    know Chalet is newer than the sample, but it is based on older designs that were
    probably photo-lettering types.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Trade Gothic Ext, with width at 110% with phototype era style edits.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TradeGothicExtW110pctWithEdit_4849.jpg]\r\nIn
    my opinion it was well within the ability of the photo lettering people to whip
    up a custom version of these letters from Trade Gothic Ext at this width. \r\nFor
    _t_, use _u_, deleting the rhs vertical stroke and adding an adjusted version
    of the crossbar from the old _t_.\r\nFor _r_ use _n_, deleting the rhs vertical
    stroke and part of the top curve\r\nTighten the spacing so that the curved strokes
    on new _t_ and new _r_ overlap _e_.\r\nTo settle the matter, it would be worth
    while to check though the photo-lettering stock sans fonts offered in 1970 to
    see if they had one like this.\r\nDon"
