    and Sassoon. Or like a non-existent Sauna Slab. Not very helpful, I know."

  body: "I love the look of that font. I just wonder, would I still like it five years
    from now. I find as time goes on, my taste changes, and few things I actually
    bought years ago would I care to even try and find in my files.\r\n\r\nI think
    I'd still like my Blambot purchases, and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/erehwon-roman-nf/erehwon-roman-nf/|Erewhon
    by Nick Curtis]], but not too many others come to mind."
