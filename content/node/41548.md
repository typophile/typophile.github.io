body: "hi all,\r\n\r\ni noticed on the front page a question mark set in Borges Titulo
  - it\r\nseems to be of the general form where the upper part wants to shoot off\r\ninto
  never-neverland rather than curling back down.\r\n\r\nit reminds me of the one in
  Scala Sans - my main disappointment/irritation\r\nin an otherwise great typeface.\r\n\r\ndoes
  anyone know about this kind of question mark? is this style part of\r\na general
  class of question mark designs? does it have a name?\r\nwhat is the history of it
  or inspiration for that form?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\njarrod\r\n"

    doesn't it.\r\n\r\nI know of no terminology for this. It is somewhat like the
    ampersand, another character where a designer can have a bit of fun with the character
    shape, as long as he/she does not go too far. (And I don't think that the Borges
    example is _too_ far out)."

  body: What Pattyfab said. Stempel Schneidler's question mark weakens the whole typeface.
