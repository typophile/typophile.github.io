  years or so) in FontLab, mostly on the Mac side; and am now working on a font that
  hopefully will be completely Unicode compliant, and I'm new to VOLT. One problem
  I've run into, in using VOLT to create some GPOS look-ups--quite simple look-ups,
  it seems to me--is that it proofs fine in the VOLT compile > proofing tool, but
  works erratically in different word-processors/software. So, for instance, creating
  a simply GPOS such as a macron over a cap R will currently work just fine in Mac
  OS X's TextEdit, but not in Word XP, Mellel (Mac OS X), InDesign, etc. \r\n\r\nI'm
  generating the font outlines in FontLab; generating a TrueType font; sending it
  to a PC to use VOLT; \"shipping\" the TrueType font back out of VOLT. Any suggestions
  about what I might be missing? or is GPOS badly supported?"

  body: I'm assuming you're implementing those GPOS lookups in the 'mark' and 'mkmk'
    features. On the InDesign side, only CS3 and up will support that stuff. But be
    aware that both ID CS3 and CS4 have some bugs in that area.

  body: "That's correct: GPOS using \"mark.\" Without doing a full new composite glyph
    creation and then using GSUB to make R + macron point to the composite glyph,
    is there another way to do this. We're aiming at a project that will be both print
    and web, so would like to do as little composite glyph creation as possible. \r\n\r\nAny
    comments on whether FrameMaker 8 supports GPOS?\r\n"

  body: "There's a pretty good reference chart at http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support
    showing which apps support which OpenType features. It's slightly out of date
    in that it doesn't list Adobe CS4 apps, but it is still quite useful and reasonably
    accurate. TextEdit is not listed, but my own testing suggests that the 'mark'
    feature is not supported there, so it's probably not a great test app. Mellel
    (2.2+) does support 'mark' as well as 'mkmk' so may give better results, but actually
    Microsoft's NotePad app is the best place to test VOLT work, outside of VOLT.\r\n\r\nAs
    to your specific issue: could you post a screen capture of the VOLT Script ->
    LangSys -> Feature -> Lookup tree (the leftmost pane of the main VOLT window)?
    Perhaps there's something awry there.\r\n"

    <em>We\u2019re aiming at a project that will be both print and web</em>\r\n\r\nAFAIK,
    currently no browser supports 'mark'. You'll need to do something Flash-based
    (targeted at FlashPlayer 10, at least).\r\n\r\n> <em>Any comments on whether FrameMaker

    certainly does not support 'mark'."
