  body: "<em>The sad thing is that companies and governments standardized use of the
    PUA could have the effect of creating a defacto standard on the PUA</em>\r\n\r\nThat
    was a worry, but companies and governments have been trying to do that to the
    PUA for over a decade now, and as far as I can tell the wild west has yet to be
    tamed. The Chinese government has been the biggest player in this regard, even
    incorporating PUA characters into de jure national standards documents, but the
    fact that any other government, company or individual can define contrary encodings
    for the same PUA codes prevents any overall de facto standard from emerging. The
    Chinese can demand that any software conformant with their standard use the PUA
    in a particular way, but that hardly challenges the essential nature of the PUA:
    Practically Unusable Anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe really scary thing is when the Chinese
    start hijacking reserved characters in non-PUA ranges, as they want to do for
    a glyph encoding for (unnecessary) Uighur ligatures. They can't use PUA for that
    because all PUA characters have a presumed left-to-right order (see above, Unusable)."
