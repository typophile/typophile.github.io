  I ended up having to outline the fonts. Thomas Phinney once threatened to write
  a piece in his blog about them, but I remember checking and it never showed up.\r\nID
  CS2 stopped generating them, by and large, and now with CS3 it seems that all the
  fonts are encoded this way.\r\nCan anyone explain what a CID encoded font is? Is
  this something that is still going to cause me problems?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\npbc"

    and it might not fully answer your question. Still, here\u2019s a link: <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/13023\">Why
    is InDesign CS converting fonts into CID?</a>.\r\nCurious about further information,
    too.\r\nF"

    But now it's back in full force with CS3. Weird. Bert in that other thread says
    this has been remedied by CS2 (which I found to be largely true). But now it has
    been \"un-remedied\".\r\nI have just been experiencing some funny behavior on
    my computer and it feels like fonts are at fault so I have been looking into it.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "This from Dov Isaacs over on the Adobe ID board:\r\n<cite> Unfortunately,
    some third party (i.e., non-Adobe) PostScript and PDF software either doesn't
    implement CID-encoding or improperly does so. However, using Distiller to create
    PDF contrary to popular belief does not preclude CID-encoded fonts from appearing
    in the resultant PDF files. </cite> \r\n\r\n<cite>Note that all PDF/X standards
    and Ghent PDF Workgroup best-practice PDF guidelines and standards support CID
    font encoding and PDF exported directly from InDesign. </cite>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    I can't possibly have a relationship with all the printers I use so this may become
    a problem. We shall see\u2026\r\n\r\npbc\r\n\r\n"
