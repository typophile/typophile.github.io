body: can you tell what sans this is on the album cover? sorry it&#39;s so small,
  it&#39;s the biggest one i could find. probably something so basic i&#39;ll be shamed?
  and how about throw me a bone guys, a trick for the aspiring identifier? <BR>&#40;why
  do i feel like i&#39;m going to be told many many hours and pairs of glasses..&#41;

    pulls a 4 minutes type ID! and is welcomed in the hallowed halls of the Typophile
    Type ID Hall of Fame. <BR> <BR>My hat&#39;s off to you, Mr. Hubner. Well, actually

  body: 'Monospace fonts are also irreplaceable when writing tablatures. &#40;Anyone
    plays the guitar here? :D&#41; <BR> <BR>for example: <BR> <BR>  e||------------------------------------------------------------------||
    <BR>  B||o--------------H--P--------S-------------------------------------o||
    <BR>  G||--------------8-11-8------8-6---------------6---------6--8--------||

    <BR>  A||o------------------------------9------8--6---------8-------------o||
    <BR>  E||------------------------------------------------------------------||
    <BR> <BR> <BR>Look how it all gets messed up when it&#39;s in proportional font:
    <BR> <BR>  e||------------------------------------------------------------------||
    <BR>  B||o--------------H--P--------S-------------------------------------o||
    <BR>  G||--------------8-11-8------8-6---------------6---------6--8--------||

    <BR>  A||o------------------------------9------8--6---------8-------------o||
    <BR>  E||------------------------------------------------------------------||
    <BR> <BR>And if you put lyrics with chord names above words, it gets even worse.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>How come that '
