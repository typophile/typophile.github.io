		<div class="commentbody">b2 is interesting but I don't think it really captures "properties" - it has more of a technology feel to it. b3 though seems intriguing enough. It has "architectural" elements that can be useful for a property investment firm. I'm not sure disconnecting the bowl of the "b" is the right approach though. Maybe think of this more in terms of buildings, architecture or even investment concepts. Right now it seems a bit too focused on the first letters of the company's name. Which is a perfectly fine place to start, but yeah, play with some other concepts. Hope this helps.</div>

So... it is B3 But need to be more architetural
I'll try to make it more like squares?
yeah.... I mostly either start with letters or a symbol... it makes a kind of steps to use :)

dezcom
What if I change the shape of circular B into 2 squares? wouldnt it be more... umm... easy on the eye?


epsilicon
people always say that my designs r nontraditional....I wish I can control this :(
should I try to make 4c work.... or it doesnt worh the effort?

Re: 4C - I think it needs to be simpler. It just has too much going on for it at the moment. Something like this perhaps (2 minute hack job):

Not necessarily like squares but have the letter-shapes almost feel like buildings or houses. Your designs need to invoke a feeling. Again I think you should explore different concepts beyond just the initials "FB". Maybe even think about cultural symbols from French and Bahrainian cultures (I'm assuming that the company is composed of people familiar with France and Bahrain). These designs right now just aren't clicking the "property investment button" in my mind.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with the other posting that your designs aren't giving off a properties and investments vibe. That said, to me 1B and 2B have the most potential in becoming interesting icons to be used with the name. 1B could stand to be abstracted even more (imo) and 2B currently reads as EB. You really should be working with the name as well as the mark to develop the two together. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm sorry, but none of those seem at all workable.  :-(

I'm trying to find some glimmer of meaning (as opposed to just fooling around with shapes) and the only thing I'm seeing is something in b2: is that a falcon? Because I know falconeering is big in the gulf states.

In any case, two important things to ask/answer: who is the typical client of this business? What kinds of buildings/properties do they build/manage?

falcon? I didnt mean to, but it looks well
yes .. i've got a falcon :)..... but what is the connection between falconeering & properties?

the company buys & sells properties, they invest in properties, serving big companies and regular indevituals

The building shapes that make up the falcon connect to the properties; the falcon connects to Bahrain. Plus people like falcons, especially these days since they contrast against sleazy human real estate agents. Fly with it!
