body: "Hello all :)\r\nI am doing a design update for a business mag and look for
  a new body copy face. The one used this far is Bitstreams Aldine401 (which would
  be a revival of Bembo of sorts), it is too thin. I need something that would at
  least distantly resemble it, but read better at long texts. Elegance is important
  :). The tricky part is that I need an OT face, with custom characters, ligatures,
  cyrillics, small caps, lc numbers, and all. \r\nSuggestions welcomed :)."

    Book Pro</a> seems the obvious thing, but I'm not sure if it has Cyrillics.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I don't think it does."

    Maiola Pro</a> looks nice too."

  body: I chose Adobe's Warnock Pro, as it is a little different, yet somehow delivers
    the about same text "color", without the fuss. And I am absolutely in love with
    the optical sizes. Thanks to all who are doing this great job :)).
