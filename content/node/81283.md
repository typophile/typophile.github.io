  hoping someone will be generous enough to be patient with me! I also apologize if
  this was brought up before; I searched and could find nothing so please point me
  in the right direction if it has! \r\n\r\nI'm fairly new to typography and design.
  To make a long story short, I was digging around the glyph palette of Apple Chancery
  and stumbled across these: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/applechanceryglyph_3719.png]\r\n\r\nMy
  name's Alexa. These look to me like my initials, so pardon me but I suppose I've
  become a little spooked!\r\n\r\nA. Are these specific glyphs with a meaning or just
  swash caps?\r\n\r\nB. In InDesign at least, when I hover over these glyphs in the
  palette, they're named \"null\". A lot of characters are, actually. Is there a way
  to identify these in the future besides posting them here? \r\n\r\nPlease guide\u2014or
  shove if you'd rather\u2014me in the right direction. Thank-you!"

  body: They're swash variants of standard characters. The reason they show up in
    the glyph palette as "null" is because there are no standard Unicode values for
    swash characters, and names are not required by the TrueType format.

  body: "They are swash versions of \"a\" and \"l\" (lowercase L). If you use the
    font in a \"Cocoa\" app, such as TextEdit, open the Fonts window and select \"Typography\"
    from the little \"gear\" pop-up near the bottom left, you can see that there are
    several swash and alternate versions:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/texteditswash_4742.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
    you enable the Character Viewer (from the Keyboard preferences in the System Preferences
    app), you can see all the different forms available for each basic character (such
    as lowercase L):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/characterviewer_5770.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut,
    since Apple Chancery is an AAT (Apple Advanced Typography) font, not an OpenType
    font, InDesign doesn't recognize any of this. AAT is an extension of TrueType
    that preceded OpenType. It can do similar things (like swashes and alternates),
    but only works on Macs. It's probably because it's not cross-platform compatible
    that Adobe doesn't do much to support it in InDesign and their other apps.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    you can use the Character Viewer to insert these special characters into an InDesign
    document."

  body: "Well I certainly didn't even know that about text/edit, thank-you! That's
    useful. Interestingly though on my system that particular glyph doesn't show up
    as an alternate for L. It does for the A. I'll just file that under software oddities
    and try to forget about it though. \r\n\r\nThanks much for entertaining a possibly
    over-enthusiastic student digging around in the character palettes and such!"

    may be why it's not showing up on your system. \r\n\r\nIn any case, any characters
    you see in InDesign's glyph palette can be inserted into your text at the cursor
    position by double-clicking in the glyph palette."
