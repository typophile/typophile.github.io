body: "The popular practice of creating a new typeface that closely hews to existing
  designs. Famous revivals include the various 20th century interpretations of the
  types of [[Claude Garamond]], generally bearing his name; [[Bruce Roger]]'s [[Centaur]],
  a revival of [[Nicolas Jenson]]'s types; and [[Helvetica]], a revival of turn of
  the century [[grotesk]]s such as [[Akzidenz Grotesk]]. The difference between \"revival\"
  and \"plagiarism\" is mainly a matter of acknowledging one's influences; revivals
  are controversial within typographic circles precisely because they bespeak a lack
  of imagination on the part of the designer. At the same time, waves of revivals
  typically accompany each new typesetting technology, as typographers try to replace
  beloved favorites from earlier generations of technology. Much of digital typography
  has revolved around revivals when there hasn't been outright piracy of existing
  designs.\r\n\r\nThe term is also fairly flexible, encompassing not only close copies
  of existing designs. Therefore [[Stanley Morison]]'s [[Times New Roman]] can be
  said to be a revival of [[Plantin]] types, and [[Zuzana Licko]]'s personal and idiosyncratic
  [[Filosofia]] can be called a revival of [[Bodoni]]."
