		<div class="commentbody">For all of those who are cheap and/or poor like myself and the price of the Hotel Nikko is keeping you away &#40;even with the great reduced rate&#41;, in a quick bit of research I&#39;ve found a few hostels in very close proximity to the Hotel Nikko from this site: <a href="http://www.hostels.com/us.ca.sf.html" target="_blank">http://www.hostels.com/us.ca.sf.html</a> <BR> <BR>The HI-San Francisco-Downtown &#40;Union Square&#41; is one block away from the conference and is $24/night for the very minimum of necessities and the Adelaide Hostel/Hotel isn&#39;t too much further.  I can&#39;t vouch for either of these, but I&#39;m almost positive that this is how I&#39;ll be staying in the city. <BR> <BR>It&#39;ll be my first TypeCon, I know I&#39;m not usually very vocal on the forums, but I read from them every day and I&#39;m really looking forward to putting faces with all the names and meeting lots of people. <BR> <BR>Seeya there!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey, gang, just a reminder: early registration is over end of day June 9 &#40;Wed&#41;. Now is the time to save! The FontLab workshop on Wed., July 21 is full, but, thanks to the kind hearts of Ted Harrison and Adam Twardoch, we were able to add a second session on Thursday. Ken Barber&#39;s Locking Down Lockups workshop is also full. The Education Forum is nearing capacity as well. 19 other workshops, but many are filling quickly. The Nikko rooms are going fast... y&#39;all better hurry up and register if you&#39;re coming to TypeCon!</div>
