  I can guess most of these, but it would be nice to have this broken out by style
  (bold and itlaic) and not just family. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

    sites (according to this http://www.alexa.com/topsites) and they mostly seem to
    use Arial, Arial Bold and Tahoma and Tahoma Bold. But I''m sure this isn''t representative
    of the wider web. '

    enough memory for all the fonts we ship in full OS''s so I''m looking to provide
    a prioritized list based in part in actual usage. '

    | Code Style]] has a pretty complete (and ongoing) survey of Web fonts - in fact,
    it''s the best around. Their recent (April 11, 2009) [[http://www.codestyle.org/css/font-family/sampler-WindowsResultsFull.shtml
    | Full Windows font survey results]] are fascinating, if not incredible: Franklin
    Gothic Medium is on 97.62% of surveyed Windows machines? Gill Sans MT is on about
    half of all surveyed Windows machines?'

  body: "Thanks, yes I'm familiar with that one. However it doesn't seem to relate
    to the popularity of fonts specified on Web pages. \r\n\r\nRe. Franklin Gothic
    Medium - that is a core UI font in Windows XP, that stuck around. Gill Sans however
    most likely got installed with Office. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n"
