  to do a poster and the font they found that they like I identified has Farnham Display.
  But we can't afford to buy this font. Are there any other more common fonts or cheaper
  alternatives that will give us the same look?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nsorry if this
  is the wrong place, I wasn't sure where to post :)"

    There are freeware serif faces, but the choice is quite limited if you want a
    certain quality.

    Are you using PC or Mac? \r\n\r\nA very nice freeware serif is Tallys:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/tallys.html\r\n\r\nAlso
    look into a font called Gentium:\r\n\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium_design\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    I can't believe you have a business and don't have some kind of choices that came
    bundled with the programs you own. (always check the CDs)\r\n\r\nIf you do a lot
    of non-profit work, consider the Softmaker XXL cd. It has a ton of fairly decent
    fonts for a relatively small sum."
