body: "First of all, I discovered this web site by chance a few days ago, and realized
  what an immense and fascinating world this is! I think in another life I would like
  to study font design. I am redesigning a logo for a small law firm (mine). I don't
  want to use one of those heavy and distasteful fonts that law firms use, especially
  I don't want anything encased in one of those horrible squares that law firms tend
  to use to show that they are \"reliable, trust-worthy and institutional\". Since
  the name I chose for the law firm is one single, made-up word that could have more
  than one meaning, I decided to focus entirely on the font, and leave the corporate
  identity up to the evocative effect of the name. The logo is just going to be the
  corporate name, blue font. I like sans fonts, and I hate everything that is not
  plain and essential. So, I was thinking of using Futura, but the results of an internal
  poll (family and friends in the corporate world) seemed to point toward something
  with less of an edge and more \"comfy\" - such as Gill Sans. Someone suggested Century
  Gothic, saying that given the firm's very unusual name and the fact that none of
  the letters is emphasized (all LC except for the first letter of the name) it's
  a cool effect. Any thoughts on this would be really appreciated!\r\n"

    is a serif. I know you said you like sans fonts, but if there were two doors each
    with a lawyer name on it, I have more implicit trust in a guy whose name looks
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/hightower/\">traditional</a>
    and <a href=\"https://monokrom.no/fonts/satyr\">sophisticated</a> rather than
    edgy and easy-going. I wouldn't mess with well-entrenched preconceptions."

  body: "You're going about this the wrong way. A logo should reflect the personality
    of the business it represents, yet we know virtually nothing about you or your
    law firm. Nor can we pick a font that works well with your firm's particular name
    since we don't know what it is.\r\n\r\nI know you mentioned some of your personal
    preferences regarding fonts, but I think you're better off describing what qualities
    you're trying to communicate and let folks here make suggestions."

  body: "First of all, thank you all for your input. James, that's a good point. It's
    a business law firm, and mostly targeting clients establishing US operations.
    The personality of the firm is very informal, practically oriented \"let's sit
    down and talk business\", which does not mean tasteless, though. \r\nWith regard
    to sans, this http://www.linklaters.com/pages/index.aspx is one of the most famous
    law firms for business law, yet they use it. Or maybe specifically because of
    that, they can afford to use it, whereas if you are not their size you should
    not go off the beaten path?\r\n"

  body: 'Chris: I get the concept of not going to church wearing a swimsuit, so to
    say. However, it seems to me that - especially in the corporate / business world,
    nowadays - there are various degrees of stiffness / casualness. Take the VC world,
    for example, attorneys don''t even wear a suit, sometimes. I try to put myself
    into the client''s shoes - not wondering if they like the logo, in that you are
    right - but wondering what kind of gut-feeling they would get from it. What I
    would like to communicate is dinamic, flexible, unpretentious and down to earth,
    and business minded. Having said that, those were my first attemps, but based
    on the general poll here (quite negative on the whole sans serif), I think I am
    going to try some different fonts... '

    Ask the client what <strong>they</strong> want to communicate, to whom, and to
    what end. Write this down, and get them to sign-off on it as a formal starting
    point. Go from there, and when you present your concepts, clearly state you have
    based your decisions on the criteria they signed-off on. If they throw in a few
    more things, you say \u201C<em>I can do that, however, that was not something
    we discussed previously, as seen on this document (show them their signature).
    In order to revisit this, it will take me X hours, and cost an addition $X</em>.
    How would you like to proceed?\u201D As lawyers, they should respect this. If
    not, they are hypocrites, and probably going to be a lousy client. \r\n\r\nAnd
    just out of curiosity, what is the budget for this job? Do the lawyers work for
    free? As high priced professionals, their asking someone to work for free is flat
    out disrespectful (and again, hypocritical). Not to mention how working for free
    undermines the integrity of the profession, while simultaneously jeopardizing
    the livelihood of other designers.\r\n\r\nBefore you talk budget, ask them what
    their hourly rate is. That will provide you with an excellent segue."

    go beyond the subjective.\r\n\r\nI am presently doing design work for my struggling
    farm friends in exchange for vegetables. And I am constantly helping them make
    objective decisions regarding their communication strategies. In many instances,
    what seems simple, obvious, and boring them, may in fact be a selling point. For
    example, a blight-resistant tomato, a new type of compost, a new tool that makes
    weeding easier &c. They have \u201Cfeelings\u201D about what they want to communicate,
    or accomplish, for example, attract more CSA (community shared agriculture) members.
    Thats where the designer comes in. I provide them with strategies to do so which
    often go far beyond their gut or unarticulated feelings, and they freely and graciously
    acknowledge this every time.\r\n\r\nI believe you and I are on the same page."
