  body: I believe the EU put together <a href="http://www.euro.gouv.fr/pratique/symbole.htm">their
    own specifications</a> for a logotype for the [[Euro]] symbol.

  body: "The Euro symbol is an abomination which shouldn't be used \"as is\" in text
    setting -- actually in <em>any</em> setting. Use the euro symbol provided with
    the typeface you are using.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful official Euro symbol can be found
    in [[Adobe]]'s Euro Sans Regular which you can <a href=\"http://store.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=48&platform=Macintosh\"
    target=\"new\">download for free</a>."

  body: I'm designing a sans at the moment, kind of geometric, and shocked myself
    by actually using the Euro template, exactly, for creating the symbol in the regular
    weight.

  body: "I am sorry, but I would like to know the name of the font used for the 'Euro'
    bank-note. Not informations about the 'Euro' logo.\r\nMaybe that the typeface
    used in 'Euro' bank-notes is Frutiger? Or?"

    like Frutiger!
