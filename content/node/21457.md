  to work, but can't seem to manage. Any suggestions?

  body: "Yes Stephen, thank you. Although I was hoping to find something with the
    same sort of simple geometric shapes, like the 45\xB0 lines, as in Matrix. I'm
    afraid I'm not very good at explaining this, but thank you all for trying."

  body: "Patty had the right idea with a search for \"latin\" fonts. These all have
    a pointed wedge serif. Here are <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=latin\">Latin
    fonts</a> at FontShop.\r\n\r\nWhere will it be used? Text or headlines? Do you
    need various weights and widths? Italic? There isn't a more complete latin family
    than Matrix."
