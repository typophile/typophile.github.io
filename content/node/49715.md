body: "I've got a few general workflow related issues that I'd love to get some advice
  on. Any help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI use FontLab 4 on Mac and the CS3 suite.
  I've customised a few typefaces directly in FontLab, but have always used illustrator
  to draw new ones, using various (hacked together) workarounds. \r\n\r\nThe last
  font I made (shown below) by opening an existing font, which was similar proportions,
  and copying and pasting my glyphs in, replacing the originals. This worked quite
  quickly and didn't require too much tweaking of the existing kerning. It was only
  after printing out some letters quite large that I realised nodes had been altered
  and some curves compromised during my copy/paste from illustrator. These were minor,
  but annoying and noticeable because it was an outline font.\r\n\r\nI do plan to
  start drawing directly in FontLab (is this the best option?) but have just created
  a typeface in illustrator that I would like to bring into FontLab. Because it is
  based on a complex grid (shown below), I created letters by using pathfinder to
  divide the grid into segments which I could then select and unite, quickly designing
  and keeping the perfect curves. Now I'm not sure what the best way to turn this
  into a font is. Redrawing on top of a grid in FL seems time consuming and inexact,
  is there a better way to work that will be quick and preserve my nodes/curves?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Grace_5192.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typeface_5809.jpg]"

    but any other help would be appreciated.

    Illustrator can drop dead. I'm still holding up the Freehand brigade!\r\n\r\nI
    heard a rumor it's better to draw up the glyphs in Fontographer, and then slink
    your sexy font over to FontLab to exploit it's high-octane scripting, kerning,
    classing etc. Any truth?"

    it up if you have been drawng in Illustartor but once you do you won't look back.\r\n\r\nThere
    are enough things to worry about when you are designing fonts without the complications
    of dragging things between different applications.\r\n\r\n"

    handling. I think you will do the same :)

  body: "I'm inclined to agree, for logotypes and such I will ultimately fall back
    upon freehand, but when it comes to making numerous glyphs, the nature of FL makes
    it the correct tool for the job.\r\nI do love the way the absolute grid works,
    The handles and points system is pretty spectacular. I need to find all the various
    buttons I need tho, things like punch and union I miss fiercely.\r\n\r\nHehe,
    and path direction had me proper flummoxed for a whole evening not so long ago.\r\nLeslies
    book helps greatly, I recommend that purchase. It's lighter than the manual too

  body: Not *sure* that this is the solution for you, but you could try saving/exporting
    from illustrator as SVG format. I had good results importing SVG into FontForge
    (haven't tried it with FontLab).

  body: "Thanks for the feedback! Now that I have FL5 I'm definitely going to try
    to get my head around it properly and start drawing in it from scratch.\r\n\r\nIt
    was more this new font that I specifically wanted advice on. As you can see from
    the second image, it's all constructed from segments of circles. In Illustrator,
    creating it by dividing the grid and then uniting sections means the perfect curves
    are preserved, every one has the same radius. How can I keep this mathematical
    level of perfection in FL?"

  body: "Jake, \r\n\r\nplease read the Illustrator-related section of the FontLab
    Studio manual. It explains how to optimize the process of moving your outlines
    from Illustrator to FontLab Studio. The basic principle is that in outline fonts
    (as supported by FontLab Studio) all points must be on an integer coordinate grid,
    and that 1 pt in Illustrator corresponds to 1 font unit in FontLab Studio. In
    other words, make sure that you have a grid in Illustrator every 1 pt, and that
    all your points are placed on that grid. Then you should be able to transfer your
    artwork to FontLab Studio without problems. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab

    of the manual and I've also ordered Leslie's book. Is this something that has
    changed since FL4.5? I was working in <a href=\"http://haikumonkey.net/?p=42\">this</a>
    fashion which takes into consideration sizing, but I don't think talks about points
    being aligned to the grid."

    I had earlier read about and it's working well, I've only had to slightly modify
    a couple of nodes to hit grid co-ordinates. \r\n\r\nIf I don't move them in Illustrator,
    will they automatically be bumped to the nearest co-ordinate when I paste them
    into FL anyway?\r\n\r\nThanks again."
