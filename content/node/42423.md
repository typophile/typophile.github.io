  body: "PLAYSOCCER looks like Helvetica 77, maybe 87, but I can't really tell because
    of the low resolution, and if this is the resolution of the logo, I doubt anyone
    will be able to tell if you change the font slightly. Also, I couldn't find this
    logo in use online in the Google searches, so maybe nobody even knows it exists.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think it really makes sense to do much to the other logo as it's the official
    logo. If nobody can figure out the font, you could play with a higher-resolution
    version of that official logo, like the one [[http://www.aysostore.com/|here]]"
