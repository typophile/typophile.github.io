  body: "@ J. Weltin:\r\nAesthetics aside, though, it appears that the Vanquish does
    not use ordinary tires, but instead requires special tires that rest on a larger
    wheel, which are no doubt more expensive.\r\n\r\nOf course, that is unlikely to
    be a significant concern for those in that car's intended market.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Checking at a site called \"Size My Tire\", the Vanquish tires have an aspect
    ratio of 40%; this was shared by the first other type of car that I checked, a
    Chevrolet Corvette, although a Ford Econoline van had tires with an aspect ratio
    of 75%.\r\n\r\nI hadn't realized there were so many different sizes of tire; I
    had thought there were only a very few standard sizes, one for cars, and bigger
    ones for trucks and buses.\r\n\r\nBut the rear tires on a Vanquish are wider than
    the front tires, which prevents normal tire rotation."

    cars than the supercar class with which the thread began.\r\n\r\nCraig, while
    the subject of cars is categorically off-topic, I'd argue that getting a sense
    of the kind of cars that appeal to people who are also typophiles isn't any more
    off-topic than any other kind of design. Insofar as type design can be considered
    a branch of industrial design -- Briem first suggested to me this when he visited
    us in Vancouver many years ago --, this topic could be considered more on-topic
    than the graphic design talk here. Type and automobiles both have functional jobs
    to perform that are in part independent of their aesthetics (although their beauty
    may result from features that make them, respectively, more readable or more aerodynamic)."
