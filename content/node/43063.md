  on a typeface to put under photographs to be displayed at an exhibit.  \r\n\r\nThe
  images (nature/landscape) are approximately 13x19 and wanted to add a few words
  on where/when the picture was taken (e.g. Yellowstone, January 2008).  \r\n\r\nI
  was looking for a script/calligraphy fontface that resembles a handwriting style;
  something like John Handy from LinoType ( I find John Handy a bit too hard.)\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/886/johnhandyscript-family.html\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone share any suggestions as to suitable types?\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: "Just a thought, but I would consider something very neutral that could be
    read from a distance. Consider the job the type needs to do. You want people to
    get the info and not have to crowd or get too close, and you don't want to make
    the labels large to compensate for a difficult to read script.\r\n\r\nIf you want
    some warmth go with Myriad. "

  body: "Thanks for your suggestion.  I am not sure about Myriad...  it sure is clear
    and warm, but my intent here is to replace handwriting (I wish I could write nicely
    as some people).  Also, the writing will go right below the photo right-centered.
    \ \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I don't want the typeface to detract attention from
    the main point of interest: the photo)."
