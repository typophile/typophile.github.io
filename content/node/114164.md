  body: "GT Walsheim looks like a general match except for M which I suspect was edited
    for the brand logo \"MARTINA SPERL\" \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GTWalsheimInUse_6603.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MartinaSperlLogo_5465.jpg]\r\nMay
    also be be using a condensed version of the font. Compare a Martina Sperl label
    \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MartinaSperlLabel_5486.jpg]\r\nwith GT
    Walsheim\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GTWalsheimInUse2_5892.jpg]\r\nInfo

    customized for Martina Sperl's brand identity. \r\n\r\nI suppose that still is
    the closest typeface match though?\r\n\r\nC."
