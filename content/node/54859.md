body: "Hi there!\r\nMy name is Laure Afchain, I'm currently studying in the Type]Media
  master in the Hague.\r\nI just wanted to share with you some good news from a french
  type design project I was involved in:\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of 2009, the city
  of Toulouse, in France, has a brand new typeface, named Garonne. Toulouse is actually
  the first french city to get its own exclusive typeface. Garonne is a type system
  which contains four fonts: a regular and its italic for the running text, an ultra-bold,
  and a condensed version dedicated to display. It will be soon used by the municipality
  on its logo, publications, posters, invitations, newspapers.\r\n\r\nWe've been designing
  it during my fourth and fifth year in the visual communication department of the
  Fine Arts School in Toulouse. To be more precise, it has been designed by <a href=\"http://www.pampatype.com\">Alejandro
  Lo Celso</a>, <a href=\"http://www.francoischastanet.fr\">Fran\xE7ois Chastanet</a>,
  G\xE9raud Soulhiol and <a href=\"http://www.lo-circonflexe.fr\">me</a>\r\n\r\nHope
  it will have a nice \"avenir\" :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Garonnes_3810.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/GaronneCharSet_5000.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/GaronneA_6285.jpg]"

    this one has a definite French feel to it. Well done.

  body: What's the deal with the top connection on the bowl of your regular "a"? This
    look amazing. Love the "y". Have you considered adding an alternate "G" and perhaps
    "k"?

    Steve; but I also see quite a bit of Alejandro (and thus perhaps a hint of Argentina)
    in it. See also www.pampatype.com -- Arlt. Which in turn was probably influenced
    a bit by Jannon and French Baroque (perhaps via Frantisek Storm).\r\n\r\nNot meant
    as any criticism or disparagement. Garonne looks very nice. I hope it is well
    received by the local community.\r\n\r\n"

    that is?\r\n\r\nI was going to say that it vaguely reminds me of letterforms in
    art nouveau, which I associate with France. Originally I thought it was the roundness,
    together with greater weight on the top of the glyph, but I think there's more
    to it than that.\r\n\r\nNice.\r\n\r\nBut maybe you were thinking something totally
    different when you said it has a \"French feel.\"\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Congrats for this beautiful project!\r\nJust to be a bit more precise, Toulouse
    is not the first French city to get a custom design. Franck Jalleau did a type
    family for the city of Brive-la-Gaillarde back in 2002.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typographe.com/article/565/IN-Brive\r\n\r\nNow
    that this truly great part of work is done, what really counts is how the typeface
    will be used by the mayor's offices. And this has obviously been a big issue for
    Brive. I have documents coming from them that still burn my eyes.\r\n\r\nBy the
    way, I'm always curious as to which extend a typeface design can claim itself
    being \"collaborative\". Could you tell a bit more about the design process?"

  body: 'I''m with Kent on this one. And possibly Hubert, if by coco-rico he means
    rococo - in the roman at least. The italic looks straight out of the dutch school
    - see quadraat italic. I admire Lo Celso''s work, and his influence here is no
    exception. Heaps of character, yet functional. Congratulations... I''m envious
    of your learning experience and of the people of Tolouse!  '
