body: "A week ago I got a project from a client in which I have to complete a design
  that was started by another designer. My client really likes the fonts and wants
  me to use the same one for the rest of the project. They only have a jpeg copy of
  the design. I do not have a clue what is the name of these fonts and I tried every
  where and last time I had a meeting with the client they said that the previous
  designer worked at a sign writing company so I\u2019m thinking maybe they have them
  available on their programs, if you can help me recognize the font it would be greatly
  appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you\r\n"

    which it is. Maybe it's some custom typography, but would please me to know at
    least of which has been based. Look at the "g" or "fi". Thanks to all and please
    help me. Thanks again by
