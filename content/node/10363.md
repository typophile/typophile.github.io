  body: I was thinking if some type designers are available to design custom fonts
    and sell them to a foundry who pay for own those works. I think its a good way
    of work but i dont know examples of designers selling fonts this way.. <BR> <BR>Any
    example?

  body: This is not unusual. Sometimes these are typefaces commissioned by the foundries,
    or in other cases they are sold to the type foundry after the fact, <BR> <BR>In
    our case, Adobe used to operate largely on a royalty basis, but for business and
    legal reasons has recently moved more towards a fully-paid-up-front model. <BR>

  body: "I am unsure of the 'rules' for this forum.  If I'm breaking any, would someone
    please let me know---\r\n\r\nI own a digital art image, scrapbook, inspirations,
    consignment store. All of our artists and designers own all rights to their works.
    We offer a store front where these designers can place their products for sale
    under the Angel Policy. This policy allows customers to purchase our product,
    download it to their computer, print and create crafts and paper items in tangible
    format and sell the product in craft fairs, stores, online or off. (Our Angel
    Policy does not allow the customer to create a derivative work and sell or distribute
    it in digital or downloadable format. Only paper and tanbible handcrafted items
    can be made and sold (in tangible format only) by our customers).\r\n\r\nI am
    looking for font designers who are interested in selling their True Type Fonts
    subject to our angel policy at my site: http://daisiecompany.com\r\n\r\nI am also
    looking for AlphaBets (Graphic Alphabets and Numbers with a few punctuation marks:
    ! @ # ? ~ { }. \r\nThese alphabets are not true type fonts. They can be sold to
    our customers under the Angel Policy, for the purpose of making word art and background
    papers for personal use only.\r\n\r\nThe Angel Policy for fonts means that your
    fonts could be used for personal items only. This means that the customer purchases
    the right to type words onto their craft projects, and scrapbook layouts. The
    Angel Policy would not allow them to distribute the font in any other format than
    printed onto their handmade item. No commercial use of fonts is allowed under
    this policy.\r\n\r\nAlso, looking for a commercial use agreement with font designers,
    as I would like to incorporate fonts into my word art, overlays and papers. It
    would be a great way for font designers to make some real money, retain all rights,
    rather than selling the fonts or contracting a small percentage licensing arrangement.\r\n\r\nPayment
    is made biweekly and the percentages paid to the designers/artists/ font designers
    for products sold is better than 50%\r\n\r\nFont designers can offer a multiple
    font bundle and sell them as a set of scrapbook fonts. We are looking for everything
    from cute fonts, elegant script to grunge block lettering.\r\n\r\nTo submit, type
    your alpha into a word doc, and include your name and email address. Send an email
    with your attached word doc to ginajane@daisiecompany.com.\r\n\r\nI would love
    to hear from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** gina jane ***\r\n\r\nhttp://www.daisiecompany.com\r\n\r\n'relationships
    are the greatest art'\r\n\r\n"
