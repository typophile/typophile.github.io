		<div class="commentbody">For clarity&#39;s sake, let&#39;s define a &#34;mark&#34; as a non-type graphic with or without accompanying logo type, &#34;type&#34; as a written/typed out name without a graphic, and ignore the merging element of a &#34;typemark&#34; &#40;i.e. monogram&#41; to avoid confusion. <BR> <BR>I believe the type or size of a business or industry is irrelevant to whether or not a &#34;mark&#34; &#40;vs. type&#41; should be used to identify it. The process of designing an identity includes discovering a party&#39;s unique characteristics, relative to their industry and their goals/objectives, then capturing your findings in a mark or typographical logo. How can you assume one will work better than another without applying the design process to the individual project. <BR> <BR>I have only been pursuing self employment for about five months now, after spending seven years working for in-house corporate design groups. One of the greatest benefits I have found working on my own is that I have enough control over my projects to individualize each one of them, instead of regurgitating portions of old projects. In the corporate world, the statement &#34;don&#39;t reinvent the wheel&#34; is practically a chant. I understand the concept of not throwing out everything you have learned, but I believe the statement is often used as a copout to avoid going through the design grinder &#40;here design is used in its most general sense, as almost every discipline requires some form of design...see dictionary definition&#41;. It irritates me to hear or read that some designers are promoting what in my opinion is an unsubstantiated limitation to my control over individual design projects. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree, in general, with Zato and HD there. Most small/medium clients know they need a unique identity but only know how to ask for a &#34;logo.&#34; <BR> <BR>But when it comes to the actual design process I agree with Scott. I wouldn&#39;t rule either out without judging the merits of each, against the requirements of the project. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is an essay&#39;s topic. &#40;No, none is coming up right now.&#41; <BR> <BR>In general the quote says nothing wrong. If you don&#39;t have to say anything important: &#34;shut up&#34;. <BR> <BR>My bakery never told me someting intelligent, so their logo wouldn&#39;t tell me anything else &#40;ignoring that they don&#39;t really have one, since it&#39;s times not even arial&#41; <BR> <BR>But even me doesn&#39;t really care nor do the hundreds of people that also buy their bread there, if the CI of the bakery is good or not. <BR>as long as the bread is OK. <BR> <BR>To propose some philosophic thoughts: &#34;Do you really need need to design public space? Would you really like a totally designed world and public space arround you?  <BR> <BR>I know the thougts jump arround a lot, but I hope you understand the point I am aiming at. <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik <BR> <BR>P.S.: I agree that the variation in the field of using different typefaces could increase, but only if it fits to the company and its suroundings. <BR>&#40;Might be a bit idealistic, but there have to be some of those folks, too.&#41; <BR> <BR>P.P.S.: No this is no neglection of graphic design but not everone needs it, because most people would lie if they had a perfect image &#40;I couldn&#39;t deal with being approached nicely by the women working at my bakery &#40;this might by different in the USA&#41;. <BR> <BR></div>
