body: I am currently trying to put together graphic standards manuals for 7 different
  companies (they are all under the same corporate umbrella) These companies have
  been around for awhile, but no-one has created a standards manual until now. Many
  different people create documents for these companies, so I thought it would be
  best to stick to the lowest common denominator of the fonts available in Windows.
  I would like to pick appropriately though, and I am finding it difficult to find
  out the history of these windows fonts, what they were based on, and why they were
  created. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks!!

    would be to look at all the flavours of Windows they use, pick the common fonts,
    and try them out in the standard documents they produce, then create templates
    in whatever fonts pass the committee process.  :-(\r\n\r\nIf you feel you need
    to read about history <em>et al</em>, there are lots of books out there that can
    go into the details, but to be honest, 99.9% of clients and users don't want/need/care
    to know the \"wherefore\" or \"why,\" just the \"here's how to do this.\"\r\n"
