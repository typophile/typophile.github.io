  someone in the forum knows about transliteration habits in China and Japan when
  it comes to foreign brands and custom fonts.\r\n\r\nI know in Japan sometimes some
  sentences are designed to match a particular font or logo, but I am not totally
  sure about it. \r\n\r\nAre new custom fonts ordered by companies? Or is it such
  an expensive thing this is seldom done? How do they deal with Western corporative
  latin fonts? Do they match them with a similar looking japanese font? Or is it common
  to design a limited set of japanese characters to set only some sentences/words?
  \ \r\n\r\nAnd what is the situation in China? Do they proceed in the same way?\r\n\r\nMany
  many thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"
