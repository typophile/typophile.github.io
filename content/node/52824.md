body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm commissioning a font design for a Finnish higher education facility
  of 10k students that will be launched in 2010. Things are still in an early phase
  but progressing quite rapidly next year.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a skilled font designer
  / font foundry to design a custom type face. Possibly two, sans & serif. Work should
  be done between February and May 2009. Although we're looking for quality, price
  plays a role as well (surprisingly).\r\n\r\nIf you are interested or want more information
  contact me at: jussijokinen at iki dot fi\r\n"
