body: "Hello,\r\nI am new to this forum and hope you can help me: I am looking for
  the font that the Wall Street Journal Magazine uses for headlines and Sub-headlines.
  I already found out that they use Phaistos for some headlines and Verlag for body
  text. But I could never find the name of the third font they use. Here is a photo
  of a title page that uses it:\r\nhttp://www.theentertainmentlifestyle.com/2011/10/david-beckham-suits-up-on-wsj-magazine.html\r\n\r\nI
  also attach a rates/specs list that can be downloaded at their Media site. \r\n\r\nNote
  that it is the WSJ-Magazine, not the Journal itself.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance!\r\nBest\r\nTheo"

  body: "If you open the PDF with Acrobat or Adobe Reader, in one of the menus (it
    depends on the system), you will find the \"Properties\" item and there a \"Font\"
    tab that lists all fonts embedded in the document (wording could be a bit different
    since I\u2019m using the Italian version)."

  body: "You know, with the amount of people that constantly post type IDs in the
    wrong section you'd think that this forum could just switch it around a bit. It
    isn't very intuitive with the current setup and I've been confused by it before
    as well.\r\n\r\nJust a thought."

  body: It is very difficult to find all information about Pakistan at one place and
    I have run exhaustive search but could find appropriate stuff, however this website
    provides very good information and should be shared with all those looking for
    <a href="http://www.dostpakistan.pk/">Latest Information About Pakistan</a>.
