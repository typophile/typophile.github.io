  in new and revised versions at Myfonts. After the tragic end of the established
  Fountain Type Foundry I had to ask myself the following question: Is there still
  any justification for the existence of my 20 year old fonts?</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>by
  Felix Braden</em>\r\n\r\nAround the time of the millennium I founded the free font
  domain <a href:\"http://floodfonts.com\">Floodfonts</a>. I had just set up my own
  business with two friends, and to get press coverage and more exposure for our works,
  we decided to give away some of our type projects for free. We had hardly opened,
  when Peter Bruhn from Sweden asked us, if we would rather prefer to sell some of
  these fonts via <a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com>Fountaintype</a>. And of course
  we wanted to! Peter selected three of our ten fonts which we then extended to the
  standard character set of Fountain fonts. Peter supported us with corrections and
  helpful advice. For example he gave us a simple text document that I still use today
  \u2013 in an updated version \u2013 to do the kerning of all my typefaces. And after
  almost a year my typefaces Sadness and Grimoire were ready for release via Fountaintype.
  Unfortunately I met Peter only once, however I personally owe him very much, because
  he evoked the idea in me that type design could be much more than just a mere hobby.\r\n\r\nAfter
  Peter's sudden and unexpected death last year, I had to ask myself how to handle
  the situation with my typefaces. In memory of her husband Lotta Bruhn, Peter\u2019s
  wife, decided  not to remove the site from the internet, but she did not want to
  continue to operate the business. I very much liked the idea to honor Peters life
  and work but Sadness and Grimoire were created while I was still a student and are
  now almost 20 years old. Is there still any justification for their existence?\r\n\_
  \r\nIf people ask me, why I am obsessed by type design, I always make the point
  that it is so timeless. The Garamond typefaces from the 16th century are the most
  frequently used book typeface today; transferring that fact to other design disciplines,
  would mean that we wear a plate or leather armor and ride to work in a horse-drawn
  carriage. The idea that a design concept could persist over 500 years is a source
  of extraordinary fascination for me. Now don't get me wrong: I do not want to compare
  those groundbreaking designs with my own fonts. But in type design, the clocks tick
  differently and in comparison with Garamond's persistence for over half a century
  those 20 years  Grimoire and Sadness have been around are just a blink of the eye.\r\n\_
  \r\nSo I have decided to launch both aged fonts again with just slight adjustments.
  I do hope that people are still able to use them for highly contemporary design
  and I am curious how they will be incorporated.\r\n\_\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poster_01_Sadness_4975.png]
  \r\n\r\nSadness is based on some experiments during my stay at the Trier College
  of Design: I played around with Fontographer\u2019s blendfonts-feature (a type design
  tool to interpolate fonts and to minimize effort and expenditure of large families)
  with some files from a close designer. Since the basic elements derived from extremely
  varied fonts without any similarities, the concluding shapes first turned out to
  be rather fragmentary. From those fragments I chose the most characteristic elements
  and drew a whole new font.\r\n\_ \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poster_01_Grimoire_4097.png]\r\n\r\nGrimoire
  on the other hand combines two seemingly contradicting principles \u2014  calligraphic
  and constructive ideas \u2014 and makes them work together. The font is based on
  a modular system but simulates a handwritten typeface. I was so fascinated by this
  idea, that I have since designed a couple of typefaces following this principle,
  e.g. the psychedelic Bikini released by Volcanotype. Even my recent work, the multi
  awarded FF Scuba, is inspired by this concept, however with increasing age I have
  become less interested in experimental typography and  more so in designing typefaces
  which are more versatile in use.\r\n\r\nBoth typefaces, Grimoire and Sadness, are
  available at Myfonts with a introductory discount of 80% until May 19th 2015. You
  will find detailed type specimens of both fonts at Behance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poster_05_Sadness_4206.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poster_02_Sadness_4045.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poster_03_Sadness_5210.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poster_04_Sadness_5974.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poster_06_Sadness_6349.png]\r\n\r\nRelated
