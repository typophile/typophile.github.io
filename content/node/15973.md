  body: The second sample is definitely hand-drawn but there are a ton of fonts like
    that - try Housepaint from House http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=fontsbystyle&s=13
    or do a search for Brush at myfonts.com

    href=\"http://www.abstractfonts.com/fonts/static_Letters/D_4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dyer</a>
    - made to mimic the lettering on another Led Zep album cover.\r\nHarold Lohner's
    version of <a href=\"http://members.aol.com/fontner/virile.html\" target=\"_blank\">Virile
    Open</a>."
