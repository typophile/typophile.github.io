body: "(NOT \"french spacing\" as with \\frenchspacing.)\r\n\r\nThere are two things
  I should very much like to know. The first is probably simpler, but the second would
  be better.\r\n\r\n1. Is it possible to get english or french spacing around \"!\",
  \";\", \"?\", and \"!\" without selecting french as the language after whose rules
  words are split at the ends of lines, i.e. without \\selectlanguage{french} ?\r\n\r\n2.
  Is it possible to do this but also increase the space after the last period (or
  similar sign) in a sentence, e.g. to 1 em?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Yes, it's possible, but it's rather advanced.\r\n\r\nI would create a new
    language definition file for the babel package and copy the spacing rules for
    the characters you need from the frenchb.ldf file. Then you just load your new
    language file via babel: \\usepackage[norwegian2,french]{babel}. \r\n\r\nAs for
    the post-punctuation spacing, that's usually handled by means of a percentage,
    rather than an absolute value. So, to get \\frenchspacing after a period without
    specifying \\frenchspacing, do\r\n\r\n\\sfcode`\\\\.1000\r\n\r\nThis sets the
    spacing factor after a period to be 1. (For standard American typesetting, it's
    set to 3, i.e., \\sfcode`\\\\.3000.)\r\n\r\nIf you want additional help for any
    of this, feel free to contact me via email, and I would be glad to help.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for your help. Copying the code that seemed relevant in frenchb.ldf
    did not work, however, however, I was able to use ecclesiastic.sty, changing all
    occurrences of \"latin\" to \"danish\", as well as adding the following, to allow
    normal \"(?)\" and \"(!)\":\r\n\r\n\\useshorthands{(}\r\n\\defineshorthand{(?}{\\string(?}\r\n\\useshorthands{(}\r\n\\defineshorthand{(!}{\\string(!}\r\n\r\nAs
    regards the space between sentences, I do not want to merely to be a glue factor
    (or whatever), but an extra space, that is always visible and wonderfully archa\xEFc.
    Know how?\r\n\r\nNB! When I say french spacing, I mean the opposite of \\frenchspacing.
    I mean extra space before ?, !, :, and ;, as well as between sentences. Not the
    boring stuff that \\frenchspacing does. Possibly, this is more correctly referred
    to as english spacing."

    IIRC -- in some of his fonts, as a Stylistic Set.

  body: Thank you. This works fine, until I change the language with \selectlanguage.
    The value of \xspacefactor does not change, but for some reason, it will have
    no effect throughout the rest of the document. Any idea what might remedy this?
