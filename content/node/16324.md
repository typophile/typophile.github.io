  body: Although technically this isn't a "typeface" (this is an alphabet which was
    specifically produced for making carplates, and as such hasn't got an equivalent
    in other media), it strongly resembles DIN 1451 Mitteschrift. For an updated and
    expanded version of the DIN alphabet see [[FontFont]]'s FF DIN.

  body: It's something we say in Belgium (probably elsewhere as well) -- when two
    people say the same thing at exactly the same moment, in this case our replies
    which were basically identical and both listed at 04:01 PM.

    Yves. That's a new one on a 'Mercan boy like me :-)\r\nThank god I got it right
    though. You guys are so quick on this Type ID thing that by the time I adjust
    my trifocals well enough to read a post, you've got it answered and a link to
    the face as well! I can't even remember my wife's birthday :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    had to buy the jinxer a coke before he could speak again.

    Oh well\u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nI haven't said this phrase since I was in elementary
    school, probably 10 years ago. I see you're not a fan of Coke. I'd have to say,
    I enjoy it much more than Pepsi but don't really even drink soda that much anymore.
