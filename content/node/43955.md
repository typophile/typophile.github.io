  consisting of two pockets, one which contains the booklet and the other which contains
  a sleeve with the CD inside.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that I don't know the correct
  sizes (I've just been measuring a whole bunch of CD cases) and I can't seem to make
  it so the pocket fits the sleeve without making it too big for what seems like the
  standard size. This is fine it itself but it would seem to make it a potential annoyance
  for people wanting to put it in standard CD racks etc, not to mention retailers.\r\n\r\nMy
  question is: have you successfully made a cardboard CD case containing another sleeve
  which still manages to fit in standard racks? or Have you got any wisdom on sizes
  or Cardboard CD creation generally?\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n--N"

    rather than a ruler, to measure those CD cases.

    have templates for download that fits their working process.

  body: Other places do, this place doesn't really specialize in CD cases so they
    don't seem to have that kind of thing. Also this CD case is non-standard.

  body: "<em>Also this CD case is non-standard.</em>\r\n\r\nIn that case, you've sort
    of answered your own question about getting it to fit into a standard rack.  A
    survey of my collection for cardboard sleeve cases shows they are all just a light
    bristol board stock that match the height of a standard plastic case, and are
    otherwise square (with gluing tabs, of course). \r\n\r\nHave you looked at setting
    it up with a thicker spine to accommodate the brochure with a sleeve for the CD
    (open at either the spine or the fore edge)? Back in the good old days, Adobe
    used to ship out software in some really elegant all-cardboard constructions...."

  body: "One alternative, if you can spare some $$, is to buy a CD with a cardboard
    sleeve and then take it apart -- you'll get better measurements that way, if you're
    using a ruler. The first pressings of Cat Power's \"You Are Free\" had a cardboard
    sleeve like the one you want to make. It might be easier to find Sleater Kinney's
    \"The Woods,\" though. Aimee Mann's \"Bachelor No. 2\" has just a half-pocket
    for the booklet, but you can use the measurements of the other half.\r\n\r\nCheaper
    alternative: <a href=\"http://www.sleevetown.com/cardboard-cd-sleeve.shtml\">Sleeve
    City</a> will send you a sample of their cardboard sleeves for just a penny. They
    also state that their pocket measures 5 in. x 4-7/8 in.\r\n\r\nI'll try to post
    more later -- right now I have to go to work.  :-)"

  body: "Thanks guys, this is good advice. I'd love to know how Cat Power and Sleater
    Kinney do it, maybe a trip down to the CD store... (although it would hurt to
    buy a CD I didn't really want to own, I've tried with Cat Power really I have)
    \r\n\r\nThe printer is proposing a 230GSM board, to my mind that seems comparable
    to the bristol board. What I'd love would be a set of standard sizes for CDs that
    retailers can cope with. hm...\r\n\r\nthanks again guys"

  body: "Hey, Nicholas, I looked at my copy of <em>Forms, Folds and Sizes</em> to
    see if there were any CD templates, but no such luck.\r\n\r\nBut check this out...
    I just found some templates online:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.discwizards.com/cd-dvd-artwork-templates.htm\r\n\r\nhttp://www.duplication.ca/printspecs/1000.htm\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kyric.com/templates2/templates.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thecdduplicator.com/cd-sleeve-templates.html\r\n\r\nSo
    forget about Chan Marshall... Typing \"CD sleeve templates\" into Google does
    the trick.  :-)\r\n\r\nSeriously, maybe one of these templates will be helpful.
    Good luck!"

  body: Thanks Ricardo! So apparently we're not going with the inner sleeve cause
    it would be too fiddly, I guess that solves my problem, but this is great stuff
    thanks a lot. I did search for CD templates but I couldn't find one that had the
    double sleeve only basic wallets or digipaks etc. Cheers.
