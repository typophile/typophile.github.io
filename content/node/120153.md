body: I am trying to find a typeface suitable for the headings in a Sword and Sorcery
  themed book. Preferably quite a subtle take on the theme rather than lots of symbols
  etc. Thanks!

    something lombardic, like Goudy Medieval\r\n<li>Perhaps a pseudo-uncial like Aniron\r\n<li>Many,
    many blackletters to choose from</ul>\r\n\r\nOnce you narrow down the general
    feel you'd like a little bit, I'm sure you could get more constructive feedback."

    much subtle you want to go?\r\nIs something like Faunus/Satyr (http://monokrom.no/catalogue)
    too subtle?"

  body: Myself, I'd go for something more readable, but still old, like the Golden
    Type or one of the imitations like Jenson Oldstyle or Kelmscott.

  body: "Plenty of good suggestions here. Faunus is pretty subtle, though.\r\n\r\nRiffing
    on the Jenson Oldstyle / Kelmscott direction, one could also go with a more classic
    Jenson, such as\r\n\r\nCloister http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-cloister/\r\nCentaur
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/centaur/\r\nAdobe Jenson http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/jenson/\r\n\r\n\u201CSword
    & Sorcery\u201D implies a sort of wild, low fantasy setting, though. I am thinking
    Fritz Leiber and the like. This stuff was especially popular back in the 1970s
    and became associated with the art nouveau revival that was popular at the time.
    In that vein, the earlier suggestion of my revival, Cristoforo, is reasonable.
    I'd avoid Arnold Boecklin as being a bit of a cliche, but there's plenty of other
    stuff in that vein.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/art+nouveau/fonts/\r\n"

  body: "I spontaneously thought of Mason. Too clich\xE9?\r\n\r\nI agree the briefing
    is very open, and if you\u2019re looking for a heading face then it would be necessary
    to know what you\u2019re using for text.\r\nRe. Satyr: I\u2019ve seen it in <a
    href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Monokromfonts/posts/694431160616411\">one book</a>
    on themes of witchcraft and the like where it worked really great. But that was
    for text too."

  body: "I have seen typefaces like Mason in places like Dafont; as a serious typeface
    it has a place in display use (I <em>could</em> see it (or perhaps remember having
    seen it used) used for chapter headings in a novel, if it was a murder mystery
    following in the Da Vinci Code trend; that's <em>its</em> clich\xE9 niche) - I
    find it too outr\xE9 rather than too clich\xE9 for sword and sorcery use, though
    (that was the fault of <em>my</em> suggestions).\r\n\r\nAnother clich\xE9 suggestion
    would be Freehand or a similar face, like Kingthings Calligraphica."
