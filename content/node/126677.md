  of the onboarding process?\r\nIt seems someone wrote a nice script for our forum
  and bots are having no trouble adding two numbers together to get in.\r\n\r\nWho's
  the Admin? Can we put a better captcha in there?\r\nBeen a part of a lot of forums
  and botrot is real and will fuck up a community slowly over time.\r\n\r\nI'd hate
  to see this forum go down again after missing it for so long."

    out, but I'd love some deputies to help keep eyes on the boards and shut down
    spam if it happens. Send me a DM if interested?
