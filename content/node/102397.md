  in the pre-alpha status now. Our intent is to have FontLab Studio 6 for Windows
  available by the end of this calendar year, and the Mac version 3-4 months later.\r\n\r\nThese
  are early projections but we're on a steady development track right now.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nUs
  FontLab users need support for AFDKO2.0 (from 2007) . AFDKO 2.5 would be nice, but
  give us something that supports {mark}, {mkmk}, and the \"new\" Adobe kerning, as
  found in Arno. \r\n\r\nYou're apparently trying to hit a home run. How about just
  getting to first base? \r\n\r\nOr should we just give up?"

  body: "Went and look at the cited thread. It was from 2012, and included the statement:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>So,
    as for FontLab Studio: there will be one more version of FontLab Studio 5.x for
    both Mac and Windows <strong>available this year</strong>. It will be maintenance
    release with a few potentially useful features.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nEmphasis added.\r\n\r\nAs
    a Windows user, either that \"maintenance\" version was never done, or they forgot
    to notify us. Think we started with FontLab 3.something -- long before \"Studio\"
    was a gleam in anyone's eye. I'd have expected notification if there was an improvement
    to 5.0.4.0.  (5.0.4 is the latest version listed on the web site...)"

    \r\nDepends on which part of the website you look! :-) \r\nThere are more recent
    updates available at \r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/contact-and-support/product-support/updates-and-upgrades/\r\n(a
    link to which I recently received in an email from FontLab 4 days ago. If you
    didn't receive it too, you may want to verify they have your correct address.)\r\nMac
    version is at 5.1.4, Windows at 5.2.1."

    too* and upgraded. And to their credit it actually sounds like much more than
    what I'd call a \"maintenance release\" since according to the email they \"merged
    AsiaFont Studio features\".\r\n\r\n* Maybe make sure they have your correct email.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      been crashing a lot just when I need it most to finish a large project.  Any
      advice or hints how to deal with this will be most welcome!

  body: "Regarding the Windows 5.2.1 version, the Python integration is severely broken
    (I'm told you can't import modules from binary dlls.). Which may not matter in
    some scenarios, depending on how you use Python in FontLab.\r\n\r\nWould anybody
    know what the mysterious \xABAsia Font Studio\xBB features that have been merged
    might be? I know that the limit of 6399 glyphs in one VFB was lifted, but IMHO
    the removal of an artificial limitation could hardly be described as a \xABfeature
    merge\xBB."
