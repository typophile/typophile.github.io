body: "Heya,\r\n\r\nThis is a monthly corporate newsletter that i've been asked to
  design for Heinz Australia (manufacturers predominantly of canned foods).\r\n\r\nhttp://users.tpg.com.au/wheaney/templateProof_001.pdf\r\n(3-page
  PDF)\r\n\r\nSo, it is published mostly for screen viewing, with a short run of digital
  print, so must be readable on screen, hence the sans serif choice for normal copy.\r\n\r\nIt's
  meant to be \"a little bit of fun\".\r\n\r\nPDF shows the general typographic treatment
  so far.  I've gone with two page layouts that should be enough variation for different
  types of content:\r\n\r\n1. Full page, double column text\r\n2. Full page, single
  column with sidebar.\r\n\r\nSetting details:\r\nSingle Column - MS Trebuchet 12/17
  x 21\r\nDouble Column (full page) - MS Trebuchet 12/17 x 27\r\nSidebar - Arial 9.5/13
  x 14.6\r\n\r\nI've spent a bit of time copyfitting, and i'm relatively happy that
  the measures are holding copy sufficently although full justification isnt working
  as well as i would like.  Seems to be a lot of hyphenation and the wordspacing looks
  a bit gappy.\r\n\r\nAlso, i'm not entirely pleased with Bookman/Trebuchet mix.  It
  seems a bit wrong, but i don't want to go to serif face, and Trebuchet is the sans
  with the shortest x-height (which i think is helping balance the colour of the page).
  \ Arial, verdana or other readily available faces are too black. \r\n\r\nAnyway,
  i dont have a lot to compare too, so ide love anyone's opinion.  This is my first
  'real' stab at page compostion.\r\n\r\nCheers!  JonnySchneider"
