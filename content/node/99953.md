  body: First time I heard of these Helvetica knock-offs. Thanks Nick! For the rest,
    I really don't think it could be closer to Helvetica or one of its knock-offs.
    /R, /S, /s and /e are definitely "Akzidenz Grotesk-ish" and even if this kind
    of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-haas-grotesk/std-display-75-bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/536566/315|/R
    could be found as alternate in Neue Haas Grotesk]]. May be a different cut from
    Berthold's, a step between (Berthold) Lange's Akzidenz Grotesk and (Haas) Miedinger's
    Neue Haas Grotesk soon-to-be-renamed Helvetica.

  body: "Taking in consideration period of 1965, pre-digital area and printing process,
    the closest approximation you could get to me is definitely Akzidenz Grotesk.
    This /a curve is even actually closer to Helvetica for me.\r\nBTW, Basic Commercial
    is Azidenz Grotesk: http://typophile.com/node/43625\r\n"
