  me of Wim Crouwel's 1957 Hiroshima poster but this was done almost a decade earlier.
  The letterforms seem to be drawn on a grid of a 7:2 ratio, if I am correct. Minimal
  counters and a very graphic, clean appearance.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    how clumsy the ampersand is, compared to the other letters. And, given the date,
    the lettering probably was not based on an actual foundry-released typeface: the
    design is simply way too ahead of the pace of the times to have been commercially
    viable as a release in metal.\r\n\r\nOr so it seems to me\u2026"

  body: "Thanks for the quick response, oldnick. Is there any metal or digital typeface
    that may look the part anyway? I guess the keywords are narrow letterforms with
    chaffed borders?\r\n\r\nThank you anyway for your answer. "

  body: This kind of construction is often paired with  stroke contrast (see, for
    example, http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/taboo/) or even a stencil effect.
