  to get questions about Vista's [lack of] support for Type 1 (commonly and incorrectly

  Fonts.com has posted that they will try to create PFM files (which are required
  for Vista to use a Type 1 font) for users of their fonts who run into problems. "

    of WIndows. (On older versions of Windows you could install ATM, which would create
    PFM files from PFB+AFM+INF. But starting with Windows 2000 ATM was not required
    to use Type 1 fonts on Windows.)\r\n\r\nIf somebody has been shipping Windows
    Type 1 fonts without PFMs, well, that would be a mistake.\r\n\r\nNow, there also
    is the fact that Windows Presentation Foundation doesn't support Type 1 (nor did
    its predecessor, GDI+). But that's not really a Vista-specific issue.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thomas, \r\n\r\nwell, I would call it Vista-specific in so far that Windows
    Vista is the first operating system that bundles WPF. Essentially, WPF is the
    new (alternative) graphic subsystem that is pre-installed on Vista, but can also
    be retroactively installed on Windows XP and probably Windows 2000. \r\n\r\nIt
    is, surely enough, a good reason why font developers should be phasing out Type
    1 fonts and offer modern font formats (OpenType PS, OpenType TT) at least as an
    alternative. \r\n\r\nA."

    body: "Hi,\r\nI'd like to clarify this a little bit. As of Windows Vista, Windows
      includes three different components with their own text rendering engines:\r\n\r\n1.
      GDI (used in most Win32 applications). GDI supports TrueType (.TTF/.TTC/.OTF),
      Type 1 (*.PFM/*.PFB, plus some multiple master font support if one types the
      complete face name correctly), OpenType CFF (OpenType fonts with CFF outlines,
      .OTF), bitmap fonts (.FON) and very old vector font format fonts (also typically
      .FON).\r\n\r\n2. GDI+ (used either directly through public GDI+ API or through
      .Net Windows Forms component.) GDI+ supports TrueType fonts (.TTF/.TTC/.OTF).\r\n\r\n3.
      WPF (used through the new WPF APIs shipping with .Net 3.0.) WPF supports TrueType
      (.TTF/.TTC/.OTF), OpenType CFF (OpenType fonts with CFF outlines, .OTF), and
      the new composite font file format that is used to describe international font
      linking and fallback logic (.CompositeFont).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you
      have specific customer feedback (assuming it's OK to share, of course) on the
      lack of Type 1 support in WPF.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, and best regards,\r\nMikhail
      Leonov\r\nWPF Text Team, Microsoft Corporation"

      one can uninstall it manually from the \"Turn Windows features on or off\" Control
      Panel applet, it is there, on by default. The assemblies are in %windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v3.0\\WPF\\
      directory. From my personal experience, OEMs like Dell also leave it on. I got
      a new home laptop recently from Dell, and I was able to install the gorgeous
      Seattle PI Newsreader app (http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/newsreader/) on it
      very quickly thanks to that. It's so much easier on eyes than the web version.\r\n\r\nI
      agree with your opinion regarding Type 1 fonts, however I'm still interested
      in learning how much existing customer scenarios and workflows rely on those
      fonts today. [We've had some customer concerns in the past regarding lack of
      Type 1 support in WPF.]\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMikhail"

    their font libraries in the OT formats.\r\n\r\nThis is a small market, I know.

  body: "> <em>just yesterday someone posted on the AAUP designers list lamenting
    the lack of italic small capitals in Garamond Premier Pro, & why weren\u2019t
    they there</em>\r\n\r\nWhat?! Garamond Premier Pro (roman & italic) not only has
    small caps for Latin, it has them for extended Latin, Greek and Cyrillic. <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/GRPP/GaramondPremrPro-It.pdf\">Here's
    the complete glyphset.</a> (PDF file)\r\n\r\nThat person must be confusing Garamond
    Premier Pro with Adobe Garamond Pro, two different type families. Yes, the italic
    fonts of the latter do not have small capitals. This must be due to historical
    reasons; I believe slopped small caps don't exist in the source material. Also,
    some purists think that slopped (bold or regular) small capitals and capitals,
    and the bold italic style overall are mere aberrations, because they are later
    developments and kind of \"overkill\" (like underlining something that is already
    set in bold). Bringhurst has a short section somehow related with this, <em>3.4
    Tribal Alliances & Families</em>.\r\n\r\n> <em>don\u2019t all OpenType fonts have
    Italic small caps</em>\r\n\r\nThat's one of the misconceptions about OpenType.
    Some users think that just because a font is in OpenType format, it contains small
    caps, old style figures, alternate glyphs, broad language support and all the
    other niceties, when in fact it might not be the case. Differentiating between
    'Std' and 'Pro' helps a bit, but even the designation 'Pro' doesn't guarantee
    that two font families have the same feature richness."

    -- Remember the poster on this board who was grousing that there were a bunch
    of Adobe fonts in OpenType that didn't have any more characters than the old Type
    1 fonts? \r\n\r\nAnd no, she wasn't confusing Premier Pro with AG, just \"Couldn't
    find them on the Glyph Pallet.\" Well, it <cite>is</cite> a \"full pallet.\" There
    are better ways to \"find\" them, once you know they really are there.\r\n\r\nAs
    to using \"slopped\" roman or bold small caps for the italic, no, it isn't usually
    done. This isn't out of ignorance. There are a fair number of typographers in
    the AAUP, who know type quite well. The usual attitude is if you don't have a
    small cap, use the full cap. Life will go on. I'd bet what happened is that she'd
    decided on small caps for some level of subheads, & ran into a subhead with italic
    in it, & didn't want to change the subhead style if it could be avoided.\r\n\r\nA
    problem with faking any kind of small caps is you have to do a pretty good job
    of it, or someone in the \"book\" audience (readers, as well as editors) will
    notice, grimace, & write a letter to the publisher. It isn't so much a problem
    of overkill; more like deciding to put on a Shakespeare play using an open set
    but period costumes."

    I had purchased the full Adobe Font Folio  some years ago. A 9k cost btw, and
    have always used Type 1 fonts for highend graphic work. I was always told to only
    use Type 1 for any print related work b/c other formats don''t output at the high
    DPI that printers use. That info came from various print companies btw. So what''s
    the story here? I don''t see the need for Type 1 font support going away anytime
    soon for the graphic industry, and I normally do that kind of work on my mac,
    but I often use fonts from my Adobe Font Folio on a PC - mostly for Flash work. '

    years old. Only 256 glyphs can be encoded in each font. There is no support for
    Unicode or layout features (stylistic or linguistic). Are these enough reasons
    for you?\r\n\r\nAnyway, if support for the Type 1 format goes away in the near
    future, that might only happen at the operating system level. It's likely that
    Adobe apps will continue to support Type 1 after that. For example, the new InDesign
    CS3 still supports Multiple Master fonts despite the fact that Adobe stopped making
    new MM (and Type 1) fonts back in 1999."
