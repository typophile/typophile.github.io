Although I am Brazilian - what, somehow, might as well be a synonym for &#34;broken underpaid poor mofo&#34; to some people- and, yes! I=B4m walking on = dire straits - I must say GET OVER IT, PEOPLE! If you can&#39;t reach AtypI, = build an association yourselves and work hard and try as much as you can to show = some good things and maybe, if you want that so &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; much, you might be invited to some conferece of theirs. &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;! This is typical. It&#39;s this hurt ego thing. &#34;I was born in a &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; poor country, so, boo-hoo me, I have to make everybody feel sorry for me&#34;. = Well, I don&#39;t trade my Minas Gerais for anything in this world. <BR> <BR>It seems to me you point fingers at the people who took initiative and = blame them for being succesful, because you won&#39;t do it yourselves. Not = willing enough. Not quite ready for the real deal of sweat. &#34;The ATypI is ready = so give me access. I don&#39;t want to do a thing.&#34; I&#39;m damn sure that all it = takes to make difference is hard work. We don&#39;t go out and reach the world by weeping. <BR> <BR>Ramiro&#39;s letter is sure a valid thing but if it can&#39;t change a thing, = move on.

		<div class="commentbody">Matha, that would never work, at least not enough. <BR>It would be nice to have such a mechanism in place, but we couldn&#39;t <i>rely</i> on it. <BR> <BR>Keith, the benefits of ATypI are in large part &#34;intangible&#34;. For some people it&#39;s an obligation of sorts, and for a lot of people it&#39;s not a &#34;sound investment&#34;: you become a member if you love type. And John is right, you should be thinking how <i>you</i> could help. <BR> <BR>One very tangible benefit of ATypI membership is being able to ask question on the discussion list: you&#39;ll possibly get an expert reply, and usually get some usable insight. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">John said: <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;d be game. <BR> <BR>I thought you might be <BR> <BR>&#62; but I don&#39;t think this kind of individual sponsorship can achieve the same goal as an  <BR>&#62; adjustment of membership fees relative to something like GDP, which opens the door <BR>&#62; much wider. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m all for adjusting the fees. Some people would complain but I think it&#39;s basically fair. In the meantime, sponsorship would be a significant step in the right direction.  <BR> <BR>Matha</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Hrant and John, I agree... I joined ATypI because I love type, and no one would choose to study type design because he/she wants to make tons of money. So, yes, I think the most important thing is the community that you get when you join an association like ATypI... <BR> <BR>BUT, with the internet, it might be just as easy to get support from other typographer/type designers... A good example is this board. I would still like to see tangible support and benefits, beause it is not cheap to join. I&#39;m really not the kind who thinks about economic returns... it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t have a ton of money to spend. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m more than happy to help... I would in fact like to get some local involvement for the next ATypI, and to involve myself. <BR> <BR>K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant said <BR> <BR>&#62; It would be nice to have such a mechanism in place, but we couldn&#39;t rely on it.  <BR> <BR>No, we certainly coudn&#39;t rely on it. But there is a new trend in collecting money for charitable purposes : the direct debit. You contribute a smallish sum of money every month without even noticing. It helps the organisation in question to plan ahead because they know in advance what&#39;s coming in. <BR> <BR>&#62; the benefits of ATypI are in large part &#34;intangible&#34;.  <BR> <BR>I agree with this, but I think part of the problem is that new members come to ATypI with preconceived ideas of what these benefits are and can be very easily disappointed. I know that the fiasco with the book in Rome disappointed me but I&#39;ve gotten over it and I&#39;ll live to fight another day. <BR> <BR>Matha <BR> <BR></div>
