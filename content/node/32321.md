    Mike Yanega's <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide01.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Multiline Font Guide</a>, which includes several undigitized
    Letraset typefaces, shows nothing closer than Prisma."

  body: "I didn't realize that I was missing Prisma from that Guide. I have it in
    one of the Dover books by Dan Solo, and so I will add a scan of that one too.
    The posted sample is like Prisma, as Mike said, except that the Prisma in this
    book shows five lines, rather than three, in each stroke.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It turned out there were four other typefaces, in addition to Prisma, in
    that book that I wanted to show. I have just completed updating the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide05.html\">Multiline
    page</a> of the Lined Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    added a lowercase.

  body: "Yeah, I realized that, but the 'real' Prisma had no lower case, and besides
    that other sample was too hard to see.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
