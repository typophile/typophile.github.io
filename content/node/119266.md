    by Speedball, Wello, Atkinson or one of the others but I can't find a specimen.
    Anyone?\r\nBTW these letters are very easy to make. Feel free to use the raster
    version of some draft letters made from scratch as a test exercise for making
    a possible font[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FireworksSans3DSM_4337.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: Thank you to both of you for your replies. Don, that lettering in your last
    post, immediately above, looks like exactly the same font as my sample. Note the
    R and W in particular. What font did you use to create that?

  body: "As I said \"made from scratch\" which means that no existing font was used.
    It's not rocket science to make this sort of letter, including the stub leg _R_
    and the peaked apex _W_.\r\nThe _O_ in the lettering is thicker than the other
    letters and perhaps smaller in scale. I compromised by keeping the scale and thickening
    the top and bottom strokes.\r\nBTW, the _S_  has to extend considerably lower
    than _O_ to have a similar thickness and  allow the 3D effect to work\r\nOnce
    the basic outlines are about right, it's relatively straight forward to use a
    3D extrusion font making tool and to adjust the results to approximate the original
    hand lettered 3D effect.  Some letters, such as _S_ take some tinkering.\r\nDon"
