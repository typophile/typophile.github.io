body: I'm working on a site for a law firm. This is not something that's my usual
  forte -- both web design and conservative, traditional design, that is. This site
  is being built in Flash, so I can use whatever font(s) work, but a lot of the obvious
  traditional serifed faces seem really hard on the eyes when displayed on screen,
  and a lot of the sans faces that look crisp on screen feel too modern, tech, or
  casual. Any suggestions?

    like a law firm. That is not were Flash exceeds, and neither is deep linking.

    for you to look at. \r\n\r\nIf the only reason you decided to use Flash was font
    supporty you should also consider @font-face or a sIFR-like technology. More info
    in: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/57934\">this</a> thread. Most foundries
    allow \u201Csecure\u201D web embedding technologies like sIFR."

  body: '@frode frank: The use of Flash was just something I was given in the brief,
    not a decision on my end. I''m just handing my .psds off to a developer. I''ve
    seen many workarounds for SEO in Flash, like if you keep all your txt and html
    files that get fed into your .swf file(s) in one clear folder, when the google
    crawlers come knocking, they don''t have too much trouble going through these
    files. Of course, you are right that Flash is not the best when it comes to SEO,
    but since this firm is more the kind people specifically seek out, and less the
    kind on billboards and bus stop benches that will get you a cash settlement today,
    I don''t know that they need to come up on google''s first page when you search
    for legal advice.'

  body: "\"Rembember that you need good interaction with search engines\"\r\n\r\nMore
    important, you need good interaction with end-users/potential customers. Flash
    isn't always (often USUALLY) the best option for that. \r\n\r\nWhatever you do,
    though, err on the side of the type being large as it's not necessarily easy for
    end-users to resize flash rendered type. Given that, if you're perhaps going 14px
    or so, you might find that a lot of the faces will meet your needs. "
