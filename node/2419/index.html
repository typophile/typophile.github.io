		<div class="commentbody">My two lincoln cents: the U mark looks like something created for a paper company. I don't feel its Academic, maybe its the colors. The typeface is forgettable. I like the Caps and small caps version of the old logo better. I think you have a ways to go. Maybe its time to go away from the computer (paper and a pencil, come up with a look you like then find a way to make it on the computer)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it works. The Colors and the &quot;U&quot; mark all seem quite resolved. T'd stick with the U/lc type treatment - all lowercase id very fashionable now, but more appropriately reserved for projecting the kind of self-conscious humility yhat multi national corporations crave these days. Initial caps and lowercase seems more formally suited for an educationally-oriented venture. <BR> <BR>The selection of typeface should, of course, be more considered. <BR> <BR>Anyway, it's tons better than this:  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23012.gif" alt="united rentals"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here's an update.  Thanks for the feedback.  It's helped a lot. <BR> <BR>As far as lowercase/uppercase.. I decided to stick with the uc U because of the emphasis on the letter U in the mark as well as other campaign related issues that tie into their market. <BR> <BR>For example, they deal with Universities so the promenent U makes sense for them. <BR> <BR>Myriad was the favored typeface because of its close resemblence to Frutiger, which was initially appealing due to its clean / symmetrical strokes and its classic nature.  But since Myriad is a bit more friendly, it worked better for their messaging. <BR> <BR>I wasn't comfortable really changing it because sometimes you can't improve on perfection.  Also, I think uniqueness and memorability can be achieved through orientation, in this case the mark, colors, and layout of the logo. <BR> <BR>I would still like to hear other views, so please share your thoughts to help me make whatever improvements I can before this goes live. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24267.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Cristian, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the comments.  I'll make a few changes today and post later. <BR> <BR>As far as the weight of the stroke, I actually changed it manually to be a bit heavier then the original.  I was going for more of an optical balance between the white stroke that seperates the U in the mark and the overall weight of the mark.  Besides, having it any lighter looks odd in print &ndash; just too thin.  You disagree?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Chritian might be right. It would seem that either the logo mark and logo type need to be connected somehow (maybe some alternative positioning) or their needs to be some unifying element (maybe the suggested weight association, I don't think the color is enough to do the trick here). If you do try to optically match the weight of the white stroke and the type, then it could probably most successfully be accomplished by a combination of lightening the type weight and decreasing the overall typesize. As it appears right now, the mark and type are competing a little for attention, rather than combining to make a strong logo. You are fortunate to have a typophile like Christian to catch this, because I was too blind to see it at first. <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR>Scott</div>

I'm guessing that it is mathmatically equal to the angle at the top of the mark, but optically it doesn't match up. I'd be interested in seeing angles on all of the verticals (U, n, i, n)</div>

I'll need to communicate this to the client.  One thing they wanted, as a departure from their current logo, is something with more strength and dominance.

Depending on the industry, &quot;strength and dominence&quot; may be achieved through various elements. In this case, developers of &quot;enterprise software for the academic/education industry&quot; would be served well if their logo was a beacon of refinement. I don't think this option is &quot;elegant&quot;, but rather a little more sophisticated relative to the other options. I believe if you pitched this design as refined and sophisticated, it would demand attention</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all the feedback guys!  It's really helped drive the refinement of this thing. <BR> <BR>So much in fact, the when I began to take a close look, I realized that there were some inherent balance issues with the symbol and the type.  The symbol also wasn't very flexible when arranged in a different position other than presented. <BR> <BR>So what I went back the drawing-board.  I have a couple of variations here which I think make a cleaner evolution of the existing logo (<a href="http://www.unicon.net" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.unicon.net">www.unicon.net</a></a>). <BR> <BR>Please let share your thoughts. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25349.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">i def. like you first concepts better, i am not a fan of the later ones with the circle and italicized type. I think also that it might be very valid to see if you cannot incoporate all the letters so that they combine somehow, like using modified serifs to attach all the letter to each other. This might give a little bit of play on the company name, being as all the letters would be acting as a sinlge word, unified, rather than individual letters, not unified. It might now work, you might have already tried, but I think its an idea. I like your concept, and execution, and I think this logo has great potential.</div>

However, if I saw option 3 - I'd look and wonder&hellip;who are they, how come I havn't seen them before, how come they're so well put together - it has quiet confidence while the others look like they are striving to be something, or need investors.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you should back up and forget about the typeface until you get a logo that they can live with for years to come. To me the image says fabricated metal or formed plastic. I would work on that, throwing away a lot of sketches, and challenging them all by the dawn's ugly light next day. You'll get it. The simpler it is, the longer and harder you have to work. Remember, they want strong, approachable, and classic. That's a tall order. Good luck.</div>
