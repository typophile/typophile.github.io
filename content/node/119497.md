    the designer mixed and matched with the two typefaces?\r\n\r\n"

    on the cover, though, is kind of different, especially the O; it\u2019s more geometric
    and monolinear.\r\n"

  body: "I was only focused on the title at the top of the cover, but I think Ralphsmouse
    is right, it may be hand-drawn or, at the very least, a mash-up of several typefaces.\r\n\r\nEven
    my suggestion of Alternate Gothic has a too narrow center vertex on the M, a problem
    it shares with Dick's suggestion of Ludlow 6-EC Gothic Extra Condensed (the basis
    for Silvertone Woodtype). The Ludlow typeface at least has an R that works.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, an artist's hand appears to have been at work on the cover...."
