  body: That's what I thought. But when I do an overlay the weight and the "tilt"
    are not the same. Its not standard Arial Bold Italic. At least not my system version.

  body: Ok. I feel stupid now. Thanks. So, Arial Black, sheared 10 degrees. I just
    knew I was a different font. I did not think someone would shear Arial.
