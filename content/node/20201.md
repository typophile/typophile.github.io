    coming up before are now, so that's encouraging,\r\nbut some other stuff (like
    \"Helvomita\" :-) that I <cite>know</cite> is\r\nthere isn't...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: The 5 was for Typophile's <a href="http://www.typophile.com/beta">fifth anniversary</a>
    and the release date of 5/5/05. The removal of the beta tag is discussed elsewhere
    (can't locate at the mo').

  body: The 5 was useless since no one knew what it meant. You haven't fixed everything
    yet but its better. Plus don't be so defensive Stephen

    haven\u2019t fixed everything yet</em>\r\n\r\nI don't fix code 'round here. That's
    all managed by the fellas at Punchcut, with Christian Robertson doing most of
    the nitty gritty."

  body: "For me, at least, the search function does not work. A search results in
    a list, but once an item on the list is selected, it is not possible to go back
    to the list. It is necessary to do the search all over again. \r\n\r\nif it works
    for others, what is the secret handshake?"

  body: Any chance the subscription-slash-donation stuff will be implemented soon?  It
    seems bizzare to say, but i'm excited for the opportunity to give something back.
