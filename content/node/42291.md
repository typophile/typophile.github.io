  but heavier, and the K and S are so specifics...\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    couple of free ones from <a href=\"http://www.blambot.com/fonts.shtml\">Blambot</a>
    are kinda close.\r\n\r\nanyone else find that low-waisted K familiar?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/176248301_547f1dc033_6416.jpg]"

    of general curiosity. ;)\r\n\r\n> I\u2019m with Stephen on this one. Look at the
    bottom of the \u2019T\u2019 and \u2019H\u2019 - you can see where they overshot
    the letters with the X-Acto\r\n\r\nhmm, these look like they might be jpg. artifacts
    or other boogers from repeated digital/mechanical reproduction.\r\n\r\nif they
    actually cut those letters, and scanned them in such a way to show little cardboard
    shards, wouldn't there be some sense of depth or texture to the letters?\r\n\r\nand
    if someone did cut them with an x-acto, why get the lines so straight, and arrange
    them so perfectly as to look 'computer'.\r\n\r\nthe various iterations of the
    same logo  don't feel hand-cut ... or hand-drawn ... and their current logo appears
    to be a font.\r\n\r\nI looked for a higher-res version, but was not successful
    finding anything bigger than these.\r\n\r\ni also emailed the band ... \r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't be surprised if indeed, they are custom letters. But again, that K made
    me think freefont.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kills1_6058.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/269786_4543.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/397150_4575.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/520493_4837.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KillsEP_(2)_4013.jpg]\r\n\r\ncurrent\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ad_4065.jpg]"

    there were computers there were these wonderful things called straight-edges,
    rulers, triangles - they enabled you to cut straight lines using x-acto knives.
    See here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/41942\r\n\r\nIt is also possible someone
    created these letters in a hurry in Illustrator without bothering to clean them
    up.\r\n\r\nSo is this band any good?"

    those wondering, the band's new album (Midnight Boom) is great, but their previous
    efforts are a bit less appealing. "
