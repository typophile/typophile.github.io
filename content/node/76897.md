body: Hi, I was wondering if anyone knows why on many 19th century type specimen prints
  they are often produced in black and red ink. Often they are black typefaces with
  a red border or decorative elements and sometimes both black and red typefaces.
  Just wondering if there is a reason for this use of colors. Thanks in advance.

    and it looks attractive and powerful. Black-White-Red is the color triumvirate.
    Black is the queen.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: There is a tradition of red being the second colour added to a print job going
    all the way back to Egyptian scribes. The choice is a sign of classical taste.
