  with the pointed bottom vertex. It also looks slightly condensed, which appears
  to have been done manually.\r\n\r\nYour help is appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pet-supply-font_4165.png]"

  body: "The taller, pointy /V/A/ may not belong to the original font, \r\nthey could
    be the side effect of a badly performed manual bold operation,\r\nespecially if
    your original sample is a sign (e.g. is cut on vinyl, etc)."
