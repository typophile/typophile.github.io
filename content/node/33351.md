body: "Hello everybody,\r\nI just discovered this lovely forum and I'm hoping you
  can help me with an issue.\r\n\r\nWe do packaging here using Adobe Illustrator v10
  through to CS2 (more often than not CS2) on the Mac. A lot of our work is multilingual
  and often involves non-roman typefaces.\r\n\r\nI am looking to buy a really good
  set of Helvetica Cyrillic to help overcome some of our Cyrillic issues. I had this
  in mind:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=438768&grab_id=0&page_id=4731&query=helvetica%20cyrillic&SCOPE=Fonts\r\n\r\nI'd
  love to know if anybody has purchased this, what they think of it etc, whether there
  are any other comprehensive sets that people can recommend.\r\n\r\nMy other issue
  is that we have some files that have text that has been set in RusHelvetica-Bold.
  This font was lent to us by the originator but it seems to be corrupt. We were going
  to buy the Helvetica Russian family but it seems to be an ancient font and impossible
  to buy now. So this is another reason why I find myself looking for a good Cyrillic
  Helvetica. What I am concerned about is whether I will be able to select my text
  and switch from RusHelvetica-Bold to the new font without any issues. Can anybody
  advise me on this?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    Adobe has a few, some of which are bundled with the CS suites.\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/C/C_cyrillic.html\r\n\r\n>

    not. From what you say, I suspect that the font you have is _not_ Unicode-compliant.
    If that's so, then you will have problems when using an Unicode-compliant font,
    like OpenType fonts tend to be. You can, however, make your text Unicode-savvy,
