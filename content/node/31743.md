  body: "The other lettering seems to have been hand placed, because the angles are
    not consistent for identical letters, but the font could have been a heavy weight
    of Bernhard Gothic, Kabel or Grizzly, I think. The W and K would be the letters
    to match.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "After checking all three of those, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-kabel/bold/\">Kabel
    Bold</a> seems the closest. Some editing would be needed to square off some of
    the terminals, but that's what I'd start with, unless someone find the actual
    font that was used. However, from your question, I think maybe you were more interested
    in the other lettering?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
