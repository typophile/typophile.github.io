    collection of script fonts that wouldn't have been at those two sites. \r\n\r\nAnyone
    else? Is it custom? At this point that would be my guess.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike: Thank you for the effort, you really went through a lot of fonts there!
    Asturias might not be a perfect match, but I definately like it -- so thanks for
    pointing me in its direction :)\r\n\r\nAndreas: I noticed that too! The way the
    letters connect seems unique; I don't think I've ever seen anything like it in
    cursive writing/typography.\r\n\r\n...Anyway, in case you're curious to see more
    of it, I scanned the other two instances of it being used in the magazine. It's
    a shame if it indeed is a custom job; it seems to be a complete enough font, and
    it really is quite lovely.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/airfont2_4915.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/airfont3_5798.jpg]\r\n\r\n/Annette"

  body: "Andreas, I am not sure about what you say. Take a look at how characters
    connect in Metroscript from Alphabet Soup for instance, very similar. It rather
    seems to be a design decision than not knowing Western handwriting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---

  body: Mmh... Metroscript is a rather tight script font where that makes at least
    some sense. I would compare this one rather to a font like Bickley Script. But
    let's call it a design decision anyway, on the basis that there are good decisions
    as well as bad ones ;-)
