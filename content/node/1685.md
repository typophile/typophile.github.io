  body: I have concluded that it is pointless to talk politics here, and will do my
    best to resist it. However two parting shots.  <BR> <BR>First, John H., an Israeli
    liberal who is an old friend, and was there in 48, said that what Israel did then
    was not terrorism, as it was only directed against the military. However, he does
    view the attacks  now against Arabs in the occupied territories as terrorist.  <BR>
    <BR>Second, Hrant, all of your analysis seems to support the 9/11 attacks on the
    US. Do you in fact approve of them?

  body: <i>...what Israel did then was not terrorism, as it was only directed against
    the military</i> <BR> <BR>An assertion I agree with. Even the bombing of the King
    David Hotel was clearly a strike against the British military command centre there,
    and the Irgun actively sought to avoid civilian casualties by alerting the hotel,
    the neutral French consolate, and the Palestine Post newspaper ahead of the bombing.
    None of the warnings were taken seriously. <BR> <BR>Charges are made that Palestinian
    civilians were targeted during the &#39;48 war, in order to encourage them to
    abandon their villages. Frankly, I don&#39;t know enough about the evidence to
    comment. <BR> <BR>In my previous message, I was talking about the perception of
    the Haganah and Irgun campaigns by others, who see only the apparent success of
    a struggle of illegal, geurilla organisations to win a country for themselves
    by killing people and blowing things up. Who they were killing and what they were
    blowing up are details that don&#39;t necessarily register in such a perception.

  body: 'Hrant, from the other thread: <BR> <BR><i>People are responsible for their
    actions, whether they&#39;re holding a gun or not. You think Blair is not a legitimate
    military target?! And when somebody in the US for example votes for a president
    based on the hope that that president will &#34;kill the bastards&#34;, he becomes
    an active part of the problem.</i> <BR> <BR>So do you think, after WWII the Nurenberg
    courts should have hung every German who joined or even voiced any support for
    the Nazi party? Or do you accept that people can be wrong, and can be brought
    to understand that they were wrong, and can change their ideas. <BR> <BR>Actually,
    no, I don&#39;t think leaders and members of <i>civilian</i> governments are legitimate
    targets in war &#40;this is not true of military states; and I&#39;m not sure
    where Bush&#39;s status as Commander in Chief leaves him&#41;. I don&#39;t like
    Tony Blair, and I don&#39;t think the invasion of Iraq was justified even on the
    grounds that he attempted to justify it, but I don&#39;t think that makes him
    a legitimate target for military action. He is a legitimate target for international
    legal action, along with any other civilian leader. <BR> <BR><i>Why do you think
    terrorists focus on killing &#34;non-combatants&#34; in Democracies?</i> <BR>
    <BR>For the same reason that terrorists target civilians in non-democratic countries:
    because they&#39;re soft targets. <BR> <BR>According to your previous messages,
    the USA practices terrorism on a vast scale, but if they&#39;re attacking non-democracies
    such as Iraq, what is the point of terrorism? If you genuinely think that the
    US deliberately targets civilians, why would that be? It&#39;s not like the Iraqi
    people had any influence on Saddam Hussein&#39;s policies.'

  body: 'Gerald, from the other thread: <BR> <BR><i>Are saying that Iraq was a terrorist
    nation?</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, as clear from the targeting of their own civilian population,
    especially ethnic and religious minorities but also political opponents. <BR>
    <BR><i>That Bush and Blaire were morally justified in attacking Iraq because of
    that?</i> <BR> <BR>No, unless they&#39;re willing to attack everyone, everywhere
    who deliberately targets civilians. They&#39;re neither willing nor capable of
    that, so it is unsound as a justification for attacking a particular country.
    <BR> <BR><i>Are you saying that daisy bombs are not terrifying?</i> <BR> <BR>No.
    I&#39;m saying that not everything that is terrifying is terrorism. It depends
    on whom you are dropping the daisycutter. [There is a completely different discussion
    to be had about appropriate force during war, but that is not a discussion about
    terrorism.] <BR> <BR><i>Are you suggesting that it would not be terrifying to
    be a Palestinian? That Palestinians have not lost innocent people. </i> <BR> <BR>Not
    at all, and I maintain that if the Israeli government and military are <i>deliberately</i>
    targeting non-combatants then they are terrorists. <BR> <BR>Perhaps I can make
    it clearer by putting it this way: I am taking a politically neutral view of terrorism
    &#40;but not a morally neutral view&#41;. I&#39;m saying that the definition terrorism
    has nothing to do with the rightness of one&#39;s cause, or the desperateness
    of one&#39;s situation. I&#39;m saying that terrorism is an identifiable <i>act</i>
    that involves the intentional killing or injury of civilians. The fact that life
    for Palestinians in the occupied territories is terrible and terrifying does not
    mean that a Palestinian militant blowing up a bus full of civilians in Jerusalem
    is somehow not terrorism. It is terrorism. <BR> <BR>Of course, a political neutral
    view of terrorism suggests the possibility that terrorism <i>can be justified</i>:
    a possibility that even supporters of the Palestinian cause, and the Northern
    Irish Catholic cause, and a hundred other violently expressed causes around the
    world, are themselves, apparently, uncomfortable with. Hence the unwillingness
    to call spades spades and terrorism terrorism, and the popular artificial distinction
    between terrorists and freedom fighters. <BR> <BR><i>Would that not make Israel
    a terrorist state?</i> <BR> <BR>If they deliberately target non-combatants, yes.
    This was certainly the case when Israeli forces let Phalangist militias into the
    refugee camps at Sabra and Shatila to massacre Palestinian civilians. That was
    an act of terrorism. Sharon, who was Defence Minister at the time, was forced
    to resign as a result, but this would be far from sufficient justice even if he
    hadn&#39;t returned as Prime Minister. <BR> <BR><i>So just what do you expect
    the Palestinian to do? Lie down and die, don&#39;t make a fuss because it might
    upset our dictionary?</i> <BR> <BR>Gerald, did you read what I wrote? I never
    said that the Palestinians should lie down and die, but nor should they pretend
    that acts of terrorism are somehow not terrorism. Maybe they think it is the only
    strategy they have -- terrorism has traditionally been the military strategy of
    the desperate -- but that doesn&#39;t make it something other than terrorism.
    <BR> <BR>One more example: when a group of desperate English Catholics decided
    to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill the king and his ministers, they
    became terrorists, although the term didn&#39;t exist in 1605. It doesn&#39;t
    make it not terrorism that their civilian targets were in positions of authority,
    or that their civilian targets were persecuting them, killing their priests and
    friends, imprisoning them for their beliefs, and stealing their property. It doesn&#39;t
    make it not terrorism that I am sympathetic to their cause, even though they were
    both morally and politically mistaken in their choice of strategy. <BR> <BR>All
    I have said in this discussion is that we should call terrorism by name when we
    see it, and not get confused by our sympathies or by the real and desperate plight
    of many people who resort to terrorism &#40;although this obviously doesn&#39;t
    include Saudi millionaires&#41;.'

    mean that it isn&#39;t terrorism &#40;and it certainly doesn&#39;t make it a duty&#41;.
    This is what I referred to earlier -- what no one seems to want to acknowledge
    -- that terrorism can be politically and even legally justified &#40;I don&#39;t
    believe it can be morally justified&#41;. There was a time when the PLO were proud
    of their status as international terrorists: before Arafat became media friendly.
    Abu Daoud, who masterminded the murder of Israeli atheletes at the 1972 Olympics
    under direct order from Arafat, entitled his autobiography <i>Memoirs of a Palestinian
    Terrorist.</i> That is how he identified himself. Indeed, if you decide to pursue
    terrorism as a strategy, there is a large propaganda impact to be gained from
    declaring the fact: letting people know that you are targeting them increases
    the terror. Of course, calling yourself a terrorist in 2003 is going to put you
    in the gunsights of the world&#39;s only superpower, so terrorists are understandably
    less keen to own the name. That doesn&#39;t change the nature of what they do,
    whether you think it is justified by their circumstances or not.'

  body: 'No, Gerald, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re talking about the same thing. I&#39;ve
    provided a definition of what terrorism is that makes it possible to identify
    terrorists by their actions: deliberately targeting civilians for death or injury.
    Anyone who does that -- regardless of their nationality, political or religious
    allegiance, circumstance, position of power or lack of power -- is practicing
    terrorism and is a terrorist. What does this have to do with Iraelis and Palestinians?
    Only as much as <i>some</i> Israelis are terrorists and <i>some</i> Palestinians
    are terrorists. Calling these people terrorists does not mean that all Israelis
    and all Palestinians are terrorists, nor does it say anything about the rights
    and wrongs of the conflict in the Middle East. <BR> <BR>As regards giving hope
    to the Palestinians in the occupied territories, who are in most need of hope,
    the Arab nations are and always have been in the best position to provide that
    hope. They have chosen to leave the Palestinians as a festering wound in the side
    of Israel rather than offer either homes or material assistance. [With the singular
    exceptance of Jordan, which has always been the home of most Palestinians.] Likewise,
    the Palestinians&#39; own political leadership offers no hope to its people, being
    rife with corruption and interested only in maintaining power. A couple of years
    ago, Canada offered to accept Palestinian refugees as immigrants, so some at least
    could build new lives in a safe country. The response from Hezbollah, a Palestinian
    &#39;political&#39; organisation, was that Canada would be a target of terrorism
    if it dared to accept Palestinian immigrants. <BR> <BR>History is full of refugees
    leaving their homes and settling elsewhere. In 1948, at the same time as Palestinians
    fled or were forced from their homes, hundreds of thousands of Jews fled or were
    forced from their homes in Arab countries -- where their families had lived for
    centuries -- and settled in Israel. These people are not still living in refugee
    camps more than half a century later, so why are the Palestinians? <BR> <BR>Or
    perhaps you prefer this parallel: In 1945-46, hundreds of thousands of Germans
    fled that part of their country that was ceded to Poland in the aftermath of WWII.
    These refugees found new homes in other countries. When was the last time you
    heard it suggested that Poland should give that land back to Germany or allow
    all German refugees to return there?'

    I think all Hector is saying is that what goes around comes around. Having lived
    extensively among Arabs, I can state that the extreme reaction that some of them
    show to ruthless Western Imperalism might not always be fully justifiable, but
    it is very much <i>understandable</i> - it is in fact a result of a desire for
    <i>fairness</i> in the Arab psyche, something in fact shared with Americans&#42;.
    You cannot reduce terrorism by making people angrier. Unless you mean to exterminate
    them. Your leaders are using you as receivers of resistive violence to make themselves
    richer. You are cannon fodder for the grandchildren of the wealthy. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    Both Arabs and Americans are a young people, although the latter of course much
    younger, and perhaps the reason the latter are so easily brainwashed. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I think any definition of terrorism has to also include the threat of violence.
    <BR> <BR>As far as I can see &#40;but for the moment, I&#39;ve only glanced at
    the rest of the thread&#41; noone has mentioned this aspect. Terrorists aren&#39;t
    obliged to actually kill people to spread terror. There are, for example, plenty
    of terrorists in Northern Ireland who rely on fear alone to achieve their objectives.  <BR>
    <BR>Deliberately targeting civilians for death or injury is murder. Killing them
    to make someone afraid enough to do what you want, makes it terrorism. I think
    it is safe to say that you can generate the terror without the killing. Most terrorists
    generally do both, but it&#39;s not always the case. <BR> <BR>M.

    United States after knives were discovered hidden on two planes.</b> <BR>BBC18/10/03
    <BR> <BR>This, for example is terrorism. Hiding knives in 2 planes causes national
    panic. Granted, we have the precedent of 9/11 looming in the background but whoever
    planted the knives didn&#39;t kill anyone and probably wasn&#39;t even intending
    to. The result is the same though. The IRA telephoning the BBC and pretending
    that they&#39;ve planted a  bomb in Paddington station is the same sort of terrorism.
    Because it&#39;s the IRA and the threat is credible, the station will be evacuated.  <BR>

    because they or others like them have killed in the past, or have provided other
    evidence that when they point a gun at your kneecap they wouldn&#39;t think twice
    about pulling the trigger. An IRA bomb threat is credible because they&#39;ve
    bombed things.

  body: Gerald, I think we&#39;re talking past each other. You seem to be talking
    about how the word terrorist is spun in the media and by politicians; I&#39;m
    talking about avoiding spin by establishing a definition that is linked to an
    act rather than to the motives or circumstance of an act. I think this is important
    because I believe that both those who excuse Israeli terrorism against Palestinians
    and those who excuse Palestinian terrorism against Israelis <i>are spinning the
    meaning of the term.</i> The only way to avoid such spin is to refuse to accept
    motives and circumstances into the definition of an act. <BR> <BR> <BR>[Hrant,

    <BR>Actually, Hamaas does not claim to be a political organization: it&#39;s the

    Yes, it&#39;s confusing &#40;perhaps intentionally so&#41;, but it&#39;s really
    no different than pretending for example that the two US political parties have

    some years now, with the result large numbers of people simply assume that it
