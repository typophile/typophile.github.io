body: "Hi everyone...\r\n\r\nIm looking for typefaces used in the logo of LEGO and
  MATCHBOX.\r\n\r\nBoth might possible be handdrawn, but because a lot of digitalisation\r\nhas
  been going on the last years (like Tintin comic-balloons typeface...)\r\nmaybe something
  similar has been done for these two brands.\r\n\r\nBut maybe both are based on exixsting
  typefaces...\r\n\r\nanyone a idea?\r\n\r\nmany thanks,\r\n\r\nmatthijs\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/legofont.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/matchboxfont.jpg]"
