body: "Having coughed up a large sum for the Creative Suite Master Collection, on
  the principle that although I would never use a lot of the apps, it\u2019s always
  good to be prepared, I was rather disappointed that when such a situation recently
  arose, it didn\u2019t have what I needed.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I was expecting
  some designer-friendly alternative to PowerPoint. Up to now, I\u2019ve always used
  PDFs, made in InDesign, to create a \u201Cslide show\u201D, but now I want to include
  sound, movies, and dissolves. \r\n\r\nAnyway, $20 for Keynote is OK. The canned
  transitions are a bit cheesy but should be \uFB01ne used with discretion, and simpler
  than Flash, Fireworks or After Effects.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is one HUGE problem
  (for a typophile): unless I\u2019m mistaken it doesn\u2019t support font kerning
  metrics! \r\n\r\nI have several options:\r\n\r\n<ol> <li>Use Keynote, but import
  bitmapped kerned text blocks made in InDesign or Photoshop.</li> <li>Use Keynote,
  manually kerning the most obvious letter combinations.</li> <li>Do the whole thing
  in InDesign.</li> <li>Use a monospaced font.</li> <li>Some other application.</li></ol>\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you recommend?\r\n"

    or InDesign. Granted it takes a bit of looking to find the right menus etc.

  body: "PPT does have some basic kerning / tracking controls, on the PC side at least.
    Be aware that the PC and Mac versions of PPT will vary quite a bit in features,
    but more-so in interface and controls. In PPT 2010 you can find some basic options
    by selecting your text or text frame and clicking the tiny little box / arrow
    underneath the character color icon (in the Font section of the ribbon). This
    will open up the \"Font\" window, which has some more \"advanced\" type features,
    the second tab of which is kerning / tracking. Also bear in mind that in general,
    PPT does not play well with OTF fonts. \r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact MS just released
    a service pack a few weeks ago that made OTF fonts disappear when you put the
    presentation in \"present\" mode. They have since fixed the issue I believe. Not
    100% sure, as I had to roll back my system."

    body: I haven't used flash in a decade but i recall it was quite complex and has
      no doubt evolved so that i would struggle now. it seems the route to take is
      to make static pages in InDesign, which I am very comfortable in, then import
      pages into Keynote and add sound and transitions.

    called Flash. ;-)\r\n\r\nAnd by the way: more and more of those animation functions
    came to InDesign already. Since CS5 you can do all sorts of animations directly
    from within InDesign. Of course, those features are not part of the PDF standard,
    so they won't export to PDF directly. You can however export an SWF and embed
    that in a PDF again \u2026"

    able to embed fonts into a presentation, so if you present from a different computer,
    you need to install your fonts first (and hopefully find the time to delete them
    again afterwards)."
