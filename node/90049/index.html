2. Non-Standard Links  Following are the five main guidelines for links:

• Make obvious what’s clickable: for text links, use colored, underlined text (and don't underline non-link text).  

• Differentiate visited and unvisited links.

• Explain what users will find at the other end of the link, and include some of the key information-carrying terms in the anchor text itself to enhance scannability and search engine optimization (SEO). <strong>Don’t use “click here” or other non-descriptive link text</strong>.

• Avoid JavaScript or other fancy techniques that break standard interaction techniques for dealing with links.

In particular, don’t open pages in new windows (except for PDF files and such).</p> <p>Links are the Web's number one interaction element. Violating common expectations for how links work is a sure way to confuse and delay users, and might prevent them from being able to use your site.

For example, instead of linking “I just came across an interesting Kickstarter project. For more information, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2094022925/gremolata-and-cancellaresca-milanese">click here</a>” (which provides the user with no information as to where they are going to end up without additionally reading the words around the ambiguous word “here,” try:

I agree with you Christopher, but remember that to a novice it doesn't matter if the rule was made last month or 20 years ago, it's all new to them. 

If I decide to learn carpentry, I may make some of the same mistakes my grandfather did 50 years ago when he was learning it. I'm a beginner making beginner mistakes.

(Of course if the person has previously been taught the rules and then ignores them, that's a different matter.)

I don't think links need to be underlined; a second color is sufficient.

I also almost never see a need to differentiate visited links. I don't do this when I design sites and it annoys me when other designers do. Except in rare situations, like long lists of nondescriptive links, I don't think there's any need for this.

I <em>always</em> want links to open in new windows, at least links to external sites and documents. I am now in the habit of right-clicking on links so I can choose "open in new window." I want to be able to keep reading the page I'm on before taking a look at where I'm going.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Joshua Langman and don't think the web is made for absolute rules of right and wrong. I still use a "click here" from time to time depending on the situation. I have a great client that's a rural telephone company that has customers just now experiencing email and web for the first time. While it may be understood that everyone knows how web links work, and that "click here" isn't necessary, that can be an erroneous assumption. The rules of right and wrong depend on the situation and the audience. That overt call to action is needed for that audience.

I'm reminded of how when CSS came out and it was declared that tables were never to be used any more. I then got several Excel spreadsheets that had to be put on the web. It took me awhile to get the "no tables" thing out of my head and realize in this situation tables ruled. </div>

User tests tend to show otherwise. Also, if a person is color blind, that can be a huge pain. 

"I also almost never see a need to differentiate visited links."

It's essential on many sites...like Craigslist. Not so much on a brochure site. 

"I always want links to open in new windows, at least links to external sites and documents. I am now in the habit of right-clicking on links so I can choose"

Exactly. YOU get to choose. The complaint is sites that make that decision for you (which is rude).

FWIW, when I got going with designing the Excel tables, I was blown away at how wonderful the CSS for tables/tablular data are.

Yes, context is everything. That said, links are usually meant to draw attention, so if that's a bad thing, perhaps that's the wrong place to be putting links (perhaps a side bar or footnotes would make more sense in that context)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">But in the desktop world there's a difference between rolling
over and actually clicking/touching; this is sadly missing from
touch-screens, which is why I eagerly await the arrival of truly
gestural interfaces. Some years ago Microsoft's Surface product
held some promise in terms of "hovering"; I was once on a team
to produce a developer's kit for it, and I remember pushing for
the deep incorporation of hovering. And portable devices might
actually be able to do a poor-man's version via the camera.
