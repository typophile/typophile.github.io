  I was only alive for 1979, so I don\u2019t really know what to change to get away
  from that 1970s feel, unless its just a color thing. \r\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t nick
  me for the stolen sheep dancing across the top; that was <em>not</em> my idea.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BuildingCodes_Cover_6539.png]"

  body: "What about less restraint on the typesize? I think you could get away with
    enlarging those bars with the type in it quite a bit. That way the type, instead
    of the orange background, takes the leading role.\r\n\r\nThe 1970's feel is probably
    because of the colors. To me it doesn't really feel 1970's, but I wouldn't really
    know either because I'm from after 1980. But brown and orange was their thing,
    right? ;)"

  body: "My question would be, why red and orange anyway? Whether or not that's a
    \"70's\" look, it's a pretty harsh combo, and reminds me for of fast food than
    anything.\r\n\r\nI'd think Greens and Blues would be a better palette to work
    from, especially since the content (assuming) is more of a guide to the less than
    exciting world of building to code and the use of permits...\r\n\r\nAlways thought
    the organized cutting mat grid was a nice touch for topics that require a more
    linear approach of thinking (which is usually a foreign thing for creative types.)\r\n\r\nAnd
    I like Jelmar's suggestion, it does seem like the text is floating in a sea of
    orange..."

  body: 'I''d say that''s definitely a 70''s era color scheme. But so are the diagonals.
    That said, the diagonals are a nice part of this composition, so, I''d focus on
    coming up with some more modern color pallets. '

  body: "It does seem to be those bars that's giving it a bit of the 70s look. Remember
    those stripes they used to have in racing cars? \r\n\r\nI think it's a good suggestion
    to be less rigid with the type, does it really have to be all caps?\r\n\r\nBeyond
    that, I wonder if the design really connects with the content of the book. I'm
    not sure what the particular constraints of the project are, but it looks a little
    generic from here. Some sort of content cues may help.\r\n\r\nIt could be an idea
    to break the page into two background bands of white and orange to give it a greater
    sense of structure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

  body: I agree with writingdesigning about breaking the background up, that way you
    would have a horizon to play with.
