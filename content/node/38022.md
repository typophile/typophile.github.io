body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nwww.wallpaper.com\r\n\r\nThe recent redesigned issues of Wallpaper
  have just about removed all vesitages of Matthew Carter's Big Caslon (italic swash,
  sparingly- bold and bold italic); and Charter. I even think they used Alisal too.
  Amplitude is also gone. \r\n\r\nFor text there is a very literary face by Enschede
  (Trinite or Lexicon???). The workhorse sans, a warmer Univers-like-grot is elegantly
  neutral. There is also a new titling face in the vein of Profile.\r\n\r\nWhile the
  new look is certainly fresh it doesn't not come off with same perfect glove and
  hand combination of types as the previous editions of the magazine. I particularly
  do not enjoy seeing the Enschede type there- seems out of place to me- looks better
  in a books if you ask me. Perhaps the new look is a soft beauty as oppose to harsh
  one- something I'm not quite used to yet in bleeding edge fashion and design.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have the scoop on the new fonts and who led the redesign?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike
  Diaz :-)"

    So I'm assuming he probably did a lot of the re-design.

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\n\r\nThanks for your compliments on the sans. It's called Plakat
    (at least for now), and was first seen in <cite>Cond\xE9 Nast Portfolio</cite>,
    a business magazine that launched earlier this year. I had originally intended
    just to use it for my own corporate identity, but it seemed to be the right fit
    for these two magazines when they were looking for warm but relatively character-less
    sans serifs. <cite>Wallpaper*</cite> uses a custom Narrow width, which allows
    them to pack more copy in without taking any space away from the photography.\r\n\r\nThe
    new text face is indeed Lexicon, which I think plays well with Plakat - they're
    polar opposites. It definitely sets a different mood from Charter, but I like
    its quieter tone of voice.\r\n\r\nThe redesign was done in-house by Meirion Pritchard,
    who took over as art director when his boss, Tony Chambers, became editor-in-chief.
    Paul Barnes consulted on the typography and drew the fantastic shaded Antique
    that mainly shows up in the front section."

  body: "Stephen,\r\n\r\nYou could say that Plakat is a revival, but it's not entirely
    based on one specific face. I wrote this bit for Wallpaper* when they were about
    to launch, but they didn't end up using it (because really, who wants to talk
    about type when there's beautiful photography of glamorous interiors and furniture
    to look at?):\r\n\r\n\"Plakat is based in part on Paul Renner's Plak, a relatively
    obscure display typeface cut only in large sizes of woodtype, that is related
    to the boldest weights of his Futura but has rounder, friendlier, fatter proportions.
    For the lighter weights, I was also influenced by the 'me too' sans serifs that
    many, often smaller European foundries released to compete with the juggernauts
    that were Futura, Helvetica and Univers, such as Neuzeit Grotesk, Folio, Recta,
    and Maxima. None of these families were groundbreaking, exactly, but they certainly
    have their charms. In the narrower styles, I was influenced by mid-20th century
    Swiss poster typography. In fact, the name 'Plakat' is German for 'poster'.\"\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I should mention that Big Caslon is still around and used for most headlines,
    but with much less emphasis on the swashes and ligatures in the italic."

  body: "Hi Hector,\r\n\r\nI'm really happy to hear how much you like Plakat. I hate
    to make promises I can't keep, and I'm still working on some of the styles, so
    I'm afraid the best estimate I can give you for when this family will be available
    is \"sometime next year\". <cite>Cond\xE9 Nast Portfolio</cite> has an exclusive
    on the family in North America until April, so it certainly won't be anytime before
    then. Sorry I can't be more specific."
