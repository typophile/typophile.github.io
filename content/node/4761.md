body: Hello folks, <BR> <BR>Getting ready to do an identity for SF&#39;s Chinatown
  Night Market.  They want something that will primarliy appeal to potential corporate
  sponsors, so it&#39;s got to be clean and professional looking etc...  I want to
  make sure though that it doesn&#39;t forget it roots, and that it will somehow capture
  some essence of a Night Market. <BR> <BR>So, I am going to focus on some sort of
  simplified latern treatment for the mark.  But for the type I am a bit stumped.  I
  would like something that it is a contemporary sans-serif, but still hints at Chinese
  brush script. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m including last years logo, which has a traditional
  Chinese brush script.  I think this is a relevant treatment, but it needs to be
  updated to fit their current goals.  Though I like this logo, I think it is perhaps
  a bit too coloquial for their needs. <BR> <BR>Let me know what comes to mind. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks

    That could be useful. The type does nothing for me. Open one of your Indie font
    books and get some inspiration. Oh you don&#39;t have them, get them or get to
    a library.

  body: ' <BR> <BR>&#62; I agree with you Daniel on the type. Its also really busy.
    The funny &#62; thing is, and sort of makes me feel weird about this assignment,
    is &#62; that this logo was designed by one of Senior Designers at Landor. &#62;
    He&#39;s got a whole decade more experience than me at design. I&#39;ll check
    out the indie book. <BR> <BR>Thanks James. I&#39;ll look at that fellow&#39;s
    site.'
