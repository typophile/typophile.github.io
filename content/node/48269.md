  typefaces from a bunch of different books of sheet music. I've managed to find most
  of them, but am stuck on these four. I've tried What The Font, but haven't had any
  luck. Sorry about the poor image quality here--all I have is some hand-held digital
  photos to work from.\r\n\r\nIf you can offer any suggestions I would very much appreciate
  it. Even if it's not an exact match, that's fine. Something close to the original,
  or its spirit is better than nothing. Thanks in advance!"

  body: "Thanks so much. I think you guys are right on for the first three.\r\n\r\nIf
    somebody has any ideas for the last one, I'll be all set. I know the printing
    is giving it some character and there might not be an exact match, but anything
    close would be appreciated!"

    <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Belizio>Belizio</a>, or <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/new-caledonia/>Caledonia</a>
    are in the ballpark?
