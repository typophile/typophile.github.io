  body: "I'm going to the later one too - I'll just be getting there early - which
    is actually what they advised seeing as how people RSVP but won't be paying until
    they get there, which means the flake count will be high, which I'm sure they
    anticipate, which means if you're late your place might be given away...\r\n\r\nBTW
    if you want a shirt make sure to reserve one (not all sizes are left).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
