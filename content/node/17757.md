body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI don't know what's the norm for english or other
  languages, but in portuguese, when one suppresses part of a quoting (for brevity),
  it must be indicated by an ellipsis enclosed in brackets.\r\n\r\nAs I'm typesetting
  my graduation monograph, I have been trying to decide what's the best \"typographic
  detail\" to this. Examples below show three situations:\r\n\r\n1) Bracket / Three
  Periods / Bracket -- The standard when writing, and what most people deliver because
  they write in Word and print from Word.\r\n2) Bracket / Ellipsis / Bracket -- Straight-forward
  replacing the three periods with an ellipsis. This is the first, obvious choice
  when one goes beyong option 1. I like the way the space between each period in the
  ellipsis kind of equals the space from the brackets to the periods.\r\n3) Bracket
  / Thin Space / Ellipsis / Thin Space / Bracket -- This starts to get wide, but in
  a way I like it, because the larger space around the ellipsis kind of emphasizes
  it, and the \"wideness\" of the group seems to reinforce the idea that there was
  more to that particular sentence than what is shown.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this
  kind of decision is that what may look interesting to me (ie. option 3), might be
  annoying to readers. So I would like know what everyone else thinks... other approaches
  are also welcome :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ellipsis-gabriel.jpg]"

  body: "I like number two at first glance, but, because this might be occuring several
    times on a page, you would run the risk of creating light spots, so while retaining
    the ellipsis I would look at making this combination tighter, reducing spaces
    before and after brackets and the space between bracket and first letter (unless
    that is part of the convention). Also are square brackets the norm or can you
    use parentheses, especially if they are lighter overall, as the strong verticals
    are drawing attention to the space.\r\nThe trouble with these is the emoticon
    factor I suppose, it could be perceived as a <a href=\"http://www.artcellarexchange.com/images/artists/haring_monster.jpg\">Keith
