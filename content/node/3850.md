  body: Another nice one, Ricardo. I like the general letter <BR>shapes. They remind
    me of Haapaaranta&#39;s designs... <BR><A HREF="http://209.192.249.179/fonts/fontshow/db.cgi?db=default&amp;uid=default&amp;ID=807&amp;ww=on&amp;view_records=View%2BRecords"

    I love rounded outside corners &#40;they make <BR>me giddy&#41; the bleeding inside
    corners are a bit  <BR>extreme for me &#40;especially in the Regular weight&#41;,  <BR>but
    that may be personal preference, rather than a  <BR>real problem. Also, are those
    notches taken out of  <BR>the right feet on the Bold &#39;M&#39; and &#39;N&#39;
    and bottom of  <BR>the &#39;V&#39; or is it just the GIF file behaving poorly?

  body: ' Ricardo, I really like this face a lot. It&#39;s as if &#34;Bauhaus&#34;
    were to grow up. &#40;At least it&#39;s a more modern take on it&#41;. <BR> <BR>I
    have to agree with Stephen a bit here, that some of the letters are filling in--the
    caps A and M especially. It&#39;s starting to take on an over-inked quality, somewhat
    like FF Blur. <BR> <BR>In both regular and bold it seems like the lc j is too
    thick, or perhaps it&#39;s the descender that&#39;s too curved. Or, perhaps I&#39;m
    just extra sensitive to Js because I have one at the start of my name. <BR> <BR>Good
    luck, <BR> <BR>joe '

  body: ' I agree with Joe, but is it that the lc &#34;j&#34; is too thick, or is
    it that the lc &#34;i&#34; and lc &#34;l&#34; are too thin? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m especially
    fond of the numeral figures. The only other comment I would make on them is that
    the &#34;2&#34; looks a tiny bit narrow next to the other figures. <BR> <BR>Very
    nice. <BR> <BR>David Thometz '

  body: Hello Stephane and sorry about to respond only now. The reson that I prefereded
    included the old style figures on my Focus presentation was to broked the rigid
    and all linning visual references. On my original set I had inclued the linning
    figures, like you can see on this last images to exemplify the idea. Like I said
    on my explication introduction, this type face derive from other my project &#34;Van&#34;,
    which I tryed to change the felling and give a new apperence to this typography
    &#40;mix the old and modern abordage&#41;. All most my type faces Have linning
    figures on my principal set and normaly I <BR>reserved old style figures  to differents
    version. I add the exemples on  a image to show you the other figures. <BR>Thank&#39;s
    for the questions and the encourage.  <BR> <BR>Best regards / Ricardo <BR> <BR><IMG

  body: ' Hello ruben and thank&#39;s to asking for this good pointing. Your pointing
    is not a problem and of course that I like answer to all kind of questions which
    give me other vision about this and other works. The reson of the differences
    betten old style and linnig are because I wanted use the rigid form on linnig
    figure &#40; 1 &#41; without bar. <BR>The version with old style figures I prefered
    used a bar to make a different contrast &#40; simulate serif&#41; and because
    this typography starts from a tipical sans-serif and during the time I had been
    make corrections and change some points that are convencional in this kind of
    family. And of course that I admired this kind of apperence &#40;with bar&#41;
    which I had been thinkig to used on future projects on the linning set. Thank&#39;s
    and regards / Ricardo '
