body: "I am a retired cold-type typesetter. As hot type went the way of the dinosaurs,
  women like me entered the workplace, with our manual dexterity and lower wages,
  along with our lack of upper-body strength, once really a necessity for a typesetter.
  Now designers do their own typesetting and I stay home and blog.\r\n\r\nI am currently
  watching the movie \"Helvetica\". While I am not a big fan of the font, it is certainly
  ubiquitous! There are so many knockoffs it amazes me. Personally, I really love
  Gill Sans, but who even thinks of that these days?"

  body: "I've had the privilege to work in a letterpress shop (perhaps at an age where
    I didn't FULLY appreciate it) but it certainly is an art form that seems to be
    on a consistent level of preservation at the moment. Which is nice to see.\r\n\r\nI
    recall my first internship at 3M in the mid-90s. At the time, they still had a
    typesetting department. In my 4 months there, however, it was finally disbanded.
    The end of an era.\r\n"
