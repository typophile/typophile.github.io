body: ' The new book honoring Hermann and Gudrun Zapf is <BR>wonderful. &#40;sidenote:  And
  it supports my theory of <BR>husband and wife being lovers of the shapes of letters.&#41;
  <BR>   Anyway, as some of the people on this list know me <BR>from school I thought
  it would be fun to admit that as I <BR>was looking at the samples of Optima within
  the book I <BR>found myself actually liking the face. What happened to <BR>it when
  it became digital? The samples in the book are <BR>much less harsh and the contrast
  between thick and thin <BR>is less obvious. I&#39;m assuming that Hermann was involved
  <BR>with the digitization, is this incorrect? '

    Science unfortunately lends itself to na&iuml;vet&eacute;, but the fact that humans
    &#34;fill in&#34; missing information in a uniquely rewarding way is no magic.
    <BR> <BR>Practical consequence of this? <BR>I believe that if loosen the laser&#39;s
    focus on a imagesetter by just a smidgen, readability will increase. <BR> <BR>hhp '
