  am also quite fresh and ripe to typography as well.\r\nI have shaken Bringhurst's
  hand and spoken to erik spiekermann.\r\nI have not yet however read The Elements
  of Typographic Style to completion.\r\n\r\nI would very much like to find a Baroque
  or Renaissance face to pair with a very contemporary sans serif.\r\n\r\nWould you
  be able to lend me some advice?\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nJaz Halloran"

  body: "hey thanks a lot for getting back to me,\r\nOk, well the audience is 20 \u2014
    60 year olds. \r\n(wide audience, yes, but let me explain.)\r\n\r\nIt is an exhibition
    catalogue of 64 pages with vibrant colour images.\r\nCheck out the website: www.
    paintingsbelowzero.com\r\n\r\nThe artist used cutting edge refrigeration technology
    to install paintings into a 400 year old church as part of a fortress in the mountains
    of Northern Italy.\r\n\r\nI would like to achieve a face to represent the history
    of the project as well as one to symbolize new technology.\r\n\r\nWe are producing
    this catalogue to sell at two installations the artist will do January 2007. The
    purpose of this catalogue is also to send out to galleries and institutions in
    hopes that they will comission the artist to install his works in their space.\r\n\r\nOk,\r\nthere
    you go, what is your response,\r\nand thanks,\r\n\r\nJ P H"
