  original, but the character sampling is brief. I cannot find a digital version by
  its original name. It&#39;s called Trooper Roman Bold Extended. From the small sample
  provided, the A, B, E, e, i, l, n, s, t and w are exact matches or extremely close.
  The R&#39;s right leg extends further to the right. Actually, the s and the fact
  that the Broadway-like w are present is what grabbed my attention. <BR> <BR>So ...
  do any of you &#40;Mark, Mike Y&#41;have a better sample image of the Trooper family
  in your old catalogs? If so, might it be a predecessor? Keep in mind that some glyphs
  will surely vary '

  body: It&#39;s some version of Trooper, though not one of the originals. I believe
    there were only two weights, light and roman with italics. This is a bolder weight
    than either. There is a Trooper Roman Black in the Phil&#39;s Photo catalog, but
    there are differences in the characters. Trooper was very popular for a little
    while, so much so that some other film font outfits released there own versions
    with extra weights and styles. This doesn&#39;t quite match any that I&#39;ve
    found. The hairlines are a bit too thin, for one thing. But, it&#39;s not far
    off either. The original &#40;and the knock-offs&#41; had several alternate characters.
    Most of the characters in your sample are the normal ones, some are alternates
    &#40;o, O, and Q&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also, Dave Trooper was the designer. The font
    was originated by VGC.

  body: 'Thanks much for that information Mark. What a very strange combination of
    styles. <BR> <BR>Lookie what I just came across: SoftUnion&#39;s <a href="http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Troover.htm"
    target="_blank"> Troover</a>. Tucked away in the extended characters lie my calligraphic
    g and y, albeit at a lesser weight. I assume that the rotation of the o, O, q
    and Q was, indeed, a Fontbank gimmick. <BR> <BR>Also, a listing at <a href="http://www.atomictype.co.uk/castle_page.html"
    target="_blank"> AtomicType</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.castletype.com/"
    target="_blank"> Castle Type</a>, where Trooper Roman Bold at first seems to not
    be present. It is, it turns out, listed in the <a href="http://www.castletype.com/catalog/CastleType_catalog.pdf"
    target="_blank"> PDF catalog</a> as Trooper Roman and at pretty much the same
    weight as the SSi font. I wonder if Jason Castle made that early enough to have
    been ripped off by Fontbank ... I think I&#39;ll write and ask him. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    again. <BR><br>'

  body: Huh. The Castle Type version looks pretty much exactly like the SSi version,
    more so than the old film font samples I found. Your theory may be right.
