body: "I'm pretty sure the text here was created by an actual typewriter, but I'd
  like to find a close typeface match to this if I can.\r\n\r\nGiven the dates involved
  (February 28, 1964 and February 27, 1984), I'm guessing that it may have been from
  a late-1970s or early-1980s typewriter (?).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Prison-ID-Card_5651.jpg]\r\n\r\nPS
  The attached image is 560px wide, but if it would help, you can also see the full
  1600 x 1200 image here: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lctAFIx94yk/TCx-uysftxI/AAAAAAAAD4E/HW3np1JexdA/s1600/IMG_7678.JPG\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much!\r\n\r\n-- Ashley"
