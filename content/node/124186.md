  created in 2003 by a designer we can no longer locate. This image is the only text
  in the  logo and we have no other samples.   We would like to use the font in a
  sister site we are creating.  Any help you can provide will be much appreciated."

    is one of the few versions of the typeface with a bold weight:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/flareserif-821/\r\n\r\nBut
    I\u2019m not sure if bold is heavy enough to match your sample. Oddly, none of
    the \u201Cofficial\u201D versions of the typeface appear to be available in an
    even heavier weight. You may have to employ another clone, Adelon Serial, to match
    it:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/adelon-serial/"

    almost no possibility that I could have found it on my own.\r\nThank you so much
    for your time, effort and expertise."
