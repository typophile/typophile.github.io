  body: "The war posters really evoked some crazy feelings in me. I can't imagine
    living in a time when literature of that nature was common, and found on any random
    corner.\r\nIf you dig through the parent site for those two pages, you can find
    some more great gems, although it's really difficult to get to some of the content."

  body: "Dan\r\n\r\nWhen I worked at the Weyburn (Sask) Review, I once leafed through
    the archives, and found that during the WWII years, many articles were circled
    in pencil with the words \"Propaganda\" written over them. The publisher of the
    time (who was of the journalist type, not the businessman type) had gone through
    and marked them as such so that future generations would not mistake these for
    \"real news\". Apparently the propaganda machine was quite active then.\r\n\r\nIt
    is the times, no doubt. That may be why the men of that generation have so much
    trouble with war protestors of the 60s and today. (Of course, while I am a pacifist
    myself, I think that WWII is the one war since Waterloo that \"needed\" to be
    fought.)"
