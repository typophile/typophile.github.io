body: 'I am and always have been a Mac user, and have never really understood the
  PC world very well. When generating TrueType fonts for the PC platform I mostly
  let Fontographer do whatever it thought was best.  <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, a font
  of mine apparently has a problem on some PCs. It has two styles: regular and small
  caps. When both styles are installed, only one shows up.  A user reported that she
  could only access Small Caps, but when someone else tried it in XP, he could only
  access Regular.  When only one style is installed, apparently it works properly.
  <BR> <BR>It seems to me that font naming is probably the cause of the problem. Can
  anyone more experienced in the PC world advise me on how to name these fonts so
  that when both are installed they both show up? If I regenerate these fonts in FontLab
  will I have better luck?'

    for the respective family. The family name functions as the menu name.'
