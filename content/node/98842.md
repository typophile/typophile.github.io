body: "Hello,\r\n\r\na friend of mine is a seamstress and, when she gave me her busines
  card, I thought that she needs a logo. The business card is in one of those default
  styles of an online company that makes business cards. Since I am not an expert
  and can not afford to hire one, I took a typeface that I like ([[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/mercury-script/|Mercury
  Script]]), tweaked a little bit and added a needle. I am not sure about those four
  dots but they were in the font...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/4462/g7782.png\"

  body: Nice work. I would eliminate the four dots. Maybe refine the area where the
    /A swash comes close to the /d.

  body: What if, as an alternative to the dots, the "thread" at the bottom were sewn
    (straight stitched) into the negative space? That way you would get a similar
    texture/pattern that was more relevant.

  body: "Nice work, I like your concept.\r\n\r\nThe guys here are on the right track,
    with a little refinement it will go from great to amazing.\r\nThe typeface in
    its current state is a little confusing and can look as if the seamstress doesn't
    know what she's doing and is knotting the thread. Movement is perfect in this
    instance but how about reducing the amount of doubling over the 'thread' does.
    Simplify it a little and maybe run the thread parallel with the bottom of the
    logo.\r\nIncorporate Plume's idea of 'stitching' it in with some negative space,
    four should do it.\r\nDefinitely remove those dots.\r\n\r\nPost up any refinements
    you make, I'd love to see what you come up with."
