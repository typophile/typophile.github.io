  body: "I spent around ten minutes in Photoshop transforming <a href=\"http://www.photoshopstar.com/tutorials/35/stock.jpg\">this
    stock photo</a> (found via Google Image Search) into <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/stock_grainy_4557.jpg\">this</a>.\r\n\r\nIs
    that sort of what you had in mind? Here's a quick summary of how I did it:\r\n\r\nI
    converted the image to CYMK, then copied each CMYK channel into a separate new
    grayscale document.\r\n\r\nFor each of the four new documents, I added two 50%-gray
    layers and set them both to Overlay mode. Then I used Add Noise on each of the
    50%-gray layers followed by Gaussian Blur. I used a different amount of Gaussian
    Blur on each of the two layers: a 1.5-pixel radius for the first one and 0.75
    pixel for the second. The idea was to get two levels of grain: one coarse, and
    one finer.\r\n\r\nThen I flattened all four of the CYMK gray documents and copied
    each one back into the appropriate channel in the original document.\r\n\r\nI
    converted back the image to RGB, then added a Hue/Saturation layer to bring down
    the saturation. Finally, I added a Curves layer to boost the center of the red
    channel and depress the center of the blue channel."

  body: "One thing about P-Shop is that there are usually many paths to the same result.
    Traditionally fast film produces a grain like this on its own.\r\n\r\nNot knowing
    the source of the image makes it largely impossible to give one formula. You may
    also find one formula will give a certain result on a specific image and not another.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=Fast+Film+Grain+Photoshop&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official\r\n\r\nAlso
