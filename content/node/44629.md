  who doesn\u2019t know how to work with long documents in Indesign. I am doing this
  by using copy/paste to break up the stories, but that leaves me with massive amounts
  of formatted overset text that I need to get rid of to prevent problems later. How
  do I just discard all of the overset text in a story?"

  body: "I usually apple+shift+down arrow then delete starting from the desired end
    point in the text. Quark used to have a little chime when you hit the end. It
    is a blind procedure and can take a while to get all the invisible text highlighted.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    someone will have a better solution."

  body: There's also the story editor (cmd-y with text selection) which shows all
    text in a story.

  body: This sounds like a good case for taking advantage of InDesign's scripting
    abilities. I would share a snippet to do this if I had one...

  body: Actually you can burn through 200 pages pretty quickly highlighting a paragraph
    at a time. However, if you are brave, you can always copy the chunk you want to
    save to the clipboard, select all, delete, then past back in.

  body: You can break the stories apart in InDesign and then just export by story.
    No?

    already formatted the entire book in Word, including a bunch of tables, so it\u2019s
    easier to just place the entire document and strip formatting away in Indesign.\r\n\r\n<cite>You

    what I\u2019m doing, but breaking the stories up leaves a lot of extra overset
    copy that I want to get rid of at the end of each story."

    cursor at place where you want to cut the text. Hit Shift-Command-End (that's
    the key with the arrow pointing from upper left to lower right) to select all

    (the key above the one mentioned before) to select all text that has to remain.
    Copy. Next select all text with Command-A, delete, paste copied text in place.\r\n\r\n.
