body: " Hey Typophile \r\n\r\nI have been  fairly inactive for a while but we put
  our typographer shoes on a bit ago and have been dancing and  working on a  stencil
  font that would highlight the spaces in between.  \r\nWe  also realized that the
  space in between doesn't have a name.  Some have tried 'pylon', but that just didn't
  make sense.   We think \" ma\" works  as its that non western idea of the palpable
  \ presence of the metaphysical; like the pause between two notes or the silence
  in the middle of a sentence for dramatic effect.  This concept is imbedded in many
  cultures, why not a font. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we have only  developed the \"Ma\"
  Caps at present.  \r\nWe wold love to know what you think. \r\nWithout further ado.
  \r\n"

  body: "I actually like this concept. It could work really well for Display usage,
    when you want the viewer to look at it a bit longer before they figure out what
    it says. My only suggestion would be to make the serifs a little larger. I get
    the point of keeping them small, but I think you're running the risk of not being
    legible at all.\r\n\r\nKeep going!"

  body: I agree, you need to make the serifs bigger. Even after that you may have
    some legibility issues because of all the awkward white space created inbetween
    the letters. The typeface does have a nice elegance to it at the larger sizes

  body: " minerva, thanks for showing us Sensaway.  Its wonderful.  We were obviously
    \ looking for something very light delicate airy with a lot of white space. \r\n
    We have a lot of work to do yet  but this is incredibly encouraging. Our 5- 9
    numbers are a bit heavy.\r\n\r\n I know we had discussions about this being  above
    24 pt and not really usable at smaller sizes. We would  agree it looses its legibility
    at the smaller sizes.  We are also hoping to be just at that edge of legibility
    enough to  make you think about what you are looking  at rather than just ah yes,
    not quite david carson what is it but very close. \r\nIts one of the reasons behind
    using a Snellen Eye Chart as a type example.  \r\n\r\n Thank you  for the feedback
    so far. We will post updates as we make our modifications.  We are hoping for
    a curious and interesting ampersand... its always the glyph that makes us  excited
    about particular fonts.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Maybe it's obvious, but I have achieved this look by adding white stroke to
    a more conventional typeface.  I think there is something to taking it farther,
    so keep pushing it beyond the simple effect into something compelling.
