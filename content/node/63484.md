body: "For my typeface design class I'm planning on developing a font based around
  this photograph of a sign I found online. Before I begin, I was curious to see if
  it was an actual font, or personally designed for Kenmore Lanes.\r\n\r\nAs I was
  doing some sketches I found it has a similarity to Futura, but the r, k, and e tell
  me it's not.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kenmoretwo_6384.jpg]"
