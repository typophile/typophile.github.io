  just can't find it (see picture). I'm pretty sure it's very popular and I think
  I've seen it in adverts and online a lot - it has something of Cooper Black, which
  is for that matter used in the rest of the titles and rolling credits for that short,
  but it's quite different too - and I just can't pinpoint it.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Thanks
  so much!"
