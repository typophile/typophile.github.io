Look at the example at the bottom of this link:</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;ve seen such things used a the end of articles in magazines, usually in ones that had partial column continuations in the back. They were something simple, though. Most often a square box, sometimes with a simplified logo inside, sometimes with a color. One magazine I read would drop an &ldquo;Ω&rdquo; in that spot. But these were used to separate one article from another. On your poster with a single passage of text, it isn&rsquo;t necessary, and the particular ornament you chose doesn&rsquo;t match the style of the type. If you feel you must put <em>something</em> there, I think a square box would work well enough, especially since you&rsquo;ve established squares as a design theme in the rest of the poster.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I do not feel that an ornament is necessary, but I understand the desire to experiment typographically. If you feel that it makes your design stronger then I say go for it. Sometimes designers can become too ornamental or too clean in their approach. I would hate to look back on my body of work and feel like I had never taken any risks.</p>
<p>In response to your original question, I would use either a period or an ornament, not both. The ornament will act as a &ldquo;termination point&rdquo; for the paragraph by itself. I would recommend not allowing the ornament to hang out beyond the grid directly above it. Eliminating the period will give the ornament some room to tuck in, but some space  should be left around the ornament itself. The last word of the paragraph will becoem illegible if the ornament is too close in proximity.</p>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>
<p>Overall, it looks to me like you could close up your word spacing a bit, it feels loose. This will give you more room for your ornament.</p>
<p>Spacing your text so that there is no hyphenation would benefit your design. It&rsquo;s one thing to hyphenate in a novel, but this is essentially display type on a poster. There&rsquo;s no reason to break the thought.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;INSCRIPCIONES&rdquo; part should also find some placement in your grid, after all the entire poster is a grid so it makes that part stick out. It feels like the type has been stuck there to fill the space.</p>
