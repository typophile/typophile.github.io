  body: "The article fails to mention Apple has supported Windows operating system
    interoperability since PowerPC and perhaps a little prior. There used to be a
    card that Apple or third party used to sell that allowed Windows to run. There
    was 486 card and a Pentium card. That was the old days. Then prior to BootCamp
    we had VirtualPC. \r\nNow Apple is using the Intel architecture (I happen to prefer
    AMD) and we have access to Windows without any expensive emulation enviros. \r\n\r\nIs
    it the best solution? Probably not. \r\nDoes this mean Apple is trying attract
    more developers to MAX OSX? Yes. \r\nDoes this mean Apple will one day try to
    wave the white flag and merge with Microsoft?- NO!\r\nIs Vista trying to accomplish
    what MAC OS X does? Yes.\r\nDoes Microsoft copy Apple? All the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

    is no information yet about the abilities of Intel-based Apple Mac computers and
    whether they will be able to run Vista."
