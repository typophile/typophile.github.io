    on the left, and maybe pulled in a little bit too much. The column of the I seems
    a little top heavy to me. I'm not saying it can't succeed weighted more toward

    it needs to look like a definite decision. I do think you can have subliminal
    stuff that works, but I''m wondering whether if you go further one way or the
    other it will strengthen it. In any case, it looks good already.  '

    Maybe it should be more straight internally, and/or widened. I feel like the I
    needs to pull up his pants a bit--the waist is maybe too low. The 5, should the
    top going into the thin vertical be more like the 7?\r\n\r\nOn the weight of the
    stems, maybe the issue on the caps is the relationship between the vertical and
    diagonal strokes. I don't know of the diagonals should be a little lighter or
    the stems heavier. With heavier stems you'd probably have to adjust vertical arches...

    K has the same issue, and the ball it self doesn't look all that comfortable there.
    Maybe it's leaning out too far to the right? Maybe it's because it's so vertically

    and is a bit distracting. Could you get the weight on both top and bottom, less
    descent, with no ball terminal? Or you could make it more of a showy swash character
    by having both ball terminals. Or alternatives, depending on the use?  \r\n\r\nUnlike
    Lex, I'm not a fan of the t. To me the left side curve is too extreme, and out
    of harmony with the face. In old style faces the rule is that the longer vertical
    strokes are more upright, and that has some visual logic to it. Here your vertical
    angle is rather more uniform, like a Didone. That makes the t look out of place.
    It can lean forward a hair, as the t often does, but here I think it goes too
    far, and is distracting. \r\n\r\nOn my screen your example is really pretty big,
    and the thins still look a little weak. It would be great for what some call a
    'poster' size, but for regular display I don't know. Maybe just having the thick
    to thin be a little less extreme. You to want the roman and italic to play together,
    right? Have you mixed them together? If they work, then ok. \r\n\r\n"

    Check out some swashes on classic typefaces and see what you think about the handling
