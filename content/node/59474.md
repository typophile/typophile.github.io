body: "I just wanted to let folks know that I've posted a proposal [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Jun/0506.html|for
  adding advanced font feature support to CSS]] to the www-style mailing list.\r\n\r\nThe
  basic idea is to enable control of ligatures, alternates, swashes and numerical
  formatting features available in OpenType and AAT fonts within webpages in a relatively
  simple manner.  The proposal lists specific mappings of font-variant-xxx properties/values
  to OpenType/AAT features but I don't expect to get this right the first time, I'm
  sure it will take a few iterations to hone.  I'm especially interested in hearing
  about features omitted or overlooked that folks feel are actually valuable to support.\r\n\r\nAny
  comments/thoughts/ideas would be most helpful, posted here or on the www-style mailing
  list.\r\n\r\nJohn Daggett\r\nMozilla Japan\r\n"
