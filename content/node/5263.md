  body: The purpose of the logo is to convey integrity, quality seriousness, and that
    the company is established. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just after some suggestions of really
    nice serif faces that I could use. I have a few in mind but I may have overlooked
    certain faces, or there may be some I&#39;m not aware of.

  body: Eldorado comes to mind for some reason. It just has that well-dressed business
    look. Or perhaps it would work better on a designer suit label... <BR> <BR><a
