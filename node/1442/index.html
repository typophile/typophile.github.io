  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">David, <BR> <BR>I've started a new thread on this subject so I can't be accused of hijacking someone else's. <BR> <BR>Now that I've thought about it for a whole day and looked over all the Heller texts I have hanging around at home, I can rationalise my feelings to a certain extent. <BR> <BR>In a nutshell, then, I don't like it when a prolific and respected writer abuses his or her position and disseminates their own prejudices/political agenda disguised as critical writing. <BR> <BR>This extract from Heller's <i><b>Designing Hate: Is There a Graphic Language of Vile Emotion</b></i> takes the biscuit as far as I'm concerned: <BR> <BR><i>German Fraktur type (as opposed to other medieval gothics, such as Old English) still evokes iron-fisted authority. The words ULT!, VERBOTEN!, and JUDE! are frightening when spelled out in these letterforms. Actually, anything set in Fraktur, even the most harmless words and phrases, takes on a decidedly ominous look.</i> <BR> <BR>I'm sorry, but this is pure propaganda. He should be ashamed of himself for publishing it. Or maybe the publisher should be ashamed.  <BR> <BR>Anyway, this sort of thing coupled with the tripe in his Swastika book have most definitely turned me off his work.  <BR> <BR>Matha</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You should read his encapsulation of Lebanon's 17-year civil war in his review of the book &quot;Beirut's Memory&quot; in the previous issue of Print. I wrote a letter to Print as a result (my first ever to them), and they'll be publishing it - probably with some &quot;last word&quot; rebuttal by Heller tacked on. <BR> <BR>Although in an email exchange (that ensued as a result of my letter) Heller ended up telling me &quot;we are not on opposite ends of the political divide&quot;, I can't read his mind to know what that really means. <BR> <BR>Some more &quot;context&quot; here <BR><a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup_v2/archives/001291.html#001291" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup_v2/archives/001291.html#001291">http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup_v2/archives/001291.html#001291</a></a> <BR>especially in the comments. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Heller, the person, overall: I think he's more of an asset than a liability. <BR> <BR>But - big but: <BR> <BR>&gt; Have you ever heard of jewish (yes, Heller is <BR>&gt; jewish, so am I) people making propagandist <BR>&gt; statements of the swastika? <BR> <BR>All the time. And for very good reason: it's a superb graphic symbol of the Enemy, hence very useful to keep reminding people to be nice to the [erstwhile] Victim. <BR> <BR>I wish the Turks had such a symbol that we Armenians could use. It can even be argued (based on speeches Hitler made) that the Holocaust wouldn't have happened if we Armenians had such an  enemy symbol available and had used it as effectively as the Jews use the Swastika. On the other hand, media wasn't nearly as good as brainwashing and manipulation as it is now. <BR> <BR>So in a way I understand the Jewish desire to keep it Evil, but I can't stand the duplicity necessary in applying it (even though it's part and parcel of such propaganda), I guess because Jews aren't the underdogs any more. Now they have an underdog, who I guess are in turn lucky to have the Star of David as a symbol with as much potential as the Swastika!  :-/ <BR> <BR>But what really riles me up the most isn't the Swastika treatment, it's the blackletter blacklisting. It is a violation of venerable typographic culture to subjugate blackletter to the Jewish cause (no matter if you think the cause is just or not) the way is done with the Swastika. Leave blackletter alone, so that it may flourish again. <BR> <BR>&gt; To me it just takes big balls to tackle <BR>&gt; such a project and face the consequences. <BR> <BR>What the hell are the consequences when all you're doing is catering the existing power structure?! What would take balls is to publish a book saying the Swastika is socially maligned, that it needs to be give a new chance. <BR> <BR>Same with blackletter. <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/11682.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/11682.html">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/11682.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I am surrounded by it in Finnish bookstores. Thorns are certainly a respectable fence. My past life gave me a great deal of time gardening.

I have never seen it in any Jewish literature, excepting that on the history of the Nazi period. Where you do see it is with those hate groups who like the Nazis, and in Arab political cartoons - where it is regularly pasted on Israeli leaders and the Israeli flag. I don't think they mean it as a compliment. <BR> <BR>The infamy of the Nazi period tarred the swastika for at least a hundred years. Those who use it in the West offend Jews, and know it and don't care.   <BR> <BR>Fraktur is a different matter. I agree that it is not rational (though understandable) to identify it with the Nazis, and it should not be taboo.  <BR> <BR>As to brutal symbolism, I don't like it, but it is not an identifying mark of Naziism like the swastika.  <BR> <BR>I dislike brutal symbolism for the same reason I dislike speech filled with anger.

I know that. You do, I see it in your writings. <BR> <BR>Naturally you are aware that many American blacks find Jews offensive because of their systematic participation in the slave trade? We have not stopped eating bagels though have we? <BR> <BR>Further more what happened to the North American Indian? But we have not given them back their land, have we? Oh, land, but, but, that's much more than a symbol? <BR> <BR>Few people are aware of how many Indians lived in America when the white man came. Few know that the white man used biological warfare on them. And some democracy! I am not sure when the Indians were even allowed to vote. In Canada it was the fifties. Possibly the Canadian Indians got to vote earlier than the American Indians. <BR> <BR>Anyway, how many Indians do you figure there were? Lots! Far more than half of them were killed. So lets not talk so much of symbols. They are not evil. Mankind is evil. Lets get back to the Palestinians, or the Jewish &quot;state&quot;. Heller seems to have much time on his hands. He should do something constructive such as identifying good from evil. The Palistinian question is a short study. But if he simply does not like Germans he should just come out and say so. <BR> <BR>Maybe he is a racist, anyone asked? <BR> <BR>Furthermore the Swastika has great meaning to other cultures. Also it has great meaning to the European cultures. I am not so sure that it should be &quot;swept under the table&quot;. It is offensive to many and it should be. But symbols don't kill people, people kill people. So given Heller's logic we should get rid of people.  <BR> <BR>Those are the issues that should be dealt with, as Henry Kissinger states, the &quot;National Psychiatric of Cultures&quot;. The swastika should remain hanging in every household as a reminder of how terrible man is to each other. Frankly, I do not think things should be forgotten in 100 years, if ever. <BR> <BR>Furthermore, most of those illustrations, particularly the first set that Matha exhibited are indeed just plain ugly. They are offensive just because they are. Ugly! <BR> <BR>But I could design a swastika that is beautiful and meant as such. Not only that but I would have spiritual justification for doing so. I could also print a beautiful book in Fraktur. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, <BR> <BR>sorry. since he studied history. ans since - i guess - he is teaching history  - you can't just post &quot;Steven Heller and Prejudice&quot;   without knowing the real history of the Swastika!!!! <BR> <BR> <BR>and he didn't post, let's say : The Swastika and Prejudice. <BR> <BR>and then compare what Heller wrote. What Quinn wrote. etc. etc.  and then. and only then - we all can learn about the issue. and REALLY talk about  prejudice!!!! <BR> <BR> <BR>[if you want i can email you about the books - but not here] <BR> <BR> <BR>David Hamuel</div>
