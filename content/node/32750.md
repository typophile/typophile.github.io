    k, I think I would look at larger counters on the k and e, the i looks a bit lonely
    and differently styled, the absence of lower serifs on other characters are contributing
    to this.\r\n\r\nTim"

    What's the audience/company you're creating this for? I don't think we have enough
    information to give a true creative critic on the word mark. Do you have any previous
    idea sketches? "

    it's on the first place a very different letter than all the other round ones
    in the logo? If not what do you think would make the whole thing tighter? Make
    it connect like an italic (while keeping it upright) would be one solution I guess.\r\n\r\nThe
    logo is for an upscale hair salon (I was starting to like the guessing game).
    Ornament is part of what the client enjoys. And part of what inspired us too.
    Here are a couple of sketches. I decided to render the sketch for the first rendered
    post really soon in the sketch process so I don't have many other things to show.
    But here it goes.\r\nThanks\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JackieT-Rabiscos-2007_5545.03.29.jpg]"

    I don't really get that feeling from this word mark. I admit it's a clean start,
    but I think it could be pushed further to get that ornamental feel. You need to
    keep in mind your audience is old rich women, this mark should feel RICH and EXPENSIVE.
    I like your sketches, there are some good ideas in there but honestly, I think
    you're going with the safe choice, keeping it simplistic. \r\n\r\nAnyone else
    feel the same way, that he could be pushing this design further and that it's
    currently newlywed wife rich, but not widowed millionaire rich?"

    swashy leg, it's a shame because I like the loop, but currently I cannot think
    of a better way to bring the i into the design. To add to the expensive (and hair)
    look you could combine one of the features in your sketches, the double line,
    a bit like Delphian, see if it is possible to keep the thin look though.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=delphian\r\n\r\nTim"

    and I think you're right. As for the ornament, it's still a work in progress,
    and this is one of other paths we're trying (I do tend to go simple and I need
    to work that out). Also, we still have to work out the \"T\" in Jackie T and we
    could go crazy on that (We've been researching a lot of ornamental designs, old
    and contemporary in order to get the ornaments just right). But you're definitely
    right when you say I have to add more flair to it. Will do! Check back soon with
    changes and hopefully new stuff!\r\n\r\nTim, I like that bowl too, let's how it
    looks without it and if it's better, than I still have a bowled k to make an alternate
    for Jackie T's typeface :D Also the Delphian feature is a nice suggestion, but
    I'd say I'd still need more flair. Maybe some Marian Bantjes' stuff (www.bantjes.com)
    would come in handy for the logo (though I'm not sure I could pull that off lol).
    Let's see how it goes"

    and I hope to correct the terminals real soon (I like C's ball terminal best too).
    I'm also not sure what to do with the serif on the J... it might need to be on
    both sides to sort of balance it (like a normal serifed capital J). Lowercase
    e might need more personality and I'll fiddle with that too.\r\n\r\nPaul, what
    interested me about the T was the fact that the arms (can't remember the typographic
    term for it now) are sort of bending up a little making it more triumphant. I
    saw a little bit of a female (with a moustache though heheheh) now (small head
    up the middle) and that'll be another card we can play if it comes up on the discussions...\r\n\r\nAll
    in all, we're very excited on how this is coming along, and the process of posting

    together in a 1970s kind of way. However I see a huge disconnect between the two.
    The logo on your April 16 post reads \"Jackie\" to me, like an American ad girl
    with long straight hair and big eyes sitting bare-breasted (all ad girls were
    bare breasted in the 1970s) atop an ancient, vaguely Spanish pedestal. Obviously
    it's a T, but it's a T which does not belong to Jackie. Jackie is a tourist, posing
    with a T from another culture and time. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, to bring them together,
    you would have to start from scratch with either Jackie, or the T.\r\n\r\n-marian"

    in the logo for small output version, the c and e look too high off the baseline.
    Compared to the ki combo, the c and e could be lowered a tad to optically compensate.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    in the small version on the bottom right corner, the letters could be tracked
