<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>There has been some chatter about the new Guardian re design set
to launch on Monday.
News Designer has a few pics here:
http://www.newsdesigner.com/blog/
And the Guardian itself has released a pdf and background here:
http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1566474,00.html
Any word on the (what seems) custom type?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I think it's custom; I've never seen it before. I like it a lot; sturdy, versatile, clean, economical, yet attractive. One nice touch is the spur on the a which appears when needed (text) and in decks but is not present in display cuts such as the light. I'd like to see the italics. If anyone has more info or specimens, please post.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is quite good. Austere, honest, great proportions, great finish, trapping, hybrid nums. FontBureau? I just wish they'd used the terminal-less "a" for body - it's [even] more needed there. I just hope the Italic isn't wussy.

<div class=commentbody>Whilst I think that the redesign is a whorthwhile aesthetic change; it certainly feels contemporary, and it's refreshing.
However the new text type sparkles just that bit too much, it's harder (for me) to read. This may be caused by the stock that today's teaser was printed on, which I felt was too bright (also too heavy). Monday's Guardian might not be on the same stock.
There is also the claustrophobic feel of a massive x height with too little leading. Looks like it's been designed with the visually impaired in mind. I 'll get used to this.

<div class=commentbody>My guaranteed fall-back for hard-to-find magazines and newspapers is Bungalow News in Pasadena - it's pretty amazing. But for The Guardian chances are good I'll find it in Glendale. Plus I'll be making a trip to UCLA on Monday, and Westwood has great kiosks. Am I a type geek or what?! - getting excited about hounding an issue of a newspaper... for the type.
Miles, maybe 9.5 point is too big for such a big x-height?
But I need to see the thing in person.
BTW, how do I get a physical copy of that "teaser"?
Somebody on the ATypI list said it was in the Saturday edition - correct?

<div class=commentbody>Yes, the teaser is an insert in today's (Saturday's) Guardian. I don't know whether it's included in the international edition or not.
The back page of the main broadsheet is entirely blank except for the (large, black, centred) words <em>The</em><strong>End</strong> in the style of the old masthead; and in the bottom-right corner, in colour Guardian Egyptian, it says

<div class=commentbody>Oh, 8 point sounds much better. As for the leading, and other things like wordspaces etc., what seems to happen way too often is that when the day comes to actually set real articles in a real issue, all the fine-tuning and refining during testing can get ignored...
Alert: I'm having trouble tracking down the Saturday edition, at least over the phone (goddam paleolithic technology). So if somebody is willing to put aside a copy for me (and maybe do the same on Monday) I would of course pay for it/them and the shipping. hrant_thatsymbol_inverselogic_dot_com

<div class=commentbody>I'm disappointed by the all-serif look.
I felt the same way when the Toronto Star, also a leftish paper run by a foundation, rather than a media conglomerate, was recently redesigned with all serifs.
Somehow, it signals a pandering to "taste", a movement away from a hard-line stance, whether or not that is the editorial drift.
My initial impression (which may nonetheless be revised once I see it on newsprint) is that the newly refined look will be at odds with the necessarily blunt messages that this newspaper, so frequently critical of the establishment, must carry.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, maybe what the anti-establishment movement now needs is a measured, rational voice? Although the wedge serif is quite "hand-line", second only to the full-flat true Egyptian serif in that respect; I would agree that adnate serifs with cupped ends (think Goudy, or Worldwide) for example would have been off. And does dissent have to be tasteless? Also, when it comes to the body face at least, a serif font is a strict requirement for adequate readability in such conditions.

<div class=commentbody>The front page design, with the masthead halfway down the folded berliner cover looks very well designed <a href=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-video/Media/video/2005/09/09/guardian_new_thinking.mpg>(see the TV advert)</a>
It means the paper can't be folded again without folding it along the masthead, so newsagents will have to display it as it comes.
This also leaves a very dynamic space for a headline or picture that is visible with the paper folded.
The column width is good, much more readable than old eight-column broadsheet.
But - there are still lots of line-end words broken with hypens on the dummy copy (re-main, investi-gated ver-sion, for-mat, newspa-per, jus-tice, pa-per) that make it harder to comprehend the writing.
Not something you see on their website!</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I'm getting used to it.
The typeface is OK. A bit like Cartier, eh?
Perhaps the serifs could have been a bit narrower, in the headline fonts, for a slightly closer fit, given the tightness of the layouts and the small wordspace.
I find the G2 section is too small in size. There is a problem that with the smaller formats and the larger pictures, the fancy colors and light weights, that the paper loses gravitas. This is particularly evident when you have one story dominating a page and it's got a big stock photo -- that ain't news! Looks more like a cheap magazine: but that is something that the facility to put big colour pictures everywhere sucks you into, and unique to the Guardian.
The big double-page photo spread every day is brilliant.
Overall, I am still concerned that a serious anti-establishment paper should carry some clout. The Guardian was big and tough, but now it is proud to leave behind that daunting presence (as charged by focus groups, no doubt) to be friendlier -- smaller, prettier. I have the same problem with the little Independent and its frilly Century heads. Easy to discount.
Please tell me I'm wrong, and that these toy dogs barking at the powers that be will not be contemptuously kicked aside.

<div class=commentbody>Despite my concerns, I'm really enjoying the redesign and the new typeface.
One benefit of the new face is that you don't get the situation that often occurred before where an ad set in Helvetica would get mixed up with editorial set in Helvetica. In fact, what's happened with newspaper design in the years since the Guardian's previous makeover is really quite amazing, now that so many papers have comissioned their own typefaces.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Custom type designs rarely get public specimens. Except when the exclusivity expires (often 2-3 years) and the designer(s) can start selling it on their own.

<div class=commentbody>It doesn't seem to be available for download yet, but I heard Christian on [[TypeRadio]] (from Helsinki) and he discussed some of the process behind this design for the Guardian, it was very good.
*Update* The interview is now available <a href=http://www.typeradio.org/loudblog/>here.</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>Normally, I agree with most of the people that I disagree with on this topic, but I find nothing bold, innovative or even appealing about the new Guardian. I worked in newspapers for many years and had a hand in a few redesigns, and this one seems to miss on all cylinders.</div>

<div class=commentbody>As a newspaper, the look is uninviting, out-dated and heavy-handed, and does nothing more original in layout than, say the Citzen (Auburn, NY)and the Detroit Free Press did (much better) 10 years ago (see The Best of Newspaper Design Fifteenth Edition).</div>

<div class=commentbody>I find it works well and once I got over examining the font it reads well too. Is the purpose of a redesign to be groundbreaking and original; or to make the reading experience easier and more pleasant and ensuring that the layout does not deter from that?

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Why do you think that is? If we concede that the design can be improved then two obstructions have to be overcome time is the major constricting factor, closely followed by cost – the market share for newspapers has been reduced by newer, more instant, cheaper and generally easier* media.
*By easier, I mean why bother reading a newspaper when a man or woman in a suit will read it for you in the corner of your living room.
The technologies involved in newspaper production – printing (colour, inks), layout software, paper manufacture etc. have all improved in terms of speed and quality and this is clearly the case compared to a decade ago.
Newspaper's budgets are mainly allocated to the content (the reporting) and production. Since even media barons cannot expand time, cost is the only area that can be squeezed, so, for example, there is a limit to the amount of non-printed space, the remaining number of employees have to be able to produce the product.
To sum up, if the paper is to survive, it cannot afford to lose its loyal readers, who want the content and will not pay (much) more, and the consumables and wage bill keep a constant then something has to give and that casualty is design. I don't envy anyone trying to redesign a newspaper within these constraints.

<div class=commentbody>I don't envy them either, when you consider the parameters that should be worked within, although from experience, I can tell you it's an incredible opportunity for a designer who really takes it seriously as a communication problem.</div>
