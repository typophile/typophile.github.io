  debate on &#39;evil&#39; blackletter made me polish it off for critique. Didn&#39;t
  really know what else to do with it <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: It&#39;s not evil if you&#39;re not National Socialist about it. And you&#39;re
    not - more 70&#39;s young-adult book cover, especially in the leading caps. This
    is NOT a slam - that stuff is printed nice and clean into my memory. <BR> <BR>For
    my two cents, it&#39;s missing a bit or two on all the character bottoms. Nicely
    cleft to the pen, but a little light in the &#149;&#149;&#149;. Hit that and we
    can spend all day cutting and pasting in Gutenberg text just for the visual kick.
    <BR> <BR>Make sense? cos I&#39;m too dr&#42;&#42;k to post an edited GIF. ;]
