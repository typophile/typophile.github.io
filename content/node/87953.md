body: Some fonts have straight quotes that hang flush from the cap height, others
  they straddle it, and on rare occasions they float below it. I can understand the
  rationale for the first two, but is there some reason for hanging the straight quotes
  noticeably low, as in Univers? Or it is just a stylistic decision?

  body: "Isn\u2019t the rationale in Univers that the lining figures are designed
    slightly lower than full caps, and thus straight quotes align on figs? \r\n\r\nAssuming
    one is using proper typographic quotation marks, then the straight quotes are
    most likely to be pressed into service for feet/minutes and inches/seconds directly
    following numerals."

  body: "Two possibilities occur to me: A) plausible, but less likely: the alignment
    is an attempt to more or less match the placement of guillemots; and B) more practical:
    lowering the quotes makes for fewer kerning pairs. Lowering the quotes eliminates
    the need to kern with round characters (\u201CO\u201D). An elegant solution or
    laziness? Hard to say\u2026"
