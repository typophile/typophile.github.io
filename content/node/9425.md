  body: Novel idea having someone actually &#34;purchase&#34; a font.   <BR>HelvNeue
    is quite popular though so perhaps the assumption is that many people interested
    in more advanced use of Keynote would be either likely to own H&#39;Neue already
    or not balk at buying it. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: Uh, but it is included with Mac OS X. Have a look at <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/font.html">the
    bundled fonts</a> that come with Mac OS X.
