  modern and can exist with out the superfluous s on the end.\r\n\r\n<strong>but</strong>
  why does it feel natural to use both in the same sentence. I could have just gone
  with one of the two options above but I thought I would see if anyone had an opinion
  on this.\r\n\r\nSo, I am proposing a style where in the <strong>first instance the
  singular</strong> is used and for the <strong>last instance in a sentence plural</strong>\r\nBTW
  when I refer to points as a size of a type the number is a figure.\r\n\r\nhere is
  another example:\r\n\r\n<cite>A \u20189 on 12 point body\u2019 describes a type
  usual to a 9 point body which is cast onto a body three points larger.</cite>\r\n\r\nAny

    apply to type sizes.\r\n\r\nThe first size in your example, \"4.5 point\", is
    a specific size. The next, \"21 points\" is more of a general description than

  body: "I'd say it's a matter of nominal vs. adjectival forms. In adjectival forms
    with units of measure, you use the singular (e.g., \"20-dollar bill\"). When used
    as a noun, the unit of measure takes the plural with numbers other than one (e.g.,
    \"it costs 20 dollars\"). So <em>A series of seventeen Didot fonts sized between
    4.5 point and 21 points </em> is not correct, because both instances are functioning
    as nouns rather than adjectives, whereas <em>A \u20189 on 12 point body\u2019
    describes a type usual to a 9 point body which is cast onto a body three points
    larger</em> is correct, because it uses singular where the number plus unit function
    as an adjective modifying a noun, and plural where the unit is used as a noun.\r\n\r\nIt
    might be different sometimes in a language that has plural adjectives, assuming
    it allowed such constructions.\r\n"

  body: "Almost there. The shift to singular happens when the measure is part of a
    compound adjective that modifies a noun. Compound adjectives should also be hyphenated:
    a 3-inch nail, an 80-year-old man, 12-point type.\r\n\r\nThe measure stays plural
    if it's in a phrase on the other side of a verb. Then it's modifying an adjective.
    The actual adjective of the phrase is sometimes missing but implied: \"The race
    is ten miles\" really means \"The race is ten miles <em>long.</em>\"\r\n\r\nNow,
    some fudging occurs when people start to think of a compound adjective as one
    that can be used where any other adjective can. Arguably, you can say \"The type
    is 12-point\" as easily as the \"The type is black.\" But it's an unusual way
    to say things in most situations; we don't say \"The race is ten-mile.\"\r\n\r\nSo
    let's look at your example.\r\n\r\n\"A series of fonts sized between 4.5 points
    and 21 points was founded.\"\r\n(\"was\", not \"were\", because the subject is
    \"A series\".) I would argue that the word \"sized\" demands this form. \"This
    font is sized to 21 points\" is like \"This building was built 21 floors tall.\"\r\n\r\nI
    think that use of \"sized\" is awkward anyway. I would say:\r\n\"A series of fonts
    between 4.5 points and 21 points in size was founded.\"\r\n\r\nYou could also
    say:\r\n\"A series of fonts from 4.5-point to 21-point was founded.\"\r\nThis
    treatment of adjectives is similar to that in such phrases as \"all creatures
    great and small\".\r\n\r\nAbove all, measurements listed together as the same
    part of speech should be in a consistent form, no matter how much more \"specific\"
    you think one number is than the other!\r\n"

  body: "If developing a 'house-style' for usage do you think it would be good to
    differentiate between size (as dimension) and physical state?\r\n\r\n[Updated
    from top] So far when referring to points as a 'physical state' of a (metal) type
    the number is a figure. [i.e. 7-point type]. (Is referred to in singular, and
    is hyphenated)\r\n\r\nSo with the convention of writing out numbers as words in
    running text helps identify a size (as dimension) [i.e. three points larger] clearly
    differentiating from the 'physical state' which uses a figure [i.e. 7-point type].\r\n\r\n<cite>A
    \u20189 on 12-point body\u2019 describes a type usual to a 9-point body which
    is cast onto a body three points larger.</cite>\r\n\r\nConcerning sizes (as a
    dimension of scale)\r\n<cite>...investigating features considered extraordinary
    or specific to the design of a typeface concerned with reproduction and legibility
    at sizes less than 7 points.</cite>\r\n<strong>becomes</strong>\r\n<cite>... and
    legibility at sizes less than seven points.</cite>\r\n\r\nSo taking two quotes
    (that I won't change in the text (as they are are quotes) but will apply the 'house-style'
    rules here for clarity are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Quote</strong>\r\n<cite>The
    process was reversed for the large sizes, 18 points and larger, where legibility
    was not a problem and an aesthetic motive could apply.</cite>  [Walter Tracy]\r\n<strong>would
    become</strong>\r\n<cite>... for the large sizes, 18-point and larger, where legibility
    was not a problem and an aesthetic motive could apply. </cite>\r\n\r\n<strong>Quote</strong>\r\n<cite>Shorted
    descending and ascending strokes are unforgivable on bodies over 18 points. It
    is quite legitimate to shorten the tails of the small fonts [lowercase] to increase
    legibility and to lengthen them in the display size of the same face for the sake
    of elegance.</cite>  [Harry Carter] \r\n<strong>would become</strong>\r\n<cite>...on
    bodies over 18-point.</cite> (as is descriptive of the physical body of type)\r\n\r\nSo
    far so good?"
