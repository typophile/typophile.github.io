  body: "This type of font can be made by cutting serifs on a Didot and making some
    other edits. \r\nCan't recall off hand if this one is a bespoke font for New York
    Magazine. If so, presumably it would have been made by legitimate means, i.e.
    from scratch or a scan of a printed Didot specimen rather than from an existing
    digital didot.\r\nAnother sans serif Didot\r\nhttp://www.typographyserved.com/gallery/Sans-Serif-Didot/2135920\r\nLink
