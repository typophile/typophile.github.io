body: "Dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nWe recently released U8, a new typeface designed by
  Anton Koovit that has taken him through the Berlin subway system to research the
  signs used on the line 8 (U-Bahn 8 = U8 as it is called in Berlin). \r\n\r\nBelow
  is the slightly more formal presentation text, as well as some images.\r\nAlso note
  that all our typefaces can now be downloaded in trial versions. \r\nDon't hesitate
  to give them a try.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.fatype.com/fatype/U8_650/U8_1.jpg\"

  />\r\n<img src=\"http://www.fatype.com/fatype/U8_650/U8_9.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nWe are
  very pleased to present the latest addition to our growing collection of retail
  typefaces: U8, a new geometric sans serif, with seven weights, designed by Anton
  Koovit.\r\n\r\nAnton started U8 as a research project about the Berlin subway system
  signage and particularly the U8 line that connects the northern borough of Reinickendorf
  with Neuk\xF6lln in the south of the city, through the Alexanderplatz junction.
  His goals were to restore a piece of history, research a link between the DIN and
  Bauhaus, and translate the lettering of individual handcrafted station signage into
  a formal typeface. Apart from the regular weight\u2019s upper and lower case, glyphs
  such as numbers, and other weights, had to be created by the designer, allowing
  for his contemporary interpretation. The result is an early modernist typeface,
  with wider proportions than most common geometric sans, a strong character, and
  a clean design. Initially intended for display purposes, U8 has proven to work well
  in text sizes. The typeface comes with a full character set for western and eastern
  european languages, and a number of OpenType features such as ligatures, smaller
  figures for text, tabular figures and fractions. Italic styles will also be released
  in a few months.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fatype.com"
