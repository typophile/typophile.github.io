body: This is the first time I have used this board. I came across the forums while
  looking for another font. So I decided to try this out to see if you guys can help.
  I am a designer and I am looking for this particular font, it is used on the <a
  href="http://www.gulfstream.com" target="_blank">www.gulfstream.com</a> site. Please
  take a look at the image I have attached. The font is used in the navigation, and
  is the font used in the headline &#34;Redefining Comfortable Travel. <BR> <BR>Thanks
  for your help!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37459.jpg" alt="font
