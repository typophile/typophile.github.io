  posters back in the 1950's and 1960's. \r\nI'm aware of particular styles from those
  decades but cannot pinpoint too many exact typefaces used. \r\n"

  body: He's saying to the lindsayfox post is spam; her first post was a promotion
    of her site, which is a commercial site that's unrelated to typography.

  body: The Lucy Strike ad is most likely from before World War II -- you can tell
    by the green packaging. One of their ads early in WWII was "Lucky Strike Green
    has Gone to War" -- and they changed to a white package.

    the Google 1950s filter does not exclude ads from other decades so you have to
    check them one by one. When you find an ad from the collection that is indeed
    a 1950s ad you have a good chance of duplicating the fonts in it. Some of the
    word logos on major cigarettes, such as Marlboro, have been made into fonts. By
    the 1950s much of the display lettering in ads used fonts rather than being hand
    lettered as in earlier decades. If you do not recognize the fonts in a particular
    ad, I suggest you send a request, with the image, to the Font ID forum at http://typophile.com/typeid\r\nDon"
