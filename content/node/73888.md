  of the free fonts (SIL license) I have tried have a huge default leading (probably
  because of the numerous scripts they support, or the designer taste?).\r\n\r\nI
  would like to know if setting a negative leading (e.g. line-spacing proportional=80%,
  or line-spacing fix=0.45 cm) in the paragraph style is custom practice or not? If
  it is not, I will search for other fonts with a \"regular\" default leading (well,
  I am used to increase the leading with traditional fonts).\r\n\r\nUsage: writing
  reports to print on paper or pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Have you tested with other applications? IIRC, OpenOffice was, erroneously,
    using the WinAscent/Descent values of the OS/2 table to compute line height, where
    it should be using the TypoAscent/Descent values. So I think you should reported
    that as an OpenOffice bug, and use the negative leading if it works for you (I
    myself stopped using office suites long ago, it is just to fragile and unpredictable
    for me to use, if I were you, I'd go with some TeX based solution; LaTeX, ConTeXt
    or even Texinfo depending on your particular needs).

  body: "Khaled, thanks for the feedback. I don't use LaTeX. I will search for the
    OOo bug \"OOo uses WinAscent/Decent values of the OS/2 table instead TypoAscent/Descent
    values\". Eventually, I will open one.\r\n\r\nI have tried the fonts in Scribus,
    and the result is the same: The default leading is important. I might contact
    the font designer. BTW some of the fonts are TeX fonts from Gyre.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'd try some standard application first, e.g. Gedit, if it gives the same
    interline spacing, then it likely that how the font is designed, but in professional
    typography, you always adjust line spacing your self and not relaying on font
    embedded values.

  body: "Khaled, good point about Gedit, although it returned (to my eyes and at my
    screen def.) the same leading value as OOo does. I know about setting the leading,
    but I was not positive as setting a negative value. Usually the fonts have a minium
    default leading to increase according to the needs.\r\n\r\nJ. Tillman, no I did
    not know that (I thought \"compact\" was referring to the font with a different
    \"tracking\") so, thank you for your information, Charis SIL is one of the fonts
    in question (the other fonts are tex gyre fonts: Latin modern, Heros (copy of
    URW nimbus sans L) and Adventor (copy of URW Gothic L).\r\n\r\nWhen I compare
    these fonts leading with others, their default leading is huge. I was wondering
    why?"
