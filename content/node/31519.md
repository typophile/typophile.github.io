  body: "I think it looks like a custom, simplified blackletter.  <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.734.0.0\">FF
    Brokenscript</a> has some similarity, but I think maybe <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/caligra/\">Caligra</a>
    feels closer in more respects, if you just make it wider.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
