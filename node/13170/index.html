  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Sorry for the vanity of making such a post, but I figured that some of you might like an update.</p>
<p>In real life, things are incredibly chaotic. Meetings and other similar sessions as part of my divorce are burning up an enormous amount of time (and money too, naturally). By next Friday, I will have had eight separate meetings over a period of nine days. So if you&rsquo;re feeling miffed that you&rsquo;ve sent me email and I haven&rsquo;t responded, rest assured it&rsquo;s nothing personal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my curve editor project is coming along very nicely. After having redone the math from the ground up, I now have a fairly polished C implementation that&rsquo;s plenty fast enough for interactive use; it&rsquo;s even more responsive, in fact, than my previous Cornu-based version. I need to be a bit discreet about details so as not to screw up patent rights, but people with access to Linux / X11 running on MacOS and who are really curious about the new stuff may find it rewarding to contact me. In any case, I hope to be able to make a wider release in a couple months or so when life settles down, and, with luck, a patent is filed.</p>
<p>Even the concept of &ldquo;spare time&rdquo; is alien to me right now, I have found drawing some letters to be very peaceful, relaxing, and sustaining. I now have twenty-four of the 60-pt metal Centaur lowercase letters drawn, in addition to half a dozen from the Imprimerie Nationale&rsquo;s Christian Gothic and a handful of others. I find that the new curve editor lets me get to <i>vastly</i> better results in a fraction of the time as a Bezier-based tool.</p>
<p>In all, I kinda feel like I&rsquo;m in a cocoon right now, preparing to come out in a little while. Greetings from inside!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Raph, thanks for the update. This is then a good time for me to express my gratitude for your recent bursting onto the type scene. Your particular multi-disciplinary angle is most valuable to the field. Good luck managing your time, although it seems you have as best a handle on it as possible. And I can&rsquo;t wait to try out your outline editing software; will you have a native-Windows version too?</p>
