  characters to Penumbra, Odense and Friz Quadrata. The main feature I'm looking for
  is the half serif or flared serif.\r\n\r\nPenumbra:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/penumbra-half-serif/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/penumbra-flare/\r\n\r\nOdense:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/odense/semi-bold/\r\n\r\nFriz

  body: 'I second William''s suggestion of ITC Elan; ignore the sometimes weird lowercase
    and set a line of caps in one of the type testers. Very elegant caps. Albert Boton
    has actually designed 3 different typefaces in this category: Elan, Agora from
    Berthold, and Memo. Also check out his recent FF Page Serif, which has low contrast
    and chisel serifs. For that matter, his Pompei has more contrast, but also tiny
    flare serifs. It reminds me a little of Perpetua. '

  body: 'Thanks for posting the link to Areplos. It is a fascinating design, experimental
    but very disciplined and successful, without any of the ''frankenstein'' character
    of some of the post-modern stuff. The story in the PDF on the Storm is interesting.
    I wonder if it influenced Rotis? '

  body: "William Berkson> Your welcome. According to the linotype website, Rotis was
    designed in around 1988. But I wonder if there was non digital Rotis types prior.
    so maybe Areplos was first!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"
