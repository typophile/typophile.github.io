  where we also get lessons in constructing typefaces. This year we had to make our
  first complete typeface (capitals, lowercase and limited interpunction)\r\nI already
  have all the capitals and lowercase characters on paper, but I just recently started
  to digitize them. Haven't gotten very far yet, but I was curious about your opinions,
  so I'll just post what I've got so far.\r\n\r\nI'll post more when I've got some\r\n\r\n\r\n--
  Update --\r\n\r\nI replaced the image with a PDF containing all caps except for
  the T,Z and Y. I didn't pay d=that much attention to the spacing so please forgive
  me of it's crooked.\r\n\r\n-- Update --\r\n\r\nOk, new update. \r\n\r\nI've digitized
  all my characters. Only the capital T and lowercase F are missing. Had some second
  thoughts about those. The new file is Quick.pdf\r\n"

    I did not know this browser had that function.\r\n\r\nThe font reminds me a bit
    of Eras if it were a sort of script style and bowed to the left instead of right,
    but still with the rightward tilt. "

  body: Wonderful! Not sure about "H" though. It looks a bit too much like a reversed
    "N". I'm also looking forward to see the lowercase.

    caps seem pretty solid, I share Jos' comment on the H. H is rather wide in comparison
    to O as well.\r\nAlso I would consider reducing contrast in H, K and X.\r\nO looks
    a bit odd with the interruption, you might consider leaving O and Q uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!\r\nArtur\r\n"

  body: "Thanx for the comments. I can see what you mean with the O. It get's a bit
    messy maybe. \r\nWhen I started this typeface I had a couple of rules wich I based
    all the characters on. The most important one was that I wanted all characters
    to look like they could be drawn in one fluent motion with just one line without
    the line crossing itself. \r\nObviously I had to make a few concessions. But maybe
    I have to make a few more. The capital and lowercase 'T' don't work with my concept
    in mind (which you'll see soon hopefully).\r\n\r\nI'll try levelling the bar on
    the H a bit so it doesn't look as much like a mirrored N. Also agree that the
    X K could use a tiny bit more contrast."

  body: "> maybe I have to make a few more.\r\n\r\nInstead of making awkward concessions
    it would be better to simply dump your original requirement and move into type
    design (as opposed to lettering) in earnest. You have good forms going - let those
    guide you, instead of some imaginary irrelevant factor.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    but I think you've created a set of 'rules' for yourself with the capitals, with
    which you can make a pretty interesting lowercase."

    and you are, of course, absolutely right. I still stuck to my concept but let
    it go where it just didn't work. I'm pretty happy with the results so far. There's
    some kinks that I can see for myself but another pair of eyes are much appreciated.\r\nI
    traced all the characters in Illustrator, so the spacing is done by hand and without
    very much care so again, apologies for that.\r\n"

  body: I think the lowercase is coming together quite nicely. Why didn't you use
    that lovely double-story g that is sitting on the lower right corner of the page
    in some words/sentences? I like that one alot. :)

  body: Thanx. That double-story g was the inspiration for the whole of the typeface,
    but after a while it just didn't fit in anymore. I was heart broken cause it was
    my favorite character, but yeah. As my teacher put it "Kill your darlings'. So
    I did, but I just couldn't resist digitizing it anyway. It's sitting kinda lonely
    down there though.

    the exceptions, you should stay close to your rules, or you can easily drift off
    of your original purpose. \r\n\r\nLooks to me like you are doing quite well. The
    \"i\" without a dot is distracting though. \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

  body: "The round forms have an awkwardness to them. The curves are not a fluid as
    they could be. The proportions of the uppercase appear random and should be attended
    to. THe N is too wide the K too narrow, the H does not appear to function as an
    H. The weights are oddly place and the tops seem too heavy to me.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase
    is more successful although the m and n appear too wide. The word space is enormous."

  body: "Forgot to mention I haven't had the time to include a dot on the i yet :p.
    It will be included though.\r\n\r\n@Terminaldesign,\r\nI agree with some of your
    points and others I don't understand.\r\nDo you think all round forms have an
    awkwardness to them? I tried to use as little anchorpoints as possible to keep
    it fluent, but some characters, like the S, I couldn't make without some extra
    anchors.\r\nWhat do you mean with the 'weights are oddly place and the tops seem
    too heavy to me.'?\r\n\r\nThe spacing is a bit random and will totally be re-done
    once I start putting all the characters in Fontlab. It was 4 am when I started
    spacing it all in illustrator, so the motivation was a bit lacking as you might
    understand.\r\n\r\n"
