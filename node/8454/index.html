<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi, <br> <br>This is a corporate logo design I am doing for the "Progressive Dyers and Bleachers Association of West Bengal".The corporate group is an association of corporates from the hosiery industry involved in dying and bleaching of cotton cloth in the factories. <br> <br>I took the shape of the initials and used the form of "PDBA" to form the shape on the left which is there to represent the rollers in the dying machines. <br> <br>The problem is that, the client likes the logo but, he wants the letters to be readable in the same format. Also, I am not sure about horizontal lines at the bottom enclosing "Of West Bengal". <br> <br>I would appreciate any kind of help or feedback. <br> <br>Thank you <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/57090.jpg alt="pdba logo"></div>

<div class=commentbody>Ritesh, I like the concept of the rollers. The way the letters work is too good to pass up. The execution does need refinement(as you noted). <br> <br>First off, the overlapping forms should probably be more related to their forms, so: the ascender of the d should overlap the bowl of the p, which should overlap the bowl of the d. The ascender of the b should overlap the bowl of the d and the bowl of the a should overlap the line descending from the b. Some of this you've done already, but the lines that define the letters should probably stay more intact. Have you tried to remove any line portion that is not part of a letter? It might help a bit. <br> <br>The rules enclosing "of West Bengal" don't do anything for me either. <br> <br>Does the client want to change the condensed letters to large, open ones like the "pdba"? If so, it could get very long/confusing to read.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chris, thanks for the feedback. Here I made changes to the logo. Removed the horizontal rules(i think it goes better now), made changes to the overlapping, and in the 2nd one, removed the extra lines just to show u how it looks (I had tried that earlier but it doesn't really work because of the abrupt breaks). The client is quite happy with the letter forms because I had done another one with the similar font as the emblem but it was too stretched and also the thickness of the lines didn't match. <br> <br>I still don't think the letterforms in the emblem are readable. That is the only thing the client wants to be changed. <br> <br>Would appreciate any feedback. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/57145.jpg alt="pdba 2"></div>

<div class=commentbody>Ritesh, it would be nice if the lower case a in association was the same as the roller. Like an Avant Guarde lowercase a. I don't know if that face has an alternate glyph</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ritesh, did you explore taking pdba in a horizontal format? It might read easier. Also look at staggering pdba baseline, like the p could be higher than the base line of the d etc. Just some playful ideas. I like the colors.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The rollers and belts in the dying machines don't actually overlap, do they? I would think that they'd butt up against each other, that is, if they even touch. If this is correct, then it might help to solve some of the legibility issues with the acronym. It might even allow you to explore doing a monochromatic acronym. For example, you could create the belts in a screened back version of whatever color you choose to work with, then have full opacity where the letterforms are. This would eliminate the abrupt breaks. <br> <br>The typeface doesn't seem appropriate. There is no relationship between it and the letterforms of the acronym. I'm not suggesting that you jump to Avant Garde, but there should be something that ties them together and I'm just not seeing it yet. <br> <br>As others have said, your concept is great. Looking further into this identity, some photographic imagery (screened or not) of a dying machine (maybe focusing in on the rollers) might be a nice supporting element. <br> <br>Aloha! <br>Scott</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey fellas, <br>Thanks for the feedbak. I had a talk to the client and the client liked the concept and the logos and having given the below 2 choices he picked the 2nd one. <br> <br>Christos, I posted this logo after those initial developing stages of B/W. When the client approved the idea and the design, then he gave me the green light for putting in the colours. I have done a lot more work on it than you are seeing here and no Christos you were not being too naggy, in fact I appreciate your feedback. <br> <br>Daniel, I did explore the horizontal line up of the PDBA, trust me its harder than it seems. Thanks for your comments though. <br> <br>Scott, the idea was to take the basic structural shape of the rollers and use it in the emblem and not to mimic the exact form of the rollers. Also, I had to integrate the form of the letters "pdba" into the logo. At first the client was being fussy about legibility of the letters but now he seems to be alright with it.Thanks for the comments Scott.. appreciate it! <br> <br> <br>Guys I still think that the logo here on the right side is giving away too much blank space in the last 2 lines of the title "Of West Bengal", I tried fixing the kerning and all but some how I end up liking the way it is right now better than the other ones that i try out. Any ideas how to fix that part ? <br> <br>Thank u all <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/57171.jpg alt=pdba3></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think a logo that echos toxic fumes would be more apporpriate. (I kid!) <br> <br>To be serious, the concept is nice. The excution, as other's have stated, seems to need some work. <br> <br>I'd suggest pushing the stems of the letters to the outside edge of the 'rollers' so they become more easily recognizable ad individual letter forms. <br> <br>As for the type...you need more white space. It's way too heavy at the moment, which, combined with the amount of text, make it rather laborious to read through at a glance. Perhaps use a smaller face (smallcaps?) with more leading between the lines and perhaps a bit of letterspacing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Ritesh <br> <br>I think the usage of caps or small caps <br>would solve two problems; first, you have no <br>descenders and ascenders to mess as you go <br>for tight lining, and second you can have <br>better legibility in smaller sizes. <br> <br>From your last two versions undoubtly <br>I prefer the right one. It looks much <br>better constructed with "of west bengal" <br>next to the sign. <br> <br>Have a good day, christos</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello Ritesh <br> <br>I like your concept. <br>I also think the right one's typography is more readable. <br> <br>A few suggestions: <br>Did you try changing the thickness of your different elements? <br> <br>Did you try to use a font more similar to your symbol glyphs in the structure you have on the left? (One line per glyph) With a nice small caps sans serif, I'm sure it would be interesting to see. <br> <br>Em</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Ritesh
I think your concept is brilliant, but the result
is less strong than it could.
First of all i believe a logo should first be
explored in B/W. Of course this is a personal
view, but i think by this way you start solving
problems that will come up later.
So, instead of overlapping the forms i would
trim them darely, but of course long before that
the letters become illegible.
Also i don't agree (both aestheticaly and "technicaly")
with such a tight composition.
Aesthetically I think it gives a messy and "unsafe"
feeling which hides the beauty of your concept;
i would loosen up the composition by letting
space between the elements and instead
of aligning everything let the sign to stand out.
"Technicaly" i believe it is hard to read
such a tight lettering...and about lettering,
why don't you use Avant Garde or something "round"
that would remind the letters that your sign
is supposed to be made of?
Was i too naggy? Din't mean to be...
so, this is my view and hope i was helpfull.
Have a nice and creative day, christos
