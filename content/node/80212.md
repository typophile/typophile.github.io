    a number of typefaces with varying degrees of similarity.\r\nBy the way, it\u2019s
    better to bump/update your old thread instead of posting a new one: http://typophile.com/node/78308"

    masthead. \r\n\r\nI'm keen on finding out the exact font rather than a similar
    font. \r\n\r\nI already know that it's kind of similar to: OCR-B, Din, and Conduit.
    \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd one person on this forum suggested I look at the PTF-Notes family
    from Primetype: Notes-Bold. This font indeed looks similar but it's not the exact
    one.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows, I'd be most grateful for a followup.\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks in advance!\r\n"

  body: "Bumping this thread for another attempt at nailing this font...\r\n\r\nSince
    my last post, I went on several font sites, including whatfontis... and narrowed
    it down to the following 3:\r\n\r\nUBIK   http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=ubik\r\nPTL
    NOTES   http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=ptl+notes&num=50\r\nINFORMATIC  http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fatchair/informatic/\r\n\r\nbut
    I fear that none of these is a 100% match.  To me it looks like a combination
    of all 3, which is of course unlikely. There's also the possibility that I've
    missed a style (such as Condensed etc). \r\n\r\nInput from anyone with sharper
    eyes much appreciated. \r\n"

  body: "You should consider the possibility that the wordmark was modified on the
    basis of an existing typeface (maybe to emulate the look of an older, pre-digital
    logo). Given that, I think you were on the right track with PTL Notes. When you
    start with the small caps&nbsp;(!) of the medium cut and scale the letters non-proportionally
    (mainly condensing them), you will see that you can make \u2018G\u2019, \u2018M\u2019,
    \u2018O\u2019, \u2018H\u2019, \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018E\u2019 match the sample
    perfectly. In \u2018R\u2019, they made the diagonal steeper; in \u2018A\u2019,
    they raised the crossbar; in \u2018P\u2019, they made the bowl smaller\u2014not
    necessarily wise decisions, by the way. That\u2019s as close as you\u2019re going
    to get, I think."
