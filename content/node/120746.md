  body: Just wanted to say "Great work". Both because these look fantastic, and that
    you took the time to make the unusual, little-used characters.

  body: Really impressive! Also, it never occurred to me to design supplement fonts
    but it's a brilliant idea. Is there a longer history to this principle? I've never
    seen supplement fonts like these before.

  body: "These alchemical/astrological and monetarian character sets are actually
    a part of Andron Mega. I extracted them and put them into extra fonts because
    sometimes they are needed for specialized editing work. For those who need such
    characters but do not want to purchase Andron Mega. A few years ago I did the
    same with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-corpus-publix/|Andron
    Publix]].\r\nI also consider to release even more character sets out of Andron
    Mega as seperate fonts, e.g. Runic."
