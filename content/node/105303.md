body: "Hello typographer and typo aficionados;\r\n\r\nIt been a while that I noticed
  that this urge of logotype epiphany is recurring in the global news and on other
  news. \"A new logotype was made for the X company\". \r\nWell, last month I went
  to a presentation of some startup companies:  a place where a logotype need a place
  to live. There, some designers shown their logotypes, presenting them as their beautiful
  children. Back, I am wondering: <em>That logotype is just a 'chosen by someone typeface'
  with a color and the name of the company</em>. \r\n\r\nWhy they call theirselves
  \"the creators of the logotype?\". \r\nYou, that make the typefaces that they use,
  are not that creator of it (on that kind of cases)? Or, because they buy the typeface,
  they are the owners of your creativity? I said that, because they neither bother
  to refer the name nor the creator of that typeface. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think
  of that?\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nThanks F\xE1bio Santos"

  body: "I\u2019ve never been very impressed with wordmarks that are straight off-the-shelf
    font gylphs, no matter how nicely kerned.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the company name
    plays second \uFB01ddle to an original symbol, then plain type is just \uFB01ne.\r\n\r\nWhen
    the logo is banal\u2014the recent GAP makeover with Helvetica and a square comes
    to mind\u2014again, I wonder.\r\n\r\nAs James says, despite the underwhelming
    design of a logo, it may nonetheless have been through a relevant design process
    and, as part of a corporate identity, be a good design solution and provide an
    effective identity for the company.\r\n\r\nConcerning creative authorship, as
    a type designer I\u2019m flattered whenever anybody uses one of my types\u2014providing
    they have paid for it\u2014so see no need to be acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThere are
    some foundries which stipulate in their EULAs that using one of their types as
    the creative whole of something such as a logo requires special licensing."

  body: "It would be helpful if you posted specific examples. \r\n\r\nA logo consisting
    of just the name in a commercial font may seem like a lazy solution (and in some
    cases it might be), but keep in mind that startups often have very tight budgets
    and the logo designer may just be someone on their staff or a low-budget freelancer.
    \r\n\r\nAlso it's likely that the designer presented a variety of logos, and the
    client chose the simple one.\r\n\r\nAs for mentioning the font name, designers
    are under no obligation to do so. When you buy a font you're free to use it as
    you wish (within the terms of the license)."

  body: It's not that simple. According to your arguments, Gustav Jaeger, creator
    of the typeface "Catull", must be considered the creator of the Google logo as
    well! Looking for and choosing a particular typeface for a company logo is a (design)
    process on its own. Someone, and not Gustav Jaeger, spent time, chose Catull and
    created the logo for Google.

  body: "Nice point @gazegen. One of the most chosen typefaces that I had noticed
    is Underware Lisa. It is impressive the amount of times that I already saw that
    typeface in just different colors. \r\n\r\nThis is a place where I find some answers
    for my random thoughts. As a Designer I do know how sometimes doing a logo might
    be. "
