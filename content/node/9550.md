body: hey, <BR>i&#39;m working on a mac in os x with fontlab 4.5.  <BR>when i cut
  and paste a character from illustratorcs the counterspace does not register. it
  just fills. is there a function that i have to turn off/on to make this not happen.
  or is this an illustratorcs issue? i&#39;ve tried changing the path direction and
  moving the points around like i would have to do when this would happen to me in
  fontographer, but it doesn&#39;t work the same way in fontlab. i can&#39;t figure
  it out. i&#39;ve tried saving the illustrator file differently, but this problem
  still happens. <BR> <BR>thanks for any help or ideas, you guys.
