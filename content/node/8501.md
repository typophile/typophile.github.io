  body: Are you talking about Multiple Master fonts?  This might be best done in FontLab.  It
    is not a simple task.  You have to draw all the masters with the vector tools
    and then make instances between the extremes.  There is quite a bit of correcting.  Rounding
    errors compound quickly.  You have to be very careful to make the basic masters
    unless you want to take forever correcting the instances. <BR> <BR>You are not
    talking about using your Optima file to generate the family are you?  Not only
    would this be a very big undertaking of work but very against copyright laws.
