    could be based on a very badly abused sqooshed version of Garamond or Garamont.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CG_Garamond_6238.png]\r\nI
    took a screen grab of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/at-garamond/\"
    target=\"new\">CG Garamond</a> and sqooshed it, blurred it and reversed it.\r\nI
    feel so ashamed."
