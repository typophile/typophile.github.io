body: "Hi Folks, \r\nAnyone recognize this rather strange serif font, with a really
  bizarre g?  The book was published in 1978. The typeface also has an italic, shown
  on the back cover text. I have only scanned the front cover, because I would think
  these are sufficiently weird, that if you had seen it you would know it. Notice
  the 'fang serifs' on the c and e, and the baseline serif on the odd t.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help. I want to add this to the Serif Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cacciato001_4491.gif]"

  body: "Fivos, thanks. I have written to Carlos Segura of T-26 to see what he can
    tell me about this font. Luc's information is generally accurate and thorough,
    so I believe that it was a T-26 font. I have T-26 catalogs from years ago, and
    have some that bracket the font number (T0488) that Luc listed, but I could not
    find the one showing \"Indispose\". It is certainly the sort of non-mainstream
    design that T-26 is known for.\r\n\r\nHrant, I am curious why you categorized
    this as a 'swipe-n-hack' job. It seems like an original, if not attractive, font
    design. I suspect it may have been removed because the designer left T-26.\r\n\r\n-

    that it came in 3 weights, with SC, ligatures and italics for all weights, but
    he may have decided in view of later work, that it was not the quality he wanted
    to represent his work. He is the same designer who did FF Atma Serif three years
    later, and it has some similar features to Indispose. I have written to the designer,
    but have not heard from him yet, or from Carlos Segura of T-26.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Just to close this out, although I am probably the only one who still cares,
    I heard back yesterday night from Alan Dague-Greene, the font designer. He said
    it is \"not commercially available anywhere, and really shouldn't be.\" He said
    he didn't know why T-26 withdrew it from their collection, but he didn't mind
    that they did.\r\n\r\nWhen I told him I wanted to include it in the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]] he said \"If you want to list it, I can't stop you, but boy is
    it awful.\"\r\n\r\nSo it seems Hrant's speculation was right.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
