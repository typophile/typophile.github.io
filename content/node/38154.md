    my 5-yr old could use at home.\r\n\r\nAfter starting this, I got to thinking how
    much I love the way Europeans write their letters and numbers. Is that because
    their instructional sheets looked that way when they were first learning how to
    write? I'm very curious to see an example of their handwriting lesson sheets if
    that is the case."

    is what they're using this year at another school. So it appears to be at least
    gaining momentum here in the US.

  body: "I remember when I was in high school, we had a couple of exchange students
    from Germany, Spain and one from Argentina. All of them had the most fantastic
    handwriting. I also seem to recall that even though they came from 3 separate
    countries/cultures and two different continents, they were virtually the same.
    I theorized that penmanship was stressed more heavily outside of the US.\r\n\r\nI'm
    going to do my best to replicate the number 1 and maybe someone can provide a
    practice sheet of a matching style? (my apologies for the poor attempt) The reason
    I ask, I just believe it has far more character and flair to it. Guess it's the
    designer side of me coming out and trying to influence my son's handwriting style.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/number

  body: "Yeah, the figure 1 often has a hook \u2013\_but not in North America nor
    the UK, where it is a simple stroke. I heard of a German exchange student who
    had to argue with her American math teacher: He read a 7 where the student had
    written a 1 \u2013 \u2018European style\u2019.\r\nThen, we use a crossbar to separate
    a handwritten 7 from a 1. This habit seems to be so strange to Americans that
    they name this figure a \u2018French Seven\u2019, I was told. Have you heard this
    expressin, too?"

    mentioned, the three exchange students that were in my high school had what I
    thought to be identical handwriting. That was almost 20 yrs ago. . .ugh. ;) Thank
    you for the links.\r\n\r\nRecently, I have been noticing handwritten notes from
    our vendors/factories in China to have a similar style of writing as well. Which
    is odd, considering the English colonized Hong Kong, yet the handwriting I see
    is more akin to the continental countries of Europe. This whole subject fascinates
    me for some reason.\r\n\r\nMr. Coles/Mili/Aluminum: Thank you very much for the

    in England perhaps 40 years ago. I'm not sure handwriting is still taught in Britain,
    as 25% of school leavers can neither read nor write, let alone write beautifully.
    The general standard here is abysmal.\r\n\r\nThe countries of Continental Europe
    teach handwriting, English language and grammar better than schools here in Britain.
    I heard a recent report on the radio that British teenagers have a vocabulary
    range (in English) of about 250 words. \r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
