  body: Looks a lot like Perpetua, Im not 100% sure, though. The lowercase g is off

  body: "I think I agree with Josev, that this is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/perpetua/|Perpetua]].
    The J is quite distinctive and the numerals seem to match, especially the 5 and
    6, which I think are distinctive too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
