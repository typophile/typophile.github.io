  latin cemetery, with tombs from french citizen, italian, polish, armenian... Really
  old tombs. I was scouting around this afternoon when I came across a graveyard from
  1800, on which the carved lettering looked really really out of date - I mean, much
  more modern.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\ndr"

    in other parts of the world, but there\u2019s nothing that off about this highly
    regularized style popping up in Istanbul. Was this the only stone carved in this
    style, or were there others?"

    a sign explains that they took a whole cemetery away from another part of the
    city around 1870 and they put all the bones in this building, whiwh they built
    using the stones from the graveyards... It's a truely both creepy and fascinating
    frankenstein architecture. Here are some pics of the thing, the letterforms are
    sometimes amazing, especially when put altogether like this, side by side.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "Wow, David.\r\n\r\nWeird - and kind of wonderful.\r\n\r\nThey do something
    like that around here (Toronto), when old graves are moved or reclaimed they'll
    take the headstones and mount them on a new monument. But no quite like that.
    Of course around here, 1800's is old. I'll post some images in a day or so.\r\n\r\nThe
    sans is quite interesting. I often wonder how much type or lettering styles are
    influenced by the medium (stone carving is, after all, different from calligraphy
    with a broad nibbed pen.. ) or contemporaneous fashions and styles. And, I'm guessing
    in the case of a European cemetery in Turkey, the cultural background, training
    and influences of the stone carver has something to do with it.\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: "Yes, it is indeed creepy and fantastic. I've seen before old cemeteries being
    moved away in a crypt, but this is a first for me. About the letterings, it's
    very interesting for me to see some letters which remind me a lot of Bodoni's
    style on graveyards that were carved very far away from italy, and of course this
    very modern sans...\r\n\r\ndr"
