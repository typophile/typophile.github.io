  an answer to the following problem:\r\nI can not see any of the 1100 ligatures of
  an OpenType font in MS Word 2010 (PC).\r\nHas it to do with the OS or with the otf
  font itself? I think there wasn't such a problem in the previous version.\r\nKonstantinos

    be in ''publisher'' mode, (or something). If you use the ''help'' and enter ''ligatures''
    it will tell you what to do. Nothing is ever straight forward in MS Word. '

    and press Ctrl+D.\r\nIf that works, consider changing the font setting of the
    \"Body Text\" style in the same way."

    other programs  like InD, QxP, Illu, and some earlier MSWord version. But not
    in MSW 2010. Any other idea?\r\nKonstantinos Siskakis"

      need to know a bit about working in a terminal, though.

  body: As I read the TypeDrawer thread, the digital signature is only required for
    OS/TTF fonts (in MS Word 2010). The OP could make up his fonts as a CFF  font,
    and if the ligatures now work, it is a digital signature issue. If they still
    don't work, it is something else...
