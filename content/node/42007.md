body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm a graphic designer and I am working on an identity for my company.
  I just started with my logo and I would be very happy if you good give some feed
  back.\r\n\r\nThe  name of the company is Westvierzes. That means West For Six /
  Westforsix. That is a combination of the name of the street and my house number.
  So Westvierzes is nothing more than a geographical point on the map from were I
  work. A starting point from were I develop communication solutions.  My clients
  are mainly communal /governmental, television and diverse. \r\n\r\nI want to be
  my logo:\r\nclear, friendy and a good mix between trendy and timeless (don't know
  if this is the right word in english, but I mean the opposite of trendy)\r\n\r\nThe
  first designes are in black. In a later stadium I am going to choose colors.\r\nIn
  option A I combine the 4 and the 6 into one shape. To my it looks like a road  and
  that I like.\r\nOption B and C are two variations with an arrow. In option C it
  works as a flag.\r\n\r\nMy favourite is B because of the simplicity.\r\n\r\nPlease
  give your reaction. Thanks."

    Will the \"road\" from A work with C's type?\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\n"

    of Zelda fame.\r\n\r\nAs for the logo, my initial thoughts are in line with microspective's
    comment. I like the mark on A and the type on C. Just A is too modern, but mixing
    the two might have a good balance."

    just slick type treatments. You have a good story behind your business name, why
    aren\u2019t you using that as the basis of the logo?"

  body: "Nice style. Maybe too stylish to be \"timeless.\" I feel like I might get
    tired of those fonts in a year or two. The type in option C seems to be the most
    versatile.\r\n\r\nIn option A I like the 4 and 6, but I didn't read it like that.
    It has potential to be a very attractive logo. I would continue to explore that
    logo but I would find another typeface.\r\n\r\nIn option B (sorry this is a bit
    scattered, just thinking and writing), I think the dynamic of the offset type
    is very interesting. \r\n\r\nOverall nice work. Good dynamic in the composition."

  body: "Hi again,\r\nI decided to concentrate on option A. Like I said before it's
    a 4 and 6 combined into one shape. Maybe you can not read it like that but to
    me it looks attractive. And to me it also looks like a microscopic part of a road
    map. And I like that idea. I did some research on the 46-sign. Later I want to
    look to type and color.\r\n\r\nPlease give your reaction. Thanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/W46_5926.jpg]"

  body: "I think your last one is probably your strongest one (one with just part
    of the '46' orange). Looks pretty strong to me. I think the way the inner line
    curves out at the top of the 4 could use some minor tweaking. I think it should
    follow the curve just right of it a little more.\r\n\r\nOn second thought those
    inner lines may get lost at smaller sizes. maybe make them a little thicker."

    something awesome. \r\n\r\nI do not like the orange and grey combo - seems the
    opposite of timeless.  But color really isn't as important as developing the shapes,
    IMO... color swaps are easy.  :)"

  body: "@tylor.reimer: I did some tweaking. Better?\r\n\r\n@eeblet: You are right
    about the color. I did ad color in this stadium because the logo sign looked a
    little harsh in black and I wanted to have an impression how it works in color.
    I go back to black.\r\n\r\n@Scalfin: I made some variations, but somehow it is
    less dynamic. I don't know it's an improvement. Is it important that you can read
    46? I prefer A3 or D12.\r\n\r\nThanks so far for your reactions. Helps a lot.
    Hope you keep responding.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/W64-5_5699.jpg]"

  body: "Ok\xE9 the type. I started with the idea of using Vista Alt. Because I really
    like the W in it. But I have my doubts about the E and S. Three E's and two S's
    in the name, so they are important for the wordimage (?is that english?) I tried
    other fonts and came to three other options; Helvetica Neue, Frutiger and Interstate.
    I prefer Frutiger. Nice T, S and E but the W I find less than the Vista W.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is your opinion? Wich font fits best with the logo sign? (Like I said before I
    want it to be clear, friendy and a good mix between trendy and timeless) Do you
    have other suggestions? Really like to hear it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/W46typo1_4335.jpg]"

    is linked to looking like a street, but I think it could be stronger if it wasn't

    airline logo. The version I attached may look good as brush strokes.\r\n\r\nTom"
