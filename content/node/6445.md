  <BR>Everyone, <BR>Having a problem identifying the font this company uses for all
  their stationery. <BR>It looks in some ways like Albertus, but not exactly. <BR>Any
  ideas?'

    target="_blank">Fago Condensed</a>, which is close but the serifs and e are wrong.

  body: That&#39;s pretty close, especially as far as weight goes, but getting this
    one right on is important to the client. <BR>I&#39;ve tried Identifont and I&#39;ve
    tried WhatTheFont!?, and WTF came up with Scala &#40;which is close, but not 100%&#41;.
    <BR>So the search continues...
