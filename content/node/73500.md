  also apply for Landscape format?\r\n\r\nI did a sample but not quite sure about
  the result.\r\nhttp://www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=1CbablwmZCFgztUszeFGtVYBGfz41\r\n\r\n\r\ni
  would like to add that the grey area is not intended for text but rather images.
  \r\n\r\nThanks for any comments,\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nS"

    dependent on the type of binding you are using. Visually it should be even, methinks. '

    more modern approach uneven margins might work.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the original

  body: "@uzapucax that goes back to the concept of the page being bound in a book
    so it has a corresponding facing page. In that case, it'd make perfect sense to
    go with the inner/outer margins being different (because then the outermost left
    and right margins end up being the same).\r\n\r\nThat kind of format will look
    odd as a lone page, though. \r\n\r\n"

  body: you are right on that, is intended to be a facing page. Nevertheless i thought
    it could work as an asymmetrical more modern approach uneven margins, but it doesn't.

  body: "When discussing this you have to think in terms of traditional book production.
    A signature could consist out of 16 or even 32 pages that originated in one sheet
    of paper. The only constant is the inner-margin (excluding the effect of thickness
    of paper), and the outer margins could vary \u2014 not with extreme measures,
    but nonetheless a significant amount \u2014 on account of the trimming of the
    book-block. \r\nSo it made sense to use outer margins that were larger than the
    inner margins. And as in every industry \u2014 necessity will be rationalized
    and \u2018rules\u2019 will be established\u2026\r\nThe one and true way to establish
    margins is what is called \u2018trial and error\u2019: make proofs, look at the,
    change things, try again etc, etc.\r\n\r\nBTW in the war of margins there are
    dozens of established principles, be they based on the sequence of Fibonacci,
    the golden whatever or \u2026 In the end the eye has it: what looks right is right
