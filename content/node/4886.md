  body: '&#34;Antique&#34; faces similar to  <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/zinc-italian-sg/"

    target="_blank">De Vinne</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/egyptian-710/"
    target="_blank">Egyptian</a>. Faces like Egyptian would often be used as a boldface
    for De Vinne or Bruce Old Style. Ronaldson was also popular. Unfortunately, the
    closest thing available to it today is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-tiffany/"
    target="_blank">Tiffany</a>, which doesn&#39;t really have the same antique feel
    &#40;unless you&#39;re talking about 1970s antiques :-&#41;. Faces like the original
    &#40;non-ITC&#41; <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bookman/" target="_blank">Bookman</a>
    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-cushing/" target="_blank">Cushing</a>

    the type choices, but how you set them. I would recommend getting hold of or at

  body: Very interesting. When I started this thread I was thinking of the fact that
    the client really likes Palatino, and that my art director is a Garamond no. 3
    type of guy. Since that&#39;s where my head was at your suggestions initially
    came as a surprise. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I understand the reasoning behind
    your suggestions. I&#39;m just wondering if I should be considering using an old
    style font for most of the text, with &#34;period&#34; fonts for initial caps,
    heads, subheads, etc. Is this a &#34;cop out&#34;? I&#39;m interested in your
    reactions. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m anxious to get my hands on copies of the images, to
    become more familiar with the look of the material &#40;seen briefly in a meeting
    yesterday&#41;. And I agree, Mark, that it would be a good idea to do some research
    into the books of the period. Thanks.

  body: Palatino is from about 1950 and was inspired by Renaissance calligraphy. It&#39;s
    definitely not a look I would ever associate with the late nineteenth century.
    Similarly, Garamond&#39;s fonts were made in the 1600s and were not revived until
    the 1920s. <BR> <BR>The late nineteenth century was big on &#34;antiques,&#34;
    which evolved from Caslon&#39;s types, and moderns, such as De Vinne. &#40;Caslon&#39;s
    original faces, which were from the 18th century, were not popular again until
    they were revived the early 20th century.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Old style, in the sense
    usually meant today, meaning things like Bembo, Jenson, Garamond, Caslon, etc.,
    is a very 20th-century thing. Even a lot of the moderns, like Bodoni and Dido,
    and transitionals, like Baskerville and Bulmer, were out of style by the late
    19th century and didn&#39;t make a comeback until the 1920s. Most of the faces
    we call &#34;old style&#34; now were considered obsolete in the late 1800s. <BR>
    <BR>If you look at books and other things published back then you will see what
    I mean.

    comments in the Gomez thread. He referred to a thread on Typographic that had
    a link to Zinc, but I had to use copy and paste to follow it so it was on the
    clip board when I posted to this thread. I&#39;d better stop before this turns
    into Typophile CSI. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know much about it, but it is an authentic

  body: And of course designs from the late 1800s did not necessarily use fonts specifically
    created in that era. My impression of VIctorian design is really of mixing disparate
    fonts and dingbats. There were a lot of frilly fonts used with intricate dingbats
    and also blockier fonts based on wood type. <BR> <BR>There have been plenty of
    fonts created in the 20th century which faithfully reproduced the look of &#34;bygone
    days&#34;. T-26 created the Toulouse Lautrec family in the late 90s to recreate
    art nouveau fonts.
