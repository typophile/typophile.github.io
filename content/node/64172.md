    and \"p\" are too heavy/wide, the \"s\"s are too thin, the \"e\"s too round, \"a\"
    and \"k\" have a too thick vertical stroke.\r\nGiven the subject, I think you
    could try a more monospaced kind of feeling."

    I'm used to using/seeing Monaco so you can explore those kind of typefaces.\r\n\r\nSo,
    did you custom letter that..because it looks rough? Along with what riccard said,
    the 'p' and 'a' have some funkyness going on with it, like little indentations.

  body: "It's great to see scratch work instead of tweaking - it's the best way to
    really grasp how letterforms work. I might advise working on this as a whole font
    (and submitting it to Typophile's critique forum) separate from this logo work;
    on the other hand you only need 7-8 glyphs to do this job, so maybe you can in
    fact do the logo first (and actually many fonts start life as a logo).\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure what you mean by \"having one stroke throughout\". You probably mean
    expanding letterform skeletons, but -although that's instinctive- it doesn't really
    work, as it looks like you're realizing since you're having to do major adjustments,
    especially in your \"a\" and \"k\". It's better -although decidedly more difficult-
    to think of letters as black-white shapes, where what you're actually determining
    is the edge/border of the black-white. In fact on the computer what we actually
    do is define the border anyway, but the \"skeleton\" persists with us stubbornly;
    we have to bury the thing!  :-)\r\n\r\nYour new version is better. First thing
    I'd do is not bother with the small curve and resultant tiny aperture at the bottom-rights
    of \"d\" and \"a\" and the top-left of \"p\"; try just making those flat. The
    other problem is the \"s\" - almost always a tricky letter; it's hard to tell
    at this small size, but I think the bottom curve might be the only problem. Lastly,
    I might make the bottom bowl of the \"a\" slightly shorter (lower the top of that
    bowl).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    benefit from this since its lower bowl is too squat.\r\n\r\nIn either one the
    \"k\" is out of character. I would try making one of the arms curved (maybe like

    you have more balance in the logo by doing that. I also guess it suits better

    luck puzzling :).

    I found the shears worked better with the symbol when they mimicked its 30\xB0/60\xB0
    angles. You are very right about how it is centred, mathematically for now - thanks
    for this.\r\n\r\nEos thanks for the feedback, I have attached a variant below

    way.\r\n\r\naltaira, interesting view point! When talking with the client we discussed
    this very issue and came to the conclusion that the idea of \u201Cloading\u201D
    is a positive and relevant association if perceived at all. The loading icon did
    not even factor into my initial concepts. It was originally inspired by the barcode
    and the speech bubble funnily enough.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/concept_3721.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for the comments, very interesting and definitely thought provoking.\r\n\r\nepsilicon,

    too cluttered.\r\n\r\nLooking at the PDF:\r\n- Your idea for the \"k\" is interesting,
    and I think it can work if you make the curve bigger; and you should curve in
    the top of the stem-arm join too.\r\n- The \"s\" can be rigid that like, but it's
    also pretty choppy in its curve transitions. It's a very difficult shape to get
    right, and it's not easy to verbalize how to possibly fix it. That said, you might
    be able to get away with leaving it mostly like this, but just improving the \"internal\"
    straight-to-curve transitions*: bottom-left of the top counter and top-right of
    the bottom counter.\r\n- Since the bar-circle has to go left, I would align the
    bottom-center bar with the space between the \"s\" and the \"p\".\r\n- Should
    the bars in the bar-circle be thicker?\r\n\r\n* Make the straight segment shorter
