  properties:\r\n\r\n1. sans or display.\r\n2. contemporary (not cheap looking)\r\n4.
  ink-saving.\r\n\r\nwe air brush a lot of ink that is expensive on large banners
  up to 100 meters in length using laser-cut patterns. i have found a good, but still
  not the best choice: Soho Gothic Medium. do you know a better typeface for this?"

  body: How does Soho Gothic Medium save ink? Just curious how that works. The first
    type styles that come to mind would be stencil types, or dot matrix types where
    the letters are not solid.

  body: Large banners would seem to need large type to be legible from a distance.
    So, it seems that ink-heavy faces would be the best choice from a design perspective.
    As mentioned, perhaps line screening or otherwise patterning the face would allow
    you to save a few bucks.

  body: "mmm, dot matrix may work in some cases. stencil typefaces can look odd to
    the customers. \r\n\r\nhow does Soho Gothic save ink: look at the upercase G of
    Soho Gothic it's minimalistic but still an easily recognizable G. another thing
    about Soho Gothic: it's an attractive, contemporary typeface, neither that bold
    like Helvetica Regular nor awkward like Arial.\r\n\r\nwe don't print backgrounds,
    only headlines and logos. the usable letter weight of Soho Gothic for our purpose
    is Medium or Regular. bold and black would take up too much surface. hairline
    is not display except if you're lucky. in rare cases we can use stencil and hairlines.
    \r\n\r\nthe banners are outdoor ads. it's about the effective surface that the
    letters occupy, the smaller the surface the less ink will be spent. we buy ink
    in gallons.\r\ni would like to take bold typefaces but the ink is simply expensive
    at large banner sizes.\r\n"

  body: "This is a peculiar question!  :-)\r\nIt sounds like you're not looking for
    huge savings, which makes this quest seem hopeful. Very light weights can't work
    for functional reasons, but here are some ideas:\r\n\r\n- Fonts with heavy trapping,
    like FB Amplitude or this:\r\nhttp://www.type.fi/SuomiTang.html\r\n\r\n- Fonts
    that are made of up interrupted patterns, like:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/cabaret/cabaret/\r\n(But
    contemporary.)\r\n\r\n- I think the best solution might simply be inline fonts:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=inline\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    and the less visual impact you have, so what's the real savings? \r\n\r\nIf you
    use outline fonts, or an interupted pattern, you'll have more cutting time to
    make the paterns, which is probly more expensive than the ink. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe
    just apply a lighter coat or thin the ink?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    a face that works well with ample letterspacing, such as DIN or Interstate, because
    it can be used smaller.\r\n\r\nAlso consider a good editor, for shorter words,
    and the use of understatement and \"white space\" to convey your message. \r\n"
