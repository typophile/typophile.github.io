  a Typographic Comic. It uses all type and no images ... it's different than most
  comic books but can still carry a narrative experience.\r\n\r\nI have started a
  kickstarter campaign to help support this kind of project. So far I haven't gotten
  much support, not sure if it's a project most people are into. I am reaching out
  to fellow type lovers to see if you can help. If you know anyone that might be interested
  please feel free to pass the kickstarter link on to them, also if you are on facebook
  or twitter any mention help would greatly.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1529426808/typographic-comics?ref=email\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I will be presenting at the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art on Thursday July 22nd,
  at 7pm in NYC. The presentation is titled Typographic Comics!\r\n\r\nWish me luck,
  I think I need it.\r\nJames\r\n\r\nps. I emailed Typophile to make sure it was ok
  to share this info, I didn't want to seem like I was spamming."

    tried to contact the likes of Comicraft/Active Images? They publish both fonts
    and comics.\r\n\r\nBy the way, maybe you should've shown some images."
