  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a font, more like a custom designed logo. <BR>I
    might be wrong tho. As for something similar... can you  <BR>spare <a href="http://www.orangeitalic.com/luxury/collect01.html"

  body: Hmm ... seems to have hints of a normalized uncial. The notch in the y, for
    instance, is similar to Libra. Although it is probably more likely that they took
    something with Optima&#39;s regularity, stretched it and then added the uncial
    details.

  body: This Polydor logo is an old one, way before digital fonts&#40;in fact the
    logo is from a good &#39;ol vinyl record&#41;. This is most likely custom drawn
    or if it is a typeface, its source is likely pre-digital.

  body: The logo itself is available as a on a dingbat font called Rainbow which has
    all the EMI logos on it. This is not much help I&#39;m afraid.

  body: Hi everyone, glad to see Typophile is back too.  <BR> <BR>Thanks, all, for
    the input. <BR> <BR>Tim, just looked through Rainbow in PopChar and can&#39;t
    find the polydor bug -- lots of other music logos, but no polydor. Is there a
    secret keyboard combo you know of? Or, any other dingbat fonts I should try? <BR>
    <BR>Matthew, Signa Ext-Bold is a great second choice. It&#39;s not $1,500, is
    it?  :-&#41;    <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Alyce

  body: There were at least 3 versions of Rainbow, each superceding the previous,
    I cannot recall which one it was and I no longer have it. However, I do remember
    using it from Rainbow for a job about seven years ago. <BR>Tim
