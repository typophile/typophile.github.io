  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We are about to invest in one or two new printers for our agency. A problem we have had with printers in the past is that type gets printed a bit too heavy, especially on color printers. We have specifically been looking to resolve this problem with no good results. We&rsquo;ve tested out Xerox, Canon and some others on the laser side of things and Epson ink jets. They all print type too thick. Has anyone had experience with this or a solution to this problem? The dealers all say that they have never had this problem before, although when we demonstrate it then they can also see it. Thanks!</div>

<p>Inkjets will always print type too dark; lasers, including color lasers, should work well.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Joshua. Well here is exactly our experience. We have had an old HP Color Laserjet 5500 for years now. We also have an HP Black and White LaserJet 2300. Type on printouts from the 5500 are typically too fat, so that a regular weight  looks like a demi weight for example. On the 2300 the type is more accurately reproduced thought not perfect. We assumed that this was something specific to the HP. So we are looking to buy a new color printer and have tried out a bunch with samples. The printers with the best general quality: Xerox and Canon, also give the worst results with type, making them fatter than they should be just like the HP does. Interestingly we tried out an Oki. This had a pretty poor quality in general but the type wasn&rsquo;t artificially fattened.</p>
<p>So then we thought we would get an Epson in addition to a color laser. So we checked some proofs we got from our printer. Again the type was fatter than it should be. We hadn&rsquo;t noticed it before since we were otherwise using them only to check color. So this is a big problem when you are trying to develop a CD for a company. I can&rsquo;t believe nobody else has this problem. I would think that it is universal.</p>
<p>By the way Mojo, ick bin ein Berliner. I&rsquo;m an American living in Berlin since forever, so I know that problem very well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I haven&rsquo;t necessarily used the brands or products you mention. The general approach to printers is to have a B&amp;W laser for type and a color inkjet for photos etc. I think your problem may be that you&rsquo;re looking at &ldquo;laserjets&rdquo; (a hybrid?) rather than straight lasers. I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly a laserjet is though, so maybe I&rsquo;m wrong. I use a Canon B&amp;W laser printer with very good results, as well as an older (Brother?) laser printer. By the way, you still haven&rsquo;t said what software you&rsquo;re printing from.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have a Canon multifunction inkjet printer (I think it&rsquo;s some kind of Pixma), and I&rsquo;ve recently made two discoveries that might be common knowledge to those in the know, but may be helpful for the self-taught like myself:</p>
<p>Working in InDesign, I&rsquo;d always chosen &ldquo;Document&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Proof,&rdquo; in the printing dialog, because in my mind &ldquo;proof,&rdquo; equated with &ldquo;draft,&rdquo; as in something lower quality than I wanted. My recent brilliant discovery is that what &ldquo;proof&rdquo; actually means is &ldquo;simulate printing press results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the printing dialog (in InDesign), in the Advanced menu, there is a checkbox for &ldquo;print as bitmap&rdquo; which seems to be on by default. Turning that off seems to improve the quality of the printed type quite a bit.</p>
<p>Those two changes, plus going into the printer&rsquo;s own print dialog to make sure it was set to plain paper/high quality, vastly improved the quality of my proofs. The color on the plain paper is still a little washed out, but proofing onto matte photo paper will pump up the colors closer to what you&rsquo;ll get with a laser printer (and inkjet can deal with some subtleties better than laser printers, I think).</p>
<p>When I was in college I had a $50 hp printer that I bought at target in desperation. I printed a picture of a large etching onto 4 pieces of matte photo paper and taped them together on the back to make a whole. I brought it in to class and showed it to my printmaking teacher who, at first glance, mistook it for an actual etching. Even when it was clearly not an etching, no one believed that it was made by an inkjet till I turned it over and showed them the tape. That same printer pumped out the ugliest jaggedy black text you could ever imagine. So, I don&rsquo;t know, printers and the layers and layers of software and drivers you have to slog through, remain pretty mysterious to me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Joshua, We print directly from Creative Suite but have also tried converting to PDF and printing from Acrobat. Doesn&rsquo;t seem to make a difference. The HP LaserJets are straight up laser printers. &ldquo;LaserJet&rdquo; is just their brand name. As I mentioned, we do end up testing type on our black and white laser machine. I was just hoping that there might be a better solution to this problem. We&rsquo;ve pretty much decided to get a new Epson 4900 with EFI rip and built in spectrophotometer (in addition to a new color laser printer). So maybe there is some adjustment that can be made on the Epson to get good results. If you are interested I can keep you posted on our results. With the high resolution and the many kinds of paper you can use, there ought to be something that will work. For the laser printer we will probably go for some kind of multifunction model. Unless someone posts here with the secret to printing great type with a color laser device. Actually I don&rsquo;t really care if it&rsquo;s a laser or an inkjet, just as long as it accurately reproduces the type weight.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone else for your suggestions. You have to understand that this is a very specific problem for when you are trying to make decisions about type weights. It makes it difficult if you are testing with devices that make the type artificially fat.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>True Postscript vs. Postscript emulation also makes a dfference. I have a true Postscript monochrome Xerox Phaser 4510, and two Postscript-emulating HP color laserjets. Text on the HP printers always comes out heavy. Text on the Xerox is accurate (by accurate, I mean it is a very close approximation of the text color once it has been offset printed on coated paper). For font proofing, I rely on the Xerox for accuracy, but I rely on the HPs to show me what office users are likely to see.</p>
<p>I used to have a Lexmark color printer — it was Postscript-emulating but still had very sharp text output. Unfortunately it also consumed toner <strong>way</strong> faster than the specifications predicted, so it had to go.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The cheaper Phaser printers are not true Postscript.</p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;re looking at color printers, Xerox sells both toner-based and solid-ink printers, which I&rsquo;d expect to print text differently.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll want to look at the same documents coming through different printers.</p>
<p>The one flaw on my Phaser 4510 is that while it comes out of sleep mode quickly to print, the output is pale. Once the machine prints a few pages and warms up, the toner coverage gets deeper. So if you&rsquo;re making test prints off a cold printer, make multiple copies.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well we went to the Xerox shop. They are called XFaktor and claim to be specialized in the design/advertising market. The guy was certainly really well informed and was aware of the problem. He showed us an amazing multifunction machine called the 550. It had really impressive color calibrating features. But it cost about 20,000 €. Then we looked at the new Phaser 7800. That was also decent and cost around 8,000 €. We also looked at the really cool ColorQube, which is their solid ink product. That is really a great technology though the print quality still isn&rsquo;t as good as the traditional toner-based machines.</p>
<p>But all of them printed type too heavy. It just seems to be a limitation of the technology. If you want to have good color reproduction, the type is going to look fat. We still haven&rsquo;t decided but I suspect we will end up with an okay A3 office workstation and buy an Epson 4900 for high end. The type will probably be too fat there too, but it seems to be the best solution for now.</p>
