body: Hi all, I'm new to the site and have to say I'm totally in love with it.  I've
  decided to produce a new identity package for myself as it's been about two years
  since I put together the current one, and it is no longer a fair demonstration of
  my skills.  The upper font is my own creation, and in branding myself I felt it
  was a good idea to start with something I've created and move on from there.  Critique
  away, tear it apart, just keep in mind, I'm a noob to font creation and typography.

    \"g\" was viewed by itself I don't think anyone would know it's a bulb, but teamed
    up with the company name I think it works.\r\n\r\nIt would be more consistent,
    though, if the blue \"g\" was the same orientation in both uses. And in the lower
    one the company name looks too small relative to the icon.\r\n"

  body: Keeping the orientation the same for the "g" was something I was actually
    looking into last night.  I passed around a printed version of the blue logo to
    some friends without the company name and asked them what they saw in it, their
    response every time was either a light bulb or a number nine.  I'll tweak it some
    more and see what I come up with.

    of them probably knew your company name was Brightbulb, so that may have influenced
    their recognition of it, but perhaps it's more recognizable than I first thought.
    In any event I think it works. \r\n\r\nAnd I like the fact that it's not a traditional-looking
    lightbulb, which I think has been overused as a symbol of creativity. Your approach
    is fresh."

  body: Thanks, that's pretty much exactly what I was going for.  I've heard before
    that because light bulbs are so outdated and overused I should completely change
    the name.  I considered doing just that, but it seemed like such challenge to
    come up with something new, I felt it was better to just work with what I had.
