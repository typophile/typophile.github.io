  questions being asked here as well. Also, I have only just started using ID, so
  apologies for ignorance in advance!\r\n\r\nI have placed a white Illustrator .eps
  logo file into ID CS1 in front of a dark red background, and the logo keeps appearing
  with a tint of the colour behind. It will just not appear white. I have also tried
  an .ai file, and even a rasterised Photoshop .eps with a clipping path, and the
  same thing happens. When I produce a PDF from the ID file it appears the same again.
  I just wondered if anyone could tell me anything that I am doing wrong that is obvious?
  I have gone through every menu I can think of re background, transparency, trapping,
  etc. I am at a loss!\r\n\r\nAny help gratefuly received!"

    with .ai in ID, it loves native files.\r\n\r\nSince you have tried so many formats
    already, it almost seems like the transparency has to be coming from ID. Make
    a new container box and re-place the file. You've probably already tried this
    but you never know\u2026\r\n\r\nYour container box is set to Normal blending mode
    in the transparency palette?\r\n\r\nThat's about all I can think of right now\u2026\r\n\r\nBest
    of Luck!\r\n\r\npeace"

    I hadn't thought of just doing it!). Simple.\r\n\r\nCheers for that. Great site
    by the way!"
