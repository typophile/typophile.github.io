body: This is an edited photograph of a print. The client requests an exact match.
  The closest I have found is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/wearetrippin/display/glyphs.html|Wearetrippin
  Display]], but the sample is heavier. Apparently they are matching an existing stencil.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RESVD-01_3555.jpg]

    (not [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas|Neue]]) but same issue with boldness.
    Edited?
