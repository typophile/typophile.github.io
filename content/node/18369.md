  moto ive been sticking to is either the idea of fitting into a certain box which
  is \"yourmind\", \r\nin other words, the ideia of working your body.\r\nThe other
  concept, the one used on both the 1st and the 2nd logo is the \"mold\" idea, stretching\r\nyour
  body applying movement to it in order to accomplish that same goal.\r\n\r\nThe Type
  has a light and condensed feel, and i think it fits ok into the fitness whole idea.\r\n\r\nAbout
  the color, i'm gonna apply some light blue on both the logo and the word Fit.\r\nAnyway,
  they'r still in gray scale.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n"

  body: "I think it would be fair to say that at this stage your VI is heading in
    a very 'corporate' direction. Is this something that you are seeking?\r\n\r\nYou
    have some spacing issues which could be better resolved. The graphic in the first
    two ideations is floating and unattached to the type - there is a lack of unity
    forming here. Perhaps the type would fit better if the first line 'fityourmind'
    almost slotted into the concave side of the graphic. The spacing of 'fit' compared
    to 'yourmind' is also somewhat uneasy due to its spacing. I would remove the space
    after the word 'fit'.\r\n\r\nThe first option has somewhat more dynamics and horizontal
    movement making it feel slightly more energetic for a fitness trainer. \r\n\r\nI
    don\u2019t feel that the third option is working particularly well. It feels very
    static, and spatially the 'colour' of the negative and positive is unresolved.\r\n\r\nI
    hope this feedback has not been too negative and that my thoughts are of assistance.
    Good luck.\r\n\r\n-nic"

  body: "Hi -nic thanks for the feedback, yeah, the 3rd option i'm not even working
    much on. im rather goin to a composition similar to eiher the 1st or the 2nd.\r\n\r\nThe
    spacing can be fixed easily but I agree with you on the major problem here, the
    lack of unity bettwen the type and the graphic, and thats where i'd like some
    suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks once again."

  body: 'I''m not sure what the shape is supposed to convey-- even if you don''t want
    a real obvious metaphor (like a brain holding barbells! yeah, that''s it!), it
    should say something about fitness both mental and physical, right? I''m not seeing
    that yet. And I agree about the type not working together with the shape. For
    the words "fit" and "mind," e.g., you might pick up in subtle ways on the lines
    or curves of the shape thingie. '

  body: You need to review the concept of the name itself. It makes no sense, its
    like an inside joke. The shapes make no sense for a retail audience and the colors
    are dead. Try this, make Personal Training Solutions the main focus and make the
    name small like a subhead. That way the average consumer will know what the business
    is about and then the name. This would also allow you to make a mark that emphsises
    "personal"

  body: "i have no idea what the name or concept really means, but that probably doesn't
    matter. I assume this is meant to be a hip fitness centered targetted at the 20/30
    something professional crowd. If so, #1 seems to hit that vibe well.\r\n\r\n"
