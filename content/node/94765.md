  latin alphabet (abc...) was created thousands of years ago, and is optimized for
  writing, not reading. About time for an update, no? Dotsies is optimized for reading.
  The letters in each word smoosh together, so words look like shapes! Follow me on
  twitter for periodic tips on learning it (it's not that hard) or to tell me what
  you think.\""

    I felt it necessary to inform you that at least a few other people have tried
    this same basic approach out. So, don't get cocky. Been there, done that.\r\n\r\nOTOH,
    you may have come up with an approach that will surprise me. I wish I had time
    to be pleasantly surprised at this moment, but I don't. Maybe later."

    if you want to go that way.

    succeed. Unless you have a king, and those have sadly become few and far between.
    Maybe one fine day...\r\n\r\nThis is why my own alphabet reform effort (initiated
    in 1998) tries to push readability (which indeed cannot be fully achieved by sticking
    to handwriting) while requiring zero <em>conscious</em> effort on the part of
    the reader.\r\n\r\nBTW, somebody please inform him that the Latin alphabet isn't
    nearly that old.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Braille had exactly the same concept (whereas his motive was far away from
    Dotsies), but with six dots (bits). This also means that Braille has twice as
    much possible character definitions as Dotsies (including the space). As the Braille
    system spread around the world, the character set size restriction turned relevant.
    Unavoidably, new added letters had to be plotted in the same picture; e.g \xDF
    has the same coding as \xE8. Back at the 21-century, Dotsies can't represent upper-case
    letters, not even numerals, which is an enormous constraint. But then, Dotsies
    is (just) an experimental typeface.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that I don't seem
    to be able to discover a systematic idea in the character assignment. Why should
    be a,b,c,d,e the one-point-characters? Wouldn't it make more sense to assign those
    glyphs to the vocals (first I thought this was the reason for using five \"dot-cells\")?
    Or better, assign the simplest characters to the letters with most frequency (etaoin
    shrdlu).\r\n\r\nWhat I really like and have not seen before, is that in Dotsies'
    characters \"merge\" to form a word. There are no spaces between letters. Every
    word is a long ligature itself: a pictogram.\r\n \r\nGood legible? I'm not sure...
    There are no extenders, which are (speculatively) essential to form distinguishable
    boumas, and thus for a good legibility, if I may recall the ALL-CAPS problematic."

  body: My mom, for her master thesis, created a very basic alphabet consisting of
    dots and lines on different heights/pitch. It was used to transcribe the vocal
    utterings of a child without the physical capability of speech.

  body: "I don't see this as a beneficial proposal. Letters are made to be read by
    people; machines can read bar codes or punched paper tape.\r\n\r\nBut the Latin
    alphabet is more than 2,000 years old, although a few present-day letters of the
    English alphabet were missing, so they did get that part right."
