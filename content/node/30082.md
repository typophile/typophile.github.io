  film</a>, this one designed by Zurich-based designers Norm. The studio that printed
  it, Coeur Noir in Brooklyn (great guys... if you need letterpress in the NYC area)
  said they thought it was the largest character ever printed via letterpress. I chuckled,
  but then thought, maybe they're right? \r\n\r\nThat \"M\" is 1008pt. Have any of
  you ever seen a character larger that 1008pt printed via letterpress?\r\n\r\nHere's
  a pic, as proudly displayed by <cite>Helvetica</cite> project coordinator Christina

    body: Makes me wonder, too, if the paper and cut separated easily after impression
      ... that's a lot of surface area! (coax them apart with a putty knife?)

  body: The M was its own separate block, and they were printed on Crane's Lettra
    300gsm. The ink coverage is really even and nice. The paper ended up with a little
    bit of warp to it, which is natural for that big an impression.

    wood type block I've ever seen.  It's at the Hamilton Wood Type Museum up in Two
    Rivers, Wisconsin.  If you haven't been there, go.  It's awesome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/number2_6611.jpg]"

    printed letterpress. That's a darned large M in the photo, but I don't think it's
    very close to the biggest ever printed letterpress.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
