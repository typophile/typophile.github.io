body: "You all know a thing or two about airport security.\r\nEvery year I fly once
  or twice to the US and I have started to see a pattern.\r\n\r\nThe rigorous checks
  we all have to go through before boarding takes a lot of time and it is not always
  visible what they are for.\r\nAnyhow.\r\nComing from The Netherlands, I feel that
  once they see where we are from we will have to undergo a 'random security check'.
  I'm not sure anymore how random these are ...\r\n\r\nBut being cool about it (they
  are just doing their job), I feld I had to give this a podium in a t-shirt.\r\n\r\nFeel
  free to share your thoughts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thankyourforhavingus_5262.jpg]"
