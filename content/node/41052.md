  beautifully. Thank you. I only wish it was yesterday as I spent ali day exporting
  to word and back. \r\nProblem is that the endnotes with the script and my manual
  methond start from N0.1 which means I have to have the document as one file when
  I really would prefer to have it more managable as smaller files within a book.
  Footnotes work because you can start each file with any number but the script converted
  this back to start No.1.\r\nHas anyone solved this?\r\nMuch appreciative\r\nChuck"

  body: Hi Charles, I wrote that script. Please contact me off-line if it's not working
    as expected, or if you have any suggestions for improvements, and I'll have a
    look at it. Thanks.

    I did find the script at the Adobe InDesign Exchange Community under InDesign
    Scripts. It is named Footnotes2Endnotes. Thanks, Miguel for making the effort
    and then making it available to the community.\r\n\r\n"
