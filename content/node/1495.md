  body: 'Well they kicked Euri out in the latest release because the Germans have
    no sense of fun. They didn&#39;t understand he was there from day one to promote
    the Euro. They thought it was a slander. Which is wrong. Idiots. They are probably
    the ones who wanted everyone to put the standard lousy drawing of the Brussel&#39;s
    Euro in every font. '
