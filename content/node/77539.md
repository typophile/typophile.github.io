  that it is common in the handwriting of people who've been educated in Europe but
  not so much in North America. \r\n\r\nI'm using it to add bulk to a tabular lining
  seven, but I don't recall seeing it in other fonts apart from scripts.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Your belief about handwriting training is correct; however, a bar on the seven
    won't prevent an American from recognizing what it is supposed to be. If it looks
    good, do it...

    I wasn't confused the first time I noticed it. I just wondered why it was there.
    My then fiance wondered why it wasn't on my sevens.\r\n\r\nThe reason I am using
    in my font is to help he seven take up more space in the tabular figures and kill
    a gap that would be there otherwise. \r\n\r\nThe font is a sans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think what Nick is referring to is that in scripts, especially from older
    samples from France and other European countries, the one was often given an exaggerated
    lead in stroke that could be confused as a seven. Beyond that I think it might
    have been picked up as a stylistic variant, but the connection between the 1 and
    7 in these script forms is likely the main reason for that crossbar. \r\n\r\nThis
    is also done with cap Z's, but I'm not exactly clear how that came about other
    than to add some visual weight and create less white space."

    enough that you can be absolutely sure when you see a Z on its own, with no L
    to compare it to.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples that I found on MyFonts, a few

    should have two angles. one back one forth\r\n-     3 should have 3 angles back
