  that are aimed towards \"creatives\". I did stumble onto this pretty far out promo
  video, PunchPunks (www.punchpunks.com), for PunchStock's new rights managed collection
  that is pretty cool. Free magnets even..whoo hoo!\r\n\r\nAnyway, anyone come across
  any other promo videos like this for ad agencies or design shops? Thinking about
  maybe experimenting with something along those lines with my own studio.\r\nThanks

  body: well, this one certainly worked. I've signed up and sit here waiting for my
    magnets. I bet I also did Punchpunks a favor by replying and thereby increasing
    the chance of this thread appearing under "Hottest". What's your billing adress,
    Punchstock?
