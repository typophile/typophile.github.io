  light of the vast experience of some of the folks here at Typophile, I was wondering
  if someone could share what glyphs are the tallest and what glyphs are the lowest
  (and the languages to which they belong) once you venture past, say, the Adobe Latin
  2 set or Windows 1252.\r\n\r\nAny advice on what glyphs to use for the uppre and
  lower outer limits?\r\n\r\nAll thoughts appreciated.\r\n\r\nrich"

  body: "I saw that question coming but didn't have a good answer so I just waited
    for someone to pose it.\r\nAnd there it is.\r\n\r\nLatin script extensions would
    definitely be included.  After all, if the glyph set was expanded to include glyphs
    from Adobe Latin 3, which is a kind of \"next step\" I suppose, then that's a
    good part of what we'd encounter, correct?\r\nHowever, then, from what I've seen,
    the next big step in enlarging a latin based font for other language communities
    is usually adding Cyrillic chars.  Do you agree?\r\nIf so, let's include Cyrillic.\r\nOn
    the flip side of the globe, let's NOT include Asian glyphs.\r\n(And as an aside
    - I know Hebrew well enough to know that it would fit in within the upper and
    lower limits of a font with an existing Latin 3 set. Would that also be the case
    with a similar language like Arabic?  Huge language community, Arabic. It would
    be nice to know it could be added without recalculating the verticals.)\r\n\r\n
    Still thinking out loud - where would Vietnamese with its stacked diacritics fit
    in to this question?\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking to avoid most of all, is this:\r\nAn
    encoding like Win 1252 for a particular font has glyphs which call for a relatively
    narrow range above and below the descender and the caps height. And so you set
    your vertical metrics based on that.\r\nA week later, you get a call to expand
    to Latin 3 and to cover Vietnamese while you're at it and who knows what other
    language and there go your original vertical metrics right out the window. \r\nBetter
    to calculate enough space to accommodate these additional glyphs should they be
    added.\r\nCharles Kettering famously said, \"A problem well-stated is a problem
    half-solved\" so here's my problem statement:\r\n\r\n** I'm looking for a formula
    for calculating vertical metrics sufficient to accommodate other glyph sets that
    are most likely to be added later to the font file and/or requested in the data
    stream - whether a part of the same font file or not - to be delivered to the
    web page along with the core glyphs. **\r\nThat's what I'm after.\r\n\r\n(Here's
    an actual real-life example of the problem: \r\n&emsp;&ensp;if somebody runs a
    font through the Font Squirrel Generator and asks for a small subset, the Generator
    will calculate the vertical metrics based on the glyphs in that subset. However,
    if you ask it for a larger subset, it's quite likely the font will come back with
    vertical metrics expanded because taller glyphs are a part of the larger subset.
    I've seen this happen and, needless to say, it can screw up the line-height consistency
    within a font family pretty nicely if you don't catch it. All of a sudden descenders
    start getting clipped which never happened before.\r\n&emsp;)\r\n\r\nNow, since
    it's you who's answered this phone when it rang and your knowledge is vast, you
    got a recommendation for me?\r\nAs YOU begin a font with the basic ASCII charset,
    do YOU have a formula that leaves enough room vertically for them long and tall
    glyphs coming down the road?\r\n\r\nEager to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\nrich\r\n"

  body: "This whole issue is why I've been campaigning for script- and language-specific
    vertical metrics in fonts for many years.\r\n\r\nVietnamese is the commonest case
    for stacked Latin diacritic marks. The Danish \u01FA is usually taller, but is
    <em>very</em> rare in actual use, being mostly limited to use in grammars, dictionaries,
    and discussions like this one. There's not a lot of use of subscript diacritics
    in Latin orthographies, and when they do occur they tend not to sit lower than
    the descenders. This is also true for Cyrillic and Greek.\r\n\r\nWhen you get
    beyond European scripts, however, you'll find a lot of use of descender space.
    To be properly proportioned, Arabic needs deeper descender space than Latin, plus
    extra if text is going to be vocalised. Many Indian and Southeast Asian scripts
    vertically stack conjuncts downward, and can require massive descender space.
    Here, for example, is Javanese, which is an extreme case.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/msjav_5290.png]\r\n\r\nTrouble
    is, if you start setting font metrics to anticipate non-Latin extensions, then
    your default linespacing is going to be too large for English and other European
    language text; whereas if you set metrics for European languages it will be disasterously
    too tight for many others. Script- and language-specific metrics settings are
    the only sensible way forward, but I've yet to get any software makers to commit
    to it."

  body: "Thank you.\r\n\r\nI get the picture now.\r\n\r\nLanguage specific vertical
    metrics do, indeed, seem sensible.  (I can also see why it's a tough sell.)\r\n\r\nThat
    said - Cascading Style Sheets gives web authors the ability to manipulate line-height.
    Further, the characters requiring the extra height can always be spun off into
    a separate font which can either be applied to sections that require it or as
    a 'fallback' font which the browser uses when it does not find the characters
    it needs in the font or fonts listed previously in the \"font stack\". \r\n\r\nAs
    remedies go, that seems to be the sum total of what can be done. (Although I'm
    wondering if browsers will override the CSS settings. A good question I should
    test out.)\r\n\r\nFor now, all my work is with Latin-based and/or European languages.
    \r\nAs a precaution, I'm just going to include a glyph with no Unicode point -
    maybe just a solid vertical bar or something, to mark the upper limit in cases
    where, for example, an ASCII subset of the font slices away anything taller than,
    say, a capital H. \r\nAnd see how it tests out and if it's worth the trouble.\r\nIt
    seems unnecessary to mark a lower boundary.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nrich"
