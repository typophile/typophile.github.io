  logo. i had \"ag book bq\" in mind but would rather use something a bit more different
  to that... any ideas wellcome! the purpose is to use the font for longer texts as
  in contracts and agreements so that legibility is quite important...\r\n\r\ncurious,
  lina"

  body: I think you can use any serif typeface that's generally considered good for
    text. Nothing in this vast class of fonts should clash with AG, even in this sticky
    list. ;)

    since it might obstruct my intention to make the whole work look a tad 60\xB4s
    architectural or so... but i might be on the wrong track anyway... is there something
    like a typical 60\xB4s constructed serif? mmmh?\r\n\r\n, lina\r\n"

  body: "In the sixties, they might have used News Gothic (or Trade Gothic) for text.
    Frequently, the face used for display may not have been readily available, so
    they would use something relatively similar for smaller sizes. (This suggestion
    is based on an actual example--the original cover the the book 2001 A Space Odyssey.)\r\n\r\nIf
    you want it to look \"'60s architectural\" I would stick with sans serifs."

    2001!!! :)\r\nmy concern was that i would not like fonts that are to similar with
    the aforementioned akzidenz, (that is ag book...) but yeah i might give tg a try!\r\n\r\n,

  body: They used to mix fonts in ways that would now be considered odd, mostly out
    of practical necessity. I forgot to mention that the largest type (the title)
    on that cover was Futura Bold. I think when there is a difference in scale you
    can get away with type combinations that would not work if they were the same
    size or close to the same size.

    I apporove of the combination, I just thought I would throw it in. '
