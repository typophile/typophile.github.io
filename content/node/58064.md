body: Hey guys- just wanted to get some feedback/suggestions on this logo. Its for
  a brand new mom and pop soap company.  They use high end ingredients so they are
  charging a premium price, and need a logo to reflect that.  Any thoughts?

  body: "It's okay. It works fine, and that's fine if fine works for you. It's not
    going to stand out on a shelf full of handcrafted soaps. Are you doing just the
    logo, or are you doing the packaging as well. If not, do you know what the soap
    looks like, and what the packaging looks like?\r\n\r\nHow about something that
    looks handcrafted?\r\n\r\nI think that there is huge potential for the logo."

    actually penning it out on paper first and bring that image into Illustrator to
    work with and perfect.  Go from there and see what happens.\r\n\r\n-AB"

  body: The highlight and shadow shapes are not geometrically correct. Is that intentional?

  body: "Seven\u2026 soap\u2026 who's your client, David Fincher? :-)\r\n\r\nI like
    the colors, they seem fittingly soapy. I agree with the others though that the
    \"handmade\" quality isn't really represented.\r\nIt might be interesting to consider
    what the soap itself looks like. For example, I had some handmade soap recently
    that's deliberately cut non-orthogonally and has extra ingredients that are kinda
    chunky and sticking out here and there, so that seemed/felt really handcrafted.
    If your soap looks like that too \u2013not perfectly \"smooth\"\u2013 that should
    possibly reflect in the packaging/logo as well. \r\n\r\nThe difficult part in
    this case would be to find a look that communicates \"handcrafted\", with all
    the irregularities that entails \u2013 but make the irregularities feel like a
    sign of quality, not amateurism.\r\n\r\nSo I'd try some handlettered ideas. Carefully
    crafted faux type could really rock."

  body: in addition, perhaps some careful shadowing/faux embossing on the 7 might
    help. letters are usually pressed into soap bars, maybe that can come across subtly
    in the logo

  body: maybe you sould try beginnig with one color logo. I agree with the hand touch,
    maybe a lightly stamp look. You should look for hand writting font, something
    stylish, look at myfont.com.
