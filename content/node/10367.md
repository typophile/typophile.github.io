  body: That&#39;s Stradivarius, designed by Imre Reiner, originally released  <BR>through
    Bauer in 1945. I&#39;m looking for a digitized version.

    something.

  body: Thanks Dav, that&#39;s a good addition to the Guide. I hadn&#39;t included
    Stradivarius, because I didn&#39;t know of a digital version until now.  <BR>
    <BR>Also wanted to mention Jason Walcott&#39;s version of a very similar typeface
    by Helmut Matheis, called &#39;Primadonna&#39;. It is called <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000037"
    target="_blank">&#39;Primrose&#39;</a> in the Jukebox version.
