body: "<a href=\"http://bellanova.ch/imm2.png\"> Link to Image File </a>\r\n\r\nI
  feel like it's an obvious one because it seems really familiar. but it's so small
  i can't really tell.\r\nWhat I think I can tell is:\r\nSans Serif\r\nthe \"o\" is
  more round than the \"b\" and \"e\" (they are flat on the left and right side) is
  that a thing?\r\nlowercase \"l\" is slightly higher than the \"i\".\r\nleft gap
  in the \"m\" is slightly shorter maybe...not sure\r\nnot sure if the points on the
  \"i\" are rectangles or circles but it seems like rectangles\r\nhope that helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
