    capital F):\r\nhttp://www.whatfontis.com/Enter-Sansman-Bold.font?text=LevFlx\r\n\r\nSo
    that means if you want a dead-on match, it has to be Serpentine:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/serpentine/"

  body: "Why is the ID on this labeled as Enter Sansman Bold, when it's not a match?
    \r\nSerpentine is closer. I thought we were making it a practice to not point
