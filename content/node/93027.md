  and simplistic, yet everything seems to be shifted just where it needs to be. The
  extra thick arm of the lowercase r. The lower right hand quadrant of the lowercase
  a.  Produced by Indentikal, out of London.  I was surprised when I checked out the
  rest of their fonts that they seem to be overall a novelty font maker.  I think
  they are really on to something here, so clean, smooth and modern, without really
  calling too much attention to itself.  I am very curious to find out how everyone
  else here sees it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/corsiande_6072.png]"

    than a decade ago</a>, and probably reached its saturation point in the Adobe
    Clean lowercase a, three years ago. We've had the whole neo-grotesk thing since
    then.\r\n\r\nWhat I find notable about Corisande is that its most distinctive
    feature, the Didone feature of the lowercase a, is completely out of keeping with
    the structure of every other feature of the design. It's a typeface entirely built
    around sharp connections of stems and bowls, except for this one instance in which
    the bowl flows out of the vertical."

    think John means the same thing, and I propose a better term: fauve-grot. Fauve

    the shape of |a| is still a distinctive feature! ;-) "

    lol.\r\n\r\nWhile Corisande my have been influenced by Dax, I think Corisande
    is a better font overall.  There are some things I don't like about it, such as
    the curve in the bottom middle of the M, but honestly I don't think there is any
    font that exists that I don't like something about.\r\n\r\nhrant, could you describe
    \"this stuff\" a little more?  What features describe \"this stuff?\""
