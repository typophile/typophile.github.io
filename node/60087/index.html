<li>Pay careful attention to leading.</li>
<li>Look at the lengths of the poems, and design your trim size and margins to avoid either excessively short pages or too many page breaks. When you do have a page break, put the break where it makes sense in the poem, not just where you run out of room.</li>
<li>You'll have a lot of paper showing, so choose a good quality paper, off-white rather than bright white.</li>
<li>Don't use running heads at all, and don't use folios (page numbers) unless the book is longer than 40-50 pages. Pages of poetry usually have a lot of white space, so running heads and folios are much more conspicuous--and distracting--than they are in books of prose. </li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let me add a few things to Mojo&rsquo;s very sensible comments.</p>
<p>PAGE SIZE is very often dictated by the publisher. Even publishers most sensitive to poetry will often tell designers what the page size is to be. Publishers have their own arcana on this matter, which they consult during séances. When the publisher tells the designer the page size it almost inevitably creates difficulties (OOOPS: I mean &ldquo;challenges and opportunities&rdquo;) for the designer and/or compositor.</p>
<p>PAPER is also often chosen by the production manager at the publishing house. If this book will be printed by a book printer, paper choice will be further limited by papers the printer keeps in stock. Few books of poetry will have sales enough to warrant a special order of paper. Mojo&rsquo;s right: natural or off-white is best.</p>
<p>FOLIOS need to be discreet in size and placement. Head to the library and look at a lot of poetry books and folio placement. This can be a tough nut to crack with poetry books, thanks to the white space Mojo mentions.</p>
<p>RUNNING HEADS cannot be automatically dismissed. A poetry anthology may require them. Even at times a book by a single author may require them. This may be more of an editorial call than a design call.</p>
<p>Designing poetry books can be a lot of fun. In my current job I miss doing poetry. At times designers get lucky and end up collaborating with editors and poets, engaging them in discussion and showing alternate examples of settings. It often reduces the profit margin on design &amp; composition even further than its already low state. But you may find some excellent writing and you may make a pal of a poet who gets a good design. I&rsquo;m eager to see what you come up with. Good luck; have fun.</p>

<p>Ha, ha. However, for those who might not see this as a quip, I want to point out that the publishers dictate page size based on press specifications. If you add even a quarter inch in dimension to a page, you make it too large to be printed economically on a certain press. The result is that the job has to be printed 8 pages at time instead of 16, effectively doubling most of the production costs.</p>
<p>It may seem like arcana if you don&rsquo;t know the procedure, but in fact it is simple math. And economics.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Don:</p>
<p>I was indeed attempting a quip. But there&rsquo;s a bit more to it than the purely math and economic aspects of paper size and press size. Why, for instance, do many publishers reckon the &ldquo;right&rdquo; size for a book of memoirs is to be 5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;? Why not 6&quot; x 9&quot;? Why must academic books be 6&quot; x 9&quot; instead of 5.5&quot; x 8.5?</p>
<p>Why cannot a book be an &ldquo;odd&rdquo; (say, tall, and slender) size if the economics are not negatively affected? Trying to get these notions changed for a book that may need a special treatment can be a tough nut to crack. I&rsquo;ve been exposed to these decisions for decades now, and I&rsquo;m often flabbergasted. Especially with poetry, some works call out for a different size, but publishers cannot be convinced. Often the discussions do take on the aspect of a séance.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that bookstore shelf size is also a factor in deciding the size of many books.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ll echo what Will said. Having also been involved in some of these &ldquo;calculations&rdquo; when I was Creative Director at Storey Publishing, I will say that there are a number of factors which make up the &ldquo;arcana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Production economics are an important factor. Those being met, then design considerations and suitability to the content may come into play. But market expectations and trade considerations will also play a key part. (Even down to what will fit on the shelves in a particular section of a bookstore, as Will pointed out; some sections will have taller or shorter or deeper or shallower shelf sections &ndash; think art books vs. fiction.)</p>
<p>You could theoretically have the exact same book (same title, same content, same production costs and price point) but markedly different proportions &ndash; say, one tall and slender, the other nearly squarish (remember, I did say &ldquo;theoretically&rdquo;) &ndash; and one will be deemed more sellable than the other.</p>
<p>As with any design destined for the marketplace, there is a delicate dance to be found between going with the flow and standing out from the crowd.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Paper can comprise half the cost of manufacturing a book, so publishers and printers are keen not to waste any. 6 by 9 inches is an economical size because most book papers are manufactured in a 25-by-38-inch size, which just fits 16 pages (four 6&rsquo;s out of 25 and four 9&rsquo;s out of 38, with just enough left over for folding and trimming). 
If you&rsquo;re printing a quarter-million copies of <em>Harry Potter and the Dingbats of Doom</em>, it makes an enormous difference whether your trim size is 6 or 6-1/2. 
But this ain&rsquo;t Harry Potter, it&rsquo;s poetry, and if the print run is more than 1000, I&rsquo;ll eat my Haberule.

<p>Poetry lives on the fringes of the publishing world, where you don&rsquo;t enjoy economies of scale, but you&rsquo;re not subject to the tyranny of scale, either. Random House can&rsquo;t afford to let a designer suggest a different trim size or kind of paper, but most poetry publishers are small, independent operations who are more likely to engage in a dialogue.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with bowerbird about the majority of poetry books being rather uninteresting in terms of typesetting.</p>
<p>To me, careful and individual placement of poems is the most important aspect; each poem must relate to the page as a whole. This fails miserably in the case of short poems clinging to the upper left corner of the text block. The most pleasing &ndash; but also the most functional &ndash; placements, which allow the poems to breathe, are (visually) centered on the horizontal and have maybe a generous vertical indent, too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen many books where the poems were set so that their last line was always at the bottom of the text block &ndash; what was changing was the vertical position of the first line. This doesn&rsquo;t always work, though, and sometimes too much jumping around can also become distracting. You have to figure it out accordingly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an example of a poetry book in Hochuli&rsquo;s Desining Books with the title on the verso and the poem on the recto.</p>
<p>Nothing fancy, no poetic cliches, but make sure that individual poems don&rsquo;t look like they were falling down or out of the page. Don&rsquo;t make them look ashamed of their existence, place them in a way that will underline their self-sustained aesthetic importance.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m a performance poet, who no longer even bothers
to output pieces to the page, but back when i did that,
and cared about what they looked like on paper, i&rsquo;d
adjust the <em>leading</em> of each piece so that top lines and
bottom lines always fell at page-top and page-bottom.
(my lines are always centered, if it helps you visualize it.)</p>
<p>it worked for me; i liked its sensibility.</p>
<p>so if the poet has interest or input on how s/he would
like the poems to look on the page, i&rsquo;d listen carefully&hellip;</p>
<p>as for graphics, a friend and i designed his chapbook
using maps as graphics on most of the pages, which
would be extremely simple today with google maps&hellip;</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m also constantly on the lookout for the poet who
wants to hand print her chapbook in her own writing,
because i sense that i&rsquo;m going to find her <em>eventually</em>.
(that&rsquo;s how i know it&rsquo;s a woman.)  however, if you should
find her first, do please go ahead and suggest it to her&hellip;
(she&rsquo;ll know immediately it&rsquo;s what she wants to do, and
she will thank you then and there, and later, repeatedly.)</p>

<p>Why must academic books be 6” x 9” instead of 5.5” x 8.5?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because publishers charge a fortune for them, since adopted texts are a captive audience, and the larger size is a rationale they can use for the higher fee. (Like a unit price of 4.27 for the smaller size, and a unit price of 4.59 for the larger price justified selling the book for $40 more).</p>
<p>Computer books in the 90s were other books that would sell at any price, and thus were overpriced. They also tended to be a slightly larger format.</p>
<p>(I just got a book from the college bookstore yesterday for a course I am building. 1 inch thick (500+ pages) 9x12 hardcover format, and a price tag of $142.75 Canadian. Something tells me that the poetry book that this thread is about will cost closer to 10% of that.)</p>

<p>i&rsquo;d use 10-point, or even 11-point, (or 10.7-point),
and still feel 12-point leading gives enough spacing.</p>
<p>i also feel comfortable changing the leading of pieces.
so i&rsquo;d go with a generous leading for most of the book,
and tighten it up only on the few pieces when needed.
(oftentimes i&rsquo;ll make sure the leading matches for the
two pieces that compose a facing-pages spread, but
i don&rsquo;t think readers notice a change between pages.
and even if they do, what difference does it make?
i&rsquo;ve known poets who set every poem in its own font,
specifically chosen for it, and i liked that just fine, so
i see no problem with doing intelligent copy-fitting.)</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d also size the titles down, and count on bolding and
their separation/appearance to make their role clear&hellip;
that would give you a touch more room, when needed.</p>
<p>i also didn&rsquo;t care for the horizontally-placed poems&hellip;
but maybe that&rsquo;s just me, which brings up the disclaim:
this feedback is given solely because you asked for it.
you&rsquo;re the one doing the job; the decisions are yours.</p>

<p>I had meant to post some comments when you posted the first sample on the 23rd, but I got too busy. So I&rsquo;ll give them here anyway.</p>
<p>I really like the titles at the bottom, and the varying line lengths of the poems moving up. The undulation is very nice. I think I would have gone with italic for the poem titles. For some contrast, and to keep the idea of &ldquo;flow&rdquo; going.</p>
<p>The folios bother me a bit. At the risk of getting too fussy, I might have looked at a light sans for them.</p>
<p>In the poems on pages 11 and 12, how about tracking out the all-cap lines a bit? And then you&rsquo;ll need to adjust some pairs, such as RA to get even latter spacing throughout those poems.</p>
<p>The horizontal poem looks fine. A nice jolt there.</p>
<p>Type size and lead are fine; don&rsquo;t mess with them, especially differential leading among poems. The note at the first poem looks very nice; italic is right for that element. &amp; don&rsquo;t worry about show-through. Unless you print the thing on cover paper you&rsquo;ll always have some show through. And for this book (if this is the whole extent of it) you will want a nice, flexible book.</p>
<p>As I say: I’m sorry to see you need to re-work this. We’ll be interested to see what you come up with.</p>

<p>Sadly this solution didn&rsquo;t go thru, I will try to do my best within given constraints.</p>
<p>Will I did some tracking, it&rsquo;s values are about 50 i think, without kerning or adjusting. Didn&rsquo;t want to go thru details at this stage.</p>
<p>Currently, author and his associate are trying to find sponsors for print so that they can print and put photos back in. Other side of this story is that visually, these photos are pretty bad, sometimes no motive or theme, just snapshots. What to do with these requests?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some people would hold their noses, do the job, and take the check to the bank. many wold make sure they were not listed in the credits for the project. Others would decline to be part of the project any further. Every circumstance is individual. I designed and composed a poetry book a while back. The publisher and author wanted things I did not like. I sent them the files, told them to do as they wished with them, and told them to keep my name out of the book. It was a pro bono job so I was not going to get any loot anyway. The files had been done, they were of no use to me.</p>

<p>Finally, we came to aggrement, no photos, no colors. I agreed on smaller format, now 14x23cm, with 10 pt poem text with side folios.</p>
<p>In the pdf are also centered folios.</p>
