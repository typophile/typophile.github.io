body: I&#39;m trying to find the serif font used in the European Business magazine.
  It&#39;s also used in their website at <a href="http://www.europeanbusiness.eu.com/"
  target="_blank">http://www.europeanbusiness.eu.com/</a> &#40;The serif font in the
  top menu and eB-titles.  <BR> <BR>It looks a lot like Swift and DTL Documenta, but
  it&#39;s not. <BR> <BR>Any help is preciated!

    <BR> <BR>Sorry! After a closer look, the font on the website is not the same as
    in the magazine. Here&#39;s the sample.

    for the E and the B, I don&#39;t know...   the B could be a little bolder though.

  body: Big thanks to Yves! Enigma that is, and I think I can fit it into my budget
    since the price covers the small caps and such. And it&#39;s OpenType also! <BR>
    <BR>I think I&#39;m excited now..
