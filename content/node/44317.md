  I'm working on for a \"Kids at Risk\" center, the text needs to look as if written
  by a confused troubled teenager, complex (not elegant) but still flowing, perhaps
  a hybrid of [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_mistral/?sample_text=I\u2019m%20just%20trying%20to%20escape%20for%20a%20few%20hours%20\u2013%20that\u2019s%20all.%20Don\u2019t%20judge%20me%20\u2013%20you%20don\u2019t%20know%20how%20messed%20up%20everything%20is.%20&sample_size=18|Mistral]]

  preferably in Opentype so that alternates would give it more authenticity. \r\n\r\nAlready
  tried posting [[http://www.typophile.com/node/44202|here]] but no luck so far, please
  help!\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    doodles and little skulls over the eyes and stuff.

  body: "Doing it by hand would be cool, except that my handwriting is complicated
    enough, but not <strong>that</strong> complicated...\r\n\r\nNick, a MyFonts search
    does not give me a 'professional opinion', that's what I really need.\r\n\r\nSo
    what's up with Opentype? \r\nI thought it has advanced to the point where you
    can actually utilize it on more than just ff or fi."

  body: "Hi Sam. Yes, OpenType makes many more ligatures and contextual alternates
    possible. How many ligs and alts are included depends on the font. \r\n\r\nI think
    Amadeo is your best option right now. There are quite a few OpenType scripts around,
    but none that are quite the right thing for the genre you seek."

  body: Nick's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/shinntype/handsome_pro_ot/">Handsome
    Pro</a> is one of the better OT handwriters, but it's probably far too clean 'n'
    even for this project.

  body: "Thanks Nick, Handsome is indeed great as handwritten but not so suitable
    for this project, while Amadeo would do the job it is lacking Opentype capabilities.\r\n\r\nAny
    idea what the font used in this Etsy [[http://www.etsy.com/storque/section/thisHandmadeLife/article/handmade-weddings-louchelabs-love-story/1304/|video

  body: Regardless of the format (OpenType or non) that Etsy font is missing the sort
    of alternate glyphs required to emulate true handwriting. The fact that it's a
    font is very obvious and that won't serve your purpose well.
