- body: Jeff isn&#39;t being pessimistic. When companies stop putting value into design,
    it hurts everyone who does. <BR>A good logo requires lots of research, time, care,
    and craft. <BR>The company may even perceive that they are getting a bargain.
    They recieve a variety of designs, and they get to pick which one. But a good
    designer can do in one try what it takes 100 amateurs to attempt &#40;but fail&#41;.
    Likely, instead of a logo that holds its value over time, the company has to redesign
    once again. Whatever they invested into applications of the first logo is usually
    lost. Consumers need time to familiarize themselves with a logo, and this time
    is also lost. <BR>David, there is plenty of conversation about speculative contests
    online. If you read up on it more, and not just Jeff&#39;s article, you will see
    that it isn&#39;t positive for anyone, not even for the person who &#34;wins&#34;.

  body: 'David - <BR> <BR>The only thing worse than a potential client who does not
    value the efforts of a professional graphic designer is a designer who doesn&#39;t
    appreciate the value of their own time and work.  While I enjoy designing logos,
    and get a great deal of personal satisfaction from my work, I&#39;m running a
    business and need to make a living.   <BR> <BR>If I want to do some good for a
    nonprofit organization in whose cause I strongly believe I will produce some pro
    bono work and then promote the hell out of it.  In many cases such organizations
    can&#39;t afford the services of a professional designer and will greatly appreciate
    what is done for them.  There is tremendous value in working with nonprofits in
    this manner.   <BR> <BR>The problem with the so-called &#34;contests&#34; for  for-profit
    ventures is that the &#34;client&#34; will not appreciate the value of one&#39;s
    work when they are basically getting it for free.  That is often what it is worth
    to them - nothing.  These for-profit business are simply trying to avoid paying
    market value for the work of designers - and getting a lot of speculative designs
    in the process.  They are basically taking advantage of naive designers. <BR>
    <BR>The value of my work is determined by 27 years of past experience, my talents
    and my skills.  Potential clients need to base their decision to hire me on my
    portfolio of past work.  They don&#39;t get to &#34;test drive&#34; me, by having
    me produce designs without a contract or deposit check,  to see if what I do may
    fit their needs. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a great piece about speculative presentations.  It
    ties into the the whole &#34;client trying to get something for nothing&#34; issue:

    will if you shotgun like that&#41;, they&#39;d order a handful of copies. <BR>
    <BR>They&#39;d then send these publications directly to the client with a note

    <BR>Many major private and public sector clients think it is good business practice
    to hold a design contest or require spec work as part of their search and selection
    process when recruiting the services of a graphic designer or design firm. In
    fact, requests for design contests or spec work: <BR> <BR>- are exploitative,
    as they demand design work for free and without guarantee of compensation, <BR>
    <BR>- offer no future potential, <BR> <BR>- can lead to copyright infringement,
    <BR> <BR>- devalue the profession of graphic design and lead to negative competitive
    practices, <BR> <BR>- threaten the integrity and work ethic of the graphic design
    profession, <BR> <BR>- are discouraged by allied professions such as the advertising
    industry. <BR> <BR> <BR>The 2010 Winter Olympics was awarded to Vancouver Canada.

    <BR>The prize was $25,000 Cdn.and two tickets to the opening ceremonies. <BR>The

    organization is the  <BR>educate everybody else about what a designer is, <BR>and
    the benefit of working with someone with a  <BR>full set of skills, not just Dreamweaver.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>This came after this text : <BR> <BR>. <BR> <BR>I never give them
    hell for having a competition, <BR>because it is done from ignorance. So I can

    get it. <BR> <BR> <BR>Regarding: Announcement of Graphic Design Competition <BR>
    <BR>Thank you for your fax regarding the competition. <BR> <BR>I must decline
    to participate. As a Professional <BR>Member of the Graphic Designers of Canada,
    I  <BR>subscribe to our Society&#39;s Code of Ethics, which <BR>prohibits members
    from undertaking speculative <BR>&#40;I design something; if you like mine, I
    get paid;  <BR>if you like someone else&#39;s better, I don&#39;t get  <BR>paid&#41;
    design. <BR> <BR>I have found that people and organizations  <BR>seeking quality
    design are sometimes not well- <BR>served by design competitions. A professional  <BR>designer&#39;s
    job includes research and the  <BR>establishment &#40;with the client&#41; of
    an effective  <BR>marketing plan which should be the driving force <BR>behind
    any design. The risk with requests for  <BR>speculative design can be that designs
    submitted <BR>might not be founded on sound marketing and long- <BR>term planning
    principles, and therefore not be a <BR>strong tool in the development of the  <BR>organization.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not trying to be contentious, but... If you  <BR>needed legal
    work done, would you ask a group of <BR>lawyers to submit work and the winner
    would get  <BR>paid? Or dental work? Or film-making or copy- <BR>writing? If not,
    why is it appropriate for  <BR>graphic design work? My guess is that it&#39;s  <BR>because
    you have seen contests like this  <BR>advertised before. But there are alternatives  <BR>that
    are respectful of both a client&#39;s finances  <BR>and a designer&#39;s work.
    <BR> <BR>I understand an organization&#39;s wish to achieve  <BR>goals in the
    most economical way. All of my  <BR>clients want their work done economically.
    If  <BR>you are ever in need of design again, there are  <BR>several ways that
    designers can be approached,  <BR>solid working relationships established, and  <BR>design
    goals reached, without the &#39;speculative  <BR>work request&#39; trap. I&#39;d
    be happy to discuss this <BR>with a representative of your organization,  <BR>should
    you want to know more. &#40;This is not a  <BR>self-serving offer: I am on the
    executive of the <BR>local chapter of the Graphic Designers of Canada, <BR>and
    part of what I do is supply the public with  <BR>information. When I do this,
    I remove myself  <BR>from consideration for professional benefit.&#41; <BR> <BR>I
    wish you well in your search for your new  <BR>identity. <BR>Sincerely, <BR> <BR>
