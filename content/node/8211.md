  about &#42;Experimental Typography&#42;.  <BR> <BR>I am aware that this is an overused
  term; I am looking for examples of experimentation in typography, which would be
  closer to the notion of experiment in the scientific context: experiment as a research
  method where an hypothesis is tested to either falsify or verify it. Experimental
  typography in this sense would be less concerned with the final result, but focused
  on the process of creation, upon which other projects can feed. <BR> <BR>I have
  to stress again the hypothesis, or an intention of the designer is an important
  aspect prior the process. Which means that I am less interested in formal exercises
  where the purpose is not defined. <BR> <BR>Can you guide me to interesting examples
  of experimentation in typography? Thank you for your advice. Peter'

  body: '&#34;Experimentation&#34; is indeed a problematic term. Some people use it
    to justify play while some others use it to dismiss any attempt at improving Latin.
    Anyway. <BR> <BR>Depending on where you draw the line, you might end up with a
    fair amount, or virtually nothing. I know you&#39;re not interested in things
    like NotCaslon &#40;hooliganism&#41;, but I assume you&#39;re also not interested
    in things like Tiresias &#40;leveraging empiricism to cement the satus quo&#41;.
    I guess asking this is a good litmus test: would you include Thompson&#39;s &#34;Alphabet
    26&#34;? It&#39;s based on a scietific intent, but an imaginary one. It might
    seem unwise to include it, but then you might be stuck with highly &#34;scientific&#34;
    efforts which -due to the historic inadequacy in typographic empiricism- will
    give you nothing. <BR> <BR>Another issue is whether you&#39;re focusing on a certain
    intent: improving readability, heightening a certain emotion, or what? Or are
    you interested in <i>any</i> intent. That would be ideal I think, but it would
    also make the article quite broad and long. <BR> <BR>Trying to guess at what you
    really need, I can think of these three instances: <BR> <BR> <BR>1&#41; A pretty
    old one, but from the catalyst of the understanding of readability himself: Javal.
    In his book of 1905 he shows two alphabets intended for reading small sizes: <BR><a

    <BR>This effort seems to have been picked up by Thomas Huot-Marchand &#40;see
    his article in Typografische Monatsbl'

  body: 'Thanks for the examples. Yes, i&#39;d love to see more. As a matter of fact
    i wasn&#39;t familiar with Javal and Thomas Huot-Marchand. Can you direct me to
    more information please? <BR> <BR>A lot that you mention is based on an idea of
    reformation, which basically works only in opposiiton to somethign else. Do you
    think that experimental design operates in this field? In other words: do you
    think that if you were the only typographer/type designer on an isolated island
    that than it would be impossible to make experimental typography? <BR> <BR>if
    you read my initial entry than you see that this is not what was i interested
    in, but since this is how experimentaion is widely understood, it is interesting
    to think about it.'

  body: 'Peter, your angle on the reform-centric nature of experimentation &#40;at
    least in the layman understanding of the term&#41; is interesting - I hadn&#39;t
    thought of it. It seems to make sense that you have to be going against something,
    something expected or assumed. On the other hand, I&#39;m not sure being on an
    island precludes it: as long as there&#39;s <i>some</i> context &#40;and there
    always is&#41;, there&#39;s something to &#34;reform&#34;. Even an individual
    is not one static thing, so experimentation is <i>always</i> a natural facet of
    learning. <BR> <BR>Javal/Huot-Marchand: <BR>I&#39;ll email you a PDF of an article
    about it - assuming you read French... You could also ask Lukas Hartmann &#40;the
    editor of TM&#41; for a copy of the actual article &#40;in issue #2/2004&#41;
    which I presume details everything - if you do get a copy please let me know.
    And if you want more/better scans from the Javal book just holler. <BR> <BR>My
    stuff: <BR>The best single place to read it is my 10K-word essay in the book &#34;Graphic
    Design &amp; Reading&#34;. Gunnar says he doesn&#39;t mind if I republish it elsewhere,
    but as long as the book &#40;which just happens to contain some great other material
    besides! :-&#41; is still selling, in fact as low as $2 used on bookfinder.com,
    I feel bad just throwing it out. There&#39;s also a quarter-length version of
    that essay in issue #54 of tipoGrafica magazine &#40;in the English original and
    a superb Spanish translation&#41; and that can be bought for around $10. But if
    you&#39;re really <i>that</i> strapped for cash here are the PDFs: <BR>&#40;136Kb&#41;

    <BR> <BR>&#42; Which also contains an interesting and revealing article by Smeijers.
