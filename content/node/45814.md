  body: Another instant classic from Ludwig. I look forward to using this alongside
    Marat, which has already found great favor with my clients. Mokka has a very different
    personality, as spiky and medieval as Gaudi. Its creative centerpiece is the lower
    case roman a, extraordinarily fresh and sculptural, with so much invention flowing
    from there. That little nose in profile at the top of the lower case roman i and
    others, the pushy little elbow on the lower case roman g, the aggressive tail
    at the bottom of the lower case italic f, the limp-wristed hello in the top corner
    of the lower case italic y and w. So many details to show off...it should always
    be used large. Keep in truckin', Ludwig!!
