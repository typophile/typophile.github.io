body: 'It seems that there will be a new substantial book about the great Jan Tschichold.
  "Jan Tschichold: Master Typographer: His Life, Work and Legacy", edited by Cees
  W. de Jong and with essays by Jorre Both, Stefanie Burger, Martijn F. Le Coultre,
  Richard Doubleday, and Alston W. Purvis, will be out in november this year, on Thames
  & Hudson. It''s nice to see this groving interest in the master''s life and work.
  Burke''s "Active Literature", which I read early this year, was great, and this
  new book looks like an interesting reading too.'

    Tschichold I have, <cite>Two titans: Mardersteig and Tschichold, a study in contrast</cite>.
    It\u2019s small and you can read it in about an hour."
