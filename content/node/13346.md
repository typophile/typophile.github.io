  of optical sizes for text usage but does anyone print paperbacks anymore?"

  body: "A cursory search via Google suggests that paperbacks published every year
    still number in the tens of millions. And paperback books aren't the only venue
    in which <strong>Paperback</strong>'s virtues would be appreciated: newspapers
    are still being published in hardcopy form, and newsprint isn't a particularly
    deluxe printing surface.\r\n\r\nOptical sizing certainly isn't a new concept.
    Oldtime punchcutters kept it in mind when they put together their (real) fonts.
    A lot of old type specimens that I have encountered are quite different at different
    point sizes."

    this area.\r\n\r\nMy main questions are:\r\n1) Does the 6-point master go far
    enough, optical-conpensation-wise?\r\n2) What \"benefit\" does the faceting have?
    Or is intended as a form of stylistic expression, perhaps a personal \"stamp\"
    (considering Downer's other designs, especially Vendetta and Simona).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I recently did a lot of design work for a mass-market paperback publisher.\r\nBut
    only book covers. And it's the same for most publishers.\r\nThey commit their
    creative budget to freelance design for the covers, and handle the interiors in-house,
    and these are not usually given the same degree of typographic attention.\r\nIf
    they want to nuance the body copy, they use Bembo or Perpetua -- which are too
    light for the taste of hardcore typographers.. \r\n\r\nBut perhaps my experience
    is not typical. Verification, please?\r\n\r\nSo while I admire the goal and scope
    of the Paperback typeface, I think it may be an uphill battle to persuade trade
    publishers to get with the program."

    have covers designed by freelancers (apparently at a good rate to Penguin) and

    I suppose mostly the cover sells the product to a browser, while the content will
    be read no matter what so less effort is put into it.\r\nTim"

    The Penguin-70 designers were paid 70 pounds per cover. And all the interior typesetting

    Penguin as the books sell at \xA31.50. Some of them are excerpts, some short stories,
    some unpublished, I wasn't entirely recommending them, they seem rather overpriced,
    rather because they celebrate 70 years of paperbacks and seem set to continue
    publishing them.\r\nTim"
