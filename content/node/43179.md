  point me to any typefaces commonly associated with this particular \"vernacular.\"\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nGeorge"

  body: "I don't think you'll find too many common threads in the areas you mentioned,
    although they are connected to the medical profession. \r\nIn the US, hospital
    signs (as far as room identification and wayfinding) will need to conform to the
    ADA. The main identification for the hospitals is of course at the discretion
    of whatever designer the architectural firm contracted.\r\nReports and research
    probably have common typefaces, but they'll be more related to the most common
    software used to produce and read them (TNR, Courier, Helvetica, Verdana, etc.)\r\n\r\nOK,
    so that wasn't particularly helpful, but maybe it's a warning?\r\nFor info on
    Signs, you can search the articles on SignWeb, from Sign of the Times (sign industry)
    magazine here:\r\n[[http://www.signweb.com/search.php]]\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "Basically I'm just putting together a series of posters (the theme being
    \"sickness\"), and I'm try to see if I can find any typefaces that might easily
    trigger a \"medical\" association.\r\n\r\nDidn't really require an astounding
    amount of research, but obviously lots of humanist sans-serifs for hospital signage,
    etc ...\r\n\r\nAlso, probably not a font, but I was also looking at some prescription
    labels like this one: http://www.abacusrx.com/images/pics/Forms/Rx%20Label.JPG\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone know of any typeface that recalls this sort of lettering?\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help."

    your example shows how technical limitations associated with label creation are
    actually what many people associate with medical text. \r\n\r\nA lot of examples
    are more like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PrescriptionBottle_5383.jpg]"

    you can browse <a href=\"http://www.abacusrx.com/images/pics/Forms/Rx%20Label.JPG\">similar</a>
    typefaces in \u201C<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/category/myfonts/computer/\">computer

    start in 1968 when ATF produced <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/ocra/\">OCR-A</a>,
    one of the first optical character recognition typefaces. John Scheppler\u2019s
    Orator for IBM typewriters is another interesting case ; Anuthin Wongsunkakon\u2019
    Carbon (T-26) is interesting, too, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nA student of mine is
    graduating with a thesis on this (your post) topic, the title will be something
    like \u201CMedical Point of Purchase.\u201D If you want to share some information
    I can put you in touch with him."
