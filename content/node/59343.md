  I would try anyways. \r\n\r\nI've lurked around for awhile and I know a bunch of
  the guys from LogoPond.com have recommended this site over and over gain. So, I
  decided to finally get off my ass and register. \r\n\r\nI live in San Francisco.
  I work for Pandora.com designing \"digital brand experiences\" for advertisers (that's
  right, I am the guy that annoys you while you listen to music) and every once in
  awhile I take some brand identity projects on the side as well. \r\n\r\nI am slowly
  becoming a typeophile as I play 'Guess that Typeface' while I walk down the street
  and make my own type treatments for logos. \r\n\r\nAnyways, that is all. Flame on. "

    They probably have their own agency design their stuff though. It takes a certain
    kind of genius to manipulate people and make them enjoy it. I knew what was happening,
    but I still clicked on that damn button and added \u201CVolkswagon CC Radio\u201D
    to my stations."

    use Crispin Porter + Bogusky as their creative agency. But, we have been known
    to do some creative stuff ourselves every once in awhile. \r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nNeed

  body: "@Conway: Interesting. Pandora actually might be one of the better things
    that's happened to me in the last 6 months. It helps me get through the long days
    at the office. The first thing I noticed when I joined was how unique of an advertising
    opportunity you guys have created by developing what you call a \u201Cdigital
    brand experience\u201D. What an innovative way to capture an audience at peak
    engagement. I actually took a look at your media kit to see your rates, but didn't
    find any. Does Pandora have a separate rate card?"

  body: "I am not sure if we have a standard rate card available to the public. I
    am meeting with one of the sales people from NY on Friday though, so I can ask.
    As far as I know, generally our campaigns involve custom pitches. So, we negotiate
    premium CPMs based on the experience involved, whether we will be developing the
    creative, how long it's running, etc. If you are interested in learning more for
    a campaign you're working on I could have a sales person contact you :-)\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\nNeed
