  body: Emillie, without looking into it too deeply, I would set the tagline in sentence
    case if the tagline is a sentence &#40;e.g. It&#39;s the real thing.&#41; If it&#39;s
    a fragment of a sentence or a clever combination of words that makes a phrase,
    I would set it both ways and see which looks more appropriate &#40;though truthfully
    I can&#39;t think of a single instance of this right now&#41;.
