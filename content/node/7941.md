  printing. Any language, any purpose &#40;phone books, newspapers, cheap paperbacks,
  labels &amp; such&#41;. Which ones can handle the punishments of bad paper and small
  sizes without breaking a sweat? <BR> <BR>kris.

    can. If you avoid the Normal weight &#40;too thin, mistake in first digital version&#41;
    and use the Book, set it &#43;3 units in Quark &#40;i.e. 15 in InDesign&#41;,
    it works really well at sizes around 8pt and below. It was, after all, designed
    for the German Post Office to be used on their forms. The original version in
    1985 was made for typesetting on cathode tube machines which only had 1200 dpi
    resolution and would often output at less to save time. I

  body: '<i>like its narrowness, and its &#34;g&#34;</i> <BR> <BR>Well, of course
    I have my own single-decker g for those occasions. And the narrowness is not a
    problem as long as you track properly. <BR> <BR>BTW: FF Unit is tracked very openly
    and appears not quite as narrow as Meta. Works well, too.  <BR> <BR>Generally,
    of course, the wider the letters, the more open the counters, the more legible
    and the less danger of spots. But always at the expense of space. I once made
    Meta set at 103%. That helped, and it was still 10% more economical than Helvetica.'

    <BR> <BR>So far, there are only these 3 weights. They were made for the admin
    people at MetaDesign way back in 1996 because the double-g looked spotty on screen
    &#40;these were the old days with small screens and bad rendering&#41;. That is
    exactly the point Hrant made about that character causing problems in adverse
    conditions. <BR> <BR>If we did an alternate g for all the weights of Meta, it
    would be a nightmare to distribute. You would have to double the number of fonts
    overnight! And we

    the width constraint there actually creates a stong tension against the need to
    make type wide at small sizes. BTW, every lo-fi freak needs to read Tracy&#39;s
    &#34;Telephone Directories&#34; article in issue #15 of the old series of Typographica
    &#40;1958&#41;, pp 4-15. He even shows non-Latin stuff. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    tried and tested, but i have a few illustrations from 1985, showing Helvetica
    &#40;actually: Holsatia from Hell&#41;, electronically condensed, and an early
    version of Meta, uncondensed. Very unrefined, but we could set narrower columns,
    get more columns on the page and save around 8% content. And that was without
    any customisation. But the German Post Office decided to stick with Helvetica
    and its bastard sisters until 3 years ago, when they joined the Frutiger bandwaggon.
