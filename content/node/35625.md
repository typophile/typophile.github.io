  body: Are you trying to enter Hebrew text or Latin text? If you have a mixed Hebrew
    and Latin font, you need to support the MS Latin 1 codepage as well as the Hebrew
    codepage in order to input Latin text. I consider this a bug, but I'm not sure
    if MS Office does.

    kind of problem with Word 2003.
