  body: I enjoyed staying in Hillside Court from '02-'03. I don't know how it compares
    to renting a flat, but it is one of the most affordable University owned accomodations.
    The best part is that it was inhabited by a diverse range of students, most of
    whom were enrolled in graduate programs. Part of a University education is being
    able to meet and learn from other students who have experiences and backgrounds
    different from your own -- which Hillside provided.

    No brokers fees and what not, and you can find roommates on that page also. I'm
    in Sherfield, and enjoy the nice bike rides in the morning, but if you are part
    time, two years of a hall would be a bit much. Yes, start on Gerry's reading list
    and start brainstorming ideas for your dissertation!

  body: "I stayed in Sherfield and it was great. It is generally accepted as the best
    at Reading but the priciest. Still, I found it worth the extra money. It is self
    catering, and it has a computer room (you won't find internet connection in the
    rooms except via dial up).  The Junior Common Room is great with lots of nice
    activities (quiz night, pub crawl, xmas dinners...) and the rooms are ok. Also,
    we had cleaners come and clean our rooms once a week, and the kitchen everry weekday.
    Seeing the long reading list you have to go through, you wouldn't want to waste
    time cleaning your room.\r\n\r\nAlso, the way it is situated, you get lots of
    socializing happening in the kitchen that you share with 7 other people. I had
    amazing friends there...\r\n\r\nIt is 25 minutes walk away from the typography
    department. 40 minutes from the town center. Not so convenient but it's worth
    it. Still, it was close to the sports center on campus (8 minutes). It is around
    1.5 hours away from St. Brides in London where you will be spending a lot of time...\r\n\r\nA
    very popular restaurant is Katmandu Kitchen on Christchurch. Ask for the Chicken
    Dry Fry with Pilau rice and Pashwari naan. mmmm.\r\n\r\nSince you are staying
    for 2 years, you might want to first stay in a Hall (definitely self catering
    though) and to move out later. \r\n\r\nBest of luck for next year... I am jealous
    :)\r\n\r\nBy the way, an amazing book is Creative Lettering Today by Michael Harvey.
    I would start reading there. Type Sign Symbol is a good start. Also, Gerry's recommendation
    to me as a first book to read was Counterpunch. All good books. Enjoy... Last
    time I checked the list was 7 pages long.\r\n\r\nHint: learn how to properly type
    set a bibliography, it will come in handy. Also, would be good to start practicing
    with a broad nib to get the feel of letters. \r\n"

    indeed. I'm very fond of the Katmandu Kitchen and always manage to arrange to
    eat there at least once when I am in Reading. Some of the Nepalese dishes, which
    all seem to include fruit, are interesting and not typical 'Ruby Murray' fare.
    Last time I was there I had a mild curry with lychees in it. To be honest, I probably
    wouldn't order it again, but it was good in a horizon-expanding way."

  body: "If you decide for one of the University's Halls, don't make the mistake of
    choosing a fully-catered room. Not only it is twice the price of a self-catered
    one, but also because the food choice is not worth of the difference (too much
    fried food for someone used to good fresh fish, like me).\r\nBesides, you would
    have to follow their very strickt mealtimes, and find yourself wasting money on
    meals that you couldn't \"attend\", or running back and forth to the department/hall
    to be on time for lectures/meals (and I'm not even accounting the queueing time...).\r\n\r\nI'm
    staying in Bridges, right next to the department, in a self-catered room and I
    quite like it. The JCR (Junior Common Room) fee, that every student has to pay
    (40 pounds/year), covers for lots of things you can use and do, including tennis
    court, pool table, TV room with cable channels, music room, computer room, newspappers,
    DVD movie nights, bar quiz, karaoke, etc.\r\nASDA, a big supermarket, is not far.
    It's also very cheap, and groceries for a whole week (breakfast, lunch and supper
    everyday) hardly cost over 25 pounds.\r\nThe kitchen is fully equipped with 2
    stoves (with oven), fridge, freezer, microwave, toaster, boiler, cutlery, crockery
    and individual cupboards.\r\nThe floor is shared by 12 students, mainly post-graduates.
    We also have a (very nice and friendly) cleaning lady that comes 4 times a week,
    to do the kitchen and bathroom.\r\n\r\nThat's about it!\r\n\r\nPS: In addition,
    this year's students are leaving a pair of top-notch tennis rackets as the legacy

    Counterpunch \r\nand Richard Southall: Printer\u2019s type in the twentieth century.\r\nRead
    also John D. Berry: Language Culture Type.\r\nIf you want some advice on academic
    writing, have a look at\r\nUmberto Eco: Wie man eine wissenschaftliche Abschlussarbeit
