  body: "Enclosing signs should precede the character that they enclose, not follow
    it. I believe this is standard for Unicode enclosing signs, regardless of text
    direction.\r\n\r\nWhether the combination of a particular enclosing sign and a
    particular following character render in a desired fashion, though, depends on
    the individual font. Some fonts provide ligatures of particular combinations expected
    to be used, others provide complex GPOS positioning (including, in the case of
    some Arabic enclosing signs, handling of multiple characters within the sign,
    e.g. end of ayah marks containing numbers), and some trust to blind luck. "

    work either, with the Calibri font\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Combining
    Enclosing Circle_6392.png]\r\n\r\nBut, by typing the character '1' followed by
    a space and then the enclosing circle, and by typing '2' followed by space and
    the enclosing circle, I got this result with the Cambria font which seems to be
    ok.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Combining Enclosing Circle_3614.png]\r\n\r\nBut
    I tried the same procedure with Calibri without success."

  body: "As I wrote, this ends up being dependent on the capabilities of the individual
    font. Enclosing signs are a pain in the neck to deal with, because ideally the
    enclosed glyphs are optimised for that use, e.g. you might want to reduce the
    size of numerals and perhaps lift them off the baseline. There are always going
    to be limits on what combinations work acceptably, and the great majority of fonts
    don't support enclosing marks at all.\r\n\r\nRe. the behaviour you note with Cambria,
    it is entirely possible that what is happening is a Word-specific character substitution
    that happens to be supported by Cambria. It is likely that the resulting display
    that you see is actually a behing-the-scenes mapping to the circled numeral characters
    in the Unicode 2460 range. I also suspect that what you see working for Cambria
    roman might not work for the other fonts in the family. The roman has an expanded
    glyph set on account of its maths coverage."

    the U+20DD glyph. The second of these is not Cambria at all. The circled number
    characters were added to Cambria only relatively recently, so it is possible that
    the version you have does not support them, in which case Word is applying font
    switching to render the character with some other font. Word tries never to fail
    to display a character, so will opt to switch fonts rather than show a .notdef
    box (there may be an option setting to disable this).\r\n\r\nThis is what the
