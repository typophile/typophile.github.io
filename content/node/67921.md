  body: "Probably right as far as the \"Heart City.\"\r\n\r\nAngelina for the rest
    seems correct. But the uppercase letters aren't from Angelina (looking at the
    slideshow on the homepage). It seems the LC are Angelina... Any ideas as to those
    uppers?"

  body: "Well there aren't any uc letters in \"health center\".\r\nYou mean the ones
    on the website in the flash animation?\r\nThe H is obviously taken from what Mike
    recognized as custom. You have to take into account that the other two (S and
    C) are hand-lettered too."
