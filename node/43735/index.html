  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This logo is a relaunch attempt.  It was voted favorite from five sketches I put up on our hobby music myspace page.  Surprisedly, it&rsquo;s the most straightforward idea I came up with, containing none of the nice little twists I now buried with the other sketches.</p>
<p>Taking it from here &hellip; can anyone suggest a good font type for the name?</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is that it should match the music (here&rsquo;s the [[http://www.myspace.com/antillmusic|myspace page]]). The current font is a modified Blackoak but it reminds me more of a retroish rock band with country elements.  Something a little more modern which translates the individual character would be nice.  In the music club beats are layered with processed samples of the instruments plus my lazy vocals ;)</p>
<p>Also, the type should look good in a complex, detailed variant (see 1) which we could use on a t-shirt, a reduced variant (see 2) for use on the website and finally a very reduced variant (see 3) for small flexprinting on a cap.  Even in scenario 3 it should be legible.</p>
<p>What do you think?  General logo suggestions are welcome, too, since I&rsquo;m still working on the sketch.  Once everything&rsquo;s looking ok I&rsquo;ll concentrate on color, kerning etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think most of us were immediately frightened off by the fact that you were taking advice from a myspace poll. Also, typophile was 404 for quite a while earlier this week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you my impression of what you&rsquo;ve got so far.</p>
<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s way too detailed, and the mix of photographic elements with (what looks like) pencil lines doesn&rsquo;t achieve rugged or grunge - it just looks sloppy. The third version is headed in the right direction, but it&rsquo;s far from complete.</p>
<p>I think (?) your spikes are meant to be a platform, but the way it looks now, it&rsquo;s really more of a violent-looking star. I&rsquo;d scrap the four &ldquo;spikes&rdquo; on the bottom and replace them with a mirror image of the top three spikes (which, btw, I would redraw to center the middle spike, and/or exaggerate the angles for drama.)</p>
<p>Repeat after me; simple is GOOD. Simple is memorable, and simple will save you money. I suggest spending some time looking at vector art (icons and logos) and find some microphone art you like to inspire your rendering. (but stay away from gradients - $$$) Of your three versions, none will scale down AND up and still look like a microphone. The last one is looking &hellip; well, naughty.</p>
<p>In short, I think the silence on this thread is collectively saying; &ldquo;The font is the least of your worries.&rdquo; Sorry if this seemed harsh, but it&rsquo;s honest. I hope it helps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Alaskan,</p>
<p>ok, &lsquo;Simple is Good&rsquo;.  Thank you for your critique and suggestions.</p>
<p>Simplifying the starlike structure at the bottom and seeking inspiration in vector based art for the complex grille will be my next go.</p>
<p>The grille appears to be the most incompatible portion in regard to flexprint.  This should - at least - solve the technical shortcomings ;)</p>
<p>Regarding aesthetics, I like the violent appearance of &lsquo;the star&rsquo;.  People who record in studios will identify it as a classic microphone shock mount.  Others will take it as a star. Exaggerating this structure is a good suggestion.  Also, I don&rsquo;t mind the phallic qualities of the design, it&rsquo;s not for streamlined corporate purposes so that&rsquo;s ok.</p>
<p>Too bad, I would have loved to integrate a font I&rsquo;m confident with but I guess I&rsquo;ll have to take care of that in step two.</p>
<p>No worries about the &lsquo;harshness&rsquo; of your feedback.  I&rsquo;ve posted here to learn, not for pats on my back. It was a lot milder than I expected and inspirational.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Listening to their music, I&rsquo;d go for a brush script style font, like the style <a href="http://sudtipos.com/home" target="_blank">Sudtipos</a> specializes in. Something nice and fat like Calgary Script or Milk Script. Then I would draw an illustration to match the type.</p>
