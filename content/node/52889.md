body: "The attached monogram was done for a client over a month ago. They were happy
  with it, though they are currently exploring conventional logos and marks.\r\n\r\nIt
  is possible they will come back this. But either way, I am not quite satisfied with
  it and would love the assistance of some expert eyes and feedback on how I might
  make this a stronger mark.\r\n\r\nIt began as a hand-drawn sketch in outlines. I
  then filled in the letterforms and cleaned up. It's a fairly odd and cramped intersection
  of shapes, but while it feels a little imbalanced now, I think it has potential.
  My own eye tells me that it's the W (in part) that is throwing it off\u2026\r\n\r\nIt
  is supposed to read WBS, though I'm not sure the hierarchy matters all that much.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\n\r\n\u2014Matthew"

  body: The B and S are beautiful. Do not change them if you can help it. The rigid
    W just doesn't go. Remove it and draw a new one that is <em>curvy</em> and fits
    comfortably into the spaces. If you can, make the side arms of the new W reach
    up and curl over the top; this would help it seem more like it could be first.

    sugguestions!

    this again soon. I agree about the comments on the W and am excited to implement.
