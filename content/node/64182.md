body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI have a problem with various font files on one of my systems.
  They appear perfectly on one system, but on the other the \"BoldItalic\" is actually
  \"Thin\", the \"Hairline\" is \"Normal\" (etc etc etc.... it varies with the font
  in question).\r\n\r\nSome fonts are from Adobe Font Folio OpenType Edition (the
  original one), and one is \"Omnes\" by Joshua Darden. They appear perfect on my
  laptop, but as I don't use them on my laptop but on my desktop, it's a PITA! :D\r\n\r\nThe
  only difference between the two systems is that the laptop (where the fonts are
  fine) is XP SP2, whereas my design machine is XP SP3. I don't know if this has anything
  to do with it...\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nMartin"

    otf or ttf files - from either the fonts folder or even just a store folder without
    them installed).

  body: My first guess is that you have corrupted fonts in the cache on your desktop.
    Uninstall the fonts, clear the caches, reboot, and reinstall the fonts.

    system, deleted fntcache.dat from system32, rebooted, reinstalled omnes, and STILL
    only have 8 out of 18 variants available.\r\n\r\nThanks for the tip anyway :-)
    Sorry it didn't work though.\r\n\r\nM"

    on my workstation, and when the fonts are NOT installed, double clicking on the
    file name (previewing the fonts) works fine. Install them though, and they mess
    up again.\r\n\r\nEdit: same behaviour with Venetian from font folio.\r\n\r\nDoh!\r\n\r\nM"
