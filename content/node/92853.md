body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm new to this. I have searched the web and found a million
  pointers on how to choose a Logo & typeface, so much that I'm more lost than before
  my research, so I decided to ask someone who knows what they're talking about. Here
  it is:\r\n\r\nI am starting a new small business selling personalized gift baskets,
  and later on, I would like to open a small concept store to sell different items
  created by friends and myself (custom jewelry, gift items, small revamped pieces
  of furniture...), all items will be ecological. The name will be \"Basket Case\".\r\n\r\nI
  would like to create a logo with a script/handwritten font, and use a Serif font
  for body texts (brochures, letters...). The mood has to be classy, have character,
  and convey the image of something personal and thoughtful. (not looney like the
  name suggests, more like \"crazy about making your gifts special\").  \r\n\r\nWould
  anyone kindly point me in the right direction as to the following:\r\n-A script/handwritten
  font for the logo\r\n-A Serif font that goes well with the one for the logo\r\n-Headers
  and Titles (would it be good to use the logo font, the text font, or a third one).\r\n\r\nOnce
  I get your replies, I'll design the logo and post it for your reviews.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a million!!!!\r\n"

    since you might end up needing Arabic (although it's Maghribi style):\r\nhttp://www.rosettatype.com/Aisha\r\n\r\nIf
    you're sure you want a serif face, you might need to make a total break from the
    \"handwritten\" styles above and shoot for a strong contrast. If you go this route
    please consider this (which BTW renders great onscreen):\r\nhttp://ernestinefont.com/\r\n\r\nOne
    other thing: I can see you're a designer of sorts yourself, but you might be better
    off hiring a designer specifically experienced in typography and identity work.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "@hrant: Loved Olicana. I'll see what I can come up with.\r\nI wont be needing
      arabic at all. Sans serif I feel are a bit too formal/not soft enough, do you
      agree? \r\nAs for hiring a professional, I'm trying to do as much as possible
      myself, for the feel of the whole thing. If I hit a wall, however, I'll definitely
      seek professional help.\r\n\r\n@5star: Nice font! but i'm looking for something
      a little more romantic"

    I'm not sure it matches Olicana.\r\n\r\nYou might also consider a semi-serif,
