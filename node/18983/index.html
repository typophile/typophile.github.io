The "strange thing" is actually why I made the page to begin with. I was testing my font to see if it could be used for every Latin based language. As you can see, Azurbaijani has a character which I did not put in the face yet. The upsidedown "e" (forgive me, I don't know the real name for it) is set in Adobe Garamond Premier Pro so I could see what it was supposed to look like. There were also several Vietnamese glyphs which were not included, too many to show.

That sounds like a good euphemism for relative values, which to me is one of the biggest problems facing an orderly society. That being said, I have found dialogue regarding religion and politics should be avoided in groups like this, as there are usually strong feelings and it can get out of hand.

Having moderators can help, but people often say things they wouldn't say in person when they are relatively anonymous.</div>

Relative values (by which we probably mean different things) never killed anybody. But really what I meant is that some people think it's already hard enough to make good decisions in this world and age without recluses who died thousands of years ago telling us how to live. If you <cite>must</cite> take the word of an arbitrary document, at least use a contemporary one.

Well, good going then!

While I find that when people don't say certain
things "in person", it's mostly out of weakness.

That may be true in the sense that certain things, if said to someone's face, might provide consequences like facial reconstruction.

I don't think that a contemporary document is automatically more valuable than an ancient one at all.

The real problem with the Bible lies in interpretation. If you look at it like Joseph Campbell, like a myth (which for some reason has always been necessary in a society), you are not going to use it to harm. It actually contains some very nice metaphors.

In this case, blame the messenger, not the message…

Since apparently no topic is too far off topic here, I'd like to inquire about something I heard; I was told that due to DOJ crackdowns over the years, the main force in organized crime has shifted from the Italian mafia, to the Armenian mafia (not sure that is the right term).

Do you know if this is true? It seems unlikely since I have run into that many Armenians. If true, can you offer an explanation?

The main Armenian I knew (sort of) was a guy named Don Manasian (sp?), who had quite a temper, which caused a big turnover in the sales force he was in charge of. One buyer told me that they had six different salesman in 18 months, and she didn't know who the current one was. This allowed me to make big inroads for my company back in the early 80s. (As is usually the case, I'm told he really was a sweetie at heart)

Well, maybe not.

The difficulty is that with the Babel or UN texts (thanx for that link too Chris), one doesn't know how much text is required to get the full character set.

But it's good having a lot of text, because you get to see different character combinations.</div>

if everybody wants to have such texts - why not try to collect them here? start a thread where everyone can throw in sentences in his mother tongue with as many glyphs as possible (different glyphs).

		<div class="commentbody"><em>The upsidedown “e” (forgive me, I don’t know the real name for it)</em>

The usual name among English speakers is 'schwa'.

This leads me to the juvenile IPA joke that this letter with a palatalized hook should be called 'shwing'.


<em>Because preferential treatment of the bible is offensive to most of the world?</em>

Offensive? Most of the population of the planet are not Tibetan Buddhists, but that hardly means that they find citations from or translations of the Tibetan Book of the Dead to be offensive. Similarly, most of the population of the planet is not Moslem, but that doesn't mean they find quotes from the Qur'an offensive. Just because you don't subscribe to something doesn't mean that you find it offensive.

If you are offended by the application of e.g. a fundamentalist protestant interpretation of the Bible to US foreign policy and domestic education policy, that is all the more reason to welcome the presence of scripture within genuinely humanist (in the traditional sense of the word) and scholarly contexts such as the Omniglot website.  Trust me, that last thing you want to do is to push the Bible out of public discourse and into a ghetto where it is read and interpreted only by sectarian fundamentalists.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, the schwa represented by the upside down e is I believe used in the phonetic alphabet for the English sound of the 'e' in 'the', when it is pronounced before a consonant: 'the pear'. (In 'the apple' it becomes a long 'e'.)

The name for the sound I believe comes from Hebrew, which has the same vowel sound in it as the English schwa. (In modern Hebrew it is pronounced schva, though.) In the Hebrew system of vowel points the sound is represented by two dots arranged vertically under the letter. The same sign can also be silent--which way to read it is dictated by complicated rules.  

EDIT: I cross posted with Tim. The Wikipedia article has more than you ever wanted to know about the schwa!</div>

In this case, no. Chinese doesn't have a schwa among its sounds, at least in Mandarin. 

The fact is that 'schwa' is a Hebrew word originally. My point here--relevant to your and Chris questioning the propriety of using a Biblical text--is that religious texts, including the tower of Babel story, are a part of our cultural heritage, and often they are not religious or sectarian in their connotations--such as the word 'schwa'.  

Our history is intertwined with the history of religions and religious texts. Type history in particular is intertwined with the printing of the the Bible, in Latin, Greek, Hebrew,and many other scripts and languages. So using the Tower of Babel passage to illustrate different scripts is beautifully apt, and not in the least sectarian or offensive.</div>

You don't get to decide for everybody. Neither does your god.

If one must use text from a single religion, the considerate,
gracious person would do so from a religion other than his own.
Preaching one's faith in an arbitrary document is offensive to
a great many people. It is no different than... what I happen
to be doing now! :-)  But the key thing is that I realize and
admit it, and am not being manipulative.

I didn't put up the Omniglot site. <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/aboutme.htm">This fellow</a> did, and I'm sure from his bio that proselytizing was the furthest thing from his mind. He was just using the oldest familiar story on the origin of many languages to illustrate many languages. He wasn't endorsing it.   

The Tower of Babel story is only directly critical of the Babylonian religion, and that is long, long gone. As its overt target is antique in the extreme, people normally read story as a warning against arrogance, or trying to be a god yourself, or something like that. It is not particularly sectarian, and in fact at least three different religions--Judaism, Christianity and Islam--claim Genesis as their own. Since this particular story doesn't preach in favor of any sect it is inoffensive to almost everybody, including those like me who take it as myth or legend. </div>

Yes, so it is indeed a deeply offensive story to the very many people on the planet who acknowledge no authority beyond themselves.</div>

Ever heard of Agnosticism, John? (Oh yes you have.)
"Authority"? What a self-serving farce.

Is this continued misrepresentation a result of manipulation or insecurity?

Yet once again: what's offensive isn't the story, it's focusing a
type specimen on the text of a specific religion. Outside of one's
little village, it's plain ugly.

Well the point of the story is not to get above yourself, and think you run the world. Religious or not, it seems to me that modesty is a becoming garment. 

Being a rationalist, as well as religious, I do not take any text as infallible authority, including any religious text. I like to think that a true religiousity, acknowleging the awesome and mysterious powers that sustain us and the universe, will engender an appropriate humility. And often this is the case. Unfortunately, some religious people have interpreted and still do interpret their texts as infallible instructions to persecute others. However, the abuses by some religious people is not a reason to censor and banish religious references from public discourse. </div>

There are at least three things wrong with this argument.

First, you are reacting as if the author of the web site is proselytizing for religion, or that any quote of a religious text has to be for the purpose of proselytizing, which is just ridiculous. Many people, including myself, quote religious texts from many religions as well as anti-religious texts, to make points clear and not endorse the views.    
 
Second, as you repeatedly ignore, but is fact, this text is not of one specific religion, but of at least three. Those familiar with this text as a result of being raised in societies with widespread Judaism, Christianity or Islam constitute not a little village but over half of humanity. And if you focus on those peoples who use alphabetic texts--the point of the exercise--it is probably three-quarters of this group. As an English language site, practically everyone will be familiar with the story. 

Finally, your dark hints about 'one religion' and 'little village' seem to allude to the fact that this is from the Hebrew Bible, and hence Jewish. The idea that this guy has the purpose of proselytizing for Judaism--and I doubt he is Jewish--is laughable. What is "just plain ugly" are your dark hints that quoting anything Jewish is offensive. </div>
