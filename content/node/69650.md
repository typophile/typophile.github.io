  body: "If you use their <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/testDriver/index.php?productLineID=100013\">Test
    Driver</a>, you can match which weights are used against the \"PUBLIC\" image
    in a separate window. Just go through the weights in the Test Driver until you
    find the match.\r\n\r\nGood luck/have fun."
