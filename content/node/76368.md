body: "Union Bank re-branded last year with a new logo. In addition, they seem to
  have introduced a new typeface that they use in their billboard text, but I haven't
  found anyone remarking upon it.\r\n\r\nAfter a close encounter with it on a bus
  ad I've become quite fascinated with it.\r\n\r\nIdentifont and WhatTheFont were
  no help. It seems to be somewhere between Trebuchet and FF Info Display.\r\n\r\nAttached
  is a cut down version of the text from a billboard. I haven't been able to find
  any more photos of their advertising using this typeface online. I'll try and take
  a photo of the bus or other advertising if I chance upon it again.\r\n\r\nAny help
  is appreciated! Thanks!"

  body: Looks like one of those jobs where an ad agency takes on the task of custom
    typeface design themselves without seeking a professional. It usually starts with
    modifying a font (in this case, Trebuchet) because that's the easiest route for
    someone without the skill required to make something truly new. If you want a
    proper font in this genre, check out <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/ff_strada/?affid=99346">FF
    Strada</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/foco/?affid=99346">Foco</a>.

  body: Coincidentally (or maybe not) Kris Sowersby created a <a href="http://klim.co.nz/custom_serrano.php">custom
    face</a> for New Zealand bank around the same time. Whoever did the Union Bank
    job must have liked it.

  body: "I suspected this could be a custom job, are those as comprehensive as this?
    Because I compared it bit by bit to Trebuchet, and it seems rather wide-randing
    in terms of all the tweaks applied.\r\n\r\nThanks for the response, I'll definitely
    look into those!"

    typeface from scratch.

    but I\u2019d like to point out that the typeface Union Bank used back then is
    not custom, but <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-GyvRLA\">Domestos Sans</a> (2000)
    by  Gunter Schwarzmaier. "

    released.
