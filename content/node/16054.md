  W. Phinney was a prolific 19th-century American type designer. He started with the
  Dickinson Foundry of Boston, and practised both type design and management. He eventually
  acquired the type foundry. In 1892 he was a key player in the formation of [[American
  Type Founders]] or ATF from many other foundries. Phinney started out in a position
  equivalent to \"artistic director\" and oversaw the consolidation of the member
  foundries' type collections into one library, deciding what to toss out and what
  to keep.\r\n\r\nPhinney also purchased [[Frederic Goudy]]'s first typeface, giving
  Goudy $10, which was twice what the newcomer had asked. Phinney himself added the
  lowercase to Goudy's all-caps several years later. The resulting typeface was \"Camelot.\"\r\n\r\nMany
  of the typeface designs credited to Joseph W. Phinney are based on earlier typefaces,
  ranging from blatant knockoffs to definite revisions. For example, Phinney's Satanick,
  Kelmscott and Jenson Old Style are directly \"borrowed\" from [[William Morris]]'
  work. (Jenson Old Style was later itself revived as Italia).  Cloister Black is
  based on the earlier Caslon Text, and Globe Gothic has a long prior lineage.\r\n\r\nJ.W.
  Phinney ultimately rose to be third in command of ATF, a senior vice president.
  He died in 1934, having retired from active work right around the time ATF fell
  on hard times during the depression (it went into bankruptcy in 1934).\r\n\r\nTypographer
  and occasional type designer [[Thomas Phinney|Thomas W. Phinney]] (1965-) is distantly
  related to J.W. Phinney, but is not a descendant. He did a presentation with much
  biographical information about JWP at the 2003 ATypI conference in Vancouver, and
  still collects more details whenever possible."
