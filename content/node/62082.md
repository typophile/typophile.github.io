  Herb\r\nLubalin International Student Design Competition with the theme 'the price
  of\r\nilliteracy'.  As I sit on the board of our local literacy council, I would
  love to \r\nsee the results of the competition.  I don't know in what future issue
  the results were\r\npublished.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n"
