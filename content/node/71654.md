    from Greater Albion Typefounders, who have other fonts with similar qualities,
    although not as close to this look.\r\n\r\nYour font does seem to be a font (rather
    than hand-drawn), but I don't recognize it, and can't say it looks familiar. \r\n\r\n-

    on the logo. Or do you just need to recreate the logo? "

    so the exact font would be great.  The closest thing I have is Harrington, but
    I'll check out Bromwich.  I'm a perfectionist, so having the font would be great.
    :)\r\nThanks all..."

    'I', 'O', and 'S' are perfect matches. The other letters would take minimal customization.\r\n\r\n
