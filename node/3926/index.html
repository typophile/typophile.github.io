<div class=commentbody>We had a discussion about FedEx recently (maybe in Typo-L). <br> <br>Take a look at the 'elf' trademark. The 'f' is pretty quirky, the 'e' is too big. I wouldn't call this good typography. But I would regard the *mark* (the image) very good, unique and catchy. <br> <br><a href=http://www.elf.fr/indexus.html target=_top>http://www.elf.fr/indexus.html</a> <br> <br> <br>So what is the conclusion? Maybe that typographic excellence isn't everything when creating corporate identity.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> FedEx <br> <br>The lesson for me is: don't be so subtle that only other designers notice the effect... <br> <br>The "reverse" arrow between "E" and "x": <br><a href=http://www.fedex.com/ target=_top>http://www.fedex.com/</a> <br> <br>> Maybe that typographic excellence isn't everything when creating corporate identity. <br> <br>Very interesting and astute observation. <br> <br>Another one that bugs me (or actually "bugged", since they recently changed it - except it's still bad, just in a different way) is the old Eye magazine logo: what the hell was that rediculously heavy, uncompensated "y"?!

<div class=commentbody> Re: Fedex. <br> <br>While I was never one to fawn over the FedEx <br>logo, I can't help wonder if perhaps the <br>designer wanted it to be first a logotype and <br>second a clever hidden arrow. <br> <br>Re: Eye <br> <br>I always thought the old "eye" mark was <br>quite illustrative.

<div class=commentbody>> I can't help wonder if perhaps the designer wanted it to be first a logotype and second a clever hidden arrow. <br> <br>Well, I'd guess so too, but I think the arrow is too hidden, my point being that the designer was maybe appealing more to himself/other_designers than "users"; making the arrow more obvious (like by gently highlighting the negative space in some way) would have drawn jeers from other designers (the shame, the ridicule!), but would have ellicited "that's kinda neat"s from users. Which is more important? <br> <br>Here's an example of an ingenious negative-space trick that doesn't need any help: <a href=http://www.bigten.org/ target=_top>http://www.bigten.org/</a> <br>(Note: The Big Ten Conference is actually 11 teams now.) <br> <br>> I was sad when they redesigned it. <br> <br>The whole redesign looks wannabe to me: going in the wrong direction, backwards to what used to be cool 5 years ago or something. At least they kept the sublime Proforma. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody> Joe // <br> <br>The Big 10 used to have 10 teams. In the 90s, because they wanted more revenue, they added Penn State, a football powerhouse coached by Joe Paterno. That's probably when they changed their logo. <br> <br>But there's another conference that's probably the cause of your confusion: The Big 12. There used to be something called the Southwest Conference. They took 10 teams from that conference, added two more - that's the Big 12. <br> <br>Why they have two Minnesota logos on their web site, I have no idea. <br> <br>If they add another team, then they can just update the negative space I guess, a little more difficult with a '2' than a '1'. <br> <br>bj </div>

<div class=commentbody> What? They've changed from the original logotype? I always thought that was a classic; it could well have been designed in the thirties by some rogue Bauhaus ne'er do well. <br>And personally, I like their approach to fast food compared to the burger chains. Their ingredients may be factory-farmed but the experience of walking into a Subway you never visited before is a bit more like a roll of the dice than the totally predictable experience at any given McDonalds etc. The care or lack thereof that the Subway "sandwich artists" give to your sub is something to behold. It's an intensive interaction the like of which you don't even get at a sit-down $12 entr&#233;e restaurant. <br>I hope the logo debacle isn't some sort of indication that an unwelcome change is in the offing. <br> <br>And let's not forget that their interior decor features late 19th/early 20th century newspaper reproductions covering the walls. - full of nice examples of the use of Cheltenham, amongst other types. There must have been some sort of typophile involved in their early retail design team. It would be nice to know the story behind this. </div>

<div class=commentbody><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/2526.gif alt=Avaya> <br>There seem to be several people taking credit for this identity. Both <a href=http://www.tbd-sf.com/ target=_blank> TBD</a> and <a href=http://felixsockwell.com/ target=_blank> Felix Sockwell</a> list it on their sites. While Felix credits Joel Templin (The T in TBD) as creative director, TBD doesn't acknowledge Felix at all, though I know they frequently work together, so I am confused as to who did what and for whom. <br> <br>As for the original vs. the "client ruined" design, I prefer the latter. The first is totally impractical when it comes to application. While neither of them are stunning, the final version is credible, unique and surprisingly memorable. <br> <br>What I find more objectionable is that a designer would post a disclaimer on his site lambasting his client. Every project is a collaborative effort, and often the results are less than we feel we could have achieved if left to our own devices. But the fact of the matter is that design is a service industry, not an artistic autocracy. Our clients are an essential part of the equation, and bad-mouthing them discredits design as a profession.</div>

<div class=commentbody> i'm in the service industry? wow. i dont feel like i am... are YOU? if so, god help us all. <br>christopher, i respect your opinion (tho only halfheartedly), but had you seen the original animation design (a dandylion,seen above, and its delivery- "avaya") you would immediately barf on <br>seeing the "ruined", yes RUINED version. even Joel <br>Templin (who i designed it for) hated to see it ruined, tho he gladly accepts credit for it and my NCAYV logo. I will be taking the logo lecture on tour (with cohort tom vasquez) later this month <br>in des moisnes, then san francsco, denver, etc. if you really want to hear me rant on about shitty logo and type designs i encourage you to come and hurl things at me in person. <br>- oh, one last word on the "service" idea- i find that most designers who cry this pitiful mantra to be looking for an excuse for their own shortcomings. if you cant win dont blame the industry you helped to create. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Felix, <br> <br>I can only speak for myself, but yes, <i>I</i> am in the service industry. Why don't you feel like you are? <br> <br>I don't think service is a pitiful mantra, and we don't make excuses for our shortcomings - which is why we don't blame our clients for ruining our design - we take responsibility for our work. <br> <br>As for "winning," We win when our client wins. That's just our deal. <br> <br>I will most assuredly attend your San Francisco lecture, not to hurl things at you, but because I admire your work (if not your attitude). Tell you what, I'll take you out to lunch. Some place with good food <i>and</i> service. What do you say? <br> <br> <br>And, hey, what happened to the disclaimer in question? Seems to have been taken off your site...</div>
