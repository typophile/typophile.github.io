body: "This is a request for a font, either existing (best\u2014saves effort) or new
  (great project for a typophile). It\u2019s non-commercial, so payment can only be
  in the form of acknowledgement. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m part of a group that hosts port
  tastings \u2014 for ourselves, not as a business. Port bottles used to be labelled
  with a physical stencil (you can see where this is going) through which white paint
  was sprayed or painted. Examples of such bottles: [[http://www.jdawiseman.com/port/20100629_20071029_k85.jpg|1]]

  (with apologies for the focus problem in the second and third pictures).\r\n\r\nAt
  a tasting it is important that people don\u2019t get confused. There must always
  be a clear answer to the question <strong>What is in this glass?</strong>. For which
  purposes there is PostScript program (author: yours truly) that makes all the paperwork
  required to organise a large tasting.\r\n<ul><li>[[http://www.jdawiseman.com/papers/placemat/placemat.html|Manual
  for PostScript program]], leading to\r\n<li>[[http://www.jdawiseman.com/papers/placemat/placemat.ps|PostScript
  code itself]].</ul>Within the manual page is a [[http://www.jdawiseman.com/papers/placemat/placemat.html#examples|paragraph
  of links to examples of the output]], or readers might prefer to start with [[http://www.jdawiseman.com/papers/placemat/placemat.png|a
  simple PNG example]]. \r\n\r\nThe titles in the centre of the circles should be
  a font which really should be called <code>VintagePortStencil</code>. Characters
  needed are:<ul><li><strong>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</strong>;</li>\r\n<li><strong>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</strong>;</li>\r\n<li><strong>0123456789</strong>
  (upper case only);</li>\r\n<li><strong>\xE1\xF1\xE7\xE9</strong> (as in C\xE1 (C\xE1lem),
  M\xF1 (Quinta do Ma\xF1uela), P\xE7 (Po\xE7as), C\xE7 (Morgadio da Cal\xE7ada),
  R\xE9 (R\xE9ccua));</li>\r\n<li><strong>+</strong> (as in Pt+);</li>\r\n<li><strong>&</strong>
  (as in Silva & Cosens, Marks & Spencer);</li>\r\n<li><strong>?</strong> (as in unknown).</li></ul>\r\n\r\nIs
  there such a typeface already? Does anybody have the time energy enthusiasm to make
  one? Am I asking in the right place? Does this forum have a rule banning such requests?\r\n\r\nFYI,
  I have started (a currently content-free) discussion on the same subject at [[http://www.ThePortForum.com/viewtopic.php?t=4105|www.ThePortForum.com/viewtopic.php?t=4105]].\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much."

  body: "Thank you. \r\n\r\nA typical port house might declare a vintage of a few
    thousand cases: call it twenty thousand bottles. Some houses many more. So the
    physical stencils had to be very robust.\r\n\r\nPlantain Stencil has several delicate
    cuts, not needed for the purpose of holding together a metal stencil, and delicate
    in appearance. E.g., compare with [[http://www.jdawiseman.com/port/20100629_20071029_k85.jpg|example
    1]] the \u2018K\u2019 (top-right cut) and \u2018N\u2019 (both cuts redundant).\r\n\r\nFrom
    the other list the obvious choice is Stencil Antiqua, which has the same problem
    in the \u20185\u2019 and the \u2018N\u2019, though the \u2018K\u2019 is excellent.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    after a robust stencil, in style late-Victorian or early-20C English. These modern
    stencils could withstand hundreds of thousands of digital uses, but not twenty
    thousand physical bottles.\r\n\r\nEdit: happy to cough up for the right font.
    But not to pay thousands."

    is indeed naive or bold, because it wouldn\u2019t be a conjoint project. You ask,
    whether somebody can do something for <em>you</em>. You don\u2019t ask, whether
    somebody is interested in a conjoint project with task sharing. The absolute minimum
    payment would be an enhancement of the designer\u2019s reputation, but in case
    of a non-commercial winetasting I assume, that the designer couldn\u2019t increase
    his reputation. So his only motivation could be the interest in your project.
    But he could not really participate, if it remains <em>only</em> your project.
    I doubt, that you find someone, who is willing to invest months of work just for
    your acknowledgement. Renovating my rooms would be also a non-commercial project.
    But in those cases I am asking my friends, which requires a counterperformance
    sooner or later, or I am paying a craftsman. But I would not ask strangers, whether
    they are willing to help me just for fun."

    that the designer can simply make a stencil font from one of his existing fonts,
    because the outlines cannot become arbitrary broken. And most fonts could probably
    not changed in that way, at least not, if they shall not be pure deco stencils.
    It probably would be less work than creating a stencil font from the scratch and
    not necessarily worse. But if the designer was not already interested in creating
    such a font, he probably is asking, how big the market for such a font is."

    for tasting software. Sorry. ;-)\r\n\r\nJulian, I think the challenge here is
    that you have very specific aesthetic requirements which any currently available
    face is unlikely to meet. There have been several reasonable approximations suggested,
    none of which is close enough for you. \r\n\r\nI do understand why these don\u2019t
    satisfy your sensibilities (I was just looking at some Kopke bottles the other
    day); but as you acknowledge, any font that does will not likely have any other
    commercial potential. So this project would essentially be a labor of love. And
    unless you can find someone with the skills and time *and* who shares your specific
    interest in this pet project, it\u2019s not likely to materialize.\r\n\r\nYou
    may have to decide whether to compromise with one of the given suggestions, in
    order to get something at least a bit more suggestive of stenciled port bottles,
    or just stick with what you have. Finding a perfect match is looking unlikely.\r\n\r\nBest
