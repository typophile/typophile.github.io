  sure if you like this constant barrage of 'help needed', posts, but im pretty sure
  it begins to grate after a while. Hopefully I have some questions that will spark
  some interest and more importantly not have been discussed a thousand times before.
  Please feel free to answer the questions of just give your general opinion after
  getting the gist of the subject from the questions.\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nDo
  you think that if you had to use the old school techniques of design such as letter
  pressing and typesetting it would hinder your creativity when creating a piece?\r\n\r\nDo
  you think that dafont.com is damaging the respect and overall quality of typography/type
  design? (students may use it in replacement to not having the cash to buy quality
  fonts, is that the future of type? ill educated students with no respect for good
  typography?)\r\n\r\nWhat would be your defence to people that say that its easy
  to pick a font and be a graphic designer if you know how to use photoshop?\r\n\r\nDo
  you think designers such as wim crouwel, jan tschichold etc, are seen as \u2018craftsmen\u2019,
  more so than david carson and neville brody because of their traditional analogue
  methods?\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI have scoured
  the posts and been inspired by the knowledge that comes from the discussions on
  here and would be ecstatic for any help furthering my exploration in to the subject.\r\n\r\nNice
  one.\r\n\r\nSean\r\n\r\n"

    means but the eye and the mind still control the output, not the tools of the

  body: "Thanks alot, that was almost poetic!\r\n\r\nI have been finding more and
    more that peoples feelings towards this is that, concept and education about typefaces
    will always reign supreme when designing.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I have found
    interesting though is, that I personally find myself respecting the 'oldschool',
    designers more for some reason. Maybe its because there is more mystery behind
    their era and my lack of knowledge of the design process back then...It may also
    be because I do not like the aesthetic of Carson and Brody, however, I still very
    much respect what they did for the art and how they created something new as a
    sort of rebellion to the modernist way of typography.\r\n\r\nBut why do I have
    more respect for the oldschool?..... I cant lay my finger on it... is it the process
    they used? Does the strict rules of modernism make it more of a craft rather than
    the punkish nature of carsons spreads?\r\n\r\nI have a lot to think about, and
    I very much appreciate your input."

    body: "Sorry, reading through I noticed something. I feel that the mind of today
      may not be as sharp as the minds of past thanks to the internet but most importantly
      the teaching of today...\r\n\r\nThis view point is coming from the teachings
      in England. \r\n\r\nNot enough time is dedicated to the history of the craft
      on courses and while much time is spent on concept development and learning
      the programs....I find myself lacking in knowledge of the history of graphic
      design and typography. I have found myself respecting the craft so much more
      now after having researching the history for this essay. If others are in the
      same position as me and are using lacklustre fonts from freeware fonts rather
      than using and understanding classics readily available, then what does this
      mean for the future of type?"

  body: "I don't claim to be as knowledgeable about type as the other person who replied
    to you on this thread, but there is something I thought worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nI
    agree that the digital era hasn't destroyed craftsmanship in type design. People
    who do the work to design new typefaces with care and love are still doing so.\r\n\r\nBut
    there is a reason that the digital era has made it <em>seem</em> like that has
    happened. When typefaces were designed by punch-cutting, they were rough and crude
    by today's standards - but they were designed with care for serious use. When
    the pantograph came along, typefaces could now be smooth and slick - but it also
    became possible to create all sorts of elaborate display typefaces, some of which
    were used without discretion and taste. In the digital age, almost anyone can
    download the software to design a typeface.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Gresham's Law
    doesn't apply to typefaces. The technology which empowers the craftsman, and makes
    him more productive, may also create a vast clutter of inferior and plagiarized
    typefaces, but as that clutter can simply be ignored, it does not have to be a
    real threat to craftsmanship."

  body: Has has the print era ruined the craftsmanship of manuscript? No, not really.
    Usually, a successor technology builds on the history, knowledge and skill of
    its predecessor, as is well known in case of Gutenberg. There may be fewer people
    nowadays able to perform a historical craft, but there are more people studying
    it, looking for enlightenment and inspiration from the old, for it is deeply connected
    to the new. The essence of acient craftsmanship lives on -- but in evolved forms.

  body: "No.\r\n\r\nI think there is more craftsmanship today than there has ever
    been. Digital technology has enabled more creative people than ever, many of them
    self-taught, to express themselves in a professional way. Just because the technology
    is digital doesn't mean it's not craft. I see no difference between using French
    curves and a Rotring pen and drawing using Beziers on a computer, in fact I don't
    miss the former at all. Creating something original is what matters, now more
    people have the means to achieve that and also to market it."

  body: "Judging by the work we're seeing from the likes of Kris Sowersby, Jos Buivenga
    and others, the craft is alive and well. \r\n\r\nHave a look at some of the discussions
    here on Typophile. Eric Gill is more alive than ever. There's always some way
    the giants of letters make their way into typographic discourse. \r\n\r\nAs for
    the *appreciation* of typography, perhaps it isn't like it used to be. How many
    people still find beauty and pleasure in a well-set book? I know I do. There's
    also the issue of piracy, which affects the craft in terms of economics, but despite
    that there doesn't seem to be any shortage of type designers. At least from a
    consumer perspective. \r\n\r\nPerhaps a discussion the commodification of type
    will yield more answers. "

    is that time has already buried the \"clutter\" in past eras while we still have
    it all about in ours.\r\n\r\n\"The chaff which the wind driveth away\" is an old
    term, we just are waiting for the wind to blow :-)\r\n\r\nThe other side is that
    the production cycle to make anything is orders of magnitude faster now so an
    object (or typeface) comes to pass quickly and Peter Principles quickly.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I am nearing the conclusion of my essay, of which has a word limit of 6000,
    and I have already written 9000 (thank god for appendix). I have covered the 'the
    international typographic style'(Wim Crouwel), 'the New typography'(Jan Tschichold),David
    Carson and Neville Brody in order to understand the pioneers of the ages and to
    see the society that they lived in the time in order to see what affected their
    craft at the time.\r\n\r\nI have then looked at factors of the past decade that
    may or may not have effected typography, such as 'Going Green', 'Affordable high
    quality technology' (everyones a Graphic designer with their helvetica bold and
    their fancy 1000mega pixel new camera),the internet (Freeware font sites,being
    able to see what typographers from all round the globe are producing)and the rebellion
    against the desktop computer and reverting to hand rendered type.\r\n\r\nIf you
    can think of other areas that have affected it feel free to add. One question
    I would like to pose to you all is. 'Is Sagmeister's way of producing typographic
    pieces typography?'\r\n\r\nMany of his pieces dont follow the orthodox uniform
    lettering etc, e.g when he had lettering carved into his body, and creating type
    by wrapping plastic round a fence. I ask because this is a trend I have noticed
    and I was wondering what you hardcore type....types think about it.\r\n\r\nPS.
    you can see why I have gone over the word limit"
