  body: Just got my Stewf shirt today. The image is pretty cool, and though I&#39;m
    waiting anxiously for these print-on-demand places like Pixeltees and CafePress
    to get past heat transfers for their shirts, I will say that at least they cut
    around the transfer so it isn&#39;t some big nearly transparent square on the
    shirt and instead looks more like old-school iron-on.
