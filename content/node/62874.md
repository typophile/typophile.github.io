  to Monotype Imaging, the new 20-font typeface suite, Ysobel\u2122 Pro (pronounced
  \u201CIsabel\u201D), is designed for both text and display applications.\r\n\r\nDesigned
  by Robin Nicholas, Alice Savoie and Delve Withrington, the Ysobel typefaces are
  intended primarily for newspaper and periodical copy.\r\n\r\nNicholas notes that
  the idea for the Ysobel faces started when he was asked to create a custom, updated
  version of the classic Century Schoolbook typeface, which was designed to be an
  extremely readable typeface \u2013 one that made its appearance in school textbooks
  beginning in the early 1900s. "
