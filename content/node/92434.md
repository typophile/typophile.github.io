  font in this logo (just to clarify, she doesn't want it for her own logo, but for
  other graphics like banners). Can someone tell me what this font is or if there's
  a font similar to it I can use?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.katiefultonphotography.com/v1site_images/splash_logo.jpg?var=0.00542300%201335274442]]"

    if I can find a free font that's similar. :)
