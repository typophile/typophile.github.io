body: "I keep getting asked (by multiple sources) to create PDFs of Orange County
  Register (newspaper, OC southern California) articles. I've been using fonts that
  are close to what they use, but darn it, I'd like them to be exact if I can. Can
  anyone i.d. the fonts in this JPEG, or does anyone know offhand what fonts the OC
  Register uses? Thanks.\r\n\r\n(BTW - I _think_ that the main serif font is Century
  Schoolbook... it's close, but not a perfect match)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OCReg_5581.jpg]"

    so many variations of fonts like that for newspapers.\r\nThe T (for example) doesn\u2019t
    look like Corona, though."

    their website. Looks like the fonts are:\r\n\r\nInterstate (thanks, bshaykin)\r\n\r\nBenton
    Modern One\r\n\r\nFrom MyFonts.com:\r\n\r\nMorris Fuller Benton of USA\r\nBorn:
    Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 1872\r\nDied: Morristown, New Jersey, 1948\r\n\r\nLeading
    American type designer who designed typefaces and managed the typographic design
    program at ATF from 1892 until 1937; son of Linn Boyd Benton.\r\n\r\n...Benton
    designed (is credited for) Century Expanded and Century Schoolbook, which must
    be why it's (CS) so close. I couldn't find a listing for Benton Modern, does anyone
    know who carries it, or is it a custom job for the paper/publisher?\r\n\r\n"
