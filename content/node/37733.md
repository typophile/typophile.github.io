body: "I am currently researching Linotype\u2019s fonts Aptifer and Vialog as part
  of a dissertation on typefaces designed for use in a variety of mediums and circumstances.
  I was able to get the big specimen for Aptifer from M\xE5rten Thavenius, but got
  no response when I requested more information\u2014via info@linotype.com\u2014on
  Vialog than is available in the <em>Vialog: Leading the Way</em> booklet. Aside
  from the <em>History of Vialog</em> article on Linotype.com, is there any other
  material available about Vialog, and if so, how can I get a copy?"
