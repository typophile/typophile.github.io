    could be a nice alternative, but unfortunately there is no italic cut. \r\n \r\nAlso
    in the same ball park is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=5&displayfontid=C.100936.0.0&fontRendererText=Recent+Work\">School

  body: "I tend to think the script is handwritten, but I agree that School Script
    is closest for matching the initial letters (R, W, S, J). To match the 'feel'
    better, consider Panache's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/greyhound-script/\">Greyhound
    Script</a>, Letraset <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=LFT1006000\">Bickley
    Script</a>, and Veer's <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000092\">Mr
