body: "Firstly, what font, has someone outlined for that logo?\r\n\r\nI have to recreate
  this. The client probably is most concerned with that.\r\n\r\nMyself, am most concerned
  with finding that font for the body. It's similar to Franklin Gothic, but softer
  and more pleasant with slightly rounded edges. The tail on the LC y doesn't curl
  up so much as Fr. Gothic either.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scan46745_4098.jpg]"

  body: The name and title are rather loosely spaced, leading me to believe that they're
    probably set in Megaron, Varityper's answer to Helvetica...

  body: "Hmm...well that seems pretty much unavailable.\r\n\r\nWhat the Font choices--Nimbus
    Sans seems like a close fit. Now to see if someone would bother paying $40 for
    two weights. IF a nice free approximation can't be found, then I suppose this
    one is solved. But any suggestions are welcome."

  body: You could try the TeXGyre or Ghostscript fonts. Both are based on URW's old
    freeware release of Nimbus Sans.

  body: I had never heard of that collection. I don't know how I feel about that.
    But, it works wonderfully.

  body: Seems there is usually a grand canyon separating the freeware font world from
    the payware font world.
