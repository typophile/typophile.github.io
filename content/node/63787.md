body: "Looking for the font used on the main page (and logo) of:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.goforthinstitute.com/\r\n\r\nLooks
  like a Garamond, feels like a Garamond, but has a few differences. \r\n\r\nThings
  to look for:\r\n\r\n- Upper case 'J' is tapered at the end (like Granjon)\r\n- Lower
  case 't' doesn't have a cusp in the northwest corner\r\n- Ball terminal on lower
  case 'r' and 'a'\r\n- Flattened top on left side of upper case 'A'\r\n- Squiggly
  '?'\r\n\r\nIt's almost like the lower case of Byington mixed with the upper case
  of Adobe Garamond, but not quite. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n - Lex "
