  that offers \"paperbag\" coverstock paper samples. i have a client that wants to
  get all their collateral done with this type of subtrate, but, as with most clients,
  have no idea about the differences and nuances of paper. i've called most of the
  local printers here in ATL, and all have lead to dead ends. does anyone know of
  any resources? thanks!!\r\n\r\nMB"

    looked promising. I know the wholesalers in Ontario ... but Georgia is going to
    be different. Usually one of these places will have salespeople that can source
    anything out for you.\r\n\r\n(I am assuming you are looking for the kind of paper
    used to make brown paper bags.)"
