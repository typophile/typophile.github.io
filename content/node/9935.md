  body: MORRILL and Construction both show variations in letters that should be identical
    = hand-drawn. <BR> <BR>MARK, BUILDING &#42; REMODELING  &amp; phone number are
    hard to say, but because others were hand-drawn, that would be my guess for those
    too.

    slightly extended could approximate 647 WOOD. <BR> <BR> - Lex
