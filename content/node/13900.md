body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : En</strong>\r\n\r\nPronounced like
  it is spelled, an en is a measurement equal to half the [[em]]. An [[en dash]] is
  a dash the width of the given en. Because \"em\" and \"en\" sound so much alike,
  the en is often referred to as the \"nut,\" from which the term [[nut fractions]]
  is derived.\r\n"
