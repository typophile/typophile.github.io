body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI know this is going to sound completely ridiculous, but
  I have lost and forgotten the typeface I use for my own logo on my website. Yes,
  yes I know, more organization is in order. I have started cataloging all my fonts
  since, but I cannot remember what the name of this font is called. It was a free
  font, and I believe I got it from dafont.com, but after search for about an hour
  I could not find it again.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone happen to know the name of this font.
  It's characteristic is that it has those square boxes below some of the letters.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJames\r\n\r\nEdit:
  It seems I'm having issues uploading my 3kb gif, so here is a direct link to the
  font reference I am speaking of:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/21344606@N05/2074193489/\r\n\r\n"
