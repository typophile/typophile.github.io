  boldfaced font is called poluzhirniy shrift (\u2018semi-bold font\u2019), because
  there existed fully-boldfaced shapes which are out of use since the beginning of
  the twentieth century.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any other information on
  this, or clarification? It sounds interesting to me since I once, many many moons
  ago, started to learn Russian. I made it as far as being able to read sentences
  and paragraphs, not understanding a darn thing of course, based on their simple
  pronunciation rules and a basic understanding of Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nAs a newly dedicated
  type designer, I guess it's my responsibility to understand all I can about scripts
  other than Latin."

  body: "In the Soviet times <em>Poluzhirnyi</em> was the standard term for the companion
    boldface. <em>Zhirnyi</em> was used for \u2018black\u2019, like in <a href=\"http://paratype.ru/pstore/default.asp?search=Black%20Grotesk&fcode=PT_BLG&params=1\"
    target=\"_blank\"><em>zhirnyi grotesk</em></a> (\u2018black grotesque\u2019).
    That nomenclature was borrowed directly from German (German foundries dominated
    the Russian market in late 19th\u2013early 20th century). The peculiar and often
    confusing <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schriftschnitt\" target=\"_blank\">German
    terminology</a> was <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/17643\" target=\"_blank\">discussed</a>
    here a number of times. In current practice and usage Russian terminology mirrors
    the English, so <a href=\"http://paratype.ru/help/term/terms.asp?code=304\" target=\"_blank\"><em>poluzhirnyi</em></a>
    translates as \u2018semi-\u2019 or \u2018demibold\u2019."

    still make something called \"bold\" but we in English would call it \"black\"?\r\n\r\n"

    target="_blank"><em>poluzhirnyi</em></a> and <a href="http://paratype.ru/help/term/terms.asp?code=43"
    target="_blank"><em>zhirnyi</em></a> <em>shrift</em>.
