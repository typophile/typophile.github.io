  I enjoy using and understanding type. \r\n\r\nI am completely discouraged by the
  amount of Spam that finds it's way into the various discussions. Right now there
  are over one dozen direct Spam entries on the front page of the website. Is there
  an Administrator out there that can AND WILL remove all of this crap? Of course
  it would be really nice if there was a way to try and avoid the issue up front but
  in that I am less hopeful. \r\n\r\nMy guess is that this comment will probably be
  viewed as Spam. This used to be a really enjoyable site to take in the comments
  and expertise of so many respected type designers. Now, they appear to have all
  taken their insights to other locations and I am sure that many were driven away
  by the excessive Spam on the site. So sad... \r\n\r\n"

    I see it; sometimes it disappears immediately, but lately it can take up to 24
    hours before it disappears.\r\n\r\nI've also written to the admins about a spamming
    issue on the Font Identification forum, but never received an answer...."

    website has radically change since is relaunch. Whenever I read a new title thread
    I wonder if is it spam or not. I can not explain why there is so much spam, however
    this situation force me to reduce my contribution to the website.  It is a sad
    situation for me and probably for all typophile members."
