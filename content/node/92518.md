  body: "I think this is more recent than eary 1900. \r\n\r\nJESUS ONLY style may
    be matched by Univers Condensed Bold.\r\n\r\nThe type in the logo seems hand made.\r\n\r\nThe
    small type style may be matched by Univers Extended.\r\n\r\nThe sample is too
    small to discern."

  body: The creator of the logo died in 1931...so, not likely that it's recent.  I
    have that Univers Condensed font but I'm not actually seeing the same comparison
    you've made.  Thank you!
