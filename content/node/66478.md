  using Gotham and Stag together I like them as heads and standfirsts but I don't
  think either are quite right for body copy. Would using a third font for body be
  overkill?\r\n\r\nhttp://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4292433135_0195d0c208_o.jpg"

  body: I agree a different typeface is needed for body copy.

  body: I know you didn't ask for typography advice, but if you're going to space
    the Gotham caps so loosely I'd add more leading.

  body: Mm, I've struggled using Stag for body. It's great for headings. I ended up
    using it for brochures and adverts but I'll admit it doesn't work so well for
    immersive reading. I'll be interested to see what you end up using with it.

  body: "You need to really pay attention to the kerning in your title.\r\n\r\nA crude
    but good way to start with kerning is to imagine water filling the spaces between
    the letterforms. You are attempting to adjust the spacing between characters so
    that the amount of water is about the same or similar between each letter. Over
    time you'll develop a keener sense of balancing out the negative space.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a small detail but it helps to improve the tightness of the composition."
