  body: "William T. Sniffin's design of Rivioli for  American Typefounders is essentially
    a clone of Rudolf Koch'a Antiqua/Eva with the addition of the echo lines.\r\nIt
    seems clear to me that the engraver adapted the Antiqua/Eva/Rivoli design for
    the Pyrenees logo.\r\nBTW, the original Rivoli series, as shown in the American
    Typefounders catalog of 1934, also had a very attractive Italic which AFAIK has
    not been digitized. The Italic included alternate swash capitals for _A_, _B_,
    _D_, _E_, _G_, _H_ and a half dozen more letters.\r\nIMHO Rudolf Koch was one
    of the greatest type designers of the 20th century. His designs, including this
    one,  are definitely not industrial or mechanical.\r\nDon"

  body: "Good find Elizabeth. The ATF 1923 book is sitting right beside me and I never
    thought to look inside it for the draped shields. AFAIK nobody has made a digital
    version.\r\nBTW I'm at a loss for words to characterize this style. Not Victorian,
    not modern, not neo-classical -- perhaps ivy league ladies college?\r\nDon"
