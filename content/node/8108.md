body: Is there a way to print the &#34;plain text&#34; version &#40;the default for
  Terminal in OS X&#41; of Monaco from InDesign or Illustrator? Is this an issue of
  anti-aliasing needing to be turned off somehow? I can use the plain text version
  in TextEdit, but I&#39;m doing more elaborate page layouts that would be much better
  suited to InDesign. Is there a pixel/bitmapped version of Monaco I don&#39;t know
  about?  Thanks so much.
