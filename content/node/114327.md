body: Hi, I would like som opinions on my work combining the classic News Gothic typeface
  with the modern face Source Sans Pro by Paul Hunt on my website. I think the two
  pair well together, due to e g similar x-height, but I'm sure you guys have some
  valuable feedback. What do you think? http://lindesvard.se

  body: "News Gothic looks quite nice (though not as beautiful as on Adobe Typekit,
    but I guess that's due to different rendering techniques), but Source Sans Pro
    doesn't render that well here. Here's a [[http://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee503/msilvertant/Lindesvaumlrd.jpg|screenshot]],
    though it's slightly blurry, which is not how your text renders.\r\n\r\nIt's not
    very bad though. Helvetica is much worse on the web in a Windows environment.
    But if you look at the /R in Source Sans Pro, I don't think it's hinted properly.
    The bowl of /p and /b also renders too wide I think.\r\n\r\nRendering aside, the
    typefaces do work quite well together, but I'm not quite sure why it's important
    to have the same x-height here."

  body: Hi Martin, thanks for your input. You're right. Source Sans looks awful in
    the image you linked to. Hm, wonder why. What browser? In my browsers on the Mac,
    the page has a far better look-and-feel. Regarding similar x-height, I think it
    creates a stronger feeling of kinship between the two faces. Maybe not a critical
    issue but I do think it matters.

  body: "I'm using Chrome, but it looks the same in other browsers. I think it has
    to do with the differences in rendering methods of text on Mac and Windows.\r\n\r\nI
    think the x-height is relevant if you're going to use the typefaces at the same
    point size. Otherwise, I think the stronger feeling of kinship is mostly an appreciation
    of consistency and has no actual effect on the aesthetics. I might be wrong though."
