  \r\n\r\nI'm working on a project that requires a typeface like the \"500\" in this
  example. Its usage will be more for letters than numerals but this sample here really
  captures the essence of what I'm looking for. Modern meets athletic.\r\n\r\nI ask
  all of you great wizards and gurus here for help identifying this font or pointing
  me to something close.\r\n\r\nThe Under Armour typeface is another example of what
  I feel is modern meets athletic and what I'm looking for, although the style of
  the \"500\" is closer to what I need.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.starrett-lehigh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/under-armour-inc-logo.gif\">\r\n\r\nAll
  recommendations will be greatly appreciated. Gratitude in advance."

    it does not have the blackletter style angled terminations to vertical strokes
    where they meet the top horizontal.\r\nI seem to recall seeing such a font recently
    but, unfortunately have not been able to find it again.\r\nDon"
