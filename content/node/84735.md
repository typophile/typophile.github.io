body: "I've been looking for a serif with the same qualities of Archer. I will admit
  that I prefer a sans-serif over a serif. Something about the majority of serif fonts
  makes me feel like I need to arch my back and keep my chin up. I feel like wine
  and cheese would be served at a serif party while the sans-serif party would have
  an open bar with a stellar selection of craft beer.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is \"Archer\",
  which for me conveys a warmth and friendliness other serifs lack. It says \"welcome,
  have a seat and make yourself comfortable\". Yet the font exudes elegance and sophistication
  at the same time. \r\n\r\nArcher has been popping up everywhere for a while. I see
  it in lots of magazine and ad campaigns. I wasn't surprised when Publix (grocery
  store in the southeast) used it for their most recent campaign. However I wasn't
  really ready to find it gracing the title of every Ore-Ida potato product in the
  frozen food section there. Two days later . . . Quaker Oatmeal. \r\n\r\nMy point:
  as a designer and lover of type, I like to keep things fresh. I can't create a logo
  for a cutting-edge, sophisticated interior designer using the Ore-Ida potato font
  that is easily spotted in so many common places. \r\n\r\nIs there another well-designed
  font family capable of pulling off all of the same qualities of archer? Can there
  be another font with such lovely ball terminals that succeeds without coming across
  as a knock-off? I thought I found the answer a while back in House Industry's \"Eames
  Century Modern\". But somehow I never feel as satisfied when using it in designs
  or copy in which I want to exude friendliness and a bit of personality. \r\n\r\nI'm
  new to typophile and would love to get your suggestions and feedback. I did a keyword
  search for \"archer\" before posting and didn't find anything of interest. So please,
  don't bite if this has been discussed in a previous post/s. (pretend I added a smiley
  face here using punctuation)\r\n\r\nI often have imaginative conversations and sometimes
  documented dialogues with fonts as if they are human. If you don't find this disturbing
  I might share the break-up letter I drafted for Archer."

  body: "So happy to have received quick responses! \r\n\r\nFrank, I'm not crazy about
    the way Sentinel reads when used in sentence and paragraph form. I'm sure there
    is a technical word for that but you will have to excuse me as I am a self-taught
    designer with an English Literature degree.\r\n\r\neliason . . . Bodoni Egyptian.
    That's it. I never thought about looking for a slab serif with a feminine side.
    I've always been drawn to slab serifs for their clean and simple lines. But I
    never thought one could look so good in paragraph form. I like the fact that it
    is slightly condensed, as I feel like I am often in need of a more condensed font
    in order to lend more of my beloved white space. And equally important, it doesn't
    come across as an archer knock-off. \r\n\r\nThe lightest version is especially
    nice. Thank you, thank you!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>It is lamentable how widespread Archer's use is becoming.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is not the amount of use but amount of entirely inappropriate usage. Archer
    is fine for the many places where a cute and quirky slab serif is called for.
    But it can look ridiculous when used outside of those places. Two insane uses
    that spring to mind were a tank-themed Cheetos web campaign and the new identity
    for Wells Fargo retail banks. Archer is far from the only misused fonts, it just
    seems that way because H&FJ's great marketing efforts make it easily identifiable. "

  body: "I guess it's obvious how much I know about typography classification and
    terminology- I wasn't even classifying Archer as a slab serif- just a serif with
    ball terminals. I think of Lubalin Graph and Rockwell when I think of a slab serif.
    \r\n\r\nNick, I am in agreement with your statement. That is why I've rarely used
    archer in all caps- there's never enough of those lovely ball terminals to leave
    me satisfied. \r\n\r\nIt's the way I see archer bold used that bothers me but
    this is probably a personal preference of style.\r\n\r\nBree is nice but a little
    feminine for my taste. \r\n\r\nSo are most of the people in here typographers/aspiring
    typographers? "
