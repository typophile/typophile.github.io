    in your comment to \"[at]\" to avoid spambots (i.e., \"typographer [at] gmail
    dot com\")."

    stupid as to not figure out that\r\n\"dot com\" stands for \".com\" and\r\nthe
    \"at\" that comes earlier is a\r\nstand-in for an \"@\"-sign?\r\n\r\nespecially
    when the \"dot com\" is\r\npreceded by something like \"gmail\",\r\nor something
    similarly obvious?\r\n\r\ni mean, if it was some government\r\nprogrammer, sure,
    that would be\r\ngood enough to fool them, but\r\nthese spammers seem crafty...\r\n\r\nso
    i think it's just superstitious.\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n\r\n"

    was, to my awareness, a quaint substitute term for \"Hell\" in black-and-white
    1950s movies. As in, \"Oh, goodness, Mary Jane! Sometimes I just wish Chet would
    just go to Halifax!\"\r\n\r\nBut the actual experience was pretty much just like
    that Annie Proulx novel, The Shipping News. Cold, windy, harsh, barren and beautiful.
    \r\n\r\nLike I like my women and my glyphs.\r\n\r\n(Just kiddin'!) Wondering out
    loud \u2014 what typefaces have come out of that region? What the Halifax would
    they look like?"
