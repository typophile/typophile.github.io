  decreasing the space between \u017F and z, latinizing the \xDF-ligature.)"

  body: Thanks, but what I want is for this to happen automatically every time the
    pair occurs, without having to repeat the \kern command.

  body: "I wouldn't recommand changing the font metrics because it would make your
    tex code less portable. You can define a simple command like:\r\n\r\n\\def\\fz{\\symbol{383}\\kern-0.14emz}\r\n\r\nI
    suggest using \\f instead because command names are restricted to basic ASCII.
    Using \\symbol{383} also makes the command usable in different encodings or language.\r\n\r\nHope
    this help\r\n"
