  body: Hi Michael. Keeping in mind that these may not be available digitally, <a
    href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/red_rooster/consort_condensed/?sample_text=CHESS%20AND%20CARD%20GAMES">Consort
    Condensed</a> might be your best bet for the big type on the top sample with <a
    href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/excelsior_std_ot_virtual/?sample_text=handy%20Manual%20of%20all%20the%20known&sample_size=24">Excelsior</a>
    for text.

  body: The second headline face reminds me of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/urw/romana/?sample_text=MORE%20LIGHT%20asonic%20Ritual">Romana</a>,
    but that's certainly not it.

  body: "Thanks, Stephen.\r\n\r\nI know I've seen similars to the \"Masonic Ritual\"
    typeface, but none come to mind. The \"R\" reminds me of Parkinson, but otherwise
    it's not all that close.\r\n\r\n"

  body: For the sans, the best match I can think of is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_bau/?sample_text=DUNCAN%E2%80%99S">FF
    Bau</a>. Or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/process/maple_ot/?sample_text=DUNCAN%E2%80%99S">Maple</a>
    for more flavor.
