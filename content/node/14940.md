  body: "That looks good, I can read it clearly, except fot the t/c combination which
    could appear as j/c, I cannot think of a solution offhand but I'm sure there is
    one. Of lesser concern, I would look at kerning it a bit tighter, the vertical
    of the G/n could extend to close to the x-height/baseline and it might be worth
    investigating having the swash in the opposite direction, the s seems a bit out
    of scale (not much though).\r\nTim"

  body: Have you shown this to people who don't know what its supposed to mean? That's
    pretty much the ultimate test for readability and sucess for these. Timd has some
    good points.
