  body: Oh, he'd get over it. It isn't the best, but don't you think he'd at least
    be happy that a lettering scheme he made was still in use 90 years after he made
    it?

    find it a bit odd seeing it all over everything that TfL have anything to do with,
    and it makes for very odd body copy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's just over used (and in
    the wrong places)."

  body: "I like the London Underground face (heck I bought P-22's version), but the
    lack of optical compensation at stroke joins has always bothered me. Seems like
    Johnston was a much better calligrapher than typeface designer.\r\n\r\nIt also
    seems that Eric Gill, who worked quite a bit with Johnston on the London Underground
    typeface, either had learned a lot by the time he did Gill Sans, or was well served
    by his collaboration with Monotype, as it is much better executed in this regard.
    Of course, one also sees the same errors in Paul Renner's original drawings for
    Futura, but the good folks at Bauer fixed it up nicely....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    body: "Johsnton never considered his work for LU a typeface. He called it an \"alphabet\"
      for signage and display only - never envisioned some of its present uses. It
      is truly monolineal, but I still like it better than Gill for display. Johnston
      isn't perfect, but anyone that visits London knows that it just plain works.

    was reading 'London's Handwriting, the development of Edward Johnston's Underground
    Railway block-letter' by Colin Banks, and in it he states that Johnston did not
    believe in roughs, trials or mocks. Instead,\"The first complete working out,
    would if possible, be the final thing\".\r\n"
