body: "From one to the other moment it seems something very strange happened to my
  vfb files. Since today I cannot install the OpenType fonts on my Windows XP system
  which I'm problemless generating in FontLab Studio 5. It says (somewhat translated
  from Dutch): \"can't install the typeface (OpenType). Perhaps the font file is damaged.
  Aks a new one from your vendor.\" Going back to a vfb file from a few days ago and
  again generate a font without any problem does allow me to install the font. It
  seems a bug or something the like has invisibly nestled in my working files.\r\n\r\nClearing/Deleting
  windows' font cache as well as rebooting certain times didn't help. Using the .bak
  files either. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nFingers crossed..."

    one, save under a new name and see if that works?

  body: That is exactly what I was doing in the meantime as I really need to go on
    with the project. It fortunately works out well, although it isn't ideally. Thanks
    for suggestion!

  body: Ah, it seems it has something to do with kerning. When I remove all kerning
    pairs the problem is gone. But I don't want my fonts to be unkerned!

  body: Try to export to a UFO and then import the UFO into a new Fontlab vfb. That
    might clean up things.

  body: I have found sometimes that FontLab files acquire bad juju which shows up
    when you try to generate OpenType fonts. Sometimes, generating a PS Type 1 font,
    then opening it up in FontLab takes care of the problem, but sometimes it doesn't.
    In such cases, if I generate a TrueType font and open it, the problem goes away,
    but then you have to change the curves back to OpenType curves and, occasionally,
    some losses occur...
