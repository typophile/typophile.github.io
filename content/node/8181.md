  body: Hi Johanna, <BR> <BR>on Emigre&#39;s website, you can use the &#34;Type Tease&#34;
    to type in a few words in the font. You could even print that out and show it
    to others for your project. But you can&#39;t get a legal copy of the font for
    free, no matter what you want to use it for. Asking for it further would be impolite.

    the other suggestions offered here.

  body: Johanna, we don&#39;t do that here. <BR>You should &#34;reward&#34; the right
    people and just buy the thing if you need it. <BR> <BR>hhp
