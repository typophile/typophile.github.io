  second one, the closest I found was Sackers Roman. \r\n\r\nCan someone help identify? "

  body: "I don't think the first one is Matrix, even though the H looks like the Matrix
    Tall H flipped upside down. The C is especially different.\r\nThe second logo
    (YU-GI-OH) reminds me of some of Chuck Davis's work at Letterhead Fonts, particularly
    [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/antiqueshop.shtml|Antique Shop]], but I
    suspect, like many logos, that this is custom lettering. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
