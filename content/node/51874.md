  a image to help illustrate...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_5410.jpg]\r\n\r\nlooks
  like i\xB4m stuck. When i try to autoflow text it just creates blank pages. I've
  opened the text editor mode and it seems that the next page will be composed only
  by a footnote as you can see in the following image. Could that be the reason of
  this? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/02_5862.jpg]\r\n\r\nI had a similar
  situation in the past, but i can't remember how did i resolve it.\r\nProbably i'm
  being dumb, but my head is empty right now, and i'm in major stress to get this
  thing done.\r\n\r\nHope i'm making sense\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\n"

    long footnote here, I can imagine InDesign chokes.\r\n\r\nInDesign doesn't break
    footnotes at will, only if the reference is at the bottom of the text and the
    note still can't fit under it. You can even use the Keep settings to specify 2
    or more lines to hold together.\r\n\r\nSometimes the amount of space between the
    last text line and the first note seems a bit wide. Fiddling a bit with 'space
    before', or line heights of the text or in the footnote, or (last resort) make
    the text frame just a bit higher will allow another line inbetween."

    I haven't, but can I turn it on for this particular footnote only?\r\n\r\nBest\r\n"

  body: "I don't know about that moving the topic (moderators?).\r\n\r\nYou cannot
    set \"Allow footnotes to break\" per note. But, as I said, ID will not break *all*
    notes, just the ones that don't fit entirely on one page. (Logically.)\r\n\r\nBut
    -- given the constraints the page imposes -- you can select a note that you don't
    want to get broken and set its text Keep options to \"Keep together\", that will
    move that entire note <em>plus</em> the text line its reference is in to the next
    page. However, I don't see a problem. Do you really need every complete note to
    appear on the same page?\r\n\r\nWith \"Given the constraints of the page\" I mean,
    obviously, that the note and its line have to be able to fit on one page. A point
    to keep in mind with notes that long."
