body: "Hello, all. Is there a way to break up the kerning table into smaller ones
  in plain TrueType? As far as I can tell, the issue is simply that this table is
  too large in my font(s). I flattened my kerning classes to pairs, removed OT data,
  but while TypeTool, FontForge, and InDesign all see the pairs, Word doesn't. (Yes,
  I do have kerning enabled in Word.) However, when I remove glyphs (I have a lot
  of diacritics), Word can see them just fine. So, I'm pretty sure I need to break
  up the table or something; how do I do this?\r\n\r\nIt's probably worth mentioning
  that I didn't need to insert subtable statements in the OT code for the CFF version.\r\n\r\nTIA!\r\n"
