body: "I was searching for an Opentype version of Today Sans Serif on google and came
  across a link for a cheapy font package for $19.95 that contained a few well known
  fonts that a single weight sell for much more. What is weird is that in the description
  for the font, they list that they have permission from the foundry/designer. One
  was Eagle by Font Bureau and another was Coquette by Mark Simonson. I don't want
  to post a link, lest it is an illegal package, but I'll use oh-so-clever type code:
  the name is not \"descender\" but rather \"__cender\".\r\n\r\nSo, what's the story?"

    collection is completely legit. It's a nice beginner's collection. If you decide
    you don't really like type after all, you're not out much."

    packs' (unless there already is a list, of course...)

  body: The pack is a fantastic deal for the price, but it runs an <i>installer</i>
    that requires you to <i>log out</i> after it completes. What is this, Windows?
    Very annoying for those of use who'd rather manage our own font libraries. But
    still, a great deal for those looking to fill out their fledgling libraries.
