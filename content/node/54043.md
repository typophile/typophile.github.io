  government?\r\nActually I want to know, if there was a typeface, which had been
  used in the 1950s, in the beginning of the federal republic.\r\n\r\nAny idea?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot!"

    design of the german government. They used Transit first, but it was replaced
    later by Univers \u2026\r\n\r\nBut no information about corporate design in the
    50s \u2026 "

  body: "Regarding Univers, as Poms mentions, this is not the \"official German font\"\u2026
    rather, the names of Government ministries, etc. are set in a condensed Univers.
    You see their names next to the stylized flag and eagle motif.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    NeueDemos and NeuePraxis are used. Designers and agencies creating documents or
    doing design work for the Federal Government license these fonts from Linotype.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a link to the German government's official style guide:\r\nhttp://styleguide.bundesregierung.de/Webs/SG/DE/Homepage/home.html\r\n\r\nHere
