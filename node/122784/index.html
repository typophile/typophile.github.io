  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Before my question let me state my assumption, which is that point size is measured from the highest point of the letters, usually the ascenders or in some cases cap height, to the lowest point, almost always the descenders. Further, punctuation such as apostrophes, quote marks, or accents, especially accents above caps, is not counted.
I was experimenting with Times New Roman today (forgive me) and noticed that when setting 11 pt Times New Roman (Open Type) over 10.5, the ascenders and descenders do not meet.
By the math, shouldn&rsquo;t they? The highest ascenders do not touch the lowest descenders.
It must have an extremely small amount of extra space either above or below.
Is there some other way that is happening? If it is an intentional design &ldquo;feature&rdquo;, how common is it in typeface design? And is there a method to the madness?</div>

I would expect the horizontal lines that you added would touch just the tips of the ascenders &amp; descenders. So does EB Garamond already have space built in above the ascenders (but, oddly, the descenders cross the line)?</p>
<p>On lines 6 and 7, the g descender looks like it would touch the d ascender. This collision is what I would expect from a &ldquo;36 point&rdquo; typeface set on 36 line-spacing/leading, although I don&rsquo;t understand why the horizontal lines are offset.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Brian, allow me to give you a straightforward explanation using a reference to metal type.</p>
<p>Point size is determined by standards: 12 point type is .166 inches high on a metal slug. In today&rsquo;s world that could be referred to as the total of the Ascent and Descent as measured from the baseline. For example, using an EM of 1000, you might set your Ascent to 700 and your Descent to -300, totaling 1000 in height. Consideration must be given as to how the font will be used in determining these values.</p>
<p>That does not mean, nor should it mean, that your Ascenders should be 700 and your Descenders -300. One must build in vertical white space so when typeset with solid leading there is still a tiny amount of space between the lines, that amount being the decision of the designer. Dependent upon the design you can also have the design overshoot the Ascent and Descent but I would only do that for display or special-use faces such as ornate scripts.</p>
<p>The design itself merely sits in the point size space, oriented to a common baseline. There are no strict standards regarding capital size or x-height, or for ascender and descender length in relation to the other glyphs. For design comparisons, use Helvetica and Futura, and Garamond #3 with Adobe Garamond.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is helpful to you. If not, ask more questions&hellip;.   :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">George - Thank you. This makes a lot of sense and is how I understand it. I suppose that even with metal type, the ascenders and descenders would not have to take up the entire &ldquo;point size&rdquo;. I just thought it was so standard, that everyone would want to. It seems that as Michel demonstrated, it can be whatever the designer wants.
But it seems like an easy enough system to follow. What would cause a designer to not follow that measurement method? Or is it that most do follow that measurement system, but there are a few oddballs. Even so, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect Times New Roman to be a dissident!</div>

<p>That&rsquo;s not correct. I&rsquo;m a graphic designer so one of the typography experts here can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but it originally started in the days of wood and metal type when there was some additional space above and below each character, some built-in leading. This system carried over into desktop publishing.</p>
<p>So to make characters actually touch, you normally need to use leading that&rsquo;s smaller than the point size, such as 11' type with 10' leading.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Michel Boyer:
Your illustration makes an important point that had been missed in this discussion so far.</p>
<p>With foundry types, many manufacturers settled on three positions of the baseline - a standard position, for typefaces with fairly short descenders, a &ldquo;script&rdquo; or &ldquo;art&rdquo; line for faces with long descenders, and a titling line, just slightly above the bottom of the slug for titling faces.</p>
<p>This allowed different typefaces to be mixed easily - if two of the typefaces used different baselines, some leading above the one and below the other would be needed to bring the baselines into alignment, but that leading would be an integral multiple of the point, or at least the half point. Possibly, for the smallest sizes of type, of 1/4 point.</p>
<p>Whenever two typefaces with different baselines are mixed on the same line,  that means the line requires more space than the point size, as your diagram shows.</p>

<a href="http://www.thomasphinney.com/2011/03/point-size/">http://www.thomasphinney.com/2011/03/point-size/</a></p>
<p>I will again note that trying to equate font size to cap height, ascenders and descenders is a remarkably western-centric point of view. <strong>There are other languages spoken by billions of people that do not have these features!</strong> Notably Chinese, Japanese and all the Indic languages&hellip; indeed, languages spoken by close to half the world’s population.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">A related question (still for alignment, not size) is that of baseline (cf <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/base.htm)">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/base.htm)</a>. When latin letters “stand” on their baseline, as is said in the Microsoft link <em>several Indic scripts use a high “hanging baseline” to align the tops of the glyphs</em>. It can clearly be seen in the word “Hindi”:
<img src="/images/old-images/hindi_5583.png" alt="">
That should  affect how the relative sizes of parts of the glyph are perceived. Indic fonts also have various values for ascent, hhea_ascent, os2_typoascent, os2_winascent etc.  It is unclear to me how those values are related to the features of the indic script (here devanagari).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s certainly true that Chinese, for example, doesn&rsquo;t have x-height, ascenders, or descenders.</p>
<p>Some Indic scripts have a&hellip; vertical structure&hellip; as well, but it is different from that of the Latin alphabet, and Cyrillic, Greek, or even Armenian. Armenian is slightly different, in that the baseline of capital letters is below that of letters within the x-height for the traditional faces.</p>
<p>Hebrew is treated as an all-caps face - and Quoph, at least, has a descender, which somewhat justifies that, but even it is outside the Western paradigm.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, though, the Latin alphabet is usually thought of as the paradigm of simplicity among scripts. Here, it seems to be the most complex.</p>
<p>In any event, it makes sense that printers, trying to print texts in the Latin alphabet, would deal with how to fit its letters on type - and leave other scripts for later. Yes, it&rsquo;s Western-centric, but what would you expect of Westerners? In the case of Chinese - one slaps the character on a type slug&hellip; they&rsquo;re all aligned the same way. So there is no separate body of complexity that needs to be reconciled with Latin-alphabet practice with careful thought - Chinese faces can just be treated as titling faces.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Quadi: Back in the days of foundry metal type, when printers made fonts, they simply designed other-language fonts to fit on the body size, just like everything else. Except in alignment—which was a late innovation in the metal type days, from the end of the 19th century—there was neither need nor attempt to apply these Western concepts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>And now, with TrueType and OpenType, there <em>is</em> a need to say, for a font of Chinese characters, that aligning different faces by the baseline - the default for Latin alphabet faces - should <strong>not be done</strong> if the face is mixed with a Latin face, as opposed to its own Latin-alphabet characters being used.</p>
<p>That could cause problems. So what was not a problem in the days of metal type has become one, since digital fonts are designed around the Latin paradigm.</p>
