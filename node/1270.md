  <BR> <BR>I found this font in my favourite magazine, The Rodder&#39;s Journal. As
  I have a thing for nice retro-ish script fonts I got curious of its origins. Anyone
  out there who recognize this baby?  <BR>Thanks in advance

    these lines. Look for Rocket, Streamline and Raceway. Leslie Cabarga &#40;of flashfonts.com&#41;
    did an amazing job with all three of these. '

  body: Stuart Sandler&#39;s Permanent Waves is also similar, though not it. Find
    his work at <a href="http://www.fontdiner.com" target="_blank">www.fontdiner.com</a>.

    a while. i&#39;ll look for that later. <BR> <BR>however, the style is common -
    e.g. Vox Pop, Glossy Script...... <BR> <BR> <BR>David Hamuel

  body: Hehe, I actually visited the fontdiner site in my search for this font knowing
    that Stuart has made some nice script fonts &#40;Permanent Waves, Cocktail etc.&#41;.
    However, I never bothered checking the free downloads department. <BR> <BR>In
    my mind, I didn&#39;t see this as a font as one that a type creator wanted to
    give away for free.  <BR> <BR>Thanks Stuart, and thanks to all of you who helped
    me here!
