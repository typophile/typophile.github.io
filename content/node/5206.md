body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>I have a font which is condensed and want to create an extended
  out of it. Is there anyone that could help me out with a solid way on how to do
  this best? <BR>I think just scaling it doesn&#39;t do it, because the verticals
  become wider, making the font heavier. Any other suggestions besides redrawing the
  font by hand ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>

    <BR>I recall testing it once, and it didn&#39;t come out very well. A lot of tweaking
    is necessary, so maybe doing it all by &#39;hand&#39; from the beginning is not
    such a bad idea. <BR>

    version you&#39;d have to end up with wider vertical strokes. I don&#39;t think
    there&#39;s an easy way to do this. <BR> <BR>What you could try it scaling it,
    then even out the differences between the horizonatal and vertical strokes by
    hand - ie the horizontals would become heavier, and the verticals lighter. <BR>
    <BR>If you want to try some scaling effect, for characters with simple counters
    &#40;&#34;O&#34;&#41; that might mean scaling horizontally the whole character,
    then scaling the counter &#34;down&#34; vertically and &#34;up&#34; horizontally
    &#40;ie 95% &#42; 105%&#41;.'

  body: '&#62; try combining the scaling with a lopsided &#40;horizontal-only&#41;  <BR>&#62;
    &#34;automatic&#34; weight reduction of the stems  <BR> <BR>I have tried this
    a few times and find that there is still so much cleanup afterward that it is
    of little use.  The best use of this technique for me was to put the resulting
    stretched glyph on the mask layer and use it as a rough guide.  Then copy pieces
    of your orginal font &#40;mostly the joins&#41; and position them over the joins
    on the stretched mask.  You then have to draw new connecting lines or curves.  I
    realize this is no big time saver but designing type isn&#39;t really ever a fast-food
    kind of experience.  My advice is to just roll up your sleeves and do the work.  What
    you gain in experience from doing it will only help you later.  In type design,
    it is about the work so just enjoy it.'
