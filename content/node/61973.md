body: "Hi, everyone. I need your critique on my new script type. Since I am Japanese
  and have never designed a script type, I don't know if it's aesthetically good or
  bad. There is certain amount of alternates and ligatures, I did not post those images
  though.\r\nAlthough this was supposed to be a display type,but one part I think
  that is cool is the shortened lowercases to avoid clashing the descender from upper
  line (see 'Alternate' section). I think it works nicely, but how do you feel?\r\nAnyway,
  tell me anything you felt. I really like to know.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pic2_5064.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pic1_4799.gif]"

  body: "I like it very much. The ascenders reminds me of Zapfino.\r\nI find the alternates
    clever and surely they improve legibility.\r\n(but to find out if they improve
    readability too, it would be necessary to see a non-lipsum text)\r\n\r\nKeep up
    the good work!"

  body: "I hoped someone more expert than me could step forward.\r\nAnyway, here are
    my thoughts:\r\n1. You should revise spacing and kerning. The letters appears
    too tight and crowded.\r\nFurthermore, even if this is an unconnected script,
    the letters\u2019 flow should to some extent follow the one of cursive handwriting.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/american_5076.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/cursive_5970.png]\r\n[cursive

    accent."

    advice.\r\nI reset kerning and redesigned character design according to riccard0's
    advice. Thank you very much.\r\nNow it has wider spacing and natural flow (If
    you look at the word American, you'll see the difference).\r\nHowever, I did not
    want to redesign the i dot.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Tangerine_5585.gif]"

  body: "Looks very nice. Some beautiful letters.\r\nI'm unsure about the /r/ in \"rather\"\r\nYou
    may want to vary the ascender shapes a bit more - see the repetitiveness of \"lack
    of tidal heating\"\r\nWould you consider giving a little more weight to the i/j
    dot (maybe just towards one end of it)?"

  body: "Thank you eliason.\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure that strange looking small r variation
    is not my invention, but I learned it in calligraphy class.\r\n\r\nAll right,
    it looks like everyone is feeling odd about i. Actually I also do a bit (I felt
    that i is leaning too much).\r\nI redesigned not only dot but stem too. Obviously
    this change was adapted to every ligature including i.\r\n\r\nIn order to vary
    ascender characters, first l of ll ligature is shortened and d is very slightly
    shortend as well.\r\nOverall, I exepct designers to utilize Opentype feature as
    I already prepare several variation for each asending characters.\r\nEach of them
    has at least three other variations with the exeption of f.\r\nRight now, if the
    ascenders or descenders of f crashes, there is no way to avoid it.\r\nI think
    f should be made shorter from the very start so that it does not crash.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Newer-Tangerine_4211.gif]"

    you previous post, and noticed that bl should be similarily ligatured also.\r\n\r\nBut
    you should consider that i; it's just confucing with all European languages with
    accented glyphs. You don't have to use a round dot, use stem width.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/th_6368.gif]"

  body: "Also, I understand that that type of tittle (i dot) is typical (and almost
    logical) of some style of script.* But it really is at least distracting and unpractical
    if one would want to use the typeface for setting a number of european languages.
    However, you could create two version of i (to use in different stylistic sets).\r\n\r\n*

    despite practical problem. This is probably unquestionable, but which one should
    be the standard if you would contain both?\r\n\r\nAlso, I added f alternates thanks
    to riccard0's clever idea (Thank you very much!). I think these characters solve
    not olny the problem formerly mentioned (middle row), but others like the crash
    of gf or pf (bottom row) which seemed to be unsolved.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tangerine-March7_5564.gif]"

    does not improve so much (probably because I am careless, or it can be much better).
    How do you feel?\r\nI think there is nothing wrong if i dot does not looks like
    acute. Is there any other accent that might be confused with?"
