  gave me the \"Haas Unica\" typeface to study, but i can't really find a lot of informations
  about it. I've only found the promotionnal publication from the 80's on flickr and
  that it has been used in a stadium in Berlin.\r\n\r\nI would like to know a bit
  more about it, like what is exactly the Team 77, why did they worked together on
  that 'Haas Unica\" typeface, what are they working on now, if they're still working
  together and in which context has been used that \"lost\" typeface...\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAlex "
