  traditional ligature pairs (fi, fl, ff, and so on) do not look that bad without
  the ligature, so I wonder if it's always necessary to make them or not. Also, is
  there like a standard for defining when a ligature is necessary or not?? It may
  be that what looks acceptable to me may look like a total abomination to someone
  else, so I'd like to play safe.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I think the ligatures were an attempt to solve the problems caused by the
    shape of the letter f. So if your pairs "do not look that bad" without the ligature,
    or if the ligatures would look worse than these pairs - I wouldn't make them...
    Anyway, some typefaces have ligatures fi,fl, of the same width as f i, f l (so
    it is not a sort of design necessity but rather a nod to tradition). Some other
    have ligatures that look much worse (introduce much more chaos into spacing) than
    the components... I am always in debt, thinking of, and testing ligatures.

  body: "Hi froo, thanks for your comment.\r\nYou are right when you mention that
    ligatures where created to solve problems with lc f, and in my case, as I already
    mentioned, I don't see that many problems \"yet\".\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot
    of how the pairs ff and ffl currently look like in my font. ff looks good to me,
    ffl is needing some tightening, specially the fl pair that has too much air. Of
    course I could make tracking tighter, but I don't know yet, that's why some other
    typographer's opinions are valuable to me )\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    ligatures. It\u2019s somewhat backwards-compatible: Some users may employ hard-coded
    ligatures in their text. I\u2019m not sure how necessary it is these days though."

    the characters joining you could make the first f crossbar slightly shorter or
    maybe lop off/reduce the lefthand bar on the second f.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: To my eye is is not so much the 'air' but the visual tension created when
    the terminals almost touch. In that respect, your sample could use a lot of improvement
    that may be provided by ligating those pairs.

  body: I totally agree with you Luma, f along with long ascender letters are the
    ligatures that NEED to be present on my font. ff and others, I-m still evaluating.

  body: Introducing ligatures would be an improvement here. Without ligatures, you
    would need to change the shape of the f.
