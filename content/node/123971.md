  body: "The sample you just posted is set in Arial, not Helvetica (which is a match
    to the first sample). \r\n\r\nThe two typefaces are very similar, but not the
    same. See the difference (especially evident in the |1|)?:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Helvetica_4462.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Arial_6474.png]"

  body: "Thanks for the clarification.\r\nI am using \"Helvetica Neue Light\" now.
    I think the numbers are pretty similar but the alphabets \"A Sliding Puzzle\"
    still looks different (Notice the 'z'). \r\nI am sorry I am quite a newbie when
    it comes to dealing with fonts.\r\nOriginal:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Original_4592.png]\r\n\r\nMy
    version:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Recreate_3967.png]\r\n\r\nPlease
    advise."

    there something that I am doing wrong?"

  body: Never mind please ignore my last comment. It didn't apply the Helvetica Neue
    Roman. I have got to download the font first.
