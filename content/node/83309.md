  in the process of designing a few logo's as a company is building me a website as
  a portal with a few distinct business' steaming from it, I'd like to have each one
  having its own identity.\r\n\r\nI am self taught and therefore not the polished
  article. I would just like to court the expertise of a number of professional eyes.\r\n
  \r\nHere are two of the companies and various logo's I've been playing with, I would
  really appreciate it if you'd maybe pass a critical eye over them and make some
  suggestions with respect to the design or colour schemes.\r\n\r\nI would really
  appreciate some input, critique, warnings or suggestions to carry me forward. Feel
  free to post whatever, I have a thick skin.\r\n\r\nThe first is ScotBath DIRECT,
  taps, showers, bathroom suites, towel radiators, etc.\r\n\r\nThe idea is its a stylised
  Saltire (Scottish National Flag), I tried to introduce the waves (evoking water)
  with the flag (as if it was blowing in the wind with folds) but still reasonably
  geometrical and regimented.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://s1208.photobucket.com/albums/cc365/scameron77/Scottish-Home/?action=view&amp;current=ScotBathLogo.jpg\"

  I have tended towards a script font in this one as they naturally seem to lend themselves
  to this business, however I am open to alternatives as discussed.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://s1208.photobucket.com/albums/cc365/scameron77/Scottish-Home/?action=view&amp;current=QGardensLogo-1.jpg\"

    versions, I'd suggest you pick your favorite version and post it once in color
    and once in black and white.\r\n\r\n> Feel free to post whatever, I have a thick
    skin.\r\n\r\nAnd yet you posted a sarcastic response to Dunwich Type. Granted
    his post was rather blunt, but still that's not the best way to encourage others
    to help you out."

  body: Thanks for the input, however in my defence, he instigated the lowering of
    the tone with the partonising response. I can take criticism, however when there
    is no substance to it it doesn't add to the debate.

  body: "> he instigated the lowering of the tone\r\n\r\nAnyone who posts here will
    hear negative comments sometimes, along with comments that they might feel are
    unhelpful. Especially if your designs are \"not polished\" as you said yourself.
    \r\n\r\nMy advise would be to keep the tone friendly even if you don't like some
    of the responses."

  body: "An easy way to separate the amateurs from the professionals* is to gauge
    their reaction to criticism. You admit you are amateur, so I don't think we can
    fault you for that reaction to James' comment. But note that it wasn't particular
    mean. Just blunt. As professionals, most of us** much prefer honest and blunt
    critique over sugar coated half-assed praises disguised as critique.\r\n\r\nSo,
    point being, welcome to your first lesson on receiving critiques: Don't take them
    personally...it's a comment on the work, not you as a person.\r\n\r\nAlso, IMHO,
    I find the best design solution isn't always apparent in a vacuum. Often just
    one little idea from a critique can take the project into a whole other (and better)
    direction. \r\n\r\nThat out of the way, I have to second JamesM...no need to post
    36 copies of one logo. Post one, and let us focus on that.\r\n\r\nTo offer some
    hopefully useful feedback, the first thing that jumps out at me on all your logos
    is the double-outline. It's very jarring and adds nothing but complexity to the
    forms. I suggest as a start that you strip out all of the outlines.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    explore a bit more. Do some sketching. Play with some type. A big part of logo
    design is brainstorming ideas and exploring them to see where they take you. Figure
    for every hour of drawing the logo there are 5-10 hours of sketches and brainstorms.\r\n\r\n*
    Granted, in this industry, even some of our celebrity designers can be thin skinned
    Prima Donnas. \r\n\r\n** OK, maybe I'm wishful thinking there. I *hope* most of
    us, as professionals, prefer the honest, even if blunt, critiques over the \"well,
    that's pretty good...\" fluff. "

  body: "Also, take a few hours and browse through the logo critique section of the
    forums:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/forum/23\r\n\r\nThere's been some amazing
    back-and-forth critique/rework processes in there over the years that are a lot
    of fun to read and watch as a logo morphs from the initial idea into something
    quite often different but wonderful. You'll also get a feel for how a designer
    uses the critiques and doesn't necessarily implement suggestions verbatim but
    uses them as a point of departure for that next round of ideation. "

  body: "Welcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\nIf you want your work critiqued, put it in the
    appropriate place:\r\nHome \xBB Forums \xBB Critique \xBB Logos / Corporate ID
    Design\r\n(Seeking an 'appraisal' is odd. Fishing for compliments won't make a
    design better.)\r\n\r\nUpload images that aren't too wide for Typophile. I think
    580 pixels is the max...\r\n\r\nDon't post low quality JPEGs that are CMYK. In
    my browser (Safari 5 on OS X) the images appear with wildly incorrect color (the
    whites are black, the greens are purple) because you didn't save them properly.
    I had to open the images in Photoshop to see the correct color, and then I saw
    blurry, aliased images.\r\n\r\nNone of the ScotBath variations suggest the Scottish
    Saltire to me. I am American, don't know the history of heraldry, but a quick
    Google search shows me that a green saltire isn't really Scottish. So why have
    the logo be in green if you want it to evoke the flag of Scotland? Blue on teal
    is unreadable.\r\n\r\nI don't see the diagonal/cross of the flag in your waves.
    At best it makes the overall shape look woven, but it doesn't do what you want
    it to. It doesn't communicate water or flag to me.\r\n\r\nThe type choices are
    lame. Both are boring. Like aluminum says, keep exploring.\r\n\r\nThis all needs
    more refinement. You want help to \"carry [you] forward\" and part of that is
    getting honest critiques. I think Typophile can be an immensely rewarding community
    if you take the time to read and research all the information posted throughout
    the site. Take a look at the Typowiki and Resources link at the top. Lurk before
    you post. \r\n\r\nAll of that said, I look forward to seeing your next iteration.\r\n\r\n(No
    comments on Q Gardens, because it is easier to critique it separately. Don't force
    two topics into the same thread)"

  body: ">  JPEGs that are CMYK\r\n\r\nI meant to mention that also; I had to switch
    browsers to view them properly. You might try using Photoshop's \"save for web\"
    feature (File > Save for Web and Devices) when preparing a graphic to post. It
    saves a copy of your graphic as a 72 dpi RGB JPEG that has a much smaller file
    size than the original; perfect for posting on the web. Once you learn how to
    use it, it's a quick and easy way to make JPEGs to post. \r\n\r\n> I don't think
    we can fault you for that reaction to James' comment\r\n\r\nAs a newcomer you
    might not know he's referring to Dunwich Type, who like me is named James. :)"
