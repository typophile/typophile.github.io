body: I have seen this particular font used by only two people so far. Claudia Klat
  uses it brilliantly is the Image attached and in the latest and hopefully not last
  issue of Grakik on pg. 37 far left middle image the great James Langdon uses it
  on a spread reading "Less Order More Chaos". I have only seen it used in all Caps.
  If anyone has some input I would love to crack this one.

    their diploma project in visual communication at the ZHdK last year. So far, only
    the upper case has been drawn and the font is not yet commercially available.
