body: Hey Typophilistines <BR> <BR>i am producing a poster in Icelandic language  and
  they have the characters  ETH and THORN and so forth.. <BR> <BR>and i am using Mac
  OSX Jaguar <BR> <BR>so...   i opened the font i want to use &#40;clarendon&#41;
  in Fontlab and i can see the characters i need...  and also i can extract them to
  an .EPS  but i don&#39;t want to glue the letters into their places one by one...
  using a gridline..  too many signs..  too much hardcorework... <BR> <BR>i cannot
  see them in OS 9 Fontviewer application..   i forget the English name for it..  but
  you know what i mean... in the Applemenu to the left on top of the Chooser...  well
  i can axually see something..  but it is all greeky and pixled like a pickled herring...
  <BR> <BR>and with Clarendon...  Fontlab tells me the number is 217 for &#34;eth&#34;
  <BR>so i tried ALT &#43; 217 <BR>but all i get is the numbers 217 <BR> <BR> <BR>HELP
  is wanted...    Yves are you the MAN???!!!!

    only work under Windows &#40;and perhaps some &#42;nix systems&#41;. Fontographer
    maps these characters to certain control keys: Eth=Ctrl-a; eth=Ctrl-b; Thorn=Ctrl-k;
    thorn=Ctrl=l. The problem is that these keystrokes map to other keyboard controls
    like backspace and page scroll. You can use the Insert Glyphs palette in InDesign
    to plop these characters into your document without resorting to importing .eps
    files. What if you used Fontlab to remap those characters to some other glyph
    position occupied by other, seldom used characters?'

  body: THANX  Grant.. <BR> <BR>smashing idea...  i was too blind and fed up to even
    think! <BR>i shall use InDesign.. <BR>i was working with the text in Ilustrator..  and
    we all know how swell Illustrator handles fonts  &#40;NOT&#41; <BR> <BR>but..
    <BR>is there any other way in OSX jaguar to view fonts..   Font Agent Orange does
    not show all hidden characters? <BR> <BR>

    font i like and it shows the correct letters...  &#40;however i cannot understand
    what it says&#41; but i shall overcome....      again... <BR> <BR> <BR>and i reckon

    kind of buggy....   perhaps it is better now?   <BR> <BR>do you use it? <BR> <BR>
    <BR>well...  Panther seems to be the solution to the font intermezzo in OSX...

  body: I&#39;ve used it on and off from System 7 through OS X - it definitely seems
    to have grown up a lot lately. I have a friend who swears by it.

  body: The other way to get &#34;hidden&#34; characters in OS X is to activate the
    Character Palette. Go to System Prefs, International. Click on the Input Menu
    tab and select Character Palette. You&#39;ll get a small menu after &#34;Help&#34;
    that lets you select and insert any character you want. <BR> <BR>The default is
    Lucida Grande, but if you click the triangle at the bottom you see the glyph in
    other fonts.
