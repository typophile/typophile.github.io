body: Can we make the rounds and have everyone post their favorite ampersands?  Im
  really curious as to which faces have more quirky and expressive ones, and im sure
  most of you know a few gems out there... As for me, im still stuck on Scala. The
  whole way it doesnt connect is just so...sexy...mm.

  body: Here&#39;s an example of the Mother of All Ampersands.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/8253.jpg"
    alt="Tironian et sign &#40;agus&#41;">  <BR>This is the Tironian <i>et</i> sign,
    which is still used today in Gaelic text &#40;it is known in Irish as <i>agus</i>&#41;.
    This sign derives from the Roman judicial shorthand system developed by Marcus
    Tullius Tiro, Cicero&#39;s scribe and namesake of a certain type foundry. The
    top of the Tironian ampersand is aligned to the x-height. Sometimes it descends
    below the baseline, looking like -- sometimes too much like -- an oldstyle number
    seven; in other examples it stops at the baseline. All Gaelic fonts should contain
    this characters. Note that it has its own Unicode codepoint, U&#43;204A, to distinguish
    it from the usual ampersand, because it is sometimes found in texts used alongside
    the modern form.

  body: Him, hope I can translate it right. This site is a school project of a christian
    monk monastery. <BR> <BR>The letters and ligatures derived from historical hand
    written sources and help to read and decode the old latin scripts from the library.
    <BR> <BR>The project was inspired by same samples from a book restorage. In the
    upcoming time of letter print, most of the original scripts used or cuted to repair
    the &#34;new&#34; and &#34;better&#34; printed books. Nowadays some of such historical
    samples will be found in such early printed books if they will be restored again.
    <BR> <BR>Like yesterday or so, some new unknown samples of the &#34;hildebrands
    lied&#34; are found in an Austrian monastery. <BR> <BR>So, these samples are for
    historical research only and not samples for new fonts designs. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Back
    to the topic - It`s interesting to see such historical forms.
