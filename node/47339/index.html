  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I really enjoy spending time in here, educating my self with the knowledge and guidance from you guys. I have used many hours reading threads and replies, and commented a few my self.

I have made web design all of my life, starting 10-years old. First in 2000 I tried Photoshop, soon to be followed by all the other Adobe products. It was here I started my passion for corporate ID design.

<strong>1. Magventure</strong>
	Magnetic stimulation.

<strong>2. Advanseed</strong>
	Sells special seeds like Rucula.

<strong>3. Regnskabets time</strong>
	Auditor. The name is on Danish and is a saying like, "The 11th hour" but with a more threatening meaning. Like "Let's settle the score" sort of. It meant to be humorous.

<strong>4. Kongens Lyngby haveservice</strong>
	"Kongens Lyngby" is a city in Denmark. A part of Lyngby. Translated to English it would be: "The Kings Lyngby". "Haveservice" means "Garden Service". So "The Kings Lyngby Garden Service".

<strong>5. Daren</strong>
	Darén is a cleaning business. The idea was that the white stuff is like when you sweep.

<strong>6. InOffice</strong>
	Office hotel in Copenhagen.

<strong>7. Advanseed</strong>
	Sells special seeds like Rucula.

<strong>8. AktieFokus</strong>

<strong>9. Giantmedia</strong>
	An advertising agency.

<strong>10. Intramedia</strong>
	A CMS IT comany

I don't know why i post it - it's way too late to change any of them... well ... maby just because we all love logos... :-)

Please be free to say your opinion, whether it's good or bad... :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some of them are very nice logos, others aren't. It's always easier to criticise. :) So. 

I don't think that INOffice is a good one. It needs quite a bit of work, but it's a good start.

Daren total is looks nice and ok but I don't think that's a corporate logo. At least not for cleaning business.

Especially I like the tree/crown logo. I would change it a bit to make crown and tree work as single image, because they look as two images at the moment, but it's very nice and memorable. I hope wherever it's used it has enough breathing space around. it's the best one of all these.

Other logos/images are quite web2-ish...
