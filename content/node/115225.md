body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_3710.png]\r\n\r\nI used this in a
  logo 7 years ago and no longer have the files. The client needs some more work.
  Any help in identifying this would be much appreciated. The \"E\" and \"S\" are
  giveaways...\r\n\r\nUsed in this logo:\r\n\r\nwww.agiasophiacoffeeshop.com"

    being said it is proably more than just based on Trajan\r\n\r\nOpening the font
    in FontLab it says it is modified \"Trajax\" which is another clone of Trajan"

  body: OK, got it. I could only relay exactly what Bob said. Be careful with this
    one as some (many) letters have been ripped from Trajan or simply slightly edited.
