    new wood type using some old and new techniques, he might have some ideas. Does
    anyone remember who that was?

    did a project using 3d rendering software and a CNC router to make "wood type"
    out of linoleum for a school project. <a href="http://www.nicksherman.com/design/Intercut/"

  body: Are you trying to make moveable type? you can have an engraver make a magnesium
    block with large 60pt+ letters and cut them up. Those blocks can be printed letterpress.
    Of course, you can also make these out of wood. http://www.pellaengraving.com/  I
    use these people to make type-high magnesium blocks. Do you want the wood type
    for some utilitarian purpose? or for posterity?

  body: Sandblasted wood signs are surprisingly easy to make as well as visually interesting.
    The materials are expensive, but the clients want it. However the soft wood often
    used for signs (clear heart redwood, or HD urethane foam) is not really suitable
    for print use.

  body: "Yes, that was indeed me who presented at TypeCon in 2007. I did do some cuts
    in wood, but used linoleum for my final production material in order to save money
    and time... I wasn't working with any grants or anything, and properly prepared
    end-grain maple can be expensive / hard to come by / slow to cut.\r\n\r\nI have
    been seeing more and more student projects like my own since then, many of them
    using lasers. The laser method seems very nice, but depending on the machine used,
    and under which settings, you will often get a slight amount of stair-stepping
    due to limited resolution. It can also char up the shoulder (again, depending
    on the machine), which can be tricky if you don't like the idea of getting soot
    in your ink.\r\n\r\nIt's still in very early stages (in fact, it was only made
    public last week), but I recently started a blog to report on such things related
    to wood type: <a href=http://www.woodtyper.com>Woodtyper.com</a>\r\n\r\nI have
    some other ideas I'd like to explore about how to most easily and efficiently
    produce large printing type with modern machinery, and I'll surely be discussing
    them there in the future. I'll also be reporting on projects being done by other
    people, as well as events, books, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to be at TypeCon
    next week, there will be a presentation by Craig Malmrose about his experiments
    in making wood type. If not, I believe we'll be doing a joint report on his work
    later on Woodtyper.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, are you considering cutting some
    type yourself?"

    turn a golf ball. Works great on a CNC router table. Downside is that it is porous.
    Sealing it is going to be a problem. CNC routers are also very useful of carving
    hardwoods. Sand blasting will also work on these materials. \r\n\r\nIn any case,
    due to the limitations of blasting and CNC routing, your letters are not going

    as deeper it has to be.\r\nIt will be printed in letterpress. Imagine a paper
    where a P shall be printed to. If it is, let's say, 20 Cicero (90 mm) large, there
    is a risk that the paper flapps to the bottom of the P and gets into contact with
    the wood material. If this gets contact to the rollers, too, it does not work.
    - So... anything between 1,5 mm (48 p size) and 2,5 mm (20 Cicero)?\r\n\r\nThe
    Museum f\xFCr Arbeit (Museum of Work) in Hamburg, Germany, ist testing this technique

    Because it needs up to 30 min. to produce a letter. So, if you produce a font
    (which includes more than only one characterset, but two of it as a minimum)),
    you have to calculate a real high price for it. And there are not enough buyers...\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch

    ones). We own one of these machines to produce cliches up to approx. DIN A4.\r\n\r\nAnd
    we already thought about a plastic, like - but of course not the same - Berthold
    did in the 70ies:\r\nhttp://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=58&idart=848\r\n\r\nIt's
    a fact that it prints a better quality and much more cleaner than wood types.
    And it is cheaper. But would it be the same? The charming of wood letter prints
    would have be gone, I think. And a replication would - in my opinion - be a little
    bit like Disney World, its not the original.\r\n\r\nBut yes, I agree. It could
    be a way. \r\nNow the \"only and last problem\" would be to find a market.\r\nA
    font of 20 Cicero (90 mm) would be at around 600-700 Euro - just calculated be
    heart. Who would be willing and able to pay it in the letterpress scene?\r\nWe
    offer simple Grotesk fonts for approx. 250 Euro:\r\nhttp://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=69&rubrik=Holzlettern&unterrubrik=&maxday_in=19990716&article_id=1929\r\n\r\nand
    sometimes we have to wait a year or so, until its sold.\r\nI am sure, to develop
    this kind of production, we could get help from the Museum Of Work in Hamburg,
    Germany. So it would not be too expensive.\r\nAnd I am sure its possible without
    problems, to find a font developer, who is interested to see his font produced
    in our way.\r\n\r\nAnd - last but not least - it would make a lot of fun, right?!\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch
