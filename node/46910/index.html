<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Whenever I go downtown, to the cbd actually, I tend to get overwhelmed by the crowds, the traffic, and the impending sense of doom that generally comes along with visiting the crime capital of the United States. Over the past week, however, I've made it a point to head out there for some daytime visits. I approached my adventures more as a tourist rather than a native, attempting to throw out all previous knowledge that swirls in my head when considering even venturing there. By clearing my head and becoming and observer I noticed many different things about my city that I had not noticed before.
The architecture and design that embodies the majority of buildings of the cbd is astounding. Taking the time to notice the detail in the old fonts, the small pieces of art work that decorate the walls, and the fine attention to detail is reminiscent of a time when people actually cared enough about their craft to include the fine details. Also, I noticed the new commisioned pieces for the street car (you should definetly check them out, they're all over the place. I think that it's the same person that did the fish project.) Anyway, from my visit, downtown gained a little more respect from me...
It was, however, a disappointing feeling in the aspect that people have lost a sense of beauty in design.. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Louie you are right about people losing the sense of beauty in design. It seems people only tend to care about the money that they are getting paid for the work and not the beauty of creating something. I really do like the streetcars that they have throughout the city and I do believe that the same person who did the fish did the streetcars as well. I just hope that the streetcar that the 2008 senior class of Loyola has an awesome street car just like the rest of the ones in the city. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Louie,
I wish you had taken some photos of what you were looking at in the CBD. I am sure people who have never been to this area and may never go would like to see the fine details and craft that seems to be dying as technology advances. Christilisa is right that most people are too busy to slow down and hire someone to make something long lasting and beautiful. Remember this when you are designing your next project. Take time for the small details.
Also, if either of you are interested in helping with the design of the 2008 senior class street car at Loyola, let me know! I have been bombarded with emails by the head director of this project. They are desperately looking for some good designs. How about a typographic street car? Let me know if you are interested!</div>
