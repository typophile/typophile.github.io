  nature every character doesn't 100% respect overshoot limits.\r\n\r\nMy question
  is: how the alignment values should be? Should they fit the overshoot despite the
  characters sometimes surpass them here and there OR should the alignment values
  have as limit the characters with the more extreme nodes? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nRamiro.\r\n\r\n"

    small sizes and low resolutions, and which features are you happy to let pop up
    and down a pixel at some sizes? Features that you want to be aligned need to be
    within the same blue zone.\r\n\r\nNote that if you do end up making large blue
    zones in order to accomodate the widely ranging height, you may need to adjust
    the size of the BlueScale value. <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/42173?\">See
    here for more information on correct calculation of BlueScale.</a>"
