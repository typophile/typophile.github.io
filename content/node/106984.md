  body: My apologies, Ryuk. When I checked under "My Posts," it said I had no posts,
    so I thought my original post was no longer in the forum. So, I posted again.
    When I decided to manually look through the old pages to see if my original post
    was there, I spotted it with your response. Thanks for your detailed feedback.
    I see my font is indeed similar to LHF Gunslinger Good, although the left vertical
    for the capital "A" in my font is the one that's thicker, whereas it is the right
    vertical for the capital "A" that's thicker in Gunslinger Good. I suppose I could
    just "flip" the Gunslinger Good capital "A" along the vertical axis. It also seems
    there is more difference between the "thicker" verticals and the "thinner" verticals
    in my font for the capital "A", "W", and "Y" than the same letters in Gunslinger
    Good.
