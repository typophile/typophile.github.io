body: "I'm a newbie in typography. Recently I found that almost all the fonts in my
  computer occur kerning problem of the numbers containing \"1\", such as \"512\",
  \"21\", \"31\", etc. Those fonts from Bitstream especially need manual kerning,
  and those from Adobe need less.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering whether the problem of number
  is a universal problem in typography nowadays. I'm using a Windows XP system and
  Illustrator CS on a PC. Any help and suggestion are welcomed.\r\n\r\nThanks ahead."

    fonts may have alternate proportional numerals which you can easily access via
    formatting - use the OpenType palette. You can even change your default text setting
    for new docs to automatically use proportional numbers (your choice of lining
    or oldstyle).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    in the case that I haven't got an opentype face with proportional figures.\r\n\r\n:)"
