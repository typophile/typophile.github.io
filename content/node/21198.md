  been interning for this summer, and I was asked to create a document (\"template\")
  for her that should could easily edit text in.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to unlink text
  frames from a text thread without deleting their contents or having to reformat
  the rest of the thread--all I want is each text box to stay in their own respective
  spot. Is this an impossibility, or am I missing something? \r\nThanks!"

      a friend who is. I will look into it, thank you

  body: If it's not a huge document with a lot of text frames you could start from
    the end, first copy and then delete the text in the frame, then unlink the frame
    (double click in port). After unlinking paste the text back into the frame. Repeat
    with every frame working your way from end to start.

    don't need to. It's _very_ simple to use them. You just have to download the scripts
    and place them in [InDesign folder]/Presets/Scripts/. Then it\u2019s just a matter
    of bringing up the \u2018Scripts\u2019 palette (Window->Automation->Scripts) and
    start double-clicking. How difficult is that?  ;^)"
