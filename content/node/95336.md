  for use on the cover of a fantasy novel? \r\n\r\nMy biggest, perhaps only, complaint
  with Mantinia is how heavy it appears at larger sizes\u2014especially when it comes
  down to flowing nicely, not being in competition, with the imagery of a fantasy
  novel's cover. The current interior typeface is Minion Pro. A titling face that
  pairs well with Minion Pro would be a big plus. However, I do not know if that is
  the finalized interior face, so it is not an absolute necessity.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I
  love the ligatures, so a typeface with an assortment of ligatures is a must. \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>An
  alternate capital R with an extended leg is preferred\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>A Renaissance-era
  revival seems to be the best choice, so I would like to find something in that overall
  family. \r\n<li>More than one optical weight would be a big bonus as well. \r\n</ul>\r\nI
  know it's being rather specific, but does anyone have any suggestions?"

    is the "flat" ends of the serifs.
