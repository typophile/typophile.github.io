    FRUSTRA</a> means, 'Except the Lord in Vain'. Apparently a, \"normal heraldic
    contraction of a verse from the 127th Psalm\"\r\n\r\n'Except the Lord build the
    house\r\nThey labour in vain that build it:\r\nExcept the Lord keep the city\r\nThe
    watchman waketh but in vain.'"

  body: "That doesn't work, because \"nisi\" introduces a dependent clause in which
    the tense of the verb (and hence its ending) must change -- note the \"aedificaverit\"
    in the full version. (Subjunctive.)\r\nif you're going to have an abbreviation/contraction
    of the complete text, with the rest of it elided (implied), then why not go with
    the traditional \"Nisi dominus frustra\"?\r\n\r\n"
