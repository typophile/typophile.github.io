  body: There is a &#40; free &#41; font out there, named &#39;Alison&#39;, which
    seems to be similar.. <BR><i>&#40; But, well, again, I am not too sure about the
    &#39;free&#39; part, so, no &#40; direct &#41; link, from me, sorry.. &#41;</i>

  body: Mike, can you chime in and tell us if you know of an available  <BR>&#34;official&#34;
    digitization? Can&#39;t find anything.

  body: Thanks Dav&#40;id&#41; that&#39;s pretty close - maybe close enough <BR> <BR>Also,
    I looked at <a href="http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg5.html" target="_blank">http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg5.html</a>  and
    thought it looked like what Mike calls &#34;AlienScript&#34; at the bottom of
    the page but I haven&#39;t had any luck in finding that one either - It&#39;s
    got a more useable cap G - the one in Andrea / Diana / Alison / whatever you&#39;d
    like to call it is a real shocker! <BR> <BR>Thanks again for your blisteringly
    fast response!

  body: Alison seems to be Dianna &#40;per the Solotype Catalog&#41;/Ballantines with
    a few altered caps. I do like that &#39;A&#39;, though. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a
    good showing of 7 weights of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/ballantines-script/"
    target="_blank"> Ballantines</a>. Elsner &amp; Flake&#39;s <a href="http://www.elsner-flake.com/"
    target="_blank"> website</a> gives credit for these fonts to the Brendel Typestudio,
    1974-78 and copyright to <a href="http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm" target="_blank">
    Quick Brown Fox</a>, where the fonts may be obtained directly for less money.

  body: You&#39;re not going to believe this... <BR>After all of this stuffing around,
    the client wants to change the font to something more formal like Copperplate...
    sheeeesh!!! But thanks for all the help guys... y&#39;know... I could run a really
    good design company if I didn&#39;t have clients!!! ;-&#41;

  body: Sorry, for being late to reply. I was gone from home from Tuesday morning
    until this afternoon. Yves &amp; BJ&#40;Too&#41; and Mike F are all right. I think
    Ballantines is the basis for all of those. <BR> <BR>Sounds like it&#39;s academic
    now ;-&#41;

  body: Mike, thanks a lot for the follow up... and yes it is academic now, but just
    curious as to who sells what you call AlienScript at <a href="http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg5.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg5.html</a>  ? Did a
    search around and all I got was freebie space invaders type stuff. Cheers!
