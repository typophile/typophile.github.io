body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Books]] : Elements of Typographic Style, The</strong>\r\n\r\nBy
  [[Robert Bringhurst]], published by [[Hartley & Marks]]. There are many references
  to typography in English, but there is only one <cite>Elements of Typographic Style</cite>.
  Less a how-to guide, manual, or textbook than a distillation of several hundred
  years' worth of wisdom on the typographer's craft. No less an authority than [[Hermann
  Zapf]] has proclaimed it as a natural candidate to become \"the [[Typographer's
  Bible]]\". It encompasses a list of typographic relations analogous to Strunk &amp;
  White's <cite>Elements of Style</cite>, but goes on to outline the basics of humanist
  book design, and includes a lengthy and valuable overview of classic and useful
  typefaces (which is as revealing for what it omits as well as what it includes).
  It also includes several encyclopedic reference sections of special extended Latin
  and non-Latin characters as well as perhaps the most useful illustrated glossary
  of typographic terms available. While there is much this book will not teach you,
  it is an education in itself, and nearly impossible to overvalue.\r\n\r\n<strong>Comments
  on this Title</strong>\r\n\r\nAnyone relatively new to typography and eager to learn
  needs to have a copy of Bringhurst\u2019s Elements\u2026 I often say about that
  book that I wish I\u2019d never read it, so that I could read it again for the first
  time. It single-handedly exploded my interest in typography. And once you\u2019re
  done with that book, simply hit the bibliography at the back as a guide to other
  books to take a look at.\r\nThe thing with Bringhurst is that he does a very good
  job of outlining what to look for in a font; not just if you \u201Clike\u201D it,
  but what a good font needs to have in its arsenal.\r\n--Jason Dewinetz\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
