body: "Hi,\r\nI have problem to set font height. I have font which looks too big and
  there is lot of space under glyph. I use Fontographer (20090923) to change descent
  without rescale outlines.\r\nBut in Microsoft Word font looks even bigger so I have
  to use smaller size.\r\nOnly way I found to change appearance was setting paragraph
  parameter \"Line spacing\" to \"Exactly\" 8 (beceause I use font size 8 to fit text
  on page).\r\nBut unfortunately behaviour of Microsoft Word is strange in this case.
  Lines are thiner because Line spacing is set exactly 8 and on page rise space to
  accept more lines but Word cannot accept next lines to free space and keep them
  on next page.\r\nPlease How can I change font height to make font smaller and force
  Microsoft Word to use thiner lines?\r\n\r\nThanks for advance"

    outlines, but I agree with oldnick, let's see the Font Info to be sure.

  body: I change size to 1024 Em with Scale Outlines (Ascent 864, Descent 160) but
    I can't see any diffenrence. Microsoft Word has still wide lines and after forcing
    Line spacing to size 8 can't accept next lines in free space. :(
