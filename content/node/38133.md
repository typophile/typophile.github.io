  body: "Hmmm, no response yet. My 2 cents:\r\n\r\nI think the biggest issue I have
    with this typeface is the overuse of your embellishment. It seems forced and unnecessary
    in most places, especially the lowercase. I'd try removing it from all but a few
    lc letters and consider reworking some of the uppercase for a more consistent
    placement."

  body: "I think this is a beautiful display face in the right setting - I'm sure
    there's a great logotype waiting to happen in here! \r\n\r\nI would really like
    to see how it works with some other short pieces of copy - this face is obviously
    more suited to a couple of words at a time, rather than the block of text above...\r\n\r\nGreat
    work, love it!"

  body: Yeah it would be really nice to have a plain version too. So you could mix
    and match the embellishments for longer pieces of copy.
