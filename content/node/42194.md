body: I'd like to buy a t-shirt design from a typographer who knows what they're doing
  because I like fonts, but I never buy font-only shirts at apparel outlets. It's
  usually because their message is not original and the design is not original. Hopefully
  someone in this field of work can come up with a creative shirt to do with kerning,
  lorem ipsum, wingbats, or something that looks like a stylish tee for a typophile.

  body: "Anyone could type up Lorem Ipsum or the alphabet on an American Apparel shirt
    so I'm not going to pay Veer $20 a tee for them.\r\n\r\nI knew I would see some
    helvetica tees, but at least Khoi Vinh\u2019s Hel-Fucking-Vetica has a cool design.
    (not that I'd wear something with that language, but it's still sold out anyways)\r\n\r\nThat
    Ketchup And Mustard t-shirt is headed towards the art direction I like, but it
    looks familiar to me and do all typographers use condiments? ;)\r\nI knew I've
    seen similar designs before.\r\nhttp://www.threadless.com/submission/85700/Lorem_Ipsum_Dolor_Sit_Amet\r\nhttp://www.threadless.com/submission/92057/Lorm_Ipsum_Dolor_Tubes\r\nand
    I like this design better (but I'm not going to wear something that says \"selfless\"
    on it)\r\nhttp://www.threadless.com/submission/73979/Selfless\r\n\r\nedit: After
    searching Threadless I came across what I think is the community's best typography,
    [[http://www.threadless.com/submission/10706/E_type/showmore,designs|\"E\"-type!]]."
