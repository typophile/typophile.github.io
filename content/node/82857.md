  I am designing but I also wanted to use lowercase letters, but Felix Titling only
  has uppercase.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any similar fonts that also have a lowercase?
  Or can anyone recommend any stylised Serif fonts that they like to use for logos?\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/FelixTitling_4815.jpg.gif]"
