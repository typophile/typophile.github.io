body: I&#39;m currently working on designing for a safety product at school, and one
  of the challenges we have is to make sure the instruction text on the product is
  as legible as possible. <BR>So i&#39;ve set out to find a typeface that was designed
  with super legibility in mind, or typefaces that have excelled in legibility testing...
  <BR>google searches and casual asking around school have gotten me nowhere, so i
  was wondering if you guys could offer some pointers? <BR> <BR>thanks... <BR>Svenni

  body: Hey, stop blaming the font! <BR>What would be of more use for legibility would
    be a &#34;shizzolator&#34; that rewrote text to avoid visually ambiguous/difficult
    words.   <BR> <BR>For instance, Clearview has the commonplace &#34;modern/modem&#34;
    problem with the &#34;r-n&#34; combination. A &#34;legibilizer&#34; would replace
    words containing &#34;r-n&#34; with alternates, eg &#34;contemporary&#34; or &#34;up-to-date&#34;
    for &#34;modern&#34;. It would also vary the length of adjacent words, and prefer

    walk with a big red hand and a symbol of a person walking. Maybe the safety instructions
    could be communicated easier using symbols. I think they made the sign change

    of course is that you&#39;re moving closer to an &#34;n&#34;. <BR>The x-height

    <BR>Plus you&#39;re making the &#34;r&#34; wider &#40;see #1 below&#41;. <BR>

    Word width is a key determinant of bouma resolution, and having divergence in
    letter widths &#40;as in narrow &#34;r&#34; versus wide &#34;n&#34;&#41; helps
    a lot. <BR>2&#41; You could just use a kerning pair to achieve a similar &#40;if

    &#40;especially in a sans design&#41; might get too close to a word space. <BR>
    <BR>The great thing about an ascending &#34;r&#34; is that the space between the
    x-line and the ascender height is very poorly used in the Latin alphabet, and
    having a modestly rising beak on the &#34;r&#34; would diverge boumas wonderfully.
    In the same way, it would be great of the &#34;e&#34; had a modest descender.

    be a big, fluorescent numeral &#34;1&#34; on the pin and &#34;2&#34; on the trigger.
    Granted, this might be a problem for people whose languages don&#39;t use Arabic
    numerals, but most of the world at least recognizes them.

    of information to all people in the quickest possible way. Adding the colour simply
    increases the information available to those who are not colour blind. Those who
    are colour blind still have the same amount of information that they have with
    typical fire extinguishers. The written instructions indicate both object &#40;pin,

    to Svenni&#39;s original query: most extinguishers already have instructions printed

    to mount near them. Trying to design your own signs will get you into a <i>huge</i>
    project of trying to figure out federal, state &amp; local regulations, and to
    get approval from same.  Plus, if you live in the US and somebody gets hurt using
    the fire extinguisher, you could open yourself to litigation. &#40;&#34;The instructions

    <BR>... <BR>A narrow face? <BR>I was thinking that because it was a rounded surface,
    the text would need to be slightly wider to stand up to the squeeze? If it is
    narrow, you&#39;ll get more words in one area, but then at the edges, it will
    be really rough to read, and you&#39;ll turn it. But you&#39;re probably right;
    there&#39;d be less turning if there were more words rather than being able to
    read the edges only a little better. <BR>[?] <BR>And actually, this sort of happened
    to me &#40;not the turning, but needing to read directions <i>really</i> carefully
    in a critical situation.&#41;  <BR>The pilot light on my heater went out in the
    middle of the night. The heater is in a closet so the lighting is bad, and since
    it was night, I was already tired, plus with the heater out, I was cold too. I&#39;ve
    always heard stories of people lighting the pilot and having their house blow
    up, so I was also a little nervous.  <BR> <BR>So I open the closet door, and here&#39;s

  body: I had trouble with the flashread, because it shows all words, whether short
    or long, for the same period of time. <BR> <BR>A more sophisticated version would
    also have interactivity for the reader to vary the rate of play. The reader could
    modulate playback speed with a slider or wheel -- which would allow going back
    to check something that was missed. <BR> <BR>Re your point, Hrant, perhaps something
    that was a hybrid of this and a &#34;moving window&#34; that shows parafoveal
    information, would be more efficient. <BR> <BR>Actually, dissolving between frames,
    rather than jump cutting, would be comparable to providing parafoveal info, and
    certainly easier on the eye.
