  body: "If the type below ONE WORLD is not the same as ONE WORLD, then the /Q is
    unknown. As you said, the /Q in Albertan appears different from the sample. \r\nAlbertan
    Pro:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vicu1_6505.jpg] The /O in the words below
    is not fully round like in ONE WORLD and perhaps the /D is narrower also so we
    may be dealing with a different font with very similar characteristics. \r\n\r\nIs
    there another sample available?\r\n"

    I concur with Mr. Pape that OUR WORLD is Albertan, and not the same font as the
    text below it.\r\n\r\nTo echo Riccardo, if you can provide the URL, we can tell
    you definitively (the links are very likely web fonts, and the coding will tell
    us which one)."
