body: "Greetings,\r\nI've been developing this typeface for the past month, and I've
  got to a point where I'm feeling kind of blocked, so I thought it would be a good
  idea to come here for some help. I'm happy with the lowercase, although I'm sure
  you'll find lots of problems with it (problems which I'd be more than happy correcting,
  by the way), the main issue I'm having is with the uppercase; due to its geometric
  construction some letters (E,F,I,T,L,H mainly) aren't quite fitting with the curviness
  of the other ones.\r\nI've made a really quick pdf with the first sentences that
  came to mind (feel free to ask for more material if you need it for a better judgement!),
  and I'd be really glad to hear the criticism of better trained eyes (and hands).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

  body: Well... that's basically what I've been doing, although lately my thoughts
    have gone into forgetting about the uppercase and making it just a lowercase font

  body: "I like it! Some great shapes in there. And I don't see anything essentially
    wrong with it.\r\n\r\nThe caps though need more thought - I think you might be
    trying too hard there. And some of the whitespaces (like between the \"um\") are
    pretty bad - try to break those up.\r\n\r\nSome specifics:\r\n- The top of the
    \"f\" is malformed.\r\n- Maybe the tittles should be flat ovals?\r\n- Try a Koch-style
    \"g\".\r\n- The \"r\" is too stiff.\r\n- The \"t\" is too narrow.\r\n- I don't
    think the \"z\" is in character. Maybe descend it.\r\n- Could you curve the tail
    of the \"Q\" gently <em>downward</em> instead?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks hrant! I'll work on those suggestions and let you see it as soon as
    I'm done!\r\n\r\nI know the uppercase neep a lot of work, and that was the main
    reason I came here... but I'm still a bit lost with them, right now the direction
    that seems best is making them more geometrical, which might make them not that
    cool when using along with the lowercase but can make them look alright amongst
    each other.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks a lot again!"

  body: "so...\r\n\r\nI redid the uppercase, based on a more geometric construction,
    and it turned out better. The only problems are still with the diagonals (VWXY)
    and the way they match their lowercase versions. I've turned some straight angles
    into curves, and it helped a bit, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go\r\n\r\nI've
    adjusted the 't' and the 'f'. I've did a few changes to the 'r', and even made
    an alternate version, but I'm having mixed feelings about it. Also, the koch-style
    'g' turned out great!\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks a lot for the tips!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    letters. Or is that intentional?\r\n\r\nI'm not so fond of the deep cut under
    the ear of the |g|, it looks traumatic. \r\n\r\nI prefer the |r| with the rectangular
    terminal."

    cut.\r\n\r\nThe counters of \"O\"/\"o\" are too small.\r\n\r\nThe UC is much better,
    but it still needs work. And I still worry about the \"Q\" being too stylized.\r\n\r\nThe
    overshoot amount (and some other things too BTW) depends on what point size you're
    shooting for.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
