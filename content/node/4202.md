  body: Kevin, if you want a typeface identified you really  <BR><i>must</i> post
    it on the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/83.html?1081549640"
    target="_blank"> Type Identification Board</a>. It just  <BR>gets lost here in
    General Discussions.

    for it in the &#34;Free Silverware&#34; section.

  body: Apologies to Stuart -- it&#39;s actually called Fontdinerdotcom Loungy, and
    a quick download confirms not only the id &#40;down to the star on the i&#41;,
    but the setting of the sample is practically right out of the box, just adding
    a tiny bit of kerning.

  body: Speaking of free silverware, I had to pay to rent silverware today for our
    seder tomorrow night. Seems like it shouldn&#39;t have cost $1/person just for
    three utensils each, but it did.
