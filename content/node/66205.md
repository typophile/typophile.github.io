body: I am designing the graphic content of a small museum celebrating the Italian
  immigrant contribution to Australian culture. My clients want a very contemporary
  look. I wondered if other typophiles might be able to recommend any recent (post
  Novarese) type design work coming out of Italy that would be appropriate. I need
  display type and a type family for bigger blocks of information. Any assistance
  much appreciated.

    be a little off topic, but being an Italian Melburnian I'm interested in these
    exhibitions; could you tell me where and when the exhibition will be held or better
    still a link to a site with information on the exhibition?"

  body: All the helpful links are much appreciated. I just noticed the new HF&J release
    (Vitesse) which picks up on elements of Eurostile. Re Domenico's post, it is a
    new space being developed within the City of Melbourne -- it will be a permanent
    facility (opening later in 2010?), located in Carlton, but I should be circumspect
    and leave promotion of it to my client.

    the client's request for a contemporary look.\r\n\r\n\"it will be a permanent

    It sounds great, I'll be sure to keep an eye out for it."

  body: "The Eurostile angle of Vitesse seems just the ticket, and I think it might
    even be usable for a moderate amount of text. If you need a separate but matching
    display font, check out Linotype's Morris Sans.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
