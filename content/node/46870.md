  Show \u2013 Eco-Bag / Eco-Life runs from June 26 - July 6, 2008\r\n\r\nArtists from
  around the world were invited to participate in this exhibition and asked to use
  cloth bags as a canvas to express their thoughts about global environmental issues.
  The hand-made eco-bag, Decorated Eco-Bag (aka DECOB) will be shown to international
  audiences in an effort to raise awareness of environmental issues and as a call
  to take active initiatives.\r\n\r\nGreat idea, and some super fine bag designs came
  out of this! The show will be doing some international touring, be sure to check
  it out if it reaches your city. \r\nThis exhibit will travel to the following cities:
  Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong, London and New York.\r\n\r\nAll original works will be
  for sale.\r\n\r\nAlso available limited edition print bags by artist Jade Rude,\r\ntypotherapy

  body: Promoting eco or environmental friendly bag, maybe a little way for us to
    hep save the planet as the component of this type of bag is natural and no harmful
    components that affects the planet. I am also a advocate of this campaign by using
    the eco bag and other alike ideas, in fact I ordered several of eco-bags from
    this site <a href=http://www.kekacase.com/home-decor/keka-travel.html rel=dofollow>http://www.kekacase.com/home-decor/keka-travel.html</a>
    to use for giveaways this coming holiday season.
