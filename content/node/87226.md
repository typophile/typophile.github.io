  body: "I scaled your image down 50%. It might have just been too big to load before.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3beUD_5832.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinitely
    not Art Deco. It's a Victorian style that probably pre-dates the more fluid look
    of Art Nouveau.\r\n\r\nThe spirals made me think of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kismet/|Kismet]],
    but that is rounder, or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/penelope/|Penelope]],
    but that is squarer. If you click on Solotype, in the publisher credit of Penelope,
    you might find something closer. The B looks familiar but I think the rest is
    either modified or 100% custom."

  body: I knew I had seen it somewhere. The font is called Ringel; found it in The
    Quick Brown Fox filmtype catalog. I don't know of a digital version.
