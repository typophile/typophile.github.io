  regulars met up in San Francisco for dinner at <a href=\"http://www.farmerbrown.com\">farmerbrown</a>.
  Tasty food. Good conversation. Thanks to Karen Huang (<a href=\"http://www.snogblog.com\">snogblog</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.manic.com.sg\">Manic</a>) and husband Jimmy for providing a
  good excuse to get together.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the pics are <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joepemberton/sets/72157601927859003/\">on
  Flickr</a>.\r\n\r\n(And thanks Hrant for the heads-up.)\r\n"

  body: "Yes, it was great being there. If anyone of you \u2014 Zara, Stewf, Carl,
    Karen (Parry), Joe (and Jeanie) are ever in Singapore. We'd love to play host
    too! \r\n\r\nEspecially Carl. Cos I really didn't get a chance to talk to you
    much. And you went through the trouble of making the reservations too. Thanks
    for that. We would never have gotten in without reservations.\r\n\r\nStewf, are
    you back in SF yet? \r\n\r\nHehe, and I look like I'm doing something dubious
    with my nose in that photo.\r\n\r\nI wonder if any typophile is coming to Singapore
    anytime soon. Always nice to meet with fellow type lovers. \r\n"

  body: "Hey Zara, we're enjoying SF alright. Jimmy's loving the weather and I'm loving
    the quirky shops and all the chocolates! Yesterday we had the best banh mi at
    the Tenderloin. We walked past the library and the City Hall, and found that it
    wasn't as bad as we expected.\r\n\r\nStewf, my timing's off I guess. Was hoping
    to catch you again but today's my last day in SF. Well, be sure to email me if
    you're going to be in Singapore. Thanks for the goodies!"
