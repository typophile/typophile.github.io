  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys,
I am designing a poster. Here is the link

http://issuu.com/uzapuca/docs/__cartel_iom_-_mar_2015_-_imprenta_

1) I am undecided about which of the two fonts will work better in this project. What do you think?

2) Could you help me out with the kerning? Specially in the very condensed version. The poster is A3 size and the current kerning 60 pt. 

3) On the other hand, i don't know if it is better to open the space between words (in the condesed font) a bit more or not.  


Thanks for all your help and best,
S

I will reduce tracking then. I was kind of worry to reduce it since very condensed font tend not to read very well with tight tracking i think.

The condensed font is Knockout. The good thing it has many weights. Do you think of any alternative to Knockout type?

Thanks!

You are right, there was something in the shadows that was bothering me in the general design. I think if i set it to multiply it will change a lot. 

What do you think about the fonts? I am not sure about the condesed version now...

		<div class="commentbody">Well I definitely prefer the condensed titling face. Maybe close up the ES, NT & ET slightly? Regarding some other typographic observations (and please take these with a grain of salt as I'm not familiar with Spanish typographic rules).

I would raise the En dashes so the're closer to the midline of capitals.

I would personally replace full spaces with thin spaces in Tel. No's.

Not sure about the period after E-Mail ? (I understand it's a contraction but it's so endemic as too almost be a new & complete word in it's own right).

My 2 cents   :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Les,

Thanks for the very very useful tips! the poster look much better now. 

I have to learn more about the fine tuning art of kerning. It really does makes a difference. I have also reduced the space between words too. Do you know of a good book on kerning?

Here is the final versions. I also tried one model without all caps. As Erick Spiekermann once said "Don't Use All Caps" hehe. The second one has a texture background too. What do you think?

UPDATE: for some unknown reason, ISSUU is not showing the mask with the multiply effect. Don't know why.

		<div class="commentbody">Just regarding the kerning, it's a bit uneven. For example, look at the tightness of ESE in the first line, as opposed to the looseness of PRET in the second line.

As for a book on kerning, I'm not so sure a book would help. Good kerning is mostly a matter of seeing, then making those adjustments and compromises necessary to achieve the best possible distribution and balance of positive and negative spaces.

Have you seen the following online kerning game: http://type.method.ac. I don't always agree with some of the designer's solutions, but it's good practice.

For what it's worth, I like the poster.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have to agree with Thylacine here, the kerning is still uneven. It's a difficult thing to advise on because doing one thing has a flow on affect for the rest of the 'word picture'. What you're trying to achieve is optically balanced white space around each letter whilst maintaining whole word cohesion (if that makes sense! I think it's more difficult to describe. than do)   :)

Take D E S E O, I see it more as D ESE O. Kerning is not a science but IS all about the EYE (of which you appear to have a very good one, as this design as a whole attests)

Regarding the skull's shadow, I'm not sure what program you're using so again it's difficult to advise, but I'm pretty sure you need to split the skull from it's shadow somehow, so you have 2 separate objects.

Hope this helps</div>

I will work the kerning again...it happens somethings when you are so fix in one work that you "don't see anymore".

The shadows is working right in the original PDF but ISSUU does make it flatten when it upload the file to its website.
