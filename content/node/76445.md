body: "The \"happy typographic families\" is available!\r\nLearn, understand, revise
  typography and its families with fun and with friends!\r\n74 cards 5,8 x 9,3 cm
  in a plexiglass box.\r\n60 fonts from the most famous foundries are presented.\r\nIn
  French or in English.\r\nPublished by \xC9ditions Deux-Cent-Cinq: http://www.editions205.fr\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JeuCartes_Typophile_6046.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JeuCartes2_Typophile_3826.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JeuCartes3_Typophile_3768.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
  a really \"serious\" game to understand, learn or revise typography and families.\r\nYou
  can play with friends (and even with your children, I played with my children and
  they liked it!) like with a \"happy families\" game.\r\nBut because typography is
  not so simple, rules are a bit more difficult with 2 large families (10 cards) that
  count 2 \"normal\" families (a familie has 6 cards), with a superfamilie (4 cards)
  that allows you to catch a other player's familie (only if you can recite all fonts
  in his family). A real pleasant time, be sure!\r\nThese cards are also real specimens
  to present 60 fonts \u2013 classics or recents from worldwilde foundries (Linotype,
  Underware, 256tm, 205, B&P Typefoundry, FF, OurType, etc.)"
