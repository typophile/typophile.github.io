  trying for something clean, modern, not overpowering and artistic. I feel like i'm
  starting in the right direction but am struggling to bring it all into one piece.
  The hardest part is that I'm not just '\"fill in your name here\" Photography'.
  Its called \"Socal Lag\" but i'm also playing with the idea of incorporating my
  name into it as well. I feel like its complicated to make it simple because of the
  name but I feel like it can work! \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the harsh critiques!
  lol \r\n"

    about the company name?\r\nIf it's \"Socal Lag\" what's your idea behind writing
    it \"SoCal\" and what about the baseline shift on \"Lag\".\r\n\r\nThat'll help
    us understand what you're trying to achieve."

    in any way refer \"Lag\" to photography...\r\n\r\nThat said, about the logo itself:
    why \"Lag\" is placed like it's superscript?\r\nThe type appears a little too
    thin, It could get lost at smaller sizes.\r\nMaybe you can try a more squared
    typeface too.\r\nThe placement of the name don't work so well."

  body: "K, you make a good point on the Lag. \r\nIts meaning is in the slower life
    style that we have here. My business isn't just photography. While I do the normal
    weddings, senior portraits, head shots for actors and freelance jobs, I also do
    design for brochures, front end of sites, and other smaller jobs. \r\nI wanted
    something that would show that it isn't the normal fast paced 'I'm here and then
    I'm gone' kind of vibe. I get to know my clients and there vibe before I start
    working with them, I feel like that makes a difference in the type of work I produce.
    I know its hard to express all that in a name but I feel like if I can capture
    just a little bit of that in the branding then after you meet me it will all click.
    Let me know if that doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nI agree with the superscript of
    lag being confusing. I feel like when its all on the same line it doesn't flow
    as well to the eye. That may be because of the font choice. \r\n\r\nI have no
    strong feelings about the black element. I do like black and white tho, like most
    logos if I can create it to fit in B&W then it is easy to create other versions
    in color.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo4_5159.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo5_4805.jpg]"

    reading either \u2018so called Lag\u2019 or \u2018Social Lag\u2019 into it. As
    long as you\u2019re solely targeting people who immediately translate SoCal into
    Southern California this shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem.\r\nBTW, how would
    you speak out loud your studio name? Sometimes logos work well on paper but fail
    later because the name sounds odd when read.\r\nAnd I second what Ross said, \u2018lag\u2019
    prompts rather negative feelings (again, to me as a non-native E. speaker).\r\n\r\nThe
    logo itself: I think \u2018photography\u2019 is set a tad too tight. Also, the
    lc- l and the UC. L could use a little bit of space. Otherwise the lc. l risks
    to disappear in smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nTo me, too, SoCalLag and Photography still
    lack unity, maybe it\u2019s the Ultra Thin weight and the rather big difference
    in size or the fact that \u2018photography\u2019 doesn\u2019t visually align with
    the lower end of the \u2018g\u2019.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJ\xF6rg"

    plays with the laid back idea of what 'SoCal Lag' is. Jamming them all together
    just makes them seem like one word, forces them to be read too quickly and harms
    legibility. \r\n\r\nI'd also be cautious about using differing weights for the
    type as it'll give emphasis to whichever is heavier. Do you want 'Lag' to be emphasized
    over 'SoCal'? It's a common trend these days, and I'm wondering if it's appropriate
    in this case."

    SoCal is much better and has a way better vibe then 2authentik. instead of lag,
    is there another term used in your location that locals might interpret just the
    same? imo SoCal already has the slower lifestyle in it's dna just because its
    Southern California. No need to re-state it. know what i mean!? SoCal is relaxed
    and chill. Plus, it's versatile. It can be anything you want it to be.
