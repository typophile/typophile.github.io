  body: ' well i checked franklin gothic demi italic/oblique and heavy italic/oblique
    against the logotype &#40;weird how there is an italic as well as an oblique&#41;
    and its definately not the same typeface. it may have been based on franklin gothic,
    but the character shapes are so different, i doubt it. <BR> <BR>i read somewhere
    that a typeface was designed specifically for the microsoft logotype, and possibly
    only the letters of microsoft were done, not an entire typeface, although it didn&#39;t
    state who the designer was or what the typeface was called. <BR> <BR>i did a lot
    of searches using google and just found it unusual that there was no information
    about the designer/company that designed the typeface/logotype, and did the branding.
    <BR> <BR>bill gates conspiracy. ;P <BR> <BR>iota. '
