  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear Typophile,

When checking the forums in recent times, I can't help feeling a little sad that Typophile is not anymore what it was when I first found it, several years ago. I came in with an interest in typography, but a lack of knowledge. Typophile has been a gateway to me to find my way and expand my knowledge, and to highten my awareness of typography in every sense of the way. I came to typophile in the high days of the Pirate Bay, and all fonts where all but a torrent away. Through Typophile I have learned to see the value of type and type design, and I decided to build a legal collection of typefaces from scratch. This has been a joy most of the time, with some lucky bargains, and some mistakes. Typophile has been helpful here, I hope others on a simular position as my own still find typophile as useful as I found it then.

I guess things don't last forever, and Typophile seems to have lost the dynamic it had some time ago. Que sera sera. The internet and "social" media moves fast, and perhaps there are better ways to discuss type than typophile nowadays... I don't know, as I have not been looking so much. Typophile is and was Typophile, I don't need any other type forum, it has served it's purpose for me, so a thank you to all contributors past and present, who have made me a little type wiser. I will not be gone, and I won't be deleting my posts (what's done is done) but I just want to say thanks when there are still some of you around that helped me on my way.

THANKS!</div>

To the typophiles that have been around here for longer: What was it like? What made it better than today, if you agree with this assumption?

		<div class="commentbody">As I said, there was a different dynamic, at least that is how I experienced it. It was more lively (more contributors, more discussion) than it is now, with many contributors that had been very active in the past leaving. I don't know why exactly this has happened, perhaps these communities have a certain lifespan, and as typophile did not change a lot (technically) over the years I guess the needs of the users were not met anymore, so they changed ship or left (just my speculation). I guess it also has to do with the fact that at the beginning there was loads of archives for me to plough through, which I can't be bothered with anymore (also because of the awful search engine, but anyway...). 

I am not a type creator myself, I am a designer using type, and do some handlettering, so perhaps Typophile still is very fruitful for others, concerning technical matters, I can't say. 

I guess it just seemed different then, somehow... :/</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yea, there were a lot more people. There's a lot less people now and of those that are still here, there's a contingency of grumpy folks that insist on slowly deleting every single post they can find in the past out of some petty spitefulness. So, it's not just that the community has shrunk a bit, but also that there seems to be inexplicable grudges remaining. 

It was a good site, though. Learned lots. </div>

Perhaps that erstwhile bitterness is what you miss Jeffrey?

Or are you just getting bored because you’re familiar with the old crew’s schtick, and the newbies don’t have the chops we do?
Come to think of it, today’s newbies are a bit lacking, compared to the likes of Ms Giggles.

James Montalbano always keeps it real. As for deleting his old posts, what’s the diff? —you can’t ﬁnd them on Google anyway, which is a real crime.

If Typophile could get its search happening again and reinstate Featured Fonts, it would have a lot more life.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have never bothered that much with all the 'bitterness', it was fun sometimes, but not what attracted me. What was good was the plurality of voices, some bitter, some blunt, some nice and so on. As there are a lot less voices around, the whole thing just becomes less colorful, less interesting.

That some had a stronger voice and stronger opinions than others was not much of a problem then, as there were many. Now, the friendlyness between you and Hrant might have something to do with the fact that the discussions have become much less interesting/conflicting than they used to be, Nick?

I think Typophile used to be great not because of the rants between its users, but rather despite of it, actually.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think many people used Typophile as a "social quick-fix" (designers -especially type designers- often end up being lonely) but often got drawn into deeper discussions now and again. Now that Twitter and such make superficial socializing so easy (the 140-character limit is a powerfully sad reflection on contemporary social interaction) places like Typophile weaken.

Something like Typophile is a bit like marriage: things change, and people change - but to me at least loyalty is very important. I don't always enjoy being here, but that's not the point for me. Some people aren't meant for marriage, but they shouldn't hate people who are; and they should expect "spouses" to defend each other... in public.  :-)

		<div class="commentbody">Truthfully, I always hated the senseless sniping and personal attacks.  If you want that, watch so-called "Reality" TV. I don't miss that and never will.  However, I don't blame any of the participants in these exchanges for the current vegetative state of Typophile. People all have failings so that sort of thing was akin to family squabbles.  
I do very much miss the sense of community we once had here, and the fun. Typophile was the leading reason I began to be a typeface designer. I got to meet people from all over the World through this site.  
I do hope that the entire history of Typophile posts can be collected into a CD and offered at a reasonable some to all past participants.  That way, we can do our own searches and find whatever interests us most and take the burden off of the Punchcut guys.  They have a business to run and make no money from this venture. I would very much like to thank them for the ride from 2004 until today.  They may even write a book :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thinking some more about the "social fix" angle I mentioned, I realize it's probably connected to the near-total absence of women here these days (which has been noted by others recently). Although I've seen confrontation drive women away before, as Nick said it's been much worse in the past so I don't think that's it. So at the risk of being condemned as sexist I would suggest that, since women are more socially adept and aware they can get their fix better than men in places more conducive to socializing. Which to me is a much bigger loss than a handful of middle-aged white males (coincidentally my own demographic).

		<div class="commentbody">I've been a member since 2003, checking up on new posts most days but very seldom posting. Maybe people like me should have participated/should be participating more. I'd never dream of contributing to this sort of thread normally. Most of the time I'm interested in details/ historical design etc.

Like the others, I too would like to thank the Typophile community. This thread feels a bit like a wake,  but I hope that Typophile will continue to thrive. It's true that the traffic has palpably gone down, and perhaps more worryingly the most knowledgeable ones are not as evident. The professional count has also gone down too I reckon, tho make of that what you will. Most of all, it's not quite so much of a 'learning place' as it used to, although there's still lots of enthusiasm and discovery.

I've learned a huge amount from the site and have grown and watched others grow. Typophile is part of the 'furniture of my mind'. I must say of all the typophile regulars I feel I have learnt most from John Hudson. Wow. You could make a book out of the things that that guy has posted here. Thanks to him and to all.

Hrant,
I don't know about you, but I can't recall even one exchange between 2 women on this board that even bordered on being impolite. Every single urination exchange I can remember has been between 2 males. ;-)</div>

WHY?

There have never been so much people successfully developing quality type than today. Typography has been one of the hot trends of the last decade. And yet, this place seems to just decline in the eye of it’s matter’s rise. I still don’t understand. I have no idea for getting out of this.

Anyway, THANK YOU from me as well, to all who contributed more thought than text.</div>

I can't speak to how he was before I arrived in 2010, but since then I've found Hrant to be nothing if not helpful.  He's one of the only skillful designers who actually frequents the critique section and tries to help out.  He can be very blunt and to some, insensitive; but I prefer that type anyway.  Much better than someone who smiles in your face, all the while plotting on how to stab you in the back.  There's nothing wrong with people having strong opinions and defending them strongly.  Since when did everybody start thinking they need to have their asses kissed before they could talk to someone?  I run into this at work all the time.  You can't be honest with people anymore, or else you're an asshole.

***

Also, I wonder how close the drop off here was to the drop off of the economy in '08?  I'd bet a lot of people who had some excess money around before that decided to take up type design.  Then when the economy crashed and they lost their day jobs--just no more time leftover for type design anymore, which certainly doesn't pay the bills.  Let's face it, its more of a hobby.  Who has time for hobbies when they're trying to figure out how to feed their families?

Oh, and also, these little brats running around deleting their old comments are yet one more reason why I feel there should be a time limit on how long you can edit a post.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the undesirable degree of sensitivity to criticism comes from the "artiste" strain that all creative people inherently have. It's just that for too many of us self-expression seems to become more of an objective than an enabler, so any criticism that aims to improve the functionality of the result is instead taken as a personal attack on the creative self. To me the world doesn't need our self-expression nearly as much as it needs our servitude, and the opinions of fellow designers -especially the negative ones- can only help. Questions... mistakes... doubt... that's where the gold is in terms of cultural progress.

Concerning the economy angle, to me it has long seemed an interesting paradox. The most prominent example I've witnessed that makes me doubt the "bad economy = less type design" formula is that before the collapse of the Argentinian economy (and the strong regional ripple effect) at the turn of the millennium South America was nowhere on the map in terms of type design, but <em>right in the thick of it</em> they started producing amazing work, winning TDC awards, the works. Equally telling is that there's much more quality <em>free</em> type than there has ever been; if people were so busy paying bills that wouldn't be happening.

But maybe what <em>is</em> happening is that people who do [try to] make a living by relying heavily on type design (there are more of them than you might think) are sick of providing free help to people who release good free fonts, reducing their own income potential.

I guess Free Help is only considered a bad thing when the 'giving' party seems to get nothing from the occasion, either gratitude or insight or whatnot. I am not always in the mood of giving either, but sometimes enjoy having a look at someones work (when I feel there is spirit in it) and try to help to improve it. I learn from this as well, on a human level. But when it feels like there is no point in giving critique, I guess I would not want to bother either. 

It was and is not always only about a novice taught by an expert, as experts learn from other experts, as do novices from other novices.

@Andreas

Apologies, as I did not want to turn this into a tombstone thread to Typophile. I just felt like expressing gratitude for what it has done to me, but I guess a certain degree of melancholie is just a part of looking back... I almost feel like singing out : "don't you forget about me!" :) )</div>

To be a primadonna one needs great skill and <em>demonstrated</em> experience. You cannot be one without substantial career or success. I am happy to forgive a bit of pettiness or emotion to those whose work I respect and admire. After all, it was reported that Mozart was petulant and juvenile… On the other hand, people who are yet to make a contribution, or to show any talent should me more guarded in their pronouncements, lest they appear to be hollow poseurs.

<em>precious-individual-snowflakes</em>

It is a judgement of others that matters, Ryan and Hrant. Someone other than you has to appreciate your work. Otherwise the joke is on you, I am afraid.

@dezcom & others, you know who you are: Thank you for your help, advice and gentle humour.

Good bye.

<blockquote>It is a judgement of others that matters</blockquote>

Agreed. What makes you believe that I get no appreciation of my work? Is it that you personally don't think much of it? That's not very important to me, or anybody else besides you. It's the same for all of us. And really, if nobody objects you're probably merely a passenger in this life. Dieu vomit les tièdes.

		<div class="commentbody">I need you people to stop being concern trolls. Typophile’s decline is due to a host of factors, as has been described here and elsewhere. The fact that Joe Pemberton, who runs this site behind the scenes, bans the word “phuck” (because he’s a Mormon) but <em>never banned Hrant</em> is a prime example of the lasting dysfunction of Typophile.

Hrant has always been a problem, one that should have been addressed long ago. Hrant can go work on Armenian fonts and call himself a “rogue” academic on his own time. We don’t need him here and never did need him. It is an enduring myth that members known to be harmful have as much of a “right” to partake in a  private forum as everyone else. Responsible operators of forums ban troublemakers. Hrant causes trouble. He is <em>not</em> merely a lovable and misunderstood scamp with as much of a “right” to be here as anyone else.

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, Chris, in the process of one which Typophilers might find interesting.

For the past thirty years there's been a kind of "stealth" translation going on of about 12,000 pages of records from the Dutch East India Company dating from the days when it ran New Amsterdam - also known as the  island of Manhattan.
I'm reading a book based on that research called The Island At The Center Of The World. A great story - at least for a native New Yorker like me who graduated from a high school named after New Amsterdam's most famous boss, Petrus Stuyvesant, without ever really knowing all that much about him or the very beginnings of Manhattan; the beginnings of America, really. So little history was available until recently.
Unlike other settlements, it turns out New Yawk was a melting pot from day one.
(Of course, history is written by the victors, and as far as the Brits were concerned, Manhattan didn't rate any note until it became New York and not New Amsterdam. But in fact, the city's DNA was set during Dutch rule and was vastly different from the English settlements of the period in Virginia and Massachusetts. Blacks (both slave and free), Jews, Germans, Dutch, English, Spanish - you name the background - they all lived side by side in that miniscule community. Something like eighteen languages were spoken among just a few hundred initial inhabitants. And if you included the languages of the Native American populations nearby, you would probably have to double that number.) 
My understanding, according to the book, is that the Dutch language of the 1600s is vastly different from modern Dutch, hence the struggle to translate. It's been the life's work of one guy: a Dr. George Gehring. I'm going to try and get my hands on some pics to see what the script looks like.  Supposedly it's a real hodgepodge of glyphs, but if any Typophilers are  familiar with Dutch as it was then written in, say, 1625, might be able to fill us in.

As far as the post which started this thread is concerned, the reports of Typophile's death are greatly exaggerated. I hope it continues on.  There is an ebb and flow to everything.  What is old becomes new again.

That book sounds very interesting. As a fellow New Yorker and Pegleg, I tried to look you up in a very incomplete Alumni Directory dated 1992 (classes from 1904-1991), but you weren't there.  I'm betting that my year (1952) was much earlier than yours!  There was a Garry Fink in my class, which has nothing to do with anything.

And as for this thread, it's really obvious: 
  1) Things change
  2) Nostalgia ain't what it used to be.

Yeah, I'm a whippersnapper next to you.
1971 

The last all-male graduating class. I didn't attend, but at the reunion last year, Alice DeRivera, the woman who's lawsuit against the city broke the gender barrier gamely accepted an invitation. I say gamely because her family moved from New York shortly after she was accepted and she never actually attended Stuyvesant as a student.

BTW - P. Stuyvesant was a Jew-hating son of a bitch.  But it's still hard for me not to admire him.  The toughest possible bastard you could imagine. (That much is clear. But I've still got a ways to go in the book. 14 bucks via Kindle. BTW.)

Did you play football by any chance? Even if not, Murl Thrush was probably coach when you were there. He retired a year after I graduated.

@Richard
I realise Typophile is not dying, I just reflected on the very fact that things change, and that this fact, and the slump seemingly going on at the moment making me a bit nostalgic, for the old days. If you or anyone read this as an epitaph, this was not what I intended, and I'm still very much interested in contributing to Typophile in the years to come.

		<div class="commentbody">From Twitter: “<em>Further evidence of Typophile’s demise :^( ... | Typophile http://typophile.com/node/59695</em>”

Not sure why or what is going on here, but perhaps focusing on positive and productive would be more fruitful. And in-fighting and name-calling within the same thread where people are complaining about just that, and leaving because of it? Really?

How about we start off by making a list, and ask for volunteers.

1. Deleting posts does render a thread somewhat useless, and will certainly cripple us. Obviously, the result is a terms of service agreement. Anyone have any lawyer friends?

2. Today’s newbs are lacking. Agree, but why? One reason IMO, because we’re “well known suckers” for doing their homework. Just stop doing it and help them help themselves. You’re stunting their growth and pissing in your own pool.

3. Search engine: find a coder.

4. Banner: find a no-Flash solution (and a coder)

5. Site re-design: Finish it. I will help. Just email me.

6. Content: Work on the Wiki. I can help. Just email me.

7. Moderators: if the were a more active presence, I believe this would help new users feel more comfortable participating lest they step into the middle of a cat-fight. This does of course raise the point of being mindful of of over-moderating, and deterring participation, but that doesn’t mean we can’t attempt to find a solution. For the thread, this is Wikipedia’s bit on moderators: 

<em>The moderators (short singular form: “mod”) are users (or employees) of the forum who are granted access to the posts and threads of all members for the purpose of moderating discussion (similar to arbitration) and also keeping the forum clean (neutralizing spam and spambots etc.).[12] Because they have access to all posts and threads in their area of responsibility, it is common for a friend of the site owner to be promoted to moderator for such a task. Moderators also answer users' concerns about the forum, general questions, as well as respond to specific complaints. They also can do anything to lend a helping hand to a user in need.[13] Moderators themselves may have ranks: some may be given mod privileges over only a particular topic or section (called “local”), while others (called “global” or “super”) may be allowed access anywhere. Common privileges of moderators include: deleting, merging, moving, and splitting of posts and threads, locking, renaming, stickying of threads, banning, suspending, unsuspending, unbanning, warning the members, or adding, editing, removing the polls of threads.[14] “Junior Modding”, “Backseat Modding”, or “Forum copping” can refer negatively to the behavior of ordinary users who take a moderator-like tone in criticizing other members.

Essentially, it is the duty of the moderator to manage the day-to-day affairs of a forum or board as it applies to the stream of user contributions and interactions. The relative effectiveness of this user management directly impacts the quality of a forum in general, its appeal, and its usefulness as a community of interrelated users.

Moderators also have categories e.g. “Global Moderators” and just “Moderators.” Global moderators have the rights to moderate the complete forum while moderators can be assigned only to the sub-forum.[15]</em>

I believe someone needs to be given the authority to give orders and enforce them. Otherwise, we’ll simply end up driving around in circles. Wait, we’re already doing that.

Currently, I see people in panic mode. All I see is a rough patch and a few tweets. Rhetorical question: How does a 50 year marriage work? Because they have magically found “the one” and everything simply works perfectly? No. Because when shit hits the fan they have a cup of concrete, harden up, and work through it <strong>together</strong>.

And as far as my “I will help. Just email me” comment, I mean it. I already spend 1-3h a day here. I have my own ever-unfinished site, but given the prominence and history of Typophile, I’d be more than willing to divide my attention.

		<div class="commentbody">I have a practical suggestion. It isn't criminal and doesn't involve hrant.

Please, please, subject each post within a thread to a word count and insert a 'read more' link after a set number of words. 1) It encourages people to get to the point. 2) It makes scanning the thread for comments of interest a much quicker proposition.

Of course, the balance of the stylistically truncated comment will still be there in the HTML  - search engines won't have any difficulties - and these days implementing a hide/show such as what I'm describing is a snap. I'm sure there are more plug-ins available for it than a developer would want to wade through.

And if it's an issue of concern, a print style sheet can reveal everything hiding behind the 'read more' links so that, on print, nothing goes unrevealed.

		<div class="commentbody">As a student who mostly lurks I don't pretend to speak for the whole "class", but I'll make clear some points I think people still don't get:

• All the other students I know who are interested in typography are on typophile in one way or another. There are hundreds of invisible users who are here studying and learning from the immense resource that is typophile, and not posting anything new. Which introduces point 2.

• The search is broken. And it's not pretty. I think the administrator underestimates the importance of typophile as an help to research and understanding, because without search all those lurking people are helpless to say the least, and all this typopatrimony is virtually GONE. This is serious. Does a tree falling in a forest... ?

• Anonymity is generally not accepted, but in a world of search engines it is necessary to hide while learning. Everything one posts on his behalf is potentially reachable by an employer or other professionals, and you can't imagine how much prejudice there is about learning via an online forum. Having some sort of editing or anonymity—or making it not searchable—may help the critique forum too, if you implement some kind of filter (1$ per thread?). Oh but wait, it is already not searchable!

• Hrant isn't a huge issue, not as much as people depict him. If you are on typophile for a while you know what he thinks and believes, and it's interesting (sometimes) to hear such a strong and uncommon viewpoints, though I should say that not banning him once is quite strange. Nevertheless there are people that think of him as the only reason of typophile's decline(?): this is much more extreme than anything ever posted by hrant.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I just want to say that, infighting between certain specific folks notwithstanding, one of the remarkable things that helped draw me into typography as a profession is how friendly and helpful so many people in the field are. Even quite a few Big Name People who don't have as much to gain by it, and are likely to have more of their time sucked up by it. When I first got really serious about type around 1994, I emailed three such people, and every one of them emailed me back and was genuinely helpful. Robert Bringhurst, Chuck Bigelow, and Don Hosek. (Don may be kind of more obscure now, but at the time he was the publisher of a new typography magazine called Serif, and it was very cool.)

Anyway, I for one am happy to try to give back to the community a bit now that I am blessed enough to have a decent-paying job doing stuff I love. That's why I'm on the ATypI board. That's why I took on an intern (Andrea Harrison) recently. It seems like a lot of my peers feel the same way. Andrea had a great experience at TypeCon, from the type crit to... well, everything I think. She felt welcomed and got boatloads of useful information and feedback.

So, as far as I can tell on average the professional type community is pretty cool and helpful to newcomers, and has been for a long time. Yes there's squabbling, and I know some folks have had negative experiences. That's a pity. But in general, compared to a lot of communities... pretty good.</div>
