    comes pretty close... only the A & E don't seem to match but that is easily changed...
    I also think Huxley is free typeface! I say there is a better match I'm j\xFAst

  body: I think <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/south-beach/">South
    Beach</a> is close also, the only differences being the spur on the "G", and the
    lack of an extending crossbar on the "A".

    have to modify the crossbars a bit."
