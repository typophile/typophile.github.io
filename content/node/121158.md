body: "I am working on a book proposal that involves the use of a Completely modified
  version of Times New Roman to be more Appropriate for Display or at Larger Sizes.
  This is a commercial project with the potential for Wide Distribution so I want
  to as clear about the legality as possible. Otherwise, I (with a bit of shame) would
  not really worry about it, but agin this is not that...\r\n\r\nI Heavily modified
  the font, not just computationally through interpolation, but also in more nuanced
  and pre-meditated ways that literally alter the letter forms at a fundemental level
  i.e. serifs, bowls, shoulders, etc.\r\n\r\nI have attached sample of the original
  I used and then the altered version(at 3/4 complete).\r\n\r\nOriginal\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TNR_4978.png]\r\n\r\nDisplay\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NTNR_3854.png]"

  body: "First, you need to read the source license for the font to see if it allows
    modifications.\r\n\r\nSecond, if it does allow modification, contact the original
    vendor and ask them for permission.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you are probably not legal,
    but that is just my opinion, not that of a lawyer."

  body: "Since you\u2019ve modified an already existing font, you\u2019ve created
    a derivative work. Unless you used an open-source font, it\u2019s extremely unlikely
    that you can sell this commercially. You should have started from scratch, not
    from altering someone else's font. However, for the final say, check the end user
    licence agreement or contact the originating foundry.\r\n\r\n"

  body: And since there are scads of open-source imitations of Times Roman available,
    there is no need to use one of the proprietary versions as the basis.

  body: If the license does not allow modification your are not legal - the software
    is what is protected and that is what you changed with you modifications.

  body: You could use something like Starling Book, which is very similar to TNR and
    somewhat lighter, as a display font.

  body: "Alright so I am a little unclear about what is appropriate...\r\n\r\nI have
    no intention in selling this typeface, rather it was a solution to a problem presented
    during the design process. Times New Roman is clunky so I made it not that or
    at least curbed it a bit. This is purely for the design of a book that maybe distributed
    commercially. Again I have no intentions in selling or distributing the font software,
    but merely to use what I created in an academic project, nonetheless I have sent
    monotype an email. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how URW++ and their numerous derivatives
    are able to be sold commercially?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid"

  body: Many fonts restrict modifying the font for your own use, not just redistributing
    the result.
