  How do i move them in the font window, can i drag them in some way? I'm trying to
  mach their sequence on each font of the familly. How can i use the same table throughout
  the entire familly, when i allready have all the fonts created?\r\n\r\nRegards"

    you like, save it as a custom encoding and apply it to your other fonts."

    a little difficult to control. \r\n\r\nI will try to save my encoding as you suggest
    and apply it to the other fonts as well. I guess i could save it from the toolbar
    glyph menu , but I'll have to figure out were to import it next.\r\n\r\nBest"

    support/fontlab/encoding\r\n\r\nYou can later on see the encoding here.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/encoding_5573.png]\r\nIt
    is also possible to open encodings in i text editor and type, arrange, add or
    delete. Just type the names of the glyphs in the order yu want them, and they
    will appear in FontLab that way."

  body: "I guess when I choose save encoding, fontlab didn't promped me to browse
    a location to save it... I presume it will be saved in the location you mentioned.
    \r\nSo then i will have my encoding available as the default encoding? I thought
    it would apear as imported encoding, not the default...  But I will try it and
    see how it goes. \r\n\r\nThanks for reply\r\nBest"

  body: "Sorry for my non-pedagogic response.\r\n\r\nYou should look for the name
    of your specific encoding, not \"Default Encoding\". This was just to show in
    which menu your encoding will show up .)\r\n\r\nName your encoding to what you
    want it to be called, and then look for that name in the drop down menu as shown
    above.\r\n\r\nWhen you save your encoding, make sure it is saved in the right
    folder and also give it a proper name when saving it."
