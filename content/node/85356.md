body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\nI took a bit of time over the weekend to expand a couple
  of PHP scripts I made for my own development into a little online tool that might
  be useful to some:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ninastoessinger.com/stringmaker/\">Stringmaker</a>
  is a simple online tool which can be used to quickly generate test strings of the
  following patterns:\r\nnnnannn\r\nnnnaxnnn\r\nnnnaxannn\r\n\u2026 which can be useful
  for spacing and kerning. The idea is to let the tool generate basic strings which
  can then be copy-pasted to InDesign or something and formatted as needed to test
  type designs in progress.\r\n\r\nFor the variables \"a\" and \"x\" above you can
  choose between lowercase, uppercase, numerals, punctuation, or alternately input
  custom (wordspace-delimited) lists of characters. Like maybe \"f\"s and i-diacritics,
  or even non-Latin characters. There is a live pattern preview that should let you
  see what you're doing (requires JavaScript).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stringmaker-shot_6359.gif]\r\n\r\nI'm
  hoping that some of you find this useful, and if you think there's any fixes that
  would make it more so please let me know. I'm happy for feedback \u2013 it's all
  still very beta, and I'm really not all that much of a developer, so if something's
  broken please let me know.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNina"

  body: "Updated by popular request (over on Facebook) to allow for custom base/fill
    characters, and not just single ones but 2-character combinations too.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    Craig has pointed to this alternate site that does something similar: \r\nhttp://www.gestaltungssache.at/buchstaben.php?gen=1\r\n\u2026
    which I didn't previously know about.\r\n\r\nEdit: Is there a common sentiment
    that allowing for fill strings of arbitrary length (>2) would be useful/wanted?"

    each input character might be that it won''t allow output strings to show how
    the wordspace actually fits with other characters, which might be a helpful facility.'

  body: "Hm. Yeah, right now the wordspace is stripped out of input strings. There
    IS however a wordspace (nonbreaking space, actually) included in the \"punctuation\"
    set (between the endash and the underscore); would that do?\r\n\r\nEdit: An advantage
    of using a delimited list (be it by wordspace, or comma \u2013 I personally find
    wordspace more intuitive) is that it's possible to input multi-character entries,
    for instance HTML entities such as (drum roll) <em>& nbsp ;</em> (in one word)
    for a nonbreaking space. :-)"

    could have an HTML palette to input those &clunky; &HTML; &entities; &that; &I;

    will generate longer lists, I think. It can also generate lists using Fontlab
