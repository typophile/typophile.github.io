  BUT the only \"Tiffany\" font I can find is the ITC font which is not this font.
  \ Does anybody know another name for this font or somewhere I could find this font?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\nDB\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tiffany_graphic_5433.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tiffany_font_3857.jpg]"
