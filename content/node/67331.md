  body: It looks like <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/gilmore-sans-rr/">Gilmore
    Sans</a> (squooshed) from [[Red Rooster]], but I know there is another font and
    the name is alluding me.

  body: "Maybe you are thinking of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bodega-sans/|Bodega
    Sans]]? However, that is low waisted, with crossbars that extend through the vertical
    strokes. The letterforms, otherwise, are pretty similar.\r\n\r\nI think you got
    it with Gilmore, or did you mean that there is another name for the font?\r\n\r\n-
