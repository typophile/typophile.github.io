  body: Well, it certainly didn't originate from a single source, but the font used
    was Nick Curtis' <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/p.htm"
    target="_blank">Pastiche</a>. The U is cobbled together from the L and even the
    lovely lady is cropped from the J.
