  murals. I have lots of high-res royalty free stock that is suitable but obviously
  none of it is the size I need. The images I have are 8\" x 5\" at 300dpi - how big
  can these go without really looking poorly?\r\n\r\nThe highest any site seems to
  offer is roughly 17\" x 11\" at 300dpi."

  body: "Probably wouldn't go with vectorising large detailed imagery!?!?\r\n\r\nThe
    resolution that is needed to look good all depends on how close the viewer will
    be.\r\n10-20dpi is for the large bilboardlike banners on top of buildings etc.
    If you are going to have people close to the subject matter like inside a retail
    space I probably wouldn't go any lower than 70dpi. \r\n\r\nAn alternative solution
    to vectorising them is to interpolate them at 300dpi in sclae 1:1 and make a halftone
    bitmap with circles (freq:1 angle:45 for example).\r\nThis will give you an Lichtenstein
    feel up close but and a true image far away. This could again be vectorised but
    you will need a pretty powerfull computer and heaps of slices in your image. "

  body: Alien Skin makes a plugin for Photoshop called Blow Up that can help you get
    better results when scaling up photos. At extreme settings, it can look a little
    weird (curves get flattened out into a series of straight lines, and color gradients
    near edges can also get flattened out), but it generally does a good job, and
    it's not too expensive.

  body: "I've used images at 50 dpi for large trade show banners. More important than
    our experience...You need to talk to the vendor who will be printing the banner.
    Talk to their pre-press department. \r\n\r\nHere's a handy PDF. The second page
    is especially useful. But, again, talk to your vendor:\r\nhttp://www.johnevanscompany.com/specs.pdf\r\n"

  body: "There has to be some conventional rules in the billboard industry, yet upon
    searching I get various answers.\r\nI worked in grand format printing for a while,
    and we had no inhouse set of rules to hand out to customers because most of them
    were just not willing to cooperate or technically savvy enough ( makes you wonder
    ... ).\r\n\r\nA lot of the old rules for billboard are based on the idea that
    screens are going to be used, but with digital printing, usage of pixels, the
    conception has to be seen from a different angle.\r\n15 dpi far viewing, 72+ dpi
    close viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally whenever I had to make some designing with
    images, depending on available files etc, I aimed for a 72~150 dpi final output
    resolution. If the supplied file didn't fit from a size or resolution perspective
    ( which they NEVER do ) I would do upscaling using Genuine Fractals. \r\nThis
    does involve using some pricey software but the output is simply amazing.\r\nIn
    one case I ran a series of 4x3meter banners which were exclusively pictures and
    the customer supplied files were .....240 dpi ... 100ko, 500ko and the likes .....
    10x20cm etc .... pure rubbish files which I thankfully could use because of said
    software.\r\n\r\nIt's tricky being in situations like this. Best of luck."

  body: "For large-scale graphics from poor-res sources, I usually enlarge the images
    to the final size, at a 100-150dpi, then add a little grain the hide the artifacts.
    In my experience, it also helps if the pictures are gray-scale or duotone.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal
