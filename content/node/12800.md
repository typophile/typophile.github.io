  typographic magazines are none existing at the kiosks in Norway. \r\nI have previously
  subscribed to Baseline, which I'm satisfied with,\r\nbut does anyone have any other
  magazines to suggest?\r\n\r\nI has to be in english, and I'm looking to learn more
  about, \r\ntechnical and historical aspects of typography.\r\n\r\nOystein"

  body: "i think <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12149\">we've agreed</a> that
    actual wiki entry titles shouldn't contain diacritics, but they should be displayed
    in the body copy. but i can change that to display the \xE1 for you as i did in
    my post above."

  body: "The reason I worried over the acute is that in the entry for [[Rub\xE9n Fontana]]
    (which has a diacritic, too), there's a link to  [[tipoGr\xE1fica]]. I guess it's
    that entry that needs to be updated, not the \"Publications\" one. Sorry for not
    having read the Wiki etiquette thread. Will do sometime soon. :)"

    Design in Karlsruhe. This is the same team that runs the German design blog <a
    href=\"http://www.slanted.de\">Slanted.de</a>. They gave away the first issue
    (#0) at TYPO Berlin. The magazine appears to be mostly in German, with some English.
    If you can read German (or even if you can't\u2026) I think a subscription may
    be worth it.\r\n\r\nCall them up, or e-mail them at <a href=\"http://www.magma-ka.de/index.html\">MAGMA</a>
    for subscription info.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
