body: "\"By all means break the rules, and break them beautifully, deliberately, and
  well. That is one of the ends for which they exist.\"\r\n- Robert Bringhurst, The
  Typographic Elements of Style\r\n\r\nWhen I read this passage (in context) I was
  immediately inspired to create a composition.\r\n\r\nGiven the sentiment, there
  is an awkward irony in posting this here for feedback. This is only a draft, and
  it happens to be my first endeavor of anything of this sort (i.e., typography simply
  for the sake of art, not for advertising, etc.).\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism is
  welcome. Thank you kindly.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
