  I might post something of myself here.\r\n\r\nI'm working on this t-shirt project.
  \r\nI started it just for the fun of it, but now I have plans of producing it.\r\n\r\nIt
  is not finished. I have to take a closer look at the type. So this is more of a
  sketch.\r\n\r\nLet me know what your thoughts are!\r\n\r\nThe idea \u2013 in general
  and short \u2013 is that we all eat, sleep and breath type! Hence the lungs.\r\n\r\nMy
  idea was to make it a limited edition. But am not sure about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour
  input is appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nRay\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tee_4418.jpg]"

    A surprise once you see it?\r\n\r\nPersonaly I feel it is not a bad thing when
    the graphic itself is interesting enough (perhaps together with a text line creating
    ).\r\n\r\n"

    think of anything you could do to the lungs to make them more lungy without ruining

    on multiple levels \"keep on giving\". I feel that one dimensional solutions tend
    to be more vulnerable to dating. The challenge is always to a make a 'deep' solution
    'simple'. A classic example of this is the Fedex logo."

    the y. So I think I'll switch back. Unless you have got a good reason not to?\r\n\r\nI
    was also playing with some colors. \r\nAt the bottom some modern colors. But they

    45degree lines add a nice feel to it, but I can't think of a good reason why I
    should use them. They don't add to the concept. What do you think?\r\nThe reason
    for adding the lines was to break the big chunks. But actualy, that is what is

  body: I got the T and the Lungs right off. I think the concept is strong. I like
    it! The abstract shapes and negative space work well for me. You could try another
    direction as well... a more classical serif T along with scroll work, or drafting
    texture in the lung area to simulate capillaries. That could take it in the direction
    of "the Anatomy of Man" DaVinci style. Which I have always associated with the
    medical profession, It could strengthen the "life Support" "Type Support" link,
    or is might just clutter up the nice simple structure you have going on now. Who
    knows?

  body: "The T is in a very rigid style. This gives the \"lungs\" a blocky shape that
    is a further remove from the idea of lungs. Are they lung bitmaps blown up? Why
    so blocky? Low-res lungs? \r\n\r\nWhat I'm getting at is that your T shape is
    clear but your lung shapes could really stand to look more like lungs. Start with
    the shape of 2 lungs and see how you can adapt the outer contour to become a recognizable
    T shape. Consider large, bracketed serifs at foot and at top that follow more
    the contour of lungs. Right now, no matter how many times I read the word \"lungs\",
    I still just see blocks that conceal a T. \r\n\r\nYou may have to.... Gosh dare
    I say it?..... HAND-DRAW IT!!!!\r\n\r\n[sob]"
