body: "The birth of the monospaced types dates back to the past. There was a need
  for the creation of typesets for typewriters. The difficulty was to align the different
  glyphs in the same width. This led to particular problems with letters like \u201CM\u201D
  and \u201Cl\u201D; the former seemed to be squeezed into the same width of all letters
  and the second one appeared way too streched. Despite \u2013 or perhaps because
  of \u2013 the impression of the typewriter is still popular with Graphic Designers.
  Nowadays there are even monospaced versions of primarily proportional types; for
  example the the Sans Mono designed by Lucas de Groot or the DIN Mono.\r\n\r\nThen
  again, why not the other way round?! In the first half of the Nineties, Erik Spiekermann
  developed a proportional type named ITC Officina based on the Letter Gothic. According
  to a survey on the 100 best fonts of all time conducted by FontShop, ITC Officina
  is in an eighth place, far ahead of its forerunner. This was the reason for me to
  create a wider design with a Serif and a Sans Serif based on the queen of all monosped
  types \u2013 the Courier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://fonts.gestalten.com/hellschreiber-sans.html#\r\nhttp://fonts.gestalten.com/hellschreiber-serif.html#\r\n\r\nwww.schmitt-joerg.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sans_Hs_Web_SplashScreen_918x416_5223.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serif_Hs_Web_SplashScreen_918x416_4134.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sans_Hs_Web__Interpunktion_5327.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sans_Hs_Web__Uebersicht_4830.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sans_Hs_Web__Wasserfall_5919.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sans_Hs_Web__Plakat_A_6485.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sans_Hs_Web__Plakat_B_5318.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serif_Hs_Web__Uebersicht_3644.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serif_Hs_Web__Diakr-Zeichen_6150.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serif_Hs_Web__Plakat_A_4503.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serif_Hs_Web__Plakat_B_5230.jpg]"
