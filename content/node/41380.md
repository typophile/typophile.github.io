  of a matching dingbats-font. (Arrows, icons ecc).\r\nSo far I have been considering
  FF Info, FF Transit.\r\nAny idea appreciated."

  body: Wow, Tarzana is a fairly idiosyncratic face for public wayfinding. I commend
    your bravery. I really think any basic arrows will do. You don't want them to
    be too stylized, especially when they are meant to direct people quickly and clearly.

  body: You are both right. I have been pondering that choice for a while myself.
    But its a small project for a small city, whose CI-font is Tarzana. Still I have
    to do final testing in 1/1 scale.

  body: You'd be better off using something proven, and compatible, in the field,
    so to speak, and then, perhaps, having the name of the city (much smaller) in
    Tarzana (if at all) on the signs.

  body: "The signage, besides giving direction to pedestrians, is supposed to transport
    identity and image for that place. It does not need to be too classical, as long
    as it works. All the touristic material for this small city, all the posters ecc.
    are set in Tarzana. Can\u2019t upload examples right now, as I am out of office
    on my laptop."
