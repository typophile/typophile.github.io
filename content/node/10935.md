    level of the Font Identification Forum to find the link&#41;. <BR> <BR>This is

  body: 'Mike -- a couple of type-id forum protocols: <BR> <BR>1. When posting a font
    id request, it&#39;s best to start a new thread rather than adding to an existing
    one. <BR> <BR>2. Generally speaking, we don&#39;t trade fonts here, unless they&#39;re
    free to begin with or one of us is the designer of such a font and has the generosity
    &#40;and legal ability&#41; to give it away. <BR> <BR>That said, the font you&#39;re
    looking for is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/handle-old-style/handle-oldstyle/testdrive.html?s=Zinfandel&amp;p=96">Handle
    Oldstyle</a>. Plus, you&#39;re relatively in luck: it&#39;s only <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?nCo=AFMT&amp;pid=203066">$22</a>.'

    leisurely response. Plenty of time being, of course, fifteen minutes.

    <BR> <BR>Hi Isaac, thanks. I wish it were under happier circumstances. I know
    the war ain&#39;t completely over yet, but I consider the fall of Bagdad as the
    beginning of the end &#40;&#34;the end&#34; being a new era of colonization, preemptive
    wars destabilizing major regions in the world, a fascist-like government in the
    USA and a whole bunch of new Saddams and Osamas in the making&#41;. Though it&#39;s
    a good thing that Saddam&#39;s &#40;apparently&#41; out of the picture, the end
    result doesn&#39;t justify the means. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    crack some type IDs.
