body: "Just wondering if there is any technical protocol for creating a double or
  single story of each character? I initially thought sans serif leaned towards single
  story characters and vice versa (serif typefaces were typically two story) but I
  see this isn't mandatory. \r\n \r\nAccording to the ever-correct Wikipedia, there
  is no technical right or wrong.\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\r\n&\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any recommendations or preferences when you create these letters in
  a new typeface?"

  body: "Well, in a text font, such as you'd use for a book, you typically use the
    two-story variants of both letters. This helps people distinguish between a, q,
    and g. In italics, the a normally goes to one story, but the g more often than
    not keeps both stories. (But there are some text fonts with a one-story g.) \r\n\r\nIn
    any other kind of font, though, there aren't really rules. I'd say (non-italic)
    fonts with a two-story g probably almost always have a two-story a, but the reverse
    isn't true\u2014tons of sans serif fonts have a two-story a and a one-story g. "

  body: Since single story versions have fewer horizontal strokes to stack up, they
    are often attractive alternatives for fonts with relatively thick horizontals,
    such as monoline or low-contrast sans faces. (Especially true for /g/.) Note that
    Gill Sans Ultra (to name one example) switches over to the single-story form.

  body: I've heard it said that the lc italic /g/ used when setting mathematical equations
    should be single-story, but have not yet heard a convincing rationale for why
    this should be true. I've seen it done both ways, and it doesn't seem to make
    a difference in legibility to my eyes. If anything, making /q/ and /g/ distinct
    is a very good reason to use a double-story /g/. I've seen one book that skimped
    on the typography and blindly adhered to the single-story rule and ended up using
    a very sans-looking single-story lc italic /g/ with Times italic to very poor
    effect.
