  when I was making it (just wanted to make it as neutral as possible), but I think
  it turned out to resemble Century Schoolbook somehow. I haven't done any kerning
  as of yet, but I'm quite happy with the result so far. Tell me what you think of
  it.\r\nBTW: I'm still not working with grayscale pixelfonts, so it's still not as
  crisp as it could be ;-)"

    tribute to geometric slabs</a> that is similar to yours in some ways.

    couple of quick things:\r\n- The head serifs on the \"u\" should probably be leftward

    versions before settling down with this, so unconsciously the aesthetic part must
    have played a role in my decision.\r\nAs for the lc u, that was probably due to
    not paying a lot of attention ;-) It seems a bit odd now, but I'm not really sure
    it actually bothers me\u2026 I'll have to make a comparison first & let it rest
    a while before I decide (when you work on something for too long, you can't see
    the forest for the trees anymore). I'm still working on more swash variations
    & after that I'll take a break from Minimade for a couple of days.\r\nThe length
    of the ascenders however w\xE1s a deliberate choice. Along with the x-height &
    descenders, it was the only thing I had already determined when I started this.
    I didn't want it to end up looking too jagged, so I used the same measurements
    everywhere which I like to think it adds a little personality (or maybe amateurism?
    ;-p) to the font.\r\nIf anything, I think the descenders could benifit from an
    extra pixel, but again, I wanted to keep it simple."

    why Typophile is very usefull for people like me who have no educational background

    now on it's something I'll keep in mind.\r\n\r\nSince I started fooling around
    in Fontographer a couple of years ago, I already see some progress in my work.\r\nPixelfonts
    are actually great for learning about typedesign; they don't leave you with too
    much room for choice (or in other words, they eliminate a large part of  doubt)
    which I find quite stimulating, it justifies a mathematical approach (which again
    simplifies things) & its simplicity & sheer size can camouflage (or compensate
    for) a lack of know-how.\r\nThanks to the comments here, I'm also learning a lot
    about the relationships between characters & the actual use of a font."

  body: "> Are you referring to anyone in particular?\r\n\r\nWell, in this thread
    Underware in particular, but in general I'm talking about designers who believe
    that their favorite world order is more important than the results. It's a justification
    of creation over function, which is Art and not Design.\r\n\r\n> Pixelfonts are
    actually great for learning about typedesign\r\n\r\nI agree (although many designers
    do loathe them). Besides the paradoxically refreshing limiting of choice, there
    is a purity to bitmap font design; something that makes you think in a certain
    healthy way that vector-editing tends to obscure. Maybe it's because the illusion
    is fully broken, so you can see -or at least feel- the heart of the matter.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I can imagine some typedesigners loathe pixelfonts, but in terms of designing
    is apples & oranges. It may be easier (especially to start with), but it takes
    a completely different state of mind.\r\nI love vectors for their flexibility
    & 'weightlessness', but it's something very different. Pixels are not just about
    stripping down an image to its core, it's much more than that. The illusion is
    indeed broken, but you create an entirely new one with the right use of pixels
    (e.g. creating rounded shapes by pixelplacement). It has a lot to do with 'feeling'
    where all the pixels should (or should n\xF3t) go -much as bezierpoints in vectorial
    design- & it requires more thinking outside the box than vectors. Even though
    it may seem very technical, only by breaking the rules can you achieve a perfect
    bitmap.\r\nFor someone who's used to working with vectors, it demands a lot of
    flexibility on the designer's part.\r\nAt least, that's my experience\u2026"

    me that your Bold is three pixels heavy. Did you make one that was two pixels

  body: "I admit I got a little sloppy at the end; I just used the same swashes for
    the mini-version as I did for the regular which obviously makes the balance shift.\r\nThe
    3-pixel bold was a deliberate choice since I wanted to make a bigger contrast
    than I could do with only 2 pixels. It looks more like a black version now & I
    might rename it later if I decide to include a 2-pixel bold as well. For the mini-version
    I did however reduced it to 2 pixels 'cause the dimensions of the characters would
    have to be to stretched too much to fit in the 3 pixel strokes. \r\nFor the lc
    u I'll probably try to find another font that has doublesided serifs on the u
    to find comfort in. I actually like the way it looks & think it fits well with
    the other characters, but if it's just 'not done' I'll probably be too insecure
    to leave 'em the way they are. Any other thoughts and opinions on this would be
    appreciated.\r\nI'll do a 3-pixel ascender version of the regular in the next
    few days (have to do some other stuff I shifted forward to finish this first)
