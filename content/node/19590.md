  nameplate [was: masthead] of the New York Times, I wondered if any of you typophiles
  probably could help me find more sources and maybe also give me some more facts.\r\nHere
  is what I found out until now: \r\nThe masthead looks basically the same since 1860
  (see <a href=http://www.nytstore.com/ProdImages/NSPD1_large.jpg>http://www.nytstore.com/ProdImages/NSPD1_large.jpg</a>)\r\nWho
  made the original design and when? Is the nameplate [was: masthead] based on a historical
  blackletter face that I could not find yet?\r\nThe masthead was redesigned by Ed
  Benguiat in the late 1960s (anybody knows the exact date?), and since then it has
  been altered and simplified (I could not find anything specific on who/when, yet
  I can see that the spacing has been loosened, contrast between thick and thin lines
  has been increased, and the scrolled terminals have been straightened).\r\nAny hints
  are greatly appreciated!"

    come out of the woodwork and say "NO, I did!" This almost caused a fistfight (Ed
    B. vs.  Jim P.), at Type90 in Oxford, so, that's all I'm gonna say. Ask The Times,
    they'll give you the "official" story?

  body: "Thanks for the terminological clarifications - as a non native speaker I
    was appearently mislead following some of the misuse cases of \"newspaper masthead\".
    Regarding my research: I thought that there had to be some research been done
    already (though I did not suspect the subject would have approached causing fistfights),
    that's why I asked in the first place. And my topic is not the NYT nameplate itself
    (no danger of me saying \"I did!\"), but a book cover that was designed to resemble
    it:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JT_4067.png]\r\nThe e, h, r, s are
    drawn accurately after the NYT nameplate of the 1960s. Any more hints (apart from
    that I should ask the Times?) on the specific nameplate this was designed after? "

  body: A couple of years ago, I was at a talk Benguiat gave at FIT, and he mentioned
    that his redesign of the New York Times nameplate was to drop the period -- he
    also mentioned that the paper lost about 1,000 subscriptions when that happened!

  body: "The date of the elimination of the period was: February 21, 1967. \r\n\r\nFollowing
    is the text of an extensive ongoing document - it's almost a blog - by \"Character\"
    on the subject of the NYTimes nameplate. He posted this update a little earlier
    today. It includes a timeline of changes. Copies of all the referenced nameplates
    can be found in the on-line archives:\r\n\r\nVERSION 7 May 2006\r\n\r\nHere is
    my standard text on the subject (with some input from Dick Margulis):\r\n\r\nFONT:\r\n\r\nFrom
    \"Facts about the New York Times\", which used to be available as:\r\nFacts_About_NYT.pdf:
    \ A version now available doesn't include this information (and I never saved
    the version with this quote).\r\n\r\n\"The New York Times logo [known as the Nameplate],
    which appears at the top of the page, is hand-drawn, copyrighted and cannot be
    reproduced without permission.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nameplate was first created about
    150 years ago and consisted only of the letters actually used. \r\n\r\nTherefore
    there is no official matching font. \r\n\r\nThe nameplate itself has undergone
    numerous modifications since then, and its alphabet has expanded by other usages
    in the newspaper and its corporation.\r\n\r\nThe closest generally available full
    font appears to be \"English Towne\". However, the variations between this and
    the actual logo are unsubtle and numerous - missing diamonds on the thin verticals,
    a different termination on the minuscule \"h\", major differences in the minuscule
    \"e\", horizontal connectors on the majuscule \"N\", etc. About all that could
    be said is that it has the same general \"feel\". Every now and then you'll see
    someone state that \"Becket\" or \"Becker\" is the font, but even a cursory glance
    shows that this is absolutely nothing like it.  This was a comment that someone
    posted years ago and the internet has preserved for posterity.\r\n\r\nA complete
    version of English Towne, enhanced by Dieter Steffmann, can be viewed and downloaded
    from typoasis \r\nhttp://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm\r\n\r\nA
    truetype font was created by an unknown author, consisting of ONLY the letters
    in \"The New York times (T, N, Y, h, e, w, o, r, k, i, m, and s), as they appeared
    in the 1990's. \r\n\r\nHypoTypo extended the font by estimating the remainder
    of the lower case letters (NewYorkTimesEnhanced.ttf).  Of the a, g, n, and z that
    are in the word \"Magazine\", Hypo's guesswork was superb for the a, g, and n,
    but not the z. That font, with a half-dozen uppercase characters and a full lower
    case, is available.\r\n\r\nI have been slowly (VERY slowly) working on creating
    a more complete font, including characters from the sources shown below.\r\n\r\nHISTORY
    OF THE NAMEPLATE\r\n\r\nLogo Timeline\r\n1851 Sept 18  New-York Daily Times, Volume
    1, Number 1\r\n  2 Different Blackletter logos used, one for the large Nameplate,
    and a different one for smaller nameplates on the same page.  Day and date appear
    on each page in blackletter, which is how it will appear through Jan. 14, 1894.\r\n1857
    Sept 14 Name changed to The New-York Times; different lettering \r\n1884 Jan 6
    Changes to nameplate - most noticeable on the N, r, and s\r\n1894 Jan 15 Changes
    to nameplate - Major revision in the overall look; Date no longer blackletter.\r\n
    \ Note-The changes are not reflected on that day on the masthead on the editorial
    page.\r\n1896 Dec 1 Hyphen removed from New-York\r\n1914 Dec 30 - Beginning of
    a subtle change to the tail of the \"h\"\r\n1967 February 21 Major redesign of
    the logo by Ed Benguiat; period removed, Date now in all-caps italics.  All characters
    changed - lines made thinner, T gets a diamond instead of a caret, Y is expanded,
    and more.\r\n\r\nThere were five additional characters introduced with the word
    \"Magazine\", based on the cover of the Sunday NY Times Magazine section (M, a,
    g,  z, and n). The magazine's nameplate also introduces varieties of the \"e\"
    and \"i\" that are different from the corresponding letters on the front page.
    In fact, if you look closely at \"The New York Times Magazine\", the e's in \"The\"
    and \"New\" are different from the e's in Times and Magazine! The differences
    are in the small straight line spurs. The letterspacing differs between the front
    page \"The New York Times\" and \"The New York Times\" as it heads the magazine
    section.\r\n\r\nSince its acquisition by the New York Times, The International
    Herald Tribune has used exactly the same typeface; this adds the characters H,
    l, d, b, and u.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times Style Magazine was introduced August
    29, 2004, adding S,y, and l to the alphabet, and introducing an alternate display
    \"T\", created by Matthew Carter.\r\n\r\nIn September, 2005, a feature called
    \"The Talk\" was added to Style Magazine. This currently provides three lower-case
    words in each issue, in the same NYTimes blackletter. But there are some subtle
    differences; the e and o, for instance, have lost their spurs.  Thus far (as of
    May 7, 2006, after eleven issues) these letters have been included:\r\na, b, c,
    d, e, f, g, h, i, j, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and \xEF (i-diaresis).
    \ Some additional upper and lower-case letters may be inferred from issues of
    the paper prior to 1894, when the date was displayed in the same blackletter.\r\n\r\nIn
    the 1920's, at least the Rotogravure picture section of the sunday paper was labeled
    in matching Blackletter. For example, a section for Sunday, April 22, has the
    following texts in matching blackletter:  \"Sunday, April 22, 1923\", \"The New
    York Times Rotogravure Picture Section 5 In Two Parts\". \r\n\r\nOther newspapers
    that use apparently identical faces for their mastheads are The Des Moines Register
    and The Charlotte Observer, which uses a modified version. The Chronicle Journal
    of Thunder Bay, Ottawa, is somewhat similar, and may be used as a basis for the
    \"J\". But the I in The Seattle Intelligencer's nameplate is almost identical
    to the \"J\" in the Chronicle's! The Naples (Florida) Daily News' nameplate is
    similar to the original (1860's) NY Times nameplate.\r\n\r\nA book, \"The Paper\",
    about the New York Times, used NY Times-style blackletter for its title. The P
    has been incorporated into my version of the full font - still a work in progress.
    There are small differences between the \"a\" in \"Paper\" and the \"a\"s in \"Magazine\".
    There's a significant difference between the \"p\" and the \"p\" as seen in the
    Style magazine's \"The Talk\". \r\n\r\nOn February 21, 1967, the logo masthead
    was changed.  Significant changes were made to the T, k, and s, and to the M,
    a, and z from \"Magazine\", and a period after \"The New York Times\" was eliminated.\r\n\r\nSummary:
    The following characters can be authentically represented by having appeared in
    The New York Times or affiliated publications:\r\n\r\nUpper Case\r\n   D, H, M,
    N, P, R, S, T, Y\r\n   Multiple varieties of some of these.\r\n\r\nLower Case\r\n
    \  All but k and q.\r\n   Multiple varieties of some letters.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER
    INFORMATION\r\nThe New York Times running text font, called Imperial, used to
    be set at 8.5 point on\r\n8.8 point. They changed (9/18/94) to setting it at 8.7
    point on 9.6 point\r\nto aid legibility. Imperial was designed by Edwin W. Shaar
    in the 1950s\r\nand adopted by The Times in 1967.  (Scott Tilden)\r\n\r\nA December
    13, 2003 facelift made the following changes:\r\n   Headlines:    Cheltenham,
    as redesigned by Matthew Carter\r\n   Text:         Imperial\r\nSection Titles
    (regular sections):\r\n                 Bookman Headline\r\nDaily special sections:\r\n
    \                Memphis\r\nSome Sunday sections:\r\n                 Franklin
    Gothic EF\r\n\r\nSomeone said \"Engravers Old English\" is the closest existing
    font to the NYTimes masthead. It's not even close.\r\n\r\nFrom Dick Margulis:\r\nInteresting
    story about the New York Time logotype. You may recall that\r\nit included a terminal
    period until  February 1967.\r\nAt the time they dropped it, they issued a news
    release asserting that this one change\r\nwould save them some large number of
    tons of printing ink per year. (I don't pretend to recall the number, but it was
    something astonishing.)\r\nThat was incidental to the reason for the change--they
    were trying to\r\nspruce up the appearance a bit and made other changes as well,
    although\r\nnothing so radical as their recent introduction of color to the news\r\nsections.\r\n\r\n(From
    the NY Times on-line Timeline)\r\nDecember 1, 1896\r\nUntil December 1, 1896,
    the Times followed an older precedent by hyphenating New-York.\r\n\r\nTuesday,
    February 21, 1967\r\nThe top of the front page is redesigned. \"What has God re-wrought?\"
    \ asks a letter to the editor. \"No period in the New York Times masthead? No
    tittle to your title? The weather unboxed? 'All the News' restyled?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
