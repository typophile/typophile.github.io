  body: Hi, Gavin! <BR> <BR>I really like your idea for this typeface. But I also
    think that it might benefit from some more design rules and/or consistency. <BR>
    <BR>For example, the first five lowercase characters have slopes that go in different
    directions &#40;some slope on the top and the bottom, others only on the bottom,
    still others only on the top&#41;. The first five uppercase characters all have
    horizontal bottoms and they slope upwards from left to right topside. Were these
    deliberate decisions? Because it looks as if the first few lowercase letters were
    part of one idea, and then you decided on another idea for most of the uppercase
    letters... <BR> <BR>I would try some things out before moving on. For example,
    you might want to try sloping everything in the same direction, or even having
    two sets of fonts, one with all of the characters sloping up from left to right,
    the other with the characters sloping down from left to right... &#40;To see an
    example of this last idea, check out <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=453&amp;dw=350"
    target="_blank">Bronz-Smart</a>... you&#39;ll need to see it in the typesetter
    window to see how the two sets of alphabets work together&#41;. <BR> <BR>To paraphrase
    Ilene Strizver, your font can be consistent, or it can even be consistently inconsistent,
    as long as you made that design decision consciously. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to
    see where this goes!
