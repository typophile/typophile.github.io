  because the site won't work with IE 5.5. (It gets stuck in a loop after registration.)\r\n\r\nI
  can't get the font from FontHaus because they sell (but don't list) TT on their
  site and want to charge me extra to buy via fax or mail.\r\n\r\nI tried FontShop,
  but there are no scroll bars that I need to navigate the site. Strangely, their
  European and Australian sites don't have that problem, but I can't read German,
  and the prices are higher than $123.\r\n\r\nAnybody know where I can purchase and
  download TheSans Office?"

  body: "Elena, thanks. I did email them, and they have been very kind. I'm sure Luc
    & Co. are honorable people, but it makes me nervous to do the currency conversion,
    write a check, mail it to Germany, await its receipt, and then wait for an email
    with a zip attachment. It's more convenient, safer, and faster to use a credit
    card and then to get an immediate download.\r\n\r\nStephen - I got to that page
    before. No scroll bars on any pages on that site in my browser, and (therefore)
    the registration page can't be filled out. I sent you an email with a screenshot
    to illustrate the problem."

  body: A friend of mine has an old PC running Windows ME, and Firefox works just
    fine on it. You won't need a new computer or a new OS. Just a few minutes to wait
    for the download and install process to be finished. Then, you should be able
    to buy just about anything from just about anybody.

    theft was going on, after a 20 minute wait, the person can't help. Against policy.
    Then I get another email asking how my \"experience\" with my latest transaction
    went. Of course, the problem didn't fit the form, so had to be \"other.\"  No
    reply, after 2 months. Thank God Ellis Island messed up grandpa's name; there

  body: "Ouch, Charles. That should never happen.\r\n\r\nIn regards to Steve's issue,
    I understand his frustration. He is probably able to access most sites without
    issue. Roadblocks like this one are unexpected. But these roadblocks will become
    more common as his browser ages. \r\n\r\nIE 5.5 (released 7 years ago) sees the
    web much differently than modern browsers. Whenever a company updates their site,
    decisions need to be made about what features to include, some of which will disable
    compatibility with older software. In the end, the convenience of the vast majority
    of customers takes precedence over the smallest minority. \r\n\r\nIn FontShop's
    case, less than 0.1% of our visitors use IE 5.5. We make the (sometimes painful)
    decision to serve our largest customer base first, putting resources into more
    modern technologies, and then look to comply with least common browsers as time
    permits.\r\n\r\nThis is why <a href=\"http://www.webstandards.org/\">web standards</a>
    are so vital. Standards-compliant web browsers should have a longer lifespan than
    those that are not.\r\n\r\nAll this said, keeping your software updated will always
    save you time and headaches in the long run. I echo the calls for using Firefox
    and keeping it up-to-date, which is surprisingly simple."

  body: "Stephen, I do understand that sooner or later I'll get a new computer with
    all the bells and whistles, but right now, mine works just fine, never had a virus,
    and get's me into 99% of sites where I want to go. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, FontShop
    Australia and those in Europe do not have the incompatibility that FontShop USA
    has, and apparently MyFonts and Phil'sFonts have designed their websites to be
    friendly to new AND old browsers.\r\n\r\nLucasFonts not only won't work with my
    IE 5.5, but but I've been told (but I can't verify) that that it doesn't work
    with Macs either.\r\n\r\nI appreciate Charles Ellertson's comment, because it
    puts the focus BACK where it belongs -- on the foundries and vendors. Those who
    would rather blame the \"victims\" than take responsibility will just lose business,
    or at least mine anyway, which is as it should be -- just as it is with the US
    auto industry."

    what you are telling has little to do with compatability of websites with browsers.\r\n\r\nTrying
    to access new websites that use fairly new technology with obsolete ancient browsers
    that do not support it, and complain when it does not work, is a whole different
    story all together. :)\r\n\r\nNo offence to anyone."
