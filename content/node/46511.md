body: "I was playing MGS4 this weekend and my typophile senses were tingling. \r\n\r\nDuring
  the in-game conversations between the main character and a remote character the
  text of the conversation would be shown on screen. \r\n\r\nIt looked great on my
  TV and I wanted to know what it was. The most unique thing was the slanted stroke
  under the eye of the \"e\".\r\n\r\nAlso, it looks like a rounded sans in the screen
  grab, but I'm not entirely sure it is.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CloseupMSG4txt_6074.gif]"
