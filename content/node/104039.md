body: "A friend's son and his bride of six months are buying their first home. In
  an honored tradition associated with this life passage, he is clearing all his high-school
  and college junk out of his mother's house. Among the books headed for donation
  to the local library, I spotted this slim monograph, Arthur Okun's <em>Equality
  and Efficiency</em>, and it stirred up a memory of my first grownup job.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Okun_6653.jpg]\r\nFrom
  1974 to 1978, I was a customer-service rep at Garamond/Pridemark Press, a now-defunct
  Baltimore printing company with its roots in a print shop founded by Norman T.A.
  Munder in 1878. One of our steady clients in the 70s was the Brookings Institution,
  whose director of publications, Roland Hoover, was a fine amateur letterpress printer
  (and later became University Printer at Yale). \r\nBrookings used to have its monographs
  set metal by the Monotype Co. in Baltimore, printed at Garamond/Pridemark in runs
  of about 1500 on 60# Warren's Old Style. Sometimes we would even print them directly
  from the type on a big old Miehle letterpress that was still in commercial use at
  that time.\r\nThis copy is the 20th printing, but the copyright date is 1975, and
  it has all the earmarks of the books Roland Hoover did at Monotype: Electra text,
  with Dwiggins' cursive, not the italic, and Perpetua headings. I'm pretty sure the
  first printing of this book crossed my desk."

  body: "After nearly 40 years, I'm not 100% certain they used the Monotype Co. for
    this job, or what machines Monotype Co. had. Monotype Co. wasn't the only typesetter
    that Brookings used, but most of their work was set in metal. It was often printed
    offset from repro proofs; the place I worked was the only printer they used that
    could still print 16-page forms on a letterpress.\r\nSome of Brookings' economics
    publications were dense with equations and tables, and they invariably set those
    on Monotype machines. This particular example has no equations or tables in it."
