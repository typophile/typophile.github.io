  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear Typophile.

I need a typeface that is free to install on many computers, so everybody in the office can use it. I see that Google's Roboto is under "the apache license" - http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto#eula.

I'm unsure if that means that they're allowed to use Roboto as their main typeface.

Do you know?

Other than that, you can do anything you like. Unfortunately, open-source licenses aren't any shorter or less boring than proprietary licenses but I'd give it a quick once-over just in case.

		<div class="commentbody">Richard Fink, that's incorrect. The SIL OFL has the OPTION to restrict the use of 'upstream' names, and while it is almost always used, it is optional. In my personal opinion Google is likely to use that option if it asserts a trademark on the name. Perhaps it does, I don't know. 


Chester, yes they can use Roboto as their main typeface; however, since the font is under active development, you'll want to make sure they stay up to date with the latest and greatest versions (and keep in mind that this may reflow their documents. I also note that it seems to me that no official release has been made, only an early copy bundled with a programmers toolkit for development/prototyping by programmers - and that version has been spread all over the place, like to FontSquirrel. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Haha Sii :) I personally like and promote 'release early, release often'; my work to fund ttfautohint was driven by me wanting to remove a real and practical hinderance to doing so, since for as long as hinting is required for web fonts to be broadly useful, and hinting remains an expensive and hand-made piece of post production, then this way of designing isn't all that practical unless you have deep pockets - or like to do hinting ;) However, plenty of people have been complaining about the first publicly available version of Roboto, and I think its important to be aware of this in the context of choosing it as a house style type.

Thank's for the correction. If I am, or was, indeed, under the wrong impression about the Apache license. Or are we not talking about the Apache license?
I lose track, quite frankly.

You mean somebody else besides me complains? Well, certainly not about Roboto.
It's fine with me. But here, I've lost track again - what's hinting got to do with it?
