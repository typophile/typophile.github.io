  wordmark and logo for critique. The client loved the wordmark and has approved it,
  but I would still like to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\nI'm new here and hope to post
  more work in the future. Thanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NBP_4417.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NBP2_5564.png]"

  body: Are you referring to the birds? I'm not sure how I feel about them, but the
    client is pretty adamant that they be included. I think it is a decent idea in
    theory, I just hope it doesn't look corny. Perhaps one should be a bit smaller,
    like the rings in the wordmark.

  body: I didn't read them as birds to begin with not till I saw the comment. I don't
    think that the top logo with the huge k e r n i n g is that effective. You have
    high kerning in everything. Tighten up the letters in nicole brown. Also, I don't
    know if I would go with both of those n's. I like one because it is unique two
    makes it look repetitive and they are not quite the same so its a little weird.
    I would also make the rings just a tad thicker than what they are (I don't feel
    like they would communicate in a 1inch x 1inch space like a good logo should.

  body: "thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nI agree about the rings, they should be a
    bit thicker. Interesting note about the kerning; the 'nicole brown' is kerned
    very little, if at all. The typeface (Novarese) is naturally loose, and that coupled
    with the modified 'o' could be leaving things looking too spaced out."

  body: I think you can do away with the italicised "n" on the logo. I'm not so sure
    about the birds. Maybe just a simple circle?

  body: 're: ratbaggy''s sentiments, I''d try simplifying. the ''rings'' idea works
    best and reads quickest, so focus efforts there. the other ligatures are distracting.
    like the colors.'
