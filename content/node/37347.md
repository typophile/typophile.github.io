body: "I'm writing and designing a book set in Adobe Caslon. I've had to add characters
  and diacritics (mostly diacritics, double acutes, etc.) to make it a very extended
  Latin set.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for assistance to refine what I have done in Fontlab.
  All the characters are there in one weight (all I need), but the set needs a skilled
  hand to complete the job. A few of my characters are a bit, uh... wonkified.\r\n\r\nThe
  book will be published by Oak Knoll and it's currently being edited.\r\n\r\nI can
  run it by the publisher, but I'll probably end up having to pay for the work out
  of my own pocket. So, funds might be an issue and I have no idea what something
  like this should cost. Regardless, full credit will be given to the designer.\r\n\r\nI'm
  keeping the topic of the book a secret for now as its publishing date isn't known
  yet.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested or if anyone can recommend someone, please post
  here and we can continue correspondence off of the forum.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n-
  Theo"
