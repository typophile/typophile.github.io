  body: "It seems like the counterspace of lowercase a look smaller than counterspace
    of e and other. The base serif of uppercase L and lowercase u look bigger/ bolder
    than other, tend to draw my attention to it right away.\r\nCounterspace of Uppercase
    R look heavy. Overall, everything come together very nice and unity. \r\n\r\nCan
    you tell us about what you trying to achieve for this typeface? I'm just curious.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think this is a fantastic start. I agree that the counters in the \"a\"
    and \"e\" seem to not be balanced in relationship to each other. I'd suggest making
    the bowl of the \"a\" larger to more closely resemble the \"e\".\r\n\r\nI really
    like the x-height though. I think that you're working it into a good direction
    if your goal is for a solid typeface set in small sizes. I would be careful though,
    of having the x-height too close to your uppercase height, they could potentially
    bleed together. I'd also watch the height of your small caps. Having them between
    your x-height and uppercase height would make them more traditional and set apart
    from your other characters."

  body: "First of all, thank you, guys!\r\n\r\nanhng: The overall idea is to create
    a cheerful text face, for magazines and newspapers, with loosing it's seriousness
    and robustness. In order to do that, I wanted to create a slightly calligraphic
    typeface, smooth and idiosyncratic.\r\n\r\nkentlew: Maybe it should. how can I
    move it over there?\r\n\r\nchronicle: I wanted to make a horizontal bar on the
    \"a\", I recognise that it isn't tuned with the e. Do you think that small caps
    are to tiny?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    do it yourself, unfortunately. Either a moderator can, or I'd suggest you might
    just start a new post in the appropriate Critique section.\r\n\r\nThen maybe edit
    your original post here to note that you've started a critique thread and post
    a link to that node to steer any future comments over into the Critique section.\r\n\r\nI
    just think you'll get more responses, since that's where people who love to comment
    on stuff tend to hang out more."
