    'catastrophe' from unraveling. \r\n\r\nThe letters on STREET signs in the USA
    are different from Interstate signs. \r\n\r\nAs you can see comparing Chris' photo
    of the STOP sign with this sample of Interstate. \r\n\r\nI think this has come
    up before and the font used by municipalities is some special font for stamping
    out signs. There may be imitations out there, but not Interstate or any of its
    cheaper cognates. "
