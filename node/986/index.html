<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Searching for methods to understand easily the process of typeface production for a good thesis, i found some stuff but i want to call to typophiles to your personal "Mystique" for creating good work from the beginning to the end. <br> <br>I mean you can have a good idea for a typeface design, but without a process... or thinking about contribute...with a thousand mediocre free fonts around here will be good to know the importance of the process behind a good typeface. <br> <br>I found a good Factory Tour of the House Industries in the Idea magazine from Japan on is number 281, page 73. <br> <br>They are seven steps <br>> Concept Development <br>> Research <br>> Planning <br>> Layout <br>> Work Development <br>> Copyright <br>> Final Production <br> <br>What do you think about this? <br> <br>MH. <br> <br> <br> </div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I think Mystique and Method are opposed. Formality impedes instinct. Just drawing your font takes care of all that "concept development" and "research" stuff (assuming you're not just reviving/remixing something that already exists). On the other hand, doing research into things like readability is useful as a foundation - that any many other things (like exposure to the work of others over time) implicitly guide your drawing anyway. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm perhaps crazy, but I dont use that at all. I just open FontLab when I have five minutes between to others type jobs, or when watching TV on a good chair... and draw some new glyphs for a current typeface in dev. <br> <br>Then, couple months later, a new family is done. <br> <br> <br>If I think a bit more, all the process you describe happen in some way, but in quite destructured way, during my dreams for example. <br> <br>Anyway I need to stop now, I'm busy right now, I have a meeting with my dreams in couple of minutes, bonne nuit... :-) <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Miguel, I would suppose a lot of that has to do with <br>whether the face is being commissioned (as so many good <br>ones are) or whether it's going to become a pet project of a <br>"serious hobbyist" (as so many good ones are). <br> <br>Since your purpose is academic, I'd think you would benefit <br>from focusing on the commissioned side, where a client <br>would hand the designer/foundry a list of requirements <br>and/or desired attributes and/or research. <br> <br>[Dang, those are two very fine run-ons. Look out Jon.]</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with jfp. Eventually, new typefaces just sort of "happen." Of course whatever method works for the designer is the right method.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Miguel <br> <br> <br> <br>In idle moments I more or less "write" letters with a soft (4B) flat sketch pencil. This is a habit of a lot of years of comping layouts in pencil. In the early days, a person developed a representative sans and a roman etc. that could be used in a layout, and substitiuted for almost any typeface that was decided on in the production process. <br> <br>I save all the doodles, and go through them from time to time to find out what I think will work as a type. <br> <br>The scale I work at mostly is about a 3/4 to 1 inch x- height. Once I have cut in with a fine point to delineate the forms. <br> <br>People work in many different ways. Whatever it takes to get there is good if it works for you. <br> <br>Jim Rimmer <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Dear H?ctor, <br> <br>one of my teachers ones told me , after I asked him 'how can I explain people, why we need new typefaces', typefaces can be like cars. There are cars for every purpose you can think of and still, they always can be designed better. <br> <br>You should try to think of a purpose/task, which your typeface should fullfill. Then you'll probably have enough to research about. <br> <br>For example: </div>
