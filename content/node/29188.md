  case I have just taken Eurostile and quickly moved the anchorpoints a little bit,
  but the principle is that the most left vertical stem is always the thinnest, a
  little bit strange.\r\n\r\nAre there fonts like this around that you know of? Good
  and/or bad.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hoens_4246.png]"

    does the Spongebob cartoon show. Then there's the venerable Adlib.\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/9243\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
