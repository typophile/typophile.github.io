  a font sample useful for evaluation?\r\nWhat sizes, layouts, arrangements give you
  the information you need on which to make informed commentary?\r\nWhat statements
  do you hope to read when designers submit their designs for critique?\r\n\r\n(Posted
  here since it's as close to a Forum Advice column as we have, though so far not
  very close at all.)"

    more you have, the easier critique."

    that's a keeper. (The other one too, but I knew that one already :-)\r\n\r\nDunno,
    I'm partial to samples that have a large showing of the base alphabet (at least
    as long as it's being intensely worked on \u2013 later on in the process, a smaller
    one showing the entire character set should be more useful); and I strongly agree
    that text fonts should include actual sample text at actual target sizes. When
    evaluating alternatives, both/all should be shown in context.\r\n\r\nFor the text
    setting: Maybe the best idea would actually be to show both the target language
    of the font and English*; while the former can show the desired texture, and how
    the font deals with language-specific peculiarities like diacritics, the latter
    can give most people in here an impression of how it reads.\r\n(* Assuming it
    is a Latin font.)"

    a respectful nod to the venerable\r\nand still highly useful \"quick brown fox\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
