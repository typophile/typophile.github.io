body: "I'm trying to write a script that checks the compatibility of glyphs before
  generating a MM font.\r\n\r\nI wrote this which works for single glyphs \r\n\r\n<code>\r\n========================\r\nfrom
  robofab.world import OpenFont\r\nlightFont = OpenFont(None)\r\nboldFont = OpenFont(None)\r\n#\r\n#\r\nprint
  lightFont.info.fullName,\"/\",boldFont.info.fullName\r\n\r\nprint lightFont[\"A\"].isCompatible(boldFont[\"A\"],
  True)\r\n========================\r\n</code> \r\n\r\nI really wanted to do it with
  a loop, and loop through the whole font. \r\n\r\nI tired this, but it gives me a
  list saying all the glyphs are compatible but I know they are not. \r\n\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n========================\r\nfrom
  robofab.world import OpenFont\r\nlightFont = OpenFont(None)\r\nboldFont = OpenFont(None)\r\n#\r\n#\r\nprint
  lightFont.info.fullName,\"/\",boldFont.info.fullName\r\n\r\nfor glyph in lightFont:\r\n\tprint
  lightFont[\"glyph\"].isCompatible(boldFont[\"glyph\"], True)\r\n\r\n\r\nprint lightFont[\"B\"].isCompatible(boldFont[\"B\"],
  True)\r\n\r\n========================\r\n</code> \r\n\r\nI changed the outline of
  the \"B\" and tested the compatibility after the loop and it tells me they are not
  compatible but the loops tells me they are \r\n\r\nHow can I loop through both fonts
  and test there compatibility ?"

  body: The only difference between the chunk of script I posted and Paul's is that
    you don't have to call a particular glyph called glyphName each time but you just
    have to refer to the item in the font.keys() iterable. So no '' in the square
    brackets.

  body: "That should teach me never to post code without testing it... :)\r\n\r\nIndeed
    folengo is right, there should be no quotes:\r\n<code>\r\n> lightGlyph = lightFont[glyphName]\r\n>
    boldGlyph = boldFont[glyphName]\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nI just tested the script with
    two of my own files and it works fine here - it happily reports any incompatibility
    errors.\r\n\r\n-Paul van der Laan\r\nwww.type-invaders.com"
