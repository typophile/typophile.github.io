body: "I picked up a copy of  John Mullan's <em>How Novels Work</em> (OUP) in a bookshop,
  and thought the text face was surprisingly pleasant and readable. I wondered what
  it was, as none of the Bodoni and other \"modern\" (in the classification sense)
  faces I have on my computer really work for sustained text.\r\n\r\nI didn't buy
  the book (I don't buy books just for the typeface any more) and I haven't been able
  to find a downloadable image, but you can look at extracts from the book on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0199281785/ref=sib_rdr_ex?ie=UTF8&p=S00P&j=1#reader-page\">Amazon</a>
  and <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ubvNf_U-Qu4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=how+novels+work+john+mullan&ei=XDzPS_e_MormzASC9ZHSAg&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false\">Google
  Books</a>.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"

  body: "Two of the Miller packages on myFonts are discounted right now. I wonder
    if that means there's an Opentype version coming? \r\n\r\nIs that how it works
    or are they just encouraging me to use my credit card again? If so, they were
    successful. \r\n\r\nIt's definitely Miller in the Google book link you presented."

  body: "Thanks for the identification \u2013 and for the news about the MyFonts discount!
    I'm increasingly impressed with FontBureau's work, not least the digitisation
    of one of my favourite book faces for the Linotype system, Juliana."
