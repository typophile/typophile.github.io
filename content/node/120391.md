  body: "<strong>AmourTendre</strong> designed by Jacques Bertrand\r\nAccording to
    the following site the font is \"Postcardware\" but I think the download link
    results to an old (ancient) Mac \"bin\" file format:\r\nhttp://www.erik.co.uk/font/serif.html\r\n\r\nMore
    info on the designer from Luc Devroye site:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/longdesigners.html\r\n<blockquote>Jacques
    Bertrand works in the Department of Psychology at the University of Trois-Rivi\xE8res,
    Qu\xE9bec, Canada. He designed the Mac fonts Amour Tendre, Bertrand, Jean Camil,
    Nancy Blue, Petit Bonheur, Provence, Puccini and Steinbeck (Mac only).</blockquote>"
