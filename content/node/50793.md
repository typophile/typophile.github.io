  available for Mac.\r\nI want to go through the basic basics of font design for my
  graphic design students. It doesn't have to be subtle of even all that precise,
  but I'd like my students to come up with a very rudimentary face (UC, lc, numerals
  and punctuation) that they can convert to a Mac font quickly.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Typetool is about as simple as it gets. <em>However\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nTwo
    years ago, when I was a design student trying to figure this stuff out, I thought
    starting with Typetool would be a good idea. I quickly decided that it was actually
    a nightmare. Because I\u2019d already been using Illustrator for years, I found
    something missing every time I turned around in Typetool and ended up doing a
    lot of work in Illustrator and then bringing the vectors into Typetool. Eventually
    I just caved in and bought Fontlab. If you decide to go with Typetool, run through
    all of the exercises yourself first to be sure that it\u2019s not too simple. "

  body: You could give [[http://www.fontconstructor.com/index.html|Font Constructor]]
    a try. It's VERY simplified, designed for modular font design. You would have
    to export the resulting fonts to a more powerful program for refinement, but one
    can hammer something out pretty quickly with this.

  body: "Chuck, \r\n\r\nTypeTool 3 is built on the core of FontLab Studio 5, so you
    can design professional-quality retail-ready fonts that will have the same industry
    strength as fonts built by major font foundries. Also the user interface concepts
    are closely related to those of FontLab Studio, but simpler. \r\n\r\nNote that
    if your academic institution purchases 8 or more TypeTool licenses, the cost will
    be about US$35 per workstation. See http://www.fontlab.com/buy/academic/ for more
    information. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontconstructor.com/ and http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/
    are completely free but follow a different model. Rather than drawing lettershapes,
    you build them from blocks and elements. Also, the output quality of those tools
    is \"draft\", so while the fonts made with those products may work in most operating
    systems, there is no guarantee that they will perform well. \r\n\r\nFinally, http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/
    is free and opensource but it's rather complex and the learning process is not
    trivial. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
