  Any similar alternatives that don''t have all the associations/aren''t system fonts?
  I used to be good at this but I''m drawing a blank. '

    name (on paper, if spare skin not available)? After all, this is lettering, not
    typography, and a typeface should really only suggest a general style or starting
    point. Besides, it is doubtful that the lettering will be an exact rendering of
    the typeface.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps I am wrong, and tattoo artists work as mere technicians,
    going over a printed temporary decal or some such thing\u2014I\u2019m not familiar
    with the state of this art.\r\n"
