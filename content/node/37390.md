  to know what is the typeface of the L and V letters used in the pattern.\r\nThe
  logo \"Louis Vuitton\" is easier to recognize for me: futura.\r\nHowever,this one
  is a difficult one. \"L\" is italice, but \"V\" is none. Could it be also a very
  classical typeface or it is a special design by the designer?\r\nDoes anyone have
  any clue about it?"

    were drawn.\r\n\r\nSo, for how much are you going to sell your counterfeit bags?
