  body: "The |S| in particular closely resembles any number of sign painter scripts
    from House Industries and others, but I can\u2019t find a match to all the letters.
    \r\n\r\nThis style is also prevalent in graphic novels/comic books, so looking
    at one of these sites might be helpful:\r\n\r\nBLAMBOT\u2014http://www.blambot.com/\r\nCOMICRAFT\u2014http://www.comicbookfonts.com/"

  body: "Good find Dick.\r\nThis is a very peculiar font.\r\n1. No legitimate source
    that I can find. I checked the contents of some of the ones floating around as
    \"free\" fonts with internal copyright by Enstep\r\n2. The matching letters are
    a thickened and horizontally expanded distorted  version of a lighter weight font
    which survives in the parts of the font devoted to accented letters and letters
    beyond the 26 basic letters, and which could be recreated as a full font. Some
    bizzare results are the dots on _i_ and _j_ that overlap the stems and look like
    dotless letters with bumps on top.\r\n3. Almost all of the Unicode numbers are
    incorrect.\r\nDon\r\n"

    a perfect restoration of the font expanded and widened to make Abyss, but a fair
    approximation. Note the details that pop out, such as the dots on _i_ and _j_.\r\nI
    wonder what font that might have been?\r\nDon"

  body: From looking at other Enstep fonts on the web they seem to have altered other
    peoples stuff (fatter, slanted etc) and issued them. The majority seem to be not
    well realized and often ugly.
