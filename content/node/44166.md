  styles. I don't want the typical, ordinary ones, which are on everyday Word.. I
  want some original and unique styles of lettering. I am in need of them soon, because
  I need to start my collection right away. I am very excited about this! I am not
  big on collecting, but One has to start somewhere. I would appreciate anyones help
  that they could offer me! Thanks so much,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                     Tiffany

  body: Collecting? That word has negative connotations around here. Do you mean you
    want suggestions for sites from where you can license some great type?

  body: ' I never done this before, nor  have I been on this site. To be perfectly
    honest I needed some typeface styles for T- Shirt designs. If you would be willing
    to explain the proper way to come about those; then I will proceed in that fashion.
    I have been putting this off for a while and I am now trying to do so. Nice to
    meet you Miss Tiffany and hope to converse with you further. Thank you.'

  body: Tiffany, you can quite easily find some amazing fonts for license all over
    the internet. What is your budget and what style are you hoping to start with?

  body: "Tiffany, if you are just starting out and don't really have a budget to speak
    of you can always find some useful free fonts. The best place to start would be
    Typophile's <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14652?\">Typowiki entry about
    free fonts</a>.\r\n\r\nBecause you've said you are new to this I will say that
    it is important to read and understand any EULA (End User License Agreement) that
    is part of all (99%) of fonts available whether for license or shareware/freeware.
    Some of the free fonts you might find, for instance, might not allow usage on
    commercial projects. \r\n\r\nGood Luck!"
