  most of this year and it's hard to get good feedback when you're on your own. \r\n\r\nI'm
  working on a logo/identity for an Ag Management company. I've been playing around
  with the usual earth, sky, sun icons and wondered if anyone may have a different
  angle. \r\n\r\n"

  body: '"Agricultural management" is a pretty broad area. Can you be more specific
    about the focus within AM, descriptors about your client (geographic location,
    customers, technology, business and social philosophy...), what your client feels
    makes them unique in the industry, and what image they want to convey?'

  body: "They service local farms in the midwest [IN, OH, MI, etc] that range in sizes
    from 1000-4000 acres. They equip the farmers with GPS software that enables them
    to plant and fertilize fields more effectively using satellite data and even soil
    analysis.\r\n\r\nI'd say their customer service makes them unique along with the
    technology. Willing to help the local farmers. As far as image... anything is
    better than their current logo so that's wide open."

  body: "IMHO, in the ag industry, the logos that really stand out are the ones that
    have a strong wordmark.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's a field of blues and greens and
    cows and tractors and corn stalks."

  body: "I am really drawn to the circle with the \"grain motif\" this has a historical
    reference.\r\nThe top one on the right with the script is elegant.\r\nThe san
    serif bold Nester centred or to the right, merge the old and new.\r\nFarming being
    the traditional and the GPS being the new.\r\n\r\nJust a simple designers thoughts
    from Calgary."

  body: "I like the arcs as well. To me it could represent the big horizon farmers
    see. I think if you removed one set of drops, and then angled the others to the
    horizon, it might strengthen that look. \r\n\r\nThen I would look at playing with
    color/gray to change one of the outer dots, or a row of dots, to provide the idea
    of satellite's sending down information.\r\n\r\nDon't know if any of these would
    work, but I would play with them."
