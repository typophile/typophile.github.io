  body: "I tried too, and I found only two that were very similar: CAC Pinafore from
    the American Greetings Create-A-Card sets, and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/freedom-writer-bf/\">Freedom
    Writer</a>, from Bomparte's Fonts.\r\n\r\nThe looping t was the most oddball feature.
    I'm inclined to think it is a custom font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\n\r\nThank's for your reply! Your finding are quite close but
    still not the right font. I'm sure it's not a custom either. Here yu can see a
    logo made with the same font and the sample I took: \r\nhttp://themeforest.net/item/reflex-dynamic-grid-portfolio-blog-theme/261288?ref=epicera\r\n\r\n-

    own custom font that the rest of us can't get, whether they designed it, or had
    it designed for them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
