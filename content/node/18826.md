  body: ">I\u2019m looking for books, links or anything else about the relationship
    between font and the technology used to design type\r\n\r\nEvery serious book
    or website that deals with type design can't help but talk about the relationship
    between type design and the technology used in both the design of the type and
    the rendering of the text set in it. So your question is very open-ended and therefore
    difficult (or easy) to answer. Posting it 4 times won't help :-(\r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si"

    error message might causing him to try several times. I had to open a new browser
    tab to make sure this posted. (I'm editing this post now.)\r\n\r\nHaving said
    that, take a look at the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/wiki/Books\">Books</a>
