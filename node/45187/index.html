		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure, but firstly I don&rsquo;t think Quark has the functionality to import Indesign files. Furthermore, even Indesign has problems importing Quark files unless they&rsquo;re saved as version 4 files in Quark.  Why an Indesign file won&rsquo;t open from PC to Mac I can&rsquo;t be certain other than with possible PC vs. Mac font issues.  Are the two versions of Indesign on the Mac and PC the same?</p>
<p>Sorry I can&rsquo;t shed any further light.</p>

I have enough headaches with InDesign - like it condensing graphics brought in - will not let me see whole graphic &ndash; too busy expanding it to fit area rather than give me my entire photo&hellip; etc. etc. - oh wait, my favorite - not allowing me to change color of type. Must quit out, wait about 10 minutes, go back in and then it allows it&hellip; very quirky - more so than Quark ever was.</p>
<p>But&hellip; if you need help right away maybe these time savers can help you: Could you try to save it as a PDF - and then open you can bring it to any computer - and import the &ldquo;graphic&rdquo; into Quark.

<p>InDesign does not seem to have upgraded its ability to import Quark files, which is very frustrating. It was enormously helpful to me when I was learning InD that I could open Quark files into it. But alas no more.</p>
<p>I have never known Quark to be able to import InDesign files. And Jackie, I haven&rsquo;t had your sorts of problems with InDesign either. I have my own gripes with InD (lack of kerning tables, the fact that there is no key command for Text Frame Options as Quark has, the completely retarded Links pane - why do you have to manually update each image when they are all in the same folder???)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Ricardo -</p>
<p>As the production side of my brain says &ldquo;get the job out now&rdquo; I always look for the route around - may not be the fastest &ndash; but it gets the job out. Then I&rsquo;ll, if I get the breather, reinstall.</p>
<p>In the case of InDesign - I&rsquo;m still on CS1 because I cannot justify spending money to upgrade. The client that insists I use it &ndash; has now found a new bone to pick&hellip; I wrote about it here earlier. Seems no one has noticed a &ldquo;trapping&rdquo; problem. I just received a printed proof &ndash; I hadn&rsquo;t a clue what they were talking about &ndash; then hubby pulled out a loupe to show me. He also commented, &ldquo;Do they give a loupe to every person who buys a book from this series.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So first they picked on me to get InDesign, and now I think they are picking on me to give the work to the printer. Just my regular NY paranoia&hellip;</p>
<p>and Ricardo, you should see me pick apart the RGB PDFs that come in for reproduction &ndash; fun fun!</p>

<p>I find that annoying too. If there are a lot of images to update which live in the same folder, what I usually do is update one of them, save the document, and close it. All the remaining links will be automatically updated once the document is reopened.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Re the links pane:
I have to say that I don’t know what you’re talking about. That is, I vaguely recall some inconvenient behaviour in the past. But with ID CS3 (v5; on OSX.5), I haven’t experienced such problems:
When the .indd-document resides in the same folder as the linked files, I can move the folder and won’t have to update any broken links. When the .indd sits somewhere else and I have moved/renamed the links folder, I have to update merely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> link. The rest is fixed automatically. I don’t know how you can improve on that.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->the fact that there is no key command for Text Frame Options as Quark has<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>What can you do via these Quark Text Frame Options? Just curious.

<p>Florian, maybe what you&rsquo;re talking about is a feature of CS 3 which I have yet to install. I will be installing it soon tho, just ordered a new MacBook Pro! Quark&rsquo;s equivalent of Text Frame Options is called Modify and it&rsquo;s essentially the same thing, but accessible by a simple command + M, rather than going to a drop down.</p>
<p>Paul - command B doesn&rsquo;t give me the window I want. I am talking about the window &ldquo;Text Frame Options&rdquo; under Object. The pane that lets you make columns or center text in a window - or ignore text wrap. But yes, I do use the Quark key commands - that&rsquo;s the only way I can work in InD. I used Quark for about 15 years before I learned InD and trying to un-learn it would have been a nightmare.</p>

This might also help resolve PC to Mac issues, although I have not tried it. Of course, any new functions not supported in the older version will be disabled and might mess up your files in surprising ways. 
In my opinion, InDesign CS3 is worth the money. It handles transparency much better. If you are still working with Illustrator CS, an upgrade to the new Creative Suite 3 will give you some amazing new color tools.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.markzware.com/id2q/">www.markzware.com/id2q/</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only used the Quark to InDesign plugin in both CS2 &amp; CS3 (Quark 6 originals), saved a lot of time on a certain project which out weighed the cost. Imports all style sheets, guides etc. As usual remember that nothing is perfect, you&rsquo;ll definitely have to watch out for any manual kerning and double check that all styles sheets are working as intended. At the end of the day a lot quicker than recreating multiple documents.</p>
