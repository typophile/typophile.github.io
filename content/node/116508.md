    classical antiquity or is it a modern building?\r\nDon"

    So not a modern building, :). '

  body: "I have not been to Pompeii but I did take in the traveling exhibit of preserved
    treasures from Pompeii including frescoes from some of the houses. Fascinating.
    As for the lettering we are looking at a provincial interpretation of the lettering
    we often call Trajan. There are many modern versions, but for a substitute for
    your inscription I sort of like Classic Roman Light MT http://www.identifont.com/find?font=classic+roman&q=Go
    The link includes references to very similar fonts which also work as substitutes.\r\nDon"
