body: "Hello lads\r\n\r\nFirst time posting on this forum. \r\n\r\nI am currently
  refining a logo for a jewellery company\r\n\r\n[Brand background]\r\n\r\nTTF is
  a jewellery brand in China specialised in designing their own jewellery and is currently
  gaining international notice from Switzerland Jewellery Show and Gem Fair. As it\u2019s
  gaining more popularity in the jewellery industry internationally, the client would
  like to have its brand identity and logo re-designed in order to fit in with the
  international market.\r\n\r\nThe original logo \u201CTTF\u201D is very boring. However
  it\u2019s a registered trade mark, so unfortunately it cannot receive major modification.
  In order to add more to the brand ID, the client decided to include the word \u201Cdesign\u201D
  by the TTF logo.\r\n\r\nOriginal logo - a tad bit boring and my job is to refine
  the design. \r\n<img src=http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6129/5939115685_25e485d2e3.jpg></img>\r\n\r\nCurrently
  there are 3 design proposals. As I have mentioned above, the TTF is a registered
  trade mark, which leave me with little room to tweak, so I can only work on the
  font and small details. It would be awesome if you guys could give me some C&C.\r\n\r\n1:\r\n<img

  body: "It's a bland but sturdy logo. Adding the little embellishments is making
    it messier and then tacking on of 'design' is awkward. None of the accoutrements
    integrate well and they'll all suffer when reproduced at different sizes.\r\n\r\nI'd
    suggest moving away from the original TTF in your experimenting. You can always
    come back to it, but spend some time rethinking it entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> Original logo - a tad bit boring \r\n\r\nNot only boring but also inappropriate
    for the company's product; it could be a logo for a company that makes machine
    parts. \r\n\r\n> it\u2019s a registered trade mark, so \r\n> unfortunately it

    to use the same logo forever; most companies revise their logos periodically,
    sometimes in very major ways. \r\n\r\nBut anyway, most of those variations you
    show will not reproduce well in smaller sizes, especially the tiny diamond. Try
    making prints of those logos postage-stamp size and see how they hold up.\r\n\r\nIf
    the client just wants tweaks, you might consider leaving the letter shapes alone
    but maybe reverse them out of a shape (an oval or jewel shape or whatever) and
    then soften the overall look through the use of color."

  body: "Thank you for your kind reply guys. \r\n\r\nThese feedback really helped.
    As JamesM suggest the original TTF logo is indeed very inappropriate for a jewellery
    company, it's very unfortunately that I am current stuck with it. \r\n\r\nI've
    made further changes to the logo in order to counter the sharp and heavy font

  body: "I think that new approach has possibilities, but a few suggestions. The word
    \"Design\" is very tiny in most of them and won't hold up well in small sizes.
    I would probably put \"Design\" outside of the shape (as you did in one of them)
    and make it larger. \r\n\r\nConsider putting Design in a more feminine font (perhaps
    a nice script) as that would be a way to counterbalance the corporate look of
    TTF and soften the overall look. \r\n\r\nYou also might want to consider using
    softer colors, more like pastels.\r\n\r\nAs for the specific shape, I dunno, that's
    just going to take a lot of thought and experimentation. A shape with curves will
    help soften the logo, although a hard-edged jewel shape certainly might be appropriate
    too.\r\n\r\nAs research you might want to search \"jewelry logo\" (or similar
    phrases) on Google Images to see example logos of other jewelry companies. "

  body: I like the diamond shape (blue). wonder if you played with the shape a little
    more so it looked more diamond'ish. diamonds come in all shapes/sizes.  =) [img:sites/default/files/old-images/diamond_shape_3631.jpg]
