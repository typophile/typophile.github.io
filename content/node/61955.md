  body: "Hi,\r\nIf it was done without the computer, i'd say you've got sure hands
    and good teachers ;). \"I\" stands out so you might have a strong personality...
    It makes me think of comic books and cats, don't ask why.\r\n\r\nTo be honest,
    it took me a while to figure it's a script font, the first suspect is \"I\", give
    it one more alternative and i'm sorted. Other thing is \"you\" \u2013 contextual
    alts give same glyphs in same exact words, pity you cannot switch it to \"random
    alternatives\", could be nice for script faces.\r\n\r\nWhat is it's intended use
    ?\r\n\r\ncheers!"

  body: "Hi Inni, \r\nthanks for the feedback, this is better than seeing an astrologer!!!
    cool\r\nActually I had some wonderful teachers,and as for the hands..others' opinions
    are always more truthful.!!\r\nThe I's do have some variation, separations on
    the vertical at the bottom, at the top, no breaks and a regular one...four at
    the moment.They are used according to a few variables. The variations might not
    be so obvious in the picture, but it does show 3.\r\nI can adjust it to give more
    variety in the y's and the ou ligatures. I think its more obvious because of the
    passage that Ive chosen as an example but I take your point.\r\nAs for the intended
    use, purely personal use or if anyone would want to buy it that would be great
    too. As for the reason for doing it...\r\nOne to get a true handwriting font,
    and secondly just as a labour of love...this is my first font, and self taught.\r\n\r\nGlad
    you like it though.\r\nKindest regards\r\nNeil"
