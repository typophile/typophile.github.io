  two that I've seen used on invitations & the like: Meiri (<em>e.g.</em>, [[http://www.stitchesbysue.net/id114.html|this

  invitations).\r\n&emsp;(Actually, that's not entirely correct; I've seen the occasional
  modern script or Vilna-like \"standard\" print or even Hadassah, but those two fonts
  are well-nigh universal.)\r\n&emsp;Are there real alternatives?&ensp;Readable, but
  also more decorative than would be used in a <em>siddur</em>.\r\n&emsp;(I have my

  body: "Another very attractive decorative Hebrew font was \"Yahalomim\" or \"Diamonds\"
    offered by FontWorld (www.fontworld.com) a number of years ago. I understand that
    it together with other popular Hebrew designs are being converted into the new
    OpenType font format from Adobe and MiscroSoft.\r\n\r\nIt was marketing originally
    in Israel by Letraset in the eighties as a stick-down letter. As computer-based
    typesetting replaced the old fashioned the stick-down letter based typesetting
    of traditional graphic artists. I do nit know who was the designer, as often Letraset
    of Israel simply purchased the designs from Israeli graphic artists, and unfortunately
    did not acknowledge their creative contribution in their products.\r\n\r\nAnother
    popular decorative design offered by FontWorld was the \"Bar Mitzvah\" Hebrew
    typeface design."

  body: "> and Yerushalmi (like here, or this example:\r\n\r\nJCSolomon,\r\n\r\nYour
    brother's invitation is truly beautiful. May you have much happiness from him.\r\n\r\nNow,
    let's critque. \r\n\r\nFirst, I agree that there is a dearth of decorative Hebrew
    typeface designs, although this one is beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe final chof in the
    3rd row, and the 14th letter from the right, is poorly designed. It is over weighted,
    both on the horizontal thicker top, and the vertical narrower right side. This
    is either a font software glitch, or a design error.\r\n\r\nAfter careful inspection,
    also in the top row, and the 15th letter from the right, the final mehm is also
    poorly weighted. Again, this is either a font software glitch, or a design error.\r\n\r\nI
    suspect that this is sloppy work at the font production level. Perhaps, the font
    maker/programmer poorly scanned the images of the aleph beis, and neglected to
    touch up these defects in the font, because he or she either lacked the \"eye\"
    or skill, or was lazy.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the kerning, you will see also that
    there is no kerning, as certain letter combinations are closer than others. Kerning
    is a lot of tome consuming work, and the talent to properly kern is not woth every
    talented type designer. The OpenType font technology can incorporate a table of
    finely kerned letter pairs on the font, producing perfect work.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    I would strongly suggest to reduce the size (perhaps a point size) of the English
    text to better match the Hebrew. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is hardly a matching
    English font for Hebrew calligraphy or a pseudo-calligraphy invitation font. Notice
    that both the slant and the sub-conscious eye-movement goes from right-to-left
    in Hebrew, but in English  font for Hebrew calligraphy or a pseudo-calligraphy
    invitation font. Notice that both the slant and the sub-conscious eye-movement
    goes from left-to-right.\r\n\r\nSoon, I will create a few matching sets of well
    kerned OpenType Hebrew and English fonts so birthday, bar-mitzvah, and wedding
    invitations can be printed happily, and we can enjoys fully these simchas (milestone
    events).\r\n\r\nLet me conclude, we can always find fault because everything created
    lacks perfection. Considering the tools out there, your brother's invitation is
    stunning.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Bottom line, there aren't any Hebrew fonts that I know about that even come
    close to the calligraphic invitation fonts that we are used to in English. \r\n\r\nI
    think the reason for this is that the way Hebrew is written is so fundamentally
    different to that of English, that the creation of flourished script create a
    completely different result. \r\n\r\nWhen dealing with block letters, you can
    put certain fonts together relatively successfully such as David with Times (although
    I personally hate both of these fonts), or occassionaly you'll find a Hebrew font
    such as FBOptimum that matches perfect with Optima, but in general, I don't try
    and match any more.\r\n\r\nWhen creating my own wedding invitation, I had to tone
    down the complexity of the English font (I think I chose Brioso) so that I could
    find a complimentary Hebrew font."
