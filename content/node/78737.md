  the website of the company http://www.emm-camping-car.com/ we can find only this
  small color image\u2026</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/EMM_gauche_haut.jpg\"
  /></p>\r\n<p>\u2026that allows to guess that the baseline \"Europe Mat\xE9riel Maintenance\"
  (that reminds Triplex) is in the same font than \"EMM\" (the M looks similar despite
  of its microscopical size) (it was more obvious on the printed document that i had).
  Unfortunately there is nowhere on the site any bigger logo.</p>"
