body: "Hey a fontlab newbie question here.\r\nI have opened two two fonts names frutiger
  and Gill sans in fontlab to see their construction(cap height and ascender height.\r\nBut
  i noticed something different. while the cap height of frutiger is around 1400,
  but the cap height of gill sans is only 680. What is the ideal sizes(from ascender
  to descender)? i heard it should not be more than 1000? and also what happens if
  it is more than 1000. I didn't see any problem with frutiger.\r\nThanks\r\nTypogruffer"

    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant

  body: These fonts have different em unit definitions. My guess is that the Frutiger
    you are looking at is a TrueType version with a 2048 unit em, while the Gill Sans
    is a PostScript version with a 1000 unit em. The measurements of e.g. cap height
    are relative to the em, so in fact the Frutiger and Gill cap heights are almost
    identical.

    body: "@John and Hrant: Thank you \r\nNow just to make things more lucid, suppose
      i define \"unit em\" like 1500(i.e. from descender height to ascender height)
      and try to make a font. what difference does it make. What i mean will my 12
      pt size be similar to the Frutiger 12 pt  and Gill Sans 12 pt.\r\nHow is this
      size(1000 or 2048 or anything) actually define the length of your font(at various
      point sizes). How am i getting approximately the same length(at 12 pt) for both
      these fonts even though their height is so different while making."

  body: "And/but looking for an \"ideal\" is misleading. Although in the past (as
    John's comparison helps reveal) there was more of a \"pseudo-standard\"* in terms
    of vertical proportions, these days we see more freedom there. Any \"ideals\"
    are more like general guidelines (which don't even always apply): make the caps
    shorter than the ascenders; make the descenders shorter than the ascenders; let
    the cap accents float a bit above the top limit.\r\n\r\n* And within a given foundry
    (like ATF) often a strict standard.\r\n\r\nAs for the 1000 issue: it's a legacy
    limitation... which does not however make it totally irrelevant.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "No matter how many units your Em is it gets scaled to fit in the \"real\"
    size. So 12 pt type will always fit in a 12/72 inch space... BUT \"fit\" does
    not mean what you might expect, since parts of a font (like the cap accents) can
    actually go over the upper or lower bounds (and it's the bounds* that are made
    to fit within the point size); also, you tend to leave some talus (AKA \"internal
    leading\") above the ascenders and below the descenders too.\r\n\r\n* Which BTW
    is not the same thing as ascender + descender...  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The em (also called the body height) is what is scaled, so it represents
    the height that will equal 12pt when the font is set at 12pt\r\n\r\nUnits per
    em defines the grid on which the outline is defined. The PostScript standard prior
    to OpenType was 1000 units per em. Most TrueType fonts were traditionally 2048
    units per em. but this was not a requirement. In OpenType, either flavour of font
    may have any positive integer number of units per em, but for legacy and compatibility
    reasons 1000 is still recommended for PostScript OTF.\r\n\r\nThe ascender-to-descender
    height is often close to the em height, but that is not a requirement either:
    some fonts are 'cast small on the body', and a few may be taller than the em."

    body: Thank you and your reply is very clear. I never knew about this scaling
      factor. But at same point sizes, some fonts appear Bigger and some smaller.
      Is it attributed to the difference in X heights? or some cheating(which i have
      know clue about), Hrant was talking about

    region.\r\n\r\nCaecilia: I guess I remember wrong; I thought its ascenders and
    descenders overshot the Em bounds (which is what I'm calling \"cheating\"). But
    here's an example I'm sure of: at some point sizes the bitmap renderings of the
    old MS Core Fonts exceed their nominal point size* (ascender to descender).\r\n\r\n*
    I mean factoring in the 96/72 business.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Differences in size between fonts at the same nominal size may be either apparent
    or actual. I would consider actual size differences to be differences between
    the ascender height and descender depth relative to the em. So, for instance,
    Monotype Perpetua is a type that is cast small on the body, i.e. the ascender-descender
    height is notably shorter than the em, and hence shorter than most other fonts.
    Apparent size difference is most likely, in Latin type, to be a result of difference
    in x-height and letter width, independent of the ascender-descender height relative
    to the em.

  body: "Relative to the em, there is more variety in x-height than in cap height.\r\nFor
    obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nSo, because in U&lc text x-height is more indicative of
    apparent size than cap height, one does see clear differences in apparent size
    between different typefaces\u2014at the same point size\u2014even though, were
    their x-height to be equalized (by varying point size) and text compared, they
    might look the same size."
