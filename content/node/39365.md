  - a new brazilian type foundry - is proud to announce the release of <strong>Adriane
  Text</strong>. <a href=\"http://typefolio.com/Adriane_Text_Specimen.pdf\">PDF here</a>\r\n-\r\nAdriane
  Text was designed between 2006 and 2007, and with \r\nits core objectives to become
  an adequate text composition \r\nand characteristics, it can be classified as a
  transitional typeface. \r\nHowever, details in its anatomy offer a certain personality
  that \r\nwithout it, it becomes excessively visible, in addition to an \r\nexcellent
  legibility in small sizes. The typeface has a medium \r\ncontrast and the axis is
  predominately vertical. The size of \r\nx-height counter forms gives an extreme
  legible effect applied \r\non every typographical composition. \r\n\r\nAdriane Text
  acquires two styles: regular and bold; with its \r\nrespective italic versions,
  small caps, tabular and proportional \r\nfigures in old style and lining, an extensive
  set of ligatures for \r\ndifferent combinations, as well as ornaments, \r\ndingbats
  and several ampersands. \r\n\r\nIts italic version possesses fluidity that contrast
  with \r\nthe severity of the roman special characteristics in its drawing. \r\nThe
  degree of the italic inclination between the upper and \r\nlowercase are only slightly
  different, but offering \r\nmore rhythm to the text.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the use
  of advanced typographical projects, \r\nall font types are accessible throughout
  the OpenType features.\r\n\r\nMore about <strong>Adriane Text</strong> <a href=\"http://www.typefolio.com/adriane.htm\">here</a>"
