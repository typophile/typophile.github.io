  body: Thanks Lex. The 'AJK' in your user pic - that's a modded Avant Garde too,
    right? Have you got a link for that font?

    Fontshop</a> to buy Avant Garde or its alternates.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I used Avant
    Garde in my picture. I don't have the alternates, so I made my own 'A' out of
    an 'N'.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
