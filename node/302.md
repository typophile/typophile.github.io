  body: Well, the all-caps sans is Avenir. <BR>But I think you&#39;re probably looking
    for the <BR>serif one, which I can&#39;t tell what it is. <BR>That Y makes me
    tempted to say it&#39;s a custom <BR>alphabet for this logo. <BR>If you could
    get us a bigger sample, it would <BR>be very helpful. ;-&#41;

    <BR> <BR>I am looking for the serif face. It does look custom, but wondering which
    face it&#39;s based on or a face that closely resembles it. Thx in advance. Here&#39;s
    a big larger logo.

  body: I did a full run on the &#39;Serif&#39; section of the FontBook,  <BR>but
    that revealed nothing. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not so sure about the Book-Antiqua/Palatino
    lead. <BR>Your sample is more fluid, less squarish than Zapf&#39;s type.

  body: Looks like Augustea &#40;by Butti &amp; Novarese for Nebiolo, 1955&#41;, with
    a little redrawing of the N.
