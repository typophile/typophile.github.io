I don&rsquo;t know how it compares to renting a flat, but it is one of the most affordable University owned accomodations. The best part is that it was inhabited by a diverse range of students, most of whom were enrolled in graduate programs. Part of a University education is being able to meet and learn from other students who have experiences and backgrounds different from your own &ndash; which Hillside provided.</div>

The downside is that you have a loooong walk to get to the department : )

<p>So my advice would be, buy some comfortable shoes and start off with Gerry&rsquo;s reading list as soon as possible!</p>

(i guess i&rsquo;d prefer that option - i couldn&rsquo;t stand a catered room!) as far as i have seen the prices are pretty much the same.
long walks are no issue for me as i&rsquo;ll take my bike there - but gerry&rsquo;s reading list might be an excellent idea!</div>

No brokers fees and what not, and you can find roommates on that page also. I&rsquo;m in Sherfield, and enjoy the nice bike rides in the morning, but if you are part time, two years of a hall would be a bit much. Yes, start on Gerry&rsquo;s reading list and start brainstorming ideas for your dissertation!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I stayed in Sherfield and it was great. It is generally accepted as the best at Reading but the priciest. Still, I found it worth the extra money. It is self catering, and it has a computer room (you won&rsquo;t find internet connection in the rooms except via dial up).  The Junior Common Room is great with lots of nice activities (quiz night, pub crawl, xmas dinners&hellip;) and the rooms are ok. Also, we had cleaners come and clean our rooms once a week, and the kitchen everry weekday. Seeing the long reading list you have to go through, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to waste time cleaning your room.</p>
<p>Also, the way it is situated, you get lots of socializing happening in the kitchen that you share with 7 other people. I had amazing friends there&hellip;</p>
<p>It is 25 minutes walk away from the typography department. 40 minutes from the town center. Not so convenient but it&rsquo;s worth it. Still, it was close to the sports center on campus (8 minutes). It is around 1.5 hours away from St. Brides in London where you will be spending a lot of time&hellip;</p>
<p>A very popular restaurant is Katmandu Kitchen on Christchurch. Ask for the Chicken Dry Fry with Pilau rice and Pashwari naan. mmmm.</p>
<p>Since you are staying for 2 years, you might want to first stay in a Hall (definitely self catering though) and to move out later.</p>
<p>Best of luck for next year&hellip; I am jealous :)</p>
<p>By the way, an amazing book is Creative Lettering Today by Michael Harvey. I would start reading there. Type Sign Symbol is a good start. Also, Gerry&rsquo;s recommendation to me as a first book to read was Counterpunch. All good books. Enjoy&hellip; Last time I checked the list was 7 pages long.</p>
<p>Hint: learn how to properly type set a bibliography, it will come in handy. Also, would be good to start practicing with a broad nib to get the feel of letters.</p>

<p>Mmmm indeed. I&rsquo;m very fond of the Katmandu Kitchen and always manage to arrange to eat there at least once when I am in Reading. Some of the Nepalese dishes, which all seem to include fruit, are interesting and not typical &lsquo;Ruby Murray&rsquo; fare. Last time I was there I had a mild curry with lychees in it. To be honest, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t order it again, but it was good in a horizon-expanding way.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you decide for one of the University&rsquo;s Halls, don&rsquo;t make the mistake of choosing a fully-catered room. Not only it is twice the price of a self-catered one, but also because the food choice is not worth of the difference (too much fried food for someone used to good fresh fish, like me).
Besides, you would have to follow their very strickt mealtimes, and find yourself wasting money on meals that you couldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;attend&rdquo;, or running back and forth to the department/hall to be on time for lectures/meals (and I&rsquo;m not even accounting the queueing time&hellip;).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m staying in Bridges, right next to the department, in a self-catered room and I quite like it. The JCR (Junior Common Room) fee, that every student has to pay (40 pounds/year), covers for lots of things you can use and do, including tennis court, pool table, TV room with cable channels, music room, computer room, newspappers, DVD movie nights, bar quiz, karaoke, etc.
ASDA, a big supermarket, is not far. It&rsquo;s also very cheap, and groceries for a whole week (breakfast, lunch and supper everyday) hardly cost over 25 pounds.
The kitchen is fully equipped with 2 stoves (with oven), fridge, freezer, microwave, toaster, boiler, cutlery, crockery and individual cupboards.
The floor is shared by 12 students, mainly post-graduates. We also have a (very nice and friendly) cleaning lady that comes 4 times a week, to do the kitchen and bathroom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about it!</p>
<p>PS: In addition, this year&rsquo;s students are leaving a pair of top-notch tennis rackets as the legacy ;)</p>

<p>I stayed in Hillside – it was ok. 
Try to avoid the undergraduate student halls.
Sadly, life in UK isn’t as cheap as in Austria:
You should multiply your living costs in Vienna by 2 or 2.5
to get a realistic idea.</p>
<p>As for the reading list: There are titles 
which are important for the academic writing part 
and some which may actually help you for your practical.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you start with Walter Tracy: Letters of credit,
carry on with Fred Smeijers: Counterpunch 
and Richard Southall: Printer’s type in the twentieth century.
Read also John D. Berry: Language Culture Type.
If you want some advice on academic writing, have a look at
Umberto Eco: Wie man eine wissenschaftliche Abschlussarbeit schreibt.</p>
<p>Other books that might be useful are
Noordzij: The stroke of the pen
Harry Carter: A view of early typography
If you’re interested in Arabic type, probably also:
Huda Smitshuijzen AbiFaries: Arabic typography</p>
<p>Have also a look at:
John Hudson: Windows Glyph Processing. An OpenType Primer 
at 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/Glyph%20Processing/intro.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/Glyph%20Processing/intro.mspx</a></p>
<p>And: enjoy the course! I am sure you’ll like it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m part-time this year, so I&rsquo;ll see you in October!</p>
<p>I rent a private flat found through the university&rsquo;s website. Ben posted the link above; you may need to email them for a password. Halls wasn&rsquo;t an option because I dragged my partner and kid along with me. A few people on the course flat/house share and it seems to work out, for the most part.</p>
<p>Gerry posted a &lsquo;starter&rsquo; <a href="http://www.leonidas.org/html/MATD/resources/MATD_PrintResources.pdf">reference list</a> (pdf) on his website.</p>
<p>Look forward to meeting you :)</p>

<p>thank you so much for your help! by now i am  taking the halls as a reasonable option into account as most of you seem to recommend it.</p>
<p><strong>mike:</strong> a catered hall was never an option for me, as i love cooking and eating and therefore i am a bit choosy &hellip; ;) the bridges hall is also an option for me as it is so close to the type department and one of the least expensive solutions.</p>
<p><strong>wolfgang:</strong> thanks a lot, i&rsquo;ll contact you off-list.</p>
<p>do you know if [[john hudson]]&rsquo;s article also exists as a printable version? john?</p>
<p><strong>brook:</strong> i am looking forward meeting you! i suppose the halls are a bit cheaper than private rent, given the range of features included in the price. (?)</p>

<p>Friday nights were rough sleeping since the pub/disco with Robbie Williams &lsquo;Angels&rsquo; late.. last call keep you up and Saturday 9am lecture was tough to get to.</p>
<p>But fun&hellip; lots of late fire calls.. from Greek smokers&hellip; setting of the alarms!!!</p>
<p>They had big kitchens at the each end of the halls, 2 per floor. No catering so cooking yourself and big meals with all the foriegners everynight!!!</p>
