  the 1980s - though these fonts are probably much older. Perhaps neither of them
  are digitized, but knowing the name or some info on them would be great.\r\n\r\nThe
  first one resembles Metro but it is definitely not that.\r\n\r\nThe second looks
  like a French design or a take on Antique Olive - but more varied than it.\r\n\r\nThe
  third looks like a metal engraver font - and I bet that it has more weights, but
  I have only found this weight in the magazine.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and fifth are most
  probably some kind of old DIN (Deutsche Industrie Norme) standard faces - they were
  widely used in Hungary in print and on signs. The two are different faces (just
  note the differences in the uppercase J and the question mark). The fifth also has
  a bold weight.\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated!\r\nThank you,\r\nGabor.Recska\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontid1_3740.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontid2_4869.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontid345_3777.gif]"

    Zolt\xE1n Nagy too, the \"Sz\xE9les groteszk\" (Wide Grotesque) from the picture."
