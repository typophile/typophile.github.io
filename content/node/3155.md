  body: Not me yet, but I had a similar problem. The printer claimed to not be able
    to open the file properly and that there wasn&#39;t any font files.&#40; Which
    is rubbish because I included a pdf, id file and the fonts.&#41; Anyway, they
    hashed it and swapped Times NR for my specified Vendetta, claiming that it &#34;pretty
    much looked the same&#34;. I didn&#39;t know until it was printed, and was livid
    to say the least. <BR> <BR>kris.

  body: I don&#39;t want to get into a whole mac/windows  <BR>thing &#40;I use both&#41;
    but I find that many print  <BR>shops routinely port jobs over to the mac,  <BR>cavalierly
    substituting fonts, when they get  <BR>windows jobs, an ongoing frustration.

  body: I was at a print shop the other day, and was  <BR>hanging around in the pre-press
    department. <BR>They always got bad files &#40;designers think they <BR>know everything&#41;
    including PDF&#39;s. They had  <BR>software which could open a PDF in order for
    <BR>them to fix things. Even then PDF apparently <BR>isn&#39;t super-robust. <BR>

  body: One good,  ne excellent, reason to examine your own film. I&#39;m very used
    to doing my own film output, as we have the equipment in our offices.  <BR> <BR>Recently
    I had the press I use output the film for an oversized project and didn&#39;t
    think to examine the film. They gave me one of those new fangled digital proofs
    which I&#39;ve had ZERO experience with ... because again I&#39;m used to examining
    my own film and having the matchprints made directly from the film. I wasn&#39;t
    aware that the stairstepping was actually not a result of the digital proof but
    actually in my illustrator file. &#40;I am so used to outputting my own film and
    knowing what to watch for that I didn&#39;t know the red flags in this press&#39;s
    workflow.&#41; <BR> <BR>When I went in to discuss the problem with the pre-press
    department they told me point blank that the problem I had had wasn&#39;t something
    they watched for .... ARGH! The problem, was of course, the file not being set
    to a high enough resolution. I hadn&#39;t run into this problem in sooooo long
    it took me by surprise.  <BR> <BR>I call it a lesson learned. I don&#39;t know
    how to calibrate my film, or test the calibration of processed film, I trust someone
    else to do that for me. But I know bad type and bad shape and incorrect overprint/knockout
    when I see it.  <BR> <BR>More on topic, not many foundries support embedding into
    PDFs, let alone for service bureau output. But, those that do should be applauded
    and rewarded &#40;I don&#39;t know how&#41;.  <BR> <BR>One work-a-round that people
    should include to their service bureau ... laser proofs. Even if you just give
    them composite prints. I would think that they wouldn&#39;t want to give you film
    that didn&#39;t work if you can show them how you know it should look in the end.

  body: My experience with pdfs is more like Tiffany&#39;s. I wish I knew more about
    the issue  <BR>of support for embedding in pdfs. I often modify my font set to
    default to old style  <BR>figs and so on -- does this affect it? And yes, I always
    provide laser proof as well  <BR>as an admonition to the printer not to substitute
    fonts, but some will not believe I  <BR>can tell the difference until I catch
    them at it.
