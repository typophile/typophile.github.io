  few of my own:\r\n[[http://twitter.com/mattmc/statuses/3982149912|Zach ignored value
  and quietly jacked up the price of BMX wheels.]]\r\n\r\n[[http://twitter.com/mattmc/statuses/4106787008|I
  just need a wooden bracket and an inverted question mark of the same size to finish
  this xylotypographic print.]]\r\n\r\n[[http://twitter.com/mattmc/statuses/3982737067|It
  is extremely difficult to squeeze every letter of the whole alphabet into just a
  single f**king sentence.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nand a couple by Paul Hunt:\r\n\r\n[[http://twitter.com/pauldhunt/statuses/4089886302|Although
  quite rare, words like 'frowzy 'and 'jinxed' often get used in pangrams because
  they help use left-over letters.]]\r\n\r\n[[http://twitter.com/pauldhunt/statuses/4089789994|quick!
  somebody plz keep me from wasting any more time making jovial mixed phrases]]"
