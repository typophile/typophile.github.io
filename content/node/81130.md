  , the sample or details image uses a particular sans-serif font I've seen so many
  times, but for the life of me can't figure out what it is. I originally thought
  it was a FontFont font, but I scrolled earlier today through their entire online
  catalog w/a text sample \"work like\" and found no match.\r\n\r\nLowercase 'f' and
  't' have only half a cross-bar, and the lowercase 'k' is \"curly.\" Neither WhatTheFont
  nor Identifont were any help.\r\n\r\nThis font is like that song stuck in your head
  that you don't know the right words to, you know?\r\n\r\n<em>(solved - \"Sansation\"
