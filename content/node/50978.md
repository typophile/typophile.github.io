    I have painted in mine using oils, acrylics, gouache, pastels and inks. The standard
    sketch books don't take water colour washes too well, but you can get interesting
    effects with it. If you use water colour than I would recommend the Moleskine
    water colour sketch books, these are very good and each page can be torn out with
    clean edges if need to.\r\nFor pens I use pencil, uniball vision elite, and Inoxcrom
    ball point.\r\nHave fun."
