  two particular fonts,and I've finally come here. In the first picture,I'd like to
  know what the font is called that says 'Skatey',and in the second one the one that
  says 'Celebrate with us!' and is flashing. It'd be greatly appreciated if you found
  them for me! \r\n\r\n-Thanks in advance,\r\nChristopher"
