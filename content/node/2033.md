body: 'following some corpoarte values, namely &#39;alive&#39;, natural&#39; and &#39;wild&#39;,
  i came up with this logo, based on anime style. It&#39;s an element of  <BR>a style
  that i&#39;m working on called &#39;white occult&#39;. <BR>the logo has been launched
  now, and there&#39;&#91;s also a 3d version and an animated version too, but I&#39;&#39;ve
  posted it here since I feel i need to &#39;air&#39; it in a critical forum. Logos
  like these tend to be dffficult to critique since they have to be analysed in the
  context of competitors logos, the visual culture of the audience, and the internal
  culture of the company. however, i&#39;m interested in any negative/posative associations
  you may have, and since it&#39;s part of ongoing research, any typographic directions
  identifiable within logo design. Oh, in case you can&#39;t read it, we named the
  company &#39;ish&#39; &#40;www.ish.com&#41;. This work was done while working at
  an agency called Lucky. <BR><!-Attachment: ish_logo.swf-!><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD><IMG

  body: ' Miles, pretty interesting. I think with the various-sized &#34;thorns&#34;
    it will print well: the less the size/resolution, the more the small ones will
    drop out, but you&#39;ll always have some. The only thing that bugs me is the
    blue: to me it&#39;s saying &#34;ethereal&#34; more than &#34;earthy&#34;. I guess
    blue is their corporate color... Try putting some green in it &#40;towards the
    color I&#39;ve heard called &#34;petrol&#34;&#41;. I mean next time.  :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Legibility: if the nature of the company makes it so that its name is
    already in the user&#39;s mind when seeing the logo, it&#39;s great. But for first-time
    exposure you might like to make the &#34;s&#34; more curvy, and the &#34;h&#34;
    with a longer ascender and narrower body. <BR> <BR>BTW, the animated thing on
    the site is very nice! Seen that way, it definitely looks more animalistic. And
    a cool three-letter domain? They must be rich...  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; corpoarte
    values, namely &#39;alive&#39;, natural&#39; and &#39;wild&#39; <BR> <BR>Does
    the CEO dress up in bear skins?  ;-&#41; <BR>&#40;Maybe these days that&#39;s
    his cover...&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; &#39;white occult&#39; <BR> <BR>Nice. It&#39;s
    always great to have a cool name for a style. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    are true, I only hope that people learn to read it, however, the ad campaign is
    a pun on german words that usually en with &#34;isch&#34;, so it would be &#34;erot&#34;

    &#40;sp&#41; name.'
