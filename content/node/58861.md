body: "When I paste letter from Illustrator to FontLab (before that, I unite all objects
  into one) it goes everything well. When I generate font file and try it in Illustrator,
  on smaller size (8,10,12...till 20pt) some characters seem like they have too much
  points.\r\n\r\nThis is what do I get:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/linije_3493.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  every other program, when I type something with this fonts - same problem. When
  I convert to outline text in this font, those lines disappear.\r\n\r\nThan I go
  in FontLab and open some character with problem and it seems to be OK, I can't figure
  out what are problematic points that make those lines. I tried with:\r\nCorrect
  Connections, Join Broken Contous, Close Open Contours, Nodes at extreme and Optimize,
  but without any result. Also, I tried to copy back from FontLab to Illustrator and
  do again \"unite\" option, but still nothing happens.\r\n\r\nCan someone tell me
  what should I do?\r\nDo I need to clear every character step by step, or there is
  some less complicated solution?\r\n\r\nThanks"
