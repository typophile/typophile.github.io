body: "Hi all.. i'm working on a logotype, and Baskerville (Monotype cut) really has
  the perfect letterforms for my situation.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, i want to build
  something that feels more open, and where the x-height of the letters is taller,
  and the shapes of the characters generally closer to square, rather than thin rectangle.
  Same goes for the caps, I wish they were a bit wider - more square in shape.\r\n\r\nI'm
  wary of redrawing it on my own and bastardising Baskerville (see attached image
  for a quick mockup of what i'm thinking). Also, I'd like to use the same typeface
  for subheads of the logo (think: Entire Catalogue, Recruitment Services Division),
  and the client will be need to be able to set these on their own.. so a pre-existing
  typeface would be perfect.\r\n\r\nI really feel like there must be a face out there
  that fills this niche, but i'm not sure what it is.\r\n\r\nthoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-3_6681.gif]"

  body: "It has probably already occurred to you, but ITC Baskerville (aka \"Linotype
    New Baskerville\") has a larger X-height, and is closer to your illegitimate offspring.\r\n\r\nYou
    could check that, or maybe the Baskerville BE (Berthold-Adobe). There are a number
    of B'villes from Storm, too, but I've never used them."

  body: you are spot on - currently i'm toying with New Bskerville, although it's
    not as elegant as the Monotype cut, it has closer proportions to what i'm looking
    for..

  body: "There is something else that might fit the bill: <a href=\"http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/HendersonSerif\">Henderson
    Serif</a>, a Baskerville interpretation by Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez. It's a proprietary
    typeface, though, and never will be made available to the general public. So this
    addendum to the thread won't help Ben at all (in addition to being a few weeks
    too late), but I'll still think the typeface is worth a mention."
