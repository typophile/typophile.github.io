  this project to be a strong as possible and thought I would see if I could get some
  feedback from this great community.\r\n\r\nThis is the basic layout spread and typefaces
  I have gone with (Thanks Jos loving Museo).\r\n\r\nSorry the content is all filler
  but I am still waiting for the editorial, but wanted to get a jump on the inside
  layout. Please give me any suggestions and crits you have.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/layoutComp_5095.jpg]\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\np@"

  body: "I looks good...\r\n\r\nThe E in the first line has to be more to the left,
    to align with the rest of the text.\r\n\r\nI think the width of the text box is
    too wide. Also the 4th paragraph is way too long. I don't even wanna read it -
    it feels everlasting...\r\n\r\nBesides that - as I said - I like it... :-)\r\n"

  body: "I don't think it looks professional. Why? Here's why:\r\n\r\nI don't like
    the top and bottom green bars. Especially not the top one. And they also don't
    complement each other.\r\n\r\nText boxes don't have enough white space around
    them, hence unprofessional and unrefined look.\r\n\r\nLeading with this wide text
    column is too tight.\r\n\r\nImagery doesn't match in style even though presented
    as part of the same publication. \r\n\r\nAs said at the beginning. Looks like
    anyone could do it and as most wanna-be-a-designer would do it. Sorry. Don't like
    it at all. Golfers are usually richer people and this doesn't reflect this fact.
    This spread reminds me more of a church mass invitation than anything else.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: The colors work well for me, and the type choice too. But it's way too crowded,
    the slightly diagonal "Championship" just looks like a printing error, and (as
    mentioned) the differing styles of the golfball and the fairway at the bottom
    are very jarring.

    is what I am looking at now. \r\n\r\nReally would like to play with the white
    space more but at 5.375 x 8.375 and a limited number of pages it tends to get
    a little crowded at times.\r\n\r\nHere is an example with at least some of the

  body: "Ok. This looks much better. But if I were you I'd use some free photographic
    material instead of clip-art vector graphics. It will make it look more sophisticated
    and nice.\r\n\r\nIf space is a problem in that case I'd get rid of coloured edged
    colour bars because they tend to make content space even smaller and less breathable.
    I'd incorporate more organic shapes (softened photographic material may work nice
    if partially also in the content background) that will look nice.\r\n\r\nEliminating
    as many limiting surfaces you'll gain breathing space. BUT. Don't get tempted
    to make content any bigger because you won't benefit anything.\r\n\r\nYour layout
    is very full already. If you can't get through with decent looking brochure I'd
    suggest you convince your client to either cut down content or add more pages.
    Prepare some very good arguments (include some printouts that will look much nicer
    and convincing) so client will say yes to whatever you'll say.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: "Hmm...after looking at the design, considering it's for a golf championship,
    it looks elementary; almost like it's a pre-made template (sorry! no offense:
    ). Is this something the client suggested? \r\n\r\nWhen I think of golf, I think
    of sharp, crisp, clean lines, sophistication, rich greens, blues and golden browns
    with nice contrast. I also think of openness, no boundries, like that of a golf
    course. Your design seems restricted and too structured. I would suggest playing
    with the curves that you would naturally find on golf greens, sand traps, the
    ball, etc...Opening up the design, like Litera suggested will give you much more
    room to work with. I hope this helps...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I disagree with the above comment. I think that the design blends subtle
    curves and straight edges very nicely. While golf courses are  \"natural\" (is
    there anything really natural about manicured greens and strategically placed
    sand, trees, and water?), the game itself is very structured. The ball is perfectly
    round, the club is perfectly straight, everything is perfectly precisioned.\r\n\r\nI
    actually like the idea of the green strip at the bottom of the original image
    you posted. But have you tried making the strip asymmetrical across the spread?
    And what about doing the page-number ball on the even-numbered pages and a pin/hole
    on the odd-numbered pages? Hmmm does this seem too cliche? \r\n\r\nMy father has
    been design golf tournament collateral for years, so I might be a little over-zealous
    about this stuff.\r\n\r\n-S"

  body: "My overall feeling was related the initial openness of a golf course and
    how that could relate to the overall design. But, I can see where you're coming
    from as well sch2525. You could go both ways; it all comes down to personal preference
    :)  \r\n\r\nI would still like to see darker, richer colors...I think the drab,
    gray background is throwing me off.\r\n"

  body: "Hello again every, thanks again for the feedback. here is some new pages
    with the a few layout tweaks and some actual editorial. \r\n\r\nlitera: I agree
    and thank you for all your points. But, the look they where going for this year
    was a more vector look, all the tickets and such have a vector image of a golfer
    sort of silhouetted in solid colors. I tried to reflect that my own way with the
    dimples of the ball. I would love to work in more pages with the client but I
    work in the production world and I am given a set number of pages to keep the
    price of printing down. What the boss man says, I do.\r\n\r\nSorry aluminum but
    the client likes the golf balls so they ended up staying.\r\n\r\nOberlange and
    sch2525 I think you both make very good points for both ends, I played a bit with
    curves like you suggested but just kept coming back to the more structured look.
    \r\n\r\nWell thanks again and hope I am getting closer to something half decent.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/page39_6251.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/page44_5238.jpg]\r\n\r\np@"

  body: "Okay not much of a design comment but in your first comment two guys from
    my University (Auburn) are listed.  War Eagle!  (and also my undergrad school
    and rival to my current one, Alabama.... Roll Tide!)\r\n\r\nI like the colors,
    and most of the plays (all?) are from universities, the design matches very closely
    with standard university non-big-3 sports.  These are the colors I would have
    expected, I think the blue previously suggested would make it even more cartoonish.+\r\n\r\nI
    really like the texture you've given, as it nicely matches the dimples on a golf
    ball, ditto for the curved lines which make me think of wind.  It's a clean layout
    which is the image I get from golf players (who else makes sure their shirts and
    pants are ironed before they go out to play sport?)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es
