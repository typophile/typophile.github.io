  body: "Agreed. Also, your justified setting (on a relatively narrow column) will
    need more massaging to work/read comfortably; most of your wordspaces feel too
    wide, which feels awkward (\xABunique&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;childbirth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience\xBB)"

  body: A small detail, but I notice you have it all lower case but end with a period.
    My dictionaries either write their definitions as sentences (cap and period) or
    as phrases (all l.c. and no period).

  body: That non-kerning 'f' makes me thing it's an old Monotype font, which may not
    have been digitised. Still it's definitely worth posting in the Type ID forum.

  body: "Monotype could handle kerning f\u2019s, Ben; it\u2019s Linotype that could
    not. (Although, that doesn\u2019t mean that Mono always cut kerning f's. Often
    they did not. But that wasn\u2019t a mechanical limitation.)\r\n\r\nThis is most
    likely one of the relatively generic Old Styles, which usually went by just a
    number. Both manufacturers had plenty of similar faces in the genre.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d
    have to pull out my old catalog to identify which one. But it probably doesn\u2019t
    matter, because most have not been digitized. \r\n\r\nA few digitizations in the
    general category:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/old-style-mt/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/old-style-7/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/binny-old-style-mt/\r\n\r\nThe
    roman and bold would not necessarily have been part of the same family. The Old
    Styles generally date from a period before our modern concept of type family had
    fully emerged. "

  body: "It helps to have seen the two different machines in operation to understand
    what\u2019s possible and distinct between the two. But it\u2019s mostly just historical
    trivia now.\r\n\r\nOften the bolds were pulled in from other designs altogether.
    Sometimes they would be renamed and married together (what we Americans might
    call \u201Ca shotgun wedding\u201D ;-)\r\n\r\nOr compositors would just make their
    own combinations as the situation required. Often an Old Style was paired with
    an Antique or Ionic/Clarendon for emphasis, since these styles were naturally
    bold.\r\n\r\nThe combo in the posted example seems to be a little bit more closely
    related (but only a little).\r\n\r\nAs I said, our modern notion of \u201Cfamily\u201D
    was only just taking shape at the turn of the 20th century and was by no means
    pervasive."

    acquainted with all the historical trivia; somehow it feels important to have
    at least a ballpark understanding of these things. Thanks for starting me off!
