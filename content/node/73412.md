  body: "I was hoping this was something Oldnick (Nick Curtis) might have revived,
    but I can't find any slab serifs with an 'a', or and 'e' like this.  The Bitstream
    version of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/stymie/\">Stymie</a>
    has a flat-topped 't' and the right 'k', but the 'e' needs tweaking, and the 'a'
    you need looks more like Helvetica with serifs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I think this is a total mash-up. The e looks like it's Avant Garde, and I
    wouldn't doubt that the a is Helvetica with slab serifs grafted on...
