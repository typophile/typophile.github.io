  body: "Can't spot a perfect match but pretty convinced it's a font, a freebie and
    you could find it out by browsing these 2 sections at DaFont: [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Techno
    > Sci-fi]], [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304|Techno > Various]], [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501|Basic
    > Sans serif]]\r\n[[http://www.dafont.com/galant.font|Galant]] by Iconian is one
    of them. With very few modifications (mainly adding a second thin cut line), you
    could get pretty close."
