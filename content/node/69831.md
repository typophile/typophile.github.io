body: "Kern table (subtable) overflow situation:\r\nFinally having figured out which
  exact subtable is overflowing, and that removing pairs of lesser importance in that
  same subtable does indeed remedy the problem, and therefore being happy, but also
  getting a bit tired of staring at text files, I have to ask:\r\nIs there any tool
  that visualizes* subtables, highlights which ones have problems, and maybe even
  gives you an interface that lists the pairs in that subtable and lets you preview
  and (if you need to) remove them?\r\nIs anything like that maybe even planned for
  the next FontLab version? For instance, it might be useful if it was possible to
  group/filter the kern pair list (the thing on the right in the metrics/kerning window)
  by subtables, as in \xABshow only pairs in current subtable\xBB, or even \xABshow
  only pairs in problematic subtables\xBB.\r\n\r\n(* By \xABvisualize\xBB I don't
  necessarily mean pretty infographics, but any way really that would present the
  subtable information in a more digestible manner than the word \xABsubtable;\xBB
  hidden somewhere in a humongous text file; collapsible tables, interfaces, even
  a colored marker\u2026.)"

    have to highlight problematic issues yourself (except for what is covered by the
    <em>Consistency Checker</em>):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/development_tools/dtlotmaster.html\r\n\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

    here: http://letterror.blip.tv/file/1911431/  Kiel goes into various ways to deal
    with subtable overflow. \r\n\r\nWhat worked for my font was exporting it in Metrics
    Machine with the \"make subtables\" option checked. Then I didn't have to do trial
    and error deleting of kerns. "

  body: "William, thanks for the pointer. \r\nBen Kiel's talk was where I started.
    I found the \"you have to delete kerning and there's no way to know how much\"
    route frustrating; so I rolled back the kerning to the last compiling version,
    gradually added the missing kerning back in, and then when it overflowed I checked
    which portion of the kern feature the pair in question (which had just made it
    overflow) was in. Deleting a pair of lesser importance within the same section
    (between the previous and the next \"subtable;\" marker) allowed me to compile
    again. But this actually/possibly doesn't seem to work ad infinitum.\r\nSo I've
    pretty much solved the problem in my case (and I would be curious if this is in
    fact the way this works!), but it's good to know about the Metrics Machine option
    for the future. Cheers."
