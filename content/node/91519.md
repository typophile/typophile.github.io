    the description of the Benedictine Pro family at [[http://www.alterlittera.com/al_htm/oldtype/benedictine.htm|alterlittera.com]],
    including a link to this post. Please let me know if you think this is not appropriate.
    Thanks."

  body: "Not that you need my permission or anything, but: if all the characters in
    all the three weights of Benedictine Pro (including kerning) take up exactly the
    same width, then it is indeed what I'd call uniwidth. One thing that's not clear
    in your text though is how the Italics play into this: I assume they're not uniwidth
    with the Romans, but are they uniwidth among themselves?\r\n\r\nBTW, here's a
    nice new uniwidth design that really pushes the weight range envelope:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/axia/\r\n\r\nAnd
    here's an old related thread:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/61252\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Sabon was an early famous example of a typeface where normal and italics had
    the same width by design, so that the typeface would be identical both on Linotype
    machines (where this was required for technical reasons) and on other systems
    of typesetting.

  body: "Chris, if you mean \"different weight, same <em>width</em>\" then that's
    what I use \"uniwidth\" for. Some people call it \"duplexing\" (from way back
    actually) but there's a confusing Two in that term, plus no reference to width.\r\n\r\nBTW
    it doesn't have to be just weight: like in Sabon and Asap it could include Italics.
    Or even multiple styles, like in my Daam Entity from the 90s:\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/s_latin.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
