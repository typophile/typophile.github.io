  body: I hate this sort of answer, but sometimes the best you can do is figure out
    how you might re-create the sample. In this case, I can&#39;t see one font that
    has all these features, but Metro &#40;Linotype&#41; has the right B &amp; W,
    Futura has the right G, and BernhardGothic/PL Bernhardt &#40;Agfa&#41; has the
    right A &#40;in the Medium weight at least&#41;. &#40;Bernhard even has the right
    G&#41;. You could also tweak the bar of the Metro A, if you had to. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    an ugly solution, but I think it might work.

    <BR> <BR>Sorry. I said I hated this kind of answer, but sometimes you just need
    to re-create one thing, and it&#39;s &#42;possible&#42; that the original was
    created by cobbling parts together too.  <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, Yves, how do you make
    the links to the URL&#39;s like you just did with Bernhard Gothic and Metro? I&#39;m
    still sort of a newbie to this Forum thing&#41;'

    look the same, neither the weight. The Jaspert, Berry &amp; Johnson book &#40;post&#41;
    also gives other names for this font: Polar, Rund Grotesque &#40;not Round ?&#41;
    and Predilecta, maybe it is one of these that I couldn&#39;t find. Anyway, Kristall

  body: Thanks for all your effort, ladies and gentlemen. <BR>  <BR>I swear I&#39;m
    not happy to always come up with stuff that has no really easy solution... In
    fact, I need some advice according this &#34;BAWAG&#34; mystery as it is required
    to create some new lettering &#40;words completely different from &#34;BAWAG&#34;
    of course&#41; with a very familiar &#40;if not possible the same&#41; type as
    is used in the word &#34;BAWAG&#34;. <BR> <BR>What would YOU use?... ;-&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Thanks again and have a nice day. <BR> <BR>Peter Hajdin

  body: I think Ignacio&#39;s candidate from the Jaspert book may not be available
    in digital form, so my choice of one font that is closest overall would be Berthold&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=BQ90142003P1" target="_blank">
    Bernhard Gothic</a>. That would be the pricey option at $99 for 2 weights. <BR>
    <BR>URW also has the font in a variety of weights which you can buy individually.
    See <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bernhard-gothic/urw-t-heavy/charmap.html"
    target="_blank"> sample at MyFonts.com</a> for $19.95 each weight.
