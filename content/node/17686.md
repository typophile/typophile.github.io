  on the format OpenType and all it implies. I would appreciate if anyone could give
  me some opinions on the future of OpenType, if there will be a better format in
  the future or does this format complete all the necessary requisites. Please feel
  free to mention any website or Books that have any information on OpenType for it
  might be very useful for my work. \r\n\r\nThank You very much"

  body: Why do you "have to" do this? Is it just a very strong urge? I think most
    type designers would say that the notable omission from Opentype is support for
    multiple masters and non-linear scaling of features. But this has been discussed
    before (search), and the omission may be justifiable on the grounds that such
    features should be in type editors rather than in fonts.

  body: Maria, if you do a search on "opentype" you'll find more info than you probably
    need. To start with, i might suggest the [[typowiki|wiki]] article on [[opentype]],
    which will shoot you off to several different sources of information.
