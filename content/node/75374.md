  99% sure the \"Classic\" is some kind of Arial, right now I'm using Arial with the
  Bold adjustment by Photoshop and it appears to match.\r\n\r\nThe Old Spice on its
  own though I can't seem to find in my collection... I could totally use some help.
  It's for my birthday cake this weekend.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\nMatt."
