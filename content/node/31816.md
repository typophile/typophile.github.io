  body: This looks like it could be a font cache issue. Have you tried Font Finagler?

  body: "Odd. If I had to guess, I'd guess that it's some weird code-page issue.\r\n\r\nWhat
    platform and application is this happening on?\r\n\r\nHave you tried composing
    the text in another (text-only) app, copying and pasting it into the target app,
    and then applying the font formatting (Freight Micro)? If so, at what does the
    corruption occur?\r\n\r\nConversely, what happens when you copy the incorrectly-appearing
    text from your target app and paste it into a text-only app?"

    when you mix Mac and Windows encodings with Type 1 fonts.

  body: This happens to me occasionally when I already have Illustrator open and then
    I activate a font. I have to restart Illustrator and then it is gone.

    to figure out what's going wrong. Thanks for the suggestions! Incidentally...\r\n\r\n\u2022
    restarting AI doesn't fix it\r\n\u2022 I haven't tried Finagler\r\n\u2022 same
    issue shows up in TextEdit\r\n\u2022 copying error text to another app in another
    font displays correctly\r\n\u2022 correct text from another app pasted into AI
    then formatted as Freight Micro shows the same error\r\n\u2022 Omnes works like
    a charm"
