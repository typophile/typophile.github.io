body: "Hello - I'm trying to identify the owner/licensor of the font EEurostile Normal.
  My research stemming from the original font file has yielded the following: The
  original copyright owner/licensor was The FONT Company, which merged with Precision
  Type Foundry in 1993. Precision Type ceased operations in 2004 and is currently
  a defunct subsidiary of Protocall Technologies. I haven't rec'd any response from
  Protocall and I'm hoping someone out there can tell me who is the definitive licensor.
  I've narrowed it down to Protocall Technologies or Adobe, both of whom have not
  responded to my inquiries.\r\n\r\nPlease help!!! :)\r\n\r\nThanks. (EEurostile Normal

    So why not just re-licence? \r\n\r\nOr is the detective work that excites you?"

    owner would be a great help.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion. This one from Linotype
    is a little closer (extended version)\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=201792&productID=215594&productNo=L50607&siteID=TDWS\r\n"

  body: If you clicked on the package link available at the top of the page from Seb
    then you'd find the Extended version. Yes, the Eurostile trademark belongs to
    Linotype GmbH.
