  as a graphic designer for the Vrendenburg Music Center in Utrecht, for which he
  designed the typeface FF Scala especially for use in its own printed matter. In
  1991, FF Scala was released on [[FontShop]] International's [[FontFont]] label as
  its first serious text face. Later on Martin included the much-requested Bold Italic
  as well as the missing small cap weights. There are also two condensed weights,
  well-suited both as display faces and for narrow columns of text.\r\n\r\nMartin
  Majoor then enhanced his elegant serif with a companion sans-serif family. Again
  it is the simplicity that makes FF Scala Sans so captivating, while at the same
  time its distinct character is immediately recognizable. The family comprises six
  variants including an italic small caps style, a fairly rare beast in the typographic
  zoo. All weights come with both old style and lining numerals.\r\n\r\n<strong>External
