  and even though this is still a work in progress, I just wanted to see what some
  of you think of it so far .... The Feature will be about the restoring of Tokyo
  Station.\r\n\r\nP.S. the Tools spell out Tokyo Eki (Station) in Kanji .\r\n\r\n"

    of just stark white? Or will this be printed on a nice Japanese stock?\r\n\u2022
    Remove the shadows and put in one consistent shadow when you finish the photo-comp.\r\n\u2022
    I don\u2019t think that the dot around \u201CSaving Tokyo Station\u201D is the
    best way to separate the text from the image. If you really want to use it find
    a better way to play the two shapes against each other. "

    people looked real because the components were all the same scale."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback..\r\n\r\nI'm actually in the process of erasing all
    shadow's, and the initial idea was to incorporate a drop shadow of the real Kanji
    at the bottom or behind but we'll see how it works out ..\r\n\r\nAs for paper
    we usually use a 160 kg Matte Laminate, nothing to special but we have the option
    to use Spot UV or Foils when needed .\r\n\r\nI totally agree about the Dot and
    I think I'll remove it completely , or add the other feature titles inside it
    .\r\n\r\nSad thing is, I wish the time schedule was better for this project ,
    so I could have photographed all the tools together myself.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the support :)"

  body: "It might be more effective if you use silhouettes rather than photographs,
    something like those in <a href=\"http://www.gestalten.com/books/detail?id=402881820693dcee010693ddcc940565\">Neubau
    Welt</a>. That way you should be able to avoid having to emphasise the kanji.\r\n\r\nApart
    from the differing relative scales I don't think all of those tools would be of
    the sort used in the renovation of a station and the composition is a little too
    much biased towards the top.\r\n\r\nTim"
