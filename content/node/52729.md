  and if you had any major critiques. I designed this for a friend's girlfriend who
  is starting her own jewelry company. For all the non-french speakers out there,
  the name means \"the little gift\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/le_petit_cadeau_final_5008.jpg]"

  body: For what it's worth - I think the mark is not a good fit for a jewelry business,
    <em>especially</em> if it's a handmade jewelry. It's too geometrical, which implies
    precision, which in turn implies by-the-book execution and therefore a lack of
    creativity.

    But having said that I really like the bird illustration and overall composition.
    Have you tried to redraw this whole thing by hand? It might just spring to life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    it. But I have come back because I can't let it go, sorry.\r\nWhile I agree that
    the mark and the type do not work well for hand made jewelry I find the above
    statement to be, well, ridiculous.\r\nMy apologies for digressing, but it hit
    a nerve. "

    After all, there's all sorts of hand made jewellery out there from simple geometric,
    perhaps wooden ones to frilly complicated ones with precious stones. \r\n"

  body: Spacing needs attention; for example, I think there needs to be more vertical
    spacing between the lines.

  body: "I agree with Graham on the comment above - none of these things are necessarily
    implied by the logo. Hand-made jewellery is a very general term - I know a fair
    few people from university who make and sell jewellery in this way. This logo
    would suit some of them very well, and others not at all.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult
    to give anything more than vague feedback on the logo without knowing a bit more
    about the type of jewellery the client makes. One thing I would say is that I
    don't really feel that the type is a good match for the mark. It's a little bit
    po-faced compared to the cute, fun feel of the logo. I think a nice characterful
    sans is definitely the right choice, but I'm pretty sure this isn't the right
    one! I find the diagonal negative space caused by the left aligned text a little
    jarring as well, but that might just be me. Does it read oddly if 'le petit' is
    on the same line?\r\n\r\nAnyway, a good start and a likeable mark. Good stuff
    :)\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\n\r\nAndi\r\n\r\n[<a href='http://www.semibad.com'>semibad</a>]"

    the statement when taken out of its context of course sounds ridiculous. It wasn't
    meant to be a generic observation, merely an attempt to rationalize why this particular
    mark isn't working."

  body: I like the bird illustration - I think it fits the indie jewelry market, but
    the type doesn't work. Changing the typeface to something with a little more personality
    would go a long way to suggesting handmade.

  body: 'I think the logo of the bird is rather cute b/c the wings look like the ends
    of nicely cut ribbon.  I think this bird graphic looks different from all the
    other bird graphics I''ve seen from independent jewelry artists where they look
    like illustrations.  I agree with the majority of everyone here that maybe you
    should try another typeface with more character.  It''s nice to see a sans serif
    since a lot of indie artists use serif.  '

    think the 30's, 40`s style of your typeface does not fit well.\r\n\r\nI would
    try another style for keeping that flavour:\r\nHow about <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/house_industries/chalet_paris_1960/\">Chalet
    paris nineteen sixty</a>, lowercase, negative tracking \r\nor the same face/weight,
    all caps, with relatively tight setting.\r\n\r\nOr if you want full contrast between
    the icon and type:\r\nHow about a script?\r\n \r\n\r\n  "
