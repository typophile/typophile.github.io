  body: "It's called \"Marble Heart\", and it was an ATF typeface, based on an 1870s
    type called \"Gothic Double Shade\" from the Boston Type Foundry (which was an
    ATF predecessor). this info comes from Mac McGrew's great book on American Metal
    Typefaces. It is also shown in the Solotype Catalog & the Phil's Photo \"Homage
    to the Alphabet\" book, which means it made it into film type. There is a similar
    style called Orleans Open that was digitized by FontBank as \"OldWest\", but I
    do not think I know of a digital verson of Marble Heart. Maybe Mark Simonson or
    Mike F. would know.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Marble Heart was recently digitized for posterity. It is m-u-c-h older than
    McGrew thought: A specimen appears in the H\xE6nel catalog of 1847! \r\n\r\nAccording
    to Bauer, H\xE6nel imported roman types from GB and France. Since Nicolette Gray
    does not discuss it, it was probably French:\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.typeheritage.com/topic/marble-heart/\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/51266334@N08/sets/72157635201975897/\r\n\r\n--Anna"

  body: "Hi Anna, I don't understand what you mean when you say \" digitized for posterity.\"
    \ I followed your link and found reference to a new font called \"Margarethe\"
    \ but I can find no information on how this font is sold or given to the public.
    Nothing at Myfonts or Identifont.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Don,\r\n\r\nThe original mission of The Type Heritage Project [THP] was
    to publish a series of textbooks illustrating at least 1,500 already-existing
    digital revivals of display types originating c1800-WWI: \r\nhttp://typeheritage.com/textbooks/overview/\r\n\r\nIn
    the planning process, I realized the importance of preserving as many of these
    gems as possible--before maintainable letterpress equipment becomes any scarcer!
    The THP forum website recruits, coordinates and supports volunteer partners committed
    to THP's second mission:\r\nhttp://forums.typeheritage.com/undigitized/\r\n\r\nSo
    far, THP partners have produced hundreds of new revivals:\r\nhttp://forums.typeheritage.com/status/\r\n\r\n\"Margarethe\"
    is a revival of Marble Heart including a super-rare lower case perhaps not shown
    by ATF. It was renamed because \r\nI must [reluctantly!] advise revival developers
    to do so:\r\nhttp://forums.typeheritage.com/topic/legalities/\r\n\r\nLater this
    year, THP will launch an eCommerce font boutique specializing in revivals and
    others drawn from historical \r\nmaterials. A semi-functional model may be previewed
    here:\r\nhttp://www.vixemporium.com/fontcart/\r\n\r\nUntil then, these fonts are
    not available unless the partners decide to offer them elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnna"

  body: "Thanks Anna. Admirable project. But you might want to find a way of moving
    to actual sale of the fonts. Why not put them on Myfonts? People who are not part
    of your project also find the old typefaces interesting and will probably produce
    their own versions for sale in the near future, since they see nothing in the
    marketplace.\r\nDon"
