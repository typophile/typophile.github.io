body: "Hi, I'm wondering if anyone knows of an sans-serif (or possibly a handwritten
  font) that has a two-stroke capital Y instead of a three-stroke. It's for a yoga
  site logo, and I want it to be more energetic and urban than the typical ladies-in-leotards
  yoga font.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nErica"

    Sans</a>?\r\nOr rather like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=lithos&x=0&y=0&sample_text=Yoga&sample_size=74\">Lithos</a>?\r\n\r\n<a

    has a 2-stroke Y, too \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t feel very yogaesque to me.\r\nF"

  body: "I guess I could use a lowercase y, but in my sketches I'd had a larger, more
    gestural Y.\r\n\r\nThe Goudy Sans is more what I mean, that might be an option..."

  body: Goudy Sans has a few glyphs which can dramatically change the tone of the
    whole word... which can be a nice surprise, but you may need to review your usage.
