  body: "Yes, this is C\xE4sar Schrift. According to the PDF about Georg Schiller
    that Hans Reichardt has compiled for the Klingspor-Museum Offenbach and that can
    be  <a href=\"http://www.klingspor-museum.de/Kuenstler.html#S-Liste\">downloaded
    from here</a>, it was published in 1912 by Schriftgie\xDFerei C.F. R\xFChl, Leipzig.
    One year later, a bolder style was added.\r\n\r\nA reproduction of the C\xE4sar
    Schrift specimen can be found in <a href=\"http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/community/archive_type_2/index.3.htm?view=text_pics&year_from=&year_til=&location=&type_foundry=Schriftgie\xDFerei+C.F.+R\xFChl\">Type:
    A Visual History of Typefaces and Graphic Styles vol. 2 1901\u20131938</a>, edited
    by Cees W. de Jong, Alston W. Purvis and Jan Tholenaar (K\xF6ln: Taschen, 2010).\r\n\r\nI
    doubt a digital version has been published yet."

- body: "Thanks so much, Florian! I usually start choosing typefaces from digital
    fonts, not the other way around. I feel like I've Googled to the end of the internet
    and back. (My client is quite a challenge!)\r\n\r\nIs it possible to somehow confirm
    a digital version has not been published? If not, whom do I approach for permission
    to create one? Any guesses?\r\n\r\n(Florian, your portfolio is positively gorgeous!
    Wow.)"

  body: "<cite>Is it possible to somehow confirm a digital version has not been published?</cite>\r\n\r\nYou
    probably can\u2019t make a 100 percent sure. But it is pretty safe to say that
    there is no commercial digitization that explicitly credits C\xE4sar Schrift as
    a source.\r\n\r\n<cite>If not, whom do I approach for permission to create one?</cite>\r\n\r\nAs
    far as I know, you don\u2019t need to ask for someone\u2019s permission, in order
    to create a digital font when starting with printed samples of a 1913 metal typeface.
    Also, I doubt that the name is trademarked or otherwise protected. But \u2026
    I am not a lawyer.\r\n\r\n(Thank you for the kind words, much appreciated.)"

    more than 70 years ago), you\u2019re in the clear according to European copyright
    law too."
