  body: I&#39;ve seen them occasionally -- sorry can&#39;t remember the names of any
    typefaces off-hand -- but they are uncommon and, typically, of little use. The
    problem is that in an fi ligature it is typical for the overhang of the f to replace
    the dot of the i. The only way to have sufficient space for an accent above the
    i is to either move the i further from the f or to retract the overhang of the
    f; in either case, you usually cease to have a need for a ligature.

    <BR> <BR>John: Or you could fuse the &#34;f&#34; terminal and the acute, just
    like is usually done with an &#34;fi&#34; ligature. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I&#39;ve thought about such a ligature but never seen one. <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/">Storm</a>
    sells at least <a href="http://www.pismolijna.cz/pdf/Walbaum.pdf">one package</a>
    with f-ligatures for f next to an umlauted &#40;dieresis&#41; vowel. <a href="http://www.romana-hamburg.de/fraktur7.htm">Helzel&#39;s
    version of Wilhelm Klingspor-Schrift</a> includes some long-s ligatures with the
    dieresis compressed and shifted over somewhat. They may have been part of Koch&#39;s
    original design. <BR> <BR>Andrea de Leeuw van Weenen <a href="http://www.ntg.nl/texnl92may.html#Mon%2C%2025%20May%2092%2013:47:00%20CET">wrote</a>
    about an acute fi ligature to the TeX-NL list back in 1992, it  would appear.
    That&#39;s all I can find about it. <a href="http://www.google.com.ni/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22accented%2Bligatures%22">Mrs
    Eaves Opentype</a> contains accented quaint ligatures, including a capital acute
    fi.
