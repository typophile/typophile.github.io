body: "I work at a publication here in Chicago heading up the marketing design department.
  about 6 or 7 months a young woman named nancy was hired here as group art director.
  the other day i was having one of our many conversations regarding type when she
  began referring to her time at Thirst working with some great people (some of whom
  i've had the accidental pleasure of meeting). \r\n\r\none thing she mentioned was
  a program that worked with type in a way that you could design something like 7
  letters...i'll call them key letters...and based on those key letters, the program
  will update on the fly all the other characters that use characteristics of those
  key letters. she couldnt remember the name of the program but she remembered Chester
  using it on various occassions. \r\n\r\ni'm not a fontlab expert and have only tinkered
  with the program a little, but i dont recall ever seeing a function within the program
  that would do that. i have heard of a program that was not for public sale but was
  in the works a few years back, dedicated to decreasing the time factor involved
  in making fonts and streamlining the whole process...(wish i could find the reference..perhaps
  in the book Designing Typefaces?). so if anyone out there knows what this program
  Chester was using might be, i'd love to know. or if Chester, you happen to read
  this, a little insight on what programs youve used to create typefaces would be
  much appreciated. -thanks"

  body: I would guess it was <a href="http://just.letterror.com/ltrwiki/RoboFog">RoboFog</a>,
    though I've never used it and really have no idea how it works. Seems the LettError
    boys have put together a new version for Fontlab called <a href="http://just.letterror.com/ltrwiki/RoboFab">RoboFab</a>.

  body: "Earlier versions of FontLab (2.5 and 3.0 I think) had UI support for PS subroutines,
    which meant you could define a section of a glyph as a subroutine and then apply
    it an other glyphs. If you edited the original subroutine source, the changes
    would be applied to other glyphs that referenced the same subroutine.\r\n\r\nSubroutines
    are a PS-specific function, so I think they were most likely dropped from the
    FontLab UI when the program began dealing with TrueType in a serious way.\r\n\r\nNow
    'subroutinisation' is something that happens on the fly when a CFF font is generated,
    i.e. it is applied after the design work as a font size efficiency measure, rather
    than as a design tool."

  body: "Also, the Chameleon font editor worked pretty much exactly that way.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I'd love to have support for something that worked akin to the PS subroutines
    the way it was in FL 2.5. It was very cool. They wouldn't have to support it at
    the level of the exported font, just as a design tool.\r\n\r\nT"

    to what i was hearing although i think through my middle man, there was a misunderstanding.
    none the less, an interesting goose chase...\r\n\r\nw|m"
