  that I received from my client.  She can't remember the font and can't contact the
  original designer.  Much appreciated if you can help!

  body: "I challenge the claim that this is Knockout. The centre bar of its \u2018E\u2019
    is noticeably shorter than the letter as a whole in all of the weights. This is
    not the case in <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/linotype_univers_com_510_compressed_medium/?&sample_text=EXODUS&sample_size=144&acs_pt=32&update=0\">Univers
    Compressed Medium</a>, which seems like a perfect match to me. And you can get
    just this style for less than $500."
