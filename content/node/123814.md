  through Volume 19, #1 (Spring 1992). I can''t bring myself to throw them out. Do
  they have any value? Is anyone interested in them?'

    to pay you for them I would love to have them! I could pay for postage...

  body: They do have value. You could offer them on Ebay, or contact the Rob Saunders
    at the Letterform Archive in San Francisco. He probably has a full set already
    but might know of someone looking for them.
