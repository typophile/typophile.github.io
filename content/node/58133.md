body: "Well I have been frequenting this site for quite some time now, and I figured
  that it was about time for me to attempt my own font. So here goes nothing... this
  is really my first attempt ever at designing a typeface and I'm sure that these
  characters are riddled with beginners' mistakes. I would appreciate any comments
  you can give: complements, criticism, and/or anything in between.\r\n\r\nTentatively
  the name is \"Abodwo\", a word meaning 'peace' in Twi [assuming that my friend didn't
  lie to me]. It is still in the rudimentary stages of design and I have only posted
  the glyphs that I am somewhat-okay with.<!--break-->\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abodwo_6718.jpg]\r\n\r\nCurrently
  I am especially unhappy with the <strong>e</strong> and the <strong>f</strong>,
  but if you see any others that just scream \"FIX ME NOWWW!\", let me know. I'll
  be working on this whenever I have a spare moment between my final examinations,
  so hopefully it won't take too long for me to make corrections... but no promises!"

  body: "Good to see this. \r\nI'm a beginner too as I think you know, so take with
    a grain of salt.\r\n\r\n'r''s ...arm? ear? whatever you call that nonvertical
    part seems too light to me.\r\n'k''s arm and leg both seem too light, too tapered,
    and the leg too casually curved\r\n'j' tail's taper seems similarly out of place.\r\n'd'
    looks narrow next to 'b'\r\n'o' looks a bit diamond-shaped to me; is that intentional?\r\n\r\nI
    like the character of this a lot. \r\nSome of the bowls have a very appealing
    shape, and I especially like the ascenders - I think they can be a distinctive
    feature of the face without being distracting or unintegrated. \r\n\r\nKeep it
    up!"

  body: "This has promise!\r\n\r\nIn addition to what Craig pointed out...\r\n\r\nThe
    bowl of the 'b' looks too wide towards the bottom.\r\nThe stroke weights need
    adjusting. The straight stems are maybe a touch too thin compared to the curved
    strokes of the bowls of 'a', 'd', etc. The 'g' looks too heavy. 'o' looks a bit
    light compared to the bowls. The middle stroke of 'e' could stand thinning.\r\nConventionally,
    between the inner diagonals of 'w', the right stroke should be heavier than the
    left.\r\n\r\nYou might want to think about an overall plan of distributing weight
    on your strokes; letters like 's' suggest emphasizing the horizontals near the
    baseline and the x-height. Take a look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_balance_1/\">FF
    Balance</a> to see what I mean.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work!"

  body: "Well, I had a few hours to work on this font today so here is an image of
    the updated glyphs:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abodwo-0_5034.2.png]\r\n\r\nNow
    looking at this, the 'd' may still look a little too skinny.\r\n\r\neliason:  Thanks
    for your suggestions! I hope that I fixed the 'j', 'k', and 'r'. The diamond-shaped
    'o' was definitely unintentional, and I tried to make it rounder. Both you and
    Jongseong mentioned this letter, so hopefully it's better now.\r\n\r\nJongseong:
    \ I'm not exactly sure what you meant by \"distributing weight\", but I tried
    to normalize the stroke weights in all of the characters. Tell me if I understood
    you wrong or if I still haven't corrected the problem."

  body: "This is coming along nicely.\r\nI do think d is still too narrow.\r\nAre
    the counters of m equal in width? They look unbalanced but that may be the rasterizing
    of the graphic file.\r\nMaybe extend k's arm higher and further (I think it can
    have some \"overshoot\"). To me this k still may be a bit of a misfit but it's
    better suited than the previous version.\r\nYou may want to thin the \"crossbar\"
    part of e a bit."

  body: "Much improved! I still think 'b' looks too wide next to the 'd', so you should
    try equalizing the apparent size of the two. With the new 'o', the 'd' is the
    one that looks rather narrow.\r\n\r\nBy the weight distribution, I mean an overall
    plan for which strokes would be thicker than which strokes. In the final paragraph
    of <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/ff%20-%20legato_about.pdf\">this PDF about
    FF Legato</a>, different stroke weight distribution models for Univers, FF Balance,
    and FF Legato are compared, with an accompanying picture.\r\n"

  body: "Sorry for the long delay, but it has been quite a busy week. I have put in
    some time into making the suggested changes, and I finished the set of lowercase
    glyphs. Tell me what you think.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abodwo-0_4332.3.png]\r\n\r\nAs
    for the 'k', I made some alternatives. I'm not too comfortable with the third
    version, but maybe I'll warm up to it with time...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abodwo-0_5952.3-k.png]\r\n\r\nHopefully
    by my next post I will have some capital letters designed but I'm not promising
    anything. I still have quite a few finals left and school doesn't end till the
    12th."

  body: "I like the last \"k\". It fits in style and makes the face stand out from
    the rest a bit. The inner curve of \"g\"\xB4s terminal needs a bit of fixing."
