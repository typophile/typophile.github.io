    Neutraface feel to it.

    body: I can fudge it with Kabell, Triplex, Avenir or Toronto Subway, but my hope
      is that someone will say, "Oh sure, that's BlahBlah engraver's modern, they
      used it on WPA public buildings all the time!"

  body: If those letters are part of the building, it is almost certainly not a font
    but a product of the sign-making trade as it existed then. It was a parallel but
    separate industry to type founding, just as handlettering was. There was certainly
    some cross-polinization going on, but it was not like nowadays when you can go
    down to FastSigns and have them make a sign with any old font.

  body: "\"not a font but a product of the sign-making trade as it existed then\"\r\n\r\nIt
    is hard for today's younger designers to realize what a different world it was
    back then. Most things were done by hand.  As Mark says, there was a \"Sign Making\"
    trade which was not the same as the \"Hand Lettering Artist\" or the \"Typesetting
    trade\". It was quicker and cheaper to get someone from the proper trade to just
    do it by hand from scratch than to try and port one set of letters from craft
    A to either B or C.\r\nOur world of the quick scan-font ID-online purchase-Postscript
    output-CadCam is quite incredible when compared to how things were done pre tech.
    People actually wrote hand written letters to eachother then too.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    see hand-painted signs where they were trying to match Helvetica. I guess the

    technology and aesthetics.\r\n\r\nAs a jump point for the sign industry, I frequently
    start at <a href=\"http://www.sign101.com/\" target=\"new\">SignIndustry.com</a>.\r\n\r\nThere
    are also sites dedicated to the bronze and stonecut monument trade, vinyl sign
    cutting, restoration signage, and architectural-environmental signage.\r\n\r\nA
    funny thing though... I feel a typographer is qualified to design architectural
    signage, but I wouldn't trust an architect to design a book. :-)"

    you mean \"ignorant.\"\r\n\r\nI figured it was probably a one-off, but I was hoping
    that someone who perhaps had some familiarity with historical sign-making or engraving
    might be able to tell me \"Oh, yeah, it's based on this or that.\"  \r\n\r\nWhile
    we're on the subject, was there a suite of off-the-rack letterforms that signmakers/engravers
    would use as templates or stencils back then? Did foundries make any such thing?\r\nFor
    example, if I walked into a monument shop would the salesperson have me look through
    a sample book of some kind, and was there a national supplier of sample books?\r\n\r\n"

    many of these systems use PC front ends allowing the user to load at least TrueType
    fonts. Other system are proprietary but do offer font kits.\r\n\r\nOne of the
    largest manufacturers of sign making equipment is Gerber Scientific. You can see
    their <a href=\"http://www.gspinc.com/products/fonts/index.html\" target=\"new\">font
    offering here</a>.\r\n\r\nDuring the mid-to-late eighties, I worked with Agfa
    in private labelling two of the Gerber Scientific vinyl plotters, which means
    I did type specimen books for specific sign making equipment and sample signs
    for boats, vans, storefronts, etc."

    on how to make the letters. There were general principles, but each author tended
    to have his own style. There were often references to popular type styles, maybe
    showing how to do lettering that resembled \"Caslon\" or \"Futura\" or whatever.
    There were also trade schools and apprenticeships, so the knowledge and techniques
    were passed on from generation to generation."
