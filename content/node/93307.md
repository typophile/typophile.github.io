  body: "Hi Marcel, I am a great fan of your work. I even made it the subject of my
    art history thesis in Art School in 1980. The same year I visited your retrospective
    show in the newly opened Centre Pompidou in Paris.\r\n\r\nBTW I thought you left
    for another sphere in 1968, but, hey, I won\u2019t mention that to anyone!\r\n\r\nAbout
    your sample: I don\u2019t recognize it, and it can\u2019t be to your taste, I
    feel\u2026 "
