body: Hi <BR>This is a real annoying one, I shall apologise in advance; Im after the
  font, or something similiar, thats generally used in 50&#39;s &#40;I think&#41;
  American postcards which read &#39;welcome to...&#39; then the name of the state
  or city, which in turn, has images within the typeface. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately I
  cannot find an example anywhere, can anyone put me out of my misery by assisting
  with both example and ID? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>R

  body: The &#34;welcome to&#34; part was often as not Brush Script. The city name
    with the pictures in it was always done by hand.
