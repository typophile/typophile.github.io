body: I edit a charity magazine and have to send pdf&#39;s of the layout to various
  managers for approval. <BR> <BR>The layout is done in Quark 6.1. The main font is
  Gill Sans.  <BR> <BR>When I export the layout as a pdf all of my punctuation marks
  go missing! , &#39; &#34; etc all disappear. <BR> <BR>This makes proof reading a
  nightmare and doesn&#39;t make them look kindly on poor little ol&#39; me! Any other
  font is fine. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions on how to fix?

  body: 'I&#39;ve run into this problem on our Macs w/ QX 4.1 when printing. It happens
    with only one face: Times New Roman. We have the good fortune of being able to
    use Times instead, so I can&#39;t offer a fix. <BR> <BR>My guess is that your
    font is bad/ corrupt and needs to be replaced. I&#39;m sure others have a more
    specific diagnosis for you. Does this happen with Gill in other apps?'

  body: This is almost certainly not a corrupt font. It is likely an encoding problem
    caused by having two different versions of the same font in the workflow in ways
    that conflict. <BR> <BR>First, make sure you&#39;re embedding the font. Always
    embed all fonts. <BR> <BR>Second, check your system really thoroughly for multiple
    versions of Gill Sans. Is there an OS X system dfont for Gill Sans as well as
    a Type 1 version, both on your system? If so, uninstall one of them. <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thanks to both Thomas and Chris. <BR> <BR>I tried to deactivate mulitple copies
    of GillSans but it caused Font Book to crash. I&#39;ve just been up to our printers
    and when I substitute their font the problem is solved! Bizarre one but I&#39;ve
    a working solution so the jobs done in the end. <BR> <BR>Cheers <BR> <BR>Michael
