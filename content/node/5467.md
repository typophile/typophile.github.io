  body: I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a font, Anja, and if it is, it&#39;s not  <BR>very
    good at all. It looks like someone took their ruler  <BR>and designed the characters
    on a grid. You can tell  <BR>by the way the &#34;k&#34; and &#34;a&#34; are completely
    out of balance,  <BR>and there&#39;s no optical correction whatsoever &#40;check  <BR>the
    spot where the curve of the &#34;r&#34; joins the stem&#41;.

    besides Eurostile are <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=HG23FONT-FO&amp;sub=inuse"
