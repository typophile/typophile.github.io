  and yet there were some Modern faces that I liked in addition to Century Expanded
  and Century Schoolbook on the one hand, and Bodoni on the other.\r\n\r\nJust recently,
  I found one book online that was an excellent example of what I thought of as a
  \"good\" Scotch Roman. It was entitled \"Gravitation\", and dated from 1835, and
  was written by George Biddell Airy, of fame in connection with the discovery of
  Neptune. While the book did not note its typeface, it did note its printer, and
  so I searched for other books by that printer, one William Clowes.\r\n\r\nIt turns
  out that this was a famous printing firm, being one of the early stereotype printers,
  and they made their own type. In addition to printing the Penny Cyclopaedia and
  the Penny Magazine, they also printed an edition of Lyell's Principles of Geology
  and Franklin's account of his expedition to the Arctic.\r\n\r\nThe italic, however,
  still looks odd and dated to modern eyes, but the roman seems to me to be a very
  friendly and human example of the Modern Roman.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clowes_6426.jpg]"

    there is no flourish at the beginning of the \"v\", as one finds in Miller and
    Austin."

  body: "I'm not saying that this face is necessarily as appealing to others as the
    one noted in another recent post, the \"Transitional English Type\" from Updike.\r\n\r\nIn
    the late 19th and early 20th centuries, I had seen so many bad examples of Scotch
    Roman as to cause me to deprecate the entire genre. Finding one where the letters
    appear very well-proportioned is pleasing to me. But is it different enough from,
    say, Bell or Oxford to be generally useful?\r\n\r\nAfter Times Roman, the next
    two most popular serif typefaces are Caledonia and Century Expanded, so there
    does seem to be a preference for the plainness of a Modern face if it is attractive
    enough - although Baskerville and Garamond, for example, are also still quite
    popular. And then there's Palatino and Weiss Roman."
