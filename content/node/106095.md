  a tank wagon in two eras.\r\nThe first might be \"not a font but a hand drawn-logo/script\".
  Or are there fonts like that?\r\n\r\nThe second I guess is Antique Olive Black with
  a modified G and ... Brush Script with modified s.\r\nDoes anybody have a better
  guess?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gandagas1_5992.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gandagas2_6131.jpg]"

  body: "For the top version it may be lettering and I have not looked for a specific
    font to match, but there is an interesting discussion of squared S fonts at http://typophile.com/node/106047\r\nClipping
    the terminals of S and G [plus C and a couple of other letters] would work.  to
    give you a font that produces this result.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: Thanks. Meanwhile I managed to cobble something together in Fontstruct for
    the first GANDAGAS (only needs five easy letters), and for the script I did my
    best to clean up and vectorize the photo (not having a straight photo for this
    version makes it a bit difficult to distort and squeeze the writing to look more
    or less right). It will have to do. (I'm in the model railway business.)
