  body: It's very close to the original <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bitstream/bookman_ot/">Bookman</a>
    (not the half-arsed limp ITC digitization).

  body: "Yes, I was going to say that too, but the 'a' in Bookman has a shorter tail
    and the 4 has a baseline serif. If there was such a thing as Cushing Wide, it
    might be close.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks very much for these suggestions, -\r\nNeither seems to quite hit the
    mark.\r\nCushing is close in spirit, but not quite there.\r\nThe letterforms are
    very odd, clumsy in places, irregular, and it gives the font a a lot of character
    feel when set at smaller sizes.\r\nI add a couple of enlarged samples which might
    help to identification?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arena_enlarged1_4280.gif]"

  body: "Turns out that Bookman (or Bookman Old Face) wasn't too far off. However,
    they are all too 'contemporary' in their interpretations, compared to the sample
    posted. When looking for old references, I found this old sample to be very close,
    something called STRATFORD OLD STYLE by Hansen Type Foundry:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hansen-stratford-oldstyle_6641.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    I found another called ANTIQUE OLD STYLE, credited to the Stevens Shanks foundry
    in ca. 1860, this time with matching italics:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/antique-old-style_4044.gif]\r\n\r\nThere
    is yet another, Antique No. 310, by the Bruce Type Foundry, which later also released
    a related face called Bartlett Oldstyle. When Bruce was taken over by ATF, they
    later released Bartlett Oldstyle as Bookman, which may have served as the blueprint
    for what is Bookman today.\r\n\r\nHowever, the samples I found are still not exact
    matches (e.g. serif on the numeral 4), but the distinctive lower case 'a' is there,
    which I have not found in any other typeface.\r\n\r\nWondering if anyone knows
    of any digital interpretations of fonts called STRATFORD OLD STYLE, ANTIQUE OLD
    STYLE, ANTIQUE NO. 310, or BARTLETT OLDSTYLE?\r\n\r\nAny pointers?\r\n"

  body: "Apparently someone has done a digitization of Stratford Old Style (or one
    of those typefaces mentioned above), but changed the name and didn't credit the
    original design, so searches for the names give nothing other than Luc Devrouye's
    web site of type lore.\r\n\r\nThe fact that none of our other participants seems
    ever to have seen this in digital use, suggests it is not being used much and
    is not (probably) available commercially.\r\n\r\nThe best course would probably
    have been to contact the magazine about it. Now, three years later, those who
    worked with it may be long gone, if the magazine is still published, which apparently
    it is.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
