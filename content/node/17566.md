body: 'well it''s been "an elaborate hoax" for years, but it seems <a href="http://www.orangeitalic.com/luxury/">Luxury</a>
  by [[Orange Italic]] is soon to be offered for sale from [[House Industries|House]].
  I came upon this tidbit of information when i was flipping through the <a href="http://houseind.com/showandtell/index.php?id=129">Artist
  Proof limited edition catalog</a> that i serendipitously received in my mailbox
  today. I''m interested in seeing how literally they keep with the story: will the
  set cost $1500? will the cd-rom be signed  and numbered by the Vocabularistic Giant
  and the Unauthorized Biographer? will it be packaged in a hand-painted, velvet-lined
  box? i guess for the rest of the details i''ll just have to wait and see...'

  body: You didn't told me so. didn't you see this first post was in January? Although
    this set has been in the "Coming Soon" section on their website, i'm sure these
    weren't available previous to today as the announcement hasn't even come out yet,
    except for on their web page with a blog entry being posted 5 hours ago. :^p

  body: "Itoldyouso was about the price. Somebody (you?) was a bit reluctant to believe
    that it would cost less than $300. It was buyable in the fonts section last week.
    Okay, I didn\u2019t buy it yet but you know what I mean. Or perhaps I\u2019m going
    crazy."
