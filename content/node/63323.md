  body: Yeah, that is a large number, and I've also noticed quite a lot of new users
    (not guests) in the last 6 months. It'd be interesting to find out where the new
    people are getting referred from.

  body: "I'm pretty sure that web bots are no longer counted as visitors. They were
    at one time and it really threw our numbers off, but it was fixed a year or so
    ago.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at the data in a while, but I can tell you that things
    like Twitter are driving traffic here \u2013 retweets especially because they
    get blogged and forwarded, etc\u2026"

  body: "Thanks Zara. I was wondering if social media were responsible, from looking
    at the Flickr and LinkedIn Typophile groups. \r\n\r\nIt's an interesting time
    in web history \u2014 interesting for web developers who have new ways to connect
    with clients/customers."

    high :-)\r\n\r\nthanks zara, i was thinking that twitter and facebook would be
    helping.\r\n\r\ndo we know if many of the visitors are signing up? are we seeing
    any transfer?"

  body: "The way they used to count a few years ago, visitors were in the thousands,
    far more than today.  I am sure it is all a matter of who gets counted and how.
    \ I get the general feeling that the number of posts are way down from what they
    were 3 or 4 years ago.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
