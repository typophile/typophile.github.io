    to the Aachen and Bembo clones.)\r\n\r\nDick, thank you for removing the reference
    to the plagiarized font; no need to pretend nothing was going wrong. And I've
    edited my post accordingly.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean about \"tracking
    a designer's life work\". When I saw the font you linked to, I immediately had
    to suspect plagiarism. I did a few minutes of research, and my suspicion was reinforced
    enough to issue the warning. And I've been like this for 44 years, not 13.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Dafont being an \"authentic source\", I really have no idea how somebody could
    think that... And there's no way I'm wasting time trying to convert bottom-feeders.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the people who made the sign are probably not the people who made the web graphics,
    so it's actually common to end up with different (if similar) fonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
