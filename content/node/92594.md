  typeface out. Any clues?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Saunalahti_1_3852.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  closest I can come is Skoda Pro. Reference image below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SKODA-Pro_4181.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for looking"

  body: I think this is a customised wordmark based on <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/neo_sans_pro/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=74&sample_text=Saunalahti.fi&ft=liga&acs_pt=32">Neo

  body: "@R. I thought so too. I had earlier checked Neo Sans. Letters like 'a', 'u'
    and 't' don't line up. Unless its a custom cut. \r\n\r\nNeoSans also has a cousin
    named Neotech. Some elements could be from there - http://link.io/1z\r\n\r\nMaybe
    someone else has a closer match."

  body: "That\u2019s what I meant by \u2018custom\u2019: They took letters from Neo
    Sans and Neo Tech, left some (almost) unchanged (such as \u2018h\u2019 or the
    \u2018fi\u2019 ligature) and modified others (such as \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018u\u2019).
    Of these latter, some parts (the \u2018a\u2019 bowl, for example) still overlap
    perfectly with the glyphs from Neo Sans."

  body: "No, I don\u2019t think so. As far as I can see, letters based on Neo Sans/Tech
    appear only in the logo Argjun posted. As riccard0 pointed out, Soho Gothic is
    used on their website and in other documents."

  body: 'The logo is a special blend of Neo Sans and Soho Gothic (both by Sebastian
    Lester). This is because we wanted a clean wordmark. I hope we did his work justice
    in creating the mix. As suggested before by riccard0 we used Soho Gothic as Saunalahti''s
    typeface elsawhere. '
