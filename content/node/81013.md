body: "I am currently\u2014and rather slowly\u2014in the process of updating the entire
  Nick\u2019s Fonts library of fonts in anticipation of packaging them in thematic
  collections and one whole-shebang package. The entire collection represents twelve
  years of work, with 530+ font families and over 600 fonts. In order to make the
  packages more navigable for end users, I would very much like to produce accompanying
  documents classifying the fonts according to style, weight, historical period, attitude
  and the like. Unfortunately, the exigencies of production (as it were) leave me
  with little time (or energy) to do the necessary heavy lifting.\r\n\r\nSo\u2026it
  occurred to me that there might be, somewhere in Typophile land, an instructor of
  typography at the collegiate level who might be able to assist me in this endeavor.
  This is what I propose:\r\n\r\n<ul><li> I will provide you and your students with
  my entire collection of fonts, fully licensed for use in the classroom.</li>\r\n<li>I
  will donate to your program type specimen books from my collection, to include the
  ATF 1923 book, the 1934 ATF book, Barnhart Brothers &amp; Spindler\u2019s Catalog
  #25, and a number of vintage lettering chapbooks.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nWhat I would
  like in return, at a minimum, would be spreadsheets covering the classification
  I outlined, plus any other classifications which we mutually agree might be relevant.
  And I am certainly willing to consider other options which might allow your students
  to flex their creative muscles in ways that would also add value to my retail packages.\r\n\r\nIf
  you are such an instructor and interested, please drop me a line a himself [at]
  nicksfonts [dot] com, and we can talk turkey\u2026or grease\u2026"

    a stupid assignment?</li>\r\n<li>It's way too much work for over $5,000 full retail

    ... just to get my sweaty hands on all of those fonts!\r\n\r\nSeriously, I thought
    this one of the sweeter deals, lately. An echo on behalf of Nick: No one?"

    I hope they are interested. It seems like an interesting project for those just
    learning how to classify type.

    because professors are notoriously over-worked, and what you're asking for is
    a lot of energy!  \r\n\r\nHowever, it seems like a great project, good luck!"

  body: I teach and I'm very interested in type classification so this caught my eye,
    but it might be a few semesters before I would get to teach a class for which
    this would be a match. Intriguing project idea, though!

  body: "Hi Nick\r\n\r\nVery interested. Your post coincided with me having to take
    my eyes off the ball and attend to other matters at end of term here in the UK.
    This would make a great major project for a final year undergraduate student,
    and not just as a 'one-off'. Expect to receive email from me and a couple of friends
    on this \u2013 if only to ask if we're not too late!  "

  body: "Thanks to all who have replied. Let me add a little more information about
    what I <em>think</em> I\u2019m looking for.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to create some kind
    of tool which will make navigating my font collection easier, in terms of locating
    the kind of font one is looking for, and being more user-friendly than a simple
    PDF catalog. However, I don\u2019t have any preconceived notions as to what such
    a tool might look like. Thus, part of the project <em>could</em> include asking
    students to devise a classification system which is meaningful to them as potential
    font users/buyers. If they could come up with a widget or an interface to make
    navigation easier, so much the better, but it\u2019s not a required element.\r\n\r\nSo,
    the font navigation database is what I would like as a minimum: any suggestions
    to expand the scope of the project\u2014specimen sheet design, perhaps?\u2014would
    be eagerly entertained, as would be options for offering students incentives/rewards
    for work beyond the main scope of the project.\r\n\r\nI am not under any formal
    time constraints or deadlines: I still have some fine-tuning to do myself. But,
    obviously, the sooner the project gets done, the sooner it can be an important
    value-added component to the font collection as a stand-alone  retail package.
    I hope this info makes things a little clearer\u2026\r\n\r\n"

    type nuts I know down here. So someone is bound to be interested. Sounds like
    a great project.
