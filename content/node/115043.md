  Two pics from my font meant to work in small sizes and in negative use white on
  black ground. To create a version that is similar in weight to the original one
  has to do a very much lighter character design like the one above in this pic.\r\nBut
  it\u2019s worth while because sub-pixel fonts look so much neater and better!\r\nTo
  see it \u201Eat work\u201C here is my credit page part of my homepage: [[http://www.stefanseifert.com/Contact.html]]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sub-pixel_version_5553.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sf41_sub-pixel_4217.png]"

    or accurately control them without a ton of fonts, the effort is rarely worth
    it. But the lesson is important, and sometimes a little effort can go a long way. "

  body: "Yes, in fact there is JS necessary to control it.\r\nFirst of all the site
    has to check if user is on Mac at all, otherwise the font will appear very very
    thin and broken. Second on animated scenes text blocks will need no transparency
    in its background otherwise they also will not show correctly while animated (f.e.
    transparency transition).\r\nSo it seems you are right but on the other hand I
    love the idea of getting fonts more and more readable on screen devices. And the
    sub-pixel rendering in my eyes is big progress.\r\nDid you make some experiences
    with your work? I would love to discuss it and see your results.\r\n\r\nPS \r\nI
    recently observed that, yet, the results of sub-pixel fonts are far more consistent
    for what regards cross browser. Interesting to me. Because grayscale anti-aliasing
    show great differences on some browsers. Google Chrome is best here, Safari worse
    ecc. Meanwhile the sp fonts look nearly the same everywhere."
