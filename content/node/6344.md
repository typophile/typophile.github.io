  body: hmm... <BR> <BR>I actually thought it was bastard. I got the sample character
    from an old flyer I did that had been converted to outlines &#40;hence no font
    names&#41;. I knew it was a Barnbrook font and quickly determined it to be Bastard
    prior to posting it here. <BR> <BR>After seeing your side comparison of the two
    I went back to an older version of the source and discovered that I actually had
    used a knock off version of bastard named Barnbrook Gothic. A typographic faux
    pas indeed. At the time I created the flyer I had no clue the font I used was
    not an original design. <BR> <BR>The floor is yours Grant. Apologies to Mr. Barnbrook.
    Had I known better I would not have supported an intellectual property theif.

    version of Bastard published by Jonathan himself. I don&#39;t want to lend any
    credence to a knockoff, but Jonathan has been known to heavily modify faces between
    concept and publication. <BR> <BR>Anywho, that&#39;s another topic for discussion..

    but I really like the occasional clunky face,  <BR>a heritage from my being exposed
    to grunge deconstruction at  <BR>an impressionable age. <BR> <BR>Case in point,
    this is the Troubleman house face, commonly used  <BR>on our gig posters and CD

  body: I'm guessing Garamond Premier Pro? It comes with 34 fonts... so there's a
    good chance it has something with endings? Although I haven't been able to get
    hold of the char set pdf.

  body: "Nope. Both of them are fairly recent fonts. I think the ligature one was
    released in October last year. It also came from the guy who gave us Helvetica
    Flair.\r\n\r\nAnd the first one is a custom font that is now for sale, it is also
    a Dutch font."
