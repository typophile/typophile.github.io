  a lot less lurkers on the site. It used to be that there were thousands online,
  but I always felt that that was a bit extreme.\r\n\r\nNow the numbers say this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ishot-1_4239.jpg]\r\n\r\nWas
  the system less accurate before, or has the actual attendance of typophile gone
  down the crapper?"

    a crazy amount of traffic for a forum to sustain. Methinks that number wasn't

    if you go to the link I posted above, you'll find Christian's explanation -- an
    interesting look at the tech stuff that goes on behind-the-scenes on a website."

    registered. The reason can be that the browser is set not to accept cookies. So
    you''re counted as guest or "lurker" as long as you''re reading, and as registered
