body: "I love the minimal sans look that you get on a lot of sites as text. I was
  thinking it may be arial, but without any antialiasing on it. Whatever the case,
  I wanna recreate it in Adobe... Arial in adobe is anti-aliased and clean as can
  be.. not the look I need. \r\n\r\nAm I correct on the ID of types like this? Let
  me who you what I mean. \r\n\r\nEven the \"loading data\" text uses it. The type
  in this site. What am I not finding?\r\n\r\nhttp://kashiwasato.com/?"

  body: Rather nice usage of flash indeed, but I despise the use of sound on websites.
    It annoys the hell out of me.
