body: "Dear Typophiles, \r\n\r\nI'm quite new here and I need advice in selecting
  my font. Currently I'm writing an application for finance management, and the font
  will be used in generated raports, invoices and so on. I have a specific set of
  features I need for my font, but I can't find a font that fits. Is it impossible?
  Can you help me?\r\n\r\nThe features I need: \r\n - sans-serif\r\n - light and condensed
  versions (and light-condensed), preferably extra light too\r\n - tabular and lining
  figures (for table text)\r\n - old style and proportional figures (for body text)\r\n
  - light, normal and tabular numerals must match in width (see recent article \"Fonts
  for Financials\" by H&FJ for a better explanation of what I'm trying to say here)\r\n
  - a formal but modern feeling (as formal as possible for a sans-serif font)\r\n
  - Central European accents (I'm polish)\r\n\r\nThe font will be used at quite small
  sizes (8, maybe 9pt) so it needs to be clear and readable. I have checked the H&FJ
  fonts listed in the article I mentioned above, but they are either serif and without
  condensed forms, or don't support matching width tabular figures (like Gotham),
  at least as far as I could check using their online type tester. \r\n\r\nMost of
  the reports and papers I'll be generating will be legal documents that are presented
  to the government. That's why the font needs a formal feeling to it. Some reports
  also have a predefined layout by law (list of table columns that must be included)
  and that causes the requirement of small sizes (for example a table needs to be
  placed on a single page with 15 (!) columns, some of them with some amount of text,
  not just numbers - it <em>is</em> tight). \r\n\r\nI also checked a number of popular
  sans-serifs like Swiss 721 or Verdana Neu (and many others) but most of them don't
  support the matching width across weight tabular figures. The most promising one
  is Proxima Nova as it has <em>almost</em> matching weights. Almost! Also, Whitney
  from H&FJ is fantastic (see the numbers there! gorgeous!), it <em>just</em> lacks
  a condensed version. \r\n\r\nI feel I'm missing something obvious, some well known
  font that has the features I need and is used in financials all over the world.
  Is there a font like that? \r\n\r\nI tried searching the forums but found nothing.
  My search-fu is weak.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nPiotr"

    doubt, ask the foundry. Online type testers can\u2019t cover every detail question.
    And: <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100027\">Whitney
    does have a Condensed</a>."
