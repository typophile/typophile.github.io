  on the merge of these two faces into what i call Helville, mantaining the weight
  and proportions of helvetica with some characteristics of baskerville...\r\nhere
  are some screencaps of the work in progress... more to come - \r\n\r\nYour comments
  will be highly appreciated as this is my first experience \"creating\" a typeface
  (i know im cheating, but its a start!)\r\nthanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/num_5975.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/low_5400.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/caps_5765.png]"

    i would hate to end up with the same results if Vignelli or any other designer
    has attempted this.\r\nthanks!"

  body: "It's that he made a Bodoni based on Helvetica's attributes.\r\nI personally
    think Vignelli completely misunderstands type.\r\nWhich is not to say your effort
    is doomed to failure - in fact\r\nyour actual results are nothing like his. You
    should know\r\nhowever that this is very 90s.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: If this looks like a '90s font, then its sure to be ready for when the nostalgia
    wave hits in 2-5 years. Already some shades of grunge revival in those Olympic
    opening ceremonies.

  body: Look into the work Donald Knuth did on Metafonts back in the early 80s. One
    thing he noted was that Helvetica and Baskerville have nearly identical proportions!
