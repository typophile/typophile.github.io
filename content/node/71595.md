body: "At Miura_Lab we like to be at the cutting edge and we actively test and explore
  new design technologies. With the recent announcement of the Google Font Directory
  (http://code.google.com/webfonts) we thought we would offer a font comparison feature,
  so designers and developers could test different font variations before implementing
  them on their sites.\r\n\r\nAll fonts offered by Google in the directory are available
  for use on your website under an open source license and are served by Google servers.\r\n\r\nI'm
  sure there are big discussions to be had with regards to Googles announcement, but
  for the moment we thought a nice simple tool could help.\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/aUDmXn"

  body: Apart from reminding me how awful they all look on Vista with Firefox, I can't
    actually change the font size of the body text, there's a selection box, but changing
    the point size doesn't do anything, it's all at 12 pts no matter what I do.

  body: Firefox, latest version. The size selection box isn't doing anything (it works
    on the title text.)

    the most promising for text, is in the font list, but not in the test menu?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"
