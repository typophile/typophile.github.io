body: "Does anyone know which typeface (or typefaces) is used here? I feel that it
  is close to a Didot or Baskerville, but the contrast in stroke width is so great.
  I can't find a digital equivalent. Perhaps there were mechanical sets of these faces
  intended for large sizes, but then never digitized?\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike

  body: I had that in a T-shirt back then. So was printed in blue and the album lyrics
    were underneath it in some gray sans.
