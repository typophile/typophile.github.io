body: 'Here is a quote from the active foundry thread in this pdf, moved here so as
  not to muddle the discussion there. <BR> <BR>Stephen Coles: <BR><i>This reminds
  me: i&#39;ve been wanting to do an online survey - targeted at your average designer
  who doesn&#39;t follow the type industry like many of us do - and ask them if they
  are familiar with certain fonts and designers. Those listed would represent different
  marketing methods &#40;online, print catalog, massive distributor, advertising,
  MyFonts, etc&#41;. Would be fascinating to see what method or mix of methods comes
  out the victor.</i> <BR> <BR>This probably will not count as a survey, nor is typophile.com
  the best place to conduct it, as if you&#39;re reading this thread, you probably
  have an above average interest in type. <BR> <BR>However there were the years before
  I saw the light. I came to graphic design by way of a physics degree, so my sensitivity
  to type was pretty much nil. Then I got a copy of Stop Stealing Sheep, required
  reading in an art class. Eventually I lucked into a position as a production artist
  at a mom and pop ad agency.  <BR> <BR>Now to your question. Hard to say if that
  agency represents &#34;average.&#34; Regardless, We had the Adobe library. And that
  was it. If we wanted something else I&#39;d look around at what Adobe had released
  recently. The next places to look were actually the huge stock photo places like
  eyewire.com that had a few other collections for sale and who sent catalogues to
  us regularly because, um we only used stock photography. sniff. But I would say,
  for 99% of the work we did, something in that collection was appropriate. Most likely
  adobe garamond or univers if it was an edgy project :-&#41; Ahhhhhhhh!  <BR> <BR>Type
  designers I had heard of: Goudy, Frutiger, MFBenton, Gill, Novarese, Bodoni etc.
  <BR> <BR>Type resources I&#39;d not heard of: My Fonts. Phil&#39;s House, Hoefler,
  P-22, T26, Plazm, Thirst, wait, yes I&#39;d heard of Emigre &#40;maybe for a star
  trek poster&#41;, DTL? nope. Lucas de Who?. Typophile, sadly no. <BR> <BR>Now this
  probably is not the case for people who received formal graphic design training.
  Chances are they would have exposure to some of these other resources. <BR> <BR>How
  could I have been reached at that time. <BR>1. Some snazzy printed DM piece arrives
  at the office for say, Photonica designed by say, Tolleson Design. Wow! This is
  the coolest thing i&#39;ve ever seen. I wonder if the type is in the adobe library...
  ahhhhhhhhh!  <BR>2. Design Annuals. Manna from heaven. What are the people at the
  cool shops using. I want my stuff to look cool. <BR>3. I&#39;ve noticed that some
  annuals include type credits, but Communcation Arts does not. I probably would have
  found Meta 3 years earlier! No seriously, this was where the motivation was. So
  if this is how my type sensibilities were being broadened, it would have been helpful
  to know what I was looking at. Might be worth a letter to the editors at CA. <BR>
  <BR>While pouring over an issue of communication arts, I read a book review for
  Fonts &amp; Logos by Doyald Young. I bought it. The rest is history. <BR> <BR>Perhaps
  a bit long winded, but i believe it gets at your survey from my experience anyway.
