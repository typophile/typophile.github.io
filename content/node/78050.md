body: "Hello guys :)\r\n\r\nI'm not necessarily trying to ID that font, I just want
  to find out whether it was custom made typeface for a particular client, or some
  online available font. Have you seen it before?\r\n\r\nThe reason why I am asking,
  is because friend of mine, who is the CEO of very large Malaysian Broadband company,
  recently did major Branding make over for his company. I won't mention what agency
  did the job, but it's given, being that Time DotCom (http://time.com.my)is a public
  listed company, the new branding cost them few hundred thousands dollars. \r\n\r\nInterbrand[img:sites/default/files/old-images/time_5174.gif]\r\n\r\nTo
  be honest with you, I wasn't impressed. Not that I know allot on that topic, but
  I do design for almost 20 years and I do have some basic sense of elegance and aesthetics.
  I don't think it was money well spent. \r\n\r\nAnyway, friend of mine is very proud
  of his new \"look\", saying that design was especially catered for them, and I won't
  be able to find such typography anywhere.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, I'm surfing around,
  checking some work done by Interbrand and within their portfolio, I come across
  brand developed by them for Wal-Mart's electronic product call ATVIO. The font resemblance
  is unmistakable. Hard to believe, both companies came up with same idea for a very
  prominent letter \"T\".\r\n\r\nHave you seen that font? I'm really curious to find
  out whether it's a custom made stuff or some free typeface from the internet. \r\n\r\nregards\r\nSeba\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/atvio_6205.jpg]"

    company.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for taking the time and reply. \r\nAppreciate
