body: "I've designed a logo which uses House Girard, but due to their ridiculous EULA
  I can't even dream up to money to pay for it. It's a perfect script font but still
  remains ledgible. The main thing is the S looks like an S and the r looks like an
  r without loops and frills but still has an elegant quality to it. I have searched
  through so many script fonts and not come up with anything of a similar quality.\r\n\r\nANY
  suggestions are welcome."

  body: "Interestingly, I thought the Girard Script 'r' looks like a 'v', at least
    when it's by itself, but I agree the script easy to read and the way it partially
    connects is nicely done. Their OpenType ligatures are usually well-implemented.
    \r\n\r\nIf you are still considering alternatives I like a couple of  Victor De
    Castro's handwritten fonts: [[http://www.unifonts.com/h_family/hudsonfam.htm|Hudson]],
    [[http://www.unifonts.com/h_family/hudsonserifam.htm|Hudson Serif]] and [[http://www.unifonts.com/a_family/arturisfam.htm|Arturis]].
    One thing I like about these is they are not often seen (where House fonts can
    become trendy, like Neutraface and Chalet) and they seem to blend a casual quality
    with a professional lettering skill, not always an easy balance to find. I use
    Arturis and Hudson Serif a lot myself.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
