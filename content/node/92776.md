  body: It is beautiful and legible, but what makes it stand out is that there aren't
    that many back-slanted scripts, in fact I can't think of any.

  body: Yes it is based on her handwriting. I had to modify and add characters like
    the s and the o but it turned nice.

  body: "Thanks Lily\r\nActually Nick I don't mind answering. Its a fun story. I used
    to do graphic design work for her and she would \\art direct the pieces. I always
    loved her handwriting and told her we should make a font out of it someday. So
    I had her write out 3 pages of text and then I picked out the best characters
    or pieces of letters and modified it and I also added some characters to make
    it a font. I told her I would give her 50% of the royalty if we sold any. And
    the rest is history :)\r\n "
