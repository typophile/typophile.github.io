  body: ' John; I am not sure if you are right. the &sect; is not to be replaced.
    They talked about replacing the currency symbol. But they changed that since then.
    The &sect; is used for example in law books. <BR>The currency Symbol and the Euro
    sign should now be both in a typeface. The euro has become an xtra unicode number
    &#40;$20AC&#41; and it is an xtra glyph. <BR> <BR>Jacques '

  body: ' The &sect;ection &sect;ymbol is used to refer to &sect;ections. It often
    accompanies the &para;ilcrow, which is used to signify &para;aragraphs. Often
    used in reference to legal documents and some other scholarly works. Please don&#39;t
    replace it. <BR> <BR>The character you&#39;re thinking of, John, is the generic
    currency symbol &#40;dec 219&#41;, placed at shift-option-2 on the Mac keyboard.
    That&#39;s where you&#39;ll find the euro in many updated fonts; however, this
    placement is sometimes debated by those who feel there is a reason to keep the
    currency symbol. &#40;You can find a discussion of this over on the ATypI list
    a couple months back.&#41; <BR> <BR>-- Kent. '
