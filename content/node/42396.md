body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nI'm starting to develop a new logo for a new (small) company
  for training in psychology. In English \"perfil d'alma\" its \"soul profile\".\r\nI
  dont like very much the result, but...its the owner idea (she likes it!).\r\nMy
  post here is more a typhographic question. The letters are not a typeface but draw
  from a typeface found on a old book see [[http://typophile.com/node/42228|here]].\r\nWhat
  do you think about it? Good shapes, kerning/spacing?\r\nAny comments apreaciated.\r\nThanks
  in advanced.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_4805.png]"
