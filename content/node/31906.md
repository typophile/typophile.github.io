  is a text editor for Mac OSX). This should give some syntax highlighting and a couple
  of snippets to make editing .fea files a bit more pleasurable.\r\n\r\nYou can grab
  it here: <a href=\"http://www.lowest-common-denominator.com/2007/03/typeface_development_bundle_fo.php\">Typeface
  development Bundle for TextMate</a>\r\n\r\nLet me know if it makes your computer
  explode or if I've missed something obvious."

    editor of choice. Also like your other article about version control for fonts.
