  body: "I have just searched all of Dafont and most of MyFonts blackletter fonts,
    and I think this is custom drawn. The tails on the n's are not really in blackletter
    style, I think, and so I guess they were added. The other lettering seems a bit
    simplified, probably for legibility, but maybe from lack of lettering skill. I
    noted a few fonts that could be close enough to be starting points to re-create
    this: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/wittenberger-fraktur-mt/?refby=bowfin|Wittenberger
    Fraktur]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/royal-bavarian/?refby=bowfin|Royal
    Bavarian]], and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/classic/carol/?refby=bowfin|Carol]].\r\n\r\n-

    but I can't find it in Letterhead site anymore, maybe they changed the font name?\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nI
    found it using \"Find my Font\": http://www.findmyfont.com"

  body: I checked New English but it looks like a different font, see for example
    /i/s/ and the different tail endings on all letters.
