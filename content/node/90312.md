  for the project.\r\n\r\nThe project is about:\r\n- Introducing Japanese herbal medicine
  'Kampo'. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampo)\r\n- This project is both print and
  web based design applications.\r\n- The target audience is people living in the
  city in Europe, familiar with contemporary medicine.\r\n- I would NOT like to represent
  too cold, too modernistic, too decorative aspects from the typeface.\r\n\r\nLook
  forward to your suggestions.\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\nTakuya"

    (just the way Swiss pharmaceutics laboratories emphasize being Swiss).\r\nSo,
    perhaps a hint of brush would work, for example."

    has been one of the leading high-tech countries for the past 50 years.\r\nOne
    of my best friends as a teenager (we spent a lot of time under the covers with
    the lights out):\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/sony-tr-510-transistor-radio-red-excellent-shape_140523332716_5607.jpg]\r\n\r\nSony
    US branding from the 1960s leveraged its Clarendon wordmark:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1965-Sony-Ad_5559.JPG]\r\n\r\nAdmittedly,
    high tech is not herbal, but nonetheless, Clarendon doesn\u2019t exactly spring
    to mind for high tech, does it?\r\n\r\nBut if you really want to go all brushy,
    it would be hard to top Papyrus!"

    think people understand that Japan, and Japanese visual culture, has both <em>(very)</em>
    modern/futuristic and <em>(very)</em> ancient/mysterious/foreign (from a Western
    perspective) sides. \xABJapanese\xBB isn't enough to decide on a design direction;
    \xABJapanese high-tech\xBB or \xABJapanese traditional\xBB, at least to me, point
    in vastly different directions."
