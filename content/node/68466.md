  body: "This is a beauty. I especially like the lc \"g\" and \"y\" in both Roman
    and italic.\r\n\r\nSome italics seem too narrow compared the the Roman. This is
    nice and round and curvy. "

  body: "Nice work, Pedro-\r\n\r\nLovely work, with the weights as well. I did notice
    two things from my quick look: light weight tilde seems a bit heavy, and upper
    case Q has a floating tail, while \xE7 has connected cedilla; while there is no
    way to confuse the tail of Q to tilde, it would be logic for them both to connect
    to base glyph. This is just my opinion.\r\n\r\nOverall look of the font is awesome,
    and I relly liked the fi-ligature."

  body: "@dinazina Thanks for the lovely feedback!\r\n\r\nThe italics have the same
    proportions as the roman, and i personally i don\xB4t get that feeling. Did you
    noticed that in any particular character?\r\n"

    This [on the other hand] is nice and round..."

  body: "@Tomi from Suomi Thanks a lot for the feedback!\r\n\r\nI understand your
    opinion about the Q tail being disconnected.\r\nI decided to keep it that way
    because it had a direct relationship with some special characters such as the
    dagger, and as you said the risk of such confusion is really small in this case!\r\n\r\n\r\nPs:
    The italic \"Q\" has a a more calligraphic feeling and therefore a connected tail!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Q_5476.jpg]"
