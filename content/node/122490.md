  might be useful - they are the Percent Off and Two Level SALE glyphs. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/persale_4097.jpg]

  body: "Interesting. It gets me pondering on how \"new\" glyphs may follow the usual
    supply-and-demand market -- i.e., rather the reverse of \"if you build it they
    will come\" (that is, adding lots of weird glyphs to a font in the hope someone
    has a use for them).\r\n\r\nFrom memory: the Rupee sign (a new up-coming consumer
    market), and naturally the Euro sign. Pre-World Wide Web, was the \"@\" generally
    already included as standard? The \"#\"?\r\n\r\nPre-computing era ... wait, let
    me be more precise: before <em>MS DOS</em> (ca. 1980), was there a Need for the
    backslash?"

  body: I do not know any use for a backslash before computing use and neither does
    the dictionary I checked - the slash covered the separation needs before the computer
    era.

  body: "The backslash, indeed, was basically invented by Bob Bemer for the Model
    33 Teletype, for which ASCII was invented. His idea was that /\\ and \\/ could
    be used to represent the math symbols for 'and' and 'or' by only adding one character
    instead of two.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, no one ever used the backslash for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAs
    for @ and #?\r\n\r\nWell, they were standard on manual typewriters. But they weren't
    standard in fonts - a font typically had, as you can see in old specimen books,\r\n\r\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\r\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\r\n.,:;!?()-&$\r\n\r\n...and
    the dash as well as the hyphen, and that was it. You could get accented characters
    for some typefaces as well. But @ and # were <em>sorts</em>, and so you would
    basically have one serif version and one sans-serif version, and that was it.
    If you were lucky, there would be a bit more stylistic variation - but basically,
    if a book needed an @, and it was set in Times Roman, you still used the @ you
    had, which was likely to look more at home with Bodoni (it could well have been
    designed for Scotch Roman of some sort... or even more likely, Century Expanded).\r\n\r\nAnd
    you would use the same @ with Baskerville, with Caledonia, and so on."

    e-mail addresses, they used what were available. And |#| was (and still is) used
    as number indicator well before anyone could even imagine what an \u201Chashtag\u201D
    could be.\r\nAnyway, John (quadibloc) is right in pointing to typewriters and
    ASCII (and other encoding standards) to have an idea of what was generally included
    in early computer fonts."

  body: "SA\r\nLE\r\n\r\nshould not become a glyph, I think. It might be trendy to
    chop up words these days, but that does not make them better. Inter-character
    space is an essential part of a word. Of course we are intelligent enough to do
    without them, but this is always at the cost of reading speed and, more important,
    correct interpretation.  Laymen produce enough crap. Why should professionals
    join them?\r\n\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/albert-jan_pool/sets/72157639579728654/\r\n&\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/albert-jan_pool/galleries/72157640684850524/\r\nor
    even worse:\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/albert-jan_pool/sets/72157635511319762/\r\n&\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/albert-jan_pool/galleries/72157640215540214/\r\n\r\nWhen
    word are being chopped up in more than one part and/or when they are not chopped
    up into syllables but randomly, I expect that many people will not even take the
    pain of trying to decipher them. A waste of designer\u2019s time and client\u2019s
    money. It is like the ads of which many people confirm they have seen them or
    even like them but practically no one can remember the event, product or brand
    which was to be promoted by it. Drawing attention is a must in communication arts,
    but not being able to communicate the message is a waste."
