  body: "I need something that sets a friendly and serious tone. It needs to be interesting
    as well. I'm considering Dolly, btw. There won't be any graphics, except perhaps
    some illustrations by me. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks db;) Great!\r\n\r\nI think the author
    only wants to make money. It's not to serious. Just barely enough to fool a few
    into buying it. Sort of like TV Shop. \r\n"
