  running g5 imacs, (pre-intel). After we installed, iDcs2 is super laggy and the
  screen redraw is worse than before. AND all but one of our printers work now. Paragraph
  styles acting buggy too.\r\n\r\nthx"

  body: "Yeas, that seems strange. We had no such experiences when updating to InDesign
    CS2 some time ago.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2018t need no tech guy to do the updates, they
    are automatically done from InDesign, and these updates are always good to do,
    sometimes it helps a lot, since it could be small bug fixes etc.\r\n\r\nWhen I
    think of it, I always do these updates right away, maybe that\u2019s why I didnt
    experience any problems...?"

  body: "More information needed: which OS X-version? How much memory on the machines?
    Networked? Off at night or not?\r\n\r\nIn general: after installing progs one
    should run Apples Disk Utility:First Aid (resetting privileges). \r\nRegelar maintanace
    is built in, providing the machines are on at night; otherwise run a tool like
    Onyx, at least once a week.\r\n\r\nCommon way to test whether the slugginess is
    user\u2013 or machinerelated, is to set up a new user and try InDesign under that
    account.\r\n"

    no problems here.
