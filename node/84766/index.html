  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am requiring all of my introduction to graphic design students to research a designer and his/her work within a specific practice area of design, write a 1,000-word essay about the designer, and develop the essay into a presentation. The designers I chose were picked primarily because it would be easy for students to research in a library as opposed to online. I ended up with a list that is mostly white Americans and I would like to add some diversity. 

Also, I still have not come up with a great interface designer for my list. Suggestions there would be especially helpful.

Following is my list of designers and practice ares. Please suggest alternate designers and any practice areas that I have neglected. The most important criteria is that the designer has been written about in commonly-available, English language, books and magazines. This is not a research and writing class, so I do not have time to guide 
students through interviews, translations, locating limited edition books, etc..

They still make libraries?

I notice the list is (mostly) contemporary folks. Intentional? If not, there's probably some historical figures that could be added: Tufte, Rand, Carson, Glaser, Sagmeister, etc. 

And other areas to explore:
motion graphics
user experience designers
illustrators
editorial design
signage/wayfinding

For UI, Susan Kare is a fun one given her creating the early Mac OS icons. John Maeda could be another one (less UI and more experimental, but still fun).

1. El Lissitzky

We also had to write about a time period in design. Luckily for me I was given the Psychedelic era. 

Best of luck!

Some (and sometimes all) of my students are not design majors and will never work in design, so the goal is as much to teach non-designers about the design field as it exists as it is to teach design students about their own field.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would suggest Dieter Rams instead of Jonathan Ive, for a variety of reasons. Also, "product design" is a somewhat muddy term. I think even software developers use it. I would use the term "industrial design" to be more specific about that practice area.

Maybe Michael Beirut for identity and branding.</div>
