  body: "It's a very unique font, so it's difficult to say something it's similar,\r\nbut
    you can take a look at the following:\r\n\r\n<strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/baylac/|Baylac
    Regular]]</strong> - by Gerard Mariscalchi\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/baylac/\r\n\r\n<strong>Ferdinand</strong>\r\nDigitized
    by Dan X.Solo (c) 1998 Dover Publications\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_Ferdinand_5909.jpg]\r\n\r\n...and
    the last one, I don't know if it's similar at all,\r\nand it looks also poorly
    executed, but I liked the overall style\r\nand I wanted to share with you:\r\n<strong>Oceana</strong>\r\nDigitized
