body: "Hi all, for a Dutch foundation I'm looking for a serif/sans combination for
  their quarterly reports. Besides bodytext, the reports have quite a lot of tables,
  info- and discussionboxes and portrets. So I will be using the sans a lot.\r\nNow
  the foundation wants 'something fresh' \u2013 whatever that may be. \r\n\r\nAnyway,
  they rejected my Scala/Scala Sans and Haarlemmer/Haarlemmer Sans proposals (which
  I both use daily). Miller/Meta new, they are taking in concideration.\r\nThey don't
  mind herhaps purchasing fonts \u2013 also for future use. I've been looking at Lisboa
  from Fountain, nice but I'm not sure wether I like the numerals. But definitely
  refreshing.\r\n\r\nSome help would be highly appreciated; anybody got any ideas
  or suggestions? Thanks in Advance, Brieck\r\n"

  body: "Here's a Dutch combination (probably a little obvious to you, but it has
    any possible kind of numerals you may want for tables etc): TheSans + TheAntiqua
    from LucasFonts.com.   Taz is another of Lucas' sans-serifs, a little less \"warm
    and friendly\" than TheSans. Also, you probably know Fresco/Fresco Sans by Fred
    Smeijers (OurType).  From the same foundry, the gorgeous Versa by Peter Verheul.
    The sans version may be to close to the serif though to really stand out.\r\nOutside
    Holland, have you looked at Leitura from Dino dos Santos? A family with sans,
    serif, news and headline fonts.\r\nVeel succes! Jan\r\n"

  body: "Thank you both for your suggestions. While I was checking out the fonts,
    I received an email with an idea of their own: Dolly. Obviously an employee came
    up with this suggestion. I've done a few books with Dolly in the past \u2013 never
    could make it sing on the page.\r\nBesides, I find it a bit obligatory by now.
    Anyway, they like it, I don't. So any suggestions to alternatives (that come close
    to Dolly) would be very welcome. The only one I could find so far was [[http://www.suitcasetype.com/index.php?lmut=en&part=fonts&font=9
    | Dederon]]\r\nThanks in advance, Brieck"

    try Stone's Cycles with his Stone Humanist, or, depending on what you're going
    for, maybe his Magma family."
