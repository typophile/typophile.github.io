body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nHoping you might be able to help me, I'm currently working
  on developing an online design archive as part of my MA research, but I am really
  really stuck as to a name. Calling it something like (International) Online Design
  Archive and then using an acronym isn't really an option as there are plenty of
  companies called IODA and ODA and IDA and such out there, so thing is I'm wondering
  if you guys can help me come up with a name!\r\n\r\nWhile I'm here, if anyone would
  be interested in helping grow the project by letting me feature some of their work
  then please let me know. It's not important what format of work it is or what area
  of design it addresses, just that it's original work (i.e. your own, or your company's)
  and you're happy for students and researchers to be able to view it and reference
  it when studying (researching). I also aim to create a contributors area that will
  have a profile for anyone that is involved that wants one so it will in a way act
  as a form of self marketing tool for yourself as well.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I look forward
  to hearing from you guys, please help me get over the name hurdle!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nChris"
