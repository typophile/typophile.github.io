body: I'm starting to teach myself to design typefaces and build letters, and I'm
  running into problems figuring out the best way to construct some letterforms. Is
  there a font that's easy for a beginner to emulate when learning to build letters?
  Also, is there a good book that explains the design of contemporary letterforms
  as opposed to those based on handwriting? I've got Cabarga's <em>Bible</em>, but
  I'm looking for something with more technical details in regards to the shapes of
  the letters themselves.

  body: I give both of James' requests a hearty second! I, too, have been having troubles
    moving from pencil and paper sketches to vectors, even though I consider myself
    mildly facile with the pen tool. A big issue for me is how to maintain consistency
    in, for example, the width of horizontal and vertical strokes.

    the different thicks and thins is essential in understanding all letterforms IMO.
    I like \"The Art of Calligraphy, A practical guide to the skills and techniques\"
    by David Harris. It goes through many different styles and has a wealth of historical
    information.\r\n\r\nAre you trying to work on Serifed type or Sans?\r\n\r\nWhen
    I was learning what letters were all about, I would just open Times or Helvetica
    to get a sense of where the thicks and thins should be and why. \r\n\r\nHope this
    helps a little."

  body: To understand metrics, sidebearings in particular, I recommend creating a
    simple geometric face (stroking paths, aka "Paths>Make Parallel Path" in FontLab),
    and studying how the sidebearings and overshoots are handled in Futura. Then the
    italic, to compare mechanically skewed shapes with typographic italicization.

      your characters on paper, scanning and tracing those isnt a too big step? Get
      your stroke width and such as right as possible in your drawings, and clean
      them up later when you've traced them and when you're in FontLab/Illustrator.\r\n\r\nIf
      it's because you're not familiar with bezier-curves, then I suggest you so some
      general exersizes first to get the feeling of the tool.  Like tracing a linedrawing
      of something, you know, things like that.\r\nLetters are a difficult thing to
      do when you start... I've noticed that, eventhough I do know bezier-curves quite
      well. But when it comes to drawing glyps with it, they aren't too smooth. (yet!
      ;))"

    is that the book doesn't approach type design as a type designer would. Quite
    right. But it still contains a lot of good comparative information on letters,
    and I own it and find it helpful. \r\n\r\nFor a type designer's approach you can
    read what is IMHO overall the best book on type design, G. Briem's <a href=\"http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.1a/2.3.1.01.notes.htm\">Notes
    on Type Design</a>. It is not printed, which would be nice, but is on line--free

    Matthew's suggested title to help my with italics.) Having been in your position
    recently, there really is NO comprehensive book published on type design. \r\n\r\nYou're
    not really going to find one source that it is gonna be your bible. Get the Bringhurst
    book as well. I learned from Cabarga's book and Bringhurst. Once you get the basics
    down, I did what Choz suggested and cracked open some of my favorite fonts in
    FontLab to look at their digital construction. For me, drawing by hand didn't
    mean jack until I started digitizing."

    Karen Cheng's book -- as a beginning type designer, but someone who has done graphic
    design for years, I loved the book -- it's not an encyclopedia, but I think it's
    a pretty thorough examination of the basics of serif and san serif forms. I found
    it very useful to get started with.\r\n\r\nThe book is also very attractive, and
    I'm happy to have it as part of my graphic design library. I don't think you have

    explicitly with digitizing sketches and creating fonts on the screen. I haven't
    given it a lengthy look, but I'm certainly looking forward to going through the
    exercises to see if my bezier competency improves.
