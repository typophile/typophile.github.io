  body: hi tim . just saw your work. ...the usual suggestions... <BR>lc &#34;s&#34;
    needs a bit more work, weights are a bit uneven, lc &#34;k&#34; stems are a bit
    out of character from rest try centering them a bit more, Swooshes are a nice
    little addition but &#34;tips should be similar either oval horizontals or verticals.
    not just the flip. lc &#34;e&#34; seems thin in center, lc &#34;a&#39; has a tiny
    bit too much overhang, b and d would perhaps look more symetrical withrest of
    forms if  <BR>the bowels came in with a bit of curves vs. straight. uc M seems
    thin in center v-shape... keep going...

  body: I like the full swashy version, it&#39;s interesting. Your lowercase letter
    spacing is too tight. Otherwise I agree with Ole and his proposed changes.
