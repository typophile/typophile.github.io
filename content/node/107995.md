  body: what is the font of "ovadia&sons"?

  body: I'm pretty convinced it has been started with [[http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/delphian|Delphian]]
    and "filled". That should even match for everything except /&.

  body: Thanks Ryuk, you seem to be right about Delphian and "filled" part. Do you
    think there is a way to find this actual font that was created from Delphian?
