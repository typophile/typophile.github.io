  body: "Could you please use more descriptive thread names, something like <em>\"life
    is great\" elegant script</em> for example?\r\n\r\n<em>please help me to id this
    font</em> is pretty pointless, as that's all we do on this Board. It's like having
    a newspaper where every headline says <em>Stuff Happened!</em> Wouldn't be very
    practical, would it? ;-)"
