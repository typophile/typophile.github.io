  body: Well, I don&#39;t know if I can call myself type designer, but I use from
    time to time some module of DTL FontMaster. <BR> <BR>I like to digitize some letter
    with Ikarus, cause I like in-line points, I think ContourMaster is great &#40;FontLab&#39;s
    FontAudit sucks&#41;, and the tests I did with KernMaster were good &#40;in roman
    fonts&#41;. <BR> <BR>In my URL there is only old stuff not related with FMaster
    at all.
