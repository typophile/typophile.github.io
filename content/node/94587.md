  would like unify them all in one bitmap only True Type font.\r\nIs this possible?
  What is the best Windows software for this task?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nUwe\r\n\r\n"

    fonts are really a technology of the past, and FON files even more so. The Windows
    7 command line console must be the very last software to actively need it!\r\n\r\nMy
    home system, Mac OS X, allows <em>any</em> installed font to be used for its Terminal.
    And it has more advantages -- for example, Terminal also supports ANSI coloring,
    XTerm style. The same program on Windows 7 shows lots of useless uninterpreted
    escape codes, since I have no idea how to install ol' ANSI.SYS on Win 7."
