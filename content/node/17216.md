  Master (MM) fonts were originated in the 1980s by [[Adobe]] as an extension of their
  [[PostScript]] font format. This font format was capable of generating variations
  of different fonts based on [[axis|axes]] and [[masters]]. A [[weight]] axis might
  change the weight from [[light]] to [[bold]]. An additional axis for [[width]] might
  change [[condensed]] to [[extended]], Users could dial in anything between the masters'
  extremes. The idea was to let the user select the degree of weight or width, &c.
  The maximum number of axes allowed by the format was four, i.e. sixteen principal
  masters.\r\nAfter several years of production, Adobe abandoned the concept as an
  end product. However, MultipleMaster (MM) axis are used today by [[type designer|type
  designers]] in programs like [[FontLab]] to help generate variations of weight,
  &c. It is now mostly an interpolation tool and assumes some degree of cleanup by
  the designer afterwards but much less than starting from scratch for each variation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
