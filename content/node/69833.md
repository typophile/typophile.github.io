  to post these kind of questions, but I need a typeface for everyday use with Cyrillic
  letters. Being a poor student, I don\u2019t think I can afford an expensive, professional
  one. Does anyone have an idea or two?\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for is to begin
  with, a good all-round typeface, like Garamond but for Cyrillic. The only thing
  I have now is Times Cyrillic, which I find rather boring. But if anyone has great
  tips for sans serif fonts, I\u2019d appreciate that as well. And, as previosly stated,
  I\u2019d prefer free fonts if that is possible.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nCaspian

    fonts that came with your system. They are listed </em><a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1538\">here</a></em>.
    Many fonts, including Cyrillic, come with the applications you install, <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/product.aspx?PID=153\">Microsoft</a>\u2019s

  body: "Thera are a few, but after having checked which of the Apple fonts that come
    with cyrillic, I see that it is only sans serifs. Myriad, Charcoal, Helvetica
    and Geneva. And I\u2019ve got Times. I would still need a good typeface for ordinary
    text. Someting like Garamond, Mrs. Eaves, or whatever. I could stick with Times,
    but that feels just\u2026 nah."
