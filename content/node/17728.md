body: <a href="http://www.dieweberei.de/ia/">my first attempt</a> of creating a font
  (ignore the logo above). it basically is a manipulation of ff thesis. so far, i
  only worked on the small cases, and not on all of them. would anyone like to comment
  on it? any inconsistencies? how would you characterise the "feeling"?

  body: "I hate to rain on your parade, but \"a manipulation of ff thesis\" is not
    \"My 1st font\", it's one of Luc[as] de Groot's fonts which you have given wonky
    corners.\r\n\r\nAddition to original post: I don't mean to sound like a mean a\xDFhole,
    but authorship of typeface designs is a pretty touchy subject, especially with
    those of us who are trying to earn our living as type designers. There are many
    ways to learn about type, and one of them is to study, and even muck about with,
    great typefaces in order to see how they're made, and perhaps uncover some of
    the secrets of their success. But don't claim ownership of someone else's design,
    having done minor tweaking or even major overhaul. It's simply not cricket to
    build typefaces from other people's typefaces. (You can borrow from yourself;
    that's okay.)\r\n\r\nMost \"My 1st font\" efforts are absolutely awful. I don't
    think you'll find a designer who didn't start by making ugly geometric/constructed/grunge
    - depending upon their age - fonts, and thinking at the time that they were pretty
    good. Like any skill or craft, type designing develops over time and involves
    loads of trial-and-error. Speaking for myself, I have been designing fonts for
    around 15 years, and have only recently started to understand what I'm doing and
    am finally making some type which is not completely awful. (A contention which
    is open to debate.)\r\n\r\nI applaud your interest in getting into type design,
    but urge you to take your time, learn about the craft, and keep posting experiments
    here for comments. Publish when you're ready and when you have original designs.\r\n\r\nSo...
    About your logotype... I'm not sure that squaring off the corners of Thesis are
    doing the type any favours. There is a difference between modifying a letterform
    to better suit your needs, and simply changing it for the sake of change."

  body: "chester, thanks for your comments. i understand what you are saying about
    the copying issue, and i'm very aware of it. actually now i know, that the title
    of my posting was misleading - as it's not a font but rather <cite>'minor tweaking
    or even major overhaul'</cite>. more specifically, it's not a font at all, as
    it is all done in illustrator. i'm far away from trying to <cite>'claim ownership
    of someone else\u2019s design'</cite> and never thought about <cite>'publishing'</cite>
    anything. it's a mere learning exercise.\r\n\r\nso are you condemning such efforts,
    morally? is there any better way of learning about type design than experimenting
    with very skillfully made fonts by experienced designers?\r\n\r\nto me, this seems
    a little bit strict."

  body: "In my experience, moving someone else's points and outlines around will never
    teach you as much as actually drawing by hand and onscreen yourself. By experimenting
    with existing fonts, one may be able to discover new forms (although this rarely
    happens), but one will not come to the understanding of WHY the designer drew
    the original forms the way he did. That sourt of understanding takes a long time
    to develop, and only comes through direct experience.\r\n\r\nYes, drawing your
    own letters from scratch is hard. It takes years sometimes before the letters
    will be any good. But it will be worth it when you reach that point.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think that chester is being strict at all, by the way. Luc[as] de Groot
    is a living designer, who just designed Thesis a few years ago. One should respect
    his time and his work, especially if one is working in the creative industry,
    too."

  body: "i am interested in the 'personality' of a given font. where does it come
    from? what determines it? what are those characteristics that make it unique?
    and so on. i love thesis, but i wonder why. my idea was, that by manipulating
    some of the forms, i might get closer to it.\r\n\r\nultimately, i agree, i should
    start designing from the scratch. which has always been a big dream of mine and
    i hope i will find the guts to do it. it just seems a bit like preparing a risotto
    if you have never cooked rice.\r\n\r\nplease don't be too harsh with me - i didn't
    want to steel anything from anyone. i have never and will never use it for anything
    else than my personal experiments."

  body: Filoug, I'm sorry if I sounded harsh or strict. I'm not advocating a "hands-off"
    approach; it can be illuminating to get inside a typeface and see how it's constructed,
    where the nodes and BCPs are, how a designer describes curves, etc. As Dan points
    out, one learns more by drawing and making letters, and I would encourage you
    to start your "international aquaculture" exploration on paper.
