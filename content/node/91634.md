  love to get some advice on how to improve the balance in this one.\r\n\r\nEtymentus
  stands for Etymologi & Entusiasme. It should be acceptably legible at small sizes.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
  for part of the final project of my BA in visual communcation.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    very legible.\r\nThe gap between Y and M is ETY_MENTUS huge compared to the rest.\r\nNon-symmetric
    Ts lack purpose to be non-symmetric.\r\nS looks cramped."

    (espc. in M and N) also need adjustments to appear eqaul to the other lines. Look
    at you fav. monoline* sans for ques.\r\n\r\n* kicker: it is not really as monoline
    as it looks."
