  my thesis topic is strongly related to ligatures. Now that I am writing my paper,
  I need to find references for any information on ligatures. I love them, but have
  found little information about them\u2014especially enough to satisfy a thesis paper\u2014online
  or in my University's library. \r\n\r\nAny information would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: Just about any good book about the development of typeface design and writing
    broaches the subject. Ligatures predate printing and have existed as long as type
    has, so there is no shortage of information. Use the Design and Applied Arts Index
    to search relevant publications and then start pulling books off the shelves.

  body: Thank you! I have contacted the University librarian to see if can get access
    to DAAI. I have read plenty of books on typography in the library and in my own
    collection, but the best I can get is generally the same summary in each book.
    Not enough for a thesis paper.

    Someone must have written about ligatures in detail in one of the numerous obscure
    journals of writing, calligraphy, paleography, design, etc. that still don\u2019t
    turn up in databases. If not, do lots of original research and write an article
    about ligatures on the side. I\u2019m sure it would go over well in Codex or the
    Journal of the Lettering Arts.\r\n"

    it would be useful to look at the history of\r\nGreek type, which started off
    very heavily ligated.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    examples [[http://www.typophile.com/node/84057|in this conversation]], though
    some of\u2019em one may like to term contractions instead of ligatures.\r\n\r\nNice
    field of study!"
