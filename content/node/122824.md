  make a new username, couldn't remember the old one!), stepped away from design for
  a bit while starting a food company. Now, I'm in the process of designing bags for
  our caramel popcorn, and could use some feedback!\r\n\r\nName of the company is
  Boujie Baking Co., (from \"bourgeois\"). Tagline is Fancy Schmancy Goodness. Basically,
  we make gourmet foods without the gourmet attitude. (Sir Kensington's is a great
  example of a similar brand message.)\r\n\r\nThis packaging is for our line of Beer
  Kissed caramel popcorn; we have a few other Beer Kissed product lines that will
  be designed once this is done. Inspiration was taken from Art Deco era (bourgeois,
  but more modern than, say, the baroque/rococo era). Type is nostalgic but not overly
  Deco-y, as I don't want it to fall into the \"novelty\" category. Should still be
  familiar enough to today's shoppers to be a comfortable purchase.\r\n\r\nThe part
  I'm really struggling with is the \"The Original Beer Kissed Caramel Popcorn\",
  at the top, as well as the logo placement at the very top. This is kind of a parent
  brand / sub brand situation, so I'm not worried about the Boujie logo being too
  prominent. There are two options in the attached PDF.\r\n\r\nOf course, I'll take
  any sort of feedback you give!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nPS I understand Beer Kissed
  type is rough, I'll clean it all up once I have a direction chosen."
