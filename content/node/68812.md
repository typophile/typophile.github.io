  tablets and the promise of text 2.0</a>. Should be interesting to see where this
  goes. I''m somewhat skeptical of the quality of calibration however.'

    if it might be the name of a cyber-noir private eye, or the lead singer of a self-consciously
    arty rock band, who looks a bit too much like Jim Morrison to be taken seriously
    by the critics."

    do you mean with the \xABquality of calibration\xBB? Is the eye tracking not going
    to be precise enough?"

  body: "Yes exciting - I jotted down some ideas in this vein long before the computer
    became a common word-processing tool. One thing I thought would be useful was
    tinting grammatically similar words a certain hue or tone - for example nouns
    would be reddish while verbs would be in some sort of blue. Also tinting clauses
    or sentences in brackets in one color. This can also be done by assigning different
    fonts to stress these words. Of course this would still be experimental, but who
    knows, done tastefully it might prove useful in some way to speed up reading or
    comprehension. Now with the full glory of computer graphics at our disposal, more
    sophisticated representations of text are possible - for example enlarging the
    text one is reading at present while the rest of the page is in faded small-sized
    letters?\r\n\r\nAnd how about avatars of the characters in a Shakespeare play
    appearing next to the line  one is currently reading?  \r\n"

  body: "@ altaira: Calibration refers to how accurately it can follow your eyes.
    None of the equipment I have used, or seen used, is capable of this accuracy and
    they involve elaborate headgear, head mounted cameras for motion detection, chin
    rests &c. I have seen a few that do not use head-gear and while easier to set
    up, are even less accurate. And in order to maintain accuracy over extended periods
    of time, they need to be re-adjusted and re-calibrated.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some
    won't work with glasses, some won't work with contact lenses, certain eye shapes
    which cover more of the pupil make calibration harder and some will only work
    under certain lighting conditions. I once ran a participant who had been \"smoking\"
    before he came in, and wasn't able to calibrate him at all.\r\n\r\nOur lab will
    be testing a new system, <a href=\"http://www.sr-research.com/EL_1000.html\">EyeLink
    1000</a>, so perhaps this will be more accurate. I'll need to spend a bit more
    time investigating the technology behind this story and cross-reference it's technical
    specs, but for the price, I'd be <em>very</em> surprised to see if it can accurately
    measure eye movements on type set at 12/14.\r\n\r\nBut I must agree. I am very
    intrigued by this.\r\n"

  body: "Definitely very interesting! I've just finished testing with Tobii T120 (same
    company mentioned in article) and have to agree with Cristopher's comments. I
    had one subject whose tracking data turned out to be poor because she had a fringe
    partially falling over one of her eyes. Still, the tracker performed quite well,
    and it gives such an amazing insight into how people interact with a visual stimuli.\r\n\r\nIf
    anything, eye tracking is a most fascinating area of study and I'm keen to see
    how it fairs once it gets introduced in mainstream products."

    1000</a>. An impressive piece of hardware. I hope to be taking out for a test
    drive in the next few weeks. It has two options: with or without a chin-rest.
    With the chin-rest it is significantly more accurate than our older <a href=\"http://sr-research.com/EL_II.html\">Eyelink
    II</a>. Without the chin-rest it's about the same.\r\n\r\nBut here's the best
    part: No headgear! That means easier and faster calibration as well as the ability
    to run longer experiments. With head-mounted gear you have to make it fairly tight
    on the participants head in order to avoid drift and after 30 minutes it can become
    quite uncomfortable to wear.\r\n\r\nI'm still waiting for an opportunity to use
    our <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachistoscope\">tachistoscope</a>."
