  a general topic, without providing any visual background first: is it a good and
  decent idea to combine serif and sans typefaces on collateral &#40;letterhead, business
  card&#41;. The client I want to suggest this kind of typographic combo is an ophtalmology
  clinic, in search of a &#34;cosmopolitan&#34; look. <BR>thank you. i will get back
  with the finalized logo, but I was hoping I would get some unbiased feedback meanwhile.'

  body: 'and since I started out with a general topic, it might as well be just the
    right time to ask a similar question connected this time with my own design studio:
    i called it cellsius design &#40;did you notice the double &#34;l&#34;?&#41;,
    and next thing I heard were my friends telling me how awfully wrong I was being
    in my choice. the general opinion was that the name will most frequently misspelled
    ... first: what do you think of the name as such? and second: since I like it
    and since it started with the &#34;cells&#34; and their visually evocative weight,
    would it make sense to visually separate the CELLS by italicising them in the
    logotype? <BR> <BR>george // cellsius design'

    encouraged in some typography books.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a good thread on the

    <BR>As for the name...I would have to agree with your friends. People will definitely
    have a hard time with the spelling, and some may think it&#39;s a typo. Another
    consideration; there are a couple of celsius design companies, one of which is
    pretty well known.

  body: guess it depends on the rationale. why temperature? why cells? I don&#39;t
    see the connection unless its to do with the temperature of cells, but then there
    must be a reason your into this idea in relation to design. <BR> <BR>its true
    though, mispellings of common words are pretty hot for co. names lately.

  body: Waht bothers me most, is the cellsius design itself. The Caps are too close
    to each other, especially with the red font colour, and its interesting that at
    least on my screen the SI of cellSIUS has more distance than that of the SI in
    SIGN. The mix of the fonts used is problematic, to say the least. Meta and DIN
    is a nono, I&#39;d say. The laymanwon&#39;t be able to distinguish the dynamic
    style from the more static/geometric style of DinSchrift, especially as you only
    use the Din for numbers. Combined with the OSF of Meta, it just doesn&#39;t add
    up. Too close to be a real contrast, it just doesn&#39;t make sense visually.
    You might just as well take the lining figures of the Meta.  <BR>The mix above,
    in the first example, is a bit better. But I still don&#39;t see why you even
    WANT to mix these two types when the serif typeface &#40;hard to see.. is that
    FFQuadraat&#41; would do just nice in its own. Less, as always, is more :-D.  <BR>
    <BR>Getting a bit nitpicky, the phone-numbers need the right spaces, IASI should
    be in SmallCaps, the brackets, the divis
