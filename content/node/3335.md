body: Doggy Overnight Bag is to be a small kit that&#39;s placed in hotel rooms that
  are pet friendly. It will contains things such as a dog blanket, food &amp; water
  dishes, dog treats and other such stuff. <BR> <BR>They were presented with three
  different concepts and this is what they&#39;re going with. I have some tweaks in
  mind, but overall I&#39;m pretty pleased with it. I would like help seeing the things
  I shouldn&#39;t be pleased with. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re there.

  body: 'I like the mark and the type on the second version but the letter spacing
    needs work. I think you need to take some space between the o and first g out
    in doggy and please don&#39;t crash the y into the g. In Overnight the t is floating
    and you can crash the ni combination a bit more. In Bag make the B a combination
    tighter.  <BR>Question: could you have come up with a harder to space font? I
    remember this font from the 70s and it never set well. If you have time take a
    look at ITC Caslon 224 Extra Bold, it has character and the color of the letter
    spacing is much better and it has some of the feel you have here. <BR>Did you
    do a verion of the mark with a black lab and a outline moon? I haven&#39;t seen
    a black moon lately.'

    of this one &#40;for the life of me I can&#39;t remember it&#39;s name&#41;? <BR>
    <BR>Don&#39;t you think the first is stronger? The blackness of the moon and the
    type in the first creates a nice contrast for the puppy.

  body: Thank you much for the feedback. <BR> <BR>Daniel, &#40;I forgot to mention&#41;
    you&#39;ll have to excuse my spacing on this for now. I&#39;ve yet to purchase
    that font, so it&#39;s as spaced by myfonts.com. I do expect some difficulty in
    spacing it well, though. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t yet tried the outline moon with
    a black  dog, but I&#39;m trying it real soon like. Does anyone feel the black
    moon is a serious issue? I&#39;d like to know. <BR> <BR>Windsor is the name, Tiffany.
    I felt it was quite warm and even sleepy&#40;?&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks again

  body: '&#62;Be careful of choosing a font based on its name! <BR>Huh? I&#39;m guessing
    there is a correlation, but it&#39;s not obvious to me. Do tell. <BR> <BR>Hrant,
    for what reason does the size of the dog concern you? The illustration goes quite
    small with the dog still being discernable. I don&#39;t think he could sleep comfortably
    on that moon if he was very much bigger. I will try him as big as I can though
    &#40;the client also wanted to see this&#41; <BR> <BR>Ole, waggy-tailed g&#39;s?
    I don&#39;t believe I would know how to pull that off. What are <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/brighton/bold/testdrive.html?s=Doggy&amp;p=60">
    these g&#39;s</a> doing? I was looking at that font&#40;Brighton&#41;, but I don&#39;t
    think so. <BR> <BR>I like the sloped sides in Windsor but, maybe I&#39;ll have
    to reign them in some. <BR> <BR>Is there any reason why the stroke contrast differs
    between letters in this face. Compare the the capital and lowercase o&#39;s. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks again for your comments everybody.'

    me all confused. ;&#41; Okay, I agree that Sauna is great. &#40;I&#39;ve always
    wanted it myself, hasn&#39;t everyone&#41; But it&#39;s probably out of range
    for this project. I do agree that it&#39;s a good value. I&#39;ll see. <BR> <BR>quick
    question: I&#39;ve had the inkling that an Italic would be less appropriate for
    this, as they are less &#34;at rest&#34;. What do you all think? <BR> <BR>&#62;There
    is not any weight that would be perfect <BR>I&#39;d love to know you&#39;re thoughts
    &#40;or see an example&#41; of a perfect weight for this. <BR> <BR>Johnathan,

    too much. That&#39;s a cool flag, though. <BR> <BR>Thanks everybody'

    <BR> <BR>When you wrote &#34;Windsor is the name, Tiffany. I felt it was quite

    can sleep comfortably anywhere. This morning I found him in a large plant pot.
    <BR> <BR>I think it needs to be bigger because it&#39;s the subject &#40;not the

    about the &#34;Eastern Anatolia&#34; breed, that&#39;s actually Armenian. I know

    <BR> <BR>Whichever direction you choose, try setting the word <BR>in different
    cases and look for ways that you  <BR>can customize the type. <BR> <BR>&#42; You
    have four lowercase &#39;gs&#39; in play. <BR>&#42; Look at how the letters fit
    together and play off each other. <BR>&#42; consider the counters. <BR>&#42; consider
    alternate letterforms not &#34;in the font&#34;. <BR> <BR>good luck! <BR> <BR>bj

    Perhaps too many pen points are getting in the way of a smooth vector circlish

    be better if it were slightly rounded.

    aside, the type looks randomly placed. Consider sliding Overnight and Bag to the

    want to loose the dot on the i in this case&#41;. I think the overall result will
