  body: "Thanks for that link, Jan. Regarding the search issue, I did enter \"art:21\"
    into Typophile's search engine; it produced no results. Adding \"PBS\" to the
    search terms didn't improve things.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Akira provided another
    helpful link over at MyFonts: http://designarchives.aiga.org/index.html?s1=2|s2=1|eid=440\r\n\r\nJohn"
