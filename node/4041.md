body: Hello Typophiles, <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.xtati.com/haus6/">Haus Nummer
  6 Affair</a> is a gig I started in hope to decorate the dull walls of the house
  I live in - am actually renting a corner there, with a lamp and a sink. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I would be very glad to be able to hang the works of the
  real typophiles on the walls of the stair-way. I am even eager to give a typeface
  for this. <BR> <BR>You are all heartily welcome.

  body: Hallo Hrant, <BR> <BR>sure it can. The problem is that if it is meant to be
    printed afterwards I will ask for a 300dpi file, which in case of being A4 format
    could be a bit large. But if the file size is not a problem for you, it is not
    a problem for me. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I am bumping it up to see if more typophiles would want to take part or to
    &#40;at least&#41; vote for the entries &#40;and maybe even comment on them&#41;,
    which have been submitted by now. <BR> <BR>Hope, you don&#39;t see this as an
    annoying message announcing yet another boring thing. :/ <BR> <BR>Alex
