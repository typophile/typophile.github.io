  body: I thought this was Letraset <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/carlton/carlton/testdrive.html?s=NEW+YORK+AUCTION&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Carlton</a>, with the Y made using the V, but I can see that there
    are differences. in the W, U and N, to mention the most obvious. <BR> <BR>I still
    think the Y is fabricated from the V, but I don&#39;t know the base font.
