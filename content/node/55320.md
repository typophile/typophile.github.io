  body: You're not doing anything wrong. I'm pretty sure you can't control it. I've
    never seen font menus display as anything but lightest to boldest. Just a matter
    of getting used to it.

    the field empty is the same as having a zero value in it."

  body: "If you use an old fashioned style of having the lowercases slant more than
    the uppercase, should you put the uppercase value, the lowercase value, or some
    midpoint of the two?\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas

  body: I'd use the lowercase value. On an average paragraph lowercase letters are
    more frequent than uppercase.
