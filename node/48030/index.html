  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I finished a fortnight of heavy going on the computer writing an article too thick with foot notes and citations to be fun.  So, to get the old juices going again I turned to a job that had been sitting on the shelf waiting to be done, 300 envelopes needed lining with some of my vintage onion skin paper.</p>
<p>The onion skin for this job is what was called &ldquo;Tuscan&rdquo; but it is orange.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/IMG_1697_5794.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It was a joy to stand up at our work table, put on some Brahms, cut, paste, fold, count the exact quantity of envelopes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/IMG_1695_3778.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I started to think, why is this so pleasurable and the tedium of mass production not?  I made some notes before I went to bed and this is what I found:</p>
<p>In &ldquo;The American Manufactory: Art, Labor, and the World of Things in the Early Republic&rdquo; Laura Rigal discusses the difference between artisan and manufactory worker.  She makes the distinction between &ldquo;manufactory&rdquo; and manufacturing; about the time of the building of our new Republic, goods were in high demand so slick thinkers invented new machines that made making something (like a barrel) faster and cheaper.  It was at this time that more complex &ldquo;machines&rdquo; began to mediate the art of production.</p>
<p>Prior to this simple machines (tools, such as a hammer or a wedge which is a simple screw) were used by craftsmen and women in the production of goods (books, cabinets, shoes, and etc.)  It was a direct process, artisanal, the true crafts.  Each product was as good (or bad) as the person involved.  There was little standardization, except for guilds and trade unions.  A well made shoe would take many hours which is why hand-crafted goods are so dear today (hand made shoes cost many thousands of dollars because they take so many hours to make.)</p>
<p>There are great movies about the dulling work of mass production, &ldquo;9 Mile Road&rdquo; comes to mind.  And there is a Sally Fields chick flick whose name I can&rsquo;t recall.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the difference between my labors over 300 envelopes and an assembly line:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I control the process and the the profits so there is a sense of ownership in the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a bit of creativity in that each job is relatively small, so, there is a bit of a challenge figuring out the work flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is pleasure in accomplishment:  starting with an empty &ldquo;Finished&rdquo; box and watching the finished envelopes stack up is fun.  You can actually see and feel the fruits of your own labor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with my hands with real materials is a wonderful contrast to heavy lifting words and phrases for ten days solid on a computer-machine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think this is why more and more people of this new, computer generation begin to embrace the old crafts; letterpress, the book arts and now engraving have become interesting to increasing numbers of typography and graphic design students.</p>
