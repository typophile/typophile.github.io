  body: I was "demeaned" by my second grade teacher for adding swashes to my handwriting
    exercises.

  body: "Interesting theory.\r\n\r\nIn fact when we moved from Lebanon to the US\r\nwhen
    I was 6 and then moved back when I was 9\r\nI had to flip-flop between detached
    and cursive\r\nhandwriting, and the last thing I remember was\r\nhaving to figure
    out what an \"a\" is \"supposed\" to\r\nlook like on my own (because I was too
    old to be\r\nformally re-taught). After a period of writing the\r\n\"a\" in binocular
    form (too slow) I went (back?)\r\nto the monocular form.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Actually I had quite good handwriting early on.  The teachers said my cursive
    was truly beautiful. But then my fifth grade teacher (teacher of 10 year-olds
    if you are not used to the american system) kept making us write all theses sentences,
    like hundreds and hundreds of paragraph long sentences, as a form of punishment.  Myself,
    I was fairly well behaved, so out of my resentment I wrote out those sentences
    just as fast as I could.  The fall was imminent after that.

  body: Mine is still pitiful. I don't write enough anymore to make it better either.
    Most things are just quick notes these days; no more school papers or long written
    letters.

    to ''float'' inbetween the lines on lined paper. I use them as guides to get my
    writing in the middle of the line rather than on it. '

  body: "Actually a centerline is much smarter than a baseline (as if letters need
    to sit so they don't get tired). Hopefully one day our writing (and I don't mean
    by hand) will be reformed in that way.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
