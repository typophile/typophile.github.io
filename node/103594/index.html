  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So I made good on my threat in <a href="http://typophile.com/node/103299">this thread</a> to build a font on the basis of some nice lettering from the 60ies I found on a residential building in Berlin&hellip;  I&rsquo;ve got a pretty complete set of paths now, whose look in the Glyphs editor I rather like.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/blumenkind_3944.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Problem is, I need to stroke those paths to make a usable font. I&rsquo;m not happy with the path expansion tool in Glyphs (it doesn&rsquo;t support rounded end caps and does unsightly things to sharp turns), so I&rsquo;ve tried exporting an OTF from Glyphs to FontForge and doing it there.  The workflow is pretty atrocious, crash-ridden (on the side of FontForge) and doesn&rsquo;t work well for very thin weights, so I&rsquo;m very much hoping to find a better solution.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a really good path stroking tool? Preferably free to use, though if you have a paid license, I might be interested to hire your services for a free license of the final font&hellip;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looks like when I stroke the font at 25/20 units with a 40° angle in FontForge. Not too bad, though as I said things break down at very light weights.</p>

<p>Also, there&rsquo;s a {tt} ligature in the font that I forgot to activate for that poster above. See the {ff} ligature for an idea of what it would look like.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, and I wrote &ldquo;an utopian&rdquo;? Really? Why does this forum forbid editing the first post again&hellip;?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">As far as expanded path fonts go, this has some potential. The terminals need a bit of tinkering to look more natural. If you&rsquo;re set on going down the expanded path route, I&rsquo;d suggest only using this model for the lightest weight. Add some contrast in unexpected places (maybe thicker in curves, where the pen would slow down) and I think you&rsquo;ll have something interesting. It reminds me of fifties lettering on space themed adverts, and weird contrast seemed to be all the rage then.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Alright, I found a clunky but workable way of exporting my paths from Glyphs to FontForge, expanding them there, and re-importing them to Glyphs for finishing.  I put up a provisional Behance page for illustration:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Blumenkind-a-bright-utopian-script-font/10159067">http://www.behance.net/gallery/Blumenkind-a-bright-utopian-script-font/10159067</a></p>
<p>And here are two of the posters for the click-lazy among you.  ;o)</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Bposter01_cut_5924.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/old-images/Bposter03b_cut_4081.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, I went with a monolinear approach for the default cuts — it seems to work well enough for Rolling Pen after all&hellip;  also, it makes the round stroke terminals look natural. I also made a heavily contrasted &ldquo;calligraphic&rdquo; cut with diagonal stress. I found sharp cutoffs at the stroke ends look the most natural there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of releasing Blumenkind in the next few days. Any last-minute thoughts?</p>
<p>@ Dave: Adding stress in unexpected places sounds like fun, but also like more work than I was planning to put into Blumenkind. Perhaps an idea for a &ldquo;Blumenkind Pro&rdquo; further down the road&hellip;?</p>

I&rsquo;m not sold on the tittles and diacritics.
I wonder if /U/u/ look a little too /V/v/ish.
For /G/ you might try having the &ldquo;triangle&rdquo; inverted (i.e. have its top flatter and its base pointier).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ Craig: Thanks for the feedback!</p>
<p>Tittles and diacritics: I took that straight from the source that way, but of course I&rsquo;m not obliged to reproduce it faithfully (for instance, I&rsquo;ve made the {t} much nicer than it was). The {ü} was one of the letters I found most inspiring about the source, though.  I agree the overlapping forms are quite unconventional, and I could make Blumenkind more widely usable with more conventional diacritics. I might just make an alternate cut of the font for that, then. Good idea!</p>
<p>Yes, the {UuVv} look too much alike for my taste, but I haven&rsquo;t found a satisfying way of resolving the issue. I certainly want to keep the current shape of {Uu}, which I find very attractive and in line with the font&rsquo;s design philosophy. That doesn&rsquo;t leave much space for {Vv} to be different, though. I don&rsquo;t suppose two crossed slashes would work&hellip; Then again, the {UuVv} distinction is probably not very crucial to readability in most languages, is it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given the inverted {G} a couple of tries on paper, and I don&rsquo;t like it much — it looks top-heavy and menacing. One reason why Blumenkind looks so friendly is its teddybear-like cuddly and bottom-heavy shapes. The current design of {G} also allows its bottom terminal to angle inwards with a minimum of tension on the bottom corner, which I like.</p>

<p>Indeed, the medium of the original dictated such Tittles and umlauts, but that&rsquo;s not the case with your font so it looks more arbitrary. I can see some of the quirky appeal you&rsquo;re talking about but I also find them confusing and distracting.</p>
<p>On the /U/u/, if you don&rsquo;t want a downward stem on the right (and I can see why you don&rsquo;t) just de-pointify the bottoms as much as you can without losing the triangular character.</p>

<p><img src="/images/old-images/alt_3878.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I tried widening the {u} at the base, but didn&rsquo;t like the result. It seemed to lose all the springy tension that characterizes the font. I guess I&rsquo;ll just keep it the way it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting it on the test server now. If there are no glitches it should be out within a week or so.</p>
