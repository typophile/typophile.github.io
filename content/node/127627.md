body: "A short film illustrating the process of making the mold, engraving a sample
  matrix and casting my very first letter.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwbYsiBqtM&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nIdea:
  Creating a simplified version of a traditional hand-mold that faithfully served
  15th-19th century typefounders and printers. This will be a centerpiece of my portable
  foundry. The plan is to cast some ancient Cyrillic and Glagolitic type.\r\n\r\nMethod:
  I am using a Proxxon MF-70 mill converted to use CNC, running GRBL 1.0\r\n\r\nFindings:
  There is a fair bit of variation between faces, gotta work more on the pouring technique
  and make a spring to lock the matrix in place that will allow for faster casting
  and should improve the quality. When engraving he matrix, the design path needs
  to be slightly thinner to allow for the cutting bit offset and ink spread."
