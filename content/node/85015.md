  and I've run across some pieces using <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/housegothic23\">House
  Gothic 23 (condensed)</a> that hit a similar aesthetic.\r\n\r\nI'd like to find
  some other options for typefaces as well, any other recommendations for other fonts
  to check out or even just a bit of insight on how you'd classify that font so as
  to help track down some other options? Thanks.\r\n"
