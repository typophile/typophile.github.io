    very distinctive.

  body: "Here's some more on CBS News 36...the electronic version was first deployed
    on the early 1970s Vidifont, and in many ways this low-res version was the 'face'
    of television graphics during that time. I've put some [[http://jcbd.com/vidifont|scanned
    images from a Vidifont brochure]] up on my site, it includes a screenshot or two
    of the entire alphabet...unfortunately, no where near the full resolution of the
    font. \r\n\r\nThe big deal element of the design was that it had built-in cuts
    and counters (little positive and negative spikes at the corners) to compensate
    for the 'blooming' or blowing-out of the image you see on an old NTSC picture
    tube. \r\n\r\nOne font that comes to mind that takes that approach is Matthew
    Carter's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bell-centennial/|Bell Centennial]]...but
    of course he chose that technique to help tiny inked letters on newsprint hold
    up...kind of the same challenge."

    are \"bloom traps\". Thanks for the images, jc! "
