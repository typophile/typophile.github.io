  Thanks to Nick Sherman for the requests:\r\n\r\n1. Added the \"blockquote\" tag,
  so now you can quote each other consistently.\r\n\r\n2. Comments are now directly
  linkable! The timestamp at left is now a direct link to that comment. Copy the link
  using your browser and do what you will with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm no web developer
  - I'm a designer, and extremely busy in the day job, so thanks for the patience.\r\n\r\n//jared\r\n"
