  brand with my girlfriend. I lack typographic skills, that is why I am asking you
  guys some feedbacks and suggestions. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brand is called \"BAIN\" and
  we make swimwear and surf shorts for men and women, 25-45 year old, with good taste
  and finance  is what we target. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe position ourself between the
  traditional surf brand; quicksilver, ripcurl etc...\r\n\r\nand the high end swimwear
  brands; Maaji, Huit, Pain de sucre, Calvin Klein, Orlbar Brown Robinson les bains
  etc...\r\n\r\nwith a light touch of hipster flavor in the mix. \r\n\r\nBasically
  the brand's image rotates around 3 ideas. \r\n\r\n1-\"Made in France\": Since every
  piece will be designed and made in France, in small factories, we want the brand
  to convey a sense quality, authenticity and most of all a rustic feeling. \r\n\r\n2-
  \"Simplicity & Nature\": At first we wanted to make a surfbrand that is sees not
  surfing as sport or as competition but as just something fun and relaxing. Something
  simple that connects you with nature. That led us to use recycled fabrics to make
  our swimwear. So we want our logo to reflect this. \r\n\r\n3-\"Free & easy\": Basically
  when you where our swimsuits or shorts, we want you to feel like these guys in the
  60-70's surf movies; stocked with nothing to worry about. \r\n\r\nSo our Brand name
  is \"BAIN\". It's french, it's simple, and it means \"bathing\", so having fun in
  the water. \r\n\r\nConcerning the logo, I thought about a hand written type based
  logo, because it is simple, and it reminded of these old rustic looking logo every
  company had prior to the 50's. And I wanted to have some curve because it's a surfing
  brand after all. \r\n\r\nI've attached the logo I have so far. I'd like to have
  some type designer's opinion on it because I feel it's lacking harmony and  fluidity
  but I don't see how I could fix it.  Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advanced and have nice day!\r\n\r\nClaude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
