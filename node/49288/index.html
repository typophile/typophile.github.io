		<div class="commentbody">Butterick suggests avoiding Windows system fonts on the theory that they're designed to look good on computer screens, not paper.  I don't think that advice applies to all Windows system fonts (e.g., Palatino, Georgia).  However, I would eliminate Georgia (and several other decent system fonts) for normal legal use because Georgia uses old style figures in the Windows system version.  Old style figures don't jive with text that includes lots of legal citations.  They just don't.  I don't care how trendy OSF may be in typography circles, or how pretty some OSF sets are.  OSF suck in legal usage.

So I don't agree with Butterick in every detail.  But I think that he's right 95% of the time, or more.  If lawyers slavishly followed his advice, legal briefs would look a lot better, and read a lot better.

I wish he'd suggested some good fonts to use for legal writing, instead of just suggesting fonts to avoid.</div>

Maybe I'm just old fashioned (though I've never had to seriously type on a typewriter just playing around when I was a kid) but I prefer two spaces after sentence final punctuation.  And, he cheats in his example.  He uses three spaces which I definitely agree is too much.  It also has a nice disambiguating effect whenever you have a text that will have punctuation marks used as non-sentence enders.  This happens more often in Spanish because it will flank portions of sentences that as needed.  Often times in English is clear by the lack of capital letter post-punctuation, but it's still possible for it to happen and I'd think that in a legal context the clearer things are the better.

<blockquote>Nice, but I wonder why they went with Book Antiqua instead of Palatino/Palatino Linotype?

Si, would Palatino Linotype have been a better choice than Book Antiqua? If so, why?</blockquote>

Because Book Antiqua started its life as a Palatino knock-off. Hermann Zapf, the designer of Palatino, was angry about this. Initially, nobody asked him for his permission, let alone negotiated with him on financial aspects. If I am informed right, it was the main reason why Hermann Zapf terminated his membership of ATypI on the Antwerp congress in 1993.

(about half way down in the article: Although ITC’s business model relied … Zapf continued to speak out on the issue of typeface piracy—even to the point of dramatically quitting ATypI in 1993 over the membership of companies he considered to be guilty of such practice …)</div>

Albert, I'm aware of this fact. I try to understand Si Daniels' (Microsoft) underlying reason for his question. Maybe Si would choose Palatino Linotype over Book Antiqua (because of the same reason you mentioned). Or not at all, hence my question.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can't know for sure, but I would imagine that the most common legal document the average person is exposed to these days is the EULA contract and that, along with other more occasional documents like mortgage notes etc.. the overall impression is that anything lawyers write is bore/snore and indecipherable by ordinary humans.
The idea that court decisions can be interesting reading and even deliberately humorous at times, would be greeted with disbelief, I think.

The typography plays into this and I'm glad to see it changing.

I'm hoping some kind of HTML takes hold soon as well. Wouldn't it be great to just click on a citation and go right to it? (But this will be a long time comin', I'm  sure.)

The first example of the Utah Supreme Court's formatting says: "Prepare to be bored." You really don't want to go past the title page. At least I don't.
Glancing at it, I think a lot of people would automatically assume it's a an old document, too. I mean, what other reason could there be for the Selectric look?

The redesign is much friendlier and much more readable.

Nice going, Butterick. In a profession where WordPerfect is still the standard word processing program and IE6 reigns supreme, you've moved the immovable.</div>
