  from combining characters and box-drawing characters.\r\n\r\nThe problem encountered
  is that diagonal lines (and therefore glyphs which normally require diagonal lines)
  are difficult to render appealingly. V? X? K? Z? How should I go about 'making'
  these using box-drawing characters and combining characters, while maintaining visual
  appeal?"
