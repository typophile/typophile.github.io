  Vista) promise to bring sans oldstyle figures to the masses next year... but is
  there any font that's common in today's Windows systems that also includes OSF?
  I don't think there is, but maybe I'm overlooking something.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n--Michael."

    The new fonts for Microsoft look excellent. Perhaps Apple will license them to
    maintain interoperability with Windows users.\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: Georgia, which is a serif, has OSF and ships with Windows (and any Mac with
    Office or IE, I believe). On the Mac, Hoefler Text and Big Caslon both have OSF
    and serifs.

    body: ">Does M$ not include a sans with OSF in the default font set?\r\n\r\nNot
      that I know of. Microsoft has poor OSF for defaults. Even of the defaults that
      ship with Adobe for Windows, most of the sans-serifs (all of them?) don't have
      oldstyle figures, and as far as I know, none have real small caps. Hopefully
      with Vista MS will be escaping from typography based on the capabilities of
      a typewriter."

  body: "For San Serif that's another story. Skia is probably the only font that has
    OSF for a sans font. Papyrus are Bradley Hand are decorative but they kind of
    have OSF looking figures. But for serif, there are quite a few more for the mac.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope
    I helped,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\n\r\nPS... I checked the Palatino on my machine
    and it does not come with OSF figures, so Windows might not have it either. "

  body: "BTW... the new Windows fonts look excellent (the copy-kat Segeo too). Perhaps
    Microsoft may be getter more serious about typography than Apple.\r\n\r\nAnd about
    OSF in the default set XP... probably not... check in character map for all the
    text san serif faces. With advent of OpenType the bar has been raised higher so
    ligatures, small caps, and other typographic niceties are automatic (or at least
    in reach) for the lay person. But its not something that completely 'there' yet.\r\n\r\n;-)\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "OK, folks, thanks. The reason I'm asking, by the way, is for selecting fonts
    for my company's CSS stylesheets. I was hoping to choose Candara or Calibri but
    have a reasonably close backup for XP, 2000, and Mac users...\r\n\r\nLooks like
    I'll go with \"Lucida Sans\" variants - no OSF, but a nice feel on both platforms
    and installed by default.\r\n\r\nMy company's site, BTW, is <a href=\"http://www.videoaidedinstruction.com\"
    target=\"_blank\">videoaidedinstruction.com</a>. Any constructive criticism (besides
    its not being true CSS-XTML)?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n--Michael.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n//

  body: "Michael> I checked out your site. It looks like you have already went with
    Candara. I had to install it to check out your site. Then I uninstalled it to
    see how it would look in Lucida.\r\n\r\nWith Candara it looks great! The formatting
    is excellent and the welcome letter looks good as well as the contact section
    at the bottom.\r\n\r\nBut when I uninstalled it. Lucida kicked in and it looks
    acceptable. The line spacing changes and looks a little too loose. Not bad but
    not perfect. Probably nothing to worry about. The only thing that does not look
    good is the parts where you see the caption for the dvds \"New Calculus Series\"
    and others. The text is formated with the dvd image and depending on how people
    have text settings or what default fonts they have installed the words wrap in
    unpleasing ways. It did for me. I think you should convert these parts to png
    or gif images.\r\n\r\nAlso I looked at the site with Candara installed and not,
    with Safari and Firefox. Firefox renders better.\r\n\r\nBut Micheal, I generally
    think its premature to install Candara now. Not even other Windows users have
    it. I got it because I had to look for it (probably something I'm not even supposed
    to have). When Vista comes around the whole world will then have these new fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    checked Skia... it does not have a bold, so that's not gonna work. Lucida is your
    best bet on the mac. Verdana is ugly. Georgia is lovely... have you thought about
    that?\r\n\r\nHope I helped,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\n\r\nPS... your site could
    use some color to make it more inviting... but not a big deal."

  body: "Mikey, thanks for all the great feedback.\r\n\r\nYeah, the site's color scheme
    is bare bones... My client (that is, day gig boss) doesn't want any punchy color
    so as not to compete with the packaging of the products. He's a bit of an Apple-phile,
    as am I.\r\n\r\nRegarding the type, I thought about switching to Georgia for the
    headlines and a sans for the specs, but I think it's cleaner this way. And, yes,
    I do need to address those line breaks. Perhaps you're right about making these
    headlines into images. Hmmm...\r\n\r\nI guess Candara is premature for now, but
    it'll be an added bonus for any Windows Vista beta testers until next year. No
    harm, no foul, right?\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks again. I really appreciate your thoughts.\r\n\r\n--Michael.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n//
