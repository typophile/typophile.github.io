body: I've been trying to come up with a logo for a T-shirt company called "Asembl,"
  and this is what I got after some trial and error.  What do you guys think?  Comments
  and suggestions for improvement would be much appreciated; as I'm sure this could
  use a lot of work.

  body: "Hm.\r\nAll I can say is the 'S' looks too much like a 'g' -- I can't get
    my mind past that to give further commentary. My brain just keeps asking, \"But
    what does <em>agembl</em> mean?\""

  body: "The logo doesn`t work as unit. It`s only union of elements. \r\nIt`s something
    on weak sign, that disturb. I would orient to\r\nclarity and legibility. Eyes
    needs much time to entcode this\r\nformation. "

  body: "I also think that the logo in not effective. It forces the eye to jump back
    and forth from place to place. Logos should do just the opposite: Lead the viewer
    to focus and remain focused on your design until it becomes imprinted on the brain.
    Your design creates confusion, not order!  Simplify!!!!!\r\nD~"

  body: "Do you think it's possible to keep the large \"S\" by possibly changing the
    shape/size or removing the connection to the \"a,\" or should I nix it entirely?\r\n"

  body: Are you trying to impress someone or are you really trying to communicate
    something. As it stands its design for design sake. It has no focus, no direction.
    As someone suggested it is a made-up word with no meaning and no other communications
    to explain it. Is it a place? Is it a time? I have no idea. Explain the concept
    and what its goal is and you will be on your way to a good graphic design.

  body: "It's a shortened form of the word \"Assemble,\" which was chosen because
    the company was formed by a few friends who er, \"assembled\" to form this idea.
    \ Kind of lame, but who am I to say?\r\n\r\nI think you're right though--it doesn't
    have any particular focus.  I think I've got to go back to the drawing board on
    this one."
