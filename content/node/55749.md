  body: b2 is interesting but I don't think it really captures "properties" - it has
    more of a technology feel to it. b3 though seems intriguing enough. It has "architectural"
    elements that can be useful for a property investment firm. I'm not sure disconnecting
    the bowl of the "b" is the right approach though. Maybe think of this more in
    terms of buildings, architecture or even investment concepts. Right now it seems
    a bit too focused on the first letters of the company's name. Which is a perfectly
    fine place to start, but yeah, play with some other concepts. Hope this helps.

    nontraditional, quirky brand. These options don't really project the \"upscale\"
    \"professional\" \"confidence\" (all three at once) that is expected from an investment
    managers.\r\n\r\n<em>Maybe</em> 4C, but it's also kind of pushing it."

    make it more like squares?\r\nyeah.... I mostly either start with letters or a
    symbol... it makes a kind of steps to use :)\r\n\r\ndezcom\r\nWhat if I change
    the shape of circular B into 2 squares? wouldnt it be more... umm... easy on the
    eye?\r\n\r\n\r\nepsilicon\r\npeople always say that my designs r nontraditional....I
    wish I can control this :(\r\nshould I try to make 4c work.... or it doesnt worh

  body: "Speaking just for myself, I think these logos don't evoke associations they
    should given the context. So if they <em>are</em> used, it will mean an extra
    effort in brand positioning. That's what non-traditional about them.\r\n\r\nRe:
    4C - I think it needs to be simpler. It just has too much going on for it at the
    moment. Something like this perhaps (2 minute hack job):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fb2_6657.png]"

  body: "illustarellite , \r\n\r\nNot necessarily like squares but have the letter-shapes
    almost feel like buildings or houses. Your designs need to invoke a feeling. Again
    I think you should explore different concepts beyond just the initials \"FB\".
    Maybe even think about cultural symbols from French and Bahrainian cultures (I'm
    assuming that the company is composed of people familiar with France and Bahrain).
    These designs right now just aren't clicking the \"property investment button\"
    in my mind."

  body: 'I agree with the other posting that your designs aren''t giving off a properties
    and investments vibe. That said, to me 1B and 2B have the most potential in becoming
    interesting icons to be used with the name. 1B could stand to be abstracted even
    more (imo) and 2B currently reads as EB. You really should be working with the
    name as well as the mark to develop the two together. '

    will try.... \r\n\r\nepsilicon\r\n\r\nwhat you've done looks like ( & )... I like

    shapes that make up the falcon connect to the properties; the falcon connects
    to Bahrain. Plus people like falcons, especially these days since they contrast
