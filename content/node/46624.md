  body: I think the spacing needs a bit of work 'typographer' for example seems tighter
    than the other words. Also the "GILL 1921" suggests this is a Gill quote (or a
    date associated with the dog shagging) rather than a date associated with Gill
    (Sans) the font.

  body: "I spent about 2 minutes on it as a joke but thanks for the crit. I did it
    in photoshop for speed and it was certainly not a considered piece of design or
    typography. The date 1921 was just a random date that I knew he was alive, could
    be construed as a quote I guess.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll develop it into a proper poster
    and do in letterpress."

  body: "\r\nFair enough. Reminds me of when Andy Crewdson decided to print some shirts
    featuring a Gill quote. Lines & Splines readers were invited to vote for a quote
    and of course one about the dog got the most votes. At which point Andy stated
    that he wasn't going to print that quote. \r\n\r\nIn hindsight maybe that was
    a turning point for him, moving away from the font world? I guess we'll never
    know.   \r\n"

    ornate of some sort.

  body: AGL do you do letterpress work? If so, it would be cool make a proper piece
    from these, even just for fun. I'm happy to work with you on this if you're interested

    have a recording of the song from the 1920s, a London show with it sung by a French
