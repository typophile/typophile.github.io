body: "So my friend just had her first baby boy, and I've decided rather than buying
  her clothes, appliances or something otherwise generic I'd design an A3 framed poster
  for his wall. As it stands I'm happy with the final design, but I'm always willing
  to hear constructive criticism of my work. \r\n\r\nIf you would be so kind as to
  evaluate my piece and make any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://img530.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture1jf9.png\"

  body: a little less air, perhaps, between to J and the a, and a little more air
    between the a, c and o; otherwise, rather charming...
