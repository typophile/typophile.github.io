  body: "The F looks like Clarendon Condensed that has been distorted (including partial
    amputation of the middle arm serif); the C looks like a script letter, probably
    hand-drawn, but somewhat similar to the bold weight of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/freestyle-script/|Freestyle
    Script]].\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
