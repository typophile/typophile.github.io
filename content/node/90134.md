body: "Some weeks ago URW++ published a typeface called Revis by Coen Hofmann. On
  the website it states: \"Revis is a formal script based on Daphne, a typeface that
  was originally designed by German type designer Georg Salden. Coen Hofmann re-designed,
  completed and digitally re-mastered the font.\"\r\n\r\nDaphne was designed in 1970.
  For 12 years Bethold had the rights to use it on Staromat, a phototypesetting machine.
  Salden never published a digital version of his typeface Daphne (although he digitized
  it and still plans to publish it). Now, Georg Salden is still very alive and he
  still works active on existing and new typefaces. Hofmann never asked for permission
  to \"redesign\" the Daphne typeface, nor he has any rights on the design.\r\n\r\nSo
  what do you think about this? I find it quite rude to copy a typeface of a still
  active type designer, do some changes and label it \"revival\". \r\n \r\n\r\nhttp://www.urw.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/source/schnellsuche_e.htd?searchchar=revis&submit.x=0&submit.y=0&submit=go\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/revis/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Revis-Daphne_4651.gif]"

    \r\nTo my mind, the degree of departure from the model may be about the same,
    but this case bothers me more because of the particularity of the letterforms.
    I can imagine somebody coming up with Metro when charged to make a monoline geometric
    sans even without taking a look at Futura, but nobody would ever come up with
    Revis without looking directly at Daphne.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>several letterforms

    into\r\naccount is better than being a crazed Japanese soldier in a tree.\r\nFor
    example if Salden had little intention of re-releasing his\r\ndesigns in a currently
    usable format and simply enjoyed\r\nsquatting on them, I wouldn't at all mind
    seeing somebody\r\nelse reintegrate them into culture. I believe everything anybody\r\nmakes
    belongs to Mankind at least a little bit (and sometimes\r\nquite a bit) and there's
    more to it than simply making money.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
