  \r\n\r\nNeacademia by <strong>Sergei Egorov</strong> is a Latin and Cyrillic type
  family inspired by the types cut by 15th century Italian punchcutter Francesco Griffo
  da Bologna for the famous Venetian printer and publisher Aldus Pius Manutius. Text-size
  romans are modeled after Griffo's Roman #3 (Colonna) and #4 (Leoniceno). Text italics
  are modeled after Italic #1 (Virgil) and later design for Soncino (Petrarch).\r\n
  \r\nThe family is designed for lengthy texts of an appropriate nature such as classical
  literature and art. Different versions of the typeface are optimised for specific
  point sizes as was traditional in metal type. Whilst the display sizes maintain
  a visual link to its calligraphic roots, text sizes exhibit more typographic qualities,
  following the moves of the carver\u2019s, not the calligrapher\u2019s, hand.\r\n
  \r\nRecent history of digital type left us surrounded by regularity and perfection
  in text fonts\u2014a trend that will only intensify with a switch to digital media.
  Contemporary luddites with their love for letterpress and hand-made materials are
  running out of suitable fonts. For that reason, the typeface was designed with specific
  allowances for letterpress photopolymer printing. When printed digitally, it can
  tolerate and even benefit from low resolution, rough paper, and low-grade presswork.
  Neacademia also has a more traditional approach to kerning and caps spacing. Instead
  of a multitude of kerning pairs, it makes use of alternative contextual letterforms
  to improve letter spacing. In many ways, it feels like using metal type again!\r\n\r\nThis
  carefully crafted family already proved its qualities in the <strong>Modern Cyrillic
  2009</strong> competition where it was awarded in a the \u2018type system\u2019category.
  Rosetta will introduce the rest of the optical sizes in the course of the following
  year.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Neacademia_slide_w_5986.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Neacademia_slide_2_4628.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Neacademia_slide_3_3600.png]"
