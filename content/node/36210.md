  body: Could be, Geoff, but there are at least two typefaces out there that have
    a similar concept. One is Raphael Boguslav's <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Avia"><strong>Avia</strong></a>.
    The other is a typeface that the design studio <a href="http://www.saturday-london.com/"><strong>Saturday</strong></a>
    developed from a logo that <a href="http://www.moderntypography.com/"><strong>Paul
    Barnes</strong></a> did for ChenPascual.

  body: Hmm, maybe. I made the quick judgement as I haven't seen any other Didot with
    such fine hairline strokes.

  body: Well, the two faces I mentioned are not Didots... the Rs are different, for
    one thing. (The ChenPascual face is in a recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Typographic-Design-Roger-Fawcett-Tang/dp/0300117752/ref=sr_1_73/002-8533603-2084863?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187360935&sr=1-73"><strong><em>New
    Typographic Design</em></strong></a>.) But after I posted the previous comment
    I remembered a third custom face that looks like these. I saw it in a design magazine
    -- possibly in Grafik, or maybe in Step Inside Design... I'm not at home right
    now, so I can't check.
