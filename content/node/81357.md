  All pictures, avatars included, disappeared. I quit, restarted, no dice. I run:\r\n\r\nOS
  X 10.6.7 & Firefox 3.6.16\r\n\r\nA strange thing I also noticed was that the bullets
  next to My account, My blog &c changed from a triangle and empty circles to a solid
  square and empty squares.\r\n\r\nI cleared all the history, cookies &c and the problem
  seemed to fix itself. The fire is out, but in four years, that\u2019s one of the
  stranger things I have seen.\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen this before?"
