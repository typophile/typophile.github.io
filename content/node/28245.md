  I can view both fonts in the respective font management programs however none of
  the fonts are available in my Adobe programs. \r\n\r\nHas anyone run into this problem
  or situation? Ive got a font suitecase of FF Scala bitmapped fonts and there are
  also postscript type 1 outline font?\r\n\r\nNot sure any ideas folks?\r\n\r\nThis
  is one of my favourite faces Id love to work this out.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

  body: From where did you license the fonts? A quick call or email to the supplier
    should sort it out.

  body: Meaning when did I get it? Tell you the truth I'm not sure, maybe in the last
    4 years or something?

  body: "I've never had problems with Scala and don't use either Fontbook or Suitcase
    (I use Font Reserve under Windows). However, I've had all sorts of mysterious
    problems with fonts that either cannot be deactivated or are supposedly activated
    but when you select it in an application, what you get is actually Arial or something.
    Never thought to ask the supplier for help, but here's what works for me:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Copy
    the font files to a safe place.</li>\r\n<li>Delete the offending font files (or
    shortcuts to the actual files) from c:\\windows\\fonts.</li>\r\n<li>Re-start Font
    Reserve, add the now missing fonts again to the font database.</li>\r\n<li>Activate
    the newly-added fonts.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nHave no idea if this will work on
    a Mac, but it's worth a try."

  body: "The old version of InDesign only let fonts with Adobe Standard Encoding appear
    in the font menu. You should not have this problem with InDesign CS2.\r\n\r\nI
    have had a lot of trouble with FontBook. FontExplorer is ok, but Suitcase Fusion
    seems to work the best of the current font manager. You should also be running
    Font Cache Expunger (it's free, but I don't know where to get it)."
