body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm reading the book 'What is Typography?' from David
  Jury, Rotovision.\r\nIt says on page 52: 'The sans-serif face was slightly more
  legible for the adult readers, but no measurable differences between the faces were
  observed with the children.'\r\nAnd then comes the author's comment: '[The sans
  serif used was Gill Sans, the serifed face was Jenson. The slight preference recorded
  by adults for the serifed face could be explained simply by the fact that most of
  their reading will have been of serifed faces.]'\r\n\r\nSince I'm not a native English
  speaker, I'm a bit confused, for me there seems to be a contradiction between the
  two sentences. The first says the sans-serif is more legible, but the second sentence
  says the serif face was it preferred by adults. Or does the author means that 'if
  the serif face would have been preferred, that could be explained by the fact...,
  although the serif face was not preferred'?\r\n\r\nIs it a contradiction or am I
  missing something due to my English? If it's a contradiction, which statement is
  right in your opinion? As far as I know serif faces are a tiny bit more legible.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\ntebalazs\r\n"

    the quoted first sentence stating that the sans-serif was a bit more legible for
    the adults was one of the (less important) conclusions of an 1969 research on
    typography for vision impaired people. I'm sorry for not saying this earlier.\r\n\r\nThe

    not a typographer and I don't know as much about type as you do, but I believe

  body: "\"I hope there is agreement in the basic questions already,\"\r\n\r\nActually
    some typophiles are much more interested in the mechanism of reading in general,
    others more interested in learning about preference, or specifics about type design
    that influence readability. If you go outside our bubble, you find others whose
    interest starts from their work with the vision-impaired, or even from government-mandated
    standards that resulted from some of this dubious research. So I wouldn't call
    it agreement, so much, but it has certainly been stated repeatedly that research
    methods and materials need much more careful and informed design, before meaningful
    data on any of these areas can be had. \r\n\r\nSince this dialog is heating up,
    and previously disconnected points of view are interacting, there's an improving
    outlook for meaningful testing, so we are making slow progress."
