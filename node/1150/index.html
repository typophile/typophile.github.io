  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">well, it says &quot;anything goes&quot; and since people do seem to enjoy one or the other non-quite-type-related-thread on this board, i was wondering, what liquid goes best with designing typefaces. it's a personal choice, of course, which might make this thread as interesting as &quot;What's your desk, studio etc look like?&quot;. at least i hope so. <BR>for me it's basically fresh ground italian coffee (Saquella) and natural french mineral water (Vittel) during the day. but if i'm still in front of the screen after the sun has left the building, i tend to grab something &quot;more enlightening&quot;. in my case that would be either beer from eastern europe (Budweiser or Pilsner Urquell) or red wine from spain or preferably from northern italy, depending on the weather and mood. btw, i'm german and live and work in hamburg, so my poison is not as sophisticated as it might look to people on &quot;the other side of the pond&quot;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Years ago, at my first ATypI conference, Dave Farey explained to me the correlation between the italic slant angle and the number of glasses of wine consumed by the designer. <BR> <BR>During the day, I usually have a glass of water handy (next to the bag of double salt licorice &ndash; they sort of cancel each other out in the system), but in the evening a glass of wine is not uncommon (usually a shiraz or shiraz blend, usually Australian), and if I'm still working at a later hour I have a scotch (usually Lagavulin, always single malt, never less than 12 years old - because some snobbery is good snobbery). I tend not to drink coffee while I'm actually working: if I need to stay up all night to meet a deadline, I find chocolate covered espresso beans to be more effective. But coffee is <i>very</i> important in other ways, so once or twice a day I leave my desk and walk to <a href="http://www.caffeartigiano.com/">this place</a>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">During the day, at the office: copious amounts of Hinckley Springs water and equal amounts of some wretched institutional coffee or other.  <BR> <BR>At night, at home (or with the laptop out and about) it's generally booze, punctuated by periodic intakes of water. Scotch rocks is the perennial favorite. Arbeg, Laphroaig, or Lagavulin (in order of preference) are the favorites. Usually it ends up being something like Dewar's or Ballantine's however. Unlike the esteemed Mr. Hudson, I prefer the 10 year Laphroaig to the 15. <BR> <BR>Beer comes in a close second. Old Style (the mainstay of Chicago) tops the list. Singha takes silver, with anything Polish (Tyskie, Dojlidy, Okocim) going home with bronze. <BR> <BR>And since I hear it's better for the ticker, I'll throw an odd bottle of wine in here and there. Typically Chileans (Gato Negro or Concha y Toro). I finally gave up my grad school obsession with 3-liter screw-top jugs of Livingston Cellars ;-)</div>

I was on my Amiga 500 (running Fog 3.1 under MacOS emulation) in my little appartment in Barcelona, designing a geometric Armenian font (hey, I was young) deep into the night, when, under the influence of nothing but sleepiness, I started drifting in and out of sleep, but never stopping to push the beziers. Finally I had to stop, and barely managed to crawl into bed, but not before I hit Save and shut down. The next morning I went back to the font, and saw a really strange Jeh indeed&hellip; It was partly garbled, but somehow it still must've made sense, in some ethereal dimension. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

It really isn't a strong hallucinogen, as many people believe, unless you were to drink a lot of it (I had about two fingers, straight, and didn't see anything unusual except a man sitting next to me playing a ukelele, but he turned out to be real). The impressive thing about absinthe is the apparently perfect balance of the depressives in the alcohol with the stimulants in the wormwood. <BR> <BR>You can make your own laudanum very easily if you have the poppies. A lot of perfectly respectable people in Victorian England made their own. <BR> <BR>I should point out that I'm not a drug user, and never drink with the intention of getting drunk.

Mind you, conferences are one of the few times I'll indulge&ndash;gotta deal with the lack of sleep somehow! <BR> <BR>Outside of that environment, caffeine free diet Dr. Pepper is a favorite, when I can find it. Although I like Guinness straight up, I'm also partial to a 3:2 mix of Guinness and Henry Weinhard's vanilla cream soda. It's got to be really good stuff, mixing Guinness with cheap soda pop is truly awful. (Isn't that a great straight line for somebody?) <BR> <BR>I'm also fond of ginger beer. <BR> <BR>But to be honest, most of the time when doing design work, I just drink water. In general, I'm trying to be better to my poor over-abused 38-year-old body. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>
