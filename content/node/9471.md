body: I&#39;m doing some graphics that will be die cut vinyl and go on a friend&#39;s
  boat. It will include the name of the boat and we want the font to match type of
  the the <a href="http://www.jboats.com">J/Boats</a> logo &#40;see below&#41;. The
  font they use is probably a custom job. I could try to draw it myself, but I don&#39;t
  know if I can pull that off. I&#39;ve tried taking an existing font &#40;Chaparral
  Pro Semibold Italic&#41; and editing it in Illustrator, adding curves and rounded
  edges to make it match. But I&#39;m not entirely happy with the results. <BR> <BR>If
  any of you recognise it or can suggest an a font that would match let me know.  <BR>
  <BR>I would appreciate it. <BR> <BR>-thanks <BR> <BR>-brad <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66249.jpg"

    target="_blank">Souvenir sample</a> set at MyFonts. J WORLD doesn&#39;t seem to
    use the same font.

  body: That&#39;s a match! Thanks so much!! I&#39;ve spent so much time looking for
    that font. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right about the J World being a different font,
    but the JBoats is the one I really needed to match. <BR> <BR>Thanks again!! <BR>

  body: A friend of mine was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0295955252/104-8577119-3791922?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance">a
    book</a> and complained to me that the font was pretty but terrible for reading
    long text. The entire thing was set in ITC Souvenir.
