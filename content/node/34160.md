body: We found a wonderful font to use on a book cover we're working on but had a
  hard time finding a place that sold it. I finally contacted the font's creator and
  he said that the font wasn't available for sale anymore. The book's designer suggested
  that the illustrator hand-draw the title based on the font with some changes. Does
  anyone know the legal issues surrounding this?

    might be able to find something very close.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The shapes of letterforms cannot be copyrighted. However, the delivery of
    letterforms CAN be. You can copyright a font's name, for example, like \"Helvetica\"
    or \"Univers.\" You can also copyright (legally protect) the digital data (the
    \"program\") that creates or delivers the font, so the digital \"font\" files
    you buy/use on a PC _ARE_ copyrighted (they are considered a computer program
    like any other, so they enjoy the same protection under the law a, say, Microsoft
    Office does).\r\n\r\nAs long as you are not \"copying\" the digital outlines of
    the letters (by using something like Fontographer), you are fine. Also, because
    fonts/type on computers are inherently accessable, there is generally no restriction
    on access/re-using the outlines in a drawing program or as part of a logo... not
    being able to use a font to create words would severely limit its usefullness.\r\n\r\nRestrictions
    on fonts are similar to the restrictions placed on most stock/clip art (the royalty-free
    art, that is): use it, modify it, print it, but DON'T re-sell it or re-distribute
    it in a form that other people can use in font form. For example, I can send you
    a PDF with an embedded Helvetica Neue, but there's no way for you to sue that
    face on some other document... it's part of what I created, and I paid for the
    font, but you don't have to (cuz you're just reading with it). I could even create
    a poster in Illustrator where I display every character in the font and convert
    it to outlines... you could open the file up and access the outlines all you want,
    but you are legally restricted from copying those outlines into a font-creation
    application and re-selling it as your own.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you're using an
    existing letter design as an \"inspiration\" or source for a new illustration...
    assuming you're ot copying vector outlines from the original font, and are, in
    facat, re-drawing letters in Illustrator, then you're fine.\r\n"

  body: It would be cool if more people drew their titles themselves. Designers rely
    way too much on fonts for titling in my opinion. This is especially true in the
    case of logotypes.

  body: You can't copyright a font's name (or anything else's) but you can register
    the name as a trademark. It's still a legal protection, but not the same thing.

    to do the lettering for your book cover. You already have contact with them.

  body: "Hmmm. This is very helpful--thanks guys. We have an illustrator for the project
    and she'd probably want to do the title art to go along with her illustrations,
    but it was a good idea to suggest hiring the original type designer Crossgrove.
    I'd never thought of that---might come in handy for other projects! The name of
    the font is 'Gararond.' Really cool looking font. Here's a sample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/06f2b1790c39924a609302b135bda1eb_5528.png]"
