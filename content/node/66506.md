  American Graffiti 2. Picture below:\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/picture_6651.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  M and R are a little off on the lower outside corners because the image was taken
  from a shirt. I tried to straighten it as much as I could. The main feature of the
  font is the serifs pointing left at top and right at bottom of the font. Any help
  would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAaron"

    With not much editing you could probably make something rather close.\r\n\r\n-

    to match the font I'm looking for. That being said, my need for help still stands.
    Just for note, the serifs are sharp and pointed on the font I'm trying to identify.
    Sorry for the quality of the example.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAaron"

    italic. It has the E and L serifs, but you'd need to move the serif outline points
    around to get close to your sample. Modifying the middle E serif should be easy
    enough, if you can massage the M into shape.\r\n\r\nOne last idea was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/flamenco/|Flamenco]].
    It's sort of close in feeling, if not all the details.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
