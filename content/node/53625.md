body: This is a book cover that interests me. I really like its simplicity because
  it gets the point across without being elaborate. I do not know what the font is
  but I think it works well with the imagery because it looks hand drawn like the
  image, especially the "s", it look organic. I think for children's books typography
  should be simple and organic. The simplicity of the typography matches the simple
  look of the drawing. I absolutely love the illustration on the front of the book.
  I like the sketched unfinished aspect to it. Plus it looks exactly like what the
  title says. This book is my favorite book of collected poems for children. Every
  poem has an illustration that matches it and the cover is a foretelling of that.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/516568A0M6L_4763._SS500_.jpg]
