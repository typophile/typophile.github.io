  body: "Don't know any script that could match this one so my guess would be handdrawn
    or heavy customization.\r\nHere is a list of fonts I like for this one, some need
    hard work to customize, mainly starting with \"vrlast\", cleaning and reworking
    some outlines and connections and recreating /E and /e (may be from /& or /3):
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/lakeside/|Lakeside]] (some more [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Filmotype/|Filmotype]]
    have also the right /E), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/freestyle-script-sh/|Freestyle
    Script]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/edy-type/bambola/|Bambola]] (using some
    alternates), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/fancier-script/|Fancier
    Script]], [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=lavanderia|Lavanderia]], [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=wisdom%20script|Wisdom
    Script]] (be careful with this one as it is really overused and distinctive so
    may be more work to make it less recognizable), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/ht-trattoria/|Trattoria]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/ht-gelateria/|Gelateria]] (as many [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Flat-it/|Flat-it]]
    scripts, some even have the right /E and /e), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jawfonts/fenway-park-jf/|Fenway
    Park]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterbox/terital-united/|Terital United]]"
