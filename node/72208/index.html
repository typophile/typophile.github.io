I agree with James on this. It feels too stiff and formulaic to me. There are slight variations in the stroke widths, specifically on the horizontals, in the sign that aren't there in the digital interpretation. This then causes the letterforms to generally have much wider bowls and counters in the digitization as a result. I think a more careful observation of the idiosyncrasies of the sign would have yielded a more honest & human typeface, rather than one that appears to have been made with fontstruct.

I know you weren't necessarily trying to recreate the sign as a typeface, Tomi, and rather to simply use it as a springboard for your own exploration. But I think you could have explored a bit further, as James said, what it is "about the original sign that conveys the charm that convinced the designer to interpret it."

And I agree with both James and Penn; I did not capture those metallic, rusty forms, but just made a digital interpretation of the original. But then again, that was my intention. I was not looking for accurate reproduction of each individual glyphs.

Steelworks is a font, not a sign. To be true to the original, 'V' would look way too thin, and 'W' and 'M' would just look weird, and I had to interpolate lots of glyphs. So, some compromises had to be made.</div>

If I take a picture of a tree, then represent that tree in vector form, you'll have the same effect as here. There's bevelling, shadows, texture, and imperfect alignment in the photo, which can't be replicated by a vector font.</div>

I do; however, that doesn't really address anything in the two sentences I wrote. Vector fonts cannot replicate real objects: they only mimic. I'm sure if Tomi took his font and put it into Photoshop and edited it to make it rusted, textured, etc. it would look perfectly fine, but that would defeat the purpose of representing the font he's selling, wouldn't it?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's strange that your interpretation removes the qualities that attracted you to this lettering, Tomi.
Why not retain the charming proportions (e.g. the squareness of E) and something of the legibilty-challenging idiosyncrasies?
Wouldn't the design challenge be to resolve that issue, rather than avoid it?
Steelworks is a straightforward techno font, nothing wrong with that, but quite apart from whether or not it is stiff and a bit flat, and how useful the face may be, you have missed an opportunity to do something more informed by the source material and more interesting.</div>

If it is meant to stand alone and give the impression of this sign, then some idiosyncrasies are needed. Blatant errors should not be replicated and material textures ought not be represented in the type, but small bevels, rounds and curves should carry over.

Ah, I see... you were referring more to the proportions of some of the glyphs, as Nick also mentioned (I think).

<em>Perhaps it is difficult to plan which idiosyncrasies to include when an application for the design is unspecified. If Steelworks is needed for layouts that include images of the Henry Avenue Forge sign or similar signs, then the typeface is successful without idiosyncrasies.</em>

I should have said this before :). It's pretty much the point I was trying to reach. If I were to approach a project that needed the type to look like the original image, I would rather have the actual form of the type so that I could make the imperfections/idiosyncrasies myself, as opposed to having it pre-done inside of a font.

<em>Why not retain the charming proportions (e.g. the squareness of E) and something of the legibilty-challenging idiosyncrasies?</em>

This part, although, I do have to agree with. I prefer the original "E"/"F" forms over the current versions.</div>

Again, your guess is incorrect. Either way, this release isn't about drawn type, it's about a font (in vector format) release. I'm not even sure how you concluded from my opinions about type semiotics/relationships to real-world items that I "don't draw that much type," but whatever floats your boat.

<em>Acres knows not to whom he replies; road signs have not been replaced in Georgia.</em>

I'm only here for school. My home is in SC which does implement the acclaimed Clearview. :)

<em>I’m pretty sure that if Tomi had preserved the idiosyncrasies of the design someone would be giving him shit about not polishing his designs before he releases them.</em>

Haha, probably quite true. The grass is always greener.</div>
