body: "hi all\r\ni have been trying to start fontforge in Windows xp sp3; i initially
  tried the cygwin-fontforge package; it needs cygwin to be installed first;\r\n\r\ni
  tried cygwin-mingw (using xming.zip) shown in this page; i downloaded both 2011
  and 2012 versions and also xming.zip. After extracting and running the same i find
  it is starting; but with a hitch (see the image!) the selection window is present
  without any information!\r\n\r\nthe command window (cmd.exe) is peppered with \"Pango-CRITICAL
  **: pango-xft-render: assertion 'PANGO-XFT_IS-FONT (font) failed\"  messages.\r\n\r\nany
  solution for a non-linux non pango/python guy like me?\r\nregards\r\nrnkantan[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaptureWiz_5315.jpg]"

    page</a> has clear instructions for a non-techie and worked for me.
