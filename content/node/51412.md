    - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. The Sherlock Holmes series were great, but their use of type
    was a little anachronistic - I remember one episode where somebody's calling card
    was set in Benguiat Roman."

  body: "The Sherlock Holmes series were great - you gotta be kidding, Jeremy Brett
    was the personification of the ham actor. Basil Rathbone was much better, (albeit
    only slightly hammy, but he had the excuse of being from a different era).\r\n\r\nNick

  body: "I think Brett brought the over-the-top theatricality that was present in
    the original stories. Holmes was a drug-addled asshole - his smug and drawn-out
    explanations of how he solved the crime served no purpose but to expound his own
    genius to Watson (and thus the reader). I think Brett's performances perfectly
    captured this dickishness.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. Rathbone was also a superb
    Holmes, and his performances brought out other aspects of the complex Holmes character.
    Different strokes for different folks."
