body: "I recently imported futura into fontographer and simply deleted all the counters
  to create a font i call \"blockout\".  When using this \"blockout\" font in quark,
  i sometimes need to save an eps from said quark document.  this is where it gets
  messy.  it does save the quark page as an eps, but when i try to open the .eps in
  photoshop a window comes up stating: \r\n\r\nTHIS FILE USES A FONT WHICH IS UNAVAILABLE
  ON THIS MACHINE. RASTERIZE ANYWAY?....\r\n\r\nnow, when i type okay, the \"blockout\"
  font changes to a system default font. \r\n\r\nthe strange thing is that i can create
  text in new photoshop and illustrator documents using \"blockout\", because i installed
  it in both system 9 and system 10 folders.\r\n\r\ni know that i can change text
  to outlines in quark, but i'm constantly changing these quark documents and \r\nusing
  indesign is not an option.\r\n\r\ni hope i explained this clearly and someone out
  there has experienced this and could shed some light on this situation.\r\n\r\nthanks
  for your time,\r\n\r\nesman"

    to your own drive) font-ID conflicts can happen. One thing you can do is make
    sure the original is de-installed before you install your derivative; or you can
    fiddle with IDs...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
