  career as a fashion designer. For the logo I am trying to integrate two Gs which
  are her initials. Here are some of my initial explorations where I have played around
  with an upper case and lower case G. \r\nThe logo has to look sophisticated and
  feminine. Feedback please!\r\n\r\nVinu Chaitanya\r\nGraphic design student\r\nNational

  body: "Hi Vinu!\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that the first four ligatures look more like G
    and j, while the second two read \"GO\" for me. Although I must admit, I like
    your very first one on the left, and your very last one on the right anyway\u2026"

  body: "I agree that the first four look like a G and a J which is why I moved on
    to the other two. Currently I see the last one as having more potential than the
    others. Any suggestions to improve that one?\r\n "

  body: Why don't you try making the lower loop in the last two ligatures also like
    capital G, so that the result looks like a letter g made up of two connected Gs?

  body: 'Here''s an extremely hasty pencil sketch  of another solution: bring in the
    suggestion of three dimensions, thusly, with the crossbar extending in opposite
    directions. This reduces the letters to abstract shapes, gives a distant echo
    to the Coco Chanel logo, and integrates the two Gs in a way that is less forced
    and less "clever"; not to mention that it sort of resembles a bracelet or earring
    or some other fashionable ornamentation.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GG_5904.jpg]'
