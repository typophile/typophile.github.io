Also, has anyone had success with a barebones text editor for Windows? My current workflow looks like this: <BR>  -Word for text input <BR>  -apply styles to inline quotes, headings etc. and save as .rtf <BR>  -import into Indesign with analogous paragraph styles set up <BR> <BR>I would like to take Word out of the loop as it eats up a lot of ram and is often unstable.</div>

I quit using editors like notepad for text transfers to InDesign altogether because this little program is so extremely useful. Best thing is that you can collect all texts for a project at single pages each in one folder without having to save each single file separately. Of course you can export the pages or folders as well, if you prefer. Can&#39;t imagine ever living without ... <BR> <BR>At the moment it&#39;s in german, but there are icons, too, and actually you don&#39;t need the menu, because if you&#39;re accustomed to work with windows explorer, you&#39;ll understand scribble papers as well. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.scribblepapers.de.vu/" target="_blank">http://www.scribblepapers.de.vu/</a></div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Jon, <BR> <BR>I think there are considerable advantages to doing text editing in vim or emacs, especially when you&#39;re doing editing of structured text &#40;like XHTML, TeX, or programming languages&#41; because the editors can assist you in a variety of ways.  Syntax highlighting &#40;showing valid XHTML tags in a different color from text, etc.&#41; and auto-indentation can be a real lifesaver.  The code is easier to maintain if it&#39;s properly indented, and syntax highlighting makes it easy to see simple mistakes like failing to close a quote or tag. <BR> <BR>More general features of real text editors like vim or emacs include the ability to move inside your document quickly and easily, regular expression support &#40;which allows for really powerful search and replace&#41;, and the fact that you don&#39;t need to take your hands off the keyboard to move the mouse because the editing commands are all keystroke commands. <BR> <BR>But the sticky bit is what you ask &#34;just how easily are these programs learned?&#34;.  Well, they&#39;re not particularly easy.  emacs is probably simpler to learn because when you start up the program, it behaves much like pico -- you can type and words appear.  vi has multiple &#34;modes&#34; of operation and typing only produces words when you&#39;re in &#34;insert&#34; mode.  It&#39;s confusing at first.  The other confusing part about vi is that the movement keys are &#39;hjkl&#39; &#40;left, down, up, right&#41;, but because these are under your right hand, it makes moving about the file very fast. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure there are many quick introductions and tutorials on the Internet that will get you up to speed quickly &#40;vim has one built in as part of the help -- &#39;vimtutor&#39;&#41;, but it will take a bit of effort to get up to speed. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been using vi for around ten years, and I still discover new features and tools that I wasn&#39;t aware of.  Learning how to use all the power of a real text editor can take a long time! <BR> <BR>Chris Swingley, Fairbanks Alaska</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, <BR> <BR>Thanks for you comments and suggestions, I don&#39;t know just how much time I am willing to invest right now but I&#39;m a sucker for trying new things. <BR> <BR>As for structured text and highlighting both my usual text editors provide them quite nicely and I&#39;m good with keyboard commands therein. <BR> <BR>&#60;i&#62;I&#39;ve been using vi for around ten years, and I still discover new features and tools that I wasn&#39;t aware of. Learning how to use all the power of a real text editor can take a long time!&#60;/i&#62; <BR> <BR>Deep can be nice. <BR> <BR>Nick,  <BR> <BR>&#60;i&#62;The main reason I use Word is that it&#39;s the standard&#40;&#42;&#41;, and people are always sending me documents in it.&#60;/i&#62; <BR> <BR>Always the case. I always like to say, &#34;Thanks. Why don&#39;t you send stuff to me as an RTF or plain text next time. Here&#39;s how: [paste &#39;Save As...&#39; instructions here].  <BR> <BR>&#60;i&#62;If I stop using it, I will forget how it works, or become accustomed to something alse, and then when I do have to use it, the air will turn blue.&#60;/i&#62; <BR> <BR>Yes I know this only too well, but for me I can live with the pain. It&#39;s in one of those poorly placed mislabelled menus someplace... <BR> <BR>&#40;&#42;&#41;What I have been noticing is this: <BR> <BR>Many people don&#39;t know that alternatives exist or even that documents can be created with tools other than Word. <BR> <BR>And further, if you do decide to take a minority position &#40;for whatver reason, sound or not&#41;, the problem is mind share and perception. <BR> <BR>The perception is that if my word processor opens the file but it displays differently from the Word doc, my word processor is at fault. If my word processor document is opened in Word and it looks different from its original, it must me my word processor that is broken. It&#39;s the prevailing illusion that Word is the program, not by which others should be judged, but to which others should conform. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s too bad because what could be promising alternatives like OpenOffice.org suffer horribly by trying to act and interact like Word and its Office siblings. There is a huge opportunity to do things a little &#40;or much&#41; more differently and make things better than Word. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>
