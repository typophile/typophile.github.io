  Symbol (the little 'e')? (I'm aware it's easy to get on the PC but I'm only on Mac)
  and I can get it on my Mac OSX system i.e. in TextEdit, but the symbol won't appear
  in Illustrator or Quark; ideally I need to get the symbol as outline in a vector
  EPS format.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where I can get one from? I've Googled it and
  it's not proved helpful... I'm tearing out my hair on this one!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSi"

    to say it didn't work (Quark). Then I thought, let's see about Illustrator and
    it's sorted. Nice work fella!\r\n\r\nThanks Nick and Sim - the link was helpful,
    btw!\r\n\r\nCheers - problem solved!\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: Si, it was destined not to work in QuarkXPress because QuarkXPress only speaks
    8-bit. With any luck QuarkXPress version 7 - due for release a couple of months
    ago - will understand OpenType fonts in the way that Illustrator does.
