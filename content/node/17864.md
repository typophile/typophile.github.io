  maps from the 80s in various widths. Maybe a simple id.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cawus.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: It's a version of Romana. It doesn't quite match the samples <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=romana">here</a>
    because there were a number of different versions. I would guess that the one
    in your sample was a film font version from the seventies.
