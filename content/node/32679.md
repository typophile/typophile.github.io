  body: "Hello Rajeshksethi,\r\n\r\nIf you are still struggling with this problem,
    you should take a look at the following blog\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/49832\">http://typophile.com/node/49832</a>\r\n\r\nI
    have been using IndicPlus to help me out with Indic Scripts in InDesign. If you
    are using CS2 or CS3 version of InDesign then this is your only option. If you
    are using CS4 then there are some other plugins as well and you could also use
    Java Scripts. To me, IndicPlus seems to be the best as it is fast and easy to
    use and also supports Numbering Styles in all Indian Languages. Above all the
    company developing this is Indian, so they understand and respond very well to
    my questions.\r\n\r\nLink to IndicPlus\r\n<a href=\"http://metadesignsolutions.com/IndicPlus.html\">http://metadesignsolutions.com/IndicPlus.html</a>\r\n\r\nHope
    this Helps\r\nMichael  \r\n\r\n"
