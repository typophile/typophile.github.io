  but do people generally post there and here? Seems the forum is the place to really
  post your diggs.\r\n\r\nI also can\u2019t seem to get the images to run in-line
  with the post. How does one do that? Is it simply a size requirement? It always
  just attaches as a link instead of a visual."

  body: "cool\u2026 thanks, but i cannot see how you did that. i only have \u201Cedit\u201D
    buttons on my posts. maybe if you put the embed in <code></code> tags. many of
    these programs use that as a way to post code without it being read as code."

  body: "Immediately below the comment text input box, you should see the \"Insert
    image\" link. That will bring up a file dialog from which you can locate the image
    file on your computer. It will upload it and insert the appropriate tags into
    your comment.\r\n\r\nThe \"attach file\" allows you to upload any file type, but
    that feature is only available to the originator of the thread (in the case of
    this one, that's you chopshop), and they all group in a list below the first post.
    you can add more files later with the \"edit\" link on the top of the thread."
