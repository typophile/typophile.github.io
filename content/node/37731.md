body: "Has anyone worked with [[http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=207|Malaga]]? I am
  considering using it as body copy and display type in a magazine design.\r\n\r\nAlso
  looking for a sans (needs to be very versatile) and another display face that would
  work well together. I was thinking of [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=ff+bau&site=d&btnG=Go|FF
  Bau]] for the sans (not totally sold on this yet, maybe Verlag?) and maybe [[http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/omnes.php|Omnes]]
  as a secondary display for upfront sections (although not really looking for a rounded
  sans, yet I LOVE this one).\r\n\r\nThe magazine is a lifestyle/consumer stand alone
  issue for condo/loft owners. I would like it to be hip, young, bold and graphic
  yet still very elegant and high-end... but friendly, approachable. Kinda like [[http://www.metropolismag.com/cda/|Metropolis]]
  meets [[http://www.marthastewart.com/blueprint|Blueprint]].\r\n\r\nWould love to
  hear some suggestions."

    Malaga. If you need a sans with a lot of similarities that can work in the same
    line of text \u2026\r\n\r\n \r\n"

  body: Thanks, I love Vista sans, I've used it in a few projects. I am looking for
    something with more contrast to Malaga (if I use it). Maybe [[http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/seravek/index.html|Seravek]]?

    system (as suggested from a friend).
