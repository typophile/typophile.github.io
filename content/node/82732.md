  is clearly amazing.\r\n\r\nAnyway: so far I'm thinking of using solely the \"Utopia\"
  typeface family, as it has a high x-height and nice \"caption\" weights that would
  make readable 10pt body text. It also has a good few display weights, including
  a Black Headline weight that could work well for... well, headlines.\r\n\r\n<img

    it's important to you to have your own identity. What do the other papers in your

  body: "Thanks all for taking the time to reply; putting typophiles right up there
    with open source software enthusiasts in my list of online cool crowds.\r\n\r\nUK
    newspapers tend to be either \"tabloids\" that print gossip and sleaze (use of
    heavy Arial weights and often a not-very-seriffy serif bodytext) or \"quality\"
    newspapers (more fancy Serifs, often Times, not just in bodytext but also in headlines).\r\n\r\nOne
    exception is the London \"Guardian\": the UK's (arguably) highest quality newspaper.
    They commissioned their own typeface a few years ago to go along with a redesign.
    http://www.christianschwartz.com/guardian.shtml\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/24/42450922_1844ebd575.jpg\">\r\n\r\nWe
    want a break from the past of our publication, which seems to have just used various
    weights of Times in the past: a \"quality newspaper\" imitation. However, we're
    not wanting to go down the crass Arial route. Utopia is an obvious solution to
    this, but I fear it would just look like us trying to emulate the London \"Guardian\".\r\n\r\nWe're
    a student publication that wants to be at the cutting edge, but we also want our
    content to be taken seriously. In a roundabout way, using standard newspaper fonts
    makes us look like imitators playing a game reserved for pros. Times New Roman
    looks as if we're just hoping for a job in the real world, so maybe something
    new could really set us apart...\r\n\r\nTo be more interesting, headlines could
    perhaps be:\r\n\r\n* Something thick with a hand-cut look like HermesFB Black.
    http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/sans/HermesFB/\r\n\r\n* Thin and modern (but a
    long way away from straight and clinical like Gill Sans) like NewJune http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/NewJune/\r\n\r\n*
    A thick italic display font, like ModernoFB Condensed Bold Italic. http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/serif/ModernoFB/\r\n\r\n*
    A really modern typewriteresque trendy magazine-type font like Vitesse Bold. http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100036\r\n\r\n*
    Even something really out there and fancy like Reina? http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/argentina-lian-types/reina/\r\n\r\nSo
    I guess I have two naive questions: \r\n\r\n1) do these seem like fairly legitimate
    options for newspapers headlines? and \r\n\r\n2) am I correct to be resigned to
    using something fairly standard (i.e. boring) and well-tested like Utopia for
    body text?"

  body: "What about Kepler? It's not as common as Utopia, but has great readability
    and the right look & feel. The only problem is the smallish x-height requires
    larger point sizes and will use more paper - but for a student newspaper that
    might not be a huge deal.\r\n\r\nOf the headline fonts above: NewJune and Reina
    are way too mannered; Moderno is too conservative; I like Vitesse, because it
    says both \"youthful\" and \"trustworthy\" to me, and it's a good match for Utopia
    (assuming you stay with that); the unicase feature in Hermes could be nice, since
    students like to have [more] fun!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hmm..Vitesse is an interesting choice for headlines, but I don't think it
    works for body copy the way you think it does.\r\n\r\nIt's really hard to offer
    specific suggestions \u2014 you have a certain feel that you're going for, but
    ultimately that will be conveyed more by how you use the typefaces than the typefaces
    themselves. What you're really looking for is a workhorse typeface that can be
    used in all sorts of contexts.\r\n\r\nI like Hrant's suggestion of Kepler, especially
    because of the absurd number of weights it comes in.\r\n\r\nI'll also put forth
    that the newspaper for which I was design director in college used Meta and Meta
    Serif, which was pretty great because they're not commonly used as newspaper typefaces,
    but the large x-height means that they reduce really well. The Headline weights
    of Meta, in particular, were useful. Now the New York Times is going to be using
    Meta and Meta Serif on their website, apparently, so I guess that it would bring
    kind of a \"webby\" feel to the paper, which I'm not sure is beneficial.\r\n\r\nWe
    (well, I wasn't part of the redesign team \u2014 it was the year before I rejoined
    the staff) also considered Chronicle and Whitney, which would have looked entirely
    different but would still have been a great choice.\r\n\r\nI guess none of this
    is really that helpful; there are many, many good choices out there, and the bad
    ones are easy enough to avoid. Good luck!"
