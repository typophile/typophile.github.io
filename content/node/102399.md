  project for this company and the only thing I've been provided with is some JPG
  images. I'm hoping to grab the font to help with a simple menu design/other projects.
  \r\n\r\nI'm not even sure how to find it. I've tried WhatTheFont with no luck, and
  hoping some one out there in the Typophile realm would recognize it or something
  close enough to pass. Thank you guys in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Avenue]]. So may be simply adding an outline stroke to artificially embolden it
    could do the job.
