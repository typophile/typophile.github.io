  (seemingly) good content gets erased. Often parts of threads don't make sense any
  more. \r\n\r\nOnly being able to edit your posts for, say, 30 minutes after hitting
  the publish button would allow for the quick formatting changes we sometimes need
  but preclude the above-mentioned annoyances, no? \r\n\r\nAgree? Disagree?"

    reboot\u201D.\r\nI agree. Mostly because, as you note, the lack of it allows some
    disruptive behaviour from people who, it seems, can\u2019t stand their own writing.\r\n\r\nAs
    an aside, I\u2019m tempted to correct that years old typo I can stumble upon in
    old threads, but with the current state of invisibility of said old threads, it
    looks even more irrelevant."

    post editing as of late. Not sure where all the drama is coming from. It's a bummer. "

  body: "I painfully agree. I deal in images - not words tho. \r\n\r\nIn fact even
    when I'm concentrating so hard drawing letters nice and fine like I'll misspell
    the simplest of words. So to write a whole post on a forum populated by a hungry
    flock of wordsmith hawks kinda makes me need unlimited editing privileges. \r\n\r\nBut
    yeah, we can't have just anyone come by and delete a thread's content like wheneva.\r\n\r\n\r\nn."
