  the curtain to find out what level of programming skill is required to build a working
  font editor. <BR> <BR>There is too much I rely on Fontographer and too steep of
  a transition curve for me to use Font Lab. So I figure it&#39;s worth looking into
  building my own. <BR> <BR>Since I&#39;m already a hard core FOG user, I can&#39;t
  help but want to base my origins on this application and improve it as I have always
  wanted to see it improved. <BR> <BR>However due to my own technical limitations,
  I have always assumed making a font editor is heavy business until I found out about
  RealBasic. I have only dabbled in this program a few times and I&#39;m not sure
  what it&#39;s capabilites are but I&#39;d be interested in finding out if it has
  the ability to cobble something like this together. <BR> <BR>Are there any programmer
  types on the list that have any insight? <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: I assume you&#39;re talking about building one for the Mac platform.  <BR>
    <BR>There is a great shareware font creation program called &#39;The Font Creator
    Program&#39; by a guy named Erwin Denissen from the Netherlands. His website is
    <a href="http://www.high-logic.com" target="_blank">http://www.high-logic.com</a>.
    This software is for pc&#39;s only right now and costs about fifty bucks.  <BR>
    <BR>I use it at work here because I only do very rudimentary font creation and
    this software is cheaper than fontographer. But it is quite hefty for shareware.
    As a matter of fact, as far as shareware goes it is one of the best in any category.   <BR>
    <BR>I would love to see it &#39;ported&#39; to OS X so I would have an inexpensive
    &#40;did someone say cheap&#41; alternative to stretch my puny typographic wings
    on. <BR> <BR>Anyways, I think he would be a great resource to start with even
    though it is a different platform. <BR> <BR>Tom

    further to see how to do some things with it. <BR> <BR>I did hear back from Erwin
    but he essentially linked me to the microsoft/typography site to read up on generating
    true type fonts. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: Thanks for the tips John! <BR> <BR>Last evening I opened up FOG in ResEdit
    on the mac and looked for ways to &#34;hack&#34; away at this baby but even after
    spending some time playing with the app, I was unable to do little more than change
    some dialog boxes and a few images. I thought I made big changes and then ran
    the app and no different or little different. <BR> <BR>I was hoping to get deep
    enough into the application to figure out how to alias all the cursors and just
    see how much I could do with it - Like soupin&#39; up my old bike. Let me know
    if you have found any good hacks for it. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, perhaps RealBasic
    isn&#39;t the best editor for this type of project, but with little serious programming
    experience other than HTML I truly wonder how difficult it really is to create
    an application that can do what FOG can. It&#39;s surprising how very basic it
    is and I would imagine some folks already have a good start on vector apps from
    RealBasic. <BR> <BR>The thing that frustates me is that it would seem there is
    a way to build applications but because I don&#39;t have the knowledge, I am severly
    stuck with what&#39;s our there vs. what I can create. It&#39;s alot like font
    creation but in a different industry. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, thanks for the insight,

    wanting to build a font editor with and unfortunately there has been no progress.
    Jim is one of the first folks I spoke with but hasn&#39;t revealed any plans of
    this nature. There has also been no progress trying to convince the Font Lab guys
    that they need to revise the interface of the application. <BR> <BR>Jay, I think
    you may be right and thank you for the nice analogy . . . I think my visitors
    would prefer I spend more time making new fonts than building a font editor. <BR>
    <BR>In the interim, I&#39;ve at least begun opening up FOG in ResEdit to see what
    sort of hacks I can impart to the application to affect the gui somewhat. If anybody
    has any nice hacks not already shown in the manual or the obvious starting screen
    hack/dialog boxes hack, I&#39;d love to get in there and change the icons, edit
    my toolbar, and &#34;alias&#34; the application to have a smooth look. <BR> <BR>Stuart

  body: 'It&#39;s not really possible to change the behavior of FOG using ResEdit,
    just the surface appearance &#40;and even that only in a limited way&#41;. ResEdit
    was created mainly as a way to separate the &#34;look&#34; of an application from
    the code to facilitate localization. The CODE resources that you can see in there
    are in a form that&#39;s not practical to modify--it&#39;s already compiled and
    linked. Making even the tiniest change in one of those could totally hose FOG.  <BR>
    <BR>My ideal font editing program: The basic interface would be like FOG&#39;s
    metrics window, but you would be able to edit the outline too. Having a separate
    window to edit each glyph has always seemed rather limiting to me, and that they&#39;re
    done this way because that&#39;s the way it&#39;s alway been done. Apple&#39;s
    old bitmap font editor &#40;FontEdit&#41; was an exception. It would be especially
    handy for scripts.'

  body: 'Mark, I work in roughly the manner you&#39;ve illustrated, using FontLab,
    by working with the preview panel open. I can set words using the glyph I&#39;m
    editing and see how my changes work in context. I can edit the side bearings in
    the outline editing window. If I decide that I need to edit another glyph in the
    sample word, a double click in the preview window makes it the current glyph in
    the frontmost editing window. <BR> <BR>WRT building a font editor from scratch
    - I&#39;ve spent enough time writing code to know a bit about estimating the possibility

    going to be a piece of cake, then it&#39;s going to take a very long time. <BR>B&#41;

    ever drew in Illustrator before. It&#39;s very imprecise. As for the kerning,
    FOG has a class based kerning system that is much better than FL. It&#39;s dead
    simple. FL class kerning is weird, over designed but ultimately very powerful.
    I&#39;m still in the process of converting my handy simple text files that I used
    to feed into FOG for kerning.

    design time is spent drawing, tuning and spacing. Sure kerning and hinting take
    some serious time, but wouldn&#39;t it be amazing to have a minimal and simple
    program similar to Mark&#39;s faked FOG image for just the basics. I don&#39;t
    mean Type Tool either. Just drawing tools and a window like Mark&#39;s for spacing.
    With smoothing, of course.

  body: The gist of that mockup is the idea that you should be able to see the effect
    of the glyph designs in context as you draw.  <BR> <BR>Imagine being able to drag
    parts of glyphs from one to another in a single window, for instance. It just
    seems like it would streamline the process. This is one of the reasons I like
    doing my glyph design work in Illustrator. I can see everything in context.  <BR>
    <BR>Aaron&#39;s suggestion of keeping two windows open is a good one, but I think
    it would be even better if the two could be consolodated. It reminds me of the
    early versions of Illustrator where you couldn&#39;t draw and preview at the same
    time in the same window, so you would have two windows open--one to draw in and
    one to see what it looked like.  <BR> <BR>I think this &#34;one glyph--one window&#34;
    idea is just something that&#39;s been around so long that it&#39;s never been
    questioned. Imagine if drawing programs worked like this. Each object would be
    stored in a library and could only be edited in its own window and could only
    be seen in context in a &#34;layout&#34; mode. It would be a real impediment.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not going to stop making fonts just because the tools could be
    better. The tools we have are light-years beyond what people used to create metal
    or photo type. But they could be better.

  body: I think too many of the folks involved in this discussion don&#39;t quite
    understand the number of person-hours required to develop good software. If your
    goal is to make fonts, I&#39;d focus on either that, or incremental improvements
    to existing tools &#40;FontLab or FontForge&#41;. If you want to get into the
    font editor business, then be prepared to spend a huge portion of your time for
    the next few years to do it. <BR> <BR>That being said, FontLab&#39;s drawing capabilities
    are fully exposed to Python. That means that you can do additional drawing tools
    yourself and add them to FontLab. They already added FOG-like tools to FL 4.6
    by doing this. If you don&#39;t like the way they did it, why not start by modifying
    their Python code? <BR> <BR>It would be easier to change the drawing UI of FontLab
    than to get Fontographer up to FontLab&#39;s level of capabilities, IMO. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>BTW, I totally agree with you about the impracticality of making a new
    font editor from scratch. Especially if all you want to do is make fonts. I gave
    up on that idea myself when FOG was released in 1985. :-&#41;  <BR> <BR>After
    finishing my most recent batch of fonts last Fall, I switched cold-turkey to FontLab
    and I&#39;m getting very used to it now. I really like the fact that they listen
    to customer suggestions and keep improving it. I have no doubt that it will just
    keep getting better &#40;and it&#39;s already very good&#41;. It just takes some
    getting used to after working with FOG for so many years.
