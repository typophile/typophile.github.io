  body: Almost as bad as the end-credits of the latest Mad Men episode being set in
    Arial.

  body: "The end credits of <em>all</em> episodes of Mad Men were always set in Arial
    (http://andrewhearst.com/blog/2008/08/mad_mens_arial_problem).\r\nPersonally I
    think it\u2019s a right choice (not Arial per se, but a contemporary face): the
    end credits tell us that the show is over, that we\u2019re no more in the sixties,
    where Don Draper is still Don Draper and not some actor named Jon Hamm."
