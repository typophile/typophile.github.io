  body: 'First impression: nice. Some problems with straight-to-curve transitions.
    Most noticeable on the D. Instead of a smooth round there is a bump around 1:00
    o''clock and 5 o''clock. The M, V and W look wide to me. You need numbers. '

  body: "the first colourful variation is problematic in terms of a normal TTF/PS/OTF
    font because it's not possible to have more than two colours (with font it's normally
    black/white)...\r\n\r\nThe variation of the font is nice but \"E\" and \"F\" are
    not distinct. Borh can be \"F\"s. \"I\" can be \"J\". Otherwise the variation
    is more liking and more original."

    Shades package</strong></a>, or also Adobe's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pepperwood/"><strong>Pepperwood</strong></a>
