  of Univers.  It is essentially a responce to the Lars Muller Hommage to Helvetica
  book with the aim of giving Univers its due as a true type great.\r\n\r\nI am making
  good progress but am sure that i am still only scratching the surface, if anyone
  has any good examples of its use (pictures or details) I would love to be made aware
  of them.\r\n\r\nWil"

    which is entirely set in Univers and shows how it can be used to good effect.
    In the PDF of <a href=\"http://www.marksimonson.com/article/179/frutiger-talk\">Mark
    Simonson\u2019s SOTA lecture on Adrian Frutiger</a> you\u2019ll find several samples
    of it, too."

    it was released.

    a houshold name with wider awareness of its artistic importance.\r\n\r\nThank
    you for your comments thus far everyone, they are realy helpful.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
    know if it was used in any public information works such as public transport signs?"

  body: 'A variation of Univers condensed, called Traffic, was used as a signage typeface
    for Muenchen Airport. The design for the signage scheme was done by Otl Aicher
    and Eberhard Stauss to coincide with the olympic games (I think). It''s been modernised
    by Wangler and Abele. '

    nations use Univers for everything that an American might use EDIT Helvetica for.\r\n\r\n<cite>unfortunately
    this was not sufficient to make it a houshold name with wider awareness of its
    artistic importance.</cite>\r\n\r\n[[Mike Parker]] of the Font Bureau, formerly
    of Linotype, would be a great person to contact, since he's apparently the person
    who made the decision in America to go with Helvetica over Univers for the Linotype.
    Or so he says :)\r\n\r\nThe fact that Helvetica was the cheaper typeface to license
    for the Linotype machine in America made the decision that effects us all today.
    Had Univers been cheaper, Parker would have decided to go with it because of its
    then obvious advantages of the number of styles. Helvetica at that point was only
    a few cuts compared to the family of 21 of Univers.\r\n"
