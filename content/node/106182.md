  body: Jost Hochuli's "Designing Books" is a great tool for book design, with lot
    of visual examples by the author himself and other designers. Highly recommended.
    Hochuli also wrote "Detail in Typography", more type/paragraph oriented, but very
    useful indeed for a seriuos approach to editorial design. Both published by Hyphen
    Press. And Jan Tschichold's classical "The Form of the Book", a more theoretical,
    but essential collection.
