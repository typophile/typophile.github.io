  body: Its very nice - I like the subdued colors and inventive use of space. How
    did you make it?  Can it be 'rotated' as a video or as an applet? You can play
    with that so the shapes become clearly ETA from a certain angle then scramble
    a bit (as here) from another angle. Bravo.

  body: "It's really nice although I must agree with hrant. I would probabaly not
    know that there are three letters in the picture if you didn't tell me. But overall,
    it's really great and when I look at it, I feel like it's about to move. :) You
    just need to clarify the letters and I think it would be absolutely perfect! :)\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nWanna
