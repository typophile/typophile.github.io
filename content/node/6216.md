body: I&#39;m working on a project for Artisan.  There primary typeface used in the
  logo is a slightly modified Trajan.  Im trying to come up with a san-serif face
  that would prove complimentary. This is for a website, so it would have to be somthing
  solid enough to holdup against anti-aliasing at smaller sizes. about 14-16 points
  will be the smallest sizes used.  if anyone has any thoughts they would be much
  welcomed. <BR> <BR>cheers. <BR> <BR> <BR>hildebrant. <BR>

  body: I&#39;ve heard rumor that Mr. Hermann Zapf is reviving Optima. I know that
    perhaps optima isn&#39;t something most of you would pick, but after visiting
    Rome, I have a new appreciation for the letters he designed. Both are classical
    in scale and inspiration. --- Just thoughts.
