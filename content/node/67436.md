body: "I am looking for a font \"Flammanion\" which is a URW font included with the
  Gerber Omega CP software. I don't use Gerber software. I called Gerber, they were
  no help besides telling me that the font was not available for purchase as a TTF.
  They can not even send me a jpg/pdf to let me know what it looks like. Has anybody
  heard of this font? Is it similar to another font? I basically need the following
  letters in a vector format:\r\n\r\nNAMASTE\r\nNamaste\r\n\r\nIt would probably be
  enough if I can see the font / these letters in an image file so I can match or
  rebuild. Any ideas anybody?"

    under a variety of names (presumably at some point they licensed the proper name
    from ITC and used 'Flammanion' prior to that).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: agisaak, Bendy, you guys were tremendous help! I can't explain the amount
    of headaches you have just cured, but I can say it lasted for about 5 hours and
    it involved about 20 people at over 7 companies. Thank you so much!!!
