  an 'art deco' inspired font. Has anyone got any ideas? Readability seems to be a
  problem with a lot of them.\r\n\r\nShrifteen is a favourite at the moment, but worried
  about readability. Any suggestions greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Display/30165/Shrifteen.aspx\r\n"

    Click here\r\nhttp://www.p22.com/P22_2004/Frames/browse.html\r\nthen click Art
    Style, then Arts & Crafts.\r\n\r\n(Or click Art Deco if that is indeed what you
    are looking for!)"
