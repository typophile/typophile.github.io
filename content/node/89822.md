body: "Type Directors Club has posted an announcement of [[http://www.tdc.org/archives/4147/]TDC
  Non-Latin Weekends], a series of professional seminars and workshops on non-Latin
  type design.\r\n\r\nThe first seminar in the series of four will address the problems
  related to the design of Cyrillic typefaces. It is scheduled to take place from
  Friday, March 2 to Sunday, March 4, 2012. Reservations for TDC Cyrillic Week-End
  are now open. Seating is limited.\r\n\r\nThe course will be taught by Maxim Zhukov.
  \r\n\r\nA similar series of seminars was offered by the TDC five years ago. Detailed
  information on TDC Cyrillic Week-End 2007 is available on the Type Directors Club\u2019s
  Web site. It was also discussed on [[http://typophile.com/node/31986 ]Typophile.com].
  \r\n\r\nMaxim Zhukov specializes in multilingual typography. From 1977 to 2003 he
  worked for the United Nations. For many years he has been intimately involved in
  typeface design, consulting for many individual designers and type foundries. Among
  them are Adobe, Agfa, Ascender, Bitstream, Carter & Cone, Font Bureau, International
  Typeface Corporation, Microsoft, Monotype, ParaType, Typoart. Maxim Zhukov is a
  member of many Russian, American and international professional societies and associations.
  He is a member of the Board of ATypI, and the member of the Board of the Type Directors
  Club.\r\n\r\nNote: I have adapted this text from the TDC web site and Atypi's web

    and fun.\r\nHowever, don\u2019t expect to cover your costs with sales in the emergent
    Cyrillic font market.\r\nIt\u2019s more about establishing professional growth
    and credibility than font sales."
