  the post:\r\n<<'Schrift- und Polytypen-Proben' (1848) {Fonts and examples of different
  type} --- appears to be a fairly comprehensive model-book or copy-book aimed at
  printers. It contains a wide variety of fonts and typographic elements, decorative
  borders, printer's ornaments, page cornices, emblems, shields, trophies and pendants,
  as well as what look like Victorian clip-art motifs.>>"
