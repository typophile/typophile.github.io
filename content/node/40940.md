  body: "Hi Joe\r\n\r\n\r\n1 and 2. I would define embellished type as type that has
    crossed the border into becoming a decoration, a blend of decoration and typography;
    where this cross is however would be up to the viewer or designers opinion.\r\n\r\n3.
    How these issues change over time is a good question. I don't know if they do.
    Looking back to type used as illuminated caps, it was though that the letters
    would be so complex to read that the poorer people who had difficulty reading,
    wouldn't be able to read them at all. For the people who could read well, they
    would be able to admire the craftsmanship put into the caps, to work as a hierarchical
    dominance.\r\n\r\nThis isn't necessarily the same now of course, and with works
    from typographic artworkers such as Si Scott, Tauba Auerbach and the likes it
    is produced to visually please the viewer. Si Scotts work in particular is very
    literal, the wording can be easily read; but Auerbachs work can have more complex
    meaning, personally not a pleasing to the eye though.\r\n\r\nAlso I suppose some
    of these newer styles of embellished type could be seen as difficult to read to
    some people, although not for the same reasons as to illuminated caps.\r\n\r\n4.
    A lot of design has gone organic as of late, and very decorative, but I don't
    know if this is a different trend. If you look at illuminated caps for example
    they have nature based images embedded. It might be interesting to find out why
    embellished type has a lot of organic growth? The work of Marian Bantjes work
    is not quite so organic, still very decorative though, and very attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Why
    are you asking these questions? We aren\u2019t writing your school paper are we?</em>\r\n\r\nShould
    this matter? This is a typographic forum where people come to find out information,
    and I think it is an interesting subject to talk about."
