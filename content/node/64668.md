  body: It should have come out on November 1st. What I've seen looks good but that
    has only been on the net. I'm also waiting for a few more opinions here because
    I've got so many books on the subject already.

  body: "Jackson, what's wrong with the contributors list? Not enough \"density\"
    of type designers? The only potentially negative thing I can read into the list
    is that there might simply be too many people, which sometimes translates into
    not enough content/depth per contributor. At 144 pages, it's looking like about
    one page per.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I\u2019ve skimmed it; I wish it had been around when I was in design school
    futzing my way through similar ideas and exercises on my own. It would be a good
    course book for a course in lettering or as supplementary material to a typography
    program. For someone who already knows lettering and type design it\u2019s just
    going to collect dust. It\u2019s certainly not the grail of type design theory
    some people want, but it\u2019s also not titled <em>Designing Type</em>\u2026\r\n\r\nI
    think Jackson was referring to the contributors list being absurd. Some of those
    people are dead, so it\u2019s rather a stretch to list them alongside those living
    designers who contributed directly to the book."

    done. The guys at Post Typography are always awesome.

  body: Just picked up a copy on the way home from dinner. For some reason I thought
    it would be bigger, like a coffee table book. But it's about the size of Ellen
    Lupton's book, "Thinking With Type", which makes sense since it's the same publisher.
    The format is similar. It's a good overview of the subject with a lot of recent
    examples of work from some of the top people in the fields of lettering and type
    design.

  body: "Just read it. As a primer, I think it's a pretty good book. What I especially
    like about it is that it has a pleasantly tool/purpose agnostic approach. Not
    that it does not introduce the underlying pen based structure of latin type through
    text and an exercise. But instead of just introducing the broad nipped pen and
    text type as the holy grail, it provides a lot of other (good) examples of how
    to approach the design and use of letters (not only type, but letters in general);
    lettering, display, script, etc.\r\nIf the intent of the book is to open up the
    field of type design to newcomers and to invite to creativity, I think it is doing
    it quite well. "

  body: "I recently received a copy of the book, and have been looking through it.
    First of all, my \"one page per contributor\" assumption was way off; the contributions
    are not integral/sequential, they're intertwined in the content of the book -
    which is not surprising, and actually a relief.\r\n\r\nThe book is quite nice.
    Small in size, but not at all skimpy. It leans a bit towards the display end of
    the type spectrum, but nonetheless contains decent technical discussions. I can
    see how it would be a great eye-opener for people wanting to get into type design,
    and I think it can work very well in supporting a type design course. It really
    has a little bit of [almost] everything, so it nicely reveals how large this iceberg
    is.\r\n\r\nBut since no review is complete without at least a gripe: the text
    size is a bit small; maybe 1/2 or 1 point larger (with less leading) would've
    been nicer.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
