  apartment building. I thought the typographic treatment was very unique, and I liked
  the way the letters flowed in and out of the surface.\r\n\r\nIf you've seen type
  used in interesting ways where you live, please share them here.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SNV31250_6019.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SNV31249_4185.JPG]"

  body: "Ngoc, this is fascinating. Thanks for sharing.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody want to
    ID the font?\r\n\r\n<em>If you\u2019ve seen type used in interesting ways where
    you live, please share them here.</em>\r\n\r\nNo, sorry. There isn't any of that
    here in Oz. Type used in interesting ways virtually does not exist in Australia.
    Certainly there is fack all of it in Melbourne and Sydney.\r\n\r\nI think it's
    worth me pointing this out. You could drop a bomb on every major city in Australia,
    and the damage bill for unique and interesting type treatments would come to $6.\r\n\r\nj
