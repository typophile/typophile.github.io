body: My friend is a contemporary artist and I am working on his identity. I am looking
  for a well designed and modern looking stencil font doesn't look contrived like
  many stencil fonts do. I've been looking, but I haven't come across the right one
  yet, do you guys have any suggestions?

    have to keep that font in mind, but their styles are not quite matches for this
    project. I''ll have to keep digging.'

  body: "There's a lot of great stencil typefaces out there, so you need to be more
    descriptive. \r\nYou say \"modern,\" but that has so many senses to it. \r\n\r\nEames
    Century Modern has a stencil, but that might not be the modern you mean:\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/eames\r\n\r\nContrived
    is also a bit vague. A stencil font is a contrivance. However, Dala Floda seems
    to avoid contrivance by making the thins so thin they disappear:\r\nhttp://commercialtype.com/typefaces/dala_floda
    \r\n\r\nAnd then there's all these stencils, which are very nice too:\r\nhttps://ourtype.com/#/all-fonts/\r\n(Search

  body: Tmac you're right, I was a bit vague. That was a little on purpose though,
    I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted and I was curious what the community would
    suggest. I think I found what I was looking for though. The remo stencil from
    Ourtype. Thanks for opening the door on that one
