  body: "Tidy up the connection of the two <strong>f</strong>s.\r\nThe overall effect
    is tasteful but understated, which is fine if that's how your client would describe
    the clothes they're selling. "

  body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback. Yes, you were right. The connection
    really needed some more work.\r\n\r\nHow do you like this version?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5220.png]"

    be a typesetting mistake. To achieve that, it needs more air and more flourish.
    I'd increase the leading and match the font sizes, then perhaps elongate/redraw
    the second f for a more custom, hand-drawn feel. \r\n\r\nIf you elongated both
    effs, it might alleviate the kerning problems of Af; if the top eff was longer,
    you could lower it a smidgen and then, nudge over the A.\r\n\r\nFew clothing companies
    use the word \"fashion\" in their name anymore because it evokes a London haberdashery
    or 50s dress shop....so, maybe a nod to vintage hand-painted signage would appeal
    to them?\r\n\r\n\r\nNo offense, but right now, it looks like a scary blood clot
    where the effs meet. The eye just hangs there, waiting for it to pop or something.
    \r\n\r\n(Well, that's not a pretty image, is it? ew. Sorry!)"

  body: This doesn't say fashion to me at all - who is the audience?

  body: The "ff" connection draws the eye but isn't particularly attractive or interesting.
    As someone else mentioned it would be helpful to know who the audience is.

  body: "OK, thanks for your harsh but honest opinions. It's exactly what I wanted
    (and probably needed).\r\n\r\nMy main occupation is web design, so I rarely venture
    out into logo design :-)\r\n\r\nThe target audience is essentially young parents
    looking for fancy clothes for their kids aged 0 to approximately 15.\r\n\r\nThe
    shop is legally based in Germany, but the plan is to sell clothes outside Germany
    as well, especially to Russia where the store owner is originally from.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to my client \"Afonja\" is some little fairy that all kids in Russia know. I think
    it's a good choice for a company name because it's short and easy to memorise.
    It was my client's wish to add \"fashion\" to the name so it becomes instantly
    clear what the company does. I would have dropped the \"fashion\" bit too, but
    I failed to convince my client here.\r\n\r\nMy drawing skills in Illustrator are
    extremely limited, so it's probably best if I don't do to much drawing there.
    Especially drawing curves causes me a headache. \r\n\r\nThe client wants a simple
    logo and has even approved my first version (which has actually never happened
    to me before). So I just want to improve it a little bit without changing the
    underlying idea too much.\r\n\r\nHow do you like this one:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-v2_4079.png]"

  body: "Perhaps avoid the <em>f</em> \u2019s linking all together if you say drawing
    isn\u2019t your strong point. Just set it on a single line in the same point size.
    If it\u2019s childrens clothes perhaps using something with a bit more charm would
    be more appropriate. You could also hint towards fashion by using something like
    [[http://www.linotype.com/88772/carousel-family.html|Carousel]] or [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100004|Didot]].
    And tie in the kid factor by using some pastelly colours. Just a few thoughts\u2026"

- body: "If it's for kids, I don't think the font choice is at all appropriate. I've
    seen some of your web design, and it's lovely, so I think with some work your
    attempt at logo development will turn out great. \r\n\r\nShop around at some kids
    stores for some guidance. If I were looking for a font to appeal to both kids
    and parents, I'd start over at the Sudtipos font foundry. I'm thinking something
    sophisticated yet playful like <a href=\"http://sudtipos.com/fonts/129\">Ricotta,</a>
    <a href=\"http://sudtipos.com/fonts/11\"> Pinguino</a> or perhaps <a href=\"http://sudtipos.com/fonts/117\">Aladin</a>
    both work better than what you have now -- which feels more like a men's suit
    than a child's overalls. "
