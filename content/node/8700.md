body: Hi! <BR>I asked a friend of mine, to ask a friend of his&#40;strange sentence&#41;
  for a font that he had used in a magazine. He said the name was Koloss, or something.
  I then searched the web, and found nothing. When I tried to searh for &#34;coloss&#34;
  with an &#34;c&#34; instead, i found a thread on this board where some guy wanted
  tips on cool slab-seriffes. And there it was! <BR> <BR>The hing is I forgott the
  exact name for the font&#40;actually, Im not really sure the name really is coloss,
  I just know it was something that I associated with the romans&#41;, and the dude
  who used the font is out of town. <BR> <BR>It is a big, really black slab-type.
  With, I think all straight edges, and sharp corners. No soft curves anywhere. A
  really pointy one. <BR> <BR>Really appreciate your help here, fellow-fontomaniacs!
