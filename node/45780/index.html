<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
I've been working on this logo concept for an estate agent company. I am very interested to get anyone's thoughts on it.
I could do with some fresh eyes really. I'm not sure about the type yet, whether it'll be all caps etc.

<div class=commentbody>I like how you've handled the wording, but the main logo seems lacking.
It looks half-way inbetween a blackletter 'r' and a house, and the ° symbol looks like a sun?
I think you either need to make it a house with a ° symbol, or else make it an 'R'.
The thought of that symbol though, a house or R with a ° is a wonderful and genius idea, take it right to the bank, that's the money-maker right there.
I wanna see more work on it and have it resolved better because it's not that often that a concept with that potential comes along.
EDIT: it's very ‘paul rand’ in it's simplicity and clarity of message</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry about that, i thought it was RGB, hopefully it should work now.
Innovati:
Thanks very much for your quick comments. It started as just the 'R' with ˚ symbol, but I wasn't sure if when used on its own whether it would be relevant to property.
I'm glad you think it has potential to work, I was starting to wonder if the message was clear enough

<div class=commentbody>I'd make it the same 'R' as you have in the logotype, whatever you choose that to be.
Right now if I just saw the house/R I wouldn't recognize it as either an 'r' or a house.
If you have a red R° I think people will see R....red degrees hot? oh, Redhot! of course!
I think once they know the name there's enough information in R° to convey that whole thought.
Just for fun though, had you at any point tried red° or Red°? I know it's close to that stupid retard(red) campaign, but I think it could work as a viable alternative to help you keep some options open - and who knows, maybe you can develop that too and see if that does allow you any freedom R°doesn't (although it might be more limited too, you never know)
I wanna see more!</div>
