body: Does anybody know what font they use for the credits at the bottom of movie
  posters? I tried Helvetica condensed and it&#39;s close... but there seems to be
  a particular font that is used on the majority of movie posters. <BR> <BR>For example,
  check out the movie poster for &#34;The Usual Suspects.&#34; The credits at the
  bottom are kinda small, but I think you will know what I&#34;m talking about &#40;thin
  sans-serif font&#41;. Thanks!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/13075.jpg"
