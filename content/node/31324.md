    type of content you'll be typesetting and the audience who shall read it.

  body: "I'll be designing and box-set of contemporary poetry books, each with a poetics
    essay also included. I've used this typeface specifically for my small press poetry
    books for a few years, but have never used a different font with it for titling,
    only the Collis small caps for titles. I like that, but thought that updating
    how I use it for this project specifically, which also has a website attached
    to it (hence my desire for a sans serif), would make sense.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's
    my rambling rationale behind my wanting sans serif titling font suggestions. Thanks
    for giving me something to check out, but other suggestions would be cool too.
    Cheers, Sopwith."

    a scientific readership (biology students and scientists). I'm using TEFF Collis
    and am looking for a matching sans serif. What is currently on my mind is:\r\n\r\nFF
    DIN (Alternate; with round i-dots),\r\nFF Fago,\r\nDTL Argo."

  body: "Thanks for your opinion! Can you argue a bit on it \u2013 is it more an overall
    impression, or are there specific details which are for these and against the
    other typefaces?\r\n\r\nWhat i'm not sure about is: Profile, if the x-height is
    matched to Collis, still has quite small capitial letters. And Kieviet comes with
    its own serif typeface, which \u2013 as could be argued \u2013 should be preferred
    to the foreign Collis.\r\n"

  body: "Certainly. I think the overal design of Profile matches well with Collis;
    the bowls and shoulders are quite a perfect match. Indeed the x-height is smaller,
    but depending on how you use the typeface that shouldn't matter. I could be wrong,
    but I think it only matters if you use both typefaces at the same point size,
    which would make Profile look optically smaller. If you're going to use Profile
    for titles it shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nStrada is a lot rounder which contrasts
    nicely with Collis. The details however are quite similar. It's probably not necessary,
    but I like how the typefaces contrast while the details of both faces are quite
    consistent with each other.\r\n\r\nKievit's details are a bit more different,
    but the proportions match quite well and both Collis and Kievit look modern.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Kievit's serif, I don't agree the best choice is always to take typefaces
    from the same super family. The reason for this is because the proportions and
    details don't necessarily need to match. I believe Hoefler & Frere-Jones put tips
    on their websites on the different options you have of pairing typefaces."

  body: "Indeed, Profile is in nice harmony with Collis from the point of view of
    shapes. The capital letters are, however, much smaller. In fact, they are the
    smallest of all suggested fonts: the following overview is sorted with respect
    to the difference of capital letter height (blue bar):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comparison_5737.png]\r\nand
    Argo (forgot that):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/argo_4018.png]\r\n\r\nProfile
    is therefore \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 not a good choice for me, since I also
    have paragraphs with an inline header.\r\n\r\nKievit, Argo, Zwo and Fago have
    acceptable height, DIN has perfect height. Since you like Kievit, what speeks
    against Argo, Zwo, Fago and DIN?"

  body: "DIN is way too technical. It just contrasts in a bad way I think.\r\n\r\nFago
    just seems too random of a choice. I just don't see the logic behind pairing these
    two. They're so different that using both in text application will probably make
    the details too obtrusive. As I said, it seems too random of a choice.\r\n\r\nArgo
    is actually a very acceptable typeface to pair with Collis. It's just that I personally
    preferred how the weight distribution in the other typefaces match Collis' somewhat.
    But, if you want a typeface which matches Collis pretty well in the general shape
    but contrasts in the weight distribution I think it's a good choice. Since you're
    using it for inline paragraphs it might actually be the better choice since the
    other typefaces might not contrast enough, but you would have to test that.\r\n\r\nZwo
    is actually the same story as Argo.\r\n\r\n"
