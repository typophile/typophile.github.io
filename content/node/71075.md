  body: Mike you nailed it. Do know of any clones/aliases? I know I've heard it by
    another name.

  body: "That's it - Formal Script 421 BT (from a really old Corel Draw 4 installation).
    Comparing them, Ondine is definitely cleaner.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

  body: "That BT means Bitstream, and as I understand it, Bitstream was allowed to
    rename and sell many of the early fonts that they digitized for other foundries
    (before other foundries had the tools, or know-how to do it themselves). URW had
    a similar agreement for fonts they digitized for other foundries with their Ikarus
    system.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
