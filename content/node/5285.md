body: There seems to be disagreement about the quality of the Monotype Dante font.
  Some say it is well digitized, some find the hot-metal version much superior. <BR>Experts!
  What is your final word on this subject and are there any alternatives to Dante
  that would look very similar to the hot-metal version?

  body: The Stamperia Valdonega in Verona, now run my Giovanni Mardersteig&#39;s son,
    Martino, has its own digital version of Dante. This is really splendid, has a
    range of optical sizes, and is much superior to the Monotype version. Also, it
    is based on the foundry metal original, not Monotype&#39;s hot metal version.
    It is not available for license. <BR> <BR>The Monotype digital version is not
    a bad font -- it is better than many digital incarnations of metal types and has
    a reasonably good weight -- but is pales in comparison to the Stamperia Valdonega
    version.

    <BR> <BR>John, do you know why the Italian digital cut is not  <BR>available for
    license? And are there samples anywhere <BR>online?

  body: Yikes! I&#39;ve never seen the Stamperia Valdonega version in a PDF before,
    only at text size in print. It&#39;s pretty scary when you zoom in on the outlines.
