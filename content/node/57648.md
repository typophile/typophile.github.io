  body: "Maybe it's just inkspread, but the two n's appear to have slightly different
    serifs. It almost looks like all the serifs were added, or modified by hand. Possibly
    the whole logo is hand-drawn, but the serifs seem rougher than the rest of the
    letterforms, making me think it is a hand-customization. If we ignore those serifs,
    what do we get? Aldus and Garamond don't have that 'a', but Palatino might still
    be in the running.\r\n\r\n[edit: though not if we look at the 'r' and the 'A']\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I think I know what this is. I think it's \"Quay\", designed by David Quay
    in 1985. the printed sample I have looks to have the identical serifs. The design
    is supposed to be based on Goudy's Forum Titling, with an added lower case. I
    think there are digital versions, but I have to look for them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks Mike Y. Goudy was suggested to me as well. I saw that it was close
    to Stempel Schneidler too, so I kind of started to use that as the base and tweek
    the serifs. If you happen to find Quay, please let me know. Thanks!

  body: "I cannot find a digital version (yet). Does anyone know of one? My notes
    said Font Company, URW and Scangraphic had versions once. \r\n\r\nThe scan below
    is the sample I use for my Serif Font ID Guide. It comes from Lawrence Wallis's

  body: "I found another print sample of \"Quay Roman\" in a 1994 book by Esposito
    & King called \"PostScript Typeface Library - Volume 1\". That book shows Font
    Company as the foundry, but that is long gone, as far as I know. I also found
    online sources showing Letraset as a source of Quay Roman, but this may have been
    in the days when they supplied transfer type.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: Ugh. Sounds like it is close to impossible to find then. Hmmm, maybe I should
    get that Encyclopedia you mentioned. Sounds like a great resource. Thanks again
    for all your help, looks like I'm redrawing this one...
