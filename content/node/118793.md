  body: It looks very close to <strong>[[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/circe/|Circe
    (Bold)]]</strong> from ParaType [2011] but you need to modify the /Q's tail

  body: Hard to say, very neutral, nothing really specific. Identity and logo by [[http://www.bedow.se/work/identity-minna-palmqvist|Bedow]],
    worth asking even if the answer could be "logo - custom - not-a-font". As alternative,
    I like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/circe|Circe]] (possibly the closest,
    not much to do part of tweaking /Q tail), [[http://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/euclid-flex|Euclid
    Flex]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/konstantynov/proba-pro|Proba]]

  body: Thank you. Yes, that was my struggle. Neutral and the Q. Thank you for the
    agency identification, Ryuk. You guys are awesome.
