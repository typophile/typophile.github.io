  after 56 PPM? Am I experiencing somekind of bug? ...or am I just out of delta?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I believe this is 'by design', i.e. not a bug per se. It isn't a limitation
    of the TT instruction set, but seems to be a limitation of FontLab's implementation.
    Hopefully Adam Twardoch will drop by and shed some light on this.

    Studio has some limitation of the top range at which deltas are applied. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"

  body: "Not in FontLab and not that will respect your FontLab-created hints.\r\n\r\nVTT
    provides much more advanced TT hinting capability, but you'll need to start hinting
    from scratch in VTT."

  body: "i wonder why you need a delta hint at 56ppem.\r\n\r\nas far as i know, delta
    hints are a 'last resort' when trying to gridfit a glyph. i have only used them
    for much lower ppem values (<13)."

    details that can't be corrected with \"normal\" hinting. Minor errors that I will
    probably only look at and see, or an expert who examins my typeface...\r\n\r\nI
    think I'll look into VTT hinting when I make my next typeface.\r\n\r\n\r\nRudy"
