  href=\"http://www.stockxpert.com/img/en/royaltyfree.gif\">Here you can see it in
  focus</a>. \r\n\r\ncan't find it on myfonts.com (whatthefont) oder linotype (fontidentifier).\r\n\r\ni
  think, i've seen it somewhere else before, so maybe you know the fontname.\r\n\r\nthanks
  a lot and best regards,\r\nmocca"

  body: "<strong>oh yes!</strong>\r\n\r\nthank you very much Manlio Napoli - could
    not find any differences between \"klampenborg\" and the font stockxpert-font.\r\n\r\ndid
    you find it by <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/identify.html\">\"Identify
    a font\"</a> on the same page? because i thought it would be the same like the
    linotype fontidentifier. maybe they scan different font databases.\r\n\r\nok,
    thank you guys, maybe i can help you out anytime.\r\n\r\n\r\nmocca"
