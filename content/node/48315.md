  details:  MAC OSX  10.4.11  Font Book 2.0.2\r\n\r\nAlso, looking to see where I
  can get a Full version of Font Book 2.0.2, as I do not have the install disk.\r\n\r\nHere
  are a couple pictures of what is happening:\r\n\r\nThis first is an Illustrator
  Error, the second is an end user agreement screen, and the third is what the pull
  down menu looks like in word.\r\n\r\nThanx for the help.\r\n"
