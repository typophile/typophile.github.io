  am having very little luck&#41;.  Does anyone know the font name and/or where to
  obtain it... hopefully for free?  Here is an example of the font: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.alghanim.com/Automotive/images/cadillac%20logo.jpg"
  target="_blank">http://www.alghanim.com/Automotive/images/cadillac%20logo.jpg</a>
  <BR> <BR>Thanks so much and have a beautiful day. <BR> <BR>Kevo'

  body: This is extremely unlikely to be based on a font. Automobile companies have
    lettering artists on staff just to do stuff like this &#40;the most famous being
    Richard Isbell&#41;. They don&#39;t just go out and buy a font when they design
    a logo for a $30,000 car. They want something special, something exclusive.  <BR>
    <BR>That said, it is possible that a Cadillac fan somewhere has created a free
    font modeled on this logo. Possible, but not likely, since scripts like this are
    one of the most difficult kind of fonts to do well.

  body: There is no shortage of script fonts that can give you a similar look though.
    You could tweak <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/english-157-bt/english157-bt/testdrive.html?s=Cadillac&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">English157</a>. Slant it a bit, cut off the loop on the C, reduce
    the ascenders. But I&#39;m sure there are others too.

    and work with it while continuing to poke around for other variations. <BR> <BR>Have
    a wonderful night and Happy June. <BR> <BR>Kevin
