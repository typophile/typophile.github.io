  be Clarice Black but I am not sure. \r\n\r\nCan anyone make me wiser? :)\r\n\r\nThx

    Clarice Black and probably a custom design. \r\nThe base letters may have been
    derived from a font like Radiant Black \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/radiant/fonts/\r\nor
    Castle Ultra\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?2MG\r\nusing overlapping Vs to
    make a W  with the center strokes meeting in a \"T\" to the left, and rounding
    the corners of the Ws and F to make  soft and \"friendly\" letters.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi damn1990,\r\nDefinitely not Clarice Black and Don's probably right about
    it being a custom logotype (registered \xAE), but pretty simple though - all straight
    lines and circles.\r\nThere is some info and a video about the WWF logo and it's
    development here:\r\nhttp://www.logodesignlove.com/world-wildlife-fund\r\n\r\nI
    also noticed your other request regarding other \"WWF lungs typo\" info, so I
    feel I should refer you to the info available from their website in respect of
    using site content. This is the legal bit, I guess!\r\nhttp://wwf.panda.org/using_site_content/\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps\r\nDoghouse"

  body: Can't say exactly why but looks like somebody played with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/peignot|Peignot]]
    and the more I look at it the more I think it's a manually rounded version of
    it (which to me looks very bad)...
