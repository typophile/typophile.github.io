  the \"Best of Boston\" Logo. Obviously the secondary typeface at the bottom is futura,

  body: 'seems that you are correct, I assumed that it was the same as the bold "Boston"
    in the "Awarded by Boston magazine" which is clearly not futura. but after a second
    look it''s pretty obvious that they are not the same face. thanks for clearing
    up my carelessness. '
