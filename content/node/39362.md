  body: This is one of my favorite victorian-era didone headliners. I don't know that
    it's been digitized. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/carousel/">Carousel</a>
    has some of these full ball terminals.

    have to redraw some of the characters I need, luckily I have some great reference
    to work from.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "I'm not saying one should do this, but <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/thorowgood-sb/regular-ita/\">Thorowgood
    Italic</a> could be a starting place from which to modify the thin legs to add
    the ball terminal swashes. (The actual Thorowgood swash letters are shown as alternates
    in the \"Homage to the Alphabet\" book from Phil's Photo, and they are not the
    same as your samples, but the letter contrast is close I think.)\r\n\r\n- Mike
