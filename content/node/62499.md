  handwriting was taught in Finnish schools at some point during the last 50 years
  or so...\r\n\r\nI'm not based in Finland so if anyone from there could help me out
  with where I could find this, I'd be very greatful...\r\n\r\nOr something looking
  similar too the rounded bottom one of these possibly? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Finnland13_3614.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!"
