body: "Working in Fontlab 5 for Windows I have a vlb file with over 2300 glyphs, some
  of which I want to copy for use in the bold version. I\u2019ve created a class for
  the sole purpose of selecting those glyphs and having a record of what was done
  for later debugging.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I select the class in the classes list
  and choose \u201CSelect Current Class\u201D from the drop-down the glyphs get selected
  but Fontlab also changes the status of the opened font file to UNSAVED and the asterisk
  appears in the font window title bar, indicating that something has changed in the
  font. Yikes!\r\n\r\nI thought the drop-down simply selected the glyphs in the class.
  Am I mistaken? Does that do something in addition?\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly
  appreciated as I'm down to the wire on getting this monster done.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nKen"

    the asterisk also appears, although you have not changed anything. If you weant
    to exclude, that anything was changed, generate the font two times (before and
    after the operation) decompile it with TTX and compare the decompiled files with
    a program like UltraCompare.\r\n\r\nThe asterisk also appears sometimes after
    you have generated a font. This is also irritating. It really should appear only,
    if anything was changed."
