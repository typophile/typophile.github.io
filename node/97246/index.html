It's a task which seems fairly easy, because of it's obvious constraints: one ‘just has to be systematical’. Choose your radii and draw a shape over different circle contours that resembles the character you're trying to draw somehow. But I think the easier a task, the more careful and precise you must be with details.

Something I find very difficult about it is, for example, the transitions from curved to straight lines. The sample Nick shows does this pretty well, but Struktur shows a few flaws.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmmm, I think I may have gone about asking this question wrong.  

The point was not what that face looks like or if anybody uses perfect circles or straight lines, what I was trying to ask is if any of you start out with a bunch of circles, some of the circles divided into halves and quadrants; and then once they have drawn those how they like, then drawing the outlines on top of them.

So in the example above, the designer would start with all the shapes that are dotted lines, and then only after he had arranged those shapes how he wanted, would he draw the outlines by connecting the shapes.

I know I've seen a bunch of diagrams like this in books about type design, the idea is hundreds of years old.</div>

It's true you could theoretically get along without Bèzier curves, using only arcs to approximate your curve (like one esentially does with Bézier curves). Not even ellipses are necessary. 

My point: from the practical point of view it makes no sense. Everything that restricts a designer technically in his creativity, everything that makes a class of shapes more likely than other, is mistaken as soon as it is presented as an ‘aesthetic method’. Just saying, more than often this idea is interpreted as a suggestion to a specific way of drawing. Like someone who looks at Romain de Roi's drawing and says: “So this is it! It was circles and ovals all this time! And I've been struggling with this weird Bèzier thingies for so long...”.</div>

This is absolutely true.

My unhappiness with the Bèzier curve is that some designers might want to specify traditional designs directly in terms of conic sections, at least in part.

One very early electronic typesetting system actually provided only one curve, an Archimedian spiral, in addition to the straight line. Ikarus, I believe.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The question was once famously asked, “How long is the coastline of Britain?”—the answer being that it depends on the amount of detail in the measurement method. (This was the primary consideration that led to the invention of fractals.)

A similar principle applies to type outlines; any glyph shape can be rendered with straight lines and look sufficiently smooth if the curves are divided into enough straight segments, and rendered at an appropriate resolution (Licko’s <em> Journal</em> springs to mind). The idea is that a complex line may be broken down into an appoximation by using shorter components of a less complex type. There are four or more levels of line complexity (according to the sophistication of one’s maths): straight, circular, oval, quadratic…

Certainly, if one restricts a type design to the simpler lines, there is the danger of banality.
It helps a designer working in a simple mode to be familiar with complex curves, because this facilitates a subtlety of expression (by hand and eye) which mitigates the potential for crudeness and banality; two examples—for instance, firstly, how much should be “shaved off” the transition point between straight and curved? (See my post of Oct. 16) And secondly, what is the relationship between the radius size of the curves used in /m, /n and /o? 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Karelia_mno_4641.png]
Thirdly, how big should the overshoot alignment zone be?
And so on.
There is arguably less leeway in determining these subtle parameters of a type design in types based on simple modular forms, than there is in more complex types.

Are you sure? I thought Benoit Mandelbrot invented it for kicks.

<blockquote>any glyph shape can be rendered with straight lines and look sufficiently smooth if the curves are divided into enough straight segments</blockquote>

Yes, enough to fool the eye and/or overshoot the output resolution. Some early font formats did that, and in fact in the end RIPs* still do this AFAIK.

		<div class="commentbody">I know that a book about fractals used the question "How long is the coastline of Britain" to introduce the idea to the reader.

Some fractals existed before Mandelbrot, such as the "dragon curve"; but Mandelbrot can be credited with the investigations that led to fractals being recognized under a unifying concept. This led to the conceptual framework that let mathematicians come up with such things as Hausdorff-Bescovitch dimension, for example.

Fractals are relevant to such things as painting trees and leaves; fonts tend not to need to be natural and wild. But mathematics did touch on some fonts - such as Piet Hein's superellipses giving rise to Melior.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant: <em>And we might have never had Baskerville (and then Bodoni, who was an admirer of Baskerville) without [the Romain du Roi].</em>

The Romain du Roi was commissioned in 1692, and not actually in use until 1702. By that date, John Ayres and George Shelley had already perfected the style of the English Roman on which Baskerville's types are based. The earliest expression of that style that I have so far found is John Seddon's of 1690, i.e. two years before the commissioning of the Romain du Roi. The line of Baskerville's development is so obviously in this English tradition, that I don't think any connection can be made between his types and the RdR.
______

And then there's this, which I came across in a recent Oak Knoll catalogue. This is the title page of a  prayer book written by Louis Senault and dedicated to Marie Anne Christine Victoire of Bavaria, who in 1680 married the French Dauphin.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prieres_3888.jpg]

The book is undated, but indications are that it was produced in the 1680s. That lowercase in 'Sainte Ecriture' shows clear indications of being written with a split nib, resulting in the pattern of stroke modulation and vertical stress that characterises the letters of the Romain du Roi (and which are not determined by the construction method of the RdR; as Durer, Tory and numerous others had long since demonstrated, geometric approaches can just as easily produce diagonal stress).

James Mosley, in his essay on 'Les caractères de l'imprimerie royale', has already drawn his attention to the influence of the written romans of Nicolas Jarry and Louis Senault on the design of the RdR, some of the former's dating from as early as 1668. I'd go so far as to say that Grandjean's actual RdR types owe more to Jarry and Senault than they do to the committee's constructivist experiments.

So in terms of the development of neo-classical typography of the mid-18th Century, I posit two lines of development:
French : Jarry/Senault -> Grandjean -> Fournier
England : Seddon -> Shelley -> everyone else* -> Baskerville

* By the 1730s, the 'English roman' shows up in the standard repertoire of every writing master whose work I have examined. No exceptions.

The interesting question, then, is whether these French and English developments were independent pursuit of the same goal -- development of a style of type-like lettering better suited to neo-classical layout and ornament than the actual types of the 17th and early 18th Centuries --, or if Seddon was aware of what was happening in France. I'm inclined to think that the developments were independent, at least in terms of the evidence of the actual writing that resulted. There are distinctive differences in the solutions for some letters that persist in the writing and types of the 18th Century that are identifiably French and English.</div>

More likely the other way around.
The squircle of Microgramma and Melior (both 1952) preceded Hein’s superellipse (1959?)
IMO the vogue for this shape derived from the CRT screen, where it was incidental.
Commercial TV programming started in 1948 in the USA.</div>

This is the most interesting point to me.  I myself (who does not have any of Nick's skill), probably would have placed that point further north along the curve, or possibly not have had a point there at all. you could stretch out the control arm of the point at the top of the curve, stretch it out to the right and probably get a smoother curve there. <em>Usually</em> less points = smoother curve.  Also, It's hard to tell from the shot, but it looks like Nick may have wanted to create a slight bulge between the point I'm talking about and the one just south of it.  Is that the case?  I'd love to hear Nick talk about that point a little.</div>

Not sure what that had to do with the topic, other  than the CRT, but ...

We got our first TV set, a 7 inch RCA, in 1947. By then there were three broadcasting networks, NBC, (WNBT), CBS, and ABC (WJZ-TV), each carrying one of the New York City baseball teams. Licensing for commercial TV started on July 1, 1941; the first US advertising was on WNBT as part of its test pattern (Bulova Watch Time) that same day. I first saw TV in 1940 at the 1939 NY Worlds fair, but not again until early 1947.

 The first set which my birth family had—circa 1948, just like me—was a console model in which the CRT faced up, and was viewed in a mirror attached to the lid of the console. My mother’s father—a professional scenic artist—managed to equip the box with a Fresnel lens, which projected the image onto a wall. The world’s first projection TV? Who knows?</div>

True enough, but a trivial distinction: a mass medium does not become a mass medium until it is accessible to the masses. As opposed to the ubiquity of print, television required the purchase of a receiver, in order to mesmerize with its Dancing Scan Lines—a different kind of cool, if you dig McLuhan. Today, it is pixels which do the dancing, constantly seducing us to part with our money to assert our precious individuality: Lord, what fools these mortals be.

From 1981 to 1984, I worked as an Art Director for KXAS-TV, the NBC affiliate in Fort Worth-Dallas. The station came on the air as WBAP (We Broadcast a Program) in 1948 as the first TV station west of the Mississippi, the love-child of Amon Carter, publisher of <em>The Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em>. A few years before I arrived, the station was purchased by Lin Broadcasting as a cash cow: the station routinely generated a 55% profit margin. BTW, Lin was one of the pioneers in developing cellular phone technology.

At the station, I had the privilege of working with professionals who had been there since the beginning—people like Dick Smith, who was Chief Engineer. I became a Grasshopper, and learned well at his feet. State-of-the-art technology at the time also occasioned my first foray into font-making—creating bitmap fonts for the station’ Chyron IV character generator.</div>

<em>"That’s post facto BS.  A veneer of promotional tech-porn.  Microgramma is squircular in form, i.e. (super-) elliptical, not circle-based."</em>
- Nick Shinn

The thing is though, that book, Alfa Beta, was actually written by the man who created Microgramma.  Could he be lying about it's construction, throwing out a red herring if you will, in an attempt to confuse and slow down his competition?  Sure, but it seems a bit much, considering no one was forcing him to write that book, and that writing that book probably took a good deal of his time, and that when it was published, Novarese might only have had a handful of real competitors.  I believe he really was explaining how he drew and constructed faces.</div>

Wow: were those guys blowing some serious smoke up your ass. The Chyron system operated with three eight-inch floppies, one of which contained the bitmaps, no “special chip” required.

At KXAS, I became the Resident Master of the Chyron because, one: I made it a point of being in attendance every time the Field Service technician showed up to fix a bug (which were numerous); and two, because I was able to determine at one point that what appeared to be a fatal system error was due to a failed data transfer switch on Drive A. In the latter instance, I told one of the engineers to meter the Drive A output. He was skeptical—until he did it, and proved that my diagnosis was correct. Thereafter, the Engineering Department called me before they called Field Service, anytime an operator encountered a problem. This process resulted in fewer service calls, which was—at least for me—somewhat of a bummer, because the field techs were always sharing new processes and procedures with me, especially the motion chaining one could achieve with macros.</div>

Not the one he had - I remember his had some weird font cartridge setup. Maybe the newer ones were more flexible (although programming the data on those disks couldn't have been trivial) but of course upgrading to that would have cost even more. I solved the problem with a $50 video encoder. Plus with the Amiga I also did 3D animation, crisp raytraced scenes, etc. for them.

<blockquote>Downer .... says it's a limited approach.</blockquote>

A while back I wrote a review of Vendetta. I liked a lot of things about it (only some of the spacing is wonky, like the right sidebearing of the "f"; plus the pronounced faceting really begs for optical masters, since the font ends up feeling very different depending on size) but one thing that I wish had been revealed was how Downer went beyond the limited construction method; if you know that a method is limited but you flaunt it anyway, it's good to explain how you overcame the limitations. Unless some more insight has been published since and I missed it.

<blockquote>the value of theory and practice used together</blockquote>

Hear, hear. There is no cultural progress without theory.

I suggest you put your belief to the test—take the capital O from Microgramma, and see if its curves are in any part circular, by trying to superimpose arcs of circle on its outline.

Or compare Microgramma with Alphaville, which <em>was</em> constructed with circles and straight lines:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OOs_5052.png]</div>

if you are drawing a typeface by hand a hundred or more years ago and you have some interest in being consistent and making all the letters look like they belong to the same font, well, you're gonna use a compass and a set of dividers and draw some plots to work how it all fits together.

(then, maybe after the fact, you're gonna make some nice drawings to show how clever you were)

No it can’t.
Can you not see the difference, or does it mean nothing to you?
If you’re prepared to go to all this trouble to make these images, you would have been better off to invest in the Microgramma font and inspect its paths closely.

I doubt that Microgramma can even be made with a superellipse.
It’s drawn, not plotted.
I suspect it was drawn ﬁrst with a pencil, and then ﬁnished either freehand with a brush and ink, or by a pen with French Curves. The thing about the French curves is that they are not used as a conceptual building block, but to ﬁrm up/cleanly render shapes that are freehand.
Perhaps letters such as O were made from a repeated (freehand) quadrant shape as template.
Interestingly, Adrian Frutiger made letter artwork from cutouts.
Dave Farey also used a knife (on peelable Rubylith “film” on acetate) to make the stencil artwork at Letraset, a technique he explained at a TypeCon a few years ago.</div>

I do own a copy of microgramma and did inspect its curves, and really the only differences I see between the shape I made and microgramma's O is that my shape has sharper (smaller) corners.  That's easy to fix, just make those four blue circles bigger.  Oh, and there are short straight lines at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock postions in microgramma.</div>
