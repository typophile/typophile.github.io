body: I only noticed this recently, but when I use the drawing tool and simply click
  without dragging, a point appears, but it has a yellow BCP dot! Is that normal?
  How do I make this a clean point?

  body: "Yes, AFAIK when drawing with the pen/drawing tool and simply clicking, the
    points end up with \u201Cin point BCPs\u201D (i.e. BCPs that have the same coordinates
    as the node). I learned this the hard way. :-\\  I\u2019m not sure if there is
    a way to use the pen tool and not get these so I\u2019ll listen in, too.\r\n\r\nAs
    for remedying it in existing points: If this is the same thing that I had, then
    alt-click-dragging \u2013 which would usually extend a BCP \u2013 will instead
    move the node and reveal the BCP below. You can do that, then delete the BCP,
    then move the node back to where it was. Alternately, upon right-clicking the
    node the context menu should have something like \u201Cretract BCPs\u201D."

  body: "I have used CorelDraw since version one, so the way it works makes perfect
    sense to me. Consequently, the way virtually every other drawing program works
    does NOT make sense to me.\r\n\r\nHowever, from my experience, I think it is universally
    true is: if a program is doing something which annoys or puzzles you\u2014simply
    DON\u2019T DO the thing that annoys you. If you can possibly help it.\r\n\r\nLike
    with CorelDraw 6, which was a total cl*sterf*ck, which worked pretty well until
    you hit \u201CSAVE,\u201D at which point, the program crashed and you lost ALL
    your work. On the bright side, you could EXPORT your work just fine, and re-import,
    no problem. So, no problem? Well, after you learned the workaround, no; otherwise,
    yes.\r\n\r\nBoy, SOME beta testers STILL deserve a swift kick for overlooking
    THIS minor annoyance\u2026"

    or something.\r\nAssuming FontLab knows what they're doing with this fundamental
    tool \u2014 does that mean it's alright to leave the on-point BCPs alone?"

  body: "No, best practice is to have no dead-BCP (as I call them) points. This is
    because automatic conversion (like to TT-style quadratic beziers) can get messed
    up (just like with a missing inflection point).\r\n\r\nIf you Alt-Shift-Click
    on a \"half-dead\" curve FL will bring the dead BCP to life and adjust the other
    end accordingly - although the resultant approximation to your original will rarely
    be close enough - you need to tweak it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    maybe thereby violating some EULAs :-). But only in landscape? Interesting.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    (hit '5' on your keyboard). I frequently build my outlines by only using the corner
    tool at first, placing points approximately at extrema, and then pulling curves
    by option-dragging the line segments."
