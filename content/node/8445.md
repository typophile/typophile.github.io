  body: 'Hanging punctuation first appeared in Gutenberg&#39;s 42-line Bible, which
    was the first western book to have real justified text. Hand-written manuscripts
    couldn&#39;t acheive true justification, so their hyphens would be part of the
    &#34;column,&#34; and not hanging out from it, I guess. <BR> <BR>There is a good
    description of this in John Man&#39;s book <i>Gutenberg: How One Man Remade the
    World With Words.</i>'

    <BR> <BR>Sometimes they hang, and sometimes they don&#39;t. Some manuscripts come
    remarkably close to even justification, for pages at a time, showing that the
    scribe was very experienced and had a good sense of how much he needed to stretch
    or expand letters and spacing in a line to fit his text. Of course, having the
    freedom to break a word wherever he felt like it made things easier: linguistically
    based hyphenation rules are a later development. And where did Gutenberg get the
    idea of hanging punctuation, something that it neither easy nor obvious to do
    in typesetting? From the manuscripts of course: justification was the ideal long
    before Gutenberg made it a mechanical reality.'

  body: '&#62;Hand-written manuscripts couldn&#39;t acheive true justification, <BR>
    <BR>They could have &#40;and did occasionally&#41;, but it would have taken the
    scribe much longer, as he would have had to &#34;sketch out&#34; each line before
    he started it, to give himself a rough template against which to pace himself,
    to ensure that the final word break came at the exact end -- rather than just
    continuing non-stop from line to line.  <BR> <BR>That was for a one-off. <BR>
    <BR>Because many copies were produced from a type original, it was worthwhile
    for Gutenburg, Schoffer, and crew to invest time in producing more precise justification.  <BR>
    <BR>But there is likely another cause. At some stage of the process, the new technologists
    would have reviewed their rag-right &#34;imitation of calligraphy&#34; and found
    it looked bogus, the ragged edge being at odds with the precision of the letterforms;
    a scribe who was slow, careful and neat with individual glyphs would have lavished
    similar attention on getting a nice smooth rag. <BR>Hence precise typographic
    justification originated as  aesthetic camouflage. <BR> <BR>However, the Gutenburg
    Bible&#39;s justification was still not &#34;true&#34; &#40;the right side of
    the column is not as &#34;straight&#34; as the left&#41;, and nonetheless resorts
    to a much greater amount of hyphenation than a scribe would have tolerated. Forgiveable,
    though -- justifying Latin at around 35 characters to the line is &#34;difficultas
    maximus&#34;.'

  body: Don&#39;t forget that scribes usually were copying an existing manuscript,
    and my hunch is they generally maintained the same linebreaks, which would mean
    they had great advance knowledge of how much a given line needed to be looser/tighter

    <BR>Manuscripts were copied on different size paper, in different script styles,
    were sometimes more elaborate than the originals and sometimes less elaborate.

  body: I suspect you are right about this Hrant. Mass copying was a great concern.
    Especially with the establishment of the University system. The impetus for the
    development of a form of mechanical writing came about as a call for a means to
    eliminate the corruption of text that copying was increasingly responsible for.
    My understanding is that the papal authority Nicholas of Cues made this proclamation
    &#40;in writing&#41; and was also responsible in some manner for a substantial
    amount of the funding for B42. Schoeffer was a copyist in Paris and may have had
    a crucial role in the formatting of the book and fitting of the typeface.

  body: 'Scriptoria did two kinds of work: production of prestige editions and production
    of multiple copies of common texts that were needed for study or other regular
    use, e.g. breviaries. There is a world of difference between _Les tres riches
    heures du Duc de Berry_ and the breviary that the average monk would have to pray
    the daily office, if he had his own copy at all.&#42;  In both cases, again, what
    was being copied was the <i>text,</i> not the layout. The whole point of prestige
    editions was uniqueness of design, illumination and binding. In the case of the
    mass-produced texts, there simply was no need to match line-breaks or any similar
    level of layout detail. Many of them were quite hastily and untidily written --
    the ones you don&#39;t see reproduced in books about mediaeval manuscripts --,
    hence the attraction of printing to which Gerald refers. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42; Saint
    Francis would not allow his monks to own their own breviaries. In practical terms,
    since members of the mendicant orders moved about a lot and would not always be
    able to pray the office in a church, Franciscans must have been able to pray the
    office from memory, which is no small feat.'

  body: John <BR> <BR>In this thread I&#39;m seeing manuscript work being dumped into
    sort of the same time frame, as if all this stuff existed simultaneously, which
    is incorrect. <BR> <BR>In the Roman period there was extensive multiple copying
    of &#34;text.&#34; In the middle ages book work &#40;had retreated&#41; and was
    practiced at the mononastic level &#40;in Europe&#41; on a very singular level.
    But after the infusion of copied Arabian manuscripts &#40;of Greek and Roman work
    of antiquity&#41; through the Spanish corridor, there was massive copying going
    on in western Europe.  <BR> <BR>The work of the illumininated manuscript is also
    something different from this, especially in its later period &#40;following the
    advent of the printed book&#41; where it was aimed at the high end book market,
    which the printed book could not capture.

  body: Surely the main reason that scribes/monks copied line for line was that they

    they would create prestige and simple versions but to the same original formula.

  body: The actual lettering of the manuscripts was generally not done by scribes
    but by the copisti or copyists. The scribe was in charge of the editing and assembly
    of the text. Usually they worked from multiple, differing copies of the same text,
    wrote what they felt was a definitive version, then doled parts out to different
    copisti. The scribes&#39; version would not be bound so that it could be broken
    into signatures. Copisti would work on individual signatures of vellum or parchment
    which would then be assembled and bound. <BR> <BR>Scribes could read and write,
    while not all copisti could read. It wasn&#39;t part of the job since all they
    had to do was copy letter by letter. The scribe was usually the one who set the
    page layout for copisit to follow. <BR> <BR>John is correct in that most of the
    manuscripts of that time are not very attractive or even well written or lettered.
    Most of what we see reproduced is the best stuff, though the general quality improved
    over time as it became more of a commercial business. There were commercial scriptoria
    sucessfully operating into the 1500s side by side with printing. <BR> <BR>One
    reason for the lack of quality is the monastary system had no method of recruiting
    people who could write, as few people could write in the first place. The church
    had to take whoever showed up and train them. Imagine taking 30-40 people off
    the street and finding even one good writer or calligrapher in the bunch. And
    writing was especially bad amongst nobility because of the difficulty of finding
    people who could teach it, one of the reasons Charlemagne&#39;s educational efforts
    started with a school of writing and lettering, and the development of a codified
    style of lettering -- Carolingian <BR>George

  body: I believe that Roman scriptoria, staffed by literate slaves, did use a dictation
    method for copying scrolls.  <BR>The Catholic Encyclopedia states &#34;Various
    names were in use to distinguish the different classes of writers. In monasteries
    the term antiquarii was sometimes used for those monks who copied books, the common
    writers who despatched the ordinary business of the house being called librarii,
    or simply scriptores. If a scribe excelled in painting miniatures or initial letters
    he usually confined himself to such work, and was called illuminator, while one
    who worked chiefly on legal documents was a notarius&#34;. <BR>Tim
