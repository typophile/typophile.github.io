    Smith's</a href> near NYU that might be showing the game. They're more of a soccer
    (football) place, but give them a call and check.\r\n\r\nAs far as type and design
    wise...there are some great rare graphic design and type specimen bookstores in
    the design area of Manhattan. There's one I went to recently that is appointment
    only, I'll post the info as soon as I can find the business card. \r\n\r\nI abhor
    this place because I used to work there (and the people who run the place are
    scumbags, but that's a whole 'nother story) but it is a great bookstore where
    you can find some gems. It's almost mandatory that you stop by <a href=http://www.strandbooks.com/>Strand
    Books</a href>. They have a rare book floor you can check out there too.\r\n\r\nYou
    can find all kinds of design and type goodies in Manhattan from 14th Street to
    around 32nd from 5th Ave to 10th Ave (I know that's a large radius). <a href=http://www.centerforbookarts.org/>Center
    for Book Arts</a href> has some good info from time to time...give them a call
    and see if there are any type related workshops going on. I got to handset Univers
    one day during a workshop, which was pretty cool."
