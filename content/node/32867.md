  devoted to great typefaces.\r\n\r\nhttp://skreened.com/ is the brainchild of Ohio
  State University Visual Communication Design alum Daniel Fox, and the company specializes
  in producing made to order T-shirts from a large variety of available designs.\r\n\r\nSkreened
  also allows anyone to create their own online \"store\" to sell their designs, which
  is what I (design professor Paul Nini) have done with the Great Typefaces T-shirt
  Series, available at http://skreened.com/PaulNini\r\n\r\nThere is one group for
  sans-serif designs, and another for serif faces. Coming soon will be a group for
  decorative faces. So, if you feel so inclined, this is your chance to wear your
  favorite typeface on your chest.\r\n\r\nSkreened uses only American Apparel products
  - http://www.americanapparel.net  - in a variety of styles and sizes. Suggestions
  for any faces not currently included are welcome."

      must bow to Florida's current athletic superiority. But there's nothing wrong
      with second place -- better than plenty of others. And if you want it, I'm sure
      that Daniel will print it.\r\n\r\nPaul Nini\r\nDept of Design\r\nOhio State

    years of teaching. We expect him to stick around as an emeritus faculty, however.
    \r\n\r\nPeter Megert did \"retire\" some years ago to focus on professional practice,
    but he has been teaching with us part-time since then. We're very glad to have
    him. It's a great experience for our new visual communication design students
    to have their first typography course with someone who practiced in Switzerland
    in the 60s, was hired by Paul Rand to work at Westinghouse, etc.\r\n\r\nWill Kunz
    was at OSU as a guest instructor in the 70s, when we had a large number of well-known
    guests on a regular basis. Unfortunately the funds for such things dried up years
    ago. We do still have guests, but now it's just for a day ot two, as opposed to
    a whole academic term.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Dept of Design will celebrate its 40th
    anniversry in 2008. You're invited to join us for the various events.\r\n\r\nPaul
