body: I am using the latest Font Explorer (4.1) and CS 5 and was wondering if anyone
  knows a way to hide the system fonts from the font menus in InDesign. It's so irritating
  to have to scroll through Gujarati and Chalkduster when I'm trying to select a font.

  body: "I don't think it's possible, but that's a really great idea. Even better
    would be if you could create subsets of fonts to be displayed in the font menu,
    rather than every font installed.\r\n\r\nThere's actually a system-wide facility
    for this on Mac OS X (\"collections\"), but it's only accessible in apps that
    use the system font picker (the Fonts window in Cocoa apps)."

  body: "Maybe someone from Adobe will read this...!\r\n\r\nAlternatively, can I just
    delete those fonts from the system or will it cause problems? I can't imagine
    any circumstances under which I would want to use Chalkduster."

    some testing of what applications break when certain system fonts are missing,
    and a lot of them are apparently not really necessary.\r\n[[http://www.jklstudios.com/misc/osxfonts.html]]"

  body: "I use Font Explorer, not Font Book. But AHA! I just figured out how to deactivate
    the ones the system doesn't need!\r\n\r\nView: System Fonts: Show in Smart Sets.
    \r\n\r\nThen you can deactivate most of them (a few are clearly required, and
    are greyed out) then go to Hide Smart Sets et voila! Thanks Ralf."

    I haven't looked at it for a while but I think it discusses which fonts are used
    by the system and which aren't.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.extensis.com/downloads/font-management-best-practices-guides/"

  body: I shut off everything it would let me. The only downside is that now Chrome
    is displaying in Times Roman rather than whatever sans it had been using.
