<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I was wondering if this exists at all?
My dream-scenario is:
• I have a couple of FontLab-documents/templates.
• They all consists of empty glyphs connected to OpenType-script-code so I can just draw the characters inte their given places-
• One template-document could cover a basic font — and then up to a very advanced OpenType-featured document with full set of everything that is possible with Opentype.
If this is available, I could concentrate on the design only — and the code would already be written. The glyphs would be named etc.
Does it exist?

<div class=commentbody>Yes it does (I think FreeFont Pro). You should have gotten it when you bought FL5. It is one of the freefonts. The boxes are not blank but all you need do is duplicate the file and replace the glyphs in it with your own drawings.

<div class=commentbody>Yes, I got this document freefontpro.vfb.
Does this cover ALL features?
I was however thinking of a more "structured" system of templates with maybe different sets of features, so – if I just want the regular characters + lets say swashes – a document/template would already be there (aswell as thirty more templates for other purposes)
In this freefont – If I just want some of the features, I have to sit and take away a lot of things.
I guess it's about saving time and effort, and instead focus on the design process.
Maybe it's a good business idea? =) To make templates for FontLab, I mean.

It is easy to delete features you are not using.

<div class=commentbody>Chris:
Not that I'd consider doing this--I don't even own a copy of FontLab, just TypeTool--but purely for information's sake:
If it's just that easy to use Freefont as a template for new OT fonts, what would prevent people from creating OT fonts from their existing T1 and TT fonts? There must be a reason why foundries take so long to come out with the OT versions of their catalog. --MM.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It is not that easy actually. It certainly is easier if you have drawn all the glyphs already for say an expert set and multi-lingual sets. by adding a few hundred glyphs, you have multiplied the kerning requirements quite a bit. You have to adjust all the fontmetrics as well. If you have lots of combining to do with diacritics, your job is even bigger.
There is nothing to prevent people from making OTF fonts from T1 or ttf fonts as long as the EULA permits it but that is a big if. Thieves and pirates probably do what you said but they are probably more likely to just steal a font and redestribute it to avoid all the work. My theory is that thieves are thieves because they are too lazy to do the work themselves.
Foundries may have thousands of fonts in their catalogs as well as new ones coming out. Foundries these days don't have big staffs so they have to prioritize what to do first. It may sound simple but try it. You will be surprised how much work is involved after all the outlines are drawn and done.

<div class=commentbody>Chris:
So, if I understand right, all using FL's Freefont Pro as a template does is to save you the trouble of generating all the OT features from scratch. You still have to (re)do all the kerning and metrics yourself.
Well, that would deter me if I were a pirate. It seems like combining even fonts with low glyph counts with their pro sets would be pretty time-consuming, even if you cribbed some of the content for the new tables from the orginal tables. --MM.</div>
