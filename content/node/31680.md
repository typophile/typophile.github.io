    Bold Italic</a> is similar if you tighten the tracking and squint a bit...

    Bold italic could be a nice alternative. '

  body: "The 'v' and 'm' seem to be designed for connecting, but the letters have
    been crammed together so that they can't connect. It reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/underware/bello/script/\">Bello
    Script</a>, also by Underware, but it's not that. \r\n\r\nIt has a script 'feel',
    but I wonder if it could be the italic of some casual display face. I sure don't
    recognize it, which naturally makes me want to say 'custom font', but I know that's
    an easy way out. \r\n\r\nScripts are so 'in' right now, that it could be something
    new I just haven't seen yet. I think heavy connecting scripts are always in demand,
    judging from the steady stream of 'Eclat' ID requests that are always trickling
    in. If I was a font designer that's what I'd be working on.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike
