body: Does anyone know of any script fonts that are noticeably "1970s"? I've used/tweaked
  "Creampuff" for my logotype, but I'm not happy with it...

  body: "Groovin is noticeably \"1960s\".\r\nSeymour Chwast's Artone logo (1964) is
    iconic for this \"fat bottom\" style.\r\nThe font is probably named after the
    Young Rascals song (1967).\r\nHowever, although bell-bottom trousers/pants were
    invented in the 60s, their heyday was the early 70s."

  body: "\"Groovin\" was a very 60s term that came out of the Haight hippie vernacular.
    The lettering was best seen in work known as Family Dog\r\nhttp://www.wolfgangsvault.com/se/family-dog-series/FD.html\r\n\r\nThe
    early 70s was actually what most people remember as 60s look. The Beatles Rubber
    Soul album shows a glimpse of that fat bottom look. There was a great Art Nouveau
    influence as well.\r\n\r\n ChrisL"
