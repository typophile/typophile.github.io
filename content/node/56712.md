body: I've searched the internet and all my books but I can't find this one. It's
  a metal font with a single nick and a pinmark that just says "18". The case it's
  in is labeled "Rosa 18 point".

  body: "That's a fascinating typeface. I searched through McGrew's book on \"American
    Metal Typefaces\" and the closest resemblance I found (only in the uppercase)
    was Bulfinch Oldstyle. The lowercase was not even close. It looks to me like an
    early 20th century style, but what else do you know about it? Is it American?
    How old?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: It was part of a collection of type I bought that also included some uncommon
    faces like Vendome, Carolus and Libra. There's a discussion about this going on
    at Briar Press - http://www.briarpress.org/16322#comment-9941.
