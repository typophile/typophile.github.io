  be doing some re-decorating soon and I'd love to adorn one of the hallway walls
  (a slender and curving beauty, I might add) with some type-based wallpaper. Big
  letters, small letters, the odd number and diacritic, a few, handpicked punctuation
  marks, you get the picture. Alas, I haven't found any yet. Any ideas where I might
  find such a thing? \r\n"

  body: "Thanks maxgraphic, that's a decent start. It really is difficult to find,
    especially because you basically can't google for it, because of desktop wallpaper
    usurping the name.\r\n\r\nIf all else fails I suppose I can always either print
    my own or break out the scanner, project & trace type onto standard wallpaper.
    Another idea might be something from Stefan Sagmeister's book: Mask off areas
    of sheets of wallpaper with type, then leave in the sun to fade, finally peel
    off the mask. Oh well, the search goes on, I appreciate the help."

    printed material? i like the thought of have all these random letters and words
    covering everything... it's an idea.... once placed on the  wall you could cover
    it with a clear varnish-type thing to preserve the paper...\r\n\r\nit's an idea...\r\n\r\nanother
    is to just make the wallpaper yourself and get it large-format printed... like
    a billboard....\r\n\r\ncheers - sye :)"

    finds! I really like the Maharam paper. If it's not too expensive to ship and
    buy I think I'll go for it in beige and white, it would be perfect.\r\n\r\nOnce
    again: Thanks to all typophiles, I knew you could be relied upon for this \"problem\".
