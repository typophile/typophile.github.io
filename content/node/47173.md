  Please have a look at the [[http://www.pedros-paella.de|old website]]. It's essentially
  a one-man catering company that provides Spanish paella dishes and everything that
  goes with it.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for is a typeface that has a particularly
  \"Spanish\" feel to it. Can anybody recommend such a typeface? I've been looking
  at some Spanish art books, but couldn't find anything.\r\n\r\nThanks for any input
  in this matter!"

    national character. Perhaps if you give a bit more information on the feel you
    are trying to evoke you might get more targeted suggestions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
    a standard suggestion would be to use something by an Iberian designer. If I associate
    something with Spain, it is a certain oldness and Baroque styling, so I might
    suggest Mario Feliciano's <a href=http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=22>Rongel</a>
    (taken from a Spanish model) or <a href=http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_debula.html>Caligrafia

    about nationality and type. He did a paper and a typeface 'Rayuela' \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pampatype/rayuela/\r\n\r\nBut
    here is a Spanish national star in another now playing in Valencia.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/montanha

  body: Thanks, Vince; I remember reading in both Lo Celso's and Martinez Meave's
    writings their feeling that they create certain typefaces made for the Spanish
    language. But since Timo's website uses German, I wonder whether they would say
    that the type's linguistic character still applies.

  body: "Out of the list of Reed's suggestions, I'd go with, in order of just how
    old he wants things to look:\r\n\r\nRongel (newer)\r\nFleischman\r\nLagarto (older)\r\n\r\nRongel
    is a good bit more contemporary but looks a little bit more formal (as Fleischman
    borders on oldfashioned) so if it's a very formal restaurant I'd go with Rongel.
    \ If a little less pricy of a restaurant I'd go with Fleischman.  Lagarto maybe
    as headers could work.  I definitely wouldn't use Lisboa, as it's called Lisboa
    for a reason, it perfectly captures that city but doesn't work for most any Spanish
    cities that I can think of (In general Portuguese design tends to be a bit lighter
    and rounder than that of Spain)\r\n\r\nIf you want to go handwriting wise for
    anything in the style of Spaniards, the key things to note:\r\n\r\ndots over the
    I even when capital, the 1s look more like ^, the 9s look like gs, the 7 and Zz
    always carry the bar through them, and the tilde looks like a macron over the
    n.  The A often looks more like a delta (bottom left to top to bottom right and
    then a line either horizontal or diagonal to make the bar, butall in one stroke),
    the lowercase r often looks like an r rotunda (or a cursive r without the initial
    stroke, or a very small nob instead of the full stroke), the cursive f looks like
    an cursive esh, and the cursive z is like a print z with swoop and no cross (or
    a french 3).  And they don't use cursive capital letters (as I quickly found out
    as people couldn't read half the stuff I wrote).\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una

  body: "Hey you guys,\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for all your suggestions! Yes, the type
    is only for the logo. The company is essentially a one-man business of a Ukranian
    guy living in Germany and claiming to be Spanish. People can book him and he'll
    come over and cook a fabulous paella for them. What a shame that you guys can't
    try it... (I did last weekend!).\r\n\r\nMy current favourites are Lisboa and Borges.
    Unfortunately, due to the current workload, I cannot start with this project before
    end of next week. I'll post the first draft of my website + logo as soon as I
    can! Thanks for your help so far...\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

    to be based on a Mexican face which it was before being imported there from Spain,
    before being imported there from Holland. It all took several hundred years, which
    is about right for paella in a Ukraino-Germanic context.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    draft of the website]]. It also includes a logo which I made. It is based on the
    font Chaparral Pro, which isn't actually Spanish but does a fairly good job at
    this particular task I think. The focus in this project is on web design and photography
    anyway. There's no budget for developing a more complex brand identity.\r\n\r\nPlease
    let me know what could be improved further. Thanks for any input...\r\n\r\nP.S.
    Sorry for the site being in German only. But you will get the gist of it. It's
    just a chef specialising in cooking paella. Quite a simple concept actually!!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign
