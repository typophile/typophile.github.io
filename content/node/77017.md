body: "Hi everyone, just wondering if anyone can help me pick a font to go with LT
  chickenhawk (http://www.dafont.com/lt-chickenhawk.font).\r\n\r\nWe've fallen in
  love with this font, although we're planning to tweak it a bit for our purposes
  - and want to use it to write our company name on signage and business cards. (We're
  doing tea and cake so like the cutesy handmade feel of it)\r\n\r\nI'm trying to
  find a suitable body font to go with it and really struggling - I'm not generally
  a fan of script-type fonts, but other fonts I've looked at look sterile and out
  of place next to this hand drawn font. Any suggestions?"

  body: "I would try with a narrow-ish light slab-serif.\r\nWhich could complement
    the letter shapes, but contrast the feel, so that the text would be legible and
    help the rest stand out more."

  body: "Thanks riccard0, that's a good idea. For now, if anyone's interested, I'm
    thinking Nadia (http://quersicht.ch/04_labor/04_ft_nadi.html) though I'll have
    to draw some characters (like @) to go with it.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for the other
    suggestion bojev - I did think about using another of Nymphont's typefaces in
    that style, but they're too similar for what I have in mind and not legible enough."
