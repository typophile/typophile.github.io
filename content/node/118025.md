  body: "I know that, in the past, Disney employed a team of masterful lettering artists
    who hand-made signage. I don't know if this is still true today, but plenty of
    Disney-related fonts have been, in fact, made after the fact to simulate such
    lettering.\r\n\r\nI strongly suspect that your Horseshoe Saloon sign is a custom
    creation. If so, it might be that another Disney-inspired font, <a href='http://www.disneyexperience.com/customize/fonts/?page=1'
    target='_blank'>Gracey's Curse</a> may be as close as you get digitally. The font
    was created by Robert Nava (who also runs the website I've linked you to) to simulate
    some Haunted Mansion lettering."

    head\" font like this one... . What I could say for sure is your second sample
    is full of commercial fonts ('Proudly Presents' > [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/ballantines+script|Ballantines
    Script]], 'DAI...' > [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/blackoak|Blackoak]],
    'ENTERTAINMENT' > [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/buffalo-gal|Buffalo Gal]]).
    It would be interesting also to see the complete artwork.\r\nFor inspiration,
    I strongly encourage you to have a look to [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/FontMesa|FontMesa]],
    [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com|Letterhead Fonts]] and [[http://decadetypefoundry.bigcartel.com|Decade

  body: "The only 'Hand food chopper head' font that comes to mind is an old Letraset
    font called Locomotive, which was revived in the Expresiv Ornate collection as
    \"Lender\". However, it is less ornate than this sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "According to my Letraset catalog Locomotive is a Martin Wait design. No mention
    of it among the digital fonts by Martin Wait listed at Identifont or Myfonts.
    Lender currently exists as a digital font in the usual places.\r\nUPDATE:\r\nLender
    is fairly well made. Perhaps it could be modified to make the letters.\r\nDon"
