    I cannot confirm that.\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nFlorian"

    1945, the first newspaper license given by the US Military Government in Germany

    - strong and free.\r\n\r\nEvery successful newspaper in the world has its own
    strong face, controlled by its layouters. I found this striktly rules everywhere
    in Europe and US, too. E.g. the Sun in London has its own girlie macro for page
    3. (I know it, 'cause I wrote the first version of it in 1986(?) being part of
    \"No Stopping - Wapping\", when Mr. Murdoch broke the big fleet street strike
    together with 70 Kodak newspaper spezialists :-)\r\n\r\nA change of a layout or
    only a font is a major thing. They discuss it for months before changes will appear.
    And what ever they change: Lots of readers of the paper will give protest. They
    want their paper like it was before.\r\n\r\nSo - to write \"The Helvetica headlines
    hurt my eyes\" is not enough for a discussion about a newspaper's layout bible.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

    involved in, say, the design of a car \u2013 and I might still not like it (but
    my neighbour does). So in a harmless chat like that it\u2019s perfectly ok to
    express one\u2019s taste.\r\nBesides, you needn\u2019t teach my about newspaper
    layouts \u2013 I\u2019m working in this business.\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nFlorianG"

  body: "I remember the S\xFCddeutsche Zeitung's masthead from when I studied in Stuttgart.
    I had a friend that loved that 'g' and used to refer to it as \"the g that looks
    like a baby\". I'm still not sure what makes that 'g' resemble a baby, but I have
    admit that she's right.\r\n\r\nIn terms of design I've always preferred the <a
    href=\"http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/\">Stuttgarter Zeitung</a>. It's one
    of the few that uses [[Gerard Unger|Unger's]] <a href=\"http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns14.html\">Gulliver</a>."

    to his personal taste. That's not the question. But nevertheless its senseful
    to think about the reasons for a decision like this S\xFCddeutsche layout.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I said is: \r\nIts not enough to say \"My personal taste tells me: \"These Helvetica
    headlines hurt my eyes.\" Not in a semi-pro or pro forum. Otherwise it would be
    the same level than a whatever-do-I-want-to-do-next-weekend-forum.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I did not want to tell you how newspaper layout works, Florian. I tried to start
    a small and senseless smalltalk about the newspaper business, where I am coming
    from and which I love. That's all.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"
