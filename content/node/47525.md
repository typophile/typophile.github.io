  about Gentium, the free font I suppose most of you know about.\r\n\r\nTrying out
  this font, I thought it looked strikingly crappy in Word, compared to when you print
  it (the same page from Word). This difference may be common, but it seems greater
  for Gentium. I think it's beautiful on paper, but it's just horrible and not very
  legible in Word.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder, how come? What is it about Gentium that causes
  this?\r\n\r\nThe difference I'm talking about is for example smaller for Verdana
  or Calibri, typefaces designed to be legible on screen as well as on paper.\r\n\r\nJurriaan"

    Gentium Book Basic, 11 pt.\r\n\r\nI was thinking maybe it's just how Word generates
    type on screen (any typeface).\r\n\r\nA note to Italian speakers: the text was
    babelfish-generated. \r\n\r\nHere's another example at 12 pt, comparing with Times
    New Roman (2nd paragraph):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gentium2_4920.gif]\r\n\r\nOn
    my screen in Word it looks worse by the way (without Cleartype, which I don't
    like). \r\n\r\nThe problem is probably less bad when using a screen with a higher
    resolution than 72 ppi, like some mac screens have.\r\n\r\nJurriaan"

  body: What you are seeing is the font displayed in bilevel rendering or black and
    white pixels. The font is hinted, but not well, the hinting on the italics are
    worse it seems, so proportions and spacing are bad. Making a font look like the
    print version using black and white pixels is never going to work, no matter if
    it is in Word or not. ClearType certainly does make the font look closer to the
    printed version.

    in a closer approximation in 'look' to the printed output.

    pitch]]. I think if in the future we have screens with smaller dot pitches of
    over 300 dpi, screen type will get more legible (the contrast for example is already
    good enough I think). I think the greater the dpi, the smaller the visible difference
    between anti-aliased and non-anti-aliased, right?\r\nAnd then type would look
    good on screen, even in Word! :)\r\n\r\nJurriaan\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The problem, as was suggested earlier, is from hinting. \r\nVerdana TNR and
    Calibri were all manually hinted, meaning a person applied all the truetype instructions,
    assessed the results, and adjusted as necessary, for every letter in the font,
    especially at screen display sizes. \r\n\r\nGentium looks passable in the Roman,
    but displays more problems in the italics. The fonts were probably autohinted.
    An autohinter can be tuned to give decent results in more predictable situations,
    like most traditional upright designs, but when the same algorithms are applied
    to the italic designs, they often make incorrect decisions, and the results look
    worse than unhinted at display sizes. The issue is that the autohinter is applying
    hints in either the horizontal or vertical direction within the character, so
    it doesn't know what to do when it finds an oblique stem. In the lower case \"a\",.
    it obviously made a very poor \"choice\"\r\nHuman hinters can apply diagonal hint
    instructions to alleviate those problems, but obviously this is a time consuming
    process. \r\n\r\n"
