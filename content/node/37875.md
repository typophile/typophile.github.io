  to make an experiment with my logotype:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yaronimus

  you see - i already made a hebrew blackletter version of my name,\r\nand now i want
  to make another translation into arabic, so the logotype\r\nwill be tri-lingual
  (i hope it's pronounced okay). \r\nmy goal in this, is first to make an experiment,
  \r\nand maybe to use this in my logotype, so it would appeal to larger audience
  \r\nthat may collaborate with me on designs not just for a hebrew speaking israeli
  audience,\r\nand not just for western audience, but to arabic as well.\r\n\r\nmy
  question is - is there an earlier example of arabic typeface or logo in a blackletter
  \r\nstyle?\r\ni understand it can be quite dificult, because every language has
  it's own needs, but im looking forward to it.\r\n\r\ni guess that there is no typeface
  that is ready, so it would be great if you can recomend on several plain fractured
  arabic types, to start working on them as a basis.\r\n\r\nwould the \"kufi\" type
  face be suitable?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arabic-styles_5910.jpg]\r\nanother

  body: The ornamented Kufi sample you show is visually almost a blackletter. You'd
    just have to raise the height of the shorter vertical strokes to the x-height
    of the other scripts you've used already, making them barley more than a stroke's
    breadth shorter than the taller vertical strokes, plus some other cosmetic changes.
    I have no idea whether these changes would render the Arabic script illegible.
