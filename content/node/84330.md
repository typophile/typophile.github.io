body: "Some of my installed fonts show up as separate typefaces on the type menu in
  InDesign, Photoshop etc. Others show just the typeface name then list each font
  separately.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer that as many as possible showed as Typefacename then
  all the weights were on the next menu.\r\n\r\nI can't even search this forum for
  answers because I simply don't even know what it's called when the files are formatted
  into proper families.\r\n\r\nMy more recent purchases seem to have this feature
  but faces from my old Adobe CD don't group in this way.\r\n\r\nIs there a program
  that I can buy which will allow me to round-up a family and convert it so they stick
  together.\r\n\r\nSorry in advance for the poor explanation, I just don't know the
  correct words. I hope you guys understand what I mean."

  body: Thanks David. Seems that FontLab can sort these out? Would Extenis' FontDoctor
    or something else be more suited to this task?
