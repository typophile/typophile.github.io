  \r\n\r\nAny chance of a So-Cal Typophile lunch or something? \r\n\r\nMay 19th to
  the 23rd are the dates I have potentially available. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "You are right that LA is about 1.5hrs away from San Diego (with light traffic).
    Umm as for type tourism... hmmm. There are typographically interesting places
    all over LA county. But if you focus on the downtown area of LA or San Diego you
    find a richer experience (typographic or otherwise)...\r\n\r\nWhat kind of things
    do you want to see? Old signs/buildings, graphic design schools, people, museums?\r\n\r\nMikey
    Diaz\r\n\r\nPS... If you come out here you must try Mexican food! Avoid places
    that have lots white clientele as this is a big indicator that the food has been
    watered down for the American palette. Or upscale mexican restaurants. If you
    want the real deal you have to go were the all the brown people are. The holes
    in the wall are the best- they have lots of customers. All our restaurants have
    health ratings on the front of the establishments- eat at places with a big A
    on the front!\r\n\r\nHrant is from LA too maybe he can chime in on this one. I've
    always wanted to try Armenian food but every time I'm in the Glendale area I never
    stay long enough to explore."

    made me laugh out loud. Thanks! Thanks for the advice Mike!\r\n\r\nAs far as type
    tourism / resources are concerned I suppose I would keenest on:\r\n\r\n- Libraries
    with special Type & Calligraphic collections\r\n- Bookstores of note\r\n- Type-people
    \ who are maybe not on Typophile who are in that area & who I might like to meet
    & talk with\r\n- And any general advice for the area you might want to pass on
    as you ( Mike) have done.\r\n\r\nFor context I should perhaps also say I have
    been to the LA / San Diego area before 4-5 times before but usually for just 3-4
    days."

    hours? Either you drive worse/better than me, or you're talking about making it
    to the edge of LA county. Eben, the way I'm picturing an Alaskan driving to somewhere
    he'd enjoy ending up, it'll be over 2 hours, with medium traffic. With heavy traffic
    it could take over 4.\r\n\r\nMexican food: from San Diego it takes like 20 minutes
    to get to Tijuana! Which is not to say that they don't have the gringo problem
    there too... BTW Mike, an \"A\" rating is actually a similar problem.  :-)  I
    once filled out a complaint card at a Fatburger that it was too clean. They called
    me back. I'll tell you the rest one day.\r\n\r\nArmenian food: you'll have to
    make it to Hollywood, Glendale or Pasadena.\r\n\r\n> Libraries with special Type
    & Calligraphic collections\r\n\r\nWhat you want is the Clark. But since they don't
    let you check anything out (they MIGHT let you take flash-less photos, maybe)
    bring a sleeping bag. Bookstores: are you buying or browsing?\r\n\r\nIf you can
    hook up with Margo Chase, do it.\r\n\r\nGeneral advice: bring a swimsuit and your
    driver's license.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    you need a passport now.\r\n\r\nWhen in San Diego, pub crawl from one end of the

    make sure you don't cross back Sunday night: you'll spend a couple of hours in
    your car listening to a chorus of cebradita.\r\n\r\nAnd if you've got cojones
    bring back some Cuban cigars. I did that last time, and when the border guy asked
    me \"What's in the back?\" I said \"some talavera\", which is what all the gringos
    buy. (Actually I did have some talavera too, so it was a careful lie.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I go it surprises me again with it's excellence. I have tried to find better and
    couldn't.\r\n\r\nCorner of Brand Boulevard and California.\r\n\r\nClose to there
    is Brand Books\r\nhttp://www.abebooks.com/servlet/StoreFrontDisplay?cid=66145\r\nHonestly
    I can't tell you if there's lots of typographic resources - haven't been there
    in a while but it is one of the last standing used book stores. I like it a lot.\r\n\r\nBest
    fast food in LA is also Armenian - Zankou Chicken. There's one of those in Glendale
    on Colorado near the 2 freeway. It is REALLY good!\r\n\r\nOK - real Mexican food
    with a wide array of not commonly seen sauces:\r\nLa Caba\xF1ita in Monrovia (actually
    your could just say Glendale) - lots of different kinds of mole and other sauces
    you won't find just anywhere - it's excellent.\r\n\r\nGuelaguetza - A Oaxacan
    restaurant in the middle of Koreatown - they specialize in mole (which the Oaxacans
    are known for) - try the mole negro if you've never had it - it is fantastic.
    You could also try some edible bugs while you're there if you are really adventurous.\r\n\r\nThere
    is now an area in the middle of Koreatown that is known as Little Oaxaca. \r\n\r\nSo
    that's my input for LA.\r\n\r\npeace\r\n\r\n"

    the work?! :-(  Well, you can go to\r\nUCLA instead - they have gobs of goodies,
    like Aldine originals.\r\n\r\n> suggestions?\r\n\r\nI once had her email, but
    she never replied, so you're on your own dude.\r\n\r\nPaul, you know Carousel!
    It's very nice, although a bit pricey. Zankou: that's actually where I took Norbert
    during his visit last hear. It's definitely delectable, especially if you like
    garlic. BTW, really traditional Armenian food tends to be hard to cook and sort
    of anachronistic, so virtually any \"Armenian\" restaurant will mostly have dishes
    of general Near-Eastern origin (mostly either Lebanese or Persian, depending on
    the owner). But that's not bad news at all!\r\n\r\nAnd you know La Caba\xF1ita
    too! (You probably meant Montrose, not Monrovia, right?) It's actually 2 minutes
    from my house. It's a small place (recently expanded actually) that's as authentic
    as you can get in these neck of the woods. The last time I went they still didn't
    have a liquor license, so they were making their margaritas with wine, but the
    food is super super. Guelaguetza, I'll have to try. Then there's King Taco in
    East LA: the best/worst time to go is late late.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Glendale.\r\n\r\nOne Friday night I was eating at Guelaguetza and got out of there
    about 8pm. I guess they also have a club because there were a group of people
    that seemed to be waiting to get in. What were they doing while waiting? Listening
    to Oaxacan music on a boombox and performing group folk dances in the parking
    lot. Really cool.\r\n\r\nCorner of Normandie and Olympic. There's another one
    on 8th Street but it's full of TVs and when soccer is on - it's on and poppin'
    if you like that sort of thing. Not really for me.\r\n\r\nKing Taco is the real
    deal - carne asada tacos to die for. Lengua too if you're into it - I like it
    a lot.\r\n\r\npeace"
