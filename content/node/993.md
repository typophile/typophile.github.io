  body: Hi emma, pretty risky, to ask such a question on a forum like this. <BR> <BR>To
    start simple, let us first scale the design disciplines to graphic design.  <BR>
    <BR>You will not come around the fact that text will have to be used in graphic
    design. Even if its one drawn character at 8 pt. on a big poster. <BR> <BR>I think
    typography can be seen as one of the graphic design tools. Like for example color
    is one. Every decision you take, that has to do with text, even if you decide
    to use all the possible default settings, or even the decision not to use text,
    is typography. <BR> <BR>Design is the resulting balance of all the decisions you
    took of how to use and into what effect, of all the design tools. Such as color,
    size, paper, typography, psycology, language, target public, marketing theories
    and so on... <BR> <BR>---Jacques

  body: Not much to say from me. <BR> <BR>Personally I think I have wasted my life
    in typography and recommend against participating in it. <BR> <BR>It is highly
    contagious, and I think for some, incurable. I don&#39;t think they have yet clearly
    defined it&#39;s specific cause but apparently it inflicts people with laughter,
    wild romantic dreams, imaginary travel and the desire to spend money they do not
    have.  <BR> <BR>Some have come to pretend to be great prophets of both knowledge
    and wisdom. They are noted for preaching incredible thoughts simultaneously wearing
    heavy round &#34;glass contraptions on their noses which are wired to their ears&#34;.
    Some, are shockingly serious! Worse, others influence innocent young children
    in schools causing them to become taxpayers. You just know the trouble that causes.
    <BR> <BR>And that&#39;s just the people that look at it! <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald

    Its better than loothing done the streets, lurking on a bottle, packed in paper
    &#40;in the US&#41;, or without paper &#40;europe&#41; <BR> <BR>---Jacques

  body: This is the best way I can explain it Emma, I was just going to write your
    name in few differents types but I couldn&#39;t help it, an hiperactive day I
    guess and it looks you have a fun name to work with... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14526.gif"
    alt="emma"> <BR> <BR>I think that there is a lot of power of expression in the
    letters, the same is not  THE SAME, and we should  use it. <BR>And agree with
    Jacques, the paper is also very important in this matter of graphic design. <BR>

  body: Hello fans, good morning from Finland! <BR> <BR>Jacques &amp; Hrant, <BR>
    <BR>Typography started for me when innocently drinking in my youth with this man
    who spouted the doctrines of the &#34;black arts&#34;. <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/WilHudson.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/WilHudson.html</a> <BR> <BR>So this
    could happen to your child? <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/GiampaPipePress.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/GiampaPipePress.html</a> <BR> <BR>Oh,
    just think, I started off as one sweet lovable little baby born in a tent only
    to become a dastardly run-away-printer when I was at the tender age of 13. What
    an unlucky number. <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/GiampaIntroduction.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/GiampaIntroduction.html</a> <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    exactly what happened to me. That &#34;evil alcohol&#34; led me straight down
    the path to typography. <BR> <BR>And just look at me now. <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/GiampaSummerFinland.html"
