body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nin my current font ([[Brevier Ten]]) \xD8 and \xF8 bar
  does not extend through the center counter of the O, o instead it only extends from
  the outer portions of the letter. \r\n\r\nA bar through the center would certainly
  be more legible but with a broken bar texture/color would be way better and I think
  it would match the overall type design better, too (similar thing going on with
  $ and \xA2).\r\n\r\nSince Brevier Ten is a typeface for body copy, question is if
  those broken bars are too hard to read or acceptable. \r\n\r\nWhat do Danish and
  Norwegian readers think about that? :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-3_3967.jpg]"

    does this. Then the mind has no problem filling in the missing detail of the slash

    as a stylistic or titling alternate - it looks kinda cool and could perhaps be
    used for effect, even though it is unreadable for running text.\r\nThe slash should
    always cross the O completely. For bolder weights the tight counter space may
    call for more creative solutions like this, of course - but such a glyph design
    for a light weight is not good. It may look clever and stylish, but it just shows
    ignorance about the languages it is used for.\r\nNice typeface, though - very

    with the upper case \"O\", then the thickness of the slash will share the same
    relationship, and be thinner in the lower case \xF8."

    the \"O\", but its counter is also smaller, so that a slash of the same actual
    thickness looks thicker. You have nice open forms so using the same stroke thickness
    for lowercase and uppercase may work in general, but in the \"\xF8\" the stroke
    density is greater so you do need the optical correction. Squint and try to compare
    the apparent thickness of the two slashes."

    \xF8 without the bar in the counter has been seen before (for example in the logo
    of [[http://www.foroya.fo/|F\xF8roya Banki]]. The Faroese use \xF8 as well) and
    would be definitely be idenfied as an \xF8. Only problem is that it attracts too
    much attention. So it really depends on the purpose of your typeface. For a corporate
    typeface it might work, for body copy it is far more distracting than a slight
    uneveness in colour.\r\n\r\nRegarding the colour, pay attention to Frode's advice.
    It might be necessary to break the bar in three (but not always), whereas it is
    almost always necessary to thin the strokes of the o where the bar crosses.\r\n\r\nBon
    courage.\r\n"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI don't speak danish, but I do think that the \xD8 is more than
    simply an alternate version of O, it's a character of it's own, just like \xDC,
    \xC4, \xD6 etc. in german. It would be wrong to treat these as 2nd rate. I think
    it looks quite interesting for a logo, but would not work for texts. I think the
    real challenge here is to work with the \xD8 and create it in such a way that
    it doesn't become to dark, or too cluttered. I think it's very much a question
    of optics. You could work with a tapered stroke, or ink traps to avoid too much
    density. Consider it a challenge, rather than a hassle.\r\n\r\nJeffrey  "

  body: Part of the smallcap thickness is playing the counter space against the stroke
    width to end up with even color with lowercase. The more open your counters, the
    thicker your stroke. The closer your counter width to that of the lowercase, the
    closer your stem width as well.

    identical, but that a long line may appear thicker than a shorter line in some
    situations but thinner in other situations. This is affected not only by whether

    glyph, i.e. it's an aspect of overall spatial frequency."
