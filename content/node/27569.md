body: "Starting to build a look/feel for my portfolio website. The attached image
  shows the latest version. One of my best friends (also a designer) commented that
  the 'dm' logo and the \"Dylan...\" custom type compete instead of compliment each
  other. He suggested that I scrap the custom type and just spell out my name using
  a sans serif such as the one used in the navigation (which is House's United 'face.)\r\n\r\nDo
  you agree that a simpler typeface like United would be a better visual compliment
  to the 'dm' mark? Or should I keep this custom type solution?\r\n\r\nTypophiles,
  what say ye?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDylan\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/home_v3_lo5_LAYERS_3465.jpg]"

    logo, which is better than the type.\r\n\r\nWhat about setting your name in United,
    too?\r\n\r\nYou could keep the custom type elsewhere, perhaps, like in the \"WELCOME\"
    and\"LOOSE SKETCHES\""

  body: 'I love the custom font. Think changing it to United will ruin it. Don''t
    be bullied into turning your signature into a corporate logotype. However, I would
    give thought to descending Y and ascending which may be the things that are starting
    to competing with the dM device. Have you considered a different colour for the
    dM? eg gold/yellow #FFCC00 which will help the dM not be outplayed by ''DYLAN
    MENGES'' logotype.'

  body: "Great feedback, everyone. Thank you for weighing in. I'm still a bit torn
    as to how to finish this 'problem.' My gut check on this is still not quickly
    answering one approach or the other, although, if you put a gun to my head and
    said 'decide'...I think I would let the logo be curvalinear and leave the type
    more formal. Let the other subheads do the hand-drawn work. That's where I'm at.
    \r\n\r\nAnyone else care to weigh in? As I mentioned in my other thread about
    this logo (see Personal Logo), putting the work in front of you maniacs is a sort
    of final review, as I highly respect the talent that surges through these forums.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    thank you.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Darrel made a good point separate the hand lettering from the mark, or letter
    your name in a similar style of the m, not in the 3d form of your logo perhaps
    (although you could use the M in the centre as a coner with the other characters
    leading off). I feel that since the masthead is the first thing that will be seen
    you should show your talents there.\r\nTim"

  body: Dylan, one thing you might consider is having your mark in white and the type
    in the darker red. I'd also consider scaling the  mark a bit larger and the type
    a bit smaller. The mark is great and I'd let it shine more.

    about the flames. One color, zero blend, dark red ... maybe?
