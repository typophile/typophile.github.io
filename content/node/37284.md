  body: "I wish I had had a camera about 15 years ago as I was driving in rural northwest
    Indiana. Out of the corn fields came an old-fashioned milk delivery truck with
    its name, etc emblazoned in very faded red and blue Peignot. It was a startling
    departure from the usual script lettering seen on so many of those vehicles of
    my boyhood. With all its angled lines it could have been lifted off a French poster
    from decades earlier. I have remembered it all these years. Sorry, no photos.\r\n\r\npowers"
