    you will find that /u/ suddenly looks too tall. This is because the q, for some
    vague and illusive reason, needs to align to the x-height stronger. Either you
    make the curve very flat at the top, or you add a little triangle, like Lexicon.\r\n\r\nYou
    might want to try increasing the contrast in the bold, as to make the thins the
    same thickness as the thins in the regular. The bold probably looks too light
    to you, because you put the semi-bold in between the regular and the bold. Bold
    has the same problems as the regular (b, q, and s), along with one extra: The
    whitespace in /m/ is not equally devided.\r\n\r\nI get a very cosy Ms. Eaves feeling

    I think the weight in the bowl of 'a' could be a bit more horizontal though. M/N/S
    are too heavy in the italic and the italic 'W' seems a bit too wide.\r\n\r\nWhy
    are the arrow symbols without contrast? The scissors look deformed as the grip
    seems to be too thin.\r\n\r\n<cite>Right now, I'm leaning towards Bantam or Essex.
    Both appear not to be taken.</cite>\r\nI don't like having 'sex' in the word.
    Actually it doesn't make me think of sex but of Sussex. Both are associations
    I would avoid though.\r\n\r\nGarvis somehow makes me think of a web font, which
    makes it sound cheap. Really, this might be a very personal association and has
    nothing \u2014 necessarily, anyway \u2014 to do with the quality of web fonts,
    but I still think it should be avoided (if others make the same association that
    is).\r\n\r\nBantam is also not fitting. It's a good name I think but it fits a
    more horizontal serif better. It would also be better to take a name without double
    letters though I certainly don't always come up with names conform to this \"rule\".\r\n\r\nA
    \"few\" names right off the bat (I haven't checked whether any of these exist
    already): Diluran, Atina, Nelan, Manora, Harmen, Werder, Coldre, Sermior, Beldor,
    Nuave, Myre, Verton, Ciller, Rezden, Pranu, Lisar, Solur, Betarn, Mastun, Abeling,

    Unstemar, Mardine, Hamewick, Piasoli, Molgen, Trigon, Gritude, Cheloir, Ratite,
    Nelwing, Dorman, Revenam, Eggerbit, Mitser, Santil...\r\nIt's not too hard coming
    up with names which sound good I think (unless you insist on using existing words).
    Just look at your typeface and try to make sounds which fit the style and atmosphere.
    Another good method I think is think of keywords which fit your typeface and come
    up with words which loosely relate to that keyword in terms of sounds or use of
    letters. For example, I derived 'Eupal' from 'euphoria', 'Gritude' from 'gratitude'
    and 'Santil' from 'sand hill'. Not that these (key)words fit your typeface but
    the derived names just might. Some of the names I mentioned are just rather obscure
    words (at least to me as English is not my primary language)."

    terminals go inwards. I think that and the design of the serifs \u2014 which fits
    beautifully together \u2014 is the character of this typeface.\r\n\r\nI'm on Windows
    7 and your font looks beautiful on your website. I've only tested in Safari though.
    I did see an issue which I experienced myself recently. When I select text, the
    letters wiggle around. The same happened to me when I added a few codes to force
    cleartype rendering as my client reported the text looked horrendous in Internet
    Explorer. I thought the wiggling around of the letters was an absolutely undesired
    effect so in the end I removed the code and went with a typeface which seemed
    to be hinted better so it looked good in all browsers without the code. I recommend
    to optimize the font for web instead of relying on your code."

    experience. But maybe even more so.\r\n\r\nIn a way designing an Armenian font
    brings you back to\r\nthe basics: the number of characters is not many since\r\nnot
    much beyond the alphabetics is required, but we have\r\naround 10 letters of the
    complexity of the binocular lc \"g\".\r\nAnd since a person is unlikely to be
    able to read Armenian\r\ntext, it becomes a powerful and rewarding abstract exercise.\r\nThere
    are \"rules\", but a lack of nativity means one has to\r\nlearn to figure them
    out, and the lessons then apply nicely\r\nto other non-Latin attempts. Armenian
    basically becomes\r\na superb introduction to non-native design, after which a\r\nperson
    might move on to things like Arabic and Devanagari.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Although in some ways it's becoming more mainstream, it's also starting to
    click - good job. There's a nice Fleischmann flavor, but it's not at all a revival.\r\n\r\nThe
    main thing to me is that you have a tricky decision to make: how far out on a
    limb do you want to go? Look at that /j. Fabulous. Dangerous. I think it's exactly
    the sort of thing a real text face needs; neutering it would constitute giving
    in to display setting, to superficial type design. If you're worried whether you've
    gone too far with it, remember how things that seem garish at large sizes blend
    in to the overall texture at text sizes - just look at Schwartz's Houston Chronicle*
    face, to me a pinnacle of functionalist bravado. But that <em>does</em> mean things
    like that /j have to make sense in that overall texture, and some other glyphs
    are not pulling their weight in that respect, so the whole is unlikely to be cohesive.
    The /y for example completely clashes with the /j; I would either give it a ball
    (quite possibly with a the Fleischmann \"flipped\" structure) or a big rightward
    serif** (or maybe double serifs, like in Bembo's italic). Similarly /k/x could
    benefit from having much more character, and /f could take the attitude of /j
    and -thanks to its bar- push it even further. And /g is also too conservative,
    too polished.\r\n\r\n* http://www.christianschwartz.com/houston.shtml\r\n\r\n**
    What famous font is it that has that?\r\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed is that some
    key glyphs are unusually wide - the /a/e/t. That does amplify the design's overall
    butch character, but know that it also reduces readability (at least I strongly
    believe so).\r\n\r\nThe /f/r should have longer rightward footserifs.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    it's always good to figure out what point size a given font likes most. For this
    I myself am seeing 11 pt. Just know that -at that size- the color is going to
    be somewhat darkish (something I personally value).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
