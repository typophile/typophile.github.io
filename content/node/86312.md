body: "hey guys\r\n\r\nI am quite new to fontlab studio and i am facing this weird
  problem.\r\nEverything was working fine until one fine moment when i am working
  on my Y the guides started behaving crazy. i can no longer right click on them and
  move them to my desired location.\r\n\r\nAnd also when i am trying to overlap some
  masks they are not getting overlapped properly i mean some weird white spaces are
  appearing(i have attached an image)\r\nPlease help me\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nMorpheus"

    will bring up a context menu. To move them use left-click and drag. Also you may
    have inadvertently locked your guides in the Editing Layers Panel.\r\n\r\n>And
    also when i am trying to overlap some masks they are not getting \r\n>overlapped
    properly i mean some weird white spaces are appearing.\r\nMake sure your contours
    are all going in the same direction. Mixing contour directions will give strange
    results when removing overlaps.\r\n\r\nM"

  body: Gotta be Postscript-flavoured, then. Unlike TrueType outlines, they tend to
    XOR each other out. Operate "Remove Overlap" on Y?

    persisted. I had to do it again :(\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nM"
