body: I am using Adobe Akzidenz Grotesque- light, roman, and bold, in a large format
  printed piece for a modern art museum. I have had a hard time pairing a serif face
  with the Akzidenz and wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts on this. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
  be using the serif face in well-leaded columns of body copy, with headlines, subheads
  and captions, etc. in Akzidenz. <BR> <BR>Usually I try to pair sans and serif faces
  of similar feel &#40;color within blocks of text, similar letter constructions,
  etc.&#41;- per Bringhurst&#39;s suggestions his Elements book.  <BR> <BR>Another
  option would be to lay the entire thing out in the sans serif face, but I want it
  to be super readable and classy at the same time. Not cold like some typical art
  museum publications.

  body: I&#39;d be inclined to try a Dutch/English oldstyle or a transitional face.
    Caslon, Janson, Baskerville, that sort of thing. Or a more modern design along
    the same lines -- some of the newer Dutch faces might work well. Scala, perhaps?

  body: Akzidenz Gtotesque has its origin in XIX century. <BR>What do you think of
    &#39;Modern Extended MT&#39; at its side?

  body: Janson looks really nice with it- especially the small caps contrasting the
    Akzidenz light. Have you ever seen an expert set with small caps, etc available
    for Baskerville? I wasn&#39;t sure if that exists...
