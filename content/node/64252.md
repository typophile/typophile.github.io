  body: "Thank you guys. Thomas, that is impressive. The \"s\" must surely be one
    of the most widely varied letters in history no?\r\n\r\nDavid \u2013 I thought
    the B\xE2tarde Italienne was sort of a precursor to the B\xE2tarde Coul\xE9e?
    It's less regularized, less connected, and note the absence of [closed] loops
    on ascenders, which seems rather common in the B\xE2tarde Coul\xE9e. But I might
    well be mistaken.\r\nAn \"S\" you say? Funky. So is that just a stylistic variant?
    \r\n(BTW, I don't have a reason to ask, other than curiosity \u2013 that just
    looks like a completely foreign character!)"

    nicer one I wanted to use, a special showing of the B\xE2tarde Coul\xE9e. Maybe
    I'll try again sometime. That spelling of ru\xEB with the diaeresis on e is normal
    at the time, but I don't know why."

  body: "What a peculiar piece of typography.\r\nIt has a lot of layout problems which
    seem to exist purely to show off contextual alternates.\r\nFor instance, the collision
    of the \"P\" in Paris with the ascender  above could have been avoided by setting
    \"de\" earlier in the line in \"normal\" type, or by using a swashless terminal
    \"e\" in \"entr\xE9e\". And yet a special form of \"f\" with no descender is used
    in \"fondeur\".\r\n\r\nBut as this card is targeted at printers, I would assume
    this is typographic humour, a brazen display of affectation--for those in the
    know. We got these sorts, and we're gonna use 'em!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Curious indeed! Thank you, James. \r\n\r\nIt's interesting that \"Des\" (in
    the address \u2013 hope I'm reading it right) ends in a \"script\" form of \"s\".
    So it looks like the \"rule\"(?) to use this special \"s\" at the end of words
    was easily broken? It sure looks like they enjoyed stylistic variation back then
    (also looking at the multitude of \"r\" shapes in there)."

    curiosity is a good reason.  if you like the subject see the book by Claude Mediavilla
    --  Histoire de la calligraphie fran\xE7aise (Paris\_: 2006); his website -- http://claudemediavilla.com/index.php?lang=fr
    \r\n\r\nif you have time  and want to understand the whole Financiere style read
    the book by John Salmon -- Renaissance and revolt: Essays in the intellectual
    and social history of early modern France.\r\n\r\n> So is that just a stylistic
    variant?\r\n\r\nwhy not; look for the work by Louis Senault, Claude A. Berey and
    you'll find the letter \"e\" that looks like \"c\"; \"R\"  that looks like \"v\"
    and more and more....\r\nBerey:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/berey_4293.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n>
    ... a completely foreign character!\r\n\r\nmaybe better to say/ask -- suitable
    for modern use? for example: \r\n1. Insular half-unical (northern England, Ireland)
    -- the letter \"g\" dosen't look like the modern \"g\"\r\n2. Beneventan style,
    8th century (centered on the Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino) --  you'll
    find the half \"r\" (see your sample), the letter \"e\" is tall; rising above
    the x-height and looks like modern ampersand.\r\n3. Luxeuil style, 7th century
    (the monastery at Luxeuil in France) -- the letter \"a\" looks like \"u\" (quite
    a lot of ligatures and maybe since of that we see the \"foreign character\")\r\n\r\n"
