  company. This company will put emphasis on website redesign for all the businesses
  out there with a crummy website (large market). The redesign will echo the feel
  of the establishment, and be tailored on a per client basis, like it should have
  been done the first time.  Designs will be clean, intuitive, and modern with a hand-crafted
  feel. NuArtisan will also handle identity, print media, and photography.\r\n\r\nWe
  went with the color scheme of black, white, and red as a throwback to original print
  medium colors, but based on a modern typeface that spans eras of type.\r\n\r\nLet
  me know what you think of our concept.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nuartisan.net\"
  target=\"_blank\">Austin Web Design</a>\r\n\r\n(Aside from a concept, the logo is
  the only other item that has been 'fleshed out' so far)\r\n\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    but it may not be appropriate.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm more interested in is: is it really
    possible to make business of clients that have crappy websites since they don't
    want to spend money on something they don't see any real potential and are present
    in the area just because it's trendy.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of the same business
    model few years ago but came up with the conclusion there may be some money but
    probably much more nerves and not enough persistent income.\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: "Thanks for the comment.\r\n\r\nI hear what you're saying about the market
    potentially not being there, but it's worth a shot, and if it doesn't work out,
    there is very little out-of-pocket cash on my end, so we thought we'd give it
    a try.  I also have a sales superstar as my other half of this team. \r\n\r\nBut,
    we'll see how it goes. \r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: "Don't get me wrong. I didn't want to persuade you in the opposite direction.
    My opinion is just that you can't really work for a long time on low budget small
    projects that don't give enough satisfaction. Especially because client's won't
    see it as something they actually REALLY need. Web medium didn't serve them so
    far, why would it now?\r\n\r\nAnyway. I think I missed something. If you have
    a good salesman, he/she'll be able to get you at least medium size projects that
    you can benefit from. That's why you'll probably make it. Which is good. So go
    for it and prove me wrong. ;)\r\n\r\nOtherwise: is there any other variation of
    the logo as well?\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
