  a copy, removing its overlaps, and checking for a difference in anchor points between
  the copy and the original. I make my copy like this:\r\n\r\ncopy = glyph.copy()\r\n\r\nBut
  when I try to remove overlaps in the copy:\r\n\r\ncopy.removeOverlap()\r\n\r\nFontlab
  give this error:\r\n\r\nAttributeError: 'RGlyph' object has no attribute 'removeOverlap'\r\n\r\nWhat
  am I doing wrong?\r\n"

  body: "As far as I can see you are trying to apply a FontLab-specific method (\u2018removeOverlap()\u2019)
    on a glyph object that is not in FontLab itself. The copy() constructor gives
    you an RF Glyph object but as long as it doesn\u2019t have a place in your FontLab
    file you cannot apply FontLab-specific methods. See: [[http://robofab.org/objects/glyph.html]]\r\n\r\nUse
    f['some_glyph_name'].appendGlyph(copy) to create a copy of the glyph in your FontLab
    file. Then you can remove the overlap and start comparing coordinates.\r\n\r\nHTH."
