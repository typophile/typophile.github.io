    on that site seem to be so. (which is appropriate to the quality of work they
    seem to state they do).\r\n\r\nhowever there are tons of script fonts out there
    to choose from. just a couple of examples...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/lily-wang/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/fragrance/"

  body: There are 2 different scripts on this wedding invitation. "your response is
    requested by"/"dress to impress" is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bickham-script-mm|Bickham
    Script]] (using some [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bickham-script-mm/regular/glyphs.html|stylistic
    alternates]]). Unfortunately, that's a different story for "Angela and Justin"
    which is clearly stated "[[http://www.bespokepress.com.au/invitation/angela-and-justin|custom
    hand lettering with personalised monogram]]". You may have a look to the work
    of [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Emily_Lime/|Emily Lime]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Laura_Worthington/|Laura
    Worthingthon]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Magpie_Paper_Works/|Jessica McCarty]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Tart_Workshop/|Crystal Kluge]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Corradine_Fonts/|Manuel
    Corradine]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Sudtipos/|Alejandro Paul]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Li%C3%A1n_Types/|Maximiliano
    Sproviero]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Typesenses/|Sabrina Lopez]].
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emily-lime/carolyna|Carolyna]] could be, for instance,
    an excellent substitute.
