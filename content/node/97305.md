  body: I am deeply saddened by this loss. Last talked to him on the phone a few months
    ago. He was a memorable and irascible fellow, passionate about things that mattered
    to him and ought to matter to everyone. Damn.

  body: 'This news was a sad way to start the day. Bill and I didn''t always agree,
    but I admired his metaphorical mind: his ability to make sense of one thing through
    the prism of another, e.g. how his experience tracking animals informed his thoughts
    on reading. His <a href="http://www.billhillsite.com/osprey.doc"><em>Osprey</em>
    paper [MS Word Doc link]</a> is now in parts an historical document, as one would
    expect from something last updated in 1999, but I re-read some of it today and
    still found it interesting an insightful. I can''t think of a more fitting tribute
    to Bill than to encourage everyone to spend some time today lost in ''ludic reading''.'

  body: "I picked up the news via Berkson and Phinney on Facebook.\r\nI spent a lot
    of time emailing with Bill. Chewing the fat about this and that. (For some reason,
    I remember a  bad joke - Bill mentioned running into Graham Nash on the plane
    to Hawaii and that, coincidentally, Nash had a house near Bill's on Kauai. I emailed
    Bill back asking if he knew whether it was a very, very fine house.)  It's ok
    to start singing.... go with it.\r\n\r\nTo re-state what Thomas said on Facebook
    - I knew him, I liked him.\r\n\r\nHe was a mentor and teacher to me in the field
    of fonts, typography, and readability. I owed him one.\r\n\r\nThere's a song that
    was written by a guy named Nick Gravenites called Buried Alive In The Blues.\r\nJanis
    Joplin was scheduled to record the vocals for it the day AFTER she overdosed.
    (They included the song on the record \"Pearl\" as an instrumental.)\r\n\r\nBill
    was in super physical condition and had just announced a new \"readability\" related
    project that he had gotten involved with on his blog.\r\n\r\nThe unexpectedness
    of it....."

  body: On the subject of jokes, it was from Bill that I heard 'What do you call two
    type designers in a room together? ... An argument.' Which would serve quite well
    as a motto for Typophile.

  body: 'This very sad... I asked Bill what should I do next.. I think I should design
    a decent font editor, but he said we have thousands of SDEs why don''t you design
    a typeface the way we did Tahoma... ironically it is used in the geek wire article.
    Very sad. Think I''ll make a very hot Indian Curry in honour of bill. '
