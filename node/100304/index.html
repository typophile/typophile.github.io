  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi There, 

I've got a brief to make a small book/booklet in the style of a "Dockers Workbook" celebrating one man (union leader Walt Cunningham's) life on the docks of Hull between 1950's-1980's. 

i have been looking everywhere for a nice clear legible serif typeface to  use for my body copy , i found one that i loved FF Scala Pro Regular http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_scala_pro/ it works n perfectly with the ethos of my type having been use in books depicting  democratic revolutions/movements and in Museum booklets.The elegance of this typeface is exactly what i need but don't have the  € 299.00  to purchase it on a student's income. 

I was wondering if anyone had any alternatives to FF Scala with a more friendly price tag. or any other typeface what would communicate perfectly the struggles of a working class movement which have been in mostly forgotten. 

Thanks for any response

		<div class="commentbody">Are you sure FF Scala fits the "working class" ethos? I guess it does have some such attributes, but it also seems a bit too mannered to me here (look at that "a" for one thing). Something like Bookman (even though I personally don't like the way it looks) or Cheltenham (which I do like) might be better. Or do you think slabby serifs are helpful here?

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, yeah just looked up Cheltenham and love it. The only reason i thought FF Scala was a good decision was because of it's previous uses seem to work pretty well in displaying political and democratic issues.

Thanks again

		<div class="commentbody">Matt, FF Scala has been used for many subjects - I have seen art and recipes books set in it - and it isn't a "democratic" or political typeface per se (*).

If you're stuck with the idea of finding a typeface related to the subject of your book, or to a particular cultural climate (the union struggles in Hull in post II world war Britain), why don't you look, for example, for a book typeface used in that period in your country?

You could try to have a look at the classic Monotype catalogue set by Stanley Morison or at the Penguin social essays published in 50/60/70's.

Eric Gill's work has a strong, unorthodox connection to socialist ideas in XX century Britain: perhaps you could try to have a look at his Aries, Golden Cockerel or Johanna serif types.

Or, more simply, try to look for a typeface from Britain's typographic heritage - Baskerville and Miller comes to mind.

Hope this helps.

(*) Martin Majoor on the origins of Scala: "FF Scala is named after the Teatro alla Scala (1776–78) in Milan. There were two reasons for this name: FF Scala was made especially for a concert hall, the Vredenburg in Utrecht, and the design has it roots in around the time Teatro alla Scala was built, the mid-eighteenth century".</div>

That's an oddly specific requirement for a typeface, is it not? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for all the feedback i have looked into Johanna. 
I have looked into the Monotype catalogue previously and they did help.
I wanted to stay clear of Baskerville due to history of being created for a upper class market and it's like to Cambridge University and it's connotations of dignity and it's common use to day with university studies. Not to say i don't like Baskerville (great typeface) but just feel as if would be slightly hypocritical to the narrative.

I have a meeting with a manger at GF Smith's (paper) tomorrow morning and his father owned the print company that printed the handbook's and all the forms for the dockers so that could really be a positive move forward.

Thanks again for all the help,

Really appreciated </div>
