body: "Monotype Imaging today announced that more than 100 fonts are now available
  from its Monotype, Linotype and ITC typeface foundries. The designs range from enhancements
  of timeless classics to new space-saving offerings. The fonts are available online
  at Fonts.com, Linotype.com, ITCFonts.com and Faces.co.uk. \r\n\r\nNew to the Monotype
  Library\r\nThe Slate\u2122 Condensed family by Rod MacDonald leads a selection of
  releases from the Monotype foundry. Elegant yet functional, the fonts add six space-savings
  designs to the original Slate family. Also new to the Monotype Library is the Givens
  Antiqua\u2122 family. Drawn by George Ryan of Monotype Imaging and named in honor
  of Robert M. Givens, Monotype Imaging\u2019s first president and chief executive
  officer and current chairman of the board, the Givens Antiqua design employs a generous
  x-height and open proportions to promote readability. The new Monotype typefaces
  follow the April announcement of the Soho\xAE Gothic family, the latest offering
  by Monotype Imaging\u2019s Sebastian Lester, which extends his 40-font Soho collection
  released last year. \r\n\r\nNew to the Linotype Library\r\nDesigned by Akira Kobayashi,
  type director at Linotype, the Eurostile\xAE Next family is the newest of five typeface
  families added to the Linotype Library. Part of the Linotype Platinum\u2122 Collection,
  Eurostile Next is an enhanced and expanded version of the widely used Eurostile
  typeface family. Like the original, Eurostile Next uses open, squared letterforms
  to create a modern aesthetic. The Cosmiqua\u2122 family, also from Kobayashi, exudes
  a lively, youthful feel inspired by advertising from the 1950s. The design includes
  five weights, each with an italic counterpart.\r\n\r\nThe Satero\u2122 family, created
  by designer Werner Schneider, is a versatile type system that contains complementary
  sans serif and serif variations. Designed with newspaper and magazine use in mind,
  the Satero family offers high legibility and slightly condensed proportions to help
  maximize space limitations. \r\n\r\nCalligrapher Gaynor Goffe brings to the Linotype
  Library the Hamada\u2122 typeface, a script design that captures the feeling of
  ink on paper. The font offers many alternate characters and a series of ligatures
  and swashes for seemingly limitless combinations.\r\n\r\nAlso new to the Linotype
  Library is the Frutiger\xAE Arabic family, which carries over the friendly, yet
  professional demeanor of the original Frutiger design to the Arabic alphabet. Created
  by Linotype designer Nadine Chahine, with the approval of Adrian Frutiger, who designed
  the Frutiger typeface in the 1970s, the Frutiger Arabic family is intended for use
  in a variety of applications, form signage to corporate design.\r\n\r\nChahine,
  Kobayashi and Frutiger are also credited with other typefaces announced this year,
  including the Frutiger Serif family, designed by Kobayashi and Frutiger, and the
  Palatino\xAE Arabic design, created by Chahine and Hermann Zapf, who designed the
  original Palatino typeface more than 50 years ago. The Palatino Arabic typeface
  was honored for design excellence at the TDC2 2008 design competition held by the
  Type Directors Club of New York City.\r\n\r\nNew to the ITC Library\r\nThe ITC Franklin\u2122
  family, which evolved from the widely used ITC Franklin Gothic\u2122 design, is
  the latest release from International Typeface Corporation, a Monotype Imaging Inc.
  company. Designer David Berlow created the ITC Franklin version specifically for
  use at display sizes. ITC also released OpenType\xAE Pro versions of the popular
  ITC Stone\xAE and ITC Bodoni\u2122 families. OpenType fonts, which operate on both
  Macintosh\xAE and Microsoft\xAE Windows\xAE platforms, allow type designers to create
  large character sets within fonts \u2013 up to 65,000 characters \u2013 well beyond
  the 256 characters supported by PostScript\xAE Type 1 or TrueType\xAE fonts. Instead
  of creating multiple fonts, a typeface designer can build a single OpenType font
  that provides access to characters that would have previously required switching
  between fonts. The ITC Stone Pro collection includes the ITC Stone Serif Pro, ITC
  Stone Sans Pro, ITC Stone Informal Pro and ITC Stone Humanist Pro families. Each
  shares an underlying structure that allows the designs to coexist harmoniously.
  The ITC Bodoni family is intended to serve as a faithful rendition of Giambattista
  Bodoni\u2019s most revered typeface design. As OpenType Pro families, the ITC Stone
  Pro and ITC Bodoni Pro offerings provide expanded character sets to support most
  Central European and many Eastern European languages.\r\n\r\nThe ITC Mattia\u2122
  design from designer Giuseppe Errico is a distinctive handwriting font, with its
  scrawled letterforms that produce a tense, nervous tone. The ITC Santangeli\u2122
  face, also from Errico, is based on an 18th century manuscript by Italian writer,
  Benedetto Santangeli. The design includes alternate characters and ink splotches
  to enable a realistic reproduction of antique lettering.\r\n\r\n"
