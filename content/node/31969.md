body: "Hello dear Typophiles\r\nKulby is a humanist sans I'm currently working on.
  It's purpose is to be legible at small sizes, yet still be harmonic and not disturbing
  at larger sizes. Therefore I have avoided ink-traps and other more or less extreme
  compensations for setting small.\r\n\r\nIt's is my first attempt at making a 'real'
  typeface, but please give it all you got, I want it to become good ;-)\r\n\r\nThe
  two things that are the most difficult for me to spot now after working with it,
  are the widths of the characters and the character colour (stroke weight).\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks\r\nClaus Eggers S\xF8rensen"

  body: The "g" is distracting to me. There is a fine line between doing something
    different or unique, and doing something that will be functional. It is also be
    a matter of preference, but it sounds like you want to do something that will
    be readable for lenths of text. If so, I would reconsider that glyph. Overall
    the face seems to be very well drawn...

    first, but makes a nice 'signature'... rian hughes often uses the lower case g
    in a similar way...\r\n\r\nit might just be the pdf, but it all seems a little
    'heavy' for 'medium'... are you planning other weights?"

  body: "Thank you all for you comments.\r\n\r\nAlessandro: Out of key? I don't understand.
    You say the diacritics should be stronger and bigger and I can see what you mean
    there. Wider 't', yes, but a more heavy 'X' - really? Would others care to comment
    on that?\r\n\r\nChris: The shape of the 'g' is part due to my danish heritage,
    where that shape has become somewhat of a Danish trait in typedesign, and partly
    because the decender lenght is so short that any other shape is hard to squeese
    in - but I'll try again :-)\r\n\r\nBrett: Thanks. Perhaps it IS too fat to be
    called medium, I will compare to others... And yes I'm planning to do a super-family
    out of it, but I'm taking one step at a time, even though I have started a black
    weight just to see what happens."

  body: "No, \"too light too small\" was referred to the diacritic marks only\u2014\u2014I
    might be wrong but from what I remember (sorry about the time) the 't' seems short
    and the 'X' having strange diagonals."

  body: "Kulby is very nice--well-balanced and legible.  I like the g and think it
    fits in well with the other characters, but to me it creates an impression that
    the bottom stroke has been cut off (as if the line below is overwriting the g).\r\n\r\nI
    have two suggestions:  First, the top right stroke of the S and s seem to be pointing
    too much downward.  Second, there appears to be an optical illusion in the \"notch\"
    of the u: because of the curved stroke, the point B seems to be to the left of
    the point A.  This can also be seen in the d and a.  It seems to be less prevalent
    in the n,m,p,etc---maybe because the curved stroke is just starting there and
    doesn't have as much \"motion\"?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kulby_u_6398.png]"

  body: "I'm liking it. \r\nI also noticed the optical shift in points on the 'u'
    (and other similar glyphs), as sgh describes. But this can easily be fixed, by
    making it optically aligned.\r\nI like the 'g', but I can also imagine that for
    some people it might be distracting. You could always create two g's, as an alternate
    or something. Or just ignore it. ;)\r\nThe horizontal join of the 'k' works well,
    but I usually like that a lot. Reminiscent of Smijers, which is a good thing.\r\nI
    am not really bothered by the 'X'. The 'z' might be a bit wide, but that is probably
    a matter of taste."

  body: I love the g. I believe someone reading copy set in the face would probably
    get used to the g almost immediately. What I find distracting are the wide notches;
    that is to say, I think the stem-ends are too strongly tapered.

  body: "Hi there\r\nI have made some modifications to the face per your comments.
    S, s, C and c have been opened up slightly. The way the curve meets the stem in
    n and related characters have been optically corrected. And finally the diacritics
    have been beefed up considerably. There is still a problem in getting room for
    the lower comma-accents, and I not quite sure what to do there. The X have been
    changed, and the g is now a two storey shape, let me know what you think about
    that one compared to the previous shape."

    where I saw such a 'g' before, in an article somewhere; The typeface for the Danish
    Railway, at some point anyway. Or still today, I don't know.\r\n\r\nNice to see
    that it's obviously indeed a Danish trait, and that you implemented it in your
    typeface. I like it.\r\nThe double-story is also fine, but I think then you should
    at least put in both versions. :)"

  body: Please don't change the g. I like the face very much, and the the g is quite
    likely my favorite character in the font. Yes, it's distinctive and stands out
    a bit, but if necessary (and possible), change some of the other decenders to
    better match the g. And I'm not even sure that's needed &#8212; when seen together
    the short, abreviated decenders work quite well together, I think.
