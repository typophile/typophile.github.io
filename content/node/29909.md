      the one that came to mind. I looked thruogh an old catalog of theirs too, convinced
      I have seen this, but no.\r\n\r\nSo far nothing else too close---any other folks
      have a lead?\r\nthanks"

  body: "You know I never gave much status to those CSA fonts, because none of them
    seemed original. Whether or not it's original, Ignacio, you pulled that rabbit
    out of a hat. Great ID work!\r\n\r\n(Looking in some of the old Photo-Lettering
    catalogs from 1960, this is very close to their 'Animated Gothics' category, with
    typefaces by Ed Benguiat and Anthony Violino, among others. I suspect 'Melvern'
    may have had it's inspiration, if not it's actual letterforms in one of these.)\r\n\r\n

  body: Those fonts are derived from Charles S. Anderson's massive collection of advertising
    and ephemera. So some are based on lettering, but it's likely that some were originally
    PL fonts too.

    the typophile system? I get so much spam that I sometimes throw out real mail.
    Would you re-send again? (if you put 'ID' or 'font' in the title it will be highlighted).
