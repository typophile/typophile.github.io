body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI am writing an experimental chat application, focused
  on a clean user interface. It draws several ideas from various sources, but is mostly
  inspired by the <a href=\"http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/\">Gargoyle</a> Interactive
  Fiction player:\r\n\r\n<cite>Gargoyle cares about typography! In this computer age
  of typographical poverty, where horrible fonts, dazzling colors, and inadequate
  white space is God, Gargoyle dares to rebel!</cite>\r\n\r\nAlthough I like Gargoyle's
  default font, Bitstream Charter, I found its Unicode coverage severely lacking (even
  in the commercial Pro version). For instance, it does not support cyrillics, or
  some eastern-european characters such as \u015F/\u0163.\r\n\r\nHere is what I have
  so far:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0000038A_6330.png]\r\n(also note
  how the base of the \"fi\" ligature is blurred)\r\n\r\nThus, I ask: which font could
  I use with better Unicode coverage that isn't too different from Charter, or perhaps
  better befitting my application in your opinion?\r\n\r\nEdit: never mind, I just
  used Georgia..."

    you asked about something similar to Charter with better glyph coverage, including
    cyrillic, it seemed like you might be asking specifically for [[http://scripts.sil.org/CharisSILfont|Charis
