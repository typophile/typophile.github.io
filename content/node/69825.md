  and discover that the font is \"Plantin\" \"Identity-H encoding\" (what does it
  mean ?)\r\nI have this font but the visual aspect is not the same ! the original
  is smooth seems to be more condensed character. Do you know how I could have the
  same visual aspect ? is it the encoding that produce this effect ? or is it another
  font ?\r\n\r\nI ish you could help me...\r\n\r\nhere is the original pdf (the font
  in which I'm interested is the text corpus)\r\nhttp://www.analog.com/library/analogdialogue/archives/38-06/capacitive_loading.pdf\r\n\r\nhere

  body: "I did a Google search on the term <a href=\"http://www.google.com/#hl=en&source=hp&q=Identity-H+encoding&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&fp=4f910945c1ee36d4\">\"Identity-H
    encoding\"</a>, and basically it seems to mean double byte font encoding, which
    is used for extended character sets. It's not obvious to me why that should affect
    the way the font is displayed. Maybe one of our Adobe experts can help you.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "My amateur's guess is that your version of Plantin is not the same as they
    used. The way they are shown in the Properties>Fonts window is not the same. Yours
    is PS1, I think, and theirs is [F], whatever that is. Either a different font
    format, or a different version of Plantin than the one you used.  \r\n\r\nMaybe
    a PDF expert will help us out.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I have no idea about that "Identity-H encoding". On the other hand, the original
    pdf was produced with InDesign that allows [[squoosh]]ing text i.e. applying a
    fixed factor on the width of each character in the text to make it more condensed.
    I think that is what was done to get those more condensed characters in the original
    text.
