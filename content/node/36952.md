  body: I guess Dr. Livingstone never watched his television set sideways. He would
    have noticed that both eyes see differently right then and there, and when the
    two separate images come together -- voila one good sighting.

  body: "They read differently, I would imagine.\r\nBut to exploit that for reading
    research, subjects who were born with only one working eye would be required --
    how rare are they?\r\nA significant number of people lose the sight of one eye
    and continue to read (and even make typefaces, in the case of Fred Goudy), but
    they have learned to read with both eyes, complicating theory."
