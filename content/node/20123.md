  so familiar, and yet...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/norfolkcoast_large_4314.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/The_Stranglers-The_Collection_1977-1982_3891.jpg]\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nShelagh"

    Brody</a>, condensed about 33%, and customized slightly (lowercase g).

    are different."

  body: "Looks like lettering to me. The two s's, t's and e's have a slight difference
    in stroke modulation, I don't think they're identical.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Definitely
    lettering, here's a link to a bigger <a href=\"http://www.stranglers.net/pontins1.jpg\">image.</a> "

  body: It reminds me of the fonts at Dinc Type/Diane DiPiazza made. She closed up
    shop on the fonts, and I don't know of any download sites.

  body: I have a predigital showing of that as Harper Script. I've never seen a digital
    (font) version. The closest I know of in a font would be <a href="http://fontsfordesign.com/preview.html"
    target="_blank">Keystrokes'</a> <a href="http://fontsfordesign.com/previews/hemlock.html"
    target="_blank">Hemlock Script</a> - which would require a bit of condensing and
    artificial bolding.

    Tim, the link to \"bigger image\" doesn't seem to be included in your last post...I'd
    be interested to see it!\r\nShelagh"

    \ like to think they were echoing the block-set, type heavy, Grand Ol' Opry-style
    concert posters from days of yore, but highly unlikely. Surely hasn't any of their
    charm...\r\n\r\nShelagh"

  body: ps ...that is, without actually using any block type, of course...just that
    crude sort of un-nuanced, text-heavy treatment of old concert posters, I was referring
    too...
