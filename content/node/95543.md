  body: FASHIONS is definitely [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller-banner/|Miller
    Banner]] (Light). I have some doubts on "THE LUGGAGE TAG" though. Looks like it
    is also Miller Banner but not quite exactly (could be my eyes, the italic or it
    has been slightly manipulated...). Serifs look more curvy and elongated than Miller
    Banner. There's also how the /G spur connects... That could also be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/benton-modern-display/|Benton
    Modern Display]].
