  body: Since young minds don't have the experience of viewing and cataloging various
    typefaces and their nuances in their hard drive (brain), I would keep it simple,
    i.e., Avante Garde, News Gothic, Futura; faces that can be read easily and quickly.
    I would also stay away from extended or condensed, as well.

  body: "Is it concentrated voluminous copy or just spotty text along with illustrations?\r\n\r\nIf
    it is not long and tedious I designed Peanut for kids about two years ago and
    I have seen it used in a number of books for first thru fourth grades.\r\n\r\nI
    think it is fun, open, young; and I tried to keep within the confines of the traditional
    Roman.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/peanut_4135.png]\r\n\r\nIf this
    is too juvenile then maybe something like Palatino Sans.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    long, but thanks for showing me the Peanut. May come in handy on the long term.
