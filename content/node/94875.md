  I'm working on at the moment. I have hit a wall and I'm no longer sure I'm on the
  right track. Hang it to dry please! Need some perspective here :)\r\nHave a look
  here http://www.behance.net/gallery/PRECISION-feedback-seeking-%29/4577977\r\n\r\nAbout
  me, as is rude not to introduce myself, I'm a graphic designer living and working
  in London UK but I'm from Madrid. I work in the fashion industry at the moment and
  to keep the juices flowing I get to do some side projects in my spare time. \r\n\r\nAny
  comments welcome and much appreciated!"

    couple of thoughts -\r\nI find that the corner cuts look accidental - as if someone
    accidentally clipped the word while doing some cutting and pasting. It leaves
    just the opposite impression of 'Precision'.\r\n\r\nThe wording, \"Train with
    purpose\" needs better spacing (\"Train\" is too close to \"with\" when compared
    to the spacing between \"with\" and \"purpose\", but that's a minor point, because
    the entire phrase makes absolutely no sense to me. I THINK it means \"Training
    With a Purpose\"; but I've never heard of training WITHOUT a purpose - have you?.
    \ Does the PT up in the corner have any connection with the rest of the logo,
    or have any hidden significance?\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hey Herb, thanks a lot for your comments. And for the direct link! \r\n\r\nI'm
      finding it really difficult to convey \"Precision\" without falling into the
      cliches mentioned above (stopwatch and the like). I guess it was a way of adding
      a bit of up-and-forward movement without having to go for the leaning trick,
      not that I didn't tried, it just looked lame.\r\n\r\nTrain with purpose is the
      name of the website so I'm stuck with it (maybe the client is completely wrong
      in here but unfortunately I cannot change this although I can give my opinion).
      Although I think that it does make sense (yep, there's people that 'train' without
      any kind of purpose and just hang out at gyms...at least mine!)I see your point
      and it might not be the right wording for the message they want to convey. \r\n-
      Great advice on the spacing by the way...I'll be changing that!\r\n\r\nThe PT
      thingy came with the brief, Personal Training...but you're right, it's not needed!\r\n\r\nThanks
      very much again!!"

      body: I only saw the page I linked to - not the one that Hrant linked to, and
        never saw the description - in context, such as over a gym doorway or in a
        display advertisement, the PT and "Train With Purpose" make a lot more sense,
        although PT could as easily stand for Physical Therapy, which is the first
        thing that came to mind (an age-related connection, no doubt!)

        body: "<cite>Frankly it sounds like you might be too concerned with appearing
          sophisticated to other designers, at the expense of finding a logo that
          will actually bring customers to your client... I say this because I see
          it happen all the time - but hopefully I'm wrong in this case.</cite>\r\n\r\n@hhp\r\nOuch!
          That hurt!!! :-) ! I don't care much about being or appearing sophisticated
          to others designers or not,  but if that was the case it's something unconscious.
          \r\nWhat I dislike about the stopwatch is giving more importance to the
          goal than to the process that leads you to the goal, something my client
          is all about. I will probably give it a go though, just to play with the
          idea as I discarded it from the beginning and may be i shouldn't have, \"try
          everything\" is a good way to go. And I will try that typeface you recommend
          although I don't really like it, but again \"try everything, there's nothing
          to lose!\"\r\nWhat I like about the font is that is solid, the narrowness,
          the fact that is constructed with very straight strokes appearing quite
          strict but softened with nice round angles. It has quite a presence without
          being too heavy on the eye. Hope this makes a bit of sense :)\r\n\r\n@HVB\r\nI
          see..he he he! In many ways exercise is physical therapy, isn't it? \r\nMy
          client is mostly concerned about the corners being interpreted as \"cutting
          corners\" which as a Spaniard is an expression I haven't ingrained in my
          brain so it doesn't pop as that but I understand his view and wanted to
          have more english speakers' opinions. \r\n@JamesM\r\nI agree that a stopwatch
          is not as much about precision as it is about goals and the client is more
          keen in emphasizing the journey opposed to the destination if that makes
          sense. That's why i didn't play with that idea although it obviously came
          to mind. \r\nI sketched the target and also showed a blueprint-like logo
          and another one built on a grid. All of them rejected. This one was chosen
          and that's where I get stuck as there isn't a very solid idea or concept
          behind it. I will upload my sketches maybe there is a way of developing
          one of them further and I can propose something else. \r\nI'll have a look
          at the tagline, I printed it with 1cm height for the whole thing and it
          was readable, I'll doublecheck that again.\r\n\r\nThanks to all of you for
          your very useful ideas & comments, all taken onboard. I have a few things
          to try now so I don't feel as stuck. Please keep commenting!\r\nIrene\r\n\r\n"

    for the nice narrowness, it doesn't seem to be saying \"precision\", or \"sports\",

    works: try slanting the letterforms; but keep them narrow, and rigid.\r\n\r\nYou
    could also try replacing the \"E\" with ruler marks (which we've actually seen
    done on Typophile) or the \"O\" with [something that evokes] a stopwatch.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing that might work is giving this a bitmapfont (or seven-segment) flavor (maybe
    just for the \"PT\", or the \"E\" or \"O\") which would evoke the electronic equipment

    more appropriate graphic to me would be a target. Yes it's a cliche, but perhaps

    looks like a one, although that's more of a destination thing and not a journey
    thing. I also like the colon approach, especially since it would lend itself very
    well to animation (in case you might ever go there) but it's not enough of an
    \"I\"... Maybe make the dots much taller (or cut dots out of an \"I\"). I think
    the \"Oh\" with the cross could work, but might be much better with a totally
    circular \"Oh\". I like the one with the middle \"I\" slanted, because besides
    implying motion it also makes it look like a formula, like something that needs
    to be balanced for optimal performance.\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm not so sure about your
    \"S\" - it might need more polish to make the spine look right. And you might
    check out the \"S\" in Pill Gothic*, at least for inspiration.\r\n\r\n* http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/betatype/pill-gothic/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
