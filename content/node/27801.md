body: "I used to like MS Word several years ago (1980s or so) before it became a full
  featured behemoth carnivore (This happened somewhere after version 5.5 for the Mac).
  Now I just tolerate it because it is ubiquitous and I must.  It took some poking
  around to find a way to turn on kerning but I finally managed to do it.\r\nMy next
  dilemma is finding out how to turn on ligatures.  Is it even possible? Surely a
  word processing program pays more attention to all the things needed to set words
  more than all the things needed to insert clip art of the worst degree? The tacky
  clip art thing is quite easy to find but the kerning thing eludes my best detective
  efforts. Do I need Inspector Clouseau or Adrian Monk?\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/peter_sellers_3918.jpg]"

  body: "ChrisL,\r\ncan you give me an example of a font/application combination where
    OpenType ligatures actually works and produces correct output? After my last posting
    I tried it with Indesign CS and Times Italic, Zapfino and Adobe Jenson Pro. Results
    in German language are not conform to the rule I explained in the last post. Indesign
    still makes Au-\uFB02\xF6sung and au-f\uFB01nden, even with an automatic ffi-ligature
    if there's one available. I tried the same using TextEdit and the standard OpenType
    treatment of OS X 10.3.9, with similar results.\r\nThe only workaround seems either
    to use a discretionary hyphen where the words join (this only seems to work while
    writing the text and before the au<strong>f-f-i</strong>nden is substituted with
    a ffi-ligature). Both applications give up their wrong ligatures if you kern e.g.
    at <em>auf|\uFB01nden</em>. \r\nAny suggestions? \r\nSo the \"Wordly mysteries\"
    do not only apply to <em>the big MStery</em> called W\xF6rd. \r\nMy way would
    be to use a typesetting system that relies on dictionaries and is really capable
    of handling ligatures. I've had good experiences with LaTeX in that respect. \r\nAnd
    never trust the software (may it be a layout software or an OpenType font) you're
    using, it is always only as good as its developers knew what they were doing\u2026\r\nThe
    alternative would be (a) to stop using ligatures at least in the languages that
    \"the software\" does not know the rules of, (b) use fonts where \uFB02, \uFB01
    etc. look just the same as fl, fi (that is the case with many standard sanserifs,
    see \r\n<code>span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"</code> =)"

  body: "Chris, \r\ntrue, true. I am sure that this is possible with OpenType, only
    it is hard to have all the different norms of various cultures and languages encorporated
    in one piece of software. That is because most type designers are not linguists
    (of course, vice versa most linguists also won't care about whether their texts
    have correct ligatures as long as it looks ok and someone has made a nice layout
    for it). \r\nRegarding the above example: I am quite sure that there are no german
    words that begin with \"auf\" followed by \"fi/fl\" and still need a ffi/ffl lig.
    Same goes for most of the words that start with the prefix auf- (and therefore
    should not have a \uFB01 or \uFB02 lig in this place), but although I admit that
    I had to think a little: there are instances in German where au may be followed
    by a \uFB01 or \uFB02 lig. All the words that start with \uFB01/\uFB02 and have
    a prefix auf- should have a \uFB01/\uFB02, but not a ffi/ffl lig. \r\nDoes some
    major foundry look for a consultant in german typography norms? ;)"
