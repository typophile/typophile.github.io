body: "I admit I don't really have a favorite designer, and since this assignment
  is to find a piece by your favorite designer and tell what's so special about him/her
  and their work, I started looking up different designers online and looking at some
  of their work. I came across the designer Banksy, a British street artist. He was
  one of the first designers I looked at, and the one that my mind kept going back
  to. I find his work to be very interesting, as much of it is done on sides of buildings.
  On his website, there's even some things that he did in New Orleans, which I think
  is what really made him stand out even more. My favorite works of art on the website
  are the ones of the rats on the sides of the buildings. They're really cute and
  I think the \"I love NY\" rat best depicts pet rats because they really are very
  sweet, loving, and intelligent animals. The \"I love NY\" rat just reminds me of
  my former pet rats, especially my first one, with a sweet, innocent, and playful
  look to it. I think Banksy's work is great and pretty original.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.banksy.co.uk/\r\n"

    are some Banksy experts here, can anyone confirm if this is original, or a rip-off?\r\nhttp://sehsucht.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/affe.jpg\r\nSpotted
    in Zurich. I'm not sure he actually did some work there; it also looks kind of
    badly executed, but it's definitely a Banksy motif (\"laugh now, but one day we'll
    be in charge\")."
