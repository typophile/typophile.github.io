  Type Club mission is to promote Typography. The formation of the Club is to encourage
  quality and innovation among practitioners. There are many people and businesses
  involved with type, the aim is to give all these different sources a voice and a
  meeting point. The Club holds regular meeting/events in Toronto and is a forum for
  discussion.\r\n\r\nMembers include typeface designers, teachers, graphic designers,
  art directors, printers, etc. Typography can be specialized, that is the problem;
  we all have particular interests. The Club aims to bring us all together.\r\n\r\nMembership
  is available to anyone interested in typography.\r\n\r\nwww.typeclub.com"
