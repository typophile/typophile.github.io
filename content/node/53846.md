    during our first year at the academy with our professor Philipp Stamm. We worked
    with the words of a quote by Kurt Schwitters taken from his script \xABDie neue
    Gestaltung in der Typografie\xBB (loose translation: \xABThe New Design in Typography\xBB)
    he did in 1930. It's:\r\n\r\n<cite>\xABGestaltung ist Einheit aus Vielheit, durch
    Auswahl, Begrenzung, Gliederung, Rhythmus, durch ruhendes oder gerichtet bewegtes
    Gleichgewicht, durch System.\xBB</cite>\r\n\r\nI would translate it this way:\r\n<cite>\xABDesign
    is unity out of multiplicity, by selection, limitation, formation, rhythm, via
    static or directedly moved balance, via a system.\xBB</cite>\r\n\r\nHe also writes
    <cite>\xABDie neue Typografie erfasst alles durch Gestaltung.\xBB</cite> what
    means <cite>\xABThe new typography compasses anything through design\xBB</cite>
    \u2013 just to link the two terms in this context."

  body: "\"Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction
    in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer,
    was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to
    take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to
    do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount
    of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography
    great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science
    can't capture, and I found it fascinating.\r\n\r\nNone of this had even a hope
    of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing
    the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into
    the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped
    in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces
    or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely
    that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would
    have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might
    not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to
    connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very
    clear looking backwards ten years later.\""

  body: "And the following, which is long for a quote, but is a vital idea in design,
    whether you agree or disagree with Warde's conclusions. There are a few good quotes
    in there you could pull out:\r\n\r\n\"Imagine that you have before you a flagon
    of wine. You may choose your own favorite vintage for this imaginary demonstration,
    so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in colour. You have two goblets before
    you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns. The other is
    of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent. Pour and drink;
    and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a
    connoisseur of wine. For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other,
    you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have
    cost thousands of pounds; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the
    amateurs of fine vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything about
    it is calculated to reveal rather than to hide the beautiful thing which it was
    meant to contain.\r\n\r\n\"Bear with me in this long-winded and fragrant metaphor;
    for you will find that almost all the virtues of the perfect wine-glass have a
    parallel in typography. There is the long, thin stem that obviates fingerprints
    on the bowl. Why? Because no cloud must come between your eyes and the fiery heart
    of the liquid. Are not the margins on book pages similarly meant to obviate the
    necessity of fingering the type-page? Again: the glass is colourless or at the
    most only faintly tinged in the bowl, because the connoisseur judges wine partly
    by its colour and is impatient of anything that alters it. There are a thousand
    mannerisms in typography that are as impudent and arbitrary as putting port in
    tumblers of red or green glass! When a goblet has a base that looks too small
    for security, it does not matter how cleverly it is weighted; you feel nervous
    lest it should tip over. There are ways of setting lines of type which may work
    well enough, and yet keep the reader subconsciously worried by the fear of 'doubling'
    lines, reading three words as one, and so forth.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Crystal Goblet
    or Printing Should be Invisible\"\r\nfrom Beatrice Warde, The Crystal Goblet,
