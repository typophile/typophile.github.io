body: This was my first attempt at a sans serif, with accompanying true italic. <BR>
  <BR>The idea behind it was to make a humanist sans with some of the organic curves
  and other elements of old woodcut serif letterforms. As such, much of the italic
  was actually developed before the roman. Also, many of the characters suggested
  alternate possibilities, so I&#39;ve developed an alternate set as well. <BR> <BR>David

    <BR> <BR>Apologies... Here is the roman set with lining figures and correct-height
    monetary and parenthetical symbols. <BR> <BR>David Thometz

  body: ' David, <BR> <BR>This is great stuff. I&#39;d love to play with this <BR>type
    in my hands. The only instances where the <BR>little terminal curls don&#39;t
    work for me are when <BR>they come in so tight &#40;lc &#39;a&#39;, ital lc &#39;m&#39;,
    &#39;n&#39;&#41; <BR>but I suppose you could specify use for display <BR>sizes
    only - it being a quirky wood type after all.  <BR> <BR>Also sad about the &#34;spear&#34;
    terminals &#40;lc &#39;f&#39;, <BR>&#39;j&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;t&#39;, &#39;z&#39;.
    They don&#39;t seem to fit in. <BR> <BR>Overall you&#39;ve managed a nice balance
    and I&#39;m <BR>sure that much was difficult to acheive. You <BR>must be a fan
    of Emigre. I see traces of Base <BR>and Triplex in there. Did you consult John
    Downer <BR>about those italics? ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Stephen '

  body: ' Heh heh.... Actually, you are correct, to a point. I do in fact like many
    of Emigre&#39;s faces, especially those of Licko and Downer, Triplex and Base
    included. <BR> <BR>The italics and alternates &#40;many of the alternates are
    upright versions of the italics, you may have noticed -- kind of a backwards evolution,
    I guess&#41; indeed took inspiration from Base and Triplex, but also Bauhaus forms
    &#40;lc &#34;m&#34;, &#34;n&#34;, &#34;r&#34;, &#34;u&#34;, &#34;w&#34; &#34;x&#34;
    and &#34;y&#34;, among others&#41; as well as some woodcut serif forms &#40;most
    of the numerals and all characters with a tilde-shaped horizontal stroke&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>The tight terminal curls &#40;lc &#34;a&#34;, ital lc &#34;a&#34;, &#34;m&#34;,
    &#34;n&#34;, et al&#41; were inspired by Jonathan Hoefler&#39;s Leviathan Italic
    -- an italic design which I absolutely love. <BR> <BR>And the caps... Well, the
    caps were origianlly going to be mostly sloped romans, but I wasn&#39;t happy
    with that. I wanted as true an italic as I could get, so I wanted that to include
    the upper case as well. Base and Goudy Sans gave me most of the ideas for those
    forms, as well as other serified italic forms. <BR> <BR>Stephen: I&#39;m not sure
    I understand your criticism of the &#34;spear&#34; terminals &#40;lc &#39;f&#39;,  <BR>&#39;j&#39;,
    &#39;r&#39;, &#39;t&#39;, &#39;z&#39;&#41;. Do you mean in the roman, the italic,
    the alternates or all three? And what about them doesn&#39;t fit? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    had some degree of success using Atlantis at text sizes, especially the italic
    and alternate sets. I&#39;ll try to post a waterfall text setting soon to show
    you how they work, but until I can get Flash to work properly, I&#39;m still a
    slave to JPEG images on 72-dpi screens. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
