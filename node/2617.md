    I&#39;ve found, at least for my own purposes, that it behaves very similarly to
    News Gothic, but with a definitely unique flavor.

  body: '&#62; <b>avenier</b> <BR> <BR>Avenir is really more of a geometric face in
    the vein of Futura, thus the name &#40;which of course means &#34;future&#34;
    in French&#41;. <BR> <BR>Kristin, if you are including American Gothic faces such
    as the ones you mentioned by MF Benton, you could also look at <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?3OO">Lightline
    Gothic</a> and <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?HV">Clearface Gothic</a>.
    Personally, I like to think of American Gothic faces as a separate &#40;sub-&#41;category
    to the mainly European Realist Grotesks, not least because most of the American
    cuts have an old-style three-storey &#34;g&#34;. ALso, FontBureau have recently
    released <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?fontname=BentonSans">Benton
    Sans</a>, a revival of this period. In fact, half the FB catalogue is derived
    from roughly this period, so you may have some luck there for some of the modern
    interpretations.'

  body: Kristin, <BR> <BR>Have you looked at my <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html"
    target="_blank">Sans Serif Font Identification Guide</a>? There are now over 750
    families classified by letterform features of 7 key letters &#40;a, e, g, G, M,
    R and y&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I will leave the genre classification to others &#40;Grotesk/Grotesque,
    and such terms are too vague and often misused&#41; and try to use a scheme that
    doesn&#39;t depend on such judgments. Look at how much difficulty experts in this
    group are having agreeing about which are which. In my opinion a classification
    scheme should be independent of such labeling attempts, because there are too
    many &#39;grey&#39; areas in the digital era fonts.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I think Mike Yanega is absolutely correct to
    state that it is nigh on impossible to classify typefaces in an academically exhaustive
    way - there are just too many exceptions to every rule you could possibly come
    up with. <BR> <BR>However, I <b><u>do</u></b> think that type classification has
    a place in every designer&#39;s universe, especially if it is conducted in a pragmatic
    and non-dogmatic manner. It can be a great help in making educated judgements
    about a particular typeface&#39;s suitability for the requirements and context
    of a given job. <BR> <BR>My own research, therefore, was simply a way for me to
    see what is out there from foundry catalogues both online and offline and to find
    my favourites in each of the categories. Of course, the standard type classification
    systems are not very useful, so I had to devise my own system of classification
    by combining, modifying and extending what is out there. I&#39;m happy with the
    results, but I have yet to devise a way to share my findings. Perhaps I&#39;ll
    get it together one day... <BR> <BR>What about you? Is it &#34;just&#34; a personal

  body: FF Super Grotesk is  a lovely typeface, in fact it&#39;s one of my faves in
    its genre. <BR> <BR>That said &#40;and as if to prove Mike Yanega&#39;s assertion
    that type classification is entirely in the eye of the beholder&#41; Super Grotesk
    is essentially Futura &#40;Super Grotesk A&#41; with an alternate three-storey
    g &#40;Super Grotesk B&#41; and a full set of ligatures &#40;Super Grotesk C&#41;,
    so for me  it&#39;s basically a geometric face with extra features, but without
    any obvious connection to classic Realist grotesques such as Akzidenz Grotesk.

    of venues such as this, the terms are relatively meaningless <BR> <BR>The value
    in type classifications became clearer to me when I studied more about the history
    of typography. Bill Moran of Blinc Publishing in St. Paul taught a class at the
    Minnesota Center for Book Arts that opened my eyes to the technological bases
    for many developments in typeface design. It was very helpful in understanding
    type design up until the digital age. Since we are still using those classic designs
    in digital form, the labels continue to be useful for me.  <BR> <BR>Also, Mike,
    I have looked at the Bowfin pages. I find his san serif guide baffling. The script
    guide, however, is more user-friendly and has saved me hours of time in identifying
    fonts. <BR> <BR>Thanks to all who suggested fonts! <BR> <BR>Kristin
