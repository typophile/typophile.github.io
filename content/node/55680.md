  that font. My specimen books did not turn up anything and neither did linotypes
  font-identifier.I even went through the whole sans-serif list on dafont, still nothing.
  Can anyone help me out with a name on this one?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Klosterfont_3500.png]"

    hand-lettered.\r\nIf you like the slightly concave stems, check out Formata. The
    \u2018a\u2019 reminds me of Steile Futura aka <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Tasse\">Tasse</a>.\r\nF"

  body: "Well spoken, Florian. ^^\r\nNormally I would agree with that theory, but
    as I know that this type is not part of the original logo - this is remake for
    a t-shirt version by a third party and they added some deliberate changes to the
    lok so as to avoid legal trouble - I strongly suspect this these letters do in
    fact come from some kind of font. \r\nLove Formata, by the way."
