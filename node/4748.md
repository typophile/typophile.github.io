  the placement was BEFORE the numbers. Nowadays, it seems like it is used more after
  them than before. I thaught atypi described the placement also before the numbers.

  body: When using the symbol of the euro I never have seen it after. When written
    298.07 Euros it is written after. Banks like to stack things in the same column.
    So they usually when showing &#39;pounds sterling&#39; &#39;dollar&#39; and &#39;euro&#39;
    they are before ..see Loyds TSB.  <BR> <BR>You probably see it after in Belgium
    or France and Spain since the people are use to using the older monetary symbols
    after. as 200 F ...25 ptas. <BR>

  body: 'Hi Koen, <BR> <BR>As a fellow Belgian I can confirm that the euro sign should  <BR>always
    be before the numerals. One little nit to pick Vince: it  <BR>should never be
    capitalized nor set in plural, so that should  <BR>be 298,07 euro.'
