  drawing my type outlines in [[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrator]] (cs).\r\nSo how do
  I get to [[Fontographer]] (4.1) from there?\r\n<!--break-->I can't seem to import
  the ai or eps files. \r\nIt keeps saying Syntax error in file.\r\nI've tryed saving
  in older formats, but that dos'nt seem to help.\r\n\r\nSo what I've been doing so
  far is pasting a bitmap into Scanfont... but that just screws up the type totaly.\r\n\r\nOR,
  should I just get used to drawing it all in Fontographer?!\r\nMan I'd hate to do
  that, since I work really quick and effectively in Illustrator.\r\n(I've seen someone
  using TypeTool, but it seems like you have to import the characters in eps one by
  one.)\r\n\r\nAnybody got a solution? How do you guys work?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n- Lasse"

  body: "Cut and paste one by one is the only way I could get characters into Fontographer
    from Illustrator 10 files, more than that, you need to have a box for each glyph
    of the height, or slightly more, of the combined height of your tallest ascender
    and lowest descender so that you keep the scale of each glyph and then once pasted
    in, delete the box (if you don't use the box everything will be the same height).
    You can vary the width of the box to set your sidebearings as well.\r\nTim"

  body: "Illustrator Experts: correct me if I'm wrong, but...\r\n\r\nIllustrator CS
    format is not backwards compatible, so you will have to export your drawings as
    Legacy AI or EPS files. But first, you'll have to copy and paste each individual
    character into a new document (reusing the same one will work), because Illustrator
    does not give you the option of exporting only selected elements on a page. Exporting
    as Illustrator 3 ought to work. In Fontographer, select File, Import, EPS, then
    import your glyphs one by one.\r\n\r\nCreating a \"bounding box\" as <strong>timd</strong>
    describes is important, so that all of your imported glyphs retain their size
    relative to each other. Also, before you begin, set your font's ascent at 1000
    and descent at 0. AFTER you have imported all of your glyphs, you can reset the
    baseline where it should be."

  body: Nick is right - you have to set your Illustrator for older formats and import
    or go back to an older version of Illustrator - I still have Illustrator 8 on
    my G5 and it will cut and paste into Fontographer if the letter form has no stroke
    or fill. FontLab can do this up to current versions.

  body: "Chank still has on his site the how-to creation of a font from Illustrator
    to Fontographer. Whether or not you can still use the newer version of Illustrator
    is a question. See the guide at\r\nhttp://www.chank.com/howto/index.php\r\n\r\nChank
    may be a bit goofy, but this is still a good guide, especially on the importance
    of drawing a bounding box next to the letters for consistent height. I have exported
    eps files created in Illustrator to Fontographer, but with Illustrator 8 (I think?).
    Cut and paste is probably the best method. With Chank and the above comments and
    help, something should work. Also, look for the updates on Fontographer from the
    new owners of the program, the FontLab folks."

    not worked for me in OSX at all. I would use native OS9 (or under) if you can.
    That is still the best environment for Fontographer.\r\n\r\nHopefully, everything
    will go more swimmingly when FontLab releases the OSX version of Fontographer
    later this year.\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "No. FontLab, especially FontLab Studio 5, is the most wacked-out software
    program I've ever had the privilege to use. FontLab 4.6 on the Mac is already
    much better than FOG. Right now, I have only used Beta versions of FontLab Studio
    5 for the PC. Eventually it will be fully released, and later a Mac version will
    follow. I can't see how any FOG upgrades could ever match the upcoming FL 5.\r\n\r\nI
    stared dabbling in type design in 1999, with FOG. I didn't make the switch to
    FontLab until February, when I began working on commercial projects. The only
    regret that I have post-switch is not having switched earlier.\r\n\r\nBesides,
    the first OSX FOG will just be the old FOG with native OSX capabilities, no new
    features. \r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: TypeTool works for me just fine. I'm sure that FontLab is a great program,
    and will get it some day soon. The benefit of TypeTool is that you do, I believe,
    get a discount on FontLab if you own it. And TypeTool is a great program at a
    very affordable price. And yes, I forgot to mention that you can only use FOG
    in Classic OS9. As for the first OSX FOG, even if it doesn't add any new features,
    the original program was after all used by zillions of font designers in the first
    place. Just write a new manual, please!

  body: The only problem with Type Tool is that you can't generate fonts in Open Type.
    Kerning is also a big problem. For the nitty-gritty stuff I agree with Dan. You
    should go with FontLab.
