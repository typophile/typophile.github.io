body: "A national newspaper client of mine has a problem with a font I created for
  them. I created an OpenType Ps flavored typeface that they were happily using on
  Macs for a few years, then recently some genius decided that everything should be
  switched to PC's, (presumably the IT department didn't have enough work to keep
  themselves busy ;^)).\r\n\r\nThey are all using InDesign CS2 (I know, update the
  system, but not the software - brilliant). Anyway, now the kerning doesn't show
  up when setting the type. I thought OT fonts of either flavor are supposed to be
  cross-platform, so why the kern problem?\r\n\r\nAnybody have any ideas? Thanks."

    for them to work properly."

    font (the VFB file, if you are using FontLab). That\u2019s the easiest way to
    detect the problem. I don\u2019t know, if I find the time to check it, but I have
    Indesign CS2 and CS3 parallel installed on my Not-Mac."

    if there are any problem of any kind (contour direction, glyphs naming, whatever..)
    the OT features fail to work on some windows programs.\r\n\r\nThat's happened
    to me on the Lobster betas, but once fixed all errors and warnings, the OT features
    started working again, like magic.\r\n\r\nNow I always run the FontQA and test
    everything twice before releasing"

  body: "I have just received a reply from the client:\r\n\r\n<em>Happy New Year.\r\nExcuse
    the delay, bit of a lull over christmas.\r\nI'm afraid I owe you an apology. We
    have found what the problem was, and it was never your font.\r\nWhen my colleague
    carried out the test with the old and new versions, he found they were exactly
    the same -- and very nicely kerned.\r\nWe went back to the tests I sent you in
    the first place, and the difference was that mine were created with our headline
    paragraph style, which was all over the place as you saw. The error was in a style
    which was nested within the main headline style, which actually turned kerning
    off. Why that should have been done, I cannot fathom.\r\nSo I owe you a big apology
    for wasting your time, not to mention casting aspersions on your typography. It
    wasn't the horrid PCs, or even our obscure software, but a traditional human cock
    up. Good thing we had someone else do the tests.</em>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had suggested
    that kerning may be turned off at the outset, and so that proved to be.\r\n\r\nThanks
    to Arno and Pablo and Karsten for your suggestions."
