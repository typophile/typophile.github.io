  but I think it is still a lot of work to do. The idea is quite simple: A squarish
  grotesk with open apertures. I would be very happy to get some comments and suggestions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Turbine_TypeSpecimen_2014_1_4468.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Turbine_TypeSpecimen_2014_2_3532.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Turbine_TypeSpecimen_2014_3_4123.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Turbine_TypeSpecimen_2014_4_5964.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Turbine_TypeSpecimen_2014_5_5657.gif]"

  body: I think /f and /t could be a little bit wider to get the same openness as
    in the other letters. I think I would make the spine of /s a bit less diagonal.
    That's all the feedback I can give. I like the typeface a lot.

  body: That's better even though I would lightly reduce the thickness of the spin.
    However it's hard to compare without other letter.

  body: I think the second /s is clearly better as it follows the squared shape of
    the other letters more clearly. I also think it's more aesthetic on its own, though
    that's probably a secondary consideration.
