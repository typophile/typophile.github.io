    des Epitaphes, printed by Jean de Tournes in Lyon (reproduced in The Typographic
    Book 1450-1935, plate 133).\r\n\r\nNow the gauntlet is set down, I'm sure somebody
    will find an even earlier example. I don't think I'm more than a few decades off,

    Geofroy Tory is the first to have used it in French printing, in 1530, in his
    pamphlet <em>Le sacre et le coronnement de la Royne, imprime par le commandement
    du Roy nostre Sire</em>, where he used it only three times, in the words <em>fa\xE7on</em>,
    <em>commen\xE7a</em> and <em>Lu\xE7on</em>. According to the same article, the

  body: "Thanks!! \r\nI was aware of the Portuguese examples, it was because of them
    that I started wondering... The Portuguese printers imported types from Spain,
    that themselves imported from Germany and France (I suppose...). Portuguese cast
    no types 'till the XVIII century, but it could have come from any foundry printing
    in Latin, right? I'm not sure it was cast for Latin, since \"\xE7\" origins are
    gothic and it became part of Latin through the vernacular form... this is where
    I get lost, when were the first forms of vernacular Latin printed... maybe this
    is a clue? Weren't the first books in Classic Latin? I don't know enough about
    Latin to answer this, that's why I searched for help! maybe someone already studied
    this :)\r\n\r\n*I thought that through this example, the \"\xE7\", I could relate
    dates and types to find out where did the types used in Portugal come from originally.
