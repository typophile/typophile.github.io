  by him to do their logo. The label is called Shack Attack Records. I''m not a huge
  fan of the name itself, so I thought focusing on S + A would make a stronger impression.
  Anways, here''s some initial logos I''ve got so far. All type is Universe. '

  body: '''shack'' seems like such a great term to play with. I''d suggest exploring
    some actual shack icons.'

  body: Agreed with @ratbaggy, add more impact. As one of my old typographic professors
    would say you haven't pushed the concept. You just chose two letters and slapped
    them in a circle. Reminds me of a road sign or a railroad circle sign. Push it
    farther.

  body: "What style of music will they be releasing? That could make a difference
    as to what direction you push it in.\r\n\r\nAlso why Shack Attack? I know the
    term as meant to sound like \"Shark Attack!\" in an exaggerated Australian accent,
    from the 1980's glossy jazz-funk band Shakatak. If it has the same meaning perhaps
    you could play with shark imagery too. A shark attacking a shack!\r\nMaybe I'm
    going to far, but S-shaped shark and A-shaped shack!!!!"

    direction i would look at typefaces made by engineers for labelling high voltage
    boxes and such. Something like Gravur from lineto.com and such \"industrial faces\".
    Maybe a stencil style of those could bring more \"attack\", if needed.\r\nUnivers
    is too much a typeface, too smart, too well executed."

  body: 3&4 work the best, with a different type treatment on 4. Nice colors, simple
    lock-up. But I agree that there are better ideas to be mined out of the name.
