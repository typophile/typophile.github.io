  body: "Mainly because of the x-width, none's perfectly matching but you could try
    any of them: [[http://www.dafont.com/sf-collegiate.font|Collegiate]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/machine/|Machine]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/masheen/|Masheen]]\r\nAnother one worth
    of consideration is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/reserves/reload|Reload]] better
    in term of balance and x-width but you'd have to deal with an off /R leg (but
    not hard to customize)."
