  body: Wikipedia notes that the X Window System at one time included support for
    this font format, so at least the details of the format are available, and so
    support <em>could</em> theoretically be added to an open-source font program like
    FontForge.

  body: "Actually, the reason I was interested is that my X Windows installation has
    a directory full of .spd fonts, and I'm just curious as to what they actually
    contain... I have no burning need to work with this format.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Those files contain highly compressed spline outlines, (non-beziers of any
    kind), piecewise-linear hinting and require their own interpreter to even get
    the em data much less each curve. \r\n\r\nIt is a good thing you don't need them,
    but if you did, the same designs are all available from Myfonts, in the Bitstream
    aisle. Happy hunting."

  body: It just amuses me that the name was doubtless inspired by the Speedball family
    of drawing pens, but was changed to avoid infringing on their trademark... and
    what it was changed <em>to</em>, of course, is the trademark of a line of swimwear.
