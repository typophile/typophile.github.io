body: "Today, through Firefox I changed the default font for displaying Armenian texts
  on the web from Mshtakan to Segoe UI (I have a Mac). So far there haven't been any
  problems with Armenian websites, however on facebook (see imege below) the lowercase
  letters |\u0580| and |\u0564| of Segoe UI are being replaced with the letters |\u0580|
  and |\u0564| from Verdana. Not that I mind it, but I'm very curious as to why is
  this happening. (On Typophile too, these letters are being replaced from Segoe UI
  to Verdana.) \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rehverdana_4330.png]\r\n\r\nAlso,
  is there a way of changing the defult fonts for displaying Armenian through the
  Mac System on Snow leopard, as well as on the keyboard viewer. Thank you."

  body: "A curious issue, but these seem to work okay on Windows. How did you get
    these fonts on the Mac? Armenian is new to the Windows 8 versions of these fonts
    and I don't think we include them with any Microsoft Mac product.\r\n\r\nSi"

    I hit 32 mph hour I hear a strange noise?

    that this kind of an error has occurred with a font supporting Armenian. Thanks

    Maybe the admins could fix it."

  body: "It looks to me like those two characters (U+0564/0580) are the only Armenian
    characters in Verdana.  Why would someone do that?\r\n\r\nSo I suppose the site
    is set up to use Verdana by default and has to use some other font for all the
    other characters.....\r\n\r\nPS I don't know of any way to change the default
    fonts used by OS X for Keyboard Viewer or elsewhere in the OS."

  body: 'That makes sense, this not the Windows 8 version of Verdana. Earlier versions
    of Verdana only included the two Armenian characters required for the currency.
    Complete Armenian coverage drawn by Ruben Tarumian was added to the Windows 8
    version. '
