  font used in a dutch interior architecture magazine called FRAME. I'd love to know
  how this beautiful typeface is called and where I can purchase it. It has some neat
  features, for example the minor \xBBr\xAB has a dot-shaped terminal, the minor \xBBt\xAB
  has that interesting figure. I would be greatful if you could help me out, here.
  Thanks in advance :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/humanist_touch_grotesque_3815.jpg]"

      I found out, that there obviously was an alternative r included in the glyphs.
      Thanks, it is the Circular Typeface. '
