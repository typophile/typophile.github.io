  Extensis Suitcase to manage my fonts on my Mac. \r\n\r\nAnybody have any suggestions
  for which font management program to use for windows?\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

    offering. Extensis also owns Font Reserve but it doesn't seem as if they're doing
    much with it.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: i'm on a PC and don't use font management because i doubt that there's anything
    for PC that will significantly improve my font handling. that's why i'm hoping
    Linotype's venture will prove to be a boon for type users.

    used Font Reserve in a PC they had (all of the other machines were mac) and it
    worked very good, type was very easy to find and activate. The had many many fonts
    on this machine since recieved ads and many local magazines and small papers to
    print in this machine.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: I am rather fond of <a href="http://www.proximasoftware.com/" target="_blank">Font
    Expert</a>, and unassuming little program with a lot of nice extras (like the
    ability to configure specimen pages). It's gotten a little pricier (now $49, instead
    of the $29 I paid several years ago), but it's still a pretty good deal.
