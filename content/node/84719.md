    the time of Starling's release). http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a2fa033e-7ca1-11de-a7bf-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1VU3GtUzR

    a conference of ATypI in San Francisco in 1994. Soon thereafter his findings appeared
    in <em>Printing History</em>, iss. 31\u201332 (vol. XVI, nos. 1 and 2), 1994."

    Turns out that the moon landings were all staged in a warehouse in Tacoma! The
