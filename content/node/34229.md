  a couple of typefaces! (pathetic)\r\n\r\nI'm a university student and I'm looking
  for a pair to work well with plain, black-and-white double spaced research papers
  written in Microsoft Word (I do apologize). I'm searching after:\r\n\r\nSans:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Boldyish
  face for headings</li>\r\n<li>it's italic for book titles</li>\r\n<li>possibly it's
  caps if not expensive</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSerif:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Good text at 12pt double
  spaced Word</li>\r\n<li>it's italic</li>\r\n<li>it's caps</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for something slightly away from the standard Helvitica Bold and Times;
  something that still would look natural in such a setting, but yet also establish
  a personal, unique style and make an impression on the graders of the paper. Hopefully
  I can find this <strong>under a couple hundred</strong> (the more I can get for
  that amount the better however), but most preferably with typefaces that I could
  expand with other weights when I strike it rich. Perhaps you could make a few suggestions.\r\n\r\nmany
  thanks\r\n\r\nsean"

    compliment is of some importance -- one reason Times is prevalent.\r\n\r\nParenthetically,
    I would hope that the teachers would not let the grade be influenced by typeface
    selection (unless it is somehow relevant)."
