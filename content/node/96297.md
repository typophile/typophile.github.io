  Cut Gothic</a> and made it available for free at <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/half-cut-gothic.font\">Dafont</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.fontspace.com/elling-lien/half-cut-gothic\">FontSpace</a>,
  but now a marketing firm here in Canada has contacted me regarding \"ownership purchase\".
  Considering it has been available for free for so long, how is it possible to change
  that? If copyright-wise this is even possible, how much do you think would be a
  fair price? ...Anything else I should be wary of?\r\n\r\nThey don't seem too concerned
  about the freeware part. Quote: \r\n<blockquote>\"Since we have already used the
  font in some of our pieces, we'd like to continue using it, rather than creating
  a new font. We are ok knowing that people may have purchased the font already -
  but would be curious to know moving forward if we could purchase the ownership for
  the font.\"</blockquote>"

    parties might still be <em>distributing</em> it, not just using it (which even
    happens to non-free fonts); and if they mind, they would have to be the ones trying
    to get them to stop, not you.\r\n3) The price should depend on a host of things,
    some difficult to nail down. Looking at the font, but not knowing anything about
    your customer, shooting from the hip I would say $3000 (leaving room for negotiation).\r\n\r\nIf
    you're the type to worry that an eventual lawsuit might threaten your assets,
    do talk to a lawyer. But to me this case doesn't seem tricky enough to waste the
    money. And remember, you have to keep the lawyer happy too...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    reply. \r\n\r\nFonts distributed for free have a way of spreading across the internet
    to a million other free font sites, but I'm trying to contact the sites I'm finding
    it on to remove it.\r\n\r\nConsidering I don't go ahead with hiring a lawyer,
    is there somewhere online I could find sample contracts for transferring ownership?"
