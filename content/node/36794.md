body: "I might have missed threads discussing this, but is anyone else having problems
  with Typophile's search facility? \r\n\r\nTo find certain threads, I am having to
  track my own posts/comments to find them. When I do a search or advanced search,
  the results now seem more limited following Typophile's recent overhaul.\r\n\r\nIn
  one case I can find a thread via my own tracking, but it is not even listed within
  the forum topic. For example, thread: http://www.typophile.com/node/20091 exists
  but when I looked for it by name under 'Special Interest Groups' > 'Typographic
  Education', I can't see it listed there.\r\n\r\nIf it's me or my browser, please
  ignore me. But is anyone else experiencing similar issues?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/32357\">this thread</a> will surely help.\r\n\r\nSo,
    make yourself a bookmark with the following as the address:\r\njavascript:void(q=prompt('Search%20Typophile:',''));if(q)void(location.href='http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com'+'%20'+escape(q))\r\n[Kudos
    to <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/user/1011\">Grant Hutchinson</a>]\r\n\r\nAnd
    in case you don\u2019t like Google, feel free to replace its url with that of
    a competitor \u2026"

    that were once visible in the forum topic listing are now no longer listed, but
    remain accessible through via these search workarounds. '
