body: "I'm looking for a free digital version of DIN. There must be some free digital
  version of DIN, but the ones I found in quick searches all seem to be illegal copies
  of proprietary versions.\r\n\r\nThe price isn't so much of an issue as the rights:
  I may want to be able to distribute it to many other people, but I definitely want
  to put it on a server that would generate images automatically, and it's not unlikely
  that some situation would come up where certain aspects of most licensing agreements
  would be problematic.\r\n\r\nI don't have to use DIN exactly, but it would work
  quite well stylistically.\r\n\r\nWhere may I find a digital font that suits my needs?"

    generating images on a server may not actually be against most EULAs. \r\n\r\nIdeally,
    you'd be able to find an open source typeface, but barring that, I don't think
    you're out of luck...you just need to read through some of the licenses."

  body: The generation of the images won't be against the license agreement, but I
    wouldn't be surprised if something else about the management of the server would
    cause problems.
