  body: Similar to T-26 <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=272&amp;dw=540"
    target="_blank">Curvature Black</a>. Looks like the letters could have been manipulated
    to make them unicase.

  body: Looks like I agree with Ryan. That thread was never closed either. That&#39;s

  body: There is also a fair resemblance to House <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=COMPRIME-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank">Chalet Comprime 1970</a>, with some of the alternate letters from
    the other faces in the family.
