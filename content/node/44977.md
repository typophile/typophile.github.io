    a look at this: <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/03/ffee.html\">Font
    Folio Education Essentials</a> by Adobe, in cooperation with AIGA. You\u2019ll
    get not only Grotesque MT Extra Condensed, but the whole family, plus another
    490 top-notch fonts. $149 should really be a bargain."
