		<div class="commentbody">Hrant &ndash;  <BR> <BR>Thinking about it last night, I realized the same thing about your formula: it's circular. A word like &quot;gypsy,&quot; with 5 letters and 4 descenders, comes out equal in score to a word like &quot;preapproving&quot; with 12/4.  <BR> <BR>So, are you looking for merely a high proportion of descenders? Pygmy and gypsy are 90%. Or are you looking for a long ascenderless word? Perspicaciousness is 17, but only 2 descenders. Prepossessing is 13/3. Preapproving and preoccupying are both 12/4. That's the best combination I've managed to come up with so far.  <BR> <BR>But I've been ruling out 't'. I'll think on it some more and see what else I can come up with. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Syzygy <BR> <BR>I'll be darned - that's a word! And a rich one too, in both meaning and descender-space. But of course with a frequency of zero in Kucera. <BR> <BR>So &quot;gypsy&quot; is the leader now (go David!), with a frequency of 4 (&quot;poppy&quot; and &quot;puppy&quot; are 2). And I like it best because it's not mostly just a bunch of &quot;p&quot;s. Mine was &quot;pygmy&quot;, btw. I also came up with &quot;ping-pong&quot;, but it's weak (in a number of ways). <BR> <BR>A frequency of 4 isn't great, but considering how rare descenders are in English*, it's not bad. Can anybody do a Score of 5? <BR> <BR>* <A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/image/s_rome1-4.gif" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/image/s_rome1-4.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/image/s_rome1-4.gif</a></A> <BR> <BR>&gt; So, are you looking for merely a high proportion of descenders? <BR> <BR>Originally I was looking for a word that has the most descenders both in number as well as proportion. So a good equation might have been d^2 * c (instead of c * d/c , the original one), where d is the number of descenders and c the number of characters. So &quot;gray&quot; would have scored 16 and &quot;pygmy&quot; would have scored 16*5 = 80. <BR> <BR>But that's too math-y (in this context), so I figured to just settle for the number of descenders, especially since the original equation was that anyway. <BR> <BR>&gt; Or are you looking for a long ascenderless word? <BR> <BR>No, but it would definitely also be useful to find: <BR>1. The longest word with no extenders at all: the word with the smallest height. <BR>2. The longest word with the greatest proportion of extenders: the word with the greatest height. <BR>(Non-exotic is a big plus.) <BR> <BR>The current search is for the word with the lowest &quot;center of gravity&quot;. The word with the highest CoG is less interesting, because it's more in line with general behavior of English. I'm looking for aberrations. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

But that suffix is a little forced. How about inattentiveness at 15; the suffix is a little less awkward here. But, okay skip that; there's uncommunicative (15) and incommensurate (14) and intermissions (13). <BR> <BR>If you nix the 't', it gets a little trickier, but there's inconvenience (13) or recursiveness (13) or incisiveness (12). But if you're going to throw Kucera back in the mix, then all bets are off. Obviously, the longer the word, the lower it's likely to score on a frequency scale.
