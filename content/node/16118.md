  body: "All I can think of is Law firms and brokerage firms.  They are all lists
    of names. Eventually they either succumb to logic and adopt a shorter name or
    use an acronym.\r\nSometimes the full name is used until a brand is identified.
    Then they switch to something logo-able later.  I have never seen a laundry list
    brand-name which works as a logo. You may be bucking with the partner ego problem
    where each partner wants billing.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nMerril, Lynch, Pierce,
