  typefaces represent different emotions, how can one say that Comic sans is a fun
  font, what are the feature which make it \"FUN\".\r\nI am learning about different
  types of emotions.I am studying Navras( nine emotions)\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasa_(aesthetics).\r\ni
  want to know how emotions can be searched in a font ?"

    significantly greater success eliciting assistance with school work if you can
    demonstrate what you have accomplished first. Good luck, and may the fonts be
    with you\u2122."

    first.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure where to start, you might research some basic
    graphic design principals. What shapes look masculine or feminine? Bold or subtle?
    Formal or casual? Static or active? And so forth. "

    body: "thanks..\r\ni have started my project by studying 9 emotions. After that
      i will select fonts from different categories like serif, sans-serif, script,
      display and slab serif and start studying about there anatomy .\r\nhow these
      emotions can be searched in a font. i have found 4 methods for it\r\nElimination-if
      i remove some feature from a typeface.is there any effect?\r\nAddition- if i
      add some feature to a typeface.what kind of feeling it gives?\r\nparing method-
      if i have two type faces and comparing them.\r\nestablished font- there are
      some fonts which already have emotion to it.like i quote the example of comic
      sans..studying those fonts.\r\nsituation-emotions are related to situation.If
      i change the font on a b'day card from script to slab serif. what effect it
      will produce.\r\ni have just reached upto this level..\r\ni dont knw how to
      proceed further..\r\nCan you suggest me some research paper on emotions in typography
      or some books related to it\r\n"

    be curious if you took the same general notion & tried to investigate the emotional
    effects of spoken dialect within a group that spoke the same language. Isn't that
    the same question?\r\n\r\nOr, staying with type, how many novels are set in a
    sans-serif typeface in the States, esp. from a large New York publishing house?
    How about in Germany? So, if you asked a question about sans-serif fonts in the
    different countries, wouldn't you expect different answers? Or isn't \"comfort\"
    a significant element in any \"emotion\"?\r\n\r\nEtc."

    you\u2019ll get several good hits on the first page. The journal Visible Language
    might be a good place for you to start as it is a bit easier to read that most
    peer-reviewed scientific journals in that is is also geared towards a design population.
    If your academic institution has certain database access you may want to read:\r\n\r\nBrumberger,
    E. (2004). The rhetoric of typography: Effects on reading time, reading comprehension
    and perception of ethos. <em>Technical Communication 51(1)</em>, 13\u201324.\r\n\r\nBut
    this might not be for you, unless you are interested investigating things from
    a scientific or empirical perspective. \r\n\r\nBe mindful however, knowing how
    to conduct a proper literature review is critical to being able to conduct thorough
    research. You never know who or what might be providing you with misinformation\u2026"

  body: "I'm not sure how \"elimination\" and \"addition\" will help you. The \"pairing\"
    method you mentioned (comparison of different fonts) might be helpful.\r\n\r\nRemember
    that most people are not typography experts, and any emotions they get from fonts
    will just be a quick gut reaction based on the general look of the font. (Does
    the font look formal? Casual? Wild? Precise? Modern? Old fashioned? etc.)\r\n\r\nAre
    you a design student? Have you taken courses in typography or graphic design?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
