  body: The classic children&#39;s book D&#39;Aulaires&#39; Greek Myths uses the same
    lettering/type. It could be a font, or it could be they did it based on the book
    title. I don&#39;t remember ever seeing this in any of my old type specimen books,
    so I&#39;m leaning towards the latter. Also, the &#34;A&#34; on side of the book
    &#40;used in the word &#34;D&#39;AULAIRES&#39;&#34;&#41; is different from the
    &#34;A&#34; in &#34;MYTHICA&#34;.

    antique shapes. Let&#39;s fire up Illustrator <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Seems so similar, but as you already notice, &#34;A&#34; glyph is different.
    Thank you for scans.
