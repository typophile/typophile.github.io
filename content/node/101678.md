  body: That must be it. Although the A in the example I have doesn't have a double
    crossbar. Thanks for solving it defiantone!

  body: There may be other fonts, other versions, or some with alternates.  You only
    posted 4 letters. If your sample has additional characters, how are we expected
    to match them if you don't provide them?   - Herb

  body: "It looks a lot like the classic '20s and '30s Italian art deco typeface.\r\nThe
    word itself makes sense in Italian, \"lire\"... was it taken from some poster?\r\nYou

    might be a good alternative, even including the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/carouselambra/regular/glyphs.html#glyphs/557116/441|interlocked

  body: The other letters are overlaying a background image at about 20% opacity.
    I didn't think they would be very helpful. To get these four letters I had to
    bring them in to photoshop and crank up the contrast and invert the layer. All
    of these other suggestions are great. Thanks everyone for the help.
