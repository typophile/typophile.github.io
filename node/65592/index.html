  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Ridley is a high-end Belgian bicycle manufacturer with a very amateur-ish wordmark. You can see it on one of their bikes here: <a href="http://www.maraton.si/images/ridley9/Orionframesetbllue.jpg">http://www.maraton.si/images/ridley9/Orionframesetbllue.jpg</a></p>
<p>This is NOT AN OFFICIAL PROJECT! I took this upon myself to see if I could refine the wordmark to better reflect the quality and prestige of their bicycle frames.</p>
<p>The first 4 letters (RIDL) I think just need some minor refinements to make them more consistent and typographically sound, but the last two letters (EY) really make me squirm. I know they could be regarded as &ldquo;whimsical&rdquo; or somehow &ldquo;endearing&rdquo;, but to me they seem highly out of place and almost comically poor in their design.</p>
<p>Please feel free to critique my refined version, as it is still a work in progress. I appreciate the professional opinions of my fellow designers. Have a great day (and a Merry Christmas too!) everyone!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Being a cycling enthusiast myself i can’t connect such techy lettering to something as fast &amp; light as a racing bike. And to be honest, i don’t see much improvement in your proposal. The first stroke of your R is strange. And how the wordmark ends is even worse than the original. It doesn’t read as a Y anymore, there is just some bad stroke coming out of the E that leads to a I in false degree.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your input. After I posted, I looked at it some more and have made some more changes (isn&rsquo;t this always the way). I have to disagree about the techy lettering comment though. I think racing bikes are marvels of technology and engineering, and I feel the branding should reflect this commitment to always make things more high-tech, lighter, more aerodynamic and above all else–faster. Look at the wordmarks of LOOK, Giant, TIME, TREK, BMC and Cervelo - they are all definitely on the techy side of things, while brands like Colnago, MOOTS, Orbea and Wilier are more classical and timeless. I think this look really reflects who these companies are and what they produce. A company like Ridley though, I feel belongs in the techy camp. They&rsquo;re constantly pushing the boundaries of engineering, introducing new technologies and processes and strives to be the best possible bikes available. I do appreciate your comments regarding the first and last letters&hellip; I have taken them into consideration.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Brian,
Your observation about the various wordmarks and their historical roots of this tiny industry is right. However this techy look of the Ridley wordmark is anything than modern and up-to-date, thinking of the carbon technology today’s bikes are built upon.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I do feel yours is an improvement on their wordmark. It&rsquo;s much cleaner and tighter (I can&rsquo;t stand their &ldquo;E&rdquo;). Your &lsquo;Y&rsquo; though does need some refining.</p>
<p>Try making the initial stroke of the &lsquo;R&rsquo; and the last stroke of the &lsquo;Y&rsquo; parallel with each other. Also, why does the stroke get fatter at both of those places? Shouldn&rsquo;t it — in keeping with the rest of the letters — be fixed width?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Re: J Weltin - I think you&rsquo;re missing the point a bit here. The goal here (set by me) was only to refine their existing wordmark, not a complete overhaul or a new design completely. In doing so, I must retain the &lsquo;feel&rsquo; of the existing wordmark. Whatever that may be to you is completely subjective.</p>
<p>Re: penn.and.ink - Thanks for your compliments and recommendations. I&rsquo;ve made a second version (attached) taking into account some feedback I&rsquo;ve received here as well as from some fellow designers and cyclists on twitter.</p>
<p>Some notable changes to this version:</p>
<p>• Reduced the shear angle by about 10 degrees
• Made each of the letterforms a bit thinner
• Reduced the amount of horizontal scale
• Revised the initial stroke of the R and the last stroke of the Y to be parallel figures
• Broke apart the L and E
• Made more of a visual break between the E and the Y
• Rounded the other top corner of the L</p>
<p>Overall, I think this one sits better. Thoughts?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ridley2_4535.jpg]</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Your rounding of the corners is inconsistent. Specifically, I and E have their top left corners rounded, D doesn&rsquo;t, and L has its right corner rounded.</p>
<p>Also the middle horizontal stroke in R sticks out for me. I think it should really be of the same thickness as the rest of horizontal strokes in the wordmark. I understand that it is consistent with E, but IMO they both are better be made thicker.</p>

<h2 id="br-">tech aside or not, your approach has an air of rigidity to it&hellip;but as you&rsquo;re quick to point out, you set the goals yourself. Subjective or not, I don&rsquo;t think it retains the same &lsquo;feel&rsquo; as the original.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for all the feedback. This is proving to be much more difficult than I had originally planned. The more I look at the original E in the Ridley wordmark, the less I hate it. I think it&rsquo;s still rather odd-looking, but as I strive to come up with a better solution, I&rsquo;m beginning to think that their E isn&rsquo;t as terrible as I had thought.</p>
<p>In regards to the inconsistent rounding of the corners, I think that they work in this instance if you look at the space between the letters rather than the letters themselves. Maybe. If I were designing a typeface, I would probably keep things consistent, but I&rsquo;m designing a 5-letter wordmark, and as such, I&rsquo;m designing these 5 glyphs to work best in their current setting.</p>
<p>I do think that the middle horizontal stroke in the R and the E could be beefed up. Good eye, thanks!</p>
<p>In regards to the rigidity&hellip; yeah, I hear you. Any suggestions on how to make it a little more lively??</p>

<p>no body (that I&rsquo;m aware of) would look at a logo mark in that way, nor should you need a disclaimer.</p>
<p>As for making it less rigid, a couple of things noticed, you removed some of the slant, so straight away the mark moves slower, it&rsquo;s also got a lot to do with the sweeping lines of the original forms, the rounded R, D and E - you&rsquo;ve replaced them with more rigid shapes.</p>
