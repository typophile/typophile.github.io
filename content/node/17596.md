body: "For all who may find them useful, I've just posted a series of [[Python]]/[[RoboFab]]
  scripts for typeface design/production. These scripts have been developed for the
  way that I work, so your milage with them may vary. Currently they have all been
  tested with [[FontLab]] 4 and [[RoboFab]] 1.1 on the Mac. There are scripts for
  automatic placing of accents, dealing with development VFB files with lots of overlaps
  and composites, quickly generating multiple [[instances]] of a [[MultipleMaster]]
  typeface for testing, and a couple of other things.\r\n\r\nThe scripts can be found
  at http://www.benkiel.com/typeDesign/"

  body: Thanks, Ben. I look forward to experimenting with these. The accent placement
    script looks quite similar to something I've been wanting for a long time. (Yo,
    Adam, where's my friggin' composite management script already?)

    pesky overlaps while preserving your original. I didn't realize I needed it, but
    smile every time I save a minute. The accent generator is also useful and I'm
    experimenting with tayloring it to my own workflow.\r\n\r\nCan you tell us a little
    more about your workflow with accent glyphs?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nRandy"

  body: "<em>Randy:</em>\r\nI create my accented glyphs as one of the later things
    I do in a design. Once I've designed the accents, tested them briefly with Spanish,
    German, and French, and feel that they are appropriate weight and size, I start
    placing anchors for everything. This usually takes a bit of time to get right,
    as deciding what the optical centers for your glyphs and accents are is more of
    an art than a strict number. To help speed placing along, I start with anchors
    in the center of the glyph (halfway from furthest left edge to the furthest right
    edge). The scripts for placing anchors does this automatically for me. I then
    check and adjust as need be. Depending on the design of the typeface this can
    be a lot of adjustment or not so much adjustment (geometric Sans? very simple.
    very calligraphic Roman? lots of adjustment). \r\n\r\nWith my anchors placed,
    I run my script and start to check the glyphs. Some accents, such as the cedilla
    and ogonek, need to be further incorporated into the design. Most glyph, however,
    if the anchors were placed well, are done.\r\n\r\nI sometimes go a bit overboard
    and do accent designs for capitals, lowercase, and small capitals. That's why
    my script allows one to have different designs for each: otherwise creating all
    of those glyphs by hand would take far too long.\r\n"
