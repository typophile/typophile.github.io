body: "Trying to ID the very condensed serif face with slab ends (not slab serifs
  - I'm not sure 'slab' is the correct term). The sample in the image is ALL the letters
  and numbers used in this face on the counters for this game: C, I, 1, 2, 3, 4. The
  2 looks very distinctive, though. I tried Identifont, but it doesn't suggest anything
  with those slab ends to the 3 and top of the 2 - only Bodoni and relatives with
  ball-ends.\r\n\r\nNot much to go on, but any help is appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks"
