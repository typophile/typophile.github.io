body: "Hi.\r\n\r\nI'm creating the visual identity for a newly founded church. The
  main group is about 18-35 years old, mostly students and young families. We strive
  to not grow old (Don't we all?), so I'll probably aim the identity at 18-20 year
  olds. Everything needs to be kept as cheap as possible since we don't have much
  money, but I really want to create something unique. Church design is, in general,
  terrible.\r\n\r\nAnyways, here's my issue: We use type in many areas: Music lyrics
  for projector, Powerpoint presentations (yeah!) for projector, our website, interactive
  cd-roms and a lot of printed material. I intend to use Dolly as one of our base
  typefaces, but we can't afford to buy a lot of licenses.\r\nEx.: Everyone speaking
  in church is responsible for creating their own Powerpoint presentation, with the
  obvious dreadful result. \r\nI'm going to set specific rules for typography and
  composition, but I can't just e-mail everyone a commercial font like Dolly.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions? Should I use a \"web safe\" font like Georgia, since everyone probably
  have it, or should I look for a free font? (I know this probably isn't a good place
  to ask for suggestions.) I read some place about creating styles in MS Word with
  specific names, and when you imported the documents into InDesign you could define
  different specifications for those styles. Is there something similar in Powerpoint?\r\n\r\n-
  Frode"

    the costume fit the occasion. Consider the backgrounds for type and work for contrast
    and legibility.

    lyrics this sunday. I've really got some work to do:)

    during the day. If you can provide some help or suggestions, please post! \r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: "Often when a corporate identity package is created, one set of rules for
    designers and another for everyday use is specified. For instance, you might say
    that Dolly should be used on all events posters, committee logos, pamphlets, etc.
    and Georgia should be used for daily memos, correspondence, PowerPoint presentations,
    etc.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: with all of the many ministries in a church, good luck getting everyone to
    abide by set standards. website, identity, and other more permanent things to
    be designed wont be a problem, but unless youre one of the only people designing
    in the church, i can see your rules being overlooked. i hope things work out though.
    its painful seeing such bad design in churches and on church material.
