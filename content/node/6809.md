    <BR>I swear it&#39;s the coffee that&#39;s getting to me. I&#39;m slowly going

  body: BTW As contemporary interpretations of blackletters go, this one  <BR>kicks
    some serious booty. Very interesting, and quite beautiful. <BR> <BR>Plus, it&#39;s
    nice to see that glyphs which would not be readible as  <BR>separated units &#40;s,
    t, A&#41; become legible when in context, which  <BR>proves theories of Tobias
    Frere-Jones, Emigre, LetTerror and  <BR>others.
