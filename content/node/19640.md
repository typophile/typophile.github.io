  body: "Well, if no one else is going to come around, I'll bounce some things back
    to ye. I'll say I like this quite a bunch. It has character, for sure. My humble
    opinion:\r\nMaybe lower A bar\r\nMaybe take middle of B higher\r\nMaybe extend
    bar on EF a little\r\nBar of G doesn't go\r\nJ terminal needs something\r\nMaybe
    take point of M down a bit\r\nQ could do with more equilibrium, maybe center that
    tail under the O form (...I might like it if I could see it next to a U)\r\nS
    too small on top\r\nV and W bottom serifs ought to be bracketed\r\nY too thin
    at confluence\r\nI could see this, like, engraved onto a wooden sign outside of
    a quaint family restaurant or motel, or maybe on the cover of a book I'd like
    to read.... Don't normalize it too much--keep some of the seemingly odd proportions--because
    that's where the charm comes from. \r\nCheers\r\nNathanael"

  body: Yea great comments. To add on...from an aestheitc aspect...The C and G is
    too funky. Doesnt fit in well. The S isnt balanced properly. I would open the
    top aperture up more and push it to the left. The crossbar on the E anf F can
    be a little longer. Also the crosspointon the X can be lower (reminds me of Steve
    Urkel pants). The tail on the Q seems out of place because the design is so classical.
    And it looks like its barely hanging on. But your consistency is nice. I like
    where its headed.
