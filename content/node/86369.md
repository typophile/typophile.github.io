  the photo on my phone, its from the latest issue of Eye magazine. Can't remember
  exactly what the article was about but looks its perhaps the visual identity for
  Camden Arts Centre.\r\n\r\nMany thanks as always,\r\n\r\nDan"

    sure if its available for purchase though. A quick search didn't offer up much,
    but the name 'Helix New' suggests that it might well be based on old Helix letter
    stencils.\r\n"
