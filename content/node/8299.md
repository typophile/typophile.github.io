  body: I did not not link to the FontFont showing, because it seemed &#39;buggy&#39;,
    instead of &#39;Scala&#39; the sample displayed &#39;Strada&#39;.. <i>&#40; And
    vice versa.. &#41;</i> And, it still does, am I the only one seeing <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=FF.11118.1.5"
    target="_blank">this</a>.? <i>Hmm..</i>

  body: BTW I did not <i>invent</i> that technique as others also found out  <BR>how
    to do it, independently from me. It&#39;s just that I released  <BR>this trick
    to the general public, and now everyone and their  <BR>dog is faster than me,
    darnit! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
