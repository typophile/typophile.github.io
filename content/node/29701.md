  the title font, especially the Gs. Does anyone know of similar typefaces that were
  used in the time period of the film (post-WWII)? "

  body: "If you want to know what Nick Curtis' inspiration was, you could e-mail him
    and ask. His address is shown on the page I linked to, above.\r\n\r\nMy guess
    for the origin of square counters wouldn't be sign painting--I'm a sign painter,
    and I'm not often tempted to do square counters. It's much easier to paint curves
    than perfectly straight lines, let me tell you!\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the square
    counters come from calligraphy, specifically from <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=BT.107382.0.0\">blackletter
    faces</a>, where broad, flat pen nibs create a squared-off look. \r\n\r\nSkylar"

    target="_blank">archive</a> of info about Nick's fonts. In the case of Day Poster
    Black, it is, "An extrabold utilitarian font based on the work of 30s lettering
    artist Harold Holland Day" and the source was Day's 1931 book Modern Brush Lettering.
