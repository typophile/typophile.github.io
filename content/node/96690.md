    body: 'Hi Hrant, The up/down twists is coming from humanistic approach. Bengali
      calligraphy and handwriting follows this format, which makes the font/text more
      readable. We were suppose to design the Star Bengali as per the given brief.
      The channel is in Bengali language, so the expected version should be readable
      on various screens. I hope, you got the answers. '

    body: Hi Prabhkar, I suppose, there are very few fonts which are developed with
      proper design process. Very few design gives justice to Indian scripts. In Indian,
      the awareness about font purchase is still very poor. Market is huge, but the
      font purchasing practice is not developed. 2-4% buying is not happening. Regards

    - thanks for explaining.\r\nWould you say this parallels something the Latin is
    trying to do?\r\n\r\nBTW what about my second question?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "@ Hrant, Will you pls elaboration this question. Would you say this parallels
      something the Latin is trying to do? I didn't get you clearly.\r\n\r\nInitially
      Star was suppose to use Latin Fedra San, but I have not received any further
      information. Creating Fedra Bengali will create copy-right infringement issues,
      so we decided to design indigenous Star Bengali. "
