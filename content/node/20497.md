  they think dog owners need to be spoken to slowly? :-)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n/stephen\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nodogs_5230.jpg]"

    for the sign, a friend took it for me somewhere in her travels, but I can't remember
    where. This is the full image. Perhaps that board in the bottom-right is a clue,
    but it's not enough of one for me.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nodogs-full_3857.jpg]"

  body: "Cut'n'pasting from <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/20302\">another thread</a>:\r\n\r\nYou
    have to realise that this kind of lettering is output device-specific: it is a
    set of characters that is produced specifically for a certain type of sign making
    machine. This means it has no equivalent in what we know as digital fonts.\r\n\r\nOther
    examples are alphabets available for the stamping machines that produce automobile
    license plates, for sowing and embroidery machines, for stone engraving et al.
    It just is a different world. In some rare cases you\u2019ll find alphabets that
    have digital font counterparts, but more often than not they will be unique to
    that reproduction system."

    close?\r\n\r\nSo does that mean the people making the machines start from scratch
    each time? Or is there a set of non-digital sets that they'll call on? "

    seems to be a Richard Coeur De Lion/Lion-Heart coat of arms (the red one with
    three golden lions passing). I can't see the top one who could be the city emblem
    (or anything else, of course, as well as the one in the very corner).\r\nJust
    because I'm terribly curious, could you please post that detail a bit bigger?"

    suppose they must have their \"type\" manufacturers as well, but this probably
    is a parallel circuit with little to no overlaps with the digital world.\r\n\r\nAs
    for similar typefaces, what about H&FJ's <a herf=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/knockout/series_b.html\">Knockout
    No. 32: Junior Cruiserweight</a> or Jim Parkinson's <a href=\"http://www.typedesign.com/fonts/ballight.html\">Balboa
    Light</a>? YouWorkForThem's <a href=\"http://youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0020\">Ultramagnetic</a>
    is more condensed but has the rounded corners."

  body: "Stephen,\r\nThanks a lot!\r\nJust the few things I could find out using the
    little memories I have of heraldry. The half crest on the top is an early Plantagenets
    and the half near the \"M\" is a late for the same bloodline, probably taken from
    the Tudor coat of arms. Just below the \"M\" there's what looks like the city
    of York's crest, but the color of the cross should be red not black, so it could
    be something completely different.\r\nThe only thing that makes me link again
    the place with that county is the Yorkshire White Rose below the Lion-Heart and
    the (maybe)York crests.\r\nI couldn't figure out the three at the bottom.\r\nI
    had some serious geek-fun with this :)"
