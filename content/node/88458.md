  body: "It depends on the amount of curvature of the windscreen and the size of the
    lettering. Small type is okay, even with quite a bit of curvature. Lareg type
    on a lot of curvature needs some compensation.\r\n\r\nBest advice: make a mock
    up and see it in place. "

  body: "I assume you're asking if it should be curved so that it appears straight
    after application, right?\r\n\r\nYou need to do a test, like Bert suggested. Make
    a full-sized mockup using an unmodified logo, tape it in place, and see if any
    adjustment is needed.  \r\n\r\nIf it turns out that you do need to curve it, it
    might take several tests to get it right.\r\n"
