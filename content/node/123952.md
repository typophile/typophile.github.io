    the hand-drawn look. I checked https://creativemarket.com/search/fonts/spurs/1
    but did not spot a match. Perhaps it is not tagged \"spurs.\"\r\nYou mentioned
    Taranatiritza. I prefer the rendering by HiH as Gothic Tuscan One\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GothicTuscanOneAsFEETBACK_3789.gif]
