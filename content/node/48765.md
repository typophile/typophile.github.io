  trying to make a vector so we can stop making these horrid grainy print outs. The
  thing that is driving me batty is the 3, 0 and the d and b in feedback. They appear
  to be some form of futura but I can pin down which futura was used.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/star_360_feedback_logo_6024.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  have seen that ATFutura Maxi Light looks close but still not perfect.\r\n\r\nAny
  Ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nDan"
