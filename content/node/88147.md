  the year 1965. I am attaching sample photos from the text of the journal as well
  as uploading a paper from that year (some of you will recognize it as one of the
  seminal papers on the density functional theory) on Scribd at http://goo.gl/lus0g
  (the file attachment feature here was not working at the time of this posting).\r\n\r\nI
  have tried the automated WhatTheFont tool, but it did  not yield any meaningful
  results. All your help will be greatly appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot-1_6362.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot-2_5702.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot-3_3917.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot-4_4769.png]"
