body: "I\u2019ve spent days browsing my type bookmarks in search of a display typeface
  for the magazine I\u2019m redesigning, but so far nothing feels quite right. The
  magazine writes about pop culture, and the readers are mostly students (18+). \r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  excited to finally find a good project for Feijoa, and I think pairing it with this
  sans of my own works quite good. I also intend to use the sans for pull quotes and
  some (smaller) display as well, but for headlines I\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t
  have the necessary punch. Unfortunately Feijoa\u2019s own display cut is way to
  feminine for this project.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text_3964.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/display_6590.png]\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  having a hard time explaining just what I\u2019m looking for, but I\u2019ll give
  it a go:\r\n\u2022 It needs to relate to the other typefaces somehow. (Not overly
  humanist, not too geometric)\r\n\u2022 Stylistic alternates is a plus.\r\n\u2022
  I think a heavy weight would be useful. (Until now, the main display font have been
  The Mix Black.)\r\n\u2022 They write a lot of serious articles on philosophy and
  ethics in addition to the cultural stuff, so it can\u2019t be too funky or childish.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?"

    being by the same designer (I thought I'd seen them successfully paired somewhere,
    but can't find that again \u2013 and I don't have Feijoa, so I can't say for sure).
    It's pretty similar to yours in feeling and seems to fit your description quite
    nicely \u2013 it has all the things you mention (like an alternate \"g\", which
    has saved me at least once).\r\nBut that would probably mean not using your font,
    as they're sort of close from what I can tell."

    well. Thing is, I think the heavy weights of National is just a little to funky."

    a heavy display weight last night, and I think I might polish is up a bit and
    stick with it."
