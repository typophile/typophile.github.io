    looks like it\u2019s done with a typewriter, so it could well be that there even

  body: "Good call, Don, looking into Orator I found Orator 10 (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/orator-10/),
    wich appears a bit wider, thus a slightly better match for the letters. Then I
    checked again the article from which the image is taken (there's a picture of
    a dashboard with an IBM logo on it... I was looking for a pun ;-) and noticed
    this:\r\n<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Heather, in the comments to this
    post, has correctly identified this font as Manifold from the <a href=\"http://munk.org/typecast/2013/11/03/dsg-ibm-selectric-type-element-catalog-type-styles/\">DSG
    IBM Selectric Type Element Catalog</a>.</p></blockquote>"

  body: "I agree Riccardo, Manifold it is. \r\nUnfortunately we are stuck with having
    only the Orator digital versions. I suppose the easiest way to mimic Manifold
    is to expand the width of Orator, perhaps by something over 120% and, if a closer
    match is desired, modify a few characters, such as _G_, _Q_, _@_, _$_, and _&_.
    Also some revision of the vertical alignment of the various numbers.\r\nDon"

    for reference comparison if you want to fine tune Orator to make something like
