  body: "Many Criterion DVD covers were done by [[http://www.kellerhouse.com|Kellerhouse
    Inc.]]. May be it's one of their many artworks using some bespoke typeface as
    they're well-known for.\r\nLooks like they artificially emboldened by adding an
    outline stroke to some Signum-like (thanks Don) font and reworked counters.\r\nBTW,
    following Don's previous modification guidelines, some more alternatives even
    if Trump Gothic is a nice find: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mendoza-vergara/proteina|Proteina]],

  body: "The original movie titles from 1949 were quite different.\r\nhttp://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-third-man/\r\nI
    suspect that this is a modern font used by Criterion for its re-issue.\r\nSome
    similarity to Georg Trump\u2019s  Signum, digitized as by Canada Type as Trump
    Gothic <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/trump-gothic/\">Trump
    Gothic</a>, but much heavier in weight and the crossbars on E and H as well as
    the bottom of the bowl on R are too low. Or perhaps it's just artwork.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"
