body: "I've been renaming and regenerating for days now. The problem I have is that
  Roman typefaces and their italics appear under different font menus even though
  the family name is exactly the same (see pic). How can I sort this and have them
  all appear under the same menu? I have spent enough time going round in circles
  getting nowhere. Why are there so many options in FontLab and no definitive solution
  to generating an OTF family in a range of weights?\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated.
  Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fontmenu_4695.gif]"

    be counted as a second family with what looked like the same name. Fixing the
    fonts did not fix the problem; I found that the only way to fix it was to stop
    using the fonts via a font manager and instead put them in /Library/Application

    sharpest knife in the box.\r\n\r\n1. Select all the code and save it in a text
    file (I use TextMate on a mac).\r\n2. Name the file something with .py at the
    end, I use NamingMacro.py\r\n3. Put this file into your macros folder, on a mac
    thats - /Users/Username/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros\r\n4.
    In FontLab open the macros toolbar    View - Toolbars - Macro.\r\n5. The file
    you put in the macros folder should be there, select it and press run.\r\n6. A
    window will open asking you for the family name then one for the weight.\r\n7.
    Done."
