  stems? I'm imagining and sketching letters that have that feature. A better example
  is the h/n/y here:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_5797.gif]\r\n\r\nIt's
  obviously a handwriting-like cursive feature, but has anybody tried to make a more
  formal, regular sans with that kind of branching?\r\n\r\nI can see the first problem
  I'd run up against is cloggy spots where the strokes are doubled up. That would
  involve some serious thinning of the monoline treatment of the rest, or some other
  solution. Maybe a horizontal spreading of the strokes, as we see in the vertices
  of capital M's in some sans that almost look like IVI."

  body: Yes, Flora is nearly exactly what I had in mind as far as the branching goes.
    I wonder if the forward-moving "cursivity" of the branching basically requires
    the italic slope, or if it would work with vertical strokes.

  body: I've been sketching but haven't gotten to scanning any of it yet. I have aspirations
    of making something more useful than a "novelty face." (But maybe that's how most
    novelty faces start! :-) )

    solution would make it for an effective text typeface but I\u2019d be happy to
    be wrong: in fact, that would be a very original solution, if you could make it
    work. Good luck!"

  body: To add another answer to my own question, looks like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/eaglefeather/informal/|Eaglefeather
    Informal]] has this branching, and is upright. (Actually it's one of many "architectural"
    scripts that have this, but its lowercase is closer to the formalized font I'm
    envisioning that others.)
