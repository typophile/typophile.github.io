body: I'm working on a wordmark that leads out with the word "flying" and I love the
  look of a descender on the f. So far I've only found this on Verlag italics, which
  are lovely but are also quite pricey. Can you think of any others?

  body: '[[https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/fedra_sans|Fedra Sans]] is the first thing
    I think of. But isn''t customizing any geometric sans /f/ to descend something
    that any good wordmark designer should be able to do him- or herself?'

    perhaps overly worried I will do something clumsy and upset the aesthetics/proportions
    of the face. But maybe this isn't a big deal for such a small change?\r\n\r\nLovely
    suggestions, thank you! I hadn't looked at Anivers in a while but it is compelling.
    Fedra Sans is also quite nice. (I love the italic f in Sensibility too but the
    overall look isn't right.)"
