body: "It's grotesk!\r\n\r\nFive hours isn't enough time to measure anything or work
  out the spacing properly. I worked by eye, nothing was measured. Helvetica is pretty
  easy to draw. Ellipses and sticks. Make the inside ellipse very small, then once
  you've made a simple l and v it's over. You'll be blatting bugs before breakfast.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bugset_3573.gif]\r\n\r\nBug
  Blatter only looks good with tight spacing to match the interior spaces. I like
  how c and C come out. z is knackered. There's a lot of cheating going on with stroke
  width and counter position.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bug1_5981.gif]\r\n\r\nRay
  Larabie's type design axiom: \"If you work on a font long enough it will turn into
  Helvetica\"\r\n\r\nI'm sure somebody has already done this, going by this magazine
  cover:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/life_apollo_9_6586.jpg]\r\n\r\nI didn't
  fake that. Honestly, It's real. Can anyone identify the font used?\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm
  too busy with other stuff to draw any more of Bug Blatter. :^) that's good in a
  way.\r\n\r\nNo plans to market it or proposition Linotype/Monotype about adding
  it to Helvetica, but what do people think?\r\n\r\n* Would you use it, and what for?\r\n*
  I figure it would be okay for paperback covers, t-shirts, signage, logos and some
  kinds of magazine design. It would make good laser-cut perspex letters, 2 inches
  thick, say.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moonsuit_5653.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  looks much better with negative tracking:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jpcrow_3510.jpg]\r\n\r\nAll

    like the painting mentioned in the first line, you should yank the Beziers to
    make it a bit more superelliptical. This will fill in the negative space in the
    \"corners\" of the round letters. It's that mega-ultra-friggin-bold paradox we
    discussed back in the days when I Kayoed* something. All that bold-meat has to
    come from somewhere. The other thing you can do is start cranking the x-height
    more. So, if you scale the lowercase up a smidge and reduce the weight on the
    stems or whatever-the-hell-else you feel like reducing, you'll have a pleasingly
    plump version of a famously dull Swiss font.\r\n\r\n*kayo is an extreme-mega-ultra-black
    where the priorities are weight gain and maintaining the silhouette of the svelties."

  body: ' . . . oh and those overshoots. Tell you what. Here''s what we''re gonna
    do. Scale up that lowercase about 5%. Arrow key bap ''em around so the x-height
    is high and the overshoots are nice. Then just make sure the lowercase stems are
    about 8% narrower that the caps or they''ll look eighties/Meta-ish.'

  body: "Ah, thanks for ID'ing that Mark.\r\n\r\nRay,\r\nIt's like painting a fat
    Jesus alright. (much laughter) It's a work of everweight orthodoxy. Possibly this
    is a sub-conscious attempt to depict the gluttony and sloth, the moral corruption
    of the higher-ups within the church.\r\n\r\nCheese sounds great. I was thinking
    of putting an inline in there but that's a lot more work. But the cheese theme
    could be done with minimal pain by adding circles inside the letter bodies and
    half circles on the edges so it looks half-munched.\r\n\r\nAslo try: luring fat
    hunks of cheese into an enormous wicker basket and torching it.\r\n\r\nThe overshoots
    are all over the place. It could take on more more x-height for sure.\r\n\r\nMore
    superelliptical, mmmm...\r\n\r\nJelmar,\r\nthe detailth maketh Helvetica apart
    from Arial. Hellvetica hath no fury.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone. I'll try to work
    on this s'more later in the week, weather permitting.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    --- typeface design does not make sense. If you think that it does then quite
    possibly you are taking type design too seriously. Type design as handed down
    to us by the 16th century Venetians is only <em>meant</em> to make sense, but
    the rules and conventions are rather illogical and convoluted.\r\n\r\nj a m e
