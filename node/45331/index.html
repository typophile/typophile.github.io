  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve got a question for those doing or knowing book design&hellip;</p>
<p>I noticed, that when I&rsquo;m reading a book that I sometimes &lsquo;miss&rsquo; the last word of a paragraph when it is alone on a single line at the and of the last paragraph. (Of course, this mostly happens when I&rsquo;m a bit distracted or otherwise not fully concentrating on what I&rsquo;m reading.)  I&rsquo;m not talking about widows and orphans, rather something like this</p>
<p>&hellip; (bottom of recto) &hellip;
Slowly he slid toward the door, pressing him-
self more and more into the wall, into the dark, 
away from his enemy. Would this door save his 
hide?
[turn page to continue on next verso]
&hellip; next paragraph&hellip;</p>
<p>Thus, I would visually skip or miss the word &ldquo;hide&rdquo;, then turn the page to read on and think &ldquo;hey, there was something missing from that last sentence&rdquo; only to turn back the page and discover that I had missed the last line.</p>
<p>Two questions:
Is this something that is so common that there is some term for it? (No, I don&rsquo;t mean ADS ;)
In case this is common, do some book designers take care about justifying paragraphs in a way that prevents this. E.g. making sure that there are a few more words on the last line of a paragraph when it ends on a recto so it has more visual weight and isn&rsquo;t missed by distracted dorks like myself?</p>

<p>All book typographers take care in avoiding that. Lesser designers can make that mistake, and it very much is an error to not adjust your way out of that situation.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Do you know whether applications such as InDesign or Quark can do this automatically (either as a build in feature or with 3rd party plugins)? It seems to be in the same similar complexity category as the widow/orphan control features that everybody supports. However, I have not seen this yet but I just might not have looked in the right places. Especially as I don&rsquo;t know the terminology for &ldquo;lone word at end of paragraph. <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/41152">This thread here on Typophile</a> suggests that those loners may be called widows after all. Or &ldquo;runts&rdquo; or &ldquo;stragglers&rdquo;.
The fact that I usually see them in cheap books could be a hint that most software can&rsquo;t handle those automatically. Or that the switch one has to turn on to handle them automatically is hidden away so that those cheap-book-peddlers can&rsquo;t afford to find it ;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In all my decades in book work, I have never heard it stated as a general rule that a single word in the last line of a paragraph is a bad thing. Not even in the last line of a page.</p>
<p>When you do leave a single word on that last line, it is a good idea to make sure that single word is longer than the ¶ indent on the following line.</p>
<p>I also try to avoid breaking the last word of any paragraph, so there will not be some kind of &ldquo;non-word&rdquo; on the last line. In well-designed and well-set books, the word &ldquo;hide&rdquo; in Lars&rsquo;s example would most likely be longer than the ¶ indent.</p>
<p>I might make an exception were I told by a publisher that a book I was designing/setting was to be aimed at an audience of people who were not highly skilled readers.</p>
<p>&amp; I&rsquo;ve never been involved in the production of &ldquo;cheap books&rdquo; (unless you are making a value judgement about the content). In fact, I&rsquo;ve set plenty of ¶s like that in really expensive books. So that argument holds no water, at least when I&rsquo;m in the room.</p>
<p>If people are missing words such as Lars&rsquo;s &ldquo;hide,&rdquo; they are reading too fast. Slow down, savor the text, get involved with it. You&rsquo;ll miss fewer words.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for sharing the insight. I agree, slowing down helps. It doesn&rsquo;t happen that often but I find it really interesting to hear about this from a book design perspective.</p>
<p>It may also be a question of reading technique. At work, I often have to read large amounts of text rather fast in order to get an overview of some material. And in order to do that I try to read words in clusters rather then single words. Thus, if there is no cluster for my eyes to latch on to, I may miss something. This is OK when doing the kind of scanning and skimming I talked about.</p>
<p>Will, what you wrote reminds me that I need to actively remember to get out of that mode when I&rsquo;m &ldquo;really&rdquo; reading.</p>
<p>Thanks again,
Lars</p>
