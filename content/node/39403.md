  you think Dems are as haunted  by \"losing\" the 2004 logo campaign as the comic

  body: "I\u2019ve talked about poor design in the Democratic party with Democratic
    campaign strategists, and they know that design is a big problem for most campaigns.
    Some of them have tried to get their clients to bring in better designers, and
    Blue State Digital has made huge improvements on the web, but too much of their
    design still stinks. Given how many great designers are liberal Democrats it shouldn\u2019t
    be that way, but the Democrats are still really lagging behind Republicans when
    it comes to campaigning.\r\n\r\nI do like the Obama, logo, tho. Sure it\u2019s
    a little over the top, but in a campaign season when a mutant like Kucinich is
    allowed into the debates, it takes a lot to stand out."

  body: I'd have expected something like this to have come in a publication for graphic
    designers. That it came in NYT is quite a comment on its readers.
