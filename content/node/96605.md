  body: "It seems modified, as I've tried all Baskerville variants I can find.\r\n\r\nThe
    tail on the 'J' for example... on the photo it doesn't come as low as standard
    Baskerville, which leads me to believe it's either some variant I do not possess
    or it was modified/customized before use.\r\n\r\nEither way, thanks for all the
    help guys  -  really appreciate your time!    :)\r\n\r\nSteve"

    don't see any Baskervilles that match that."
