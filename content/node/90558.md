    the ascenders... The very few you\r\nwill find will have caps that are either
    unusually\r\nnarrow or unusually light (strokes of thickness not\r\nmuch more
    than the lc, unlike in your design). Does\r\nLedger have smallcaps? If not, try
    setting some text\r\nwith acronyms (like \"NASA\") and see how they totally\r\nruin
    the texture by jumping out...\r\n\r\nBTW, I just noticed another big problem related\r\nto
    vertical proportions: your descenders seem to\r\nbe longer than the ascenders;
    they're supposed\r\nto be shorter - and this isn't dogma, there's a\r\nvery practical
    reason: descenders are far less\r\nfrequent than ascenders in actual text; giving\r\nthem
    more (or even equal) room basically wastes\r\nvertical space.\r\n\r\nIn fact the
    claim that Ledger has a large x-height\r\ndoes not seem to be true. That's not
    necessarily bad\r\nnews, since when it's too large readability suffers.\r\n\r\nSo
    here's the shortest path I can think of to fix the\r\ntwo vertical proportion
    issues: make the ascenders\r\ntaller. If that makes the x-height too small for
    you,\r\nthen you have much more work on your hands...\r\n\r\nConcerning Richard's
    onscreen angle: it's certainly\r\ntrue that the lower fidelity of the screen can
    hide\r\na number of flaws... but fixing them won't make your\r\nscreen rendering
    worse! It will simply give better\r\nresults when somebody prints with your font.
    And if\r\nanybody sets Ledger at a larger size onscreen* then\r\nit benefits there

  body: "Denis, first of all, this typeface does show a lot of finish and I can see
    you put a great deal of work into it. Now to evaluate: the proportions of your
    ascenders and descenders really <em>are</em> way out of wack, you have to see
    it for what it is. How much consideration did you put into those proportions?
    I had made a similar mistake with my proportions for Neuton, which I have attempted
    to correct in later versions.\r\n\r\nThe ascenders are much too short. Being at
    cap height, unless done extremely well, makes the illusion that the ascenders
    are actually <em>lower</em> than the capitals. It can work, but only rarely. I
    recommend you raise the ascenders at least as much as the height of the serifs.\r\n\r\nThe
    descenders are also too low, especially in comparison with the ascenders. I would
    consider moving the descenders up enough to achieve more unity in form. The top
    stroke of the loop of the /g/ probably wants to rest on the baseline.\r\n\r\nI
    hope what I've said helps you. Also note that it's really not too late to make
    a correction such as this, considering the nature of Google fonts: 1) The approach
    tends to lead toward progressive development, so little improvements are welcomed
    and encouraged. 2) People already using the font will get all of those little
    improvements automatically. You should be able to adjust the ascenders and descenders
    relatively easily. As long as you make sure not to change the body size of the
    font (which should already be bigger than the height of ascenders & descenders
    to account for accent marks), there will be no reflow of text. :)\r\n\r\nOne final
    note, you should reconsider your /r/ a bit\u2014there's a large gap on the bottom
    right. I would recommend shortening the length of the arm and making the bottom
    right stem serif a little longer. :)\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n"

    for many typographic situations. Also there are a lot of other differences and
    this is clearly not a straight-up Melior copy, but a new interesting work. Some
    of the caps are a little heavy, which you might want to address, however this
    is a common trait of the Didone classification, which Ledger borders on. You just
    might want to unify the weight of some of the caps, for instance the /L/ looks
    a whole lot lighter than the /R/. :)

  body: Perhaps this might be a work-alike substitute for Melior or an "inspired by,"
    but there are numerous distinctive features which make it very hard to argue it's
    derivative.  There is no resemblance whatever between the two fonts' UC Q.  The
    tail of the LC e in Melior is a rounded widening; Ledger has a hook-like terminus,
    almost a serif.  The bowl of Melior's LC a shoots straight back; Ledger's droops.  The
    spur on the LC p and b is pointed; the equivalent part of Melior's letters stick
    straight back.  The 3s don't match at all, Legdger's 6 has a different width,
    the angle of the 7 downstrokes don't match.  The crossbar on Ledger's UC A is
    much lower.  (I hadn't run out of differences when I got tired of comparing.)  They're
    both the Latin alphabet, yes; but they're no more similar than hundreds of other
    distinct faces in any big vendor's catalog.  Looks to me like Ledger is shaping
    up as a fine-looking face.  I don't have suggestions for improvements, but it
    seems there are obvious reasons to challenge the charge of derivative work.

  body: Richard (rememberbooks), your argument that it is totally unlike Melior based
    on details doesn't make sense. It was because of the initial impression and overall
    feel that one makes the connection with Melior. My font Neuton is similar to Times
    New Roman, but the details are totally different. Yet it still gives an initial
    impression of Times. Honestly there are reasons one would use Ledger over Melior,
    or vice-versa.

    name: rememberbooks
  body: "We are really much closer to saying many of the same things than your reply
    suggests.  First, I thought I had pretty clearly indicated in my earlier and shorter
    post (1) that many different Latin fonts resemble (my \"catalog\" remark), and
    (2) that as a possible \"work-alike\" or \"inspired by\" face, Ledger certainly
    does give an overall page impression more comparable to Melior, certainly less
    than to Century Schoolbook, ITC Garamond, Storm Lido, or any Didone.   So, I never
    said or tried to imply that Ledger was totally unlike Melior, quite the opposite.
    \  Are you with me so far?  We both agree the two faces resemble.   Same opinion.
    \ You say my reasons for stating they don't resemble \"don't make sense,\" but
    I was not suggesting they don't resemble.  I was making a different point entirely
    ...\r\n\r\nSecond, my main point is that overall page impression does not in any
    way support calling it a derivative work.  Nick's original post did not use that
    term, but his follow-up 29 Feb 2012 \u2014 12:55pm did.   Correct me if I'm wrong,
    but doesn't \"derivative\" mean the designer basically started with one design,
    made changes, and ended with the other?  (To clarify, I'm not talking about illegally
    copying code, only working from an image or impression of a pre-existing design.
    \ The details I cited strongly suggest to me that this designer started from scratch,
    not that he began with some Melior-like drawings and adapted that alphabet.  We
    may agree on that, too.)\r\n\r\nNow, the overall impact of his glyphs may have
    ended up resembling Melior, and that is entirely fine.  That doesn't make them
    derivative.  Their not being derivative is  my whole point, my only point.  That
    the details support.  I wouldn't have commented but for the use of that word,
    and the fact that he said such derivative work \"calls for opprobirum.\"  Had
    he only said \"similar to \" or \"evocative of\" or \"kind of like,\" there'd
    have been no issue.  You even seem to say something similar with your statement,
    \"Honestly there are reasons one would use Ledger over Melior, or vice-versa,\"
    too.   So, again, it appears we agree rather than differ.  I hope you don't think
    it's right to condemn a designer or a typeface because it somewhat resembles another.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    having hopefully clarified those things on which we seem to have agreed, I believe
    my points in support of what I said do make sense.  If your own font, which you
    say \"gives an initial impression of Times,\" is not a \"derivative\" face which
    \"calls for opprobrium,\" then it seems you would now also agree my reasons for
    not calling Ledger derivative make sense, too.    I would expect you to rightfully
    object if someone said your face Neutron was an adaptation of Times, or a derivative
    of Times, simply because the two alphabets resemble.  I'm certain you don't believe
    you or your font should be condemned because it resembles Times in some ways.\r\n\r\nI've
    got no dog in this hunt.   I love staring at good type; but I definitely don't
    have the skills to design a font.  I probably don't even have the skills to digitize
    one which had been beautifully drawn by a competent artist and handed to me on
    a platter.  I don't mean to make my remarks personal, only to clearly call for
    clarity.   I thought I made a worthwhile, on-topic point, reasonably.   I still
    do.  But if that didn't happen, I'll let it drop.  There's bound to be something
    more valuable to do."
