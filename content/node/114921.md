  body: The designer may have added the chiseled effect to a plain condensed sans-serif
    font using a vector illustration program. It wouldn't be hard, since the designer
    would only have to make the <strong>E</strong> and <strong>D</strong>, and then
    modify the <strong>E</strong> to make the <strong>L</strong>. If I were doing
    this, I'd soften the edge of the shadow at the lower curve of the <strong>D</strong>.
