  body: One would have thought that an interest in fonts & typography would to some
    extent go well with a grasp of grammar and spelling... Don't mean to be insulting
    but you badly need a spellchecker, or this country's education has gone to the
    dogs; or both.

  body: Maybe message an admin to remove it for you. A good size for these forums
    is 550 px wide. Or you can attach a pdf to your original post.

  body: "You can upload a PDF. I can't speak for others, but I usually don't click
    on too many PDFs. Ideally, you'd upload a smaller gif/png file and if you want,
    a PDF for those that want to check out the details.\r\n\r\nAlso, I really don't
    think you need a gigantic copyright watermark on this. "
