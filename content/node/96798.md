body: "The Kickstarter project [[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1496420787/endangered-alphabets-ii-saving-languages-in-bangla|Endangered
  Alphabets II: Saving Languages in Bangladesh]] might be of interest here.\r\n\r\nIn
  short, their aim is to record the Indic alphabets used by the indigenous languages
  spoken in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Southern Bangladesh, such as Mro, Marma,
  Tripura, and Chakma. The project creator Tim Brookes will carve signs using these
  alphabets for his Endangered Alphabets exhibition, and a typographer and a calligrapher
  will collaborate to produce typefaces that can be used to print children's schoolbooks
  in these languages.\r\n\r\nThe project description page is somewhat vague about
  just how endangered these scripts and languages are and what the current situation
  is, so I've drawn up a quick background about the four languages mentioned.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mru_language|Mro]]
  is considered \"definitely endangered\" by UNESCO, with around 50,000 speakers in
  Bangladesh and Burma. The [[http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n3589.pdf|proposal
  for encoding the Mro script]] seems to be still in the Unicode pipeline at this
  stage.\r\n\r\nThe [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marma_people|Marma people]] numbering
  around 210,000 are Arakanese (Rakhine) descendants living in Bangladesh, and therefore
  speak a form of the Arakanese (Rakhine) language, which is itself a form of Burmese,
  written with the Burmese script. I couldn't find any mention of a separate alphabet
  for the Marma people.\r\n\r\n\"Tripura\" seems to be referring to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokborok|Kokborok]],
  an official language in the Indian state of Tripura. Only around a tenth of the
  800,000 total speakers of Kokborok are in Bangladesh. Kokborok was once written
  in its own script called Koloma, but this has disappeared and it has been written
  in the Bengali script since the 19th century. The Latin alphabet was also introduced
  later, and both Bengali and Latin are used today, with the choice of script a highly
  politicized issue. I couldn't find any information on the situation in Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nThe
  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakma_language|Chakma language]] has around 700,000
  total speakers in India, Bangladesh, and Burma, with around 310,000 in Bangladesh.
  The Indian state of Tripura announced in 2012 the introduction of Chakma language
  in primary schools. The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakma_script|Chakma script]]
  was added to Unicode 6.1 in January 2012.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, only two of the four
  languages mentioned (Mro and Chakma) have their own scripts currently in use. The
  other two are written with Burmese (Marma) and Bengali or Latin (Tripura), which
  as scripts are not particularly endangered. Nevertheless, there may be variants
  of these scripts particular to these languages as used in Bangladesh, just as there
  are different variants of the Latin, Cyrillic, or Arabic alphabets depending on
  the different languages that use them. Mro is by far the most endangered of these
  languages; the other languages each surpass Icelandic in total speakers, for comparison,
  although it has to be pointed out they are not officially recognized in Bangladesh
  and are threatened by the official national language of Bengali, which is understood
  by 98% of the population."

    still suggest adding some images of the scripts to your Kickstarter page. I\u2019d
    like to <em>see</em> what this is all about. \r\n\r\nA note: A typographer is

    in reply to Hrant: It's hard to tell from the snippets of info on the internet,
    but the Koloma script for Kokborok is said to have \"disappeared\", which may
    mean that there are no extant examples of the script and we only know that such
    a script existed. In that case, it would be impossible to revive, unfortunately."

    also thought the Hebrew langauge (which was dormant* for a very long time**) was
    \"impossible to revive\"... although I admit that the tenacity of the Hebrew <em>script</em>
    probably helped there. Really though, if Kokborok is still alive reviving Koloma
    would be that much easier. Build it, and they will come - make the font, and use
    it - remember Mesrop Mashtots!\r\n\r\n* In fact an <em>idea</em> (which is what

  body: But how can you revive a script without knowing what it looked like? I gathered
    that no examples of the script may have survived (the chronicles of the Borok
    kings were supposedly written in Kokborok in the Koloma script, but we only know
    about the later Sanskrit translation). In that case, the Koloma script would be
    irretrievably forgotten.

  body: "Of course you're right about that. How old do you think the most recent Koloma
    inscription would be? In the case of Armenian we don't know exactly how Mesrop
    Mashtots designed our alphabet, but we do have inscriptions from about a century
    afterwards (beginning of the 7th century) and lucky for us it was never interrupted.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Further searches have indicated that indeed the script is believed to be lost,
