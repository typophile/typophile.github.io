body: Dose Magazine is a daily newspaper here in Toronto, and they use a variety of
  different typefaces (and quite well, I think.) One font I can't identify is the
  main sans serif font used in the majority of the magazine (in body text, etc.) It's
  hard to see the features in a small point, but the May 25 edition used it quite
  prominently on the cover (as attached below.) I've tried to use Identifont to identify
  it, but none of the results have the slanted ends that this has. Any ideas?
