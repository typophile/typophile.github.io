  body: ' hmm...kinda reminds me of an oldstyle digital clock mixed with a garage
    font...I think you have the right idea in trying to use a &#34;building block&#34;
    in order to create a modular type of font, but it seems like you have lost patience
    in a few cases, namely in the &#34;B&#34; &#40;looks more like an &#34;8&#34;&#41;,
    the &#34;D&#34; &#40;you should try something besides skewing it&#41;, the &#34;J&#34;
    &#40;using an inverted &#34;L&#34; is a little bit easy&#41; and the &#34;R&#34;
    &#40;the terminal on the stroke is not quite what it should be...&#41;. I&#39;m
    talking about the &#34;soft&#34; version here. You seem to have a better way of
    handling italic though. I especially like your &#34;N&#34; and &#34;O&#34; in
    the &#34;hellacious&#34; version, they are very well balanced. Some of the other
    letters could use a bit of breathing space in their counters. <BR>I think you
    have a good idea, but it needs some refinement. Maybe you could try introducing
    another building block, a similar shape but used differently, or maybe something
    really unexpected that would add a whole different flavour to the font. Or sometimes
    it helps to have a smaller building block, so you can have a more diversified
    grid to play with. <BR>In any case, keep on it! I wanna see the numerals! '
