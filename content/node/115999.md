  of the time, switching to Optical looks much better to me and it's usually pretty
  different, even with Adobe or HF+J fonts. However, I know foundries carefully work
  out the pairing spacing, so I never know if I'm just wrong when I switch to Optical."

    to near perfection. On the other hand, there are nice looking fonts out there
    that have worthless kerning and these will benefit from using this Adobe feature
    (based on a theory of David Kindersley, if I am not mistaken \u2014 viz: http://www.kindersleyworkshop.co.uk/spacing/
    ).\r\n\r\nBTW  I do wish Adobe would include in InDesign etcetera a feature from
    QuarkXPress (\u2026used to have, maybe, because I left QXP behind when ID 1.5
    came out): the opportunity to define global tracking (as Quark called it) for
    specific sizes. As you should know smaller sizes need more tracking than larger
    ones.\r\n\r\nMore info here: http://www.graphics.com/article-old/design-fundamentals-kerning-and-tracking"
