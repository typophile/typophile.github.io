  Hopi, Navajo, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nIf you make a general word list (language unknown)
  and avoid certain letter pairings as hyphenation points, not many choices remain
  -- for example, ngw, ngy, ky, kw etc. are single letters in Hopi, and ay, aw, iw,
  iy, etc. are dipthongs.\r\n\r\nBut it occurs to me -- why can't you always break
  at a glottal stop? there is a pause in pronunciation there anyway. Did a quick search
  & found nothing either way.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nCharles"

  body: Take care. While English speakers tend to think of a glottal stop as a 'pause
    in pronunciation', it is actually just another consonant sound, and in some languages
    it may appear in a pre-vocalic position, i.e. at the beginning of a syllable and
    even, as in Arabic, at the beginning of a word. Presuming you are aiming to hyphenate
    between syllables, you need to understand how the glottal stop is used in the
    languages you are setting and whether a glottal stop ever begins a syllable. If
    it doesn't, then you should be safe to hyphenate after the glottal stop.
