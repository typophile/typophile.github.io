  body: Luka,  <BR> <BR>1. The functionality you&#39;re proposing does NOT belong
    into the OpenType layout features of a font. Each language has different conventions
    when inserting quotation marks. English uses quotedblleft and quotedblright, German
    uses quotedblbase and quotedblleft, Polish uses quotedblbase and quotedblright
    etc.  <BR> <BR>2. The &#34;liga&#34; feature is NOT for putting typographic quotation
    marks. It&#39;s intended for ligatures.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch

  body: Hi Adam, <BR>thanks for inforamtion. <BR>Thing is, Im doing all I can to avoid
    cumbersam and tedious manual changing in page design. <BR>I got some material
    in text format with &#34;straight&#34; double quotes that needs replacing with
    curly quotes. One way to do it is inside page layout app like Indesign with search/replace
    command, but it will replace them with either quotedblleft or quotedblright glyph
    not both. So i&#39;m trying somehow avoid that manual tweaking which is unavoidable
    in the end i guess. <BR> <BR>sorry for long post <BR>cheers,

  body: Luka,  <BR> <BR>When you import the text into InDesign, there is an option
    to replace straight quotes by typographic quotes. InDesign will do it automatically.  <BR>

  body: Another problem with what Luka was trying to do, at a technical level, is
    that he was trying to replace two glyphs with two glyphs. As I recall, OpenType
    does not directly support many-to-many substitutions. One has to use contextual
    substitutions to get an equivalent effect. <BR> <BR>&#40;There are, btw, good
    reasons for this. Many-to-many substitutions tend to obscure the mapping from
    characters to glyphs, among other things.&#41; <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    designing a font using Fontlab. But the problem I have is that the context-dependent
    features (like 'mset') dont work, while all the features of the font work properly
    in the generated final font.\r\nDo you know why this happens and how I can make
    the 'mset' feature work?\r\n"
