  his awesome (work in progress) software. This application could add serifs and manipulate
  them as well as font weight and x-height so easily it left me breathless. Just with
  a click.\r\nThe thing is, I absolutely cannot remember the website address. Or the
  name of the projecy. Or anything useful to try a search on google.\r\nI hope someone
  here has heard of it!\r\nTx"

  body: "Very cool!\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of the philosophy behind the Computer Modern
    family of TeX fame (or infamy, if you've read a few too many research papers set
    in it!), where the METAFONT source files are governed by 62 parameters controlling
    various widths and heights and so forth. I seem to recall reading that Knuth et
    al. even made the serif, sans and monospace all derived from the same basic structure,
    simply by changing around the parameters to delete serifs and make all widths
    equal.\r\n\r\nAwesome to see such a concept presented in an interactive, real-time
    manner."

  body: "\"about time\"?\r\n\r\nI think it is a safe bet you are unfamiliar with Ares
    FontChameleon. Over 15 years old now, and was very much along these lines in its
    capabilities.\r\n\r\n(Adobe bought Ares because its compact \"font descriptors\"
    could be used to cram more fonts into limited printer ROM space, back in the day.
    FontChameleon-compressed ROM fonts were a standard feature of PostScript 3 when
    it first shipped, though I believe Adobe eventually abandoned the technology for
    new devices. I found it much more interesting for its original purposes, myself!)"

    modification toolkit off the market. I learned something new today.

  body: "Yes, that was a common assumption in the usual retail markets, but no, it
    was all about PostScript font compression. The type group was relatively uninvolved
    in the decision except in the aftermath of helping proof the new fonts and to
    some degree sorting out some of the end-to-end implementation issues.\r\n\r\nFrom
    a fonty perspective, PostScript 3 in 1997 was a bit of a \u201Cperfect storm.\u201D
    Adobe changed a bunch of things relating to fonts all at the same time: ROM fonts
    having to be coordinated with TrueType fonts and not just Type 1, supporting CE
    encoded fonts (both TT and T1), and the Chameleon (Type 14) font compression format
    in ROM. All these things interacted, and even if some seemed fine by themselves,
    the implementations had to be compatible....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
