  now, I have found three main options, as showed in the image.\r\n\r\nAny other idea?
  Comments?\r\n\r\nRegarding GOOD DOG NEW, I would like something as readable and
  handwritten, not too childish, but with more weights. Alternatives?\r\n\r\nThanks,
  Paolo\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_request_3538.png]"
