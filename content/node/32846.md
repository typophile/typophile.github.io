    by the way, for those keeping score, HF&J's Cyclone is a wonderful font, able
    to communicate a variety of moods with surprising versatility. It sets like a
    charm too. Every word looks like a jewel. Man those Hoefler kids really know how
    to do it. \r\n"

  body: "You're right Georg, Phosphor and Red Rooster's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/phosphate-rr/\">'Phosphate'</a>
    are almost exact copies of the Erbar typeface. Letraset's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/follies/\">'Follies'</a>
    is modified more, but still quite similar. However, the '!' mark sets the 'identical'
    ones apart from the Erbar design, and Michael seems right about 'Phosphor' being
    the answer this time.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
