  Lipatti album is a box set containing an 8-page brochure printed photogravure on
  a thick, intense cream-coloured stock.\r\n\r\nThere were several more Angel covers
  credited to \u201CAtelier Cassandre\u201D, all of remarkable quality.\r\nWere these
  the work of Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron, a.k.a. Cassandre, the famous poster artist
  and type designer?\r\nIf so, he would have been in his \uFB01fties at the time."

  body: Cost of the target web design service should be the last thing that a person
    should look at. It makes no sense for a person to spend all his money in a single
    project and end in financial problems. When hiring a web site development company,
    always make sure that the cost of services offered lies within your financial
    confines. Having a budget to monitor personal spending could be of great help.
    Nonetheless, if running on a tight budget, comparing the rates offered by different
    companies could help get the most favorable deal in the market.

  body: "Garage sale pick-up?\r\n\r\nI don't readily see a similar design style of
    these jackets with that of the poster artist Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron.  The first
    image of your second post, the Emile Gilels jacket, does seem to have the somewhat
    of the same sense of 'humor/drama' that could of come from Adolphe Jean-Marie
    Mouron tho.\r\n\r\nDunno.\r\n\r\nAll the jackets seem like they would of come
    from a garden variety in-house designer/illustrator because they all look systematic
    in their standardize pattern background typographic foreground. In that regard
    these lack the recognizable Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron rich dramatic style ...
    Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron took chances.\r\n\r\nIf these were done by him, I'm
    guessing he would of had a battle with the creative director ...lol. \r\n\r\nThat
    illustration of guy stompin' round the women is hilarious!\r\n\r\nFor what it's
    worth I'm thinking those jackets were done by three separate in-house designers/illustrators...\r\n\r\nn."

    unlikely he kept the same style.\r\nLook how Tschichold went classical post-war.\r\nChances?\u2014these
    are pretty outrageous (especially for classical music covers), and so deft:\r\n\r\nThe
    way the Brahms names are surprinted on top of each other, on top of the ruled
    background, with no knockouts.\r\nThe Lupatti design with the enormous type ornament
    border, reversed out of a mid-tone sage and grey.\r\nThe overlapping letters in
    the Gilels cover\u2014presaging Cassandre\u2019s YSL logo?\r\nThe \uFB02atness
    of the tension between text and images playing against the faux perspective in
    the Supp\xE9.\r\nThese are all masterful graphic ideas. "

  body: "Saul Bass didn\u2019t do the lettering (which contributes so much of the
    personality) for all his masterful graphics.\r\n\r\nI would certainly agree with
    Nick that the output of the \u201CAtelier Cassandre\u201D is not the sole work
    of the boss (just like a lot of typefaces that are more art directed than drawn
    by their designer).\r\n\r\nI just wondered whether he did these himself.\r\n\r\nI
    disagree that they are generic, they are exquisite examples of spot color process
    graphics (although the Oistrakh is a bit \uFB02at, literally, in its imitation
    of a tipped-on photo).\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t get them in a garage sale, but have
    acquired them over time, many from vinyl record stores. These Angel covers really
    stand out from all the other stuff in the bins, particularly for the quality of
    printing, on thick uncoated stock. As well as \u201CAtelier Cassandre\u201D, there
    is an equal credit line for \u201CEditions Mercure\u201D \u2014 the famous French
    publishing house, and presumably printer. So I would assume the front covers were
    printed in France and shipped to the UK where they were assembled\u2014and then
    exported to North America &c.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re right Chris, they are great recordings.\r\nThe
    Gilels G Minor Concerto is the best I\u2019ve heard of it by a long shot.\r\nI
    also have a slightly later (1961) Bernstein/Gould version, highly touted, but
    which just murders the Andante. It does have a great cover though, shot by Avedon,
    which really dates the Cassandre designs as being 1950s.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leonard_bernstein_beeth_6055.jpg]"
