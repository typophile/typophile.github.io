  We're pretty set on the mark, but the type needs work.\r\n\r\nWe don't really have
  a big budget at this point, so something in the $0 to $40 range would be nice, but
  not required.\r\n\r\nThe .pdf contains both horizontal and vertical versions. We'll
  probably be using the vertical version more often, but the horizontal at small sizes.\r\n\r\nThis
  is the horizontal version:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/apartment32logo_4311.png]\r\n\r\n

    a long one there {if you know what I mean ;)} I'm immediately thinking of using
    a complimentary tall 'face such as Linotype Univers. It's out of your budget,
    but perhaps someone could set it for you for a reasonable fee? Then again, this
    might be a great opportunity, considering your budget, for a custom-designed type
    job! Might be a great exercise, matching a custom face to your icon. Moreover,
    what could you do to mesh the two (icon and typeface)? Something to consider.\r\n\r\nDylan

    I've got the Bitstream version of Univers (Zurich) which is what this is set in.

    too high on the horizontal version, I would also slightly increase the size of

    the type could you get away with just the numerals or maybe make the type two

    does it have something to do with the placement of your office, if not, and it

    could be at the very top floor, the penthouse if you like, always associated with

    to the mark and raised so the baseline is aligned with the top of the window instead
    of the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe third is the same as the second, with the baseline aligned
    to the bottom of the mark.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the light, you'll notice that there

    we don't read buildings the same way we read roman script. The convention is that
    apartment number 1 will be on the first floor, and 10 on the tenth floor (if there's
    only one unit per floor). Anyway, this is not the biggest issue in my opinion.
    If after considering the options you decide that being on the ground floor, metaphorically
    speaking, is a good thing, that's what matters most."

  body: When I first saw it I was confused because I thought the light was on in apt.
    4 as well (apt. 32 being the top rightmost room), So i changed the logo to put
    the light where apt. 32 seemed like it should be, and it didnt seem to do good
    things graphically. I'd suggest you keep the light on the bottom. It seems like
    metaphorically it works either way, and your office is on the bottom. Plus, having
    the light on the bottom makes it easy to notice (2nd window, 3rd floor is really
    confusing to look for), and grounds the whole logo. If you put it in the far upper
    right it makes the building look like its going to tip over. (to me at least).

    32 should be rather on the top floor than on the ground floor but i understand
    your justification due to the general reading habit.. \r\n\r\nhave you considered
    making the other windows rather grey than white? it would symbolise that everbody's

    that your eye starts at the top anyways and travels natually downward, which would
