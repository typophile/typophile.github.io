body: "Firstly, thanks to everyone who gave me input on this logo & sign design.  I
  took your advice and am a lot happier with the result...I hope you all like it,
  too.  The first image is of the original idea and the last is our sign design including
  logo.  I think part of my problem was that I was hung up on the sign rather than
  the logo itself, simply because in real estate, the sign is what you see the most
  (well, we hope so anyway!)  Once I worked through that, things became much easier.\r\n\r\nOriginal
  idea:\r\nhttp://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m132/slvonb/taketwo.jpg\r\n\r\nSomewhere
  in the middle:\r\nhttp://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m132/slvonb/takethreesigncopy.jpg\r\n\r\nEnd
  result:\r\nhttp://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m132/slvonb/nth-degree-sign.jpg\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nI've
  placed the order for the signs...now I just need to find someone to print some inexpensive
  corrugated plastic signs to use until the real signs come in.  If anyone knows of
  a company, I'd love some suggestions.\r\n\r\nAnd mostly...just thanks.  : )  You
  guys were pretty nice to me, the non-designer wanting free advice!"

    I can't suggest a local printer for you, try googling DTM (direct to media) or
    screenprinters and your town/city, DTM will probably be cheaper, less set-up required.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "It's nice, but if it's a yard sign, I'd really rework it so the URL is much
    larger. When driving by houses for sale that I'm interested in, I'm less interested
    in the logo on the sign and more interested in trying to remember how to look
    up the web site when I get home to find out more about the house.\r\n"
