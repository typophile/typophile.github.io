  body: What do you mean by a 'UK barcode'? For mail? For product packaging? What
    are you going to use the barcode for? There are several internationally accepted,
    standardized barcode formats. I'm thinking that one of them may be what you're
    after.

  body: There are a lot of solutions for Barcoding, eg standalone programs that make
    them for you. If you're on a Mac do a search at versiontracker.com with 'barcode'
    and you'll find the lot (even freeware!).

    Their site is a bit hard to look at, but they do know their stuff about barcodes.
