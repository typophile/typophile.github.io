  body: "I would use the arrow only in one letter (P would be my choice), is there
    a specific reason why you are using it in the P&R? What happens when the arrow
    in the R is looking leftwards? Also try to enclose the arrow(s). Or rotate them
    45 degrees in order to symbolize success. Maybe using two colors, one for Pro
    and one for Resource would make it more vibrant. Over all, I think it needs a
    little bit more playing around. Do you have other drafts? Meta is a solid typeface,
    what about using a roman typeface? \r\nTracking is to tight...\r\n\r\nDerya\r\n\r\nP.S.
    another possible use of the arrow symbol (DIN Pro Light):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Parrow_6244.jpg]"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply!\r\n\r\nThe client wanted the capital P and
    R so the P with an arrow alone looks a little unbalanced. Having it break through
    the letter is intended to symbolise progress and moving forward, I did try having
    it enclosed but it lookd a little bit static or even stuck, and having one arrow
    facing the other looked a little confrontational or antagonistic.\r\n\r\nTo be
    honest the client has already approved the design I was just wondering what other
    people thought. I'm not too sure about the tracking though, I wanted it to be
    quite tight but I will look into it...\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    the information, if so, that the client has approved the design. I thought you
    are in the working process.\" Just wondering\" is in my eyes a meagre motivation
    for posting your logo.\r\n\r\nDerya"

  body: 'A more squarish typeface might go better with your arrows. For example, <a
    href="http://processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html">Klavika</a>.
    That would work also as a corporate face with a contemporary look. Another possibility
    is <a href="http://vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/">Apex New</a>,
    which also has a serif mate.  '

  body: "Basically the arrow is a strong sharp edged shape that may annoy the eye
    while it is scanning the logotype. If you have to use it, I would recommend to
    make it smaller in size, and more slim. I would also increase the tracking to
    give more air for the eye too; for same reason. \r\n\r\n\r\nA."

  body: I agree with Derya in that the arrow should be used with only one letter.
    Using the arrow twice focuses too much attention to the gimmick in my opinion.
