  am using InDesign - \r\nthe top line is letterspaced 10, while the bottom is letterspaced
  -33.\r\ni did this to line up the outsides of the top and bottom lines, but since
  both are letterspaced differently, it feels unbalanced.\r\n\r\nwhat would you suggest
  i do? \r\n\r\nincidentally, this is the client's preferred type treatment, not mine.\r\n\r\nthanks

    fonts that can tell and do so much more for that book cover. No offense, but it
    looks like your client only has Helvetica and Times Roman on their machine - and
    so that is what they use.\r\n\r\nCouldn't you take some time and actually design
    a cover marrying the type to the cover art and present that to your client?"

  body: "<em>i\u2019m not sure it really feels appropriate to me. </em>\r\n\r\nThe
    original brush lettering, and its size, made the whole cover look like a parody.\r\nHowever,
    now you still have parody proportions, but as you say, that doesn't look right
    with the mod font.\r\nSo perhaps you need to do something to put some more semantic
    contrast between the setting style and the picture style, to clearly signal that
    this is not a parody. Perhaps something as simple as knocking the type out of
    a bar that bleeds off to the right."

    designed on the wooden board... (It looks, well, designed!) When placed on one
    line below the title looks like the designer was saying, \"I don't know where
    to place it.\"\r\n\r\nSorry - but it really is difficult to tell the difference
    when casually looking at Helvetica Neue Thin 35 and Chateau Paris 1960. Take a
    look for yourself.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chateau_6123.gif]"

  body: "thanks again everyone for your comments!\r\n\r\nnick - i see what you mean
    about the original design looking like a parody. my take on the book was that
    the publisher was interested in this for its kitsch value. the majority of the
    illustrations throughout are of the \"so bad it's good\" variety. it wasn't until
    yesterday that i was informed of the intention to position the book in a 'museum'
    context.\r\n\r\njackie - i too liked the original placement of the introduction
    name better and agree that now it feels like i didn't know where else to put it
    (which is pretty much true).  i sent a few more comps based on nick's suggestions,
    but the client still prefers the lowercase chalet version. so, i guess that is
    it.\r\n\r\n"

      since the title will be set in uppercase, do we think i should go with miss

    look fine is for MEXICAN - make if a few point sizes larger so it fills the space.\r\n\r\nIf
    you look at the sample I posted on Hel 35 and Chalet -- you'll see that's what
    was done.\r\n\r\nAnd please, don't forget to Kern!!!!\r\n\r\nGood Luck.\r\n\r\nAnd
    it is always difficult to tell a client back off. Last year, in the middle of
    an ad campaign for one of my clients, I was pulling my hair out. Hours upon hours
    doing one ad for one local paper. Even after approval and shipped off, more changes.
    I reminded him that he hired me to do a job, and he had definitely turned down
    a wrong path. (Not something a client always wants to hear.)  I was fine with
    that, however, he sent me a nasty note with a check. I put it aside to look at
    on a \"clear\" day\u2014and never got around to it. Six months later, he was back,
    apologetic and replaced the check I never cashed. We work very well together now.
    Maybe 1/2 hr. to put the ad together, I send him home to his wife with it, and
    even though he'll call with a change an hour later, I don't talk to him. I make
    him sleep on the job and contact me with ALL changes the next day. It works, we
    get along very well now. It is not a friendship, but a working business relationship.\r\n\r\nIt
    is really okay to remind a client that you are the designer and you were hired
    to do your job. You created your work listening to all the input the client has
    given you. It is time for the client to decide which direction, and if too wishy-washy,
    it is probably time for you to speak  up. \r\n\r\nAnd of course, find yourself
    a replacement for them...that is, if they are driving you insane!"

  body: "I wonder where your client got the idea that this kind of typeface and setting
    would seduce the museum store crowd. I ran a museum bookshop for a long time,
    and the Chalet/Helvetica is not what I would think would grab the customers for
    this book. It drains the energy from the subject-matter. The type looks like it
    has accidentally slipped off the cover of another book, say one on 1960s architecture,
    and is now wondering what it's doing in the land of Mexican kitsch. And I agree
    with Patty\u2014go with something more meaty, more energetic, like your original
    design. The title deserves it."
