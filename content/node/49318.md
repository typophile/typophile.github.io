body: "Adobe is looking for some feedback from the font developer community on how
  you want the AFDKO/FontLab/FontMaster code syntax to work for OpenType mark attachment.
  Please comment! Comments received by Friday September 29th will be most likely to
  influence our implementation.\r\n\r\nDetails and our initial suggested syntax are
  on my blog here:\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/09/afdko_mark_attachment.html\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: "Thomas,\r\n\r\nI've always made up glyphs & used ccmp to access them, so
    I have no experience with mark. But we have a different work situation than most
    font *designers/developers*, and I can see why using the mark feature is attractive.\r\n\r\nThe
    SIL fonts seem to use the mark feature extensively, esp. the newer Gentium Book.
    I imagine you've already looked at SIL's work . . .\r\n\r\nFWIW"
