    gives a lot of information about the sourcing of the pictorial elements in his

    Cormac McCarthy or Sedaris ones?"

  body: "The McCarthy font looks like a Bodoni, but it is strange in having a very
    high flat-topped t. It also seems somewhat condensed. I thought Torino might come
    close, but the details seem wrong. Monotype's Bodoni seems closest in the top
    of the t, but the book uses a stretched looking (customized) form of Bodoni, in
    my opinion.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The Crichton sans serif is a condensed grotesk of some kind, and there were
    hundreds of condensed sans faces in the old film type collections (in the Solotype
    Catalog with G-names). The closest current digital font I could find that matched
    the shapes of the G, R, M, C  and (almost) the S was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/preusstype/neue-steinschrift/|Neue
    Steinschrift]] from preussTYPE. It's a little heavier, but the letterforms are
    very close.\r\n\r\n  - Mike Yanega"
