body: I&#39;m designing a CD-cover and need your critique on the simple logotype I&#39;m
  planning to put as a part of the cover. Here&#39;s a rough sketch. The blue background
  is the sky of the cover photo. Does the logo work OK? What should I change? Any
  specific problems? <BR> <BR>&#40;and yes, the &#34;hurriganes&#34; is spelled correctly
  and &#34;the&#34; is missing in the sentence... Finnish band Hurriganes was notorious
  about their bad english<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: '&#34;Rough sketch&#34; sure looks different than what I call a &#34;rough
    sketch&#34;. I really like the type design, however, music is very emotional making
    it hard for me to critique its appropriateness without knowing much about Adam.
    I guess the only thing I would say &#40;and many might disagree with me&#41; is
    that the sliver of the &#34;M&#34; strokes seems to be crossing the baseline too
    far. It probably wouldn&#39;t bother me so much if the &#34;A&#34; below it wasn&#39;t
    so close. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

  body: really like the adam logo, however theier are some real problems with teh
    kerning on teh words &#39;A TRIBUTE TO HURRIGANES&#39; you might want to half
    the word spacing and double the letter spacing. I have no problem with the M droping
    below the baseline but agree that the second line needs some breathing space

  body: I did not even notice the thing going on with the M, I&#39;ll propably fix
    it in the final version. Strange how blind one can get when judging his own work!
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll also try out Paul&#39;s tips om kerning and spacing. <BR> <BR>Thank
    you both very much! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'RE: &#34;M&#34; <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t worry about stopping the point right
    at the baseline...I just think it&#39;s crossing a little too much right now.
    <BR> <BR>RE: Kerning/Letter Spacing <BR> <BR>Any changes here should probably
    be pretty conservative. I think the look of the logo demands some fairly tight
    type, so I would follow Paul&#39;s suggestion, but do so conservatively. <BR>

  body: i like the tight letterspacing on the tagline. but it&#39;s true that the
    word spacing is too large.  bring the words closer, i say.  you might want to
    bring that tagline down too, farther away from ADAM. <BR> <BR>also, i think the
    A in ADAM should be the same distance to the D as the other A is to the M. &#40;what
    i mean is the vertical blue lines there aren&#39;t the same width, but they should
    be identical.

  body: It seems appropriate that the cresent shaped space between the &#34;D&#34;
    and &#34;A&#34; should &#34;appear&#34; even from top to bottom. In order to achieve
    this visual equal spacing &#40;I say &#34;visual&#34; because the &#34;literal&#34;
    spacing is probably even, as is&#41; the open space probably needs to flare out
    just a tad at the top and bottom. <BR> <BR>Also, Loren is on the money regarding
    the vertical space between the A&#39;s and their adjacent consonants. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: Jan keep the first M&#39;s sliver it stands out nicely and gives a bit of
    depth. You are designing a logo, not a type face.

  body: I&#39;ll have to disagree. There&#39;s no reason for the &#34;M&#34; to stand
    out, in fact, I think it would detract from where the logo has gone &#40;latest
    version&#41;. Also, did Jan say that he wasn&#39;t designing a typeface? <BR>

  body: I think the bottom phrase is far too close for both the word spacing of that
    line and the letterspacing of the above. I also prefer the darker blue. But, BUT,
    until we see the whole thing in context we might be giving you the wrong critique.  <BR>

    the logo? I agree with Tiffany lets see it in context. Dan

  body: That spacing between teh words is still very unconfortable to look at, and
    emphasised when the strapline is butted so close to the Mark. <BR>I&#39;m also
    not a great fan of hte Bauhouse light font as it make shte whole identity look
    dated &#40;unless your going for the retro look? this comment is tmade completely
    out of context of where the Bands Image sits... is it to be a Pulp-esque retor
    typographical treatment?&#41;. I also agree with tiffany that the darker, greyer
    blue feels better, again this has no real context just an aesthetic feeling.

  body: Well on the last version there is no room for the large M&#39;s sliver, and
    finally the desition of keeping it or not has to do with a lot of things only
    Jan is capable to evaluate.  <BR> <BR>I feel that M is a bit constrained, it
