  these logos. I am trying to re-make a copy of 1 of these logos so that vinyl cutting
  software can vector the image properly (at the moment the software goes a bit haywire
  and doesnt trace the image correctly)\r\nThe logo was originally designed by a friend,
  but I am currently unable to get a hold of him to ask him what the font is, so if
  anybody can identify the font it would be very much appreciated.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adrenaline
