  body: "Why do you need to use FontLab? If you already have all of the weights and
    widths, they will show up in groups of 4 in your font menu. There is no way to
    get around the 4 unit family limit if that is your question. If you don't have
    all of the weights and widths you want, then you can't do it anyway. Even if Berthold's
    EULA allowed it, there is no simple way. You have to draw every letter in every
    weight and width.  This would take you many months if you are experienced. If
    you have never done it though, you are in for a real treat. It is far easier to
    just buy the family. Besides, Berthold's lawyers are quick to pursue infringements
    on their company's work.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    you are violating the EULA.\" Can you please elaborate how you arrive at this
    conclusion without knowing which EULA actually governs the gardenize\u2019s license?
    \r\n\r\nThe current Berthold EULA (http://www.bertholdtypes.com/info/agreement.html
    ) includes the following provision: <em>\u201CYOU FURTHER AGREE THAT YOU WILL
    NOT REVERSE ENGINEER, DECOMPILE, DECRYPT, DISASSEMBLE, NOR SEEK TO DISCOVER THE
    SOURCE CODE OF THE FONT SOFTWARE. (...) Notwithstanding, if applicable law in
    your jurisdiction permits you to decompile the Font Software, then you may only
    do so to achieve operability of the Font Software with another software program
    provided that you first request in writing that Berthold provide the information
    necessary to achieve such operability and Berthold has not made such information
    available to you subject to reasonable conditions.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nHowever,
    this EULA only applies to Berthold fonts purchased from the U.S.-based Berthold
    Types Ltd., Berthold Direct Corp. or their distributors. It does not apply to
    Berthold fonts purchased from the Berlin-based H Berthold AG (which sold these
    fonts years ago) nor to Berthold fonts purchased from Adobe Systems (e.g. as part
    of the Font Folio package in versions earlier than 9, or individually when Adobe
    was still selling Berthold fonts in the past). Those fonts have their own EULAs
    that do not necessarily prohibit reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling
    or seeking to discover the source code of the font software. \r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    in some countries, the law permits to decompile software programs under particular
    circumstances. For example, Article 6 of the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?val=172880:cs&lang=en&list=172880:cs,&pos=1&page=1&nbl=1&pgs=10&hwords=&checktexte=checkbox&visu=#texte\">EU
    directive of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs (91/250/EEC)</a>
    permits decompilation of software programs without authorization of the rightholder
    for the purpose of obtaining the information necessary to achieve the interoperability
    of an independently created computer program with other programs if the information
    necessary to achieve interoperability has not previously been readily available
    to the licensees. Discovering the source code of computer fonts using some software
    tools may often be the only way to examine if a given aspect of a particular computer
    font (e.g. encoding, glyph naming, family naming, hinting etc.) is compatible
    with the particular software application we use. \r\n\r\nFinally, opening a computer
    font in a font editor such as FontLab Studio does not necessarily constitute reverse
    engineering, decompiling, decrypting or disassembling font software. FontLab Studio
    does not necessarily display the source code of a computer program included in
    a computer font file. For example, FontLab Studio never displays the source code
    of hinting, and depending on the settings, it may or may not display a decompiled
    code of the OpenType Layout tables. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I think your statement
    that \"if you are opening the font in Fontlab you are violating the EULA\" is
    overly simplistic and generalizing. It all depends on how you open the font (using
    what settings), where (geographically) you open it, when you do it and what EULA
    applies to the font. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    this person's request, when people are asking about reconfiguring a font and the
    EULA does not permit such to be done, one shouldn't do it. \r\n\r\nIf I read your
    post correctly--boy I hate lawyer speak, am I alone?--then this request still
    isn't covered by the EU directive because they are about reconfiguring. No?\r\n\r\nYou
    are right though, I shouldn't generalize. I should point them to the EULA and
    say \"good luck\". ;^)\r\n\r\nFontLab isn't the bad guy and I certainly don't
    mean for it to come across that way. "

    of \"interoperability\" is, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nAgain, a couple of lessons: you
    need to know what EULAs your fonts have attached to them, and, secondly, don't
    patronize foundries that seek to restrict modifications!"

  body: "There is a difference between modification and decompilation. Just opening
    a font in FontLab Studio might *at most* constitute decompilation/reverse engineering.
    Modifying the font and generating a derivative work is a different thing. If a
    EULA does not permit that, you're most likely not allowed to do it. Unless of
    course your legislation allows you to ignore such a provision in the EULA for
    whatever reasons (there may be many). \r\n\r\nFor example, in Germany, customer
    protection legislation allows the end-user to disregard \"unreasonable\" terms
    if the license agreement was was not made apparent to the customer in a clear
    way. \r\n\r\nFor example, recently, a German court anulled a sales deal made on
    a website that was designed so that the button \"I agree\" was placed within the
    area that was at once visible on screen while the pricing information was placed
    down below so it would require the user to scroll down. \r\n\r\nIf a font vendor
    does not make sure that his EULA is very apparently made part of the purchase
    process (so that the end-user has to notice it), then some or all terms of the
    EULA may end up not being binding to the user -- at least in countries that enjoy
    strong customer protection such as in the E.U.  \r\n\r\nOf course, it would be
    up to a court to decide if a EULA clause is deemed \"unreasonable\" or not. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
