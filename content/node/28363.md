  CS2 the actual DPI-value of my screen, so it displays an object that is 10cm wide
  as 10cm in 100% Zoom. At the Moment, I have to zoom to about 130% to get an 1:1
  equivalent, which is not very handy...\r\n\r\nI remember Xpress 4.0, where this
  was possible, so maybe Indesign can do it as well? Changing the DPI-value on system
  level (Windows) doesn't seem to change anyting.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\nSebastian"

    that does that.

    that these easiest solution is to hold a ruler up to the screen, and then adjust
    the zoom until it's 1 to 1. \r\n\r\nAt that point, I don't know if InDesign can
    'save' a zoom as a preference or not. "

  body: While I'd be interested in such a shortcut myself, obviously it would still
    only provide a rough idea of what you'll get when you spit the document out as
    a hardcopy. Even with a hi-res display and your text-rendering engine tuned right
    up, you're still looking at clumsy pixels on the screen, thus your display will
    never provide a decent representation of good crisp ink (or even half-assed toner
    for that matter).

  body: "Thanks for the script, garyw. Adjusting, installing and giving a shortcut
    to it, it does the job pretty well. Though it's still not logical that I have
    to zoom to 131% to get a 100% view :)\r\nSo listen Adobe: CS3... feature-request...
    hear the users... you know...\r\n\r\naluminium: of course your're right. And this
    happens just to me, who is preaching everyone the meaning of dpi, ppi, lpi, pixel,
    resolution, etc.\r\n\r\njason: it's useful to judge proportions, compare to hardcopies,
    etc. Of course, for typographic details, it's quite useless."

    for software to really know what it needs to size it at on-screen.\r\n\r\nRumour
    has it that OSX.5 will finally have resolution-independant screen rendering:\r\n\r\nhttp://mnteractive.com/archive/resolution-independance-in-osx-leopard/\r\n\r\nIt's
    been a long time coming, so I'm hoping it happens."

      asked where I can enter my PPI-Value I calculated for my screen, because then,
      the software knows what it should do. It works in Xpress and Acrobat 7, and
      I was looking for the same thing in Indesign.\r\n\r\nBut it's okay anyway...
      It works, so logic is secondary."
