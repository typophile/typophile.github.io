  body: i&#39;m not sure how to post images here. but i mean architect-drawn style.
    the examples i have are from an old basic technical drawing book by spencer dygdon.
    it would look like hand-drawn letters from old draftsman blue prints...

  body: You could try searching MyFonts using keywords such as &#34;architect&#34;
    or &#34;drafting.&#34; For example, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=architect&amp;itemsperpage=57&amp;resultcount=57&amp;page=1">here&#39;s
    a search for &#34;architect.&#34;</a> <BR> <BR>Just ignore the part where it says
    &#34;Tekton.&#34;

  body: <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html">Gotham</a> is
    a great typeface with a lot of this flavor, though it doesn&#39;t look hand-drawn.

    is a good candidate for drafting illustrations. <BR> <BR>The sample looks almost
    like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/lh-extended/"
    target="_blank">Trade Gothic Extended</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/burin-sans/"

  body: yes. you are right. Gotham does have similar qualities but without the quaintness
    of traditional hand-drawn lettering found here. as i understand, Gotham draws
    its inspiration from the 20s street signage of suburban New York and Chicago.
    <BR> <BR>your recommendation does help however. thank you. the others faces, like
    Tekton, Stylus and Graphite do have architectural and technical flavors but not
    quite the distinctive aesthetics of the ones in the example.

  body: House Industries&#39; Neutraface Drafting is very nice. too nice as a matter
    of fact. it is a comparable choice however. the lettering from the sample does
    have Trade Gothic Extended qualities.  <BR> <BR>you&#39;ve all gave me enough
    to go on. thank you. if down the road, anyone finds a perfect match of the sample,
    please let me know. perhaps, this would be a good project for a type designer
    to revive in digital form.
