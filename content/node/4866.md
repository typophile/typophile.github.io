body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got a typeface I&#39;m working with that was designed
  at 100 em units. For Flash to render it properly as dynamic text, I&#39;ve been
  told that the typeface needs to change to 125 em units. I own FontLab 4.6, but cannot
  figure out from the manual how to do this. I would rather not have to redraw the
  typeface, do any of you have any suggestions for me? I appreciate it.  <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: Open the Font Info window. Go to the &#39;Metric and Dimensions&#39; panel.
    Change the UPM to 125 and select the &#39;Scale all glyphs according to UPM change&#39;
    option. <BR> <BR>Note that changing the UPM will destroy TrueType hints. Also
    note that scaling from 100 to 125 will produce rounding errors.

  body: John, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the comment. That was the first thing I tried -
    when I opened the typeface in FontLab, it had a UPM of 1000, so I changed it to
    1250 with the scale option enabled. It didn&#39;t work out. Maybe if I scale it
    from 1000 down to 100 then up to 125?
