  body: I would recommend [[http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/jubilat|Jubilat]],
    it has 3 different "forms" for some of the characters, and definitely has a Clarendon
    flavor.

  body: Including Italic versions and Bold variations, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/belizio/">Belizio</a>
    from FontBureau is probably the closest and most complete alternative to Clarendon.
