body: "This post really should be in &#34;Build&#34;, but for some reason I&#39;m
  not allowed to start a topic there. News to me. Anyway ... <BR> <BR>Hi everyone,
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for a little bit of advice on a handwriting font I&#39;m
  currently working on. The font uses contextual substitution to &#34;flip&#34; through
  a series of alternates for each glyph, much like LettError&#39;s Kosmik, if you&#39;re
  familiar with that. Instead of three variations of each letter, there are nine,
  but the idea is the same: a kind of controlled randomness &#40;which really isn&#39;t
  random at all&#41;. <BR> <BR>In addition to the nine variations of each letter,
  some letters have up to three initial forms and/or up to three final forms. There
  are also quite a few ligatures, which themselves may have initial and final forms.
  The ligatures are always constructed of only two letters, no more. <BR> <BR>One
  last detail about the design of the font: it is unicase, so I&#39;m converting all
  uppercase input to lowercase, for simplicity. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Skip
  down to the next section if you already know how Kosmik works &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;
  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s how it works: <BR> <BR>First I ask the font to convert all of
  the letter combinations that will &#42;always&#42; result in a ligature &#40;that
  is, there are at least nine variations of that ligature&#41;. These combinations
  are: en, er, ju, on, or, te, th, tt. This is contained in the &#39;liga&#39; feature.
  <BR> <BR>Then I ask the font to begin swapping alternates, using the &#39;calt&#39;
  feature. Each glyph belongs to a class of glyphs. There are nine alternates of each
  letter, so each of the nine glyphs gets put into a separate class. All of the &#34;default&#34;
  glyphs get put in the &#34;SET_ZERO&#34; class; all of the glyphs ending in &#34;.alt1&#34;
  get put into the &#34;SET_ONE&#34; class; glyphs ending in &#34;.alt2&#34; are put
  in the &#34;SET_TWO&#34; class, and so forth. <BR> <BR>My &#39;calt&#39; feature
  says this: <BR> <BR># first, get rid of all that nasty uppercase stuff <BR>\tsub
  @UPPERCASE by @LOWERCASE; <BR> <BR># then use the same method that Kosmik uses to
  &#34;flip&#34; through classes glyphs <BR>\tsub @SET_ZERO @SET_ZERO&#39; by @SET_ONE;
  <BR>\tsub @SET_ONE @SET_ZERO&#39; by @SET_TWO; <BR>\tsub @SET_TWO @SET_ZERO&#39;
  by @SET_THREE; <BR>\tsub @SET_THREE @SET_ZERO&#39; by @SET_FOUR; <BR>\tsub @SET_FOUR
  @SET_ZERO&#39; by @SET_FIVE; <BR>\tsub @SET_FIVE @SET_ZERO&#39; by @SET_SIX; <BR>\tsub
  @SET_SIX @SET_ZERO&#39; by @SET_SEVEN; <BR>\tsub @SET_SEVEN @SET_ZERO&#39; by @SET_EIGHT;
  <BR> <BR>So, if a user types &#34;mmmmm&#34;, they will actually get &#34;m m.alt1
  m.alt2 m.alt3 m.alt4&#34;. This should be nothing new to many of you. <BR> <BR>Please
  note that the line: <BR>\tsub @SET_EIGHT @SET_ZERO&#39; by @SET_ZERO; <BR>is omitted,
  because returning to the original set is understood implicitly. <BR> <BR>Every time
  the user types a glyph, the font looks back at the last glyph, figures out what
  class it belongs to, and uses that information to determine which variant of the
  next glyph to place down &#40;at least, that&#39;s how I think of it&#41;. Even
  the space character is included in this merry-go-round &#40;yes, there are nine
  variations of the space character&#41;. That way, typing &#34;yes yes yes&#34; won&#39;t
  result in the same three glyphs appearing over and over. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;
  This is the next section, welcome back &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Thanks for
  your patience if you&#39;ve gotten this far. Now I&#39;ll try to describe some of
  the issues I&#39;ve run across. <BR> <BR>In order for the flipping to work correctly,
  every single glyph needs to belong to one of the nine classes &#40;SET_ZERO through
  SET_EIGHT&#41;. That way, when the next letter is layed down, the font knows which
  version to use by looking at the class of the last glyph. If there were a glyph
  that ended up on the page which did not belong to any of the nine classes, the next
  glyph would have no point of reference, and would default to the first variant of
  that letter. This could have the inconceivably catastrophic effect of the same glyph
  appearing twice within a relatively small proximity!!!! AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!! <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
  something I&#39;d like to avoid. The problem is that not all of the ligatures have
  nine variations. I have a &#34;tz&#34; ligature that only exists in one form. I
  can easily write a lookup that says, &#34;whenever an &#39;a.alt5&#39; is followed
  by a &#39;t.alt6&#39; and then a &#39;z.alt7&#39;, replace the &#39;t&#39; and &#39;z&#39;
  with &#39;t_z&#39;, unless it&#39;s at the end of a word&#34;. And so forth. These
  specific cases are tedious, but simple to write, as shown in the Bickham Script
  feature file that Adobe released recently. <BR> <BR>But! The &#34;tz&#34; ligature
  must belong to one of the nine classes so the flipping can continue undisturbed.
  But there is only &#42;one&#42; &#34;tz&#34; ligature, and the classes used for
  flipping must each contain the same number of glyphs, or flipping is not allowed!
  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s the same case for initial and final forms: not all letters have
  three of each, but the glyphs all have to belong to a specific class, and the classes
  cannot have different numbers of glyphs contained within them. <BR> <BR>One way
  to simplify things would be to create the same number of alternates, initials, and
  finals for every single letter that can be typed with this font. That would eliminate
  the need to worry about differing numbers of alternates and specifying certain cases
  where they can and cannot appear. However, this is a handwriting font created from
  an actual handwriting sample, and making lots of extra letters and ligatures that
  are convincing is a non-trivial task. I&#39;m willing to do it, if there isn&#39;t
  a way of resolving these issues with OT features. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m hoping to work
  out all the OT features &#42;before&#42; cleaning up the auto-traced characters
  and tidying up the font, so right now the font is just a cesspool of mismatched
  character shapes and sizes and weights, with an external text file serving as my
  underground mad-scientist OT laboratory. <BR> <BR>If anyone has any insight, I would
  greatly appreciate it. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Alan"

  body: hmmm, i&#39;m in no means an expert at this, but here&#39;s a bit of code
    i wrote trying to do something similar, except i only had 2 alternates for lower
    case letters that switched off with eachother. <BR> <BR>feature calt { <BR>  sub
    @class0 @class0&#39; by @class1; <BR>  sub @class1 @class1&#39; by @class0; <BR>  sub
    @class0 space @class0&#39; by @class1; <BR>  sub @class1 space @class1&#39; by
    @class0; <BR>  sub @class0 space @UC @class0&#39; by @class1; <BR>  sub @class1
    space @UC @class1&#39; by @class0; <BR>} calt; <BR> <BR>one thing in here is that
    i didn&#39;t make 2 variations of the space character, but wrote code to &#34;skip
    over&#34; the space character. This should work for your t_z lig too just make
    a class of characters that only have one form and place them in the code above
    where it says &#34;space&#34;. But it&#39;s late and maybe that won&#39;t really
    work... <BR>Also, it&#39;s too late for me to think this through, but what happens
    if you put the t_z lig in every set? <BR>okay, i&#39;ll go to bed and let the
    pros sort out the confusion i caused in the morning. nite!

  body: If that t_z lig is the only problem glyph, you could always have 9 different
    versions of it. Sure, they all &#42;look&#42; the same, but that would make the
    substitutions work cleanly. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Yes, I could make 9 versions of the t_z, but that is one of 30-some ligatures
    that don&#39;t have 9 versions yet. So that&#39;s a bit of added work, and on
    a philosophical level it&#39;s not ideal for what I&#39;m doing. But I think that&#39;s
    a very reasonable suggestion, and would save my brain a bit of work, if not my
    hands. <BR> <BR>As for including the t_z and other ligatures in every glyph class,
    I don&#39;t really think that would work. The OT font is not saying, &#34;does
    t_z belong to SET_FOUR? ... yes&#34;. It&#39;s saying, &#34;which class does t_z
    belong to? ... um, all of them?&#34; So I don&#39;t think that will be the best
    solution in this case. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your feedback!
