    never with that of people who clearly couldn't care less about type itself.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is not with your stance. I pretty much agree with you. Your posts about
    outline theft, pirated copies, and rip-offs are well taken. Mostly your posts
    are directed at a few people in IDing contests who are not as passionate as you
    in the sourcing or origin of the fonts.\r\n\r\nYou've made your point to them
    many, many times. Don't you think they understand your point by now? Will saying
    the same thing to the same people over and over again produce different results?\r\n\r\nAlso
    you are shifting the burden to the IDers to make sure they're naming a legitimate
    copy. Why don't you do a little checking before disparaging fonts and IDers? Why
    don't you start a list of illegitimate fonts? And more than once innocent posters
    looking for an ID, some newcomers, got caught in the crossfire.\r\n\r\nI'd just
    like someone with your knowledge and passion to take the rant out of Hrant. Don't
    give up your principles; just give up being a nag that just incurs the ire of
    others. And who wants to see a thread about a font ID with more posts about (il)legitmacy
    (real or imagined)  than about the font itself?"
