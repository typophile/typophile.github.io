body: "Hello, my name is Joshua and I am a student.  This is my first type attempt
  at designing a typeface.  \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate any comments on what
  is working and what's not.  \r\n\r\nAlso, to test the font I have been generating
  the font file in Fontographer, importing into Font explorer to activate and test
  in Illustrator.  Does anyone have a better way of testing the font?  Every time
  I update I have to delete the old file or rename the new one to see the updated
  version. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJ"

    are nice too even if the square looking holes or counters worry me slightly. The
    work reminds me Of Rudolph Koch woodcut blackletter \r\n\r\n& this: http://www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/Detail.htm?pid=204549\r\n\r\nIn
    some cases you are letting the 'rules' that are helping you build your style &
    the letters get in the way of more ideal forms. the s & a look that way to me.
    The f seems to need the most help. Do you see what I mean? Congradulations on
    a very good 1st draft!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree with your comment about the square looking holes and counters Big
    E. I also noticed a trend of inside left edges were kept perpendicular and very
    straight, where the inside right edge was broken up or curved. I'd suggest trying
    keep that trend going with all your letters. Adding a slight curve to the holes
    and counters, even on one side would make them appear thought-about, currently
    they look as if you weren't quite sure what you wanted to do. \r\n\r\nI do like
    the look. It has a calligraphic/nib quality while maintaining the solid ridged
    forms of a sans-serif. \r\n\r\nAre you going to try and expand the weights and
    add an italicized version? What's name do you have in mind for it?"

  body: "The carved or cut-out look is distinctive and has a nice, agreeable feeling
    about it. To me the tail of the g looks drawn backwards.  \r\n\r\nOverall it needs
    more consistency and polish to really work together as an alphabet. \r\n\r\nYou
    need to test it in words extensively to see what works on this. \r\n\r\nOn the
    versions, if you give them different names, 1, 2, 3, or a, b, c, then they should
    install ok and keep the old version. There may be a better way to do this, but
    that works. "

    \ You addressed many of the issues that I was questioning like the square counters.
    \ \r\nAndrew, I have no idea on names yet I'm hoping a name will come to me in
    the process.  I do plan on playing around with some other weights pretty soon
    to see how they work.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time,\r\n\r\nJoshua"

    believe the smoothest way of testing fonts is to generate the fonts in the directory
    of InDesigns own Font folder. When doing this you don\u2019t have to do anything
    special for the fonts to work \u2013 as soon as a new font is in this folder \u2013
    it gets updated directly in InDesign. Without having to restart anything or go
    via some font handling application."
