  body: Interesting stuff. I love Hangul, don't get me wrong, but I am a little disappointed
    that my name can't be expressed with a one-syllable MAEKS and has to be MAEK +
    SEU. Better than Katakana MA + K + KU + SU though.

  body: "Thanks for the report, Michael! I never made it to Paju...\r\n\r\nMax, that's
    a feature of the language and orthography, not of the alphabet itself. Modern
    Korean pronunciation doesn't have the combination 'ks' at the end of a syllable,
    or indeed any 's' at the end. But in spelling there are plenty of words ending
    in 'ks' \u3133 or 's' \u3145, so they must have been pronounced as such at one
    stage (though current orthographic 's' in some cases didn't come from historical
    's').\r\n\r\nIn modern pronunciation though, the 's' in any syllable-final 'ks'
    is silent unless followed by a particle that begins with a vowel. So if we write
    MAEKS \uB9E7, people would just pronounce it as 'Mac'. This is why we add the
    extra vowel at the end to force the 's' to be pronounced in MAEKSEU \uB9E5\uC2A4.
    You can see that this is about pronunciation restrictions of the spoken language
    and spelling conventions. If we didn't have the convention of using 'ks' in spelling
    where the 's' is silent, we could conceivably have decided that Max would be rendered
    as one syllable MAEKS. So this is not an inherent limitation of the alphabet."

  body: That's true and a good point. I suppose it's like blaming Roman letters for
    English's horrible orthography.
