  graphic designer Jocelyn Cottencin made those beautiful typography.\r\nI know that
  for other font he has created he uses a pattern that he transform in scatter brush
  via illustrator.\r\nI guess he uses this technique in an other way that I can't
  figure out.\r\nIf you guys can share your guesses or solutions, It will be incredible!\r\nHope
  you enjoy his work like me...\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nhttp://www.jocelyncottencin.com/index.php\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Some of the examples you posted were simply reversing letters out of a background,
    which is a common technique, but it was done nicely. When done via software (InDesign,
    Photoshop, etc) you create a pattern and then put \u2014 or draw \u2014 white
    letters on top of it. I don't use scatter brushes so I can't comment on that technique."
