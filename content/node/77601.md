body: "We are having a discussion about which OT features are best suited for some
  substitutions for the Unifraktur blackletter fonts. Three of them are contextual:
  longs-replacement, r-rotunda replacement and an etc.-ligature (et represented by
  r-rotunda, as it is common with blackletter fonts). The fourth one shall replace
  \xC4, \xD6, \xDC by Ae, Oe, Ue.\r\n\r\nThe ligature is quite easily done with [clig].\r\nThe
  long-s replacement shall not be on by default (personally, I don\u2019t recommend
  automatic replacement on font level, but it can be useful on the web, where a fallback
  layout shouldn\u2019t look too uncommon to the reader). It\u2019s a quite simple
  replacement of s before lc-letters and ZWJ by \u017F, so the writer has to know
  the orthographic rules, they can inhibit it using ZWNJ. Now I have seen such replacement
  implemented as [hist] or [ssXX], but both are recommended to be used with single
  substitution. I find [hist] is semantically wrong because the long s is not historic
  in blackletter but mandatory. As for [ssXX], there have been various threads where
  the argument goes, that for single character replacement [cvXX] should be used,
  which again is not contextual. Which problems might one face when using a contextual
  substitution with a non-contextual feature?\r\n\r\nThe r-rotunda replacement (after
  letters with a curved stroke on their right) is about the same problem as the long-s
  one. Just this one actually is historic.\r\n\r\nThe Umlaut replacement is a single
  substitution, that would go in [ssXX] or perhaps in [cvXX], probably both adequate?"

  body: You don't have to limit the use of contextual lookups to features that are
    defined as 'contextual'. You can freely use contextual lookups in any feature
    if it makes sense to do so. Some of my Stylistic Set features in the MS Gabriola
    font include both non-contextual and contextual lookups, because there are some
    contextual substitutions that are normative to the particular stylistic variation.

    lookups (\xC4 \u2192 Ae)? If so, what\u2019s the reason for recommending the tags
    to be used with one certain lookup type in the Open Type Layout Tag Registry?"

  body: "> what\u2019s the reason\r\n\r\nHistorical (the early OpenType specs assumed
    that certain lookup types would be tied to certain features). The implementational
    policy of the major text engine vendors proved that this was an unnecessary limitation.
    Currently, the implementational suggestions in the OpenType spec for certain features
    can be treated as \"use this if you don't want to think too much\". "
