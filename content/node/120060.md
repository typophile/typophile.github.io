body: There's this font I've got stuck in my head which I can "almost" see perfectly.  If
  it's not the one that I've posted a sample of here, then it's mighty close.  Maybe
  I saw it as the font in an old TV show?  I seem to remember a slight 3D quality.  If
  anyone can at least get me the name of the one I've posted, it will be helpful as
  I'd be able to see a whole alphabet and not just 6 letters.  Thanks.

    or \"Antique\" [Now called Egyptian]\r\nAs for digital fonts, I can give you several
    with a similar ultra heavy Clarendon leg on the _R_ which would give you an approximation
    0f _MOZART_ and thick slab serifs but other details would need to be edited for
    a closer match: the thin strokes on lhs of _M_ and _A_; the clipped corners to
    make the serifs angular; and the octagonal _O_.\r\nHernandez  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/HernandezAsMOZART_3470.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hwt/hwt-slab/\r\nSpade

  body: "Good observation Nick. It is indeed a cleaned up version of Alphabet Lapidaire
    Monstre which has always been a source of amazement to anyone who has seen it.
    It would be possible to recreate the  Alphabet Lapidaire Monstre, sans schmuck
    version, from one of the fonts I mentioned.\r\nDon\r\n"
