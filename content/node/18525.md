body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm sitting here learning Fontographer and have a few questions.\r\n\r\n1.
  As a font-designer, must I learn the hinting process or could I (as the manual suggests)
  let it be on \"auto\" and just leave it?\r\n\r\n2. When it comes to placing the
  letter between the sidebearings, I have a theory here which I would be very happy
  to get some inputs of. In most of the fonts I have used, the letters are placed
  with equal sidebearings (more or less anyway). But, what really happens when the
  user later on set the text in one  textblock, in InDesign or Quark?\r\n\r\nWhat
  I mean, is:\r\nIf you set a headline and bodycopy with different sizes adjusted
  to the left in the same text-block \u2013 the headline is automatically placed a
  little bit to the right, isnt it? This is due to the left \"space\" of the character.
  The bigger the headline, the bigger the distance becomes. To solve this, the user
  have to make the headline in one separate textblock and move it a little bit to
  the left in order to get a feel that the headling and bodycopy is on the same vertical
  \"guideline\"\r\n\r\nTo my theory:\r\nWouldnt it be a more user-friendly approach
  to place all letters as close to the left sidebearing as possible, and build the
  font according to this approach instead? So that every character starts on \"zero\".
  Then the left margins would be more straight for the user of the font.\r\n\r\nLooking
  forward to hear your thoughts on this matter.\r\n\r\nRegards from Sweden\r\n\r\nG\xF6ran\r\n\r\nwww.neptuna.se"

    their left sides.  The trouble is that you must balance interletterspacing to
    different optical values of space. The left of a V is not optically balanced to
    the left of an H, for example.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I think that I maybe wasnt so clear in my explanation (probably because my
    bad english). I give it another try =)\r\n\r\nThe V and H always has the same
    unoptical balance, no matter where it's placed, isnt it?\r\n\r\nKeep the same
    spacing but move the letters all to the left. Like you take every letter and move
    them to the left. In my opinion, the same optical problems will always occure
    if they are to the left, middle or to the right. \r\n\r\nAs an example: The \"V\"
    would even even break the left sidebearing, then it will look like this in InDesign.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    I'm completely wrong here, but there must have been theories like this before...
    for me it seems like the font would become more user-friendly.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/breakout_V_H.jpg]"

  body: The problem with your idea is that, by making the left sidebearings equal
    (in effect) regardless of size, you will now have twice as much difference on
    the right sidebearing when comparing different sizes. Sure, it will work okay
    for flush left text, but not so good for centered or flush right.

    body: Hi Goran, I've been in typography for thirty years and not been bold or
      imaginative enough to design an original font. I have also been by turns impressed
      and dismayed by new fonts that become available. Good luck to you - but do you
      have something original to offer, or another in an interminable list of tweeks
      and variants. There are not too many typefaces - but there is a lot of shite

  body: "Dear Privateortheris,\r\n\r\nI don't really understand why you are explaining
    about your feelings towards new typefaces. My question was regarding hints and
    a theory about placing the letters.\r\n\r\nBut, as a straight and honest answer
    tou you:\r\n\r\nI've been into type design for about 2-3 years. My first try for
    a new typeface I did at the age of twenty years old. I did the design in Illustrator
    at that time. This font is to be produced & released this year by Type Foundry
    Psy/Ops (www.psyops.com). The name of the font is Neptuna. Maybe you'll get a
    chance to see it if you are interested in new fonts and typography. \r\n\r\nThe
    reason for now learning Fontographer (and asking these questions) is to be able
    to make my design for new typefaces directly in a professional font-editor, instead
    of Illustrator.\r\n\r\nI thought this forum was the right place to ask specific
    questions regarding building typefaces in Fontographer, or Fontlab.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes - I do think I have something original to offer, but of course, I let the
    users be the judge of that.\r\n\r\nNow, do you have so knowledge about the hinting
    process? Please share it, if you have the time.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "When I was working in Fontographer, I mainly used autohinting. Fontographer's
    manual hinting tools are not very good--they give almost no feedback on the effects
    of what you are doing. That said, I got mixed results with it, and it was even
    worse if I tried to do it manually. I don't think it's very good with hinting,
    automatic or manual. \r\n\r\nThe hinting tools in FontLab are much better. Perhaps
    now that FontLab owns Fontographer and is actively developing it, they will improve
    its hinting algorithms and functionality in the new version they are working on
    (the first new version in ten years)."

  body: "Mark, Thanks for your answer.\r\n\r\nI'm curious, what is the worst that
    could happen if the hinting process is not so well done?\r\n\r\nIs it when (if)
    people print with very low resolution that the hinting helps to correct the shapes
    of letters? If not well hinting is done, the letters will form different from
    what the designer may want?\r\n\r\nIs it possible to leave out the hinting process
    completely, that is no hints at all, and how would it effect the font produced?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Hinting is all about compensating for situations where there not enough pixels
    or bits to display the font in a reasonable way. What happens is that stem thickness
    varies, counters fill in, thin features disappear, the characters don't line up
    along the baseline, etc. Without hinting, fonts look like a bad fax.\r\n\r\nHinting
    is a way of telling the font rasterizer which parts of the glyphs are important,
    which parts are stems (and should appear to be the same thickness), and so on.
    When a font is rasterized, the shapes of the glyphs are altered to fit the pixel
    grid better and make the font look better at lower resolutions. \r\n\r\nIn fact,
    the character shapes are being distorted, but it's not possible to display fonts
    accurately at low resolution anyway, so it's a good compromise. When the hinting
    process is not so well done, the hints are inappropriate or incorrect and cause
    the rasterizer to distort the characters in undesirable ways. The most common
    problem I have seen with Fontographer's auto-hinting is characters not always
    aligning correctly along the baseline or x-height.\r\n\r\nHinting nowadays mostly
    comes into play when a font is displayed on a computer screen. When outputting
    to medium- to high-resolution devices like laser printers and film, bad hinting
    or even no hinting is not such a big problem."

  body: "\" for me it seems like the font would become more user-friendly.\"\r\nYou're
    right about that. First, actually, they wanted fonts that were right to the top
    of the Em, so that the vertical cousin of the problem you describe would be solved.
    Many display faces in our library are thus crammed to the top of the Em. The right-left
    problem used to be solved with a 6 pt. space character, and a huge negative kerning
    pair, or another text box, which technically, is tradiational ;) \r\n\r\nIsn't
    there something in OT or ATT for this? Like vertical alignment offset or something?"

  body: "dezcom - so you mean that you are putting a little extra space inside the
    textblock to the left on bodycopy and maybe not on the headings?\r\n\r\nBut what
    if we didnt had to do this \"tricks\". Wouldnt it be really cool if something
    could be done regarding this vertical left side? Type it - and it will fit perfectly.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I think about it again: if a font was build in this way my example shows above,
    the centered would only be moved a little to the left optically. In my opinion,
    most of the texts are however placed to the left, so still i found this theory
    a bit interesting. Or why not make some kind of super-font, that automatically
    adjusts and choose the version depending on if the text is set left, centered,
    or right. That couldnt be so tricky to pull, could it? Some script or something...
    Opentype perhaps, as dberlow speaks about?\r\n\r\ndberlow - interesting that some
    of the display faces are build that way. thanks for sharing the info.\r\n\r\nBTW....I
    wish my english was better... :)"

  body: "Goran,\r\nYour English is fine, don't let it bother you. \r\n\r\nYes, I put
    a bit more space to the left on text when the heads above look out alignment with
    it. It would be nice if we did not have to come up with tricks to make things
    work.  Typographers always have had tricks (using coppers and brass to fix alignment
    in metal type and kerning LT combinations on a band saw).  I think the money in
    development aspect comes in to play.  The profit on type has gotten so small that
    people can't afford to put extra time in to really overcome all the problems.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I very much like your new icon!\r\n\r\nChrisL"
