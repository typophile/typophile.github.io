  I need to redraw this logo and ofcourse all they had was this scan. I've been looking
  for the font of both \"Structura\" and the information below. Have tried Identifont
  and WhatTheFont, but no luck.\r\n\r\nThe font above looks very much like Pritchard
  or URW Oklahoma or Adobe ITC Anna, but differs slightly, especially the \"R\".\r\n\r\nHelp
  would be, ofcourse, greatly appreciated.\r\nKind regards,\r\nTom Swinnen"

  body: That's what I thought at first too, Rainer. I condensed it down, though and
    it doesnt' really work. DecoTech is closer, but still no. Still searching, 'cause
    I'm sure I've seen this ...

    that different R again. \r\n\r\nAnyway, already thanks for helping me look for
    this. I'm close to just drawing the letters.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on the font for
    \"Business and Residential Property\", by the way?"

    gill sans condensed, although the 'R' looks wrong for this\r\n\r\n"
