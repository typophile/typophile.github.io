    Fette Engschrift</a>. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_din_ot_condensed_bold/?&sample_text=UNSTAGED%20PHOTOGRAPHY&sample_size=48&acs_pt=32&update=0">FF
    DIN Condensed Bold</a> is a bit smoother.

  body: "Thanks for your reply\r\nIt's funny... I was looking for DIN too, but at
    My Fonts Parachute version had a non maching \"S\" with diagonal terminals. Also
    Paratype DIN had a different shaped \"G\". FF DIN \"G\" has a subtle vertical
    roundness and looks smoother like you mentioned.\r\nDefinitly Fette Engschrift
    looks the closest.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\nBest"
