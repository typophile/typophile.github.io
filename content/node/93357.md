  a couple minutes getting rid of a shadow that was cluttering things up.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font

  body: "Right you are again fvilanakis.\r\n\r\nThis is actually a version of Baskerville.
    \ I don't know what I would do without this resource here--I have all of the fonts
    that I am looking for, but in total there are probably 40,000-60,000 fonts archived
    on my system and it takes a long time to look through them all.  I've tried using
    the WhatTheFont matching service a couple of times, but it can never come as close
    to identifying fonts as a skilled human eye can.\r\n\r\nThanks again fvilanakis--you
    made my life just a little bit easier.\r\n\r\nMike"
