  box office function, enabling you to buy tickets for your local cinema.\r\n\r\nattached
  is a first idea, white on dark purple for online usage, and positive for letterhead
  etc.\r\ncritique welcome,\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\ncurtze"

  body: "I prefer v1 as well.  The thing that I like the most of it is that your dot
    matrix is pretty unique, that your X center is above the mid-riff, and that C
    has an upward swell.  Almost hinting at the Deco.\r\n\r\nThis is a good thing
    to my eyes, since a lot of my favorite old movie theatres are from the deco era.\r\n\r\nBut
    this also has a nice contemporary feel to it as well.  So I'd recommend adjusting
    the letters, but just don't turn them into your generic dot matrix letters.\r\n\r\nYou
    could also play with putting this in a type of relevant frame (i.e. look at old
    theatre billboards).\r\n\r\nAnd make sure you look at this really big.  I learned
    some lessons doing this on a similar logo approach awhile ago.  Given, it won't
    be that big that often but it may find itself on a billboard or banner someday).

  body: "thanks for your comments.\r\n\r\ni've added some new ideas (versions C1-C3)
    to broaden the spectrum. i wonder whether things are getting any better.\r\n\r\nmy
    favourite is still version 1, with changes to be made as suggested. i also like
    the slight retro-feelgood-cinema touch it has without becoming to old-fashioned.
    i agree there's some potential in a frame, but can't really envision anything
    with it...\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\ncurtze"

      the moment.

  body: "The shadowing in C4 seems odd to me as if it's two shadows from different
    light sources/angles?\r\n\r\nThe thin rules in B3 are nice at larger sizes but
    are obviously lost when reduced...just something to think about.\r\n\r\nI'm with
    the others on your dot-matrix attempt, I like the simplicity/feel of it. It has
    a unique style and grid to it that will make it stand out from other less well
    thought out uses of dots."

  body: "It seems to me that C3 has some mileage in it though the light source is
    a bit theatrical rather than cinematic, perhaps lit from beneath would change
    that. C4 gives me the impression of a roll of film which could work better if
    the 'shadow/film still on the roll' had more of a curve on it. The old ticket
    styles are a bit obvious while not having an outstanding quality to them.\r\nTim"

  body: "I'm still feeling the original dot approach.  As is the case, it's usually
    the first idea that shines the brightest.\r\n\r\nThat said, B3 might be a good
    way to go depending on how they want to position themselves.  That has a very
    fandango big brand look and feel to it.  Whereas A has a more sophisticated unique
    feel to it.  This appeals to me more, but am I your audience group?\r\n\r\nI think
    C1 might have some legs, but I see it working like the Paramount logo or the old
    Le Monde Cafe logo.  Big globe with big ol letters in front of it.  Again a nod
    to the deco.\r\n\r\nI agree on the shadowing on those newer attempts, seems a
    little off to me."

    to the front letters.  That will look more polished.

  body: I agree wholeheartedly that the first logo is by far the best. It's clean,
    simple, elegant and distinctive. As a bonus, it will stand up to being reproduced
    at a significantly smaller size or in black and white.

  body: "I really wish we could get inline images back. It's impossible to keep track
    of progressions when they're all forced into one post.\r\n\r\nI'd go with B3.
    It's cliche, a tad cheesy, but seems absolutely appropriate for the subject matter,
    and perhaps a bit stronger at small sizes at low resolution (ie, on a web site)\r\n\r\nI
    agree with others that #1 is the best logo in terms of overall aesthetics, concept,
    etc, but not sure if it's the most appropriate. If you do use it, I'd restrict
    it's use to the reversed form.\r\n\r\nAlso, on a tangent, does the world need
    yet another online movie ticket site? ;o)"

    so sure... if it says everything in 45 seconds that you would put into a 30 minute

    about iMovie being relatively quick to put a presentation together."

    me.
