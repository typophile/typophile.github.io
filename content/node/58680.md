  then again Ive only shown it to a few people so would appreciate any feedback you
  have.\r\n\r\nIts for a group-travel website/app. \r\nThe \"Stormer\" in the title
  is reffering to \"brainstorming\" however I avoided using imagery that relates to
  brainstorming as its usually pretty cliche.\r\n\r\nSo have gone literal on it and
  used the tornado type of storm which Im pretty happy with.\r\n\r\nThe typeface is
  National.\r\n\r\nthanks for your time and feedback obviously welcome.\r\nGeorge\r\n\r\n"

  body: I like the type of the logotype a lot, but maybe the logo is a bit to pointy
    (caligraphic) for it and a bit to big. But that might be a matter of taste.

  body: "Hey George,\r\n\r\nDon't let it get to ya, your on your way man. Clich\xE9s
    are ok they just need some adjustment to work. Try experimenting with the shape
    you have, take some tranparent paper and lay over your logo and sketch for a while.
    What I noticed in your logo was this interresting countershape. If you don't mind
    I removed the bottom swirl. It now looks a bit like the Ripcurl logo, but what
    I try to show is that you can take your shape somewhere else. It's not where you
    start but where you end up. There are some interviews with Paul Rand on youtube
    [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta4ef1xBeMA]] inspiring designer with simplistic
    logical thinking. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5682_4660.gif]"

    you pointed it out!\r\n\r\nSidney, yes I have been aware of the countershape,
    its kind of a wave isnt it which is also kinda relevant to the \"storm\"\r\n\r\nheres
    how I got to where I am, it would be good to get any more feedback from any of
    you about any of these directions. \r\n\r\nSidney youll notice I had explored
    that style just previously to putting the bottom twirl on... thanks!\r\n\r\nThis

  body: It's a very pleasant shape. Reminds me of the iris of an eye, or shutter of
    a camera, as well as the wave/tornado thing you had before. Is this going to be
    in colour?

  body: i was drawn to the one 2 below that--nice dimensionality. but the last swoosh
    coming out and up to the left seems off to me for some reason. i can't quite place
    my finger on it. maybe the lines need to be tweaked, or it could be that i expect
    the top to be the fattest, not the skinniest. or maybe the negative space comes
    to too abrupt of an end. as i said, not quite sure--but that version had something
    in it for me

    something I like about that one too, but definitely seems off, particularly the

  body: 'I was wondering the exact same thing. It''d be best if the gradient was rotational
    (perpendicular to a radial gradient). Otherwise you could do a simple radial gradient.
    I''d get the gradient on a new layer and clip it to the spiral, then fiddle with
    transparency blend modes until the right effect comes out. '

    to something more playful as this is a leisure brand we want to promote good fun
    times. \r\n\r\nBasically we cant decide out of these two options, the version
    with two extended \"R\"s seems more consistant and unified across the word, but
    seems to be less readable particularly at the smaller size, agree?\r\n\r\nThe
    left version is more readable but does the single raised ligature seem out of
    place without both?\r\n\r\nthese are the two types of feedback we've got from
    almost everyone so Im putting it back to you guys for any thoughts. thanks again.\r\ngeorge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LOGO_FINALS__6737.jpg]"
