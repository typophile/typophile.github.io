  love to hear if you think the Knockout and ITC Slimbach work well together. I chose
  Slimbach because I felt its narrower width worked well with Knockout, and they seemed
  to have similar stroke width proportions. I'd love to hear opinions on other faces
  that could better serve my needs and why.\r\n\r\nI'd also love to hear some of your
  thoughts on the hierarchy, whether there's too much leading and anything else you
  can imagine.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I think you've nailed the fonts. \r\n\r\nI find the hierarchy on page 2 a
    little confusing; your skillset needs to be more subordinate to the rest, by setting
    the column lower on the page or separating it, whether in a coloured block or
    with a line. When i first look at that page, I dont know where to look first.\r\n\r\nI
    like your asterisks but dont think you need brackets as they complicate the communication.\r\n\r\nLeading
    on the italic descriptions could tighten up and the point size could go down.
    I'd also keep all your work samples on the same side of the page, either left
    or right, not staggered, to improve the flow.\r\n\r\nOtherwise good effort and
    good luck"
