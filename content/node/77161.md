  body: "A beautiful and informative chart, which will no doubt prove helpful to many
    people considering the design of a Hebrew typeface.\r\n\r\nHowever, it creates
    the appetite for more.\r\n\r\nUnder \"Characters Used for Hebrew Grammar\", we
    see two forms of the Komatz, one longer than the other. But these distinct characters
    aren't named, nor are Unicode points given for them.\r\n\r\nShvah and Komatz are
    both shown aligned below the characters - and it appears that the same alignment
    applies for both of them, making those two charts redundant (except for differences
    caused by the fact that Shvah is narrower). But the correct alignment of marks
    that appear above the characters isn't shown.\r\n\r\nOh, and the alignment of
    Shvah and final Nun is missing."

  body: "In the entire Tanach (Hebrew Bible), a combination of a final nuhn and shva
    never occurs. A combination of a final nuhn and komatz however does occur. Hence,
    only the latter appears.\r\n\r\nIn the entire Tanach (Hebrew Bible), a combination
    of a final chaf with shvah or komatz occurs many times. Therefore, these combinations
    appear as a standard item in a vocalized (with nikud and dagesh) font.\r\n\r\nIn
    a font, the dagesh version of a final chaf has the shvah or komatz appear either
    above the baseline, to allow the taam to be positioned below the baseline, or
    in order for these nikud vowels to stand out, as a nikud rarely occurs in the
    final form of a Hebrew letter.\r\n\r\nA final mem does have chirik appear under
    it when followed by a non-appearing yud, as in the world, Jerusalem \u05D9\u05E8\u05D5\u05E9\u05DC\u05D9\u05DD.
    Hence, there is a dedicated glyph for this combination.\r\n\r\nIn OpenType, only
    Unicode values appear. The \"advanced\" or \"intelligent\" Hebrew fonts substitute
    and reposition the required combinations (GSUB and GPOS), so additional Unicode
    values are not necessary.\r\n\r\nAbove the alignment rules are visually described,
    as you noted.\r\n\r\nBasically, the nikud vowel is centered under the medium width
    Hebrew letter. In the case of a Daled or Reish, it is right aligned under the
    vertical stem of the letter. In the case of the narrow or wide Hebrew letters,
    the nikud vowels are centered as well, though some modification is done by the
    type designer, based on the particular design of that Hebrew letter.\r\n\r\nThe
    characters for Hebrew grammar are also those for the shvah-na. A Unicode value
    is not given, because the Unicode Consortium has not assigned one as of yet. I
    will post the Unicode value for the komatz katan.\r\n\r\nThe folded lamed (the
    ascender is folded to be parallel to the ascender height (important for narrower
    line spacing, and/or not bump into the nikud vowels in the line above.\r\n\r\n"

    who retired early, to travel across the USA, to heal people. Her formula was simple:
    in part of her prayers, called \"Rafehnu\" in the Amidah, she thought of the person
    who needed healing. As a result, the person was healed.\r\n\r\nRafehnu means \"Heal
    us (O G-d)\".\r\n\r\nI asked my rabbi how this was possible. He explained that
    during her life she must have done something remarkable. And in the merit of that
    good act, G-d granted special powers.\r\n\r\nI return to the woman, and prodded
    for that something special she did. She told me that it must have been when she
    was a small child. Her grandfather lived with her family when he was very old,

    in the mouth. Like the gay rights activists argue about great gay people in the

  body: "A good thing doesn't justify a wrong thing. That certainly is true.\r\n\r\nPeople
    of every faith, though, generally speaking, belong to that faith, and not another
    one because it is the faith they grew up with, the one in which they were instructed
    with in childhood from their parents. Thus, people who belong to a different faith
    from one's own are not there because they have committed, any more than the members
    of one's own faith, the sin of not searching for the true message of G-d to humanity.\r\n\r\nThe
    people of all the faiths may think that their own faith is the One True Faith,
    but the world does not know which is which. The world does, however, know the
    difference between someone who is righteous and kind, and someone who is wicked
    and cruel.\r\n\r\nBut what is that supposed to mean, as a message from Jesus to
    people who are believing Christians? Thanks guys for coming to the right church
    on Sunday, but it doesn't really matter? No, because that's a message that could
    hardly be at the heart of a religious denomination that would continue to exist.\r\n\r\nA
    bit of humility about whether the faith of one's fathers is really the True Faith
    is, however, not inappropriate. But that isn't really the message here.\r\n\r\nInstead,
    it is generally believed - although different denominations handle this one differently,
    and some would not accept this - by Christians to be this:\r\n\r\nDo not count
    yourself as righteous because you are privileged to be in the True Faith and others
    are not.\r\n\r\nThe W-rd is spoken to Man in order that he might be righteous
    and do what is pleasing in G-d's eyes. If those who have not heard the W-rd still
    do what is righteous to their fellow man, is it not even more pleasing?\r\n\r\nThose
    who have heard the W-rd are also called to worship. But the worship, the prayers,
    the sacrifices, and the burnt offerings of those who oppress their neighbor are
    not pleasing unto the L-RD.\r\n\r\nOf course, this seems to be saying that good
    works towards one's fellow man are what Christianity is about, and religious belief
    is secondary - an addition rather than a fundamental obligation. The reality of
    Christianity as a whole is more complicated than that. This is the message of
    one parable, that of the Good Samaritan.\r\n\r\nBut elsewhere, the New Testament
    also points out that \"by grace, not works\" people are saved - the necessary
    thing is to believe in Christ, so that He can forgive your sins. But it also says
    \"faith without works is dead\". Christianity basically reconciles these contradictory
    messages like this:\r\n\r\nChrist died on the Cross in order that it may be possible
    to forgive sin (or, at least, to forgive sin without sacrificing animals at the
    Temple).\r\n\r\nTo have your sins forgiven, it is helpful (but perhaps not strictly
    necessary, as far as what is explicitly stated) to accept Christ as Savior.\r\n\r\nIf
    you really have done this, though, then you will be righteous and you will do
    acts of kindness to your neighbor. (Or, at least you will _want_ to; G-d looks
    upon the heart while the world sees only actions and their results. Doing the
    right thing is important, but what counts is doing or trying to do the right thing
    for the right reasons.)\r\n\r\nAnd those who truly follow Christ are also called
    to the worship of G-d.\r\n\r\nSo in Christianity there is a strict ordering of
    prerequisites:\r\n\r\n- faith in G-d and Christ;\r\n- works of justice, mercy,
    and charity;\r\n- acts of worship.\r\n\r\nThe earlier items are required to give
    the later ones meaning, and the later ones are necessary consequences if the earlier
    ones are really present. So, while there is an ordering, there is also some circularity."
