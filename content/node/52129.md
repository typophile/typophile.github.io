  body: "I started a small book publishing company, publishing modest local-interest
    books that I knew I could sell without much trouble (and wouldn't cost me a lot
    to have printed). I hired myself to do the design and typesetting. As time went
    by, self-publishing authors in my locale who saw my books and liked the way they
    looked, began hiring me to produce their books, and with a track record and portfolio
    now, I began bidding on book production projects for historical societies and
    corporations. Eventually I began landing contracts with book publishing houses,
    though these are a result of connections I've developed over the years with people
    in the industry.\r\n\r\nGary"

  body: "well it's as simple as this: you have to know people (connections, friends...),
    or you have to make yourself known to these people (self-published work, buzz,
    press articles, awards). it's a tough job to get contracts in the much sought-after
    business of book design, for it is (for most of the graphic design gurus wannabes)
    the pinnacle of artistic freedom and \"look what i can do with my indesign and
    my avant-garde / gotham / helvetica\".\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "@ david r - right now i don't really have connections. i've done 4 text-heavy
    books for the salvation army (where i work) which has been great experience, but
    of course of limited interest. \r\n\r\n@alessandro - i collect fonts, tattoos,
    sci-fi books... this is hard as i'm in the middle of down-sizing my life, so i
    don't really 'collect' much stuff... "

  body: "Two years ago, my brother published a poetrybook with a local publishing
    house. He asked me to design and typeset it. The publisher in question liked the
    design, and asked me to design more books for him. \r\nI'm bascially one of his
    permanent designers now. It's a small publisher (a two man business), but they
    put out quite alot of books.\r\nWho knows the work I do for him now, can provide
    me with more book design work for other publishers. I think this is a good way
    to get into it."
