body: "We are postponing our regular Calgary Type Club meeting by one week. Calgary
  is awash in sickness and flu, but we're all taking our vitamins and we'll be much
  better next week. (And hopefully next week's conversation will *not* be mired down
  with graphic discussions of symptoms.)\r\n\r\nThe March 26 meeting will be held
  at Jupiter, 124 - 10th Street N.W. Jupiter is just behind The Source in Kensington:
  access is on the south side of the building, through the door marked with a Z, and
  up the stairs.\r\n\r\nWe have some typefaces to review and we should start discussing
  TypeCon. Who's going and who ain't. Maybe we'll get an update on Lex's movie. Maybe
  we'll see how much Calgary interest there is in this year's Type Camp. Or maybe
  we'll just talk about chocolate.\r\n\r\nSee everybody next Wednesday at 6 o'clock
  p.m."
