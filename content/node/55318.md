body: "Trying to round up options for printing [[http://swapped.cc/stuff/tmp/card.pdf|this
  business card]]. I am quite new to this, so I would appreciate some guidance.\r\n\r\nFirst,
  the paper is [[http://www.fibermark.com/details.php?productID=189|Touche]] from
  Fibermark. Amazing, suede-like texture. Somewhat similar to Plike, but bolder.\r\n\r\nI
  want to preserve the texture of course, so the inverted printing is not an option.
  So white needs to be printed on black. \r\n\r\nThe four options I have arrived at
  are:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> Metallic foil pressing. Non-metallic foil allegedly flakes
  and doesn't look sharp enough when finer details are present. An example is [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/fusedesign/3024737502/|here]].\r\n<li>
  Letterpress in metallic ink. An example is [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/themandatepress/3021655187/in/pool-artofthebusinesscard/|here]].\r\n<li>
  Engraving. An example is [[http://www.beastpieces.com/2009/02/art-of-the-business-card-black-paper/|here]].\r\n<li>
  Silkscreening. An absolutely amazing example is [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/zwoelf/2900054462/sizes/l/|here]].\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI
  would rather not do the metallic ink if possible as I need to get flat white for
  the type. No shimmer and such.\r\n\r\nI would rather not do pressing or engraving
  as these leave the imprint on the back. Though I guess this can be remedied by duplexing
  or using thicker stock.\r\n\r\nEngraving guys said the white is not a problem, but
  opaque yellow ink is a special order, which takes a while and costs a lot (yellow
  is used for the middle stroke between two E's).\r\n\r\nI am inclining towards the
  silk-screened version, but I absolutely cannot find anyone who can do it. Leave
  alone with very tight registration in two colors. Tried emailing the owner of Flickr
  photo, got no response. Does anyone know if there are any printers that could do
  this ? \r\n\r\nAlso the sharpness of small type on that Flickr photo looks very
  impressive, but I suspect it is very hard to achieve. Am I right ?\r\n\r\nThermography
  is another option, but local guys are saying that their white inks are not opaque
  enough to work on black. So I was wondering if doing termography <em>over a foil</em>
  would work - any thoughts on this ?\r\n\r\nThanks for any pointers and/or comments.
  I could really use some :-)"

    opaque white on anything (I think). It's been a while.

    someone who can do it.

  body: You could choose any of the options you have. I think that in offset this
    will come out great and clean & affordable. If not, print it in letterpress over
    black paper - white and yellow.

  body: "It is unlikely that your <em>thermography over foil</em> idea could be done.
    Thermography works by dusting a powder over wet ink, and then heating the paper
    so that the power fuses to the ink and swells. It would be difficult, if not impossible,
    to print an ink onto foil, not to mention that the heat from the process would
    probably damage the foil. \r\n\r\nAlso, thermography is generally looked down
    on as a poor imitation of engraving.\r\n\r\nUnless you can find a silk screener
    who can do the fine detail and the close registration your yellow ink requires,
    your best, and most expensive, option is with engraving.\r\n\r\nP.S. Thanks for
    taking the time to provide all the links in your original posting. It really saves
    time for the rest of us, and allows for better, more informed opinions.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When

  body: "James, thanks for the Mosaic link. Saved.\r\n\r\nAtoZ, good point re: foil
    idea. I should've thought it through a bit better before posting.\r\n\r\nparagraph,
    AGL - thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nTalked to the engraving guys today, looked
    at some of their work and it is <em>really</em> impressive. So I will go with
    the engraving (which actually works out to be cheaper than foil stamping, go figure)
    on a thinner stock and then will have it duplexed to conceal the engraving imprint
    on the back. Then a bit of custom die cutting and it'll be a beauty :-)\r\n"

  body: 'There''s an aqueous coat that creates the same suede-like finish as Fibermark
    Touche, but it can be printed on any coated stock. You can use conventional offset
    to print black (and the yellow rule) on white stock, with the type reversed out,
    and the suede-finish aqueous on top. We use this process at [[http://www.weandrews.com/wwwWEAndrews/home.asp|W.E.
    Andrews]], where I work. '

    That's certainly not something that any of the local guys can do.

    but they say it softens colors a bit, so that might be an issue.  \r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    can offer you the best solution. It doesn't hurt to ask seeing that they're the

  body: "Thanks. I just sent them a request. \r\n\r\nMy local engraver ran a proof
    of white Plastitone ink on black Touche and it didn't work ! The first sheet was
    fine, but then the ink started to adhere poorly to the paper on finer details.
    Which is quite weird, because Fibermark explicitly states that Touche is THE best
    choice for engraving. Perhaps the problem lies with the ink (not tacky enough
    ?). \r\n\r\nIn any case let's see what Mosaic has to say on the subject."

  body: Just talked to a tech at Fibermark and she said she had no idea who put the
    "excellent choice for engraving" on Touche's spec page. In fact she said that
    they got a number of similar complaints, so they are in process of investigating
    which inks work and which don't.

  body: Note to self - don't laminate Touche to Plike, these stocks are too different
    and it causes the card to curl. The curl can be straightened out by hand, but
    still it's an annoyance that can be avoided. Plike to Plike should've been just
    fine.

  body: "If you do decide to go with screen printing you would need 2 hits of the
    white to make it opaque... that works great on bold graphics, but tends to close
    up on small type. However that is probably the crispest white you can get. Please
    post the final would love to see how it turned out.\r\n\r\nNice concept by the
    way."

    in white ink on black Plike ([[http://www.westernengraving.ca|these guys]]), laminated
    to Touche, and then die cut with 1mm round corners. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately die
    cutters did a sub par job. The corners are not as sharp and defined as I wanted
    them to be, there's lots of glue smudges and jagged edges. Some registration problems
    too.\r\n\r\nBut even these things considered cards came out pretty awesome. Having
    two textures and the engraving really adds a tactile wow factor."

    If you know the place, I'd love to hear about it.
