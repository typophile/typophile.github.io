		<div class="commentbody">I don't look at many résumés, but I'll give an opinion anyway.

The top of the résumé has left aligned, right aligned and centered copy. For me, this is too much. I would prefer the top to be left aligned, just like the body.

Too much font variation: The worst case is on the job title line, for instance, the one that begins "IT Project Manager". This line is half empty but there are four different font variations! First it's very bold, then its a less bold italic, then its a smaller italic with small numbers, then a slightly bolder roman with large numbers. On one line! This is two or three variations too much. The Adelle font looks nice in the body, though. 

Re: the "Almost PMP certified..." part at the type. To my eye this font doesn't go with any thing else. It's un-needed variation. What is the significance of the gray type throughout? Is this the more important stuff, or less important? It seems a little arbitrary.

It's all just my opinion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Besides what J said, the side margins are too small, and the line length is so long it's painful to read (around 100 characters--75 would be more comfortable). The type can be smaller, and the main headings can hang out into the left margin. But I'd avoid going onto a second page; nobody reads the second page of a resume, unless you're applying to be the chief brain surgeon at a big university hospital.

This has nothing to do with typography, but if you have a college degree, you would be wise to include it (unless it's in something completely unrelated, like flower arranging). 

To me the word "exposure" sounds like "this is stuff that happened to me," when what you want to say is "this is stuff I accomplished." Could you replace it with something like "software skills"?

In the same vein, it doesn't make a good first impression to have the very first word of your resume be "almost." I'd say something like "Project manager and entrepreneur known for successfully leading high-profile development projects through focused user-centered design. Currently enrolled in course for PMP certification." Also, you need a hyphen in "high-profile" for the same reason you need one in "user-centered." And avoid breaking a hyphenated phrase at the end of a line. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Layout:

A bit too much going on here, try to have a minimum of 25% white space.  The paragraphs looks may be a bit too wide I think, try reducing the width (45-65 characters is often though of as the optimal). I can't say I'm an expert on résumés, but how about making it 2 pages to get the whitespace I suggested.

How would the email-, twitter- and linkedin-links look as a single line on the bottom? 


And as J.Tillman said, too much font variation. 


Just some suggestions here :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rules of typography to consider: 

1. Lines should be 60-90 characters wide. 
2. If your font size is 10, leading should be at least 4, more if your font is condensed. 
3. On top, it seems you are trying to use a "newspaper" layout, and you can make it work if you use proper fonts. Right now your mix of fonts don't really work. They are almost similar. You want to choose fonts that compliment each other yet have contrast. Like an Jenson pro and a medium weight condensed avant garde. If you don't have experience mixing fonts, use typefaces from a similar family. 

Look at templates and research good typography, then apply it to your layout. 

Good luck.
