  body: "You can do pretty useful things with re-ordering glyphs. One might think
    the Unicode order would be most useful, but since InDesign (for example) can order
    glyphs by Unicode order <em>or</em> by Glyph ID (which would be your custom order),
    you can group \"similar\" glpyhs together. Minion Pro uses that; in Unicode order,
    Greek and Latin Extended characters are scattered all along the glyphs window,
    whereas in GID/CID order they are nicely grouped together.\r\n\r\nI used this
    trick in my own phonetic font to group all variants of a's, all b's, etc. together.
    I'm not ashamed to confess I put the open o '\u0254' next to the c, the sybilant
    l '\u028E' next to 'y', and the short a '\u028C' next to 'v' -- that's where <em>I</em>
    would look for these! (As I am not a trained linguist; I see rotated characters
    instead.)"
