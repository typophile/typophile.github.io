body: "Hi everybody --\r\n\r\nLong time lurker here. During the recent McSweeney's
  column contest for their website, I pitched them on the idea for a column about
  typography, and how type design and designers have influenced writing and culture
  during the times they were working. To my delight, I was an official runner up,
  which means they're running the column. \r\n\r\nAlthough the target audience is
  people who have very little knowledge about type, I definitely wanted the type community
  to be aware of it, and hope that people will enjoy it.  \r\n\r\nThe column is titled
  \"Letters from the Hellbox,\" and the first installment \"Gutenberg and How Typography
  Is Like Music\" went live today. <a href=\"http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/hellbox/hellbox1.html\">You
  can read it here</a>.\r\n\r\nEvery month I'll look at a different period with a
  focus on historical context, education and designer. I hope you'll take a look!\r\n\r\nBest
  regards, \r\n\r\nMartin McClellan\r\n\r\n"

    failed contributor), I had one of those moments where two spheres of personal
    interest overlapped considerably. \r\n\r\nGreat read, and congratulations!"
