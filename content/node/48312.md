body: I've noticed a trend in the last few years of sans faces that have a very clean
  contemporary look with flattened curves. Prime exampels are <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=stainless&x=0&y=0">Stainless</a>
  and <a href="http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html>Klavika</a>.
  What was the originating face, and does anyone have other notable examples?

  body: "The earliest example I can think of in this category is Microgramma/Eurostile,
    though Bank Gothic and possibly condensed versions of other sans faces might have
    preceded it. In fact, I'm fairly certain there are other squarish sans faces from
    further back. I just don't know them well enough.\r\n\r\nOne of my own early efforts,
    [[http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2206|Bernur,]] probably fits
    in this category too. "
