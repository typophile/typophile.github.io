body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI've been working very hard on a new typeface called NOVA.
  This is a geometric stylistic font with a twist. I call it a twist, because I want
  it to be possible to kinda 'plug and play', or 'stack and play' if you will, with
  the OT features. This should change the character of the font in a major way, giving
  the designer the feeling he's got 4 fonts under his control. I want it to be intuitive
  and robust.\r\n\r\nLet me give you a quick sample of what I've got set up:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/Nova_OT_plug_and_play_sets.jpg\r\n\r\nWhat
  you see here is a sample of Nova with the additional OT features I've got installed.
  The trick is that you can type your text in Nova, than activate the DLIG feature
  \xE1nd the SWSH feature \xE1nd the INIT feature \xE1nd to top it off the SS01 (or
  any other) feature. \r\nI've got the basic OT features set up in Fontlab and this
  works nicely in InDesign. I've done it in a quite simple but effective way and I'm
  well aware that this might not be compatible with other software. It also (kinda)
  works if you use any random combination of OT features. Say if you leave out the
  SWSH and SS01 features, it changes the result in a really nice way giving the designer
  all the chances to play and have fun.\r\n\r\nIt gets now really complicated because
  glyph replacements should not colide and the glyph Classes with accents etc should
  be arranged effectively. This is where I'd like your help with, because this is
  way out of my league.\r\n\r\nHere's the features file:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/Nova_features.txt\r\n\r\nHere's
  the Classes file:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/Nova_classes.txt\r\n\r\n<strong>Question
  for you OT cracks</strong>\r\nHow can I set this up in a solid way that:\r\n- I've
  got my Classes set up correctly\r\n- it works in most software applications\r\n-
  it works with any combination of OT features\r\n- it can be expanded with upcoming
  OT features or glyphs\r\n- standard ligatures (ff) don't clash with dicretionary
  ligatures (ffb)\r\n- and any other issue you can come up with  ;-)\r\n\r\nI'd love
  to hear from you.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\xAE"

  body: "<cite>- it works in most software applications\r\n- it works with any combination
    of OT features</cite>\r\n\r\nThere isn't that much software that use the full
    range of OTF features -- even InDesign does not! (Petite Caps, for example, are
    missing...) On top of that, even Adobe made some \"curious\" choices in the various
    parts of their so-called \"Suite\" -- from memory, Stylistic Alternates (salt)
    is available in Illustrator, but not in InDesign.\r\n\r\nFurther complicating
    the issue is that there are no strict guidelines <em>in what order</em> Opentype
    features are applied. Does it matter for your font if first Swash is processed
    and then Initials? Or the other way around?\r\n\r\nAs to how to prevent clashes,
    I think there is no other option than preventing clashing glyphs to be generated.
    If you have a list of clashing glyphs, you could add a substitution table after
    all \"obvious\" replacements to correct this. It has to be a separate table at
    the end, because every table is only looked at once, and only the first match
    is used.\r\n\r\n(Ligatures are a well-known example of this; if you have\r\n\r\n<pre>replace
    f f with f_f;\r\nreplace f f i with f_f_i;</pre>\r\n\r\nyou will never get to
    see the \"ffi\" in your output.)\r\n\r\nI agree with Hrant: sweet job so far!"

    that where we need to educate the user about what's possible and what not.\r\n<blockquote>Further

    think it's no problem to change the order of the features, that's the charm until
    now. I've got it now setup in such a way that some glyphs become richer wh\xE9n
    you have a certain feature activated. But also without that, it works perfect.
    I'd say, just play around with the features and see what works best for you.\r\n\r\nI've
    read this article, but can't wrap my mind around it:\r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/OpenType/opentype-features.html\r\nIt's
    just a bit over my head to do it this way, but I think it's more sustainable.
    \ ;-)\r\n\r\nWhat do you say to the OT codes? Do they look good enough to work?
    Do you know of a good way to test this? I don't want to publish a font with silly
    glyph issues in it. \r\n\r\n@Hrant: thx  ;-)\r\n\r\nPS: If someone can move this
    to the Build section, I'm fine with that."

  body: The dlig feature seems like a good choice. I wish Adobe would get the features
    updated and at least more consistent between Illustrator and InDesign. I've stopped
    using the salt feature for now in fonts because of its behavior in Illustrator.
    When I make a choice from the glyph palette in Illustrator that just happens to
    be in the salt feature as well, Illustrator decides I've made an overall preference
    choice and keeps the salt feature active throughout any subsequent new text. That
    I find annoying and a waste of time to correct. If Illustrator had stylistic sets
    and didn't proactively change glyph selections into feature activation you could
    easily make changes to a style variation as seen in Nova with either Illustrator
    or InDesign.

  body: "I've read somewhere that it makes sence to put both the dlig \xE1nd the salt
    features in the font, so that it works in different software applications. I think
    this was on a Typophile post and it was a tip from Adam Twardoch, but I'm not
    totally sure.\r\n\r\nDoes this strategy work? Is it possible to put as much features
    in to increase the chance that it works in most software apps."

  body: But all software limitations aside, do you think the OT features are good
    enough to hold ground? If I proceed in this way, would that work? I'm fine with
    catching every little possible glyph conflict, I just wanna know if there are
    better, more solid ways to build my features.

  body: The salt feature is in Illustrator as well as the dlig. Since Illustrator
    is about the only one using the salt feature there wouldn't be much sense in doubling
    it up for that. If I recall I think there was mention before of using salt and
    stylistic sets together. InDesign has the stylistic sets feature, but Illustrator
    does not. In a sense stylistic sets is like an expanded version of the salt feature.
    I wish Adobe would add stylistic sets to Illustrator.
