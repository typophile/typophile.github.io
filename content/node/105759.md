  file which I got from Shutterstock. Sadly the font is in outlines so I cannot determine
  the font used. WhatTheFont gave no results, and I tried other font recognition tools
  to identify it, with no result.\r\n So you are my last hope :)\r\nImages attached
  below are a screenshot of the Shutterstock file and the relevant font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    it is a font rather than logo design.\r\nHere is a font with some similarity <a

    is a font named Pirata One that appears to match the Oktoberfest logo you submitted.   '
