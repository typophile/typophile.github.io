body: "Can anyone help me out with the font used by Bruichladdich across all their
  branding and POS? I'm pretty sure most of the text on here is DIN, but the word
  Bruichladdich seems a little more extended, and also the uppercase C is incorrect.
  Is this just a customisation of DIN or is it a different font? Any ideas greatly
  appreciated. \r\n\r\nMore here... http://www.bruichladdich.com\r\n\r\nBy the way,
  the whisky is jolly good, too."
