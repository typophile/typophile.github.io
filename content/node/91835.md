  copy, thinking about AW Conqueror Didot for my display. The only piece I can't figure
  out is a good sans serif. I have attached a sample page PDF so you can see what
  I'm working with.\r\n\r\nOriginally I was going to use AW Sans, but it only has
  the one weight. I'm finding I need more flexibility, being able to use bolds and
  italics. Does anyone have any suggestions for a sans serif that might fit my needs?\r\n\r\nI
  may just go the obvious route and buy Calluna Sans, but I thought I'd ask for advice
  before I spent the money. "

    I am looking for a sans serif for smaller copy, for stuff like the masthead and
    contents page. I have a typeface for the display copy.
