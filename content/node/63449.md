  logos. They are photos of the typography of the actual model (Astro, Blazer, Camaro,
  Dart, Electra..etc). Besides being a very nice typographic reference, they are pretty
  decent photos.\r\n\r\nhttp://jessechehak.com/portfolios/151-autos\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks. When I look at a collection of these together, I'm struck by the
    similarity to letterpress type: The designers had to create something that could
    be fabricated out of metal. \r\nI'm partial to the logos from the 60s (Swinger,
    Electra 225, Impala), partly because they are more obviously drawn by hand--and
    a very talented hand, too. But I also like the exuberance of US automotive design
    before the oil embargo of the 1970s. Everything that came out of Detroit in the
    60s shouted <em>big, fast,</em> and <em>sexy</em>."
