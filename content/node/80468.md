  identifiers to no avail.\r\n\r\nThe font is in this image:\r\n\r\n[[http://images.uulyrics.com/cover/h/herb-alpert-the-tijuana-brass/album-whipped-cream-other-delights-rewhipped.jpg]]\r\n\r\nAnd
  is the font for \"Whipped Cream & Other Delights\"\r\n\r\nThe first thing that I
  thought of was some kind of \"Soda Shop\" font."

    it a bit. The original would have been custom lettering but based on some model
