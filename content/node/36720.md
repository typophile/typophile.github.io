  quite lengthy documents, regarding brand licensing and the company profile etc.
  I am very new to this and don't know the 'rules' regarding layout of these kinds
  of documents. The original is absolutely hideous an terribly difficult to read.
  There are a lot of very small (1\u20132 sentences) clauses, each with its own subheading
  and I'm just having a bit of trouble with it all. Does anyone have any advice, or
  can link somewhere with standard legal document layouts etc?\r\nThanks"

    leaded/lines too long/bad choice of typeface/page layout too broken up?. If the
    subheading are on their own lines, one way of making the document less choppy
    would be to have the subheads run in on the first line of each clause itself---set
    them in semi-bold or bold (depending on the typeface).\r\n\r\nI don't know that
    there are specific \"rules\" for this kind of document. Regular graphic design
    principles should apply to make the page inviting, easy to read, and easy to comprehend
    the hierarchy of topics."

    okay to make it pretty.  :-)\r\n\r\nHumor aside, I think Gary's got the right
    idea."

  body: "Unless you're reproducing actual legal papers\u2014i.e., motions, writs,
    court orders, etc.\u2014in their actual format, I would lay them out as separate
    docs within your manual, organized in a logical way, maybe an outline format.
    The idea would be to simply make the material readable by your audience. So, again,
    if you're not reproducing actual papers, I'd bump up the typeface size if it's
    too small, make sure the leading helps readability, and otherwise make it something
    that will be easy on your audience's eyes. The idea is to encourage them to read
    from beginning to end, as well as promote decent comprehension.\r\n\r\nIf you
    think the project can benefit from a professional's touch, contact me.\r\n\r\nStephen
