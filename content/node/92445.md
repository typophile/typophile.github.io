  embedding and in drawing some glyphs myself (i.e., torturing letterforms in Photoshop
  and Illustrator) have put me in mind of this question:\r\n\r\nHave you ever started
  designing a typeface based on how it will render on-screen at particular sizes?\r\n\r\nFor
  example, imaging the following spec: \"At 16px, the x-height shall be 8px, the cap
  height shall be 11px, the ascender height shall be 12px (from the baseline), and
  the descenders shall descend 4 px. At 14px, those same numbers shall be 7px, 10px,
  11px, and 3px respectively. At display sizes, it shall look like an English Old
  Style or a Trump Mediaeval, with the following mildly quirky details...\"\r\n\r\nDoes
  such a workflow make sense? Is it bass-ackwards? If you've done something like this,
  has it led to fruitful results?"

  body: "Grant that my example spec is just that: an example. That said, in what way
    is it (\"merely,\" as I infer from your response) average? Seems to me that if
    I were to learn that, I would learn something useful.\r\n\r\nI've seen the comment
    in these forums that true design is a process of reconciling conflicting needs,
    or words to that effect. I'm groping toward on-screen body-text readability and
    transparency that looks \"the same\" as printed display-size beauty and personality.
    On-screen is obviously a reduction in detail.\r\n\r\nIf that's a merely average
    goal, teach me how."

    \r\n\r\nUnless you are the only user (meaning both designer and reader) there\u2019s
    no way to be sure of the exact output size nor the system. What I am doing is
    optimizing my fonts for a small range of sizes on systems that do not use hinting.
    Whoever told us OSX can do all the heavy lifting on its own was a fool. Even the
    Quartz rendering engine involves some degree of math \u201Cmagic\u201D, causing
    diacritica and base glyph crashes, alignment errors, filling in of tight contours,
    heavier diagonals &c. I spend a lot of time getting all that right, simplify A
    LOT of details, and then -- then I hint.\r\n\r\nAnd I optimize so that I need
    as few hints as possible."

  body: "I'd like to see the Franky stuff.\r\n\r\nSo, this workflow <em>has</em> been
    used: [A] make bitmap/greyscale glyphs at target sizes; [B] draw TrueType outlines
    that you think should result in those bitmaps at those sizes; [C] hint them so
    that the output is reasonably faithful to the outlines at all/most sizes; [D]
    compare the rendering at the target sizes to the original bitmaps and iteratively
    adjust, tweak, adjust, tweak, adjust.\r\n\r\nTa daa, Verdana and Georgia.\r\n\r\nIf
    fussy details are part of what gives display-size faces their beauty, and and
    absence of distracting details is part of what gives body-text faces their readability,
    then one task would be to put details into the outlines that are designed to be
    lost as the face is scaled down. \r\n\r\nAnd of course, one would want to use
    proportions that are appropriate/beautiful for print work and successful/readable
    at small sizes on-screen. Compromise? Perhaps. Fatal? I suspect that depends on
    the designer. Not a task for the likes of me, certainly.\r\n\r\nThe only other
    thing I'd like to know is, what other typefaces have been designed with a workflow
    like this (especially any commercially-successful typefaces)? Or perhaps: have
    any of your type designs started with an idea of the outlines you'd like, then
    considered the bitmap rendering on-screen at one or more target sizes, and then
    proceeded [A] thru [D] from there? (Or, do you know of any?)"

    intended <em>1-bit</em> (b&w) rendering, and they required a lot of small size-specific
    glyph-wise tweaks (delta hints). When your intent is grayscale, and to avoid those
    tweaks, you end up with having to make size-specific outlines...\r\n\r\nBTW, also
