  typophiles! I'm proud to share a project that I've been working on for over a year,
  with the assistance of Hermann Zapf and Philip A. Metzger. I've digitized a somewhat
  obscure work of Zapf's, a collection of elaborate letterpress broadsides that serve
  as type specimens, and made them available for online viewing and as high-res, press-quality
  images for download. Please check out the website and let me know what you think.
  The press release is below.\r\n\r\n\u2014 Josh\r\n\r\n<strong>ORBIS TYPOGRAPHICUS:
  A Complete Digital Facsimile</strong>\r\nA project by Joshua Langman\r\nwww.orbistypographicus.com\r\n\r\nA
  rare Zapf masterpiece can now be seen online, just in time for his 95th birthday.\r\n\r\nOrbis
  Typographicus is a rare set of letterpress broadsides created by world-renowned
  type designer Hermann Zapf, in collaboration with Philip L. Metzger of Crabgrass
  Press, between 1970 and 1980. The entire set has now been published digitally by
  Joshua Langman, representing the first time the collection has been reproduced \u2014
  in any medium \u2014 since the original edition of nintey-nine copies.\r\n\r\nWith
  Professor Zapf's encouragement, Langman has scanned the entire set of twenty-nine
  broadsides and made the images available for free on a dedicated website, where
  the pages may be viewed and downloaded as press-quality 1200 dpi images. This rare
  work from a widely acclaimed master in the field can now be seen for the first time
  by those who may not be lucky enough to have access to a hard copy.\r\n\r\nwww.orbistypographicus.com\r\n\r\n<strong>About
  the Broadsides</strong>\r\nOrbis Typographicus\_(\u201CThe Typographic World\u201D)
  is a set of twenty-nine 9 \xD7 12 letterpress broadsides, designed by Hermann Zapf
  and printed by Philip Metzger of Crabgrass Press between 1970 and 1980. The broadsides
  feature quotations on art, science, nature, faith, and the human condition, from
  authors ancient and contemporary. The text includes poetry, prose, anagrams, and
  palindromes, in English, German, Spanish, French and Japanese. Hand set by Philip
  Metzger, the set pays tribute to worthy \u201CThoughts, words and phrases on the
  Arts and Sciences\u201D through Zapf\u2019s unconventional and ingenious use of
  typography. Orbis Typographicus\_functions both as a work of literary wall art and
  as an elaborate type specimen, showcasing many of Zapf\u2019s own faces, as well
  as those of his wife, Gudrun Zapf von Hesse.\r\n\r\n<strong>About the Website</strong>\r\nLangman's
  new digital home for Orbis Typographicus features high-resolution scans, available
  for download, and a complete computer-searchable transcript. The website also features
  a specially written essay by Philip A. Metzger, the son of the printer, in which
  he shares his recollections of his father working on the project. The site will
  officially launch on 6 November 2013, the week of Zapf's 95th birthday.\r\n\r\n<strong>About
  Joshua Langman</strong>\r\nJoshua Langman is a freelance graphic designer and typographer
  based in New York. He discovered Orbis Typographicus by accident four years ago,
  fell in love with the collection of typographic broadsides, and wanted to share
  them with others. He built www.orbistypographicus.com, with Hermann Zapf's encouragement,
  to make his work more accessible to typophiles, calligraphers, letterpress enthusiasts,
  and anyone with a passion for the printed word."

  body: Well, the quote <em>was</em> from Benjamin Franklin, and so we don't have
    to conclude that Hermann Zapf was going to rate typefaces as sanguine, choleric,
    phlegmatic, and melancholic.

  body: Just resurrecting this thread to note that the Orbis Typographicus site ([[http://www.orbistypographicus.com|orbistypographicus.com]])
    now supports Retina displays and other similar high-resolution (> 72 ppi) monitors.
    Each of the images on the site has been exported anew from the original scans,
    and the extra pixels (c. 220 ppi) make a big difference in capturing the sharpness
    of the printing on screen. And of course the press-quality 1200 dpi files are
    still available for download in case even Retina resolution doesn't cut it.

  body: I downloaded the PDF but it takes 2 minutes each time I want to go to the
    next page because the PDF is simply too big. I would've preferred individual pictures.
    Still, this is fantastic to see. Thanks for sharing.

  body: Yes, I know the PDF is huge. You can grab web-quality (retina) images straight
    off the site individually; the PDF is for resolution junkies who want to be able
    to zoom way in. But you're not the first to suggest individually downloadable
    press-quality images; it's on the list. Thanks for checking it out.

    do that with ease. I have to say I'm currently on a technically kind of outdated
    computer though."
