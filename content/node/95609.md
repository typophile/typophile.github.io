body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nSince I've been dealing with fonts with lots of ligatures
  and swashy versions of these ligatures I need a Python script that automatically
  select glyphs names  with the \"X_X\" syntax and create left and right classes placing
  each glyph in the right ones. Of course, each ligature glyph should be in two classes
  (one left the other one right). Generating a text file would be also useful if generating
  the classes is more complicated... \r\n\r\nI think it shouldn't be difficult. Can
  somebody help me with that? My Python knowledge has sort of vanish due to lack of
  practice :/\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
