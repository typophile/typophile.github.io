  body: "The original (magazine) logo would only have worked in this context as an
    outline/cloisonn\xE9 treatment\u2014but that would have been quite interesting."

  body: I'm actually not a fan of the actual Avant Garde logo.  But I think the font
    Avant Garde, especially bold, is one of the best fonts ever made.  Also, it's
    EVERYWHERE right now.

  body: "Lubalin was a Futura man. (He used it in the AG magazine after the logo had
    been made, before he extended it into a typeface.)\r\nHere\u2019s how I \uFB01gure
    he \uFB01rst conceptualized the magazine logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AGfut_4089.png]\r\nFinally:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AgBig_3813.png]\r\nIt
    was the density of adjacent stems in AVA that prompted him to duplicate the effect
    elsewhere, hence the lop-sided A, V &c., and the scrunched up digraphs NT &c."

  body: Yeah those lopsided letters and the overlapping G and A totally ruin it for
    me.  I'm glad they don't appear in the font. (though maybe they are there as alternates,
    not sure)
