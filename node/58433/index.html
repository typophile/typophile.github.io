  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm doing my Bachelor Thesis in English Language and Culture on the perception of typefaces. I intend to establish the existence and extent of the phenomenon that authority is transferred upon the reader through reading the font. So, by having the participants rate texts on authority, I intend to establish that serifs are more authoritative than sans serifs.

So, my question is, have you perhaps come across past research dealing with the subject of fonts and perception? Currently, I'm looking for any info I can get. Any websites, papers, journals... I'd love to hear from you.

Thanks,

		<div class="commentbody">There have been some similar studies in the Psych journals. Sorry, but I can't remember the references. None get too deeply into type design (of the ones I have seen, they are often very basic character recognition studies.)

There is a good article on Bouma on the Microsoft site at http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx

You might also want to look at the writings of Aries Arditi, many of which are available at http://www.lighthouse.org/research/current-research-studies/

Maybe I’m just unfamiliar with the grammar of psych academia, but shouldn’t you intend to determine whether or not a typeface with serifs can enhance the authoritative tone of text? And isn’t authoritativeness a product of the nature of the text? Serifs may be able to enhance the credibility of an authoritative piece of writing in the context of a society where figures perceived as authorities tend to use serifs, but serifs are not able to, for example, impart authority to a comedy that is intended to have none.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@ Thomas: Sounds like an interesting study. This could make a great thread. Can you tell us a little more about yourself and your experimental design?

1. How are you operationalizing the term "authority"
2. How are you asking participants (Ss) to rate authority?
3. Your independent variables (IV's) are typeface (serif and sans). Have you selected any? If so, which ones and why?
4. What text are you having Ss read?
5. What school do you go to?
6. Who is supervising your study?
7. Do you have any background in cognitive/experimental psychology?

As far as research goes, you need to get access to science journals and databases. PsychINFO and Web of Science are probably going to be of most use. If your school does not have access to them, I would strongly ask your supervisor/department head to find someone who does and put you in touch with them. Conducting a lit search without access to such databases &c is asking you to operate with a significant disadvantage. It is a <em>very</em> important skill to develop in the field of experimental psychology.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My main approach will be to present the participants with four names (in different fonts) of lawyer firms, museums, or dictionaries, and have them rate them on authority. Of course, I will rotate the fonts used, in order to eliminate the possibility that one firm/museum/dictionary will have a better-sounding name.

@Don McCahill: Thanks for the links!

@James Puckett: You are correct. My phrasing of the problem is problematic, and because I am very much in the early stages, I will refine it later on.

@Christopher Dean: (1) I haven't found any literature on that, so anything would be more than welcome.
(2) I'll have the participants 'assign' authority through rating the four firms/museums/dictionaries one to four, with one being most authoritative.
(3) The typefaces will have to be representative of a real-world situation, so I will probably make a selection between Adobe Jensen Pro, a Libertine, Adobe Caslon, Georgia, Times New Roman, a Garamond, etc. Any suggestions, maybe?
(4) As said, business logos. I will probably add a question asking the participants to rate a small paragraph of text, as well.
(5) I go to St. Radboud's University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands (www.ru.nl).
(6) M.J. van der Haagen.
(7) No background. This is my first venture into the field of cognitive studies, which is why I'm looking to gather any information I possibly can. I have done a similar study on the effectiveness of adjectives in film descriptions.

@Nick Shinn: Well, that's what I'm trying to find out, really; whether your statement is correct, or whether there's more to it than meets the eye.

@CameronWilliams: The scope of the survey will not allow me to get to much into different categories, although I surely intend to highlight some fonts. Of course, the study will be double-blind.

Having only the name means I'm conducting the survey in an unrealistic environment (i.e. without the complete logo and the rest of the design choices), but my focus is on providing graphic designers with info on typographic decisions only. A survey always has a margin of error, because it simply cannot encompass the entirety of reality. Maybe I could replicate a logo or somehow attain a more realistic representation of a lawyer's office logo. Any help would be more than welcome.

Readers can't tell you that.
As Dave notes, the "authority" of a typeface will change with the way it's set.
Depending on what a company symbol and page layout looks like, the same typeface may look dignified or silly, progressive or conservative.

Symbolic forms such as letters and type have no absolute meaning, but only have meaning in relation to other symbols.
For the reader, these other symbols are the rest of the document at hand.
However, for the designer, the realm of typographic significance is more abstract, and encompasses our knowledge of type culture: it is this meta-language we work with to create meaning for readers.

		<div class="commentbody">@paragraph: Interesting demonstration. You hardly ever see serif fonts being used for government agencies, or law enforcement for that matter. But is the typeface itself communicating that authority, or are we conditioned to respond to that font in such a way because, through repeated exposure, we now associate it with the qualities and values represented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation? In other words, are those qualities imparted on the typeface by the context in which it is used, or is there something innate about that font that lends itself to communicate authority?

I would venture to guess that government agencies choose sans serif fonts not because they communicate authority, but because many of them tend to be colder and less personal than many serif fonts. However, I may be way off.

It's going to be very difficult to generalize the findings of this study across all applications. If you will be using law firms, for example, I think that your conclusions, however significant, will only be applicable to law firms.</div>

I was once told by a non-designer boss that I <em>had</em> to use Helvetica, because it was the “industry standard”. Who knows where he got that idea; needless to say, I didn’t work for him for very long. The choice may often be due to simple laziness, too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, before you can come up with a precise and useful experiment, you'll have to do a decent amount of background research, and this is what you asked for here. Nobody's really giving you many references, and this thread is becoming more brainstorming. I think this is partly because few rigorous studies in the area exist.

In order to study this, you'll probably want to review a bunch of existing documents and see how authoritative they seem to you and analyze their typography in general. You'll probably want to try to find old accounts of type too.

I've had the same question as you but about small caps in particular. People seem to love them at my school, and I think it's because they look fancy and official to these people. (Long ago, I used to be one of them.) I read a lot about the history of small caps, but I'm stuck at figuring out exactly why this attitude came about. I think I'd have to find old letters to explain this.</div>

Don’t. Politicians are notoriously inept when it comes to designs, and will gladly pick type and colors with no thinking and reject any thoughtful design that comes their way. I know political consultants who go through this over and over and it drives them nuts.</div>

I agree with Paragraph. What happens if your research suggests the opposite - that sans-serifs are actually more authoritative than serifs? Do we defend serifs anyway? The only way in that case would be to purposely only seek and present data that supports the serifs argument. I hadn't noticed that a lot of us tend to fall into this trap of making up our minds before we've begun (including myself) until a professor pointed it out. Interesting thesis by the way!</div>

In order to conduct research like this you will probably need support from a supervisor with a strong background in experimental psychology to help you, and the equivalent of a second year psychology course (usually called Psych 2000), some stats and a few labs. If you plan on being published in a peer-review journal as opposed to a design magazine &c you may need to go through ethics approval (nightmare) as you're using human Ss.

This is why I suggested that the experiments explore how typeface choice affects the credibility of a message perceived to have authority rather than assume that a typeface imparts authority directly. To further your example, a stop sign is both authoritative and a warning that one obeys for the sake of self-preservation. Using a wispy serif, or even comic sans, probably has no more impact on the credibility of the message than a heavy sans, because most people still don’t desire to blow through an intersection and get sideswiped by a truck. But I’m not sure that this would be the case with highway signs restricting carpool lanes to a car with three occupants—in that case drivers are already resentful of the authority behind the sign and its policies, and a break with the sans norm might discredit the message and lead to it being ignored. And of course this is all culturally relative!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Both the FBI and Stop sign examples were what I thought of first as well. Type as voice is important, but as Nick points out: context is everything.

I think that the comparison of serif vs sans would work best with words that are out of context or are perhaps not even words. Would "glakbp" be more authoritative in Times or Arial? But then we run into the other big problem: which serif and which sans? Perhaps a family with both, such as Meta and Meta Serif or Scala and Scala Sans (to name two), would help to minimize the problem? Unfortunately, serif type and sans serif type both come in 1,000s of variations. So, really, your study would be dealing with one serif style vs. one sans serif style. I don't think you can make a definitive distinction with such broad terms.

I suspect, as I think many others here do, that this study is subject to so many fluid cultural factors that the data would only really be valuable as a continuum of samples taken regularly over an extended period of time and in multiple geographic locations. Many of us here are designers and we all have robust toolkits for manipulating perception that could probably subvert the outcomes of the study pretty easily. In eliminating the variables designers use to inject meaning and provide context to content, you would be removing the study so far from the reality of type as it's used, that I'm not sure if the data would yield information of much value beyond an extremely narrow case.

I'm happy to hear that you're interested in examining type's effects, but I think a further refinement of the study's parameters is in order. I recommend that you educate yourself about type, then pick the aspects you want to study. I believe serif vs. sans is simultaneously too granular and too broad to allow for conclusive and meaningful results, because type performs such a unique role in the world.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I recall c.1980 working on various accounts.
Some were industrial business-to-business advertisers, and for those one used Helvetica, Futura, Univers, Franklin Gothic...
On the other hand, for the National Ballet of Canada, classic serifed faces such as Bodoni, Garamond, Goudy, and the then new Pontifex.
Now, the corporate face of the National Ballet is Helvetica 55.

Also back then, typeface choice was considered to be an important element of brand differentiation, so at the typical small-town intersection there would be a bank on each corner, each with a different corporate face: Century Oldstyle (National Trust), Palatino (CIBC), Plantin (Scotiabank), etc. Now all the banks here apparently use Frutiger/Myriad.

So, as a cultural study (rather than an ill-conceived quiz posing as meaningful research), it appears that this is a complex issue involving time and place.

Why is it that 30 years ago art directors considered a variety of serifed faces suitable for bank advertising, and now a homogenous sans?
Is type choice a decision of clients, creative directors (with an eye on status/awards within the creative metaculture), or an accurate reflection of what consumers best respond to?

All of the above, in a dynamically evolving system with multiple feedback loops, an element of chance and perhaps some technological determinism.

This proposed research may be useful as a snapshot, to compare with future snapshots, but IMO a cultural study should study culture, not masquerade as science, because the only way behavioral science is of any use to creative design is in product development.

I've decided on defining authority/status as a construct made up of believability (not credible/credible, not convincing/convincing, etc.), expertise (unskilled/skilled, unknowledgeable/knowledgeable, etc.), and trustworthiness (unreliable/reliable, untrustworthy/trustworthy, etc.). Participants will be questioned on their perception of the author of the text, one group receiving a serif version, the other a sans serif. I haven't decided on the content of the text itself, but it will be about half a page in length, as opposed to my earlier idea of doing law firms, etc.</div>

You could gather data from 100+ Ss in less than an hour, and material prep would be a snap. In experimental psychology, we call experiments like this "paper and pencil" which are great as they are easy to set up.

		<div class="commentbody">But how do you make sure that the design of the test document isn't biased towards either sans or serif?
"What designers do" is to harmonize and optimize all the variables in a design.
Real designers don't design documents where type style may be changed willy-nilly: you change one thing, everything changes.
So Thomas, could you produce a page design for a real-world document, such as an invitation to a seminar, where the text type may be changed from serif to sans or vice versa, without skewing the effectiveness of the document?
And bear in mind that the majority of design work, such as Typophile, for instance, mixes serif and sans.
So consider the relative "authority" of say, a serif body face, when combined with either a sans or serif headline.
The tonality of the piece as a whole, and by extension, the effectiveness of the body type, depends on the relationship between the elements. 
A page with serif body text makes quite a different impression depending on whether the headline is set in serif or sans.
Also, should the headline be light or bold weight?
And to measure the effectiveness of a document with only body text is irrelevant.
As I said before, people don't read typefaces, they read documents.

Very cool idea. But, as Christopher pointed out, a correlation wouldn't have internal validity unless you are able to control for all possible confounding variables. There are so many other reasons that a student might attend or not attend a seminar. Even if results are statistically significant, it would be foolish to assume causation.

No. I used to work in advertising, so I have some experience with market research and working with focus groups--for developing advertising campaigns, not products.

<em>It has been my experience that most designers “shoot from the hip” and are somewhat resistant to a structured scientific approach to problem solving.</em>

That's because they are designers, not artists or scientists.
I'm not quite sure what you mean by a scientific approach to problem solving, but it sounds like the kind of thing which would kill a designer's creativity, resulting in boring, unappealing design. 
It's not true that the process of graphic design is unstructured--you can't study design at college for several years, learning the institutional methodology, then work in an industry with a vast ecology of trade practices, and be a wild creative genius--although we do like to promote the myth.
What a designer needs is good taste, an eye for detail, and a sense of which way the cultural wind is blowing.
These are not qualities that can be understood by scientific principle.

Mr Dean, how can science be used to develop good taste?

First, quantify what people like, then give it to them?
By the time you do that, they will have moved on.
So how do you give them what they <em>will</em> like?
How do you decide when a particular market will become jaded by a certain look, and embrace the pendulum's swing?
When to switch from this:

Correct me if I'm wrong, but conventional wisdom would seem to dictate that sepia-toned photography, combined with a logo and name that look like they came from a 19th century Savile Row outfitter, and text set in a classic serif typeface (even more prominent in the poster for the new CD) would not be "authoritative" with teenage girls!

		<div class="commentbody"><em>I don’t know how to define “good taste”</em>

In typography it can be taught, and learnt through practice.
Good taste is instrumental in designing a document which is appealing, a pleasure to read, and communicates well--qualities which people like when they're reading--hardly the cause of Armageddon.

That's not to say that good taste is a fixed set of preferences, rather, it's a discriminating eye.
So a group of designers may all have good taste, but their tastes will vary amongst one another, and over time.


<em>...if “staying ahead of the curve” means figuring out clever new ways to sell more boy-band albums to teenage girls...</em>

That's exactly what it means, it's how graphic designers make a living.
From clients who want clever new ways to sell more of a particular product or service to a particular target market.
The nature of the product and market is immaterial, although professional bodies do have standards which draw the line against certain practices--though not against designing for boy-bands.

I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with this statement. Graphic design cannot be summed up that simply. Yes, part of being a good designer is using sound reason, but there is a much larger, intangible part that is intuitive by nature. I find that good reason can be taught, but artistic intuition is something you are either born with, or not. Maybe intuition is the wrong word. I define artistic intuition as a quality analogous to raw intelligence–like IQ. It is at the core of an artist's style and can be seen in the conceptual scope and vision of the artist, rather than in the execution of a particular technique. It's easy to see this in music. Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Kurt Cobain to name a few obvious examples. None of these musicians were particularly polished or accomplished vocalists or instrumentalists, yet they possessed unique artistic vision, taste and intangible sense of balance and proportion that allowed them to create something wonderful, despite their technical shortcomings. I don't think that had anything to do with conscious reasoning.

[Edit]
It's imagination. You simply can't <em>teach</em> imagination.</div>

I don't see why not.
After all, "Scientific Reason" is well established, and equally simple.

What has intuition got to do with graphic design?
Intuition is without reason, yet design is problem solving.
How can a problem be solved without reason?
You think about the problem, you think of a solution to it--and that's not reasoning?!

I don't buy the "born genius" argument.
What about the 10,000 hours?

Those who don't understand how something has been done often assume that it's magical or intuitive, and that's how a lot of people consider graphic design, eg "shooting from the hip".

I don't think it's "born genius", so much as it is born with a certain capacity for creating art. Is this turning into a nature vs. nurture argument?

<cite>Those who don’t understand how something has been done often assume that it’s magical or intuitive, and that’s how a lot of people consider graphic design, eg “shooting from the hip”.</cite>

I'm not saying that hard work and education doesn't pay off. And I'm not saying that graphic design is without reason. I am only saying that some people are born without much capacity to be creative. Some people are simply born with limited imagination, and will never be able to make great art, no matter how hard they try. 

I'm <strong>far</strong> from being a genius; but I believe that when I'm inspired, I am a better designer and artist than your average person (as are most of us on this forum). And for all the reason and logic and problem-solving that goes into the design process, I <cite>know</cite> that there is an aspect unexplained by reason – something that just clicks when inspiration hits. It feels as if the answer is presented to us and all the puzzle pieces fall into place. The ability to start with a raw <em>feeling or emotion</em> and turn it into something you can see/touch/taste/smell/hear can be explained by reason, but the origin of that feeling to me is unreasonable.

		<div class="commentbody"><em>1. Add new knowledge (needs no explanation)</em>

That's doubtful.
The science of reading is fascinating, and may spark new design directions, but the use people want from it, such as "this typeface is 5% more effective than that typeface", can never be a scientific proposition, or a practical benefit.
So far all I've ever come across from the science of reading is completely useless to practice.
Sometimes it's the "discovery" of something very basic that is well know to typographers, but generally it's along the lines of Pauli's "That's not even wrong", such as the Song & Schwartz assertion that Arial is better than Mistral for recipe instructions.

<em>2. Support some of our conventions, traditions, intuitions &c with scientific reasoning and empirical data which only adds strength to our position</em>

It might seem that a "scientific" rationale could help the professional esteem of graphic designers, art directors, and typographers, but the opposite would occur, as technicians and "smart" software would derogate true design thinking.

<em>3. Refute some of our conventions</em>

If it can't support, it can't refute.

There IS a place for scientific methodology in the practice of design.
In product development, and in market research.
But in both cases, science cannot prescribe what a design will be, it can only test the efficacy of a particular design against a specific set of parameters.

In product development (for typefaces), there is no need for lab-testing of typefaces, because the market soon enough determines what works. I've used focus groups in the development of newpaper type, to help choose between different possibilities, but that's as scientific as it's got, I can't imagine more thorough statisitical research fitting into a commission workflow.

Microsoft had the opportunity in typeface development to use lab testing to refine the ClearType faces, but AFAIK did not, instead merely using testing post facto to justify design decisions. The same has happened with various "typefaces for the reading challenged" projects: what happens is that someone with little or no experience in type design gets a grant to develop a typeface for, say, dyslexic readers, then they develop a typeface according to their theory of how people read, but they never test existing designs against their theory, or against their new design. And then well-meaning NGOs or government agencies will use or mandate the typeface, instead of far better typefaces from established commercial foundries. This short-changes everybody.

Market research has been used for consumer products for at least 100 years. Daniel Starch was a pioneer. It began, early in the era of mass-market consumer culture, with the idea that science could be used to produce more effective "salesmanship in print"--but the scientific method has made no further inroad into the art of selling. However, scientists are nothing if not confident, and the latest generation of scientists always thinks it can do a better job than previous, that we are just on the doorstep of understanding how everything works. But that's a fallacy, as any philosophical critique of scientific reason will point out.

Finally, I would say that the "better reading through science" agenda is not legitimate science, but scientism and quackery, and this is why it deserves debunking.
The scientific study of reading, in the realm of neuroscience and social psychology, is entirely worthy, but beyond that, science can never be of prescriptive use to typographers, and is counter-productive to the true nature of typography and the work of typographers.

Nick, would you care to elaborate why you say this?

FWIW, to throw in a different angle: I would suspect the problem is just that most scientists and most typographers/type designers, respectively, live in different worlds; yes, they don't ask the same questions, in fact they often don't speak the same language, they don't understand each other. But that doesn't mean they can't, or couldn't, ever. 

In the end, if science researches the very processes that we as graphic designers / typographers / type designers address and rely on &ndash; the nature of how humans see, perceive, and <em>read</em> &ndash;, don't we <em>need</em> to be interested in that? 
And if they research it in ways that we find inappropriate or pointless from our angle; if they ask questions we don't find relevant; if they lack knowledge we could provide (and maybe don't even realize), shouldn't we try to step up to them and communicate this, try to bridge the gap &ndash; instead of refuting science altogether?

Maybe I'm naïve, or idealistic; but I wonder if this isn't a prime example of a situation where building bridges between isolated disciplines could do so much to make them see each other more clearly, and work to each other's benefit. Yes, that would be difficult. But not only would it help type (immensely, I think), but taking walks on both sides of such a bridge could be one hell of a lot more interesting than throwing grenades across the divide.

My $.02. Maybe I misread what you said? This got a bit epic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>how do</em> you <em>define “typographer?”</em>

The typographer is the person who makes decisions about typeface choice, size, leading, and other typographic parameters in a document.
So even a person customizing their browser interface is, in a sense, a typographer.

<em>Nick, would you care to elaborate why you say this?</em>

I already have, in numerous Typophile posts.
However, ultimately I think the issue is philosophical, concerning the limits of scientific reason.
I don't see these issues being addressed in the psychology of reading, which seems to be stuck in a retro behaviorist mode. 

<em>shouldn’t we try to step up to them and communicate this, try to bridge the gap – instead of refuting science altogether?</em>

Refuting science? Demarcating it is doing the opposite, reinforcing its integrity.
Science can enlighten as to how reading works, but it cannot offer prescriptive advice to typographers.
That's not science, but quackery and social engineering, and should be vigorously debunked.

The methodology of specific experiments by reading researchers has been repeatedly critiqued (trashed, even) at Typophile, and I think you will find that has happened earlier in this thread. If scientists want to be taken seriously by typographers, they will have to better address the issues raised, and steer clear of "Arial vs Mistral" tests in the first place, and then back off trying to justify them as legitimate baby steps.

Finally, why should one build bridges to aid those who seek to destroy one's calling?
They don't recognize, understand, or believe in the value of typography as craft, and think that it should be reducible to an objectively manageable practice. As Christopher Dean puts it, "I also conduct experimental research designed to support or refute typographic conventions in accordance with objective measures of human performance and empirical data."

Nina, did you catch the Rock 'n' Roll museum presentation at Typo Berlin, where the designers said they were told by officials that for accessibility reasons, the type on the walls had to be 24 pt sans serif? That's where this path leads. 

There's no denying technological progress, after all that's the history of typography, and we all benefit from it.
But believing in progress isn't the same as giving technologists carte blanche to administer "adapt or die".</div>

I mean if –hypothetically speaking– I were working on typesetting a book and a scientist would find that the book would do slightly better in terms of readability if it had 0.5pt more leading, or if the type was slightly smaller and the measure shorter or whatever, is that already "prescriptive advice"? 
Further, if I were to accept this input, and consequently attempt to balance the complex system of variables that typography juggles in a slightly different way, so as to better accommodate the scientific findings, and find a compromise between them and my initial, visually guided concept; and if I then find it still "looks good" (if slightly different), but now with the added benefit that it supposedly also <em>works</em> better, then haven't both sides won?

<cite>"They don’t recognize, understand, or believe in the value of typography as craft, and think that it should be reducible to an objectively manageable practice"</cite>
What makes you say that? The sentence you quote from Christopher Dean's post doesn't sound like wanting to "destroy your calling" to me, exactly. More like trying to counter-balance fuzzy anecdotal wisdom with empirical findings. 
First step to building the bridge: try to see the value in other approaches to finding truths. Or at least stop being terrified of them (or conversely, looking down on them). 

But just to clarify: I do think there's a huge difference in the usefulness of science to us between the realms of the functional and the æsthetic. Which means I'd laugh at that same scientist from above if he told me I need a font with serifs 10 em units longer to make the Average Person perceive it to be 10% more "authoritative"! Especially so if said scientist were unaware of the complex overlapping effects of all those variables in typography. 
(Whee, did I just get this back on topic?)

<cite>"Nina, did you catch the Rock ’n’ Roll museum presentation at Typo Berlin"</cite>
No! I'm beginning to think I really missed a lot of good bits. :-\</div>

No, that's "let's try all the permutations and see what works best" product development. 

<em>The sentence you quote from Christopher Dean’s post doesn’t sound like wanting to “destroy your calling” to me, exactly. </em>

"objective measures of human performance" means design-by-formula, turning graphic designers into robots.

<em>More like trying to counter-balance fuzzy anecdotal wisdom with empirical findings.</em>

My "anecdotal wisdom" is nothing of the sort, it is in fact empirical know-how gained in the laboratory of commerce.
It is not fuzzy but finely honed, enabling me to discriminate between, say, Meta and DIN (both of which I have experience spec'ing in printed projects) for setting recipe instructions, rather than the extreme generalizations of Arial and Mistral, which is the state of the art for reading scientists.

		<div class="commentbody">Exactly.
Let's start with a definition of type size.

<em>...is that already “prescriptive advice”?</em>

OK, so we'd like to be able to say something along the order of "10 pt serifed type is more readable" (as determined by objective measures of human performance).

But how do I, as a type designer, design a 10 pt serifed type?
I don't, I scale according to the em square.
Ignoring the fact that there isn't a definition of the em square which typographers can agree on (as emerged on a thread at Typophile), and that scientists haven't even addressed this issue, considering foundry/layout application definition of "size" as axiomatic, I have to ask:

1. Are those serifs slab or bracketed, and are the terminals ball, square, or adnate?
2. Is type size determined by cap height or x-height, and then, what percentage of em square is that height?

That would be prescriptive advice, but without it, all science can do is performance reviews of specific typefaces in specific documents.</div>

With Ahmadinejad victory conflict in Iran government still present
Elections have caused a rift within the political elite

The Iranian authorities are likely to succeed in suppressing the street riots that  arose after the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But the rift that has developed in the political elite seems permanent.

Rotterdam, June 14. Continuing street protests in several major Iranian cities underlines the belief by many Iranians that the electoral victory of the radical-conservative President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was the product of fraud. But there is little doubt that the authorities will succeed in suppressing that spirit.
