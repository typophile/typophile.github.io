body: "Can anyone recommend, or give me advice on, existing Korean OpenType or TrueType
  fonts? \r\n\r\nI am looking for typefaces that have Hangul, Hanja and Western characters...
  Also, I am looking for one family of three weights that could be used as the visual
  equivalent of a sans serif face, and another family, also of three weights, that
  could be used as the equivalent of a serif face, if that makes any sense.\r\n\r\nSo
  far I have only had some luck searching on the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/webshop/view.linotype?viewmode=search&searchFields%5B%5D=0&searchFields%5B%5D=2&PHPSESSID=cb342d00773ea7b59a5f6423d5f8c985&ACT=quicksearch&searchLogic=and&searchContent=true&wildcard=1&searchType=as_families&GROUP=&DISPLAYC=full&searchTerm=korean\">Linotype</a>
  site (but they only have two weights of each face) and the <a href=\"http://www.monotypeimaging.com/ProductsServices/wt_fontsample.aspx?type=korean\">Monotype</a>
  site (they don't sell their non-Latin fonts online, but they don't reply to the
  form they ask you to fill out, either!).\r\n\r\nAny tips on other foundries or distributors
  will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "As far as I know, Korean font vendor websites are not easy to use for those
    who don't speak Korean. So I'll just list a couple of major foundries and a selection
    of recommended fonts. I'm only listing the more traditional text faces, although
    if you are looking for a specific style then I could help you with that. All of
    these include Hangul, Hanja, and Western coverage (although I haven't checked
    for every single weight), and all are available in TrueType. I'm guessing most
    are available in OpenType as well.\r\n\r\nSandoll - http://www.sandoll.co.kr/\r\nSandollmyeongjo(\uC0B0\uB3CC\uBA85\uC870)
    is the foundry's flagship serif-type face.\r\nJebi(\uC81C\uBE44) is a more modern
    serif-type face that I admire.\r\nSandollgodik(\uC0B0\uB3CC\uACE0\uB515) is a
    sans-serif-type face.\r\nEach of these comes in three weights.\r\n\r\nYoon Design
    - http://yoonfont.co.kr/\r\nThe Yoonmyeongjo (\uC724\uBA85\uC870; serif) and Yoongodik
    (\uC724\uACE0\uB515; sans serif) series come in an impressive array of weights
    and proportions. Yoonmyeonjo is probably the most used text face family in Korean
    publishing today because of its versatility.\r\n\r\nAsia Font - http://www.asiafont.com/\r\nThe
    Asia bonmunmyeongjo (Asia\uBCF8\uBB38\uBA85\uC870; serif) and Asia bonmungodik
    (Asia\uBCF8\uBB38\uACE0\uB515; sans serif) families each offer six weights.\r\n\r\nSM
    Font - http://www.smfont.com/jikjisoft/html/font_sm.htm\r\nThe SM3 Font family
    includes 7 weights of serif faces and 6 weights of sans serif faces. I prefer
    the SM3 family over the SM2 family due to its better spacing and better Latin
    components. Both are included as part of the SM font package, and the website
    doesn't seem to sell each family separately.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bitinfor.co.kr/pdf/Adobe%20Bundle%20font.pdf\">This
    PDF document</a> showcases the fonts that come bundled with the Korean edition
    of Adobe InDesign, which include most of the fonts I've mentioned.\r\n\r\nI can
    do more research if you need on the pricing and ordering."

    check everything out; this is very useful... And thanks for offering to do research
    on pricing and ordering -- I have a couple of co-workers who speak Korean, so
    they might be able to help out with that part. No need for you to spend more time
    on this! :-)\r\n\r\nThanks for the tip and the PDF about the Korean edition of
    InDesign, as well.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nR.\r\n"
