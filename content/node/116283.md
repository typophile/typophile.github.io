    digitized by Berthold as Palette BQ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/palette-bq/
    I have not checked, but I expect that the Bitstrean digital was done independently
    without using anything digital from Berthold.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks for the extra information Don.\r\nYes <strong>Palette</strong> outlines
    look a bit different from <strong>Brush 455</strong>, in fact that's why I mentioned
    <strong>Brush 455</strong> because it looks like a better match to the given image
    sample."

  body: "Good call Fivos. BTW I have always appreciated the effort Bitstream put into
    producing well engineered fonts. Berthold seems to emphasized fidelity to the
    original metal versions and generally avoided \"improvements\" consisting of increased
    regularity.  Slightly different objectives. Both foundries produce superior quality
    fonts.\r\nDon"
