  - I can't read it. Can anyone of you? \r\n\r\nI like the attitude, like it's something
  of a medieval piece of text, something like that. Anyway, it looks odd.\r\n\r\nWhat
  about it, please?\r\n\r\n"

    body: "You're smart. The places you left open, are just those letters which i
      changed a bit, that is to say i replaced the dotted ascenders into regular ones:\r\n\r\nh
      - d - b\r\n\r\nAlso the x is different in the second sample.\r\n\r\nEventually,
      i wanted to create a readable bitmap font, in the smallest grid possible.\r\n(well,
      the first sample isn't readable at all without introduction, i know, but it
      was just a false topic start).\r\n\r\nThis font requires a maximal grid of 7
      x 5 (h x w), seems quite small to me.\r\n\r\nThere is, by principle, no meeting
      of horizontal and vertical lines, in order to keep the letterforms 'open'. (that's
      why i changed the shape of x).\r\n\r\nBy the way, the first sample is medieval
      Dutch; the first 2 lines of Van den Vos Reynaerde (Reynaert the Fox).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC04104_5890.JPG]"

  body: "Oh, I see. I thought the dots were meant to be diacritics.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of tiny bitmap fonts, one of the smallest I've ever seen was KRN by Tilman. It
    was only 3 (three!!) pixels high. Unfortunately, it's no longer available on his
    website http://tint.de/\r\n\r\nIt looked like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ms_KRN_4570.gif]"
