body: "Hi Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm very pleased to announce that [[Beorcana]] is finished
  and released: all 28 fonts. [[Tal Leming]] did the final mastering, and there were
  many helpful people who critiqued the shapes, diacritics and performance. It's been
  a ponderous undertaking. My intention was to produce a workhorse book typeface without
  serifs, with display variants, for general use. I think it's successful, but I'll
  be very interested to see how people use it; a typeface comes to life with use.
  \r\n\r\nFont will be posted for sale on fonts.com in mid-January.<!--break--> I'll
  be updating www.beorcana.com with more information and a better specimen PDF when
  I come back from vacation in January."

  body: "Wow \u2014 that is in my opinion one of the best typefaces released the last
    couple of years. I also love that it\u2019s something that even can\u2019t be
    compared with all the \"look-a-likes\" of the somewhat \"trendy\" typefaces that
    are released from different foundries all of the time.\r\n\r\nThis is far more
    unique and it\u2019s letterforms will definately live a long life far beyond all
    of these trends.\r\n\r\nI will definately remember Beorcana, and eventually buy
    it, as soon as I find a project to use it for.\r\n\r\nSalutes from Sweden! Great
    work!"

    mean making sure that the font naming convention, kerning table, etc. adhere to
    the established standard \u2013 like its term equivalent in audio recording?"

    easily or with as much confidence as Tal. \r\n\r\nPaul, e-mail me your postal
    address and I'll send you a specimen poster too."

  body: "Beautiful. Seeing a hard copy at many weights is even more impressive than
    seeing it onscreen. It scales amazingly well. And, as others have noted, it really
    shines in very small captions...legible yet still very much itself.\r\n\r\nSomehow,
    someday, I want to work with this font."

    makes Optima and others of that persuasion seem dated.
