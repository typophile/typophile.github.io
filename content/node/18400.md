    50 years in England. \r\n\r\nAnd (at least in the U.S.) 2-dimensional reproductions
    of 2-dimensional works can't obtain intellectual property rights. Unless the 'repro'
    adds additional creative content somehow. And unless the 'repro' is actually a
    collection of reproductions (as the collection itself can be rights protected).\r\n\r\nI
    am, of course, no lawyer."

    you mean the content, Wikipedia says: \"Parliamentary copyright of a literary,

    Wikipedia says: \"Of ordinary works, copyright in typographical arrangements is
