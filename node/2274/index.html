  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey guys, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm new to the board and this is my first post. I've read through quite a lot of these critiques and value your suggestions. I am starting my own film/commercial company and have had the name True Caliber for several years. I am just now hunkering down and trying to devise a logo. Here is my newest design, number 43,902: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No but seriously I have done logos for other companies, but can't seem to crack my own.

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Roger, welcome to typophile! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is a very interesting mark you having going. Good idea with the 't' 'c' lig. Should the red circle be a bit smaller? Or perhaps the glyph needs to be wider? It seems to me that there is too much red space on either side.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for true caliber, maybe try another typeface?   I'd like to see what everyone else thinks about that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the positioning of everything, the mark may work better beside true caliber, rather than being centered on top.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like how the red circle is a bullet hole, or maybe the back of a bullet. Perhaps you could develop on that more, by adding a ring around the edge or something? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just some thoughts <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Drew</div>

If you are, in fact, trying to portray some kind of bullet hole as Drew suggested, then maybe you can simply position a red circle behind the &quot;t&quot; and have some skattered red circles resembling bullet spray</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all your feedback thus far. I'm actually trying to shy away from the whole gun connotation. I am using the word caliber for it's meaning of quality, thus &quot;true quality&quot;. I have tried different scenarios with guns or gun imagery, but it's not the type of image I want to portray with the company. I want something along the lines of like the Psyop logo (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.psyop.tv">www.psyop.tv</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) or Res (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.res.com">www.res.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) Somethign that represents cutting-edge, but also can be a timeless mark if the company survives that long. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Erik</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can't stress how much stronger your first concept is compared to these. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since this is a production company, some subtle animation would be appropriate. The logotype (from your first posting) lends well to animating appearing/disappearing pieces of type. One method might be to start with a solid block and tear out chunks to reveal the letterforms, then randomly have pieces/chunks of the block reappear, then disappear again, and so on (i.e. the counter of the &quot;e's&quot;, the bowl of the &quot;b&quot;, the chisel of the &quot;t&quot; arm, etc.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree with you on the type. Here I've kept the text but worked up a variant of the logo. In my opinion the most important element to me is the logo mark itself. Once that's engrained in people's heads that's all I would have to show.

It's bold and instant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daniel: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yeah I want to have some pizzazz but at the same time have a sense of stability and timelessness.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Roger, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm new here as well, so please forgive me if my insights aren't so insightful. I'm learning too (albeit slowly ;-). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm agreeing with Daniel, Dominik and Scott: the red circle version is the strongest. I wouldn't sweat the swoosh thing. There are some swooshy shapes, but none is individually a dominant element, and the feel isn't that arcy, swooshy curve. It's more of a vortex feel, drawing the eye into the center of the logo. The square version of same is my second-favorite, though I like it more each time I look. Perhaps try using a similar but less-compressed face for the 'true caliber' to develop more horizontal motion, like the lig is a point on a timeline. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The newer versions&ndash;the solid black type-only&ndash;don't do so much for me. The gothic 'TC' ligature reads as a 'T' to my eye, and there's too much whitespace between it and the 'aliber'; looks like a hole. Where the red circle/square draws the eye into the ligature itself, the later versions draw the eye into a hole. The first is better in that respect, but there the lig feels too heavy. Maybe slim/reduce the back side of the 'T'? Or use a contrasting color for the interior stroke? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, you might try splitting up the 'ib' ligature. Part of the strength of that face is the verticality, and connecting the dot on the 'i' and the serif of the 'b' interrupts a particularly strong vertical and, to my eye, disturbs the rhythm of the face. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last, I think you're going to get 'gun' inferences from almost anything with your name. 'Caliber' is just very closely associated with firearms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

The waist looks a little pinched to me; that might help make it feel more generous. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the i, I tend to agree with Chris - it occurred to me that you have a great opportunity there to use a right-triangle shape for the dot and reinforce your type's feel in what's right now not the most interesting glyph.  The t is excellent; all of &quot;true&quot; has a great diagonal force that &quot;caliber&quot; doesn't, maybe because you have two strongly vertical glyphs interrupting the diagonal movement.</div>

To me it looks like a logo for some homogenized software company. Sometimes it's not about whther looks good, but whether it feels good. This could work for my film company if I wanted to be a little more freewheeling with the stories I want to tell, but I definately want to make hard-hitting and challenging movies. Think of flicks like Traffic, Fight Club, Seven or the commercial work by Chris Cunningham and Spike Jonze. Irreverant, experimental, but always, always unpredictable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So have I got you guys sold? How could I improve on this one? I did take into account your input on the 'i' so I stuck a dot right back in there. As far as the negative space in the middle of the ligature I like the fact it draws your eye to the middle and from there you discover the rest of the logo. I definately didn't want to stuff up the logo anymore then it had to be. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tinch <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I totally agree with the difficulty in designing one's own logo. It took me over 6 months to come up with my other logo, vdefilms.com, and that was the first design I had mocked up! Anyhow I appreciate your feedback and like the gun imagery you added to the logo. I do however want to stay away from anything that shows guns specifically. I'm looking for a mark that can stand on it's own and hopefully one day become synonymous with great films. Also my newest revision reflects the highly stylized and serious tone most of my films portray. As well as melding the new (the true aliber type representing digital filmmaking) with the old (the Old English styled TC that represents a strong foundation in classic storytelling). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tinch</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like what you did with taking out the 'c' and pulling the 'aliber' in closer. It gets rid of the negative hole as well as make the logo flow better. I did originally try lining true up a little higher to make it look stepped, but it just looked too severe and disjoined.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm liking Scott's solution to the 'aliber' as well, and I agree with him regarding the notch on the first 't'.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll also second the concerns about the e-t join. I'm not sold on the 't/c'-'a' join&ndash;though that's better than the other. Maybe try reworking the t-c lig to avoid joins with either word? Or maybe just flatten both curves a touch so they don't join at all? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also agree with you regarding the horizontal composition. Maybe you could dodge the joins and strengthen the horizontal in one swoop by reducing the x-height a touch? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regardless, I still find the 'lib' spacing a teensy bit awkward in Scott's version. I definitely like the independent dot on the 'i', tho. Maybe BJ is onto something with a triangle for the dot of the 'i'? Also, rather than reversing the serif on the 'l' I might try ditching it entirely&ndash;or maybe that's an opportunity to reuse the notch from the 't'? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, I think the 'er' join is a bit awkward with the tail (or whatever the correct term is) on the 'e' sticking up like that.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HHP, You know what I was thinking about that too! For readability sake I am threw the 'c' back in, but also condensed some things to lessen the negative space in the ligature which was one of the main reasons we took the 'c' out in the first place. I was even able to incorprate the tail back into the 'c' which was a pleasant surprise. I re-did the ligature a bit and used the same arc for the top swoop that was used for the bottom swoop one to give it more sense of consistency and flow. Sorry if it seems if I keep going back and forth with stuff, but everytime I either step forward or backward it gets better so please bear with me. I am also trying the word cinema instead. Another stamp of 'seriousness' that I would like the company to have. Suggestions? Death threats? let me know. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BJ, Jeff, Yes that is Senator Ultra font from the Emigre family slightly nipped and tucked.

Listen to bj about the type, and where did the spur come from on the l when everything else is a slab serif. You have a type logo and a mark. Two different things. Think of CBS they have the eye (mark) and CBS type (logo). Work on the elements separately then figure ways to combine them. Problems are easier solved if reduced to smaller chunks of information.

		<div class="commentbody">Roger, I hate to be a partypooper, but I think that you have too much spice in your recipe. Did you switch to CINEMA from FILMS for a reason other than just to test the waters? It is probably too small for certain uses. The way you've created almost a ligature from the way you've joined the words and letters, while interesting, is perhaps too tricky. It could be read, by the casual glance as &quot;true T caliber&quot; or &quot;true C caliber&quot; it is almost redundant. In some ways, I think your original post is still the strongest. You used color and shape and placement to separate. You had a &quot;mark&quot; that could be used separately when necessary. The &quot;nipping and tucking&quot; you did to the emigre face is very nice, you should focus on that, and find a way to create a separate mark.</div>
