  guys,\r\n\r\nNeed help with this one. I think im on to something here. The client
  is a little latte wagon that runs on electricity. Like a little moped/car that has
  a latte machine in the back... a very kool little thing. The client did not have
  a proper name for it yet. But i like the name OPEN COFFEE. The client said something
  like COFFEE 2 GO. But it was a bit too obvious I think. I  dont want any clich\xE9s
  like the coffee mug etc or beans (for the symbol). Need more outside of the box
  than that i think. Its a very kool little coffe-car. \r\n\r\nBut i mostly need help
  with a SYMBOL. And no i dont want a vector image of the actuall car itself.\r\n\r\nThanks!
  \  \r\n\r\ndaniel"

  body: I like the clients input. It is coffee to go (car, go). Don't over think this
    one make some simple signage. Maybe it should be latte to go, makes it a bit more
    upscale.

    was working for me he'd get a very harsh caution about mistakes like this. Next

    to the dentist and let the client tell the dentist what to do. Stupid clients.\r\n\r\nSorry.
