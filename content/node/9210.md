body: Hello all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been pulling my hair out trying to identify this
  font, can anyone help? So far, I know it isn&#39;t any of the ITC Kabel typefaces
  &#40;which look very similar&#41; but I&#39;ve found that it could be quite an old
  font as quite a few books dealing with Archeaology and Africa &#40;from as early
  as the 1950&#39;s!&#41; have used it. I&#39;ve also seen it in quite a few movies,
  most notably in Jurassic Park on the Visitor&#39;s Center banner exclaiming &#34;When
  Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth.&#34; <BR> <BR>Any ideas?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65170.jpg"

  body: P.S. - I&#39;m not that familiar with the movie, but the publicity materials
    for Jurassic Park &#40;and the millions of knock-offs/parodies that followed&#41;
    used Neuland. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neuland/neuland/testdrive.html?s=Jurassic+Park&amp;p=48"

  body: 'Conman: Lithos was made in 1989, so it&#39;s probably the Neuland you were
    seeing in archaeological books. If you can post samples, I&#39;d be interested.
    <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll probably also enjoy this essay: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.studio-gs.com/neuland.html"

  body: Raph, thanks for posting that link. The essay was quite interesting. <BR>
    <BR>I note that <a href="http://www.bajafresh.com/" target="_blank">Baja Fresh</a>,
    a California-style Mexican restaurant chain, uses Neuland extensively on their
    website and in their signage. I don&#39;t think there is an African connection
    here, but the &#34;stereotyping&#34; described in that essay might be operating.
    If we replace African with &#34;aboriginal culture&#34; this might link to &#34;Aztec&#34;
    and thence link to &#34;Mexico&#34;. It&#39;s a bit of a stretch, I admit. However,
    it might explain why the graphic design seems to work, even though it&#39;s quite
    jarring when one considers Neuland&#39;s history. I suspect most of Baja Fresh&#39;s
    customers are unaware of this history.
