    drew the Cyrillic, Greek, and Hebrew in 1983 when the font was issued. If anyone
    knows any further information about this, please help! thanks. \r\n\r\nThanks
    for trying sii"

    employee John would have got a credit, foundry people usually don\u2019t. One
    place to check would be design-patents, if these were applied for anyone significantly
    involved in the project should be named."

    called Helvetica World, released in 2004. This had nothing to do with Helvetica
    Neue. In 1983, John Hudson was in elementary school. \r\nA."

  body: "Neue Helvetica was developed at D. Stempel, Linotype\u2019s daughter company.
    The studio manager was Wolfgang Schimpf, his assistant Reinhard Haus. Manager
    of the project was Ren\xE9 Kerfante. I was the design cosultant and designed the
    literature for the launch in 1983. Lots of small ads for the trade press, spelling
    HELVETICA, a weight a letter. And a brochure in A4. I was also involved in the
    discussions about applying the Univers nomenclature to Helvetica. Wolfgang Schimpf
    was the man who, in 1985, oversaw the digitization of PT55, later to be released
    as FF Meta."
