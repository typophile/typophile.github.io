  body: Right! It's more of a condensed face though. Good thinkin' about the upside
    down stuff. Because of the source, I really think it unlikely that the designer
    really finessed the type. I would've thought that they bought this stuff out of
    a box somewhere... Thanks for the help so far IN1.
