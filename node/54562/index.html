Another typeface I absolutely love is <a href="http://www.raissaki.gr/pages/work.html">Elpis</a>, available through the <a href="http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces20th.html">Greek Font Society</a>. I think Elpis is a beautiful typeface, and I love it especially because it includes Greek characters (something I wish was more standard).

The Droid family of fonts, used in Google's Android, is also pretty nice (it's available in different places, if you google for it).</div>

I bought Gotham because I wanted to use it extensively for some posters last year (which I did and I don't regret the purchase).

I might use something like Cambria as my main serif since I have it... I'd like to avoid spending a lot of money since I've already spent quite a lot on fonts.

And thanks I will check out LaTeX, I've been meaning to look into that, its been recommended to me in the past.

		<div class="commentbody">My personal experience is that if you use anything other than Times New Roman or Palatino, university professors will give you a lower mark and make comments about your style choices. They are suspicious that the different aesthetic of other fonts is the student trying to cover up a lack of quality research. And since they none of them actually have enough time to read your paper from beginning to end, they have <em> no choice</em> but to assume that there is something wrong with your paper. I'm dead serious about this.

If you <em>really</em> want an alternative font that your professors won't get suspicious about, try using Monotype Baskerville. That's about as far as you should go.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I should probably clarify what I meant in my last post. What I meant is that if you try using a font that professors actually notice, then you risk losing marks. I have been told this by more than one professor. For example, when I've used my Marquet font then nobody notices, so its okay. But if I use my Garamont, then teachers get suspicious because its too "fancy" looking (long extenders are a no-no for profs). 

That being said, if you're looking for text face for non-academic use, then you are free to choose—and here you will want to get the best quality you can afford.</div>

I'm talking about (a) getting written comments on papers from profs who don't know this, and (b) differences on the marks of papers of similar quality with different fonts. Anyway, I don't mean to derail the conversation, here. I was just trying to give some advice based on my experience. I've also received similar comments when using one of the new cleartype fonts; I think it was Constantia. When a prof says "use 12pt Times or equivalent" they mean use a standard windows text font. This might well be different in a design program, or at other universities.

I should also mention that one professor thought it was really cool that I was using a font of my own making. In this case there was no effect on the mark.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OIC. It depends entirely on the prof. Most profs don't even notice a change in font. But if they do, the result is usually negative whether or not its mine and they know it. That's what pleases me of using Marquet. I get the pleasure of asserting my personality on the work but I don't get dinged for it!

When it comes to "appropriateness" for academic papers, though—as was originally asked—TNR can't be beat. It's what professors expect to see. Plus it's got every glyph you'll ever need,looks decent on screen, and prints well on any crappy 600 dpi printer.</div>

Then again, I didn't get the perfect GPA I had in my previous Master's program... maybe I should blame my typeface selection.  :)

What JP says about profs and typefaces completely rings a bell with me. When I was in graduate school a million years ago, I remember going up to the department one day to pick up my mail and overhearing a wistful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Brooks">Brooks</a> sigh: "Oh, I absolutely <em>love</em> Palatino." That got around like wildfire, and almost overnight no one was turning in anything anywhere that wasn't set in Palatino. I actually like Palatino now. I didn't like it then.</div>

Would you mind noting some of the differences between Times and Times New Roman? Which is preferable in your opinion and why? Thank you. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Palatine:

Here are a few of the many differences between the two cuts. One of the biggest is that the "F" is substantially narrower in TNR. TNR has sharper serifs in general. TNR has vertical serifs on the S, TR's are angled. TNR has a K in which the arm and the leg join the stem in a V, while TR's K leg sprouts off the arm. Ascender serifs are at a flatter angle in TR, and cut off vertically instead of at an angle as they are in TNR. The "t" has a bunch of features cut off at right angles in TNR, which are angled in TR.

Cheers,

		<div class="commentbody">I only ever did a careful comparison of some glyphs of the roman (upright, regular weight) face. In the context of the forged document I was looking at, that was the overwhelming majority of the text, maybe all (I'd have to go back and look).

I wouldn't be surprised if there were even bigger differences between the two cuts in the italics or bolds....
