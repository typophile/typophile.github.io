  to disadvantaged families, but also provides shelter for battered women, educational
  opportunities, and other family services. They've been around since the 60's and
  got a bad wrap after a scandal so their new motto is \"Proud Past, Promising Future\"\r\n\r\nThe
  word Baby is in the name and since daycare is what they're known for, I'm looking
  for a typeface to reflect a youthful, growing feel, but not childish. Any suggestions?"
