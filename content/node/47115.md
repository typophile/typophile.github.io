  all over the homepage, \u201CQuixote coming to Myfonts\u201D. \r\n\r\nSurely you\u2019ve
  admired Batin and the sweet suite, Suite.\r\n\r\nThere is also another site which
  features graphic design from the Textaxis people.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.extraestudio.com\r\n\r\nIn
  this site you\u2019ll see the custom face Santander:\r\nhttp://www.extraestudio.com/proyectos/santander.htm\r\n\r\nLike
  Plantin with out looking stubby.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    last we spoke it seemed like he was concentrating on other things right now.\r\n\r\nIt's
    not a replacement, but if you like Quixote, have a look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/custodia_ot/\">Custodia</a>."
