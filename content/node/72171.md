body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm puzzling over what the problem is, with using @font-face.
  I was wondering if someone can tell me if this is an issue in setting up the embedding,
  a problem with the creation of the font itself, a browser issue, or something else
  entirely.\r\n\r\nHere's the problem.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, when embedding a font
  using @font-face, the tails or extenders somehow get rendered clipped. Also, sometimes
  the baseline or topline (did I make that up word?) get rendered all wobbly and wonky.\r\n\r\nNow,
  due to licensing issues, font embedding legalities and such, I'm pretty limited
  to what typefaces I can use. I recognize it's possible it's just a poorly constructed
  font. Any help would be appreciated. See my image attached, for an example.\r\n\r\nThe
  specific font I'm puzzling over now is Linux Libertine, but I've seen this issue
  elsewhere, as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    more testing, I found that the \"U\" is appearing at the same size at 14px and
    15px. So when the type is set at 14px, it all looks wobbly. Oddly, as well, the
    clipped tails go away when not on 14px, too!\r\n\r\n"

    It's a \"fun\" problem!\r\n\r\n@devi\r\n\r\nThe clipped lowercase \"g\" might
    be due to an absence of a line-height setting in the CSS. Does the g get clipped
    like that without another line of text underneath?\r\n\r\nThe spacing also looks
    extremely tight and I'm wondering why.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the capital \"U\"
    is the hinting. How does it look in, say, Chrome as an CFF? Same thing? Or is
    it just TrueType?\r\n\r\nrich\r\n"

  body: "@tevih - I KNEW you were going to say that. The autohinting definitely works
    better on some fonts than others. At such small sizes though, not many fonts are
    going to look good in Windows without a lot of man-hours hand-hinting them.\r\n\r\n@Khaled
    - Interesting. I will try to integrate that hinted version into our system.\r\n\r\n@David
    - One man's trash is another man's treasure I guess. I know you've invested your
    life into this... but when will you be delivering the goods? I've seen some of
    the screen-font work you've done and it is impressive. We're all standing by though
    waiting for webtype.com to show us how it is done."

  body: "@ Richard\r\n\r\nA CSS line-height setting is not required. Fortunately,
    because I assume, that there is still a problem with Firefox! (Firefox spreads
    out the line height differently in case of units like em and pt, because they
    have to be converted to pixel. The values have to be rounded, but Firefox rounds
    up <strong>and</strong> down in the same text block with the result, that some
    lines are 1 px higher than others. I see this at once and I hate this behavior
    of Firefox. I am not sure, if it is meanwhile fixed.)\r\n\r\nI assume there is
    something wrong with the dimensions of the font. Some values are wrong chosen.
    (Not all programs make use of the same values! On Windows there is nothing clipped
    in the font preview.)"

  body: Indeed the webfonts sometimes get "Wobbly". Its worst if you have a transform
    rotate CSS propriety on. I think that its not especially due to the low font quality
    as much as is a browser misbehavior. Try to do see the page in an WebKit browser
    like Safari or Chrome. Their font rendering engine is better. Line-height, even
    with negative values, do not cause "clipped tail".
