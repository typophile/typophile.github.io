body: My classmate and I (grad students at the Rhode Island School of Design / amateur
  type designers) are trying to dig up some information on one of the IBM Selectric
  (II/III) typeball fonts - Artisan. We've found some scans of it online, but nothing
  on the specific history of that face (designer, year, etc), or any specimens larger
  than type size. If anyone has any leads, or knows who to get in touch with, that
  would be much appreciated!

    Or, for that matter, about Adjutant (12)/Delegate (10), which to me looked almost
    like a monospaced adaptation of Goudy Old Style. '
