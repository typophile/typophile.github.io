  body: Great color combinations. Work is very nice, only thing I don&#39;t like is
    &#34;knock- out&#34; circle behind logo on the brochure. It feels a bit too computer
    generated and breaks <BR>the flow.

    -i tried to put some more assymetry to brake the stict structure of the logo.
    Good that you noiced it because i really wanted a view on this. <BR> <BR>I forgot
    to mention that the blocks in the B solution are representing the aegean landscape
    &#40;with the caracteristic architecture: white squared buildings, blue windows
    and small churches floating on the sea&#41; since the organization is focused
    on the South Aegean region as it mentioned at the subtitle. <BR> <BR>christos'

    I went outside for a smoke thinking about your design and came to the conclusion
    it would be worth suggesting that you make the blocks island shapes.  <BR>Well
    it appears you have already thought it out. Nice work.  <BR>As for the knockout
    circles. Something should be done.  <BR>Where are you based?

  body: I have to disagree. I think the et as ampersand could work. I think the reason
    that it is calling so much attention to itself is because there is too much word
    spacing.

    be wider, but here it is distinctive and balanced. Rotis does have some strangely
    proportioned letters by traditional standards, but they do look distinctive and
    elegant in display.'

  body: Widening the &#34;T&#34; is actually pretty mainstream. <BR>In a font you
    want it slightly narrow because the lc letters following it need to get tucked
    in. But in lettering &#40;especially letterspaced like this&#41; the glyph is
    more comfortable and harmonious when it&#39;s wider. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hmmm. The wider T looks stronger, but the narrower more distinctive. My feeling
    is that whatever you think of Rotis, it has a very well thought through and distinctive
    look. I would think that if you want a broader T, something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/perpetua-2/perpetua/testdrive.html?s=ISTOS&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Perpetua</a> might be a better bet. However, I think your original
    for the logo is elegant and distinctive already.

  body: I think the weight of the Rotis Bold does match better with your illustration.
    I don&#39;t think there is a big difference between the wider or narrower version
    of the T and L. However, to me, the striking thing about these Rotis caps is their
    apparent uniformity of width, which sets up a certain rhythm that is striking.
    You disturb that a bit by making the T and L wider.

    symbol. T-O-S can be tightend further, ever so slightly though...the top bar in

  body: Very nice work, i like it a lot. <BR>From your proposals in the initial pdf
    you posted i favor variation A. The floating sinedots remind me of a mediterranean
    landscape. I agree with Ole that the circular cutout is too harsh, if you need
    to contrast the logo from the background i would go for a blurred and non-linear
    shape cutout. <BR>Variation B is also nice, but a little too busy. Maybe if you
    would focus on the architectural reference, that is a great idea. <BR>Variation
    C is too much like snow/winter to me. <BR> <BR>The logo is beautiful, once you
    got the spacing and kerning worked out one the type. Everything that i noticed
    has been mentioned by others before.

    the programme is supported by the EU but it is not an EU programme,  <BR>so it

    Though i also agree with Ole,  <BR>still i didn&#39;t find a way to avoid the

  body: Very nice - very very nice - one of my favorites on this forum. I think dodging
    the lines around the logo will work somewhat. Just be wary of logo placement and
    you should be fine. I love the layouts too - very excellent work!
