body: "Here is a Python script that dumps to the output a utf-8 input file. The script
  works fine on Linux but if the input contains characters above U+FFFF it does not
  behave as expected on the Mac with whatever version of Python I use (I tried with
  Python 2.5, and 2.6 on OS X 10.5, and with Python 2.5, 2.6 and 3.1 on OS X 10.6).\r\n<!--break-->\r\nHere
  is the <code>dumpchars</code> script:\r\n<code>---\r\nimport sys, codecs, unicodedata\r\ninfile=codecs.open(sys.argv&#91;1&#93;,\"r\",\"utf-8\")\r\ntext=infile.read();
  infile.close()\r\n&nbsp;\r\ndef dump(char):\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; try:\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; print('%04X %s' % (ord(char), unicodedata.name(char)))\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; except:\r\n&nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; print('%04X' % (ord(char)))\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nfor char in text:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;
  dump(char)\r\n---</code>\r\nIf, on Linux, (even on the <a href=\"http://laptop.org/en/laptop/index.shtml\">OPLC</a>)
  I run <code>python dumpchars in.txt</code> on the file <code>in.txt</code> containing
  a line with the characters a, b and a CJK unified ideograph (that makes Typophile's
  editor crash, so I had to remove the following line)\r\n\r\nI get\r\n<code>\r\n0061
  LATIN SMALL LETTER A\r\n0062 LATIN SMALL LETTER B\r\n230B7 CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-230B7\r\n000A\r\n</code>\r\nas
  expected. If I do the same on a Mac with any version of Python, from 2.5 to 3.1,
  I get this:\r\n<code>\r\n0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A\r\n0062 LATIN SMALL LETTER B\r\nD84C\r\nDCB7\r\n000A\r\n</code>\r\nCharacters
  above FFFF are not handled properly. I get that same output on a PC (I tried with
  python2.6)\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a solution to this problem aside from always
  having to rely on a \"Linux box\" ? \r\n\r\nMichel"

  body: "Michel, \r\n\r\nunfortunately, by default Python is compiled in the UCS-2
    version so it only supports Unicode BMP. It's possible to install Python from
    sources in the UCS-4 mode, but it means you need to do some compilation. It's
    also possible to install the UCS-4 version of Python from MacPorts (using Porticus).
