  Unicode Ms.ttf' font file that supports all the characters-Unicode font. Likethis,do
  we have anything for AFM. Give me some examples.\r\n\r\nDo we have any AFM fonts
  for Eastern European languages. \r\n\r\nThanks and Regards,\r\nVidya Viswanathan"

  body: "AFM is a text format that only holds metric and kerning information for Type
    1 fonts. Since a Type 1 font can contain an arbitrary number of glyphs, and the
    glyphs are referenced by their names, the AFM format also supports it. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
