    that the gallery isn't really\r\nopen in general... The only \"official\" opportunity
    for\r\nus to see the exhibit is tomorrow night. I'm open to the\r\nidea of going
    as a group, although rainy traffic could\r\nbe a deal-breaker for me.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    release that was sent to a local graphics group I belong to (Kernspiracy). \r\nMaybe
    we'll meet up there if the rain doesn't turn Santa Monica into a cludge. At least
    it's not on the west side\u2026\r\npeace"

    the far east end of Santa Monica boulevard - so I'll most probably be there (along
    with some of my students it seems).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    they allow kids. :) I''ll call  tomorrow and find out.'

  body: "So I made it to the exhibit (with most of my students) and got to finally
    meet our Lauri. Another nice thing was getting to talk to Ed Fella in person -
    he's a cool guy. Paul, were you there? If not, you missed the brownie / red wine
    combination, which was surprisingly synergetic.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit itself seemed
    mostly 15 years late, if you know what I mean. But to be fair some of it was good,
    especially the pieces where it was interesting to try to reverse-engineer the
    thought process of the designer/artist.\r\n\r\nOne thing that struck me was the
    initial caps\r\nof Hagmann's upcoming Odile (at Village).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Odile.gif]\r\n\r\nIs
    it me, or is it -in part- a tribute (pardon the pun) to Frank Heine?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    and had to make a big decision - the guitar won out. It was sublime so I don't
    regret it but I do wish I had the chance to meet you. Maybe we can go to Carousel
    sometime, although you may get that tremendous Armenian/Lebanese food at home\u2026\r\npeace"

    did.\r\n\r\nPaul: Carousel! Cool. I wish the Hollywood location hadn't closed\r\ndown
    though. Same great food, half the price, for some reason.\r\n\r\nWe'll make it
    happen.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to their version of mouhammara, I have never tasted anything close. I too miss
    the Hollywood location. The owners used to be there all the time, they were so
    nice. I never asked them about it but the guy who turned me onto it was Lebanese
    and he said they ran a restaurant in Beirut for years but had to leave due to
    the strife. Sound familiar?\r\npeace"

    a type conference in Beirut, remind me.  :-)\r\n\r\nYeah, during the war a lot
    of people left because they wanted an actual college education, they feared for
    their safety, or they needed work. Many of them have been going back though. Another
    thing you should remind me: to one day tell you the Story of Zankou.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
