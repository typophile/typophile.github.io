body: "Does anyone have any good tips for left-handed calligraphy? I'm pretty good
  making ogee curves and flourishes with pen/pencil, but whenever I try with a nib,
  the ink never comes out smoothly. I just ordered some new lefty nibs in case they
  were the issue, but I have a feeling the ink flow might be due to my technique.
  \r\n\r\nWhen I use felt-tip calligraphy markers, I get the shapes I want. However,
  the sharp contrast you'd get from steel nibs just isn't there. Unless, does anyone
  know if there're any sharp, thin calligraphy markers out on the market?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.xavierdupre.com/img/sketche04/img002.jpg]]\r\nAny
  idea what tool was used for something like this? "

    on that sketch posted?

    That shows some technique. That's one oddly shaped nib he's holding. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtiupZ2L_U8

  body: "I'm sure you've already used these...but they are pretty sharp and clean,
    you've got to watch the paper your using though. You want some super shiny stuff,
    and very little pressure. [[http://www.cultpens.com/acatalog/edding_1255_Calligraphy_Pen.html]]\r\n\r\nI've
    never managed to get a swelling nib (spencerian style) effect through a marker
    pen, you can cheat, draw a skeleton and then swell out at the right places with
    a fatter pen. It worked pretty good in my graffiti days.\r\nA southpaw nib will
    definitely help, or my oblique holder can reverse? i presume that has the same
    effect with non angled nibs. Also, reverse the angle you approach the paper at
    (as opposed to the way they show you for orthodox).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    are freestyled, and the lowercase is constructed form built on top of a sketch."

  body: This is probably the only useful thing I'll be able to share about calligraphic
    tools here, but we used the Parallel Pen too in the calligraphy classes I took,
    and one thing to know about it is that it uses a *lot* of ink, and the cartridges
    are rather expensive. You can just keep buying those all the time, or you can
    use a syringe to refill the cartridge you have from a larger ink bottle, which
    will yield almost the same quality and will save you lots of $ over the long run.
    (In my case the run wasn't all that long but still. :-)

    would just have to watch the consistency of the replacement ink. I'm always sticking
    edding T100 in anything that'll hold it."

  body: "I grew up using old school flat pens and tried a Parallel\" pen this summer
    at TypeCon. It was certainly easy but very frustrating because the pressure needed
    was totally different than Hunt or Speedball or any of the geezer tools I am accustomed
    to ;-)\r\n\r\nAlso, Arnold Bank, my old calligraphy teach jokingly said that left-handed
    calligraphers were more rare than liquor on Sunday in Lancaster."
