body: "This is a collection of photographs I took on my latest visit to The Museum
  of Modern Art in New York City. The originals are part of the Prints and Illustrated
  Books Collection and the on view exhibitions. The exhibitions at the MoMA only reinforced
  the importance of typography on both commercial and artistic worlds. From the art
  pieces to the museum\u2019s signage, typography is omnipresent at any modern art
  museum.\r\n\r\nThe strongest evidence are the exhibitions:\r\nMartin Kippenberger:
  The Problem Perspective. This exhibition included hundreds of posters he designed
  for his exhibitions (Not allowed to take photographs).\r\n\r\nPaper: Pressed, Stained,
  Slashed, Folded. This exhibition focuses on works on paper, including prints, illustrated
  books, and selected drawings, that explore and manipulate the materiality of paper
  itself.\r\n[[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2009/paper|Click to see
  Paper: Pressed, Stained, Slashed, Folded.]]\r\n\r\nThe Printed Picture. MoMA will
  publish The Printed Picture, a book by Richard Benson that traces the changing technology
  of picture making from the Renaissance to the present, focusing on the vital role
  of images in multiple copies.\r\n\r\nTangled Alphabets: Le\xF3n Ferrari and Mira
  Schendel. Le\xF3n Ferrari (Argentine, b. 1920) and Mira Schendel (Brazilian, b.
  Switzerland, 1919\u20131988) are considered among the most significant artists working
  in Latin America during the second half of the twentieth century. Their works address
  language as a major visual subject matter: the visual body of language, the embodiment
  of voices as words and gestures, and language as a metaphor of the worldly aspect
  of human existence through the eloquence of naming and writing.\r\nUnfortunately
  for me, this exhibition was being mounted while I was in New York\u2026\r\n[[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2009/tangledalphabets|Click
