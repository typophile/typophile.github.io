I think it would benefit a lot from multiple weights.
For example in your first Behance image, "KING OF"

Breaking rules can be incredibly fruitful.
I do it all the time. But I don't break
windows just because I feel like it.

The main problem is the particular outcome
here seems to be <em>entirely</em> self-expression.
Just because it's very hard to make a good
living in Fine Art doesn't mean anti-user
fonts magically become good.

It's important to remember that in a public
discussion the participants are not the only
beneficiaries. If this were a private exchange
I would have stopped a long time ago.

That’s not what I was referring to.
The ascender of the “f” is too short, and the crossbar too low.
It looks like it belongs to a different font.
I’ve seen this mistake occasionally amongst students I’ve taught, and I suspect that you have made the kind of “unfamiliar with the alphabet (script)” error that Westerners sometimes make when designing Cyrillics.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Denis—I like your solution for the "f" and "t" within your overall design.

Aesthetics is completely subjective. Everyone has an opinion.

Always go with your personal "gut feeling" when designing fonts.

Nothing is ever really "wrong".

Never be afraid to break the rules when the design warrants it.

The "quirkiness" of your overall design and the "art nouveau"-"art deco" aspects work effectively throughout the font design.

As an example, the lower cross bar in glyphs such as "E", "F", "H" and "4" harmonize well with similar aspects in top-to-bottom proportions of "B", "R" and "8", and certainly  are mimicked well in your solution for the "f"and "t". In addition, the narrow and wide body proportions further enhance the visual effects. Well done.

The overall design works. I also like the name of the font.

Good luck, and I wish you much success.</div>

I am pleased to learn, but I trust my feelings.
I have Bachelor of Arts degree, and during the 6 years studied including typography.
The main thing which we have trained - to trust self feelings. )))
And if my senses tell me that I was right - I go to a violation of the rules.
I'm not saying that I know all the rules. That's why I show you the my fonts - to listen to the advice.
My fonts is released under SIL Open Font License and I do not need to advertise them to increase sales. )))
My goal - to get your opinion. But I have a my vision, and it may not coincide with your. )))
I'm ready and I want to listen, but reserve the decision - to use or not.
Thank you for your attention, I hope you will always be free to comment my fonts. ))))

		<div class="commentbody">It's better than the average amateur work, and not bad for a first font. A few comments:

- the f looks silly. Nick is quite right. I'm not sure I've ever seen a professional typeface, other than a script or hand-lettered style, in which the crossbar of the f and the t were at different heights.

- some of the transitions from rounded to straight lines, such as the shoulder of the n, are a little too abrupt

- where round shapes meet straight lines, such as in abdpq, you need some optical compensation by thinning the curved part where it comes in to meet the straight. It's not as bad a problem as it would be in a heavier weight, but it still needs a hint of thinning.

- the sidebearings of the A should presumably be the same as the V. But in any case, the round sidebearings could all be a little less, and those of letters like AVTX could all be a lot less.

- there's no kerning. This is a good thing given that the spacing isn't done. But more browsers are supporting kerning now, and you need it in a geometric sans like this for the typeface to be done.

Cheers,

"the f looks silly. Nick is quite right. I'm not sure I've ever seen a professional typeface, other than a script or hand-lettered style, in which the crossbar of the f and the t were at different heights"
-- I really like the "f"... ) I prefer to lower the crossbar of the the "t"... ) But it may look even stranger... 

"where round shapes meet straight lines, such as in abdpq, you need some optical compensation by thinning the curved part where it comes in to meet the straight. It's not as bad a problem as it would be in a heavier weight, but it still needs a hint of thinning."
-- I right now working on additional faces, which I focused on the optical compensation. It will increase from light to heavy weight

"some of the transitions from rounded to straight lines, such as the shoulder of the n, are a little too abrupt"
-- I will take this into account in future versions  with additional faces.

"the sidebearings of the A should presumably be the same as the V. But in any case, the round sidebearings could all be a little less, and those of letters like AVTX could all be a lot less"
 -- I'll check. I worked on Spacings, not apparently (((

"there's no kerning"
-- I did kerning. should be about 800 kerning pairs. strangely why it does not work... (((
