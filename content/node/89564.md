body: I cannot seem to find the post, but I remember a while ago there was a topic
  about creating italics and how you need to shift the characters back to the left
  so they sit correctly within the left and right bearing walls. Someone gave a formula
  or something similar where by calculating the degree of slant, you could figure
  out how far left to shift all your characters. Does anyone happen to know what I
  am talking about, or do I just sound crazy? haha, thanks!
