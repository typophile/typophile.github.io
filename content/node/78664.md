body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to match up the two fonts used below in the word
  Monday. For the first example, I'm stuck somewhere between Dynamo and Eagle, where
  both families offer something similar although not exact. Would anyone happen to
  recognize the fonts used in these examples? Your help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/big
  copy_6719.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monday_5643.jpg]\r\n\r\nAs
  for the 2nd font shown below, this is throwing me an even bigger curve. I can't
  even seem to come close on a match. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monday_v2_4813.jpg]"

  body: "I think the top two samples could be House Neutraface bold. the M and G are
    alternates in the set.\r\n\r\nNITRO is a Latin style with those triangular serifs,
    but I'm having trouble finding ones with straight-legged R's. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nobodoni/nirvanium-nb/\">Nirvanium</a>
    is sort of close, but the vertex on the N baseline is not wide enough.\r\n\r\n-
