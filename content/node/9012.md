  body: I still haven&#39;t found an exact match, but New City DNA from Sign DNA shows
    some strong similarities in lettering. Change the &#39;f&#39; and it looks much
    closer. I wonder if the same artist created both fonts? &#40;The sample is from
    Part 7 of the Script Font ID Guide&#41; <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64441.gif"

    target="_blank">Ms. Madi</a> is close also. I really want to know what this is.
    I&#39;ve looked at over 1600 samples and nothing. Where is this sample from? How
    old is it?
