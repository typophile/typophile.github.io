  inscriptional forms of the alphabet which the Romans adopted from the Etruscans.
  One distinguishing featue of capital letters is that they are of uniform height;
  the absence of ascenders or descenders (generally) is another feature of the upper
  case. These inscriptional forms of the alphabet were also the basis for several
  writing hands that followed, including [[square capitals]] and [[uncial]] lettering.\r\n\r\nCapital
  letters are a feature of the [[Greek]], [[Roman]], [[Armenian]] and [[Cyrillic]]
  [[alphabets]]. These alphabets are classified as [[bicameral]] because they do contain
  two distinct cases.\r\n\r\nWikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_letters"
