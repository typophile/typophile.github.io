  body: '&#62; semi-sans <BR> <BR>Tangent: playing along with your terminology&#42;,
    I would state that most semi-serifs are in fact semi-sanses. We need more real
    semi-serifs - a semi full in fact! <BR> <BR>&#42; Although I have to say it doesn&#39;t
    really work - too confusing. The only place &#34;semi-sans&#34; has ever made
    sense to me is in the Rotis clan. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: To go with Tyfa, I will probably select a Geometric Sans or a Didot/Bodoni.
    <BR> <BR>A family like Interstate will be good with Tyfa. Futura Also, or perhaps
    Nobel too. <BR> <BR>Tyfa is quite unusual style of typeface, and I understood
    clearly that is not obvious. I?m still not sure of my how proposal.

  body: Thank you all. I guess the Juvenis proposal was the more obvious one, as it&#39;s
    one of the rare other creations of tyfa, but i&#39;m not sure it would be what
    i want. I need one with a very bold version. <BR>The JFP ideas seems really effective,
    but a the fact i don&#39;t like much the too-much geometrical ones, futura being
    maybe the less-liked, don&#39;t help. There was maybe Malm

  body: I&#39;m still thinking of Quimera &#40;well, it&#39;s not a sans at all&#41;,
    which has Quimera isn&#39;t a didone at all, but like the tyfa, has looking-like
    serifs. So it rely with JF idea
