  body: It&#39;s an Art Nouveau-era typeface called &#34;Pretorian&#34; according
    to the Dover book by Petzendorfer.  FontBank issued it as <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/vivian.htm"

  body: If you mean &#39;foiled&#39; because I listed an alias version, I would bet
    that the FontBank font predates the DTP one in digital form. The FontBank fonts
    were done in 1990-92. MyFonts says that DTP &#39;designed&#39; Pretorian in 1992.
    The actual typeface was designed by &#39;P.M. Shanks &amp; Sons, Ltd&#39; in London,
    probably 100 years before either digital version.

    sure the one I &#40;didn&#39;t&#41; mention falls in the rip-off category.
