  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Good evening Typophiles,

I have attached my first attempt at a text face. I'm particularly concerned about inconsistencies in stroke contrast and overshoots. Screen legibility is definitely an issue as well.

I am aiming for a very traditional, garalde-ish book font; something in between Hoefler, Arno, Gentium, Sabon etc. … but it's drawn from scratch. (Why the effort? I'm hoping to one day arrive at a free webfont and maybe even at a math family for font-deprived TeX users.)

I'd be extremely thankful for your input!

Sebastian

P.S.: I am afraid only few dare to publicly offer their opinions here. I appreciate your thoughts even if you've never designed a font yourself!</div>

Some pretty random thoughs:
- some letters appear definitely taller than others (a, e, c, for example).
- spacing is too tight, and you'll need some kerning too.
Evenness on screen is a matter of hinting (you could start here: http://typophile.com/node/13964)</div>

I should've mentioned that spacing will be taken care of.

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, this is really your first try at making a font?! Amazing!

Well here are some comments from me. Take with a bit of salt because I'm not at all an expert.

Proportions are very good; this does remind me of Arno.
Terminals on C could be heavier.
I'm worried the curves of D and O may need to be heavier.
Foot serifs on F and P could be wider on the right to balance the top-heavy forms.
M may be slightly too narrow; N too wide?
Upper counter of R seems too high; I think I'd make the top of the bowl a bit darker than the bottom where the leg joins.
S may be falling backwards but it's hard to judge.
Crossover at centre of W may need some offset.

Lowercase
The contrast on e seems a bit too vertical. Particularly the nw segment looks too dark for classical contrast.
o seems to need some optical correction; is it symmetrical?
s may need some more weight in the serifs and perhaps a hair less in the spine.
Left arm of y seems to get rather fat at the baseling.

Numerals
1 could have a larger flag.
6 needs a larger bowl I think.

Great stuff.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The italic lowercase s is optically tilted more, I think it’s the upper terminal doing this.

The italic lowercase w looks spindly on the left side, with the middle being very prominently dark. Shift weight from one to the other.

I think that italic r, n, m are slightly closer to vertical than the letters with straight ascenders. This makes them seem out of place. You don’t seem to be aiming at a very baroque italic, judging by the consistent pen angle, so the differences between them and the others should be minimized.

Your italic p bulges out too much on the top right.

The italic a looks weak at the top, but I’m not sure this is a bad thing yet.

I like the f, and the y is nice as well. I haven’t made up my mind about the k or the g yet.

Great work! Keep at it!</div>

Could it be that the variations in slant are due to my scaling down the image to a Typophile-phile size? Because really, there aren't any. Or then again, maybe that's precisely the problem :-)

Here's a new attempt:

Comments?

By the way, whoever wants to try out today's development release, it's on <a href="http://www.aldusleaf.org">aldusleaf.org</a>. But beware, it's not usable really.

Thanks again!</div>
