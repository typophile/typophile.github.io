  at least a little history on many random fonts i come across, but short of buying
  many individual books, does someone know of a website that is a database of type
  history information. \r\n\r\nI know a bit about the more famous and well known types,
  but for example today i have come across 'Egyptian505SH' which i know nothing about
  but wondered if it had a particular historical antecedant (is that the correct use
  of that word?) other than just being a slab serif?\r\n\r\nSorry if this seems a
  little confused and disjunct, but i'm eating thai curry and trying to do work at
  the same time.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help.\r\n\r\nG"

    I think Dan Reynolds posted about it. '

    don't know a bigger typeface database than myfonts.com. however, there is not
    always an info available. sometimes, you can find some more detailed background
    information on the specific foundry's homepage.\r\n\r\n// alex"

    G\xFCrtler created the typeface family Egyptian 505 in 1967, together with his
    lettering class at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Basel. In fact, the number \"505\"
    in the typeface family's name refers to the school's classroom number 505, where
    the work was done. \r\n\r\nEgyptian 505 is a slab serif style family; during the
    19th Century, slab serif types were commonly referred to as \"Egyptian\"-style
    faces. G\xFCrtler designed Egyptian 505 in the strain of Adrian Frutiger's famous
    Egyptienne typeface; G\xFCrtler and Frutiger worked together on many occasions
    during their careers. \r\n\r\nThe type family is well suited for many uses, including
    magazines, brochures, text composition, business cards, newspaper advertising,
    book jackets, slides, menus, slides, posters, manuals and catalogues. \r\n\r\nEgyptian
    505 won the first Visual Graphics Corporation (VGC) type competition.</em>"

    505 face? Compared to the euro or any digit, the dollar jumps out at you.  Maybe
    it was a subtle political statement :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Actually, I think that the dollar sign looks just fine. It is the euro glyph
    next to it that feels to small, now that I think about it. Of course, while the
    dollar sign probably came from G\xFCrtler and Team '77, the euro symbol was added
    much, much later, and by someone else."

    - that is if you don't mind. \r\nBut perhaps that just being a little too lazy
    i think. Maybe i'll start a type database site myself.\r\n\r\nAnyway thanks once
