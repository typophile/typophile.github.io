body: "Ok, so I am an amateur designer, interested in including a specific kind of
  element in a recent web page design, but can't find anything suitable because I
  don't know what it's called.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/of_6334.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  case the image doesn't work, it is the word \"of\", at an angle, between two stylized
  lines. I see this type of decorative element most often in an antique/vintage typesetting
  context, and is most often the word \"of\", \"the\", \"and\", \"to\", and the like.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a specific name for this kind of thing so I can find a selection to work with,
  either in font or image form?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n-kurt"

  body: "Those are most often called catchwords, I believe. That should be a good
    search term for here and/or Google.\r\nFWIW that one there is from Brothers, which
    is one of the best known fonts for catchwords, which Emigre in this case calls
    \xABword logos\xBB. See here: http://emigre.com/fontpage.php?PBroW.html"

  body: they are also ornamented glyphs. Fonts like Adobe Woodtype contain some of
    these fro the T.J.Lyons collection.
