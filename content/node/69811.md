body: "Hello, \r\nthis is my first post here. I am hoping to get some feedback on
  a type family I have been working on. It's called Handsome, it has nine weights,
  small caps and italics. I think I may redraw the italic numerals as they are slanted
  roman at present\u2026\r\nanyway it would be good to get a response! Thanks very
  much.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.dept-h.co.uk/index.php?/fonts/handsome/]]"

    have DPTH before them I felt it was okay

  body: I'd try to make the perfect right angled corner of /d/ softer, so it wouldn't
    stand out that much. And then I'd try to see if doing the same for /a/ and /g/
    improves the overall look of the font without changing its character too much.

  body: I like it very much. The one thing that bothers me is the r. I'd go with a
    straight, slightly inclined arm that meets the stem a little further down.

    faces.\r\n"

    I would think this would be a pretty clear case of trademark infringement. If
    not, it's merely a really bad idea.\r\n\r\n(Yes, it's hard to come up with non-infringing

  body: "I had a look at removing the right-angles from the a,b,p,& q but the whole
    look of the font is the clash between such geometric details and humanist forms.
    This aspect also determines the look of the lowercase r, l and the 1. There's
    also an optional n form that is without curves and many of the characters have
    curves that become corners: U,u, P, R, B, A etc. Thanks for the suggestions though.
    I have now redrawn the italic numerals:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DPTHitalicNumerals_4017.gif]\r\nCurves-to-corners:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/curve-to-corner_4529.gif]"

  body: "I can easily live with the sharpness of the /a/, /b/, etc. But the /d/ still
    bothers me. I think the problem is that its axis of symmetry <strong>unusually</strong>
    goes NW-SE. The same is true for the /p/, but for whatever reason I'm more comfortable
    with this one.\r\n\r\nI must confess I don't like the /l/ (lc L) either. I'd try
    a bottom like the one of the /t/, or settle on a standard rectengular shape.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the /o/ is composed of two perfect circles, isn't it? It doesn't look so good.
    You should make the BCP handles a tiny bit longer. And then do the same with all
    the other quarter circles.\r\n"

    actual name of the font is still in limbo.\r\nIn an attempt to keep the 'Hands'
    part in the final name, I've kind of narrowed down to two choices\u2026 and as
    the name of the font caused more response than the actual design it only seemed
    right to air these ideas here.\r\n\r\nSo, they are: Handsohm   or   Handsans\r\n\r\nAny

    your own name. Name the fonts for something related to their design or some wider
    vision. Otherwise it's a bit like ABBA or TLC.\r\n\r\nI'm also confused by how
    somebody can trademark a word they did not invent. Sure, them's the rules, but
    I can't fathom the logic."

    Sure, them's the rules, but I can't fathom the logic.\"\r\n\r\nI'm no expert,
    but I think trademarks have to do with protecting brand recognition. If a company
    or product takes on a name that is striking similar to another, also similar,
    entity, confusion could arise as to what's what and who's who.\r\n\r\nFor example,
    even though the car company did not invent the word Jaguar, they have the trademark
    because the name, logo, et cetera are widely recognized and strongly identify
    them. However, it was perfectly fine for Apple to call its OS \"Jaguar\" years
    ago, since \"Mac OSX Jaguar\" is sufficiently distinct, and in a very different
    market, therefore preventing any appreciable amount of confusion.\r\n\r\nCopyrights,
    on the other hand, are a different story altogether...\r\n\r\nThat's my layman's
    understand of it anyway.\r\n\r\n@DeptH\r\nI really like it. Although, I do find
    the p to be distracting. The bowl feels odd to me, even though I can see it is
    constructed identically to the a, b, q, etc bowls."
