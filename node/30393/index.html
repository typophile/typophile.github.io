<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure where I originally sourced this, possibly the Oswald Cooper Specimens book. I haven&rsquo;t seen that book in years, though, and I don&rsquo;t have any scans.</p>

But both take liberties, so IMO something closer to the original would be worthwhile.
According to The Book of Oz, the alphabet (and matching italic) were done for Paul Hollister&rsquo;s book &ldquo;American Alphabets&rdquo;, 1930. This from The Book of Oz:

<p>I may have to make a shorter alternate for that &ldquo;t&rdquo; in addition to the original, though. IMO it&rsquo;s the weirdest part of this set.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a tough question. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to scare off potential users by having that odd &ldquo;t&rdquo; as the default. On the other hand, keeping the tall &ldquo;t&rdquo; would be more historically accurate. I&rsquo;m edging towards keeping any updates I deem worthy in the alternate set.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cooper3_4492.gif]</p>
<p>I do like the tall &ldquo;t&rdquo; in this sample. It gives the letters a high class look. Plus the ligature looks pretty hot.</p>
<p>Do you think Cooper Cagliostro would be a good name for this font?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Cagliostro would be an excellent choice for the name, a recognition of Cooper&rsquo;s great wit and love of language. Cagliostro (the man) was a notorious character. Among his many skills was forgery, hence the juxtaposition here with Actuality, as well as the showing of the two italic &ldquo;t&rdquo; ligatures. A two-word type specimen poem! Cagliostro is a lovely type specimen word in its own right.</p>
<p>BTW, Dave Farey has described Highlander as more of a general piece of Ozishness, rather than a revival of any particular Oz alphabet.</p>
<p>I wonder what kind of a typeface this &ldquo;Cooper Sans&rdquo; would have ended up, if it had gone throught the mill at Monotype, Linotype or some other foundry? On page 81 of the Book of Oz is a comparison of the original lettering of Packard, and the typeface made from it, which might be a helpful benchmark in assessing the degree of regularity you wish to add, in going from lettering to type.</p>
<p>I recall discussing this alphabet with Richard Kegler some years ago, we had both considered making it into a font. I don&rsquo;t know if he took that idea any further; I didn&rsquo;t, although I have always considered it to be an astonishingly beautiful design.</p>
<p>Cagliostro was an important Mason, master of the secret meaning of letters &ndash; another allusion. No doubt there was some connection between masonry, the Black Art of printing, and the brotherhood of commercial artists.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Indeed. Reading about Cagliostro on wikipedia was quite interesting. I finally found a reasonably priced copy of the Oz Book, so I will be sure to view the packard items when it gets here.</p>
<p>I think it would be interesting to make a fully different &ldquo;commercialized&rdquo; version of each letter as alternates. That way the font would be as tricky as Cagliostro himself.</p>
