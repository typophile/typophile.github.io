  body: AFAIK out BitFonter can open and save Palm fonts. In the same time it can
    open and save bitmap-only TrueType fonts. If autotracing is needed, then BitFonter
    can do it, but FontLab or TypeTool must be used to export outline TT font.  <BR>
    <BR>BitFonter 2 will add a bitmap pixel-trace &#40;Flash-style&#41; feature. <BR>
    <BR>Best regards, <BR>Yuri

  body: Hi Yuri, <BR> <BR>It looks like Bitfonter 2 will be the essential tool for
    pixelfont designers. <BR> <BR>When it will be available, when fonlab 5 launches
    or before?  <BR>It will be available for mac or pc first? <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>

    Studio 5 &#40;which will be available for Windows first :-&#41;.
