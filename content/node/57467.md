  body: Yes, i thought that might be the case.  Do you think he just modified [[http://www.linotype.com/305678/refrigerator-family.html|Refrigirator
    Bold]] or did he used another font as a base?

  body: 'I''ve just read in an interview for an catalogue (as far as the eye can see)
    with him that, as he started his art in the 60ties, he searched for a non-dictatorial
    typeface, and he ran into letters of Franklin Gothic Extra Condensed which anyone
    could buy in stationery stores. Than for a long time he used this type until he
    recognized that the people connected this type form with himself. After that time
    he worked with a stencil type called FF Offline, and now he designed his own typeface
    called: "Margaret Seaworthy Gothic".'
