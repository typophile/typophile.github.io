  the outlines of Univers onto Utopia in Fontlab. ZERO adjustment. Stem widths, glyph
  widths, x-height, cap-height, they all match up perfectly.\r\n\r\nThat being said,
  Slimbach did a superb job. Nearly faultless."

    Although I have the non-free versions of them, I felt it would be more appropriate
    to bastardize something that I have permission to edit. I call it \"Utopivers\"

    Indesign or Illustrator, but I do know that the metrics are different so that
    wouldn't work as well."

  body: "@Nick\r\nI know there are a lot of fonts out there that are similar structurally,
    but when you look at the outlines superimposed in Fontlab, the results are uncanny.
    I actually was curious and intended to ask what other matches there are out there
    that people can think of.\r\n\r\nAre you saying that this happens MORE OFTEN than
    we realize?\r\n\r\nObviously, designs from the same creator often match, such
    as Gill's work, or Frutiger's other designs, but how often does a type designer
    create something to match another typeface _without obviously stating that fact?_"

  body: Among other things, this is a nice demonstration of the structural relationship
    between this style of sans serif and serif types based on an expansion stroke
    model and a vertical axis. I've been playing with Karsten's glyph tweaker tool,
    turning Didot into Helvetica and vice versa.

    expect so, if my experience is anything to go by.\r\nFor instance, I have benchmarked
    several faces commissioned for newspaper redesigns against the faces they were
    to replace, in terms of color, apparent size, and copyfitting. Brown Extra Bold
    is matched against Franklin Gothic Condensed in those respects.\r\nI didn't copy
    any of its parameters per se, but tweaked Brown until it was a touch tighter and
    a touch darker. So if you were to superimpose the two faces, no doubt there would
    be a similar overlap to your example.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/target_4999.jpg]"

  body: "<em>... if the advance widths are [identical]...</em>\r\n\r\nThey're quite
    different, but the lower case stem widths are almost identical (though somewhat
    warped), and so is the x-height and ascender height. \r\n\r\n<em>\u201Cthis happens
    all the time without intent\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nI can't speak for other type designers,
    but in this case I had already designed a serif type for the paper, which they
    were using with Franklin Gothic, and they asked me to design a replacement sans
    which matched that serif in style, and Franklin Gothic in weight and copy fitting.
    So my intent was quite clear. Of course, I would have rather designed something
    more original (and I did get that opportunity later with the same client), but
    the challenge here was to do something close yet with a different personality,
    and without point piracy.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@hrant\r\nI first noticed the similarity a while back when I was helping
    my college newspaper's new design director to re-design. He wanted to use only
    free or open source fonts, because he's a FOSS nut from Korea, so I insisted that
    we stick to at least the professionally designed typefaces. Thankfully, the body
    copy was easy, Bitstream Charter and Utopia are both available. Matching them
    with a non-crappy free sans became the priority, and that's when I realized that
    Univers matched perfectly. We would swap them for headlines, and it worked great.\r\n\r\n@paragraph\r\nI
    don't have Fontlab at work, but I can show some outline examples tomorrow. But

  body: "http://www.kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm\r\n\r\nThe Glyph Tweaker tool allows
    you to distort existing outlines in a number of controlled ways, such that you
    can e.g. make glyphs wider while retaining stem weights. It doesn't do it terribly
    elegantly like Tim Ahrens' RMX tools, but unlike them it doesn't require an MM
    font. It works best for very small adjustments, but even these will usually need
    some manual clean-up if you are trying to produce nicely finished details. But
    I'm finding the brute force approach useful, even with the distortions to terminals
    and joins, for looking at what is revealed about the basic structures of letters
    if, for example, one starts with a high contrast design like Didot and reduce
    the contrast so that the stroke are more monolinear, or with a low contrast design
    like Helvetica and increases the contrast to that of a Romantic typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GTtransformations_6481.gif]\r\n\r\n[More
    of this sort of thing will probably feature in my lecture at St Bride's next month.]"

    never use Helvetica, so that the crappy set widths of Helvetica do not bother
