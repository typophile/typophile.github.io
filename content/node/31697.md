  Description</a>\r\n\r\nI just received an email about this updated product. I know
  a lot of the members here use a Mac-based font management solution (like Suitcase
  Fusion or Linotype Font Explorer X). \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm actually curious if anyone's
  had the pleasure of testing this product out? Is it really worth the $50 upgrade
  cost? Does it add any new features (other than Vista support?) I've been using Suitcase
  9.2 for a long time now, an updated version would be nice, if there's any merit
  to the update. Also, what happened to version 10? \r\n\r\nI know there's a few Extensis
  people on this board, do you have any information to add? "
