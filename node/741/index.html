		<div class="commentbody">Gerald Lange, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You seemed to be confused. But I have taken it upon myself to help you. Us middle aged white males are supposed to be kind to the young uns because we know so much. It's hard, young uns like yourself can be pretty cheeky and sometimes, just gol danged rude. But I'm going to give it the old school try. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know, I don't expect any thank yous. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Pascal60.jpg referred to by Joe was posted by Hrant on Tuesday, June 24, 2003 - 11:00 pm: Go have a read for yourself. Write that date down nice and careful like.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But . . . Joe refers to my post of June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am. Go over it nice and slow like now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Follow! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe's words, notice the date now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And it seems to me that Mr Giampa's post regarding  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am was exactly correct. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->W is for Wednesday, it is not for &quot;winnuendo&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just knew you could do it. But just to be sure I have included, in quote, the following post, dated. Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - 12:53. See for yourself, write that down nice and carful like. Now I'm testing you boy, did you notice how I spelled careful?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I should have been a teacher. I am a very patient fellow as we all know. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now I just love quoting myself. Here she comes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Posted on Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am:   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I see what you see, only I read it differently. I see cleaning out the corners. The metal must be clean or it will not relieve when cast. It will &quot;hold&quot; when the type is removed. What I can see is evidence of gravure slippage, or manipulation error on the top crotch of the &quot;h&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the &quot;b&quot; if your theory was correct the punchcutter has lost control. Please draw your eye to the top bowel-crotch of the ascending stem. Either the top crotch is an error, or the bottom crotch an error? Take your pick. There is no need for one without the other. If you take issue to the nature of stems and placement compare the situation on the companion areas of the &quot;d&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So no more yeah buts . . . please!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If &quot;ink trapping&quot; were &quot;the intention&quot; the application &quot;should be even&quot;. His work, as you can easily see, is not that fussy.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or, lots of theory, little ability to apply.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Meaning this artifact lends little support to your hypothesis. If he is cutting ink trapping intentionally he should have enough skills to apply hisprincipals evenly throughout. I am not disparaging the beauty of his letterforms in fact the cut-look-&amp;-feel is integral to the very beauty. The crudeness is in effect, much more than secondary to the design.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But &quot;ink trapping&quot;, come come.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These letters are much as if they were cut in linoleum or wood. Those are the characteristics which come easily when using similar tools such as a gravure. There are large and small gravures. Tools, including needles are used in small point sizes or tight areas. These cuts are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;humongoumamouth&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking at these letterforms I see forms worked by mostly a single gravure, large by type cutting standards. Certainly it, possibly them, would be used only in the crudest of work when cutting an 8 pt. character. Probably, not even then.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The very nature of these letterforms does not required fine gravures. The large gravure(s) have given the design the intended emotions of thedesigner. Cutting emotions. I suggest a more finished look would have greatly reduced its appeal.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you view the crotch in the Q you will see a place where it would &quot;certainly deserve&quot; the &quot;ink trap treatment&quot; you refer to &quot;if the punchcutter believed as you&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I see a punchcutter seeking a-cut-look-&amp;-feel to his letterforms, and getting it. Forgiving people such as yourselves for mistaking them to be either faults, or &quot;in your(s) case(s)&quot; inktraps in order to achieve the characteristic nature of the letterforms that have drawn our attentions. By the way, which because of the tooling, are acidly beautiful.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You have to love it for what it is, not for what you want it to be. You should remember that boys, and the girls shall be forever thankful.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is an acid sharpness throughout, and I suspect lots of &quot;gravure&quot;, little &quot;file&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a general crudeness throughout and if you notice the &quot;h&quot; has another mis-cutting on the top left curve. Also if you view the beard of the same character you will see a flatness on the lower portions of the gravure straightening into perpendicular at the top of the stroke meeting closeto the same error. He is giving a lot of meaning to free handing and that I believe issues much of the beauty of this particular typeface.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I highly recommend that some of you consider cutting types yourselves. The impossibility is merely an obstacle in your minds. But remember, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->there is few of us left. Contact Jim Rimmer.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald Giampa  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lanston Type Company &quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->End of quote <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So Mr. Lange! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe says,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And it seems to me that Mr Giampa's post regarding  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am was exactly correct. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Re-read my post and tell me something intelligent! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald Giampa <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lanston Type Company <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">At the risk of getting my (virtual) head smashed for this comment&hellip; the most absurd about all this is that the whole flame war began with a discussion about hot metal tye. I mean, how few folks in the Western World share a love for metal type? How few folks still work with it &ndash; couldn't be much more than a few dozen, maybe hundreds, right? I know I only get to work once with it (not me personally, but with a printer realising a design with movable type) and I loved it, just as I ove steel engraving and all that old-school stuff. But still, from the few folks left who in this digital age dig the idea of handlettering with lead letters and all that, you still manage NOT to celebrate the joy of your common fondness for type, but instead you argue and quarrel. Reminds me a lot of the comic-book-forums where in a dying medium fnas and creators alike are rather often thannot at each others throats. This has absolutely NOTHING to do with personality (e.g. John Byrne and Peter David both are nice guys individually, but get them together online and they can't keep from &hellip; cyber-vomiting on each other). Same story here. Sometimes its fun to watch, mostly it gets depressing after a while as it is the internet-age counterpart of pissing in the snow.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If this is actually keeping people like Joe or Erik or whoever fromposting here, we're all loosing out big time. There's a lot of folks hanging round here whose work I positively admire (and some whose work Ilearned to admire by getting to know them here :-), and I frankly fell off my chair when I saw that Erik Spiekermann had written a post or that Yves Porch</div>

		<div class="commentbody">*commerce impedes cultural progress.* <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The dictionary in our office provides this definition of &quot;commerce&quot;:  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.

Intellectual exchange or social interaction. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although the first definition might not serve to encourage cultural progress directly, I have trouble understanding how the second aspect of &quot;commerce&quot; could do anything but encourage cultural progress. Isn't it difficult to engage in the &quot;buying and selling of goods&quot; without involving some social intercourse? This &quot;social&quot; part of commerce, admittedly along with many other things, is what I believe contributes to cultural development. It's not the money changing hands, it's the dialogue that preceeds the exchange of money.</div>

Then I have that problem of tracking down the info to reorder. I bought several Dwiggins designs when I was in Reading but hell that was a lifetime ago now. And no I don't back up.

But your average Joe probably picks Comic Sans since it doesn't look like CG Times or Book Antiqua. But it did go through my mind when I was in Florence and across from the hotel there was a Trattoria with Comic Sans painted at 1 foot letters for its sign, all around the building. What was going through there mind? And the bank machines in Italy? Who made that descision, 'Oh this looks readable, let use it.'??? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just wish the guys who made CG Omega, Book Antiqua, Palacio, or Swiss got all the stick I get for Comic Sans, at least I can be happy with the memory why I made it and not to piss off a historically relevant type designer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Funny thing is I don't think I've ever used Comic Sans for anything, oh actually I have it in the MSN Messenger but I'm not sure I picked that myself.</div>

I just don't dwell about that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Designers are free to look at whatever they choose. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am aware (from looking at 1:1 overlays of it that I've made from high quality scans), that there are popular faces out there from currently well known and respected designers whose characters - designed much later than mine - basically lay right over top of letterforms I designed by hand for some of my more popular faces, with little alteration, renamed.

You know how you keep saying much of your presence here is to prevent influentiable young'uns from being led astray by me?

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;No, not attack. Just side-step.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Like you keep doing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I guess you mean: like you've kept on doing, throughout this rather spirited type discussion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The pattern loops forever: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) I offer a professionally presented thought, freestanding or in reply to a forum member's question or simply adding a thought to an existing thread, because I think I have something true and well considered to contribute, as a working professional. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) You insult me and/or my clients, sometimes with bigotry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) I reply with professional substantiation, on point. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4) You then either: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a) Insult me further, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->b) run from the subject you started inflammation within, never apologizing for the attack on me or my customers, instead moving on to the next wild sensationalism. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In all fairness, there is a surprisingly multifaceted number five: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5) Sometimes you refer me to a standing article that's not even on point. Or, you try a hurried patch job. Or, you admit 'no empirical evidence'. Or, you quote Bill Troop. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Well, no more of this bitch-slapping for me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aw, shucks. (Mommy, they aren't censoring 'shucks' here, are they??!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Actually, I wasn't&hellip;.er&hellip;doing what you just said. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All I asked for was a professionally presented critique from you, about a subject apparently important enough to you to recommend I find out more about. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To paraphrase you, yourself and You (yes, all three personalities) from an August 12 post of yours: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;It's a shame [you] couldn't seem to handle to heat.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The grease fire on the stove that you chose to start. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Man, you dodge faster than Ricochet Rabbit: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;I'll just choose the issues that can  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;help other people. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gee, I guess that's other than me, isn't it? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I guess I'll never get that in-depth, original thought from you about how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Renard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &quot;mark[s] true [typographic or cultural] progress&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Again, to use your words, and again, only using the delightful <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Renard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as the example you foisted, foist.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh, whatever will I do for help on the subject now?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After all, I never look at other designers' work and Hrant won't even share his type viewing guide with me. Wauuuugggghhhhh! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Well, that was refreshing.)   ;-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And as I mentioned on August 15: I'm still waiting for a non-simplistic, non-naive explanation of 'Circumstantial culture'. I thought for sure you would have come back with - at minimum - photocopied grade school Venn diagrams out the wazoo about it already. Jeez. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, whenever you have time. Between potshots. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;So, specifically who's work do you  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;observe (admire?), and why?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;And I don't mean from 30 years ago. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just can't give it up, can you? You know, Hrant, really. I've had enough insults. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Look, I started discovering type in detail in the 1960s, cross-referencing which designers did what. I've lived with type studying it fairly continually since, and actually participating in the professional side of the industry since 1978. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I spend a minimum of five hours with it daily and sometimes up to sixteen.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have my favorites and I have those whose work I care less for, as anyone would.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are thousands that are somewhere between those extremes. I feel as though I'm always learning, so my heroes are always changing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I actually enjoy it all, and even with most contemporary, horridly drawn stuff masquerading as type, I still try to find its silver lining. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I brought up Tony Stan earlier because he happens to be one whose work seems to have stood the test of time better than many.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To the list:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beware the advice from a quack dispensing medicine with a skull and crossbones on the label.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A slug from a jug of such glug is not likely to cure what ails you.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

A while back I wrote a pretty detailed and generally positive review of the latter, and the only opinion I've changed about it is that -as a usable text face- it needs some -admittedly tricky- optical compensation to convey its &quot;abruptness&quot; consistently across different sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although he's been flexing his talent and great skills in lettering more than type design lately, he's actually developing a &quot;workhorse&quot; font called Paperback - few people know about that&hellip; correction: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->knew<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about that.  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You see, Joe, you don't have to like somebody as a person to take their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->work<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seriously.

What would you say the reason is? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, I spend as much time collecting references and reading up on type as I do posting here (largely thanks to my deep mining of the UCLA library's collection as well as ability to fetch me pretty much anything I want). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why do you have so much trouble getting specific?

Let people judge for themselves. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; an inexplicable disdain for anyone who worked (however successfully) over 5 years ago <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Complete fabrication.
