body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just currently getting started on some research for
  a dual branding situation... and I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s any &#39;master
  list&#39; of fonts that come in both sans and serif &#40;i.e. fedra&#41;? either
  that, or maybe we can compile a list here. <BR> <BR>of the top of my head.. <BR>fedra

  body: 'Since Stone Sans &#43; Serif &#40;late &#39;80s&#41;, foundries have often
    launched related sans and serif designs under one name. But at any point, before
    or after, there are related faces with different names. For instance, from the
    1930s, Gill Sans is Perpetua Sans, and Beton is Futura with serifs.  <BR> <BR>Gerard
    Unger produced a series of typefaces for Linotype, all with a similar skeleton
    but different treatments. Demos and Praxis most obviously the sans/serif &#34;contrasting
    pair&#34;. <BR> <BR>Clearface was the first typeface to be marketed with both
    sans and serif under the same name, in the 1910s. <BR> <BR>Following the lead
    of FontFonts Scala, Eureka, Quadraat, etc., I did a sans version of Fontesque.
    <BR>It gives one a flying start. <BR> <BR>Would it have been easier to begin with
    the sans, and derive the serif from that? Does it cramp one&#39;s style to be
    working on both sans and serif at the same time? interesting questions. <BR> <BR>Generally,
    when a layout uses the sans &#43; serif versions of the same typeface, I find
    it&#39;s a bit flat --- not sufficient contrast. But I can see how using the styles
    for branding might work. <BR> <BR>Do you know of any examples Rob, or is this
    a fresh idea? <BR> <BR>But really, sans &#43; serif is no big deal: Panoptica
    has seven variants...'

  body: Freight is interesting to me. Looks like a wonderful family, possibly due
    for &#39;adoption&#39; into the fold. Any of you agree? Disagree? Also seems that
    Freight is in some holding pattern due to a legality issue. ??

    can say that it is one amazing family that will, no doubt, be used extensively
    in the very near future.
