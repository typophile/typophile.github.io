  body: ' Paco, <BR> <BR>That&#39;s some cool stuff. The lower case &#34;N&#34; seems
    to stand out because it looks capital. <BR> <BR>The font reminds me of Platelet,
    for some reason, not that I&#39;m saying there is a derivation. '

  body: ' This font was inspired most in Peignot and a typeface designed by Hrant
    Papazian &#40;wich name i do not remember&#41; wich idea was to increase legibility
    by increasing the diferences between pairs of letters. <BR> <BR>And the &#34;n&#34;...
    mmm... the font that Hrant designed used a &#34;n&#34; like capital... '

  body: ' i like the &#39;personality&#39; of this font... <BR> <BR>and the way to
    test its variations is also very nice... <BR> <BR>i think that lc h is too similar
    to lc k; maybe you should try another shape to make them more distinctive... '

  body: ' Paco, the font you&#39;re talking about was more &#34;conceptual&#34; than
    practical &#40;I&#39;ve never given a copy to anybody&#41;, and it goes by the
    name of MasLucida - it started from the outlines of Lucida - because Lucida has
    the &#34;essential&#34; forms I needed. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s great to see the idea
    used like this, especially in a bitmap font! BTW, your lc &#34;e&#34; &#40;in
    your large outline sample&#41; is one of the most powerful glyphs I&#39;ve seen
    in a while. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Thanks a lot for the comments,  <BR> <BR>Grilo, let me work in some other
    variations, as soon as i have them done, i will post here the results. <BR> <BR>Hrant,
    thanks for your comments, the large outline sample it&#39;s another font in progress
    that will be posted here soon to be criticized, called Sacr&iacute;lega Plus &#40;Sacrilege&#41;
    i want it to be for text setting... so there will be a lot to criticize, and to
    learn. <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot. <BR>=&#41; '

    <BR> <BR>But remember: MasLucida is not a font, it&#39;s a set of structures.
