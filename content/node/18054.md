  my colors are really off. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks

  body: <em>Anything</em> you use to calibrate a monitor is only going to be about
    66% effective, because greens and oranges simply don't translate well from RGB
    to CMYK.

  body: I guess if you're doing webdesign then this is pretty important but for print
    shouldn't you judge colors by print proofs and use swatch books to pick your colors
    in the first place? I was going to post something like what oldnick said, but
    he beat me to it. What's the point of paying all this money to make sure your
    colors are 'right' on screen when they're not really correct at all?

    now is color and related issues and I'm always interested in tips.

  body: "I could be wrong but I'm not sure if there's such a thing as calibrating
    your monitor for WEB design other than ensuring your monitor is displaying the
    broadest range of colours by correctly setting brightness/contrast and gamma levels.\r\n\r\nThis
    can be done with the Display Calibrator Assistant (OS X) or the software enclosed
    with your monitor. As for the preset ICC profiles, I've never had much luck with
    them.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is the fact PC and Macs display on-screen
    colours differently by default. Mac's use a brightness gamma of 1.8 while PC's
    are usually darker at 2.0 or 2.2. Keep this in mind as the colour that appears
    on your monitor will not appear the same on all monitors. \r\n\r\nFor web design,
    use sRGB colour space! You know that already. :)\r\n\r\nHowever I work predominantly
    in print so I use <a href=\"http://www.colorvision.com/profis/profis_view.jsp?id=101\">Spyder</a>
    to ensure my monitor colours represent Pantone colours as accurately as possible.
    \r\n\r\nHope this helps."

  body: "I am aware that not all monitors display colors the same. I'm just trying
    to get mine to display them as accurately as possible for the many out there that
    do have their monitors calibrated properly. Plus, when I select a yellow, I want
    to see yellow on my screen...\r\n\r\nI thought there was an easy way to do this
    calibration. A wizard application that you can use to set up your monitor based
    on an optimizing of the Brightness/Contrast and Gamma to set up a personal monitor
    profile. If I recall right MACs have this wizard built in, but PCs do not. That's
    why this is such a challenge for me. I'm not looking to spend a fortune or even
    really anything if possible. \r\n\r\nI appreciate the recommendation of the Spyder,
    but that's not going to solve my problem. The link I posted earlier only gave
    me a starting point but no real definition as to what I'd need to do to calibrate
    for web optimized colors or the like. \r\n\r\nI still feel lost. "

  body: "Ok. By using the Spyder to create a monitor specific profile, I can cause
    all my apps to display the images using the custom profile. Note, this isn't converting
    the image. I have a third party RIP that also has good profiles so I'm able to
    A.) fix color casts in photography and B.) give a color correct proof from my
    own system.\r\n\r\nThis allows me to get good results with marginal quality digital
    photos that come from different sources, and screen correct them so they match.
    By giving accurate color proofs myself I can show a client what they should expect,
    and keep the approval process on press more streamlined.\r\n\r\nMore detail?\r\n\r\nClearly
    on high-end work I let the press do seps from transparency, but on the low-end
    I can still keep some degree of control and get good results.\r\n\r\nAnother non-Spyder
    option.\r\nhttp://www.gretagmacbeth.com/regionchooser?trgturl=http%3A//www.gretagmacbeth.com/index.htm?"

  body: Color profiles and the ICC have really been a subject of much dispute ever
    since the notion of a "streamlined workflow" came about. I work at a large print
    shop as a pre-press operator, and I prepare files for our offset presses, both
    being Komori Lithrone 40 models, one six color, and the other eight. All of our
    equipment is no calibrated, lol. Do not ask me why, but it just is not. It seems
    that even when things are calibrated correctly, human factors take over, and it
    all has to do with what the customer wants. Regardless of wether the monitors
    are calibrated to the press, or the proofing systems, if at the time of press
    check, the customer is not happy, it will be adjusted on press, or worse yet,
    re-platted. Most all the files that we get, go through numerous phases of retouching,
    proofing, and re-proofing. Nothing is ever right, until the client says it is,
    no matter if the print matches whats on the screen.
