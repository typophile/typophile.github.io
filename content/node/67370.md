  body: "Font Bureau sells \"Carter & Cone\" Miller. I believe FB has augmented the
    number of sizes/weights of Miller with the work of other designers, but what Carter
    drew up is available. According to Cherie Cone, Carter & Cone get the same amount
    of money whether they sell you the font, or FB does.I got my fonts from Matthew
    Carter only because I wanted some special characters.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nBoth
    Miller and Monticello are very good fonts, but you'll probably find more uses
    for Miller if you can only afford one family.\r\n\r\nFWIW"
