  body: Looks a lot like <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/alternate-gothic/"
    target="_blank">Alternate Gothic</a>, but the S is a little more "blocky" and
    the G isn't exactly the same either. Other than that it's a very close match,
    so maybe Alternate Gothic would be a viable substitute at least?

  body: I'm fairly certain it's Knockout, but a very nice substitute could be League
    Gothic at The League of Moveable Type. There are small differences but I think
    they're nice.

  body: Yeah, that's pretty damn close. The S seems to have a little less air in Knockout,
    could just be a lighter weight though?

  body: No matter what it's going to be one of the Bantamweights.. I was just showing
    a quick comparison.. No. 47 may have been the actual match.

  body: I'm pretty sure it's 48. Possibly of a mix of 47 and 48. The first O looks
    like it might be a different pt size or something.
