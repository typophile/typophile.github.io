  moving working font files from one PC to another - both running XP SP3. She has
  even tried installing from clean copies with the same results, per below:\r\n\r\n-
  Open Type Fonts generate a 'file is missing or damaged' message\r\n- OTF fonts show
  up in /fonts/ folder, but are designated as TTF - trying to open these files also
  generates 'file is missing or damaged' message\r\n- The icon associations are all
  over the map:  .ttf files that call themselves 'True Type' have a true type icon,
  .otf files that call themselves Open Type (and don't work) have an open type icon;
  and .ttf files that say True Type but say they are an 'Open Type Font with True
  Type Outlines' when I open them also have an open type icon.  This may be normal,
  I don't know. \r\n\r\nIt is unclear to us whether this is a Problem with the font
  files or with Windows. Any advice/referrals much appreciated."

    the Windows APIs. If that fails, it's the files themselves that have been damaged
    in the transfer.\r\n\r\nIf not, your Windows installation might need a refresh
    ...\r\n\r\nThe icon oddities come from the fact that Windows looks at the file
    extension -- otf is OpenType, ttf is TrueType. <em>Then</em> it checks whether
    the file is digitally signed -- \"yes\" shows an OTF icon, \"nope\" shows a TTF
    icon. Go figure."

    can't be a transfer-problem as there were no transfer. It happened just by that,
    but i can't link it to anything i did/installed/deinstalled/blocked.\r\nI've got
    a InDesign-Document where i used a opentype font. One Day I opened it and my font
    was not available any more. first I thaught it was a licence problem, because
    i used an adobe-font. Then I realised that all my opentype-fonts did not appear
    in the pull-down menu.\r\nin the folder windows\\fonts the opentypes are all broken,
    some truetypes have opentype-icons instead, but work. I installed the adobe type
    manager, but it also tells me, that the fonts are broken. also new downloaded
    files from free opentype fonts from the internet does not work on this system,
    but do on my notebook.\r\nDoes anyone got an idea what happened?\r\n\r\nthank
    you in advance,\r\n\r\nboronian"

    concerning nVidia-graphics and ASUS Mainboards (see [[http://www.laptopvideo2go.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=18538|here]]
    and [[http://www.techsupportforum.com/microsoft-support/windows-xp-support/122491-can-not-install-otf-fonts-damaged.html|here]])
    for not wanting to be outdated (as the other blogs purpose) I first will try to
    update all my other drivers. If it works I will tell.\r\n"
