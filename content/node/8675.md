body: Hi Typophiles, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for suggestions for two different fonts.  <BR>1.
  Something like &#34;Clay &amp; Richmond.&#34; <BR>2. Something like &#34;ithographers&#34;
  and &#34;Chewing Tobacco.&#34; <BR> <BR>The fonts don&#39;t have to be an exact
  match, just something with the same flavor. Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/63070.jpg"
