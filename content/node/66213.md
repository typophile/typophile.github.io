    it right away for those that didn't \"get\" it?\r\n\r\nJust like blank pages that
    confusingly state \"This page intentionally left blank\" (a logical contradiction).\r\n\r\nAmericans.

    bottom of the page) \"The relative blankness of this page, except for this notice,
    is due to reasons of document formatting, and therefore should not be a cause
    for concern that any important information is missing from this document due to
    a printing error.\"\r\n\r\nAfter all, these were critical manuals for pieces of
    computer hardware costing millions of dollars, so it was reasonable to expect
    their customers to be a bit on the overcautious side.\r\n\r\nI presume IBM just
    thought that was too wordy, and the small logical flaw in referring to a page
    with \"This page is intentionally left blank\" on it <em>as</em> blank was worth
    its result in brevity, IBM being big enough to endure a little humor at its expense."
