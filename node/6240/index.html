<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Someone writes: <i>The barrier is not monetary. The barrier is that the org is fairly script-centric - there's pretty much no interest in it for other than Roman scripts and vice versa.</i> <br> <br>I think that ATypI is already less focused exclusively on the Latin script than it was when I first attended a conference in 1994. A long term change in the membership demographic would further diversify the focus of the association's interest. I would consider this a good thing. <br> <br>It is also worth noting that the Latin script is the sole or major major writing system of an incredibly large number of countries around the globe, so being Latin-centric does not necessarily mean being Euro-centric or Anglo-centric.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Before debating on the iniquities of South America further please read Hudson's post on Gross National Income. Note that Poland and the Czech Republic are a long way behind Argentina - are we seeing such problemswith Polish and Czech members whining about fees? <br> <br>Please also note the comparative wealth between Argentina and India - now whine some more about your situation? <br> <br>The figures point towards ATypI fees being something like half a days income in most Western European and North American states, and around two days income in Central Europe and South American states. <br> <br>This comparison is not worth arguing over, they eithr want to be members or they don't. <br> <br>A more problematic figure is the comparitive cost of attending the conference: a couple of weeks income in the better off places, versus a couple of months income in the less well off. <br> <br>There's no solution to this. But ATypI seems to have gone out of its way to put as much information as possible on the web in recent years, particularly in relation to the conference - this is superb access to those who cannot get to the conference itself (as I might add is this forum). <br> <br>In addition there is no reason at all why members anywhere in the world canot organise their own local events. <br> <br>While I'm here I might just note that there is comparitively low conference attendence and mmbership in Australia and New Zealand - again this is due to low local membership and the rigours of travelling - not the relative incomes.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>Note that Poland and the Czech Republic are a long way behind Argentina - are we seeing such problems with Polish and Czech members whining about fees?</i> <br> <br>Membership drops off sharply below GNI per capita of 19,000 (with the exception of Spain). Argentina, Poland and the Czech Republic are all in the same economic range in the spreadsheet I am building. We currently have four Argentinian members, four Polish members and two Czech members. <br> <br>Perhaps the reason that our Argentinian colleagues are being so vocal is that, while the Poles and Czechs are gradually seeing their economies improve and are to be welcomed into the European Union in two years, the Argentinian economy is still very unstable, may collapse further, and Argentinians might justifiably fear that the world is turning away from them.</div>

Yes you can set up your own local organisation, with local economics in mind, and be somehow affiliated with ATypI. <br> <br>Hudson also wrote: <br>I think that ATypI is already less focused exclusively on the Latin script than it was when I <br>first attended a conference in 1994. <br> <br>------ <br> <br>I think most typophiles have a general interest in other script systems, you probably moreso than many. But the fact is that those more interested in Indic, Arabic or CJK for example are not really going to be that interested in ATypI as an org because there are other setups that reprsent their needs more accurately. <br> <br>If ATypI were to try to organise a conference in Tokyo it would fail miserably - you know this as well as I. <br> <br>As my previous post, look to Australia and New Zealand for some comparison too.</div>

For now I'm simply a "Provisional Member" regardless of any success or future certificates. 7 years total. <br> <br>The only creative and perhaps complex part of my suggestion is determining the fee/score ratio.

<div class=commentbody>&lt;i>I think this ignores the basic fact that it costs as much, if not more, to "service" these discounted memberships as it does any other membership.&lt;i> <br> <br>I've been very careful to take this into account while thinking about this. I mentioned earlier that ATypI needs to find more efficient solutions, and this includes more efficient membership management and service. The association needs to do this anyway, regardless of whether fees are adjusted, because we need to free up resources for other things. <br> <br>There is also an economy of scale at work here: servicing two members does not cost double what it costs to service one. I suspect we are probably already near the point at which, for example, doubling the number of members to be serviced would not have a significant impact on resources, presuming an efficient management system. If you can service 500 members, you can probably service a thousand at not much more cost. <br> <br>I disagree with your assessment. I think there are grounds for discounted membership <i>and</i> a practical model for implementing it without risking a decrease in overall revenues. Of course there are further issues to consider, but these should be looked at by the ATypI board. I'm encouraged by the figures I have run, and think the possibility is worth the board's attention. I certainly don't think it is the place of an anonymous poster to a discussion forum to tell anyone 'no you can't have discounted membership'.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tanya writes: <i>If the only pass to membership in ATypI is a cheque for base fees, then its not much more valuable then my Blockbuster card...</i> <br> <br>ATypI membership used to require recommendation of existing members, review, etc., because the association was basically a private club for type manufacturers and type designers. Over the past decade, ability to pay has indeed become pretty much the sole criterion for membership. Remarkably, this has not generally lowered the prestige of the association, such as it is: the quality of membership remains high. The risk of devaluation of membership is there, but it hasn't hit in any significant way. Indeed, I think the increased diversity of membership has been very positive, offsetting the risk. <br> <br>The GDC is a professional association in much the same way that doctors and lawyers have such associations. It provides an organisation framework for defining ethical business practices, pricing norms, etc. There are very tangible benefits to membership and also tangible benefits to clients in knowing that the designers they hire belong to such an association. ATypI doesn't really function this way: it is a social and business association in which type designers, type vendors and font technology meet to exchange information, discuss common concerns, and celebrate a common love of typography. The latter aspect also attracts graphic designers, printers and other people with an interest in type. That is a very different constitution than a professional association like the GDC, in which all the members are basically involved in the same kind of work. One of the peculiarities of ATypI is that most of my clients are also members, which would certainly not be true of most professional associations.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hudson: <br>> Er, no, I'm living on the ATypI board... <br> <br>Is that uncomfortable for them? <br> <br>In all seriousness, you just proposed that doubling the membership would not result in a doubling of the costs associated with servicing that membership. <br> <br>I say you're living in la-la land because you've no hope whatsoever of getting even remotely close to doubling the membership. <br> <br>Board member and ATypI organiser/volunteer or not. <br> <br>As to who I am, I don't see that it matters. Either my argument carries weight or it does not. Your's carries no more wieght because you are John Hudson, ATypI board member. <br> <br>On the other hand, knowing a Hrant's a Hrant, and having his AK47 close to hand (quite possibly in his hand), does help one discount his posts immediately.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have to agree with John here. If you're going to go after people, be sincere about it and identify yourself. It's like you're afraid of something. I don't get it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Matha, you're not understanding what I'm writing. Not my problem. Worse things than AK's? Yep, idiots who boast of carrying them. <br> <br>John, not afraid of anything, not here anyway. I could write a name, but would it mean anything unless you knew that name? If you knew the name that would just reinforce any prejudice you may have. <br> <br>So I write as "this form is busted" (please do something about it?) - so no prejudice either way. Take from that what you like. <br> <br>Hudson wants to show his credentials and his board membership, but he does not speak for the board here so why should it matter?</div>

<div class=commentbody>You're not understanding me either, a chara. AKs are old hat. You're showing your age, or you're watching too much TV. In any case, you're talking through your arse, as John rightly pointed out. <br> <br>And as to writing your name, go for it, I dare you.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Matha: What is happening on a local level in ATypI? <br> <br>Nothing - no one seems to volunteer and not many of the country delegates appear able to take the initiative themselves <br> <br>Oh, and to answer the question - no, ATypI is not elitist. As previously discussed the fees are actually pretty low and there is no test to pass to gain membership - which is not the case with other such organisations.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> no one seems to volunteer... <br> <br>If there's no local structure, this would be difficult. Something to fix, maybe. <br> <br>> and not many of the country delegates appear able to take the initiative themselves <br> <br>Do you have an example or two of country delegates who do take the initiative? Might give us a few ideas. <br> <br>I don't think ATypI is elitist but like any other longstanding institution it doesn't hurt to introspect a bit. <br> <br>Any chance of a first name?
