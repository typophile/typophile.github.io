    Are there any other letters that can help prove it is a font? These three letters
    are not much to use for ID purposes.\r\n\r\n- Mike yanega"

  body: "In looking for this I found a similar font that might be the answer: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/symbol/?refby=bowfin|ITC
    Symbol Black Italic]]. At least it seemed close to my eyes. Your sample looks
    like a tiny serif style, and that was how I searched for it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
