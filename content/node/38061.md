  become fascinated with the odd fonts you see on Chinese packaging, particularly
  in herbal medicine shops. Some of the designs use stock western fonts, but there
  are fonts I've never seen anywhere else, and some have a delightful slightly off-kilter
  spidery look that probably comes from being designed by someone whose natural idiom
  is not the Roman alphabet.\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen any articles about these fonts,
  or websites or listings? "

    made in Eastern Asian countries, I wanted to mention [[http://www.engrish.com|Engrish.com]].

  body: "[[http://www.typodermic.com/10.html|Chinese Rocks]] was based on hand cut
    lettering from Chinese wholesale containers. From the looks of the original lettering
    I'd say it was made using hand-cut rubber - similar to the rubber in a rubber
    stamp. I think they used a tampo machine but only Chinese factory workers know
    for sure.\r\n\r\nI've seen the same lettering recently on a box of machine dies
    (make your own bolts, threaded rods etc.) in an antique shop. Check out the numeral
    2 - I've seen a similar style of 2 stamped on Chinese bike wheel rims.\r\n\r\nAnother
    common feature of Chinese roman lettering is chopping or raising letters with
    descenders. Descender chopping isn't restricted to China as anyone who's played
    Japanese RPG games can attest."
