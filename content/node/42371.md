  offers in advanced/post graduate education for Type Design. I am aware of the programs
  at Reading University in England and the one at Royal Academie in Holland. Are there
  other of such quality? If so, which ones? ... Apart from listing other schools,
  what are the main differences in between those two programs?\r\n\r\nThanks for any
  feedback,\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGiovanni"

    an American like myself, I''m limited to the two English-speaking programs, which
    are the ones you mentioned above. There''s also a certificate in type design you
    can get from SCAD (Savannah College of Art & Design), but from just my brief scanning
    of the program it doesn''t look like it compares at all to Reading or KABK. Why
    isn''t there a good American, or at least North American, type design program
    that rivals those in Europe? Does anyone think this could be a possibility in
    the future? '

  body: "Very few people have attended both programs, so I would take any comparisons
    of them with a grain of salt. I graduated from the Reading program in 2006 and
    I can speak to some of the benefits of their approach:\r\n- the opportunity, through
    first-class lectures and the proximity of research resources, to really solidify
    your understanding of the historical legacy underpinning the art\r\n- rigorous
    standards requiring that you design a family of typefaces, and that they be readable
    in text settings (harder than designing a display face)\r\n- exposure to diverse
    design approaches through guest lecturers (no dogma)\r\n- a requirement that you
    write a research dissertation. (If you are not interested in research and writing,
    this may not be for you, but have you noticed that those who contribute most to
    the community dialog have a background in research as well as design?)\r\n- some
    great field trips\r\n- and, as was mentioned, an opportunity to learn from experts
    in nonlatin typefaces.\r\n\r\nThings you might want to consider:\r\n- this is
    a program for self-learners. The absence of dogma means nothing is simply handed
    to you. You have to figure out for yourself the right approach.\r\n- this is a
    very intense program for most people to accomplish in 12 months. You work all
    the time. Your social life will be on hold, except of course with your fellow
    students.\r\n- Reading graduates are very successful in finding jobs in the industry
    and are well represented in the awards competitions \r\n\r\nHope this helps, even
    though it only speaks to half your question.\r\n\r\nJuliet"
