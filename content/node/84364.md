  we call the \"book\" \"a\" in first grade language.  What type of font should I
  look for?  I've been looking at sans serif fonts which typically have the \"open\"
  \"a\" format I'm looking for.  If you know the name of the style I'm looking for,
  and/or a font that you would suggest, please share, and thank you in advance!\r\n\r\nI
  love fonts and I'm so happy this website exists. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nMelissa"

    schoolbook isn't really a satisfactory description since many want a single-storey
    /a/ for other reasons including something as fickle as fashion.\r\n\r\nHave a

  body: "Are you looking for a model for reading or for writing?\r\n\r\nWhile the
    descriptive distinction is usually single-storey vs. double-storey, what we're
    really talking about is a distinction between the basic shaping of a number of
    letters \u2014 a, g and, less prominently, y \u2014 in formal (bookhand) and informal
    (cursive) Italian humanist writing on which the modern forms of our alphabet are
    based. The bookhand provides the model of typographic text that we read most,
    and the cursive provides the model for most handwriting, even unconnected 'print'
    letters.\r\n\r\nI recall some studies done in the UK some years ago that found
    there was no benefit to using the single-storey a in teaching children to <em>read,</em>
    and that kids had little difficulty learning to recognising the typical typographic
    a, or understanding that this represents the same letter as the other form. Conversely,
    teaching kids to read using only a single-storey form that is going to be much
    less common in everything they read in the rest of their lives seems perverse.\r\n\r\nI
    presume the reason the single-storey form has been favoured in primary reading
    education is that it corresponds to the form that the kids will learn to <em>write.</em>
    But I'm not convinced that learning to read and learning to write are closely
    related activities, even though their matter involves the same set of signs."
