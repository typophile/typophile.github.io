  designers out there who have opinions on the copyright law surrounding typefaces.
  The following are some questions I thought might propel the discussion:\r\n\r\nFirstly,
  as you see it, do you feel well protected by the copyright law concerning typeface
  design?\r\n\r\nWhat do you see as the main flaws of the way the law works to protect
  you as a designer?\r\n\r\nDo you feel the main problem to be piracy or plagiarism?\r\n\r\nWhy
  do you feel so many people are willing to appropriate typefaces without the artist/designer's
  permission?\r\n\r\nHow do you feel would be the best way to resolve this ongoing
  problem? Does it come from a change in legislation, or an attempt to change people's
  attitudes...?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time guys and gals."

    in first place ; to prevent, it's perhaps necessary but it could not be sufficient\r\n\r\n@jmontalbano:
    yeah, sometime the best way to win is not to play, i make typefaces myself (www.vtf.fadebiaye.com)
    but i do not expect this hobby to be a way to earn money. i'm not sure it's actually
    a good thing to live exclusively out type design, i mean not as such but from
    an intellectual point of view. my typefaces are piracy-proff, there is no kerning,
    limited charset ; you cannot steal what donot exist..."

  body: "Protecting digital fonts doesn't seem to be a tough chore, and the laws seem
    to exist to do so.\r\n\r\nProtecting typeface designs through copyright though
    would seem to me to be very difficult due to the subjective nature of it, but
    could be done as they've done it with music. It never the less would be very,
    very subjective. With music, digital sampling was a new wrinkle for the courts
    and I guess it would be with typeface design too. Which of the many Garamond designs
    is an original work and which are too derivative? How far is too far with derivation?
    Where is the line to not cross?\r\n\r\nThere would be some interesting cases if
    typeface copyright law in the U.S. is tightened up. Here's an interesting and
    classic case of the subjective nature of musical copyright law being enforced:\r\n\r\nGeorge
    Harrison vs Bright Tunes Music Corp.\r\n[[http://www.fairwagelawyers.com/most-famous-music-copyright-infringment.html|http://www.fairwagelawyers.com/most-famous-music-copyright-infringment.html]]"

  body: "I'm not interested in these issues.\r\nHinting and screen resolution also
    leave me cold.\r\nOf course, I must take these into account for business reasons,
    but generally I follow the norm, without any opinion as to whether that is good
    or bad or in my best interests.\r\nI have held strong opinions about such aspects
    of the type business in the past, and have spoken out, but it seemed pretty pointless,
    as the voice of one small foundry doesn't carry much weight, and there is little
    solidarity amongst foundries.\r\n\r\nI don't think piracy and plagiarism, as far
    as they exist, have much affect on the digital type industry.\r\nThere has always
    been font piracy, plagiarism, free fonts, bundled fonts, &c, and there is a perception
    held by some (generally not in the font business) that this is bad and a serious
    issue and it's hard to make a living selling fonts. But the digital type industry
    is thriving despite these putative impediments, which have been around since day
    one. Fonts are not music."

    an art or science? I agree fonts are not music, but do think drawing typefaces
    is an art similar to writing music, and that like the George Harrison case it's
    a fine line that separates inspiration from appropriation. The difference is that
    with drawing typefaces there is no law against appropriation, where in music there
    is."
