body: "I am trying to get the opentype features sups, sinf, numr and dnom (superscript,
  etc.) to work.\r\n\r\nThe glyphs 0-9 look exactly the same, so my idea was to use
  a sub- and a pos-command:\r\n- first substitute the original big numerals with smaller
  variants\r\n- then reposition them vertically, depending on whether they are superscripts,
  inferiors, numerators or demoninators\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Adobes Garamond Pro is using
  4 instances of the small variants, each of them identical, but with a different
  position, and doing everything via substitution. Is this the \"official\" way to
  implement the features? What is the advantage?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\nsebilar"

    \ ;-)\r\n\r\nThere is no \"correct\" way. It depends. \r\nIf you would like to
    kern \"sups\" or \"numr\" or \"sinf\" numerals with preceding glyphs, it would
    be better to use 4 instances of the smaller numerals together with sustitution
    commands. (Kerning values for superiors are not necessarily good for inferiors
    too.)\r\nIf you don't intend to kern them, you may use sub+pos. This helps keep
    the character set a bit smaller. However, pos and sub in the same feature can
    be implemented only with VOLT so far, not with ADFDK and thus not FontLab Studio.\r\n\r\nProvided
    that this is the way MS and Adobe want to go in future, then it may be wise also
    to include a \"subs\" feature with the same sub/pos  commands as \"sinf\". \r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "The benefit of using separate glyphs for each feature, rather than one set
    of glyphs and a GPOS vertical position adjustment, is that in the latter case
    you cannot reliably kern to adjacent glyphs. Consider, if you have an uppercase
    T followed by a subscript 3, for whatever reason. You probably want to slightly
    kern that subscript number closer to the T, but if you then use the same glyph
    in a superscript position the same kern data will cause it to collide with the
    top bar of the T. Since kerning is simply a horiztonal relationship between two
    glyph IDs without any knowledge of their relative vertical alignment, there is
    no way around this via the kern feature.\r\n\r\nNow, it may be possible to include
    pair adjustment GPOS lookups within the specific script style feature. So, for
    instance, you might have a lookup that kerns the script style 3 to the T <em>in
    the subs feature.</em> In theory, this would work. But it is simpler, and also
    faster in terms of processing, to add the extra glyphs and do it the way Adobe
    and others have. Glyph space in fonts is pretty cheap, especially if you use composites
    or subroutinisation, whereas every additional lookup in a font slows down processing
    and layout, and GPOS lookups are slower than GSUB."

    so far\r\n\r\nIt seems to work... somehow.\r\nFontlab 5 turns crazy when compiling
    the feature with pos and sub (it shows the feature twice in the OT-preview-Menu
    and only works if both are activated).\r\nWhen exporting (Opentype PS), the feature
    works fine in InDesign CS2 (I haven't tested anything else yet).\r\n\r\nBut John
    Hudson is right: Kerning is easier the other way round. I was just hoping to reduce
    glyph-count.\r\n\r\nSo for now: march back... after some break, as I start to
    hate figures already: Somehow, the whole oldstyle/lining-, tabular/proportional-features
    are still frustrating and confusing to me. Is there no guide I haven't found yet
    that describes how to do them? They work in Fontlab, but do not in ID CS2 (only
    confusing results).\r\n\r\nThanks for the help (and the link)\r\nSebilar"

  body: ok, I think a complete re-write of the figures-features and understanding
    how indesign combines osf/lining and proportion/tabular did solve all problems.
    It works now :)
