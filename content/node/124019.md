    original Pixie was marketed by Filmotype, but it doesn\u2019t appear to have been
    digitized yet."

  body: "A promo blurb for Elroy:\r\n\"The design of Elroy\u2122 was inspired by the
    character, Elroy, in the well-known, 1960s animated sitcom, The Jetsons. Elroy
    (the font) is as playful and mild-mannered as the character. A great font for
    headlines and children's books.\"\r\nhttps://www.youworkforthem.com/font/T4821/elroy\r\nDon"
