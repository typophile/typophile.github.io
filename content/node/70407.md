body: "When can I copy and sell an expired Typographer's or a current Foundry's type
  collection if it goes out of business?  I am actually being serious when I ask this
  with sarcasm infused. \r\n\r\nI have noticed that roughly in the last 10 years that
  with the evolution of the internet and software programs, that so many past font
  specimens have been converted into \"updated\" versions of typefaces.  I realize
  from previous threads and the comments provided that this takes skill and is really
  some sort of talent to pull off effectively.  That is nice.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, more
  to the point, does the quote \"Bad Artists Copy, Great Artists Steal\" strongly
  apply to this instance or do those who copy the fonts, consider this art?  Seriously,
  I would be fascinated to know.  I don't fully understand the logistics and protocol
  behind this, but I would like to be educated.  I am not questioning, I am trying
  to garner a more knowledgeable approach of how this works and what steps are taken
  to proceed in doing this.  It actually intrigued me to know this because it seems
  almost as if there are specimen hounds seeking and searching the corners of public
  domain foundry's and typographers for type to convert. \r\n\r\nFrom my interpretation,
  to copy a type specimen from a now defunct Foundry, such as Cincinnati Type, the
  specimen in question has to be public domain.  However, let's say I was the son
  of the original founder of Cincinnati Type, could I collect royalties after the
  fact now that the a public domain font from said defunct foundry has been created
  and is profiting from it?  Is it fine to profit from a converted public domain specimen.
  \ I am assuming it must be with how popular it is to do so.  This is just a question,
  I am not the son of anyone related to a public domain foundry now, but it would
  be good to know.\r\n\r\nMany of you have about 35-45 years left on the earth and
  time isn't going backward, I however, have much more time left to exist, and this
  made me ponder, when you all die can I then convert your fonts and improve them
  in whatever format that becomes available 50 years or less from now?  Actually,
  I'm not asking you if I can, I want you to know I will, but what I'd like to know
  is how long after your gone I have to wait.  I understand pdf specimens are ripped
  and extracted currently and that is illegal, what I want to know is when it becomes
  LEGAL to do this.\r\n\r\nWould your fonts be considered public domain once you expire
  or is there a grace period?  If there is a grace period, I will have to train my
  son or daughter in converting font specimens so they can start a foundry and profit
  from type collections.  Kidding, well sort of, actually not really, not if there's
  money and a profit involved and I have a head start.  \r\n\r\nNonetheless, at what
  point does something become public domain?  Is there a certain amount of time that
  has to pass?  Do your EULA's expire when you expire?  I am very keen and serious
  to know how this would play out.  It would be enticing to know if it would be legal
  to convert a typographers/foundry's work once they are deceased or the foundry has
  gone out of business.  Is it odd to think there will be specimen hounds for your
  own work?  I'd like to get a head start 50 years in advance so that when the time
  comes, I will have done my research and I can be the first to convert the work that
  is available.\r\n\r\nI know, I know, most of you think you are going to live forever
  and this will never apply to your work, that is awesome.  Please know though, you
  are the ones whose work I will do first, their will probably be less obstacles and
  issues.\r\n\r\nI would imagine small designers, not a conglomerate like Linotype/Monotype
  would be much easier to digitally improve/convert their work to whatever new method
  is established in the future because of technicality and less hoops, but at what
  point could I then begin selling said designers type who is no longer around?  Like
  I said, I am being genuine in knowing and if any clarity is required, I would be
  more than excited and challenged to provide it.  What got me thinking about all
  this was how I so many graphic resources, antique as well as present and I realized
  I could do whatever I wanted to with the antique resources because they were under
  public domain, however much of the more recent work will eventually be public domain
  and I wanted to grasp a better understanding of when and how that line is drawn."

    name but also any rights around the designer's name - He's been dead for a while,
    but issuing a font \"Elvis Presley Hand\" may raise objections from his estate.
