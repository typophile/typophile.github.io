  5 year old is having a birthday soon and has been talking about starting a rock
  band called Black Eagle. I have no idea where he came up with this, but, being a
  dad, and a graphic designer, I obviously had to take the opportunity to make some
  T-shirts for him.\r\n\r\nThis is the logo I came up with.\r\n\r\nI was originally
  trying to come up with some funky blackletter, which I failed at, but accidentally
  ended up with this somewhat funky type solution. Thoughts? It's cheesy in a Spinal-Tap
  way, hopefully. Worth making it into a font?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blackeagle_3695.gif]"

    type gives me a native american feel.\r\n\r\nI don't see a possible lower case
    version, but that doesn't mean you can't expand to create an all caps display
    version.\r\n\r\nYou found an application for it, who's to say others wouldn't.\r\n\r\nPlus,
    afterwards you wouldn't be a wanna-be type designer, you will be a type designer.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I like that logo by the way."

  body: "Hmm...it does have a Native American feel. I suppose it's an eagle logo and
    the type does have a feathery feel to it. Another nice accident. ;O)\r\n\r\nGood
    points, asvetic. IT's not like this is a complex face so it won't be that much
    work to get it into font format. I'll give it a shot. Good excuse to crack open
    FontForge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I could definitely see some uses for this. I like that the 'E' is really lower
    case if you look at it, maybe you could mix that idea into the rest of the letters
    as well. Looking forward to seeing more of the alphabet when you complete it.

  body: "Lex:\r\n\r\nYes, that was my intention. I'd probably have 3 variants. One
    would be a 'hollow' version, and then the other two would be a solid version of
    the white area (outline) and then an overprint able version of the black area
    (the fill).\r\n\r\nOK, next challenge: Find some time to do this. ;o)"

    entire alphabet done in a month.
