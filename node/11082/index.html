		<div class="commentbody"> Well, imagination isn&#39;t generally considered the most important thing in newsface design &#40;even though to me innovation is an inherently desirable thing&#41;, but my problem with Poynter is that it&#39;s too humanist &#40;not that I adore Linotype&#39;s brutal Legibility Group fonts&#41;. Even Times I find too humanist, except that in its time/medium it came out OK &#40;just not any more&#41;. One font that&#39;s masterfully balanced is Olympian - there&#39;s a great article about it in this obscure Hungarian magazine from the 70s. On the other hand, Poynter is notable for its technical prowess - those four grades really are wonderful. BTW, it&#39;s interesting to compare it with the &#91;later&#93; Bureau by FB. Lastly: there&#39;s an issue of Critique magazine with a three-person review of Poynter - the one by Keedy is worth reading. <BR> <BR>I really like Unger&#39;s work, not least because it&#39;s more cutting-edge than anything else, and than it even lets on &#40;which can be seen as a critical necessity&#41;. The only problem I have with his news designs is that they simply look too cute at large sizes - but one could blame the user for that, especially if you believe that small and large sizes have inherent incompatibilities. <BR> <BR>In terms of headline news designs, my favorite has to be de Groot&#39;s Folha - his new Floris &#40;originally called Lucas&#41; is &#91;even&#93; more interesting, but I think not as appropriate to its environment: I feel French type needs to be &#34;sharper&#34;, like Meridien. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Poynter vs Bureau, in case anybody&#39;s interested: <BR> <BR>Below are a couple of GIFs I put together last year. They show superimpositions of the lightest and darkest grades for each of the two fonts. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/fb/poynter_1vs4.gif" TARGET="_top">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/fb/poynter_1vs4.gif</A> <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/fb/bureau_0vs4.gif" TARGET="_top">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/fb/bureau_0vs4.gif</A> <BR> <BR>The most notable difference is the alignment wrt the x-height. But there are also interesting differences of overal color, as well color gradation. <BR> <BR>As an aside, I would highly recommend the purchase of FontBureau&#39;s most recent type specimen book - it&#39;s a marvel. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
