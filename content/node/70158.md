  body: "That looks like Helvetica Neue, and it sounds like an all-too frequent occurring
    problem on Macs.\r\n\r\n(From hear-say:) The problem is caused by the Mac OS;
    the Helvetica Neue provided by the system is wonky, and causes problems when you
    are using it in a program such as InDesign. The solution is to install a new,
    \"real font\" Helvetica Neue.\r\n\r\nDo some googling -- it's been seen before."

  body: "I'd think the problem isn't just that the Helvetica Neue provided by the
    system is wonky, but you have a different version of the font than your colleagues.
    It's also possible you have multiple versions.\r\n\r\nIt would help if confirmed
    exactly which font is involved, and which program you're seeing the problems in.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    I deleted everything and reinstalled them and it's working perfectly now.\r\n\r\nI
    appreciate your help."
