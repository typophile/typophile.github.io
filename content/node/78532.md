  evening with your fellow Portland typophiles! Not all discussions have to be about
  fonts and typography, but it would be good if everyone was at least willing to have
  such discussions.  :)\r\n\r\nThis is our third Portland Type Tuesday, I think. We
  may soon be too many for this location, but they have a great Imperial Stout on
  tap, so we're back again at:\r\n\r\nMigration Brewing\r\n2828 NE Glisan St.\r\nPortland
  OR 97232\r\n\r\n7 pm Tuesday.\r\n\r\nI'll be the fellow with the green hat and red
  mad scientist glasses. Hope we see you there!\r\n\r\nT\r\n"
