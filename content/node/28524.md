  body: "I just came across this old thread while looking for a way to unpack magazine
    .exe files without actually having to double click it to open it.  Why do they
    (Bak) use .exe files for a magazine?  I mean I understand it may compact much
    easier but it kinda makes me nervous opening up something such as a magazine that
    is in .exe format.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut man on man this is a very nice digital magazine:)\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI

  body: I'd like to view it, but only as a PDF. I agree that .exe files are scary.
