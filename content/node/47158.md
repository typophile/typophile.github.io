body: "I am working on a logo project for a sports league, initially basketball but
  later will expand to softball. He wanted the logo to be more on the conservative/traditional
  feel versus a more current x-treme sports look.\r\n\r\nSo one of the directions
  I wanted to explore was using a classic baseball-inspired script. Yeah, I know I'm
  doing basketball, but don't get hung up on that.\r\n\r\nI've come up with Metroscript,
  Fenway Park (nice but no swash characters), Casey (too much contrast), LHF Ballpark,
  Philly Sports.\r\n\r\nMetroscript feels the most unique, but some letters feel to
  erratic. I like the swashes.\r\n\r\nI especially need an attractive \"y\" and \"g\".
  I can't reveal the full name of the client, but it includes the word \"League\"\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nDavid"
