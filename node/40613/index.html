Just wondering if anyone can help me identify this typeface, the closest typeface I can find is [Removed by Moderator]. I realise this sample is somewhat customised, but it in addition to the angled "A", it doesn't really have the same impact. Anyone got any ideas?

Tiffany, I've been in your position and know what it's like, I know how these things happen and how easy it is to make errors. But I have complete faith in you as a moderator (you already knew that) so take heart. It isn't easy operating in the red zone.

		<div class="commentbody">While I completely agree with the principle of not supporting 'derivative fonts' (a.k.a.clones), it seems there is a huge gray area here when it comes to revivals/digitizations of old typefaces. Many, if not most, of us do not have the experience, or type libraries, to know when something we see being used is original, let alone whether it is a revival, or a derivative. I suppose if we knew when they were originally designed we could guess, but in most cases that would be it -- just a guess. For example, the many fonts created by David Rakowski, Dieter Steffmann, or Dave Nalle of Scriptorium, that are taken from old specimen books. Often these guys changed the names, but as far as I know their digitizations were original. Even 'grayer' are the cases with the Brendel, Opti and FontBank collections, even though they are often the only sources we know of for digital versions of certain type families, or certain weights of familiar families (by other commercial names).  More than once legitimate foundries have issued 'new' fonts, based on old work that had already been digitized by 'amateurs'. That shouldn't make the amateur version 'derivative'. We all know many examples of legitimate foundries with virtually identical copies of popular styles, especially from the pre-digital era. Heck, it was standard practice for metal type foundries to offer their own versions of popular typefaces, just changing the name, and maybe one or two minor design details.

As IDers, often the best we can do is name whatever we know that looks like the sample that is posted for ID, regardless of its 'pedigree'. The fact is that the people who created many of those samples used the fonts without knowing (or caring) where they came from originally. I suspect almost all of us have bought 'bargain' font collections more than once, or got them bundled with other software, like Corel products. Not every sample we have to ID comes from a squeaky clean design agency that has nothing but licensed fonts in their font libraries.

I guess the bottom line of my almost-rant is that we just do our best. If the font we know is 'suspect' for some reason, then the moderators, or the folks who know more type history, can set us straight, as Tiffany did this time. I didn't intend this post as a criticism of Tiffany, because I think she did just right, but I wanted to make sure that IDers don't feel they need to apologize if they don't know the 'real' font name.

(A) I (we) don't want Typophile to become a place people can find links to such sites and 
(B) 9 times out of 10 even if the font in question really is the only one available chances are there are other fonts on those sites which are obvious derivatives, now loop back to reason (A).

I'm sure I come across as a dogmatic bore when it comes to this, but Typophile is not the place to find questionable fonts and I really hope it stays that way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, this seems like a principle that will limit us to foundry vendor sites. 

We have used links to sites as the way of 'proving' that the ID is valid by letting other people see and judge it for themselves. What are we supposed to do when the font in question isn't sold at an 'approved' site? We don't all have the fonts to be able to make a demo sample, and they don't all have test drives.

I would never call you 'a dogmatic bore', but I think this is a tough restriction, if it's enforced. There are a lot of useful free fonts out there, and designers often resort to them for budget reasons, and many are distributed at sites that MAY also have contraband fonts in their mix (not necessarily with the site owners knowledge). 

I think people already know about such sites, so it's up to us to educate them about the ethics of piracy and cloning, as well as the drop off in quality. Hopefully we can separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to these, but I hope we can do more than be a vendor referral service.

		<div class="commentbody">Mike,
you are addressing Tiffany, so I emphasize that I am not answering on Tiffany's behalf or even on behalf of Typophile. I only offer my own views on the issue you raise.

<em>We have used links to sites as the way of ’proving’ that the ID is valid by letting other people see and judge it for themselves. What are we supposed to do when the font in question isn’t sold at an ’approved’ site?</em>

Refer to an equivalent font sold by a legitimate vendor. There is no such thing as a Typophile "approved" site, vendor or otherwise.

<em>We don’t all have the fonts to be able to make a demo sample, and they don’t all have test drives.</em>

These are limitations you must learn to live with. Is that really such a big deal? Perhaps you're not making it out to be a big deal, but nonetheless an issue. Even so, live with it. Like that's hard or something?

<em>... I think this is a tough restriction, if it’s enforced.</em>

Nope. If you think that's a tough restriction you're just not realistic about this.

<em>There are a lot of useful free fonts out there, and designers often resort to them for budget reasons, and many are distributed at sites that MAY also have contraband fonts in their mix (not necessarily with the site owners knowledge).</em>

We are all better off avoiding such sites. Typophile's policy on this matter was recently addressed in the General Posting Guidelines, which I helped Paul Hunt rewrite: "...please do not post links to sites witch [sic] offer unauthorized downloads of commercial fonts."

That is Typophile's policy on the matter. End of story. If you find yourself at odds with that policy, I can appreciate why, but it's too bad. All things considered you really can't complain.

<em>As IDers, often the best we can do is name whatever we know that looks like the sample that is posted for ID, regardless of its ’pedigree’.</em>

We can do better than that. Refer to an equivalent font sold by a legitimate vendor.

<em>The fact is that the people who created many of those samples used the fonts without knowing (or caring) where they came from originally.</em>

If that is a fact you could offer proof to convince people. I think you're guessing there and making a broad assumption that ends up being sweeping in its implication.

<em>I suspect almost all of us have bought ’bargain’ font collections more than once, or got them bundled with other software, like Corel products.</em>

Nope, not I. Again, too big an assumption.


<em>Not every sample we have to ID comes from a squeaky clean design agency that has nothing but licensed fonts in their font libraries.</em>

True, but that's part of the challenge of the ID board---steering users towards greener pastures. The Kern is Green, dude.

<em>I guess the bottom line of my almost-rant is that we just do our best.</em>

Yup. Just play by the rules (established ethics and policy) and do your best. nobody is asking you to do more.

<em>I didn’t intend this post as a criticism of Tiffany, because I think she did just right, but I wanted to make sure that IDers don’t feel they need to apologize if they don’t know the ’real’ font name.</em>

If users and IDers feel they need to apologize for making an honest mistake that is entirely up to them. Nobody pressured EricK to apologize. He seemed happy enuff in the end and grateful for the advise given.

The bottom line---Trust everyone, but cut the cards.

Not hard to do.

		<div class="commentbody">James, 

I think the main part of what you said that I have some trouble with is the notion that every font can be found at 'a legitimate vendor' site. I also don't accept the idea that fonts are 'legitmate' only if they are sold at such a site. Amateur designers, and many pros have made fonts which they intended for free distribution -- Nick Curtis and Ray Larabie are two well-known examples -- and those fonts are used by many people, judging from ID's we have made over the years that I have participated here. To say 'The Kern is Green, dude' is a somewhat arrogant assumption (i.e that only commercial fonts are kerned, or that even if they are, that it was done well), and misses the point about what many people are looking for when they choose a font -- it's a design and a style they want. You can always adjust the kerning.

I agree that we want people to avoid pirated fonts, and I don't think any of us who are 'regulars' here ever knowingly have directed anyone to such fonts, but I think you are interpreting the Guidelines in the most restrictive way. I don't think we should need to filter through every font on a site to be sure nothing 'questionable' is in their mix. Of course if I know of a commercial version, I will point to it, but if I don't I will do the best I can to ID the font with what I can find. That's all we have ever done here. Has something changed?

		<div class="commentbody">Mike - Considering the incredible contributions you've made to this forum as well as to the type world in general with your Guides, I think that you took what came across to me as a verbal slapdown of a wayward child with truly admirable restraint.

I'm going to follow your lead and <em>not</em> make the angry post I'd been working up to. I did want to let you know, though, that I am in support of every word you've written in this thread thus far.

Actually, it sounds like we are still in compliance with the latest Guidelines to post links to DaFont and other freebie archives that keep themselves free of commercial fonts and clones of same - which is what we've been doing anyway.

Methinks we both suffer from that awful malady, Real World Syndrome.</div>

I realize most people will be able to work around that if they really want to visit the site but on the other hand some only do need the font and so having it download directly will help them and keep Typophile a little cleaner.

I should add that, no, I don't recommend Dafont unless there really are no other options. But that is the only site I do recommend when people are looking for freebies. However, to risk a little, Mike and Mike do you have good experience with TypeIndex.org? They seem clean, but I haven't browsed their pages in a long time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry I'm re-reading the last several posts and answering as thoughts hit me. 

I think as long as we continue to support the type industry by not posting to derivative fonts we are doing really well. It might also be useful to post alternatives in case they don't need an exact. I think you and Stephen (and Yves and others) do this already.

The experience I've had with many sites that supposedly only have legitimate free fonts is pretty bad. Most just don't understand. That is why I think we need to keep that to a minimum. But, on the other hand, I trust you to know if the font is or isn't really only free or if it is ONLY free. Like I said, if we can post directly to the download and avoid sending people to the site that would be the most ideal. Too severe?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your feedback Tiffany. I'm not sure I understand how to post directly to the download, but what I think I will be trying to do is make or copy sample images of such fonts. If I do the work I would like to let people see what I've found, to agree, or disagree that i have found a match (at at least something close). 

BTW, you'll be happy to note that I am now on a brand-new iMac, running OS 10.5 (Leopard), so all my past limitations and gripes about the site outstripping my computer should remain in the past. (assuming I can post these sample images with my new system)

		<div class="commentbody">@MikeY: <em>I think the main part of what you said that I have some trouble with is the notion that every font can be found at ’a legitimate vendor’ site.</em> 

That's not what I suggested. I only contend that legititmate vendor sites are the sources of preference in certain situations, specifically:<em>"What are we supposed to do when the font in question isn’t sold at an ’approved’ site?"</em>

My answer was "Refer to an equivalent font sold by a legitimate vendor." That is not the same thing as saying <em>"every font can be found at ’a legitimate vendor’ site."</em>

@MikeY: <em>I also don’t accept the idea that fonts are ’legitmate’ only if they are sold at such a site.</em>

Neither do I, but a legit vendor site like Myfonts is a good place to start. They also happen to distribute all of Larabie's free fonts, for example, as well as my free fonts and those by many other makers.

<em>To say ’The Kern is Green, dude’ is a somewhat arrogant assumption (i.e that only commercial fonts are kerned, or that even if they are, that it was done well), and misses the point about what many people are looking for when they choose a font — it’s a design and a style they want. You can always adjust the kerning.</em>

I didn't literally mean kerning. I was talking obliquely, making figurative use of speech. Nevermind.

<em>I don’t think we should need to filter through every font on a site to be sure nothing ’questionable’ is in their mix.</em>

Fair enuff. That kind of thing is a time waster.

@Tiffany: <em>Woah Woah. I didn’t feel like Mike was addressing me specifically.</em>

I did because he opened with this:<em>"Tiffany, this seems like a principle that will limit us to foundry vendor sites."</em> and in the middle was this bit: <em>I would never call you ’a dogmatic bore’, but...</em>

I thought it was obvious MikeY was addressing you Tiffany, and the only reason I responded (my second post) was because you made no response (for a while).

<em>...what came across to me as a verbal slapdown of a wayward child...</em>

It's easy to interpret my debating style as a verbal slapdown. I only make liberal use of selective quoting for the sake of precision. Any rhetoric or vitriol present in my response is to get my point across. I am also fairly candid, a quality some people interpret as bluntness.

@Tiffany: <em>Let’s just continue to agree that we’ve all been doing our best and continue to do so.</em>

I agree, and I did make that point too. Do the best you can and nobody is asking anyone to do any more.

		<div class="commentbody">What bothers me a great deal more is how a helpful guy like Mike Yanega can post the questions he did in his second post on January 9th, specifically addressing one of the moderators by name, and he has to wait two days until that moderator responds. Surprising that there are five other moderators and in the intervening time not one of them has anything about the matter.

Mike Yanega, I do have respect for you as an integral part of the font community. I make free fonts myself and have always supported font users on a budet by making free fonts that are useful practical designs, quite apart from being well kerned.

Part of the conflict here stems from you and I not knowing each other particularly well. So once again I offer my apologies.

I am also about to take that plunge. Sometime before my Adobe CS half-semester class starts at the local JC in March, I will be getting a spiffy new iMac. 

It will probably feel like my biggest upgrade ever, since one of the memory slots burned out on my 5 year old Dell laptop, and I feel almost like I have reverted back to the 486 days, as far as speed goes.

And I will be happy to donate this half-ton 21" Trinitron display to the Goodwill, or somesuch.

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany - I spent some time this afternoon checking out TypeIndex.org. While it sounds like the intent was great, in practice, the selection is poor, there's no way to browse, there are no categories and if you DO find what you're after, well ... I hit upon more dead links than valid.

Besides DaFont, the other freebie archive I feel OK with is 1001fonts.com. I've found no commercial or clone fonts there and, like DaFont, if a visitor does a Search for a commercial font, they are shown links to a commercial source.

Actually, I think that this commercial font referral system has been the reason that several large archives have purged themselves of commercial/clone downloads. I doubt it was coincidence that DaFont's owner cleaned up his site right around the time he began referring seekers of commercial fonts to Fonts.com, Linotype and MyFonts.</div>

Apology accepted. Thanks for coming back with those added clarifications. If we're not careful we'll find ourselves in violent agreement. Especially about "It's the spirit of the rules that count, not the letter."

I know it's hard to convey 'tone' in posts, and I think as we get to know each other better, what we do will say more than the words, so peace, I think that we've beat this horse enough. We've all had our say, and it was good.
