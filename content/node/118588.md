  help me again with this candy logo? I'd like to know in which font the word \"Coffee\"
  above the \"classic\" is written, and also the \"classic\", which reminds me of
  Mistral, although, to my untrained eyes, all calligraphic fonts look similar.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    of that Binner D font (modern, transitional...)?
