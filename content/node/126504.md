  on faxes. FCC rules state that type in disclaimers and opt-out notices must be \"clear
  and conspicuous.\" We are trying to define that. In this particular case the type
  was set in 8 pt Univers 45 (light), but it came through almost 10% smaller -- and
  blurry -- making it very difficult to read in the fax. Are there any published guidelines
  that state the smallest a typeface should\r\n be to come through clearly and conspicuously
  in a fax?\r\nThank you!"

  body: I didn't know that faxes are still in use! I don't think there're any guidelines
    for it regarding type sizes, I've never seen one. It may be mentioned in the original
    manual for a the device, maybe?

    Pool, who is also active here \u2013 on a DIN standard about readability. It\u2019s
    not a binding rule but official recommendations including minimal requirements
    for font sizes, stroke thickness, width, design etc. to make type readable in
    different circumstances. We distinguish between recommendations for signage, consultational
    texts (like what you are talking about, fine print, captions, footnotes etc) and
    body copy for longer reading. It\u2019s a German standard with the number DIN
    1450, not translated into English or taken over into ISO (as far as I know) but
    maybe this could provide a trustworthy argument in court?"

    with less pronounced serifs it might be a real nice font for terminals and programming\u2026"

    looked posted, either in the wrong place, or just to post something. Also, there

    if something looks good on a PC screen with both ClearType and smoothing off,
    it should look good on fax, right? (Crossing my fingers and praying that the screen\u2019s
    96 dpi is close enough to the 100 dpi of a coarse fax.)"
