  body: I'm pretty sure that was designed without using a typeface. The rebrand was
    done by Red Bee. Similar would be <a href="http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet/viewfonts">Chalet</a>

  body: "I know Jason Smith (Fontsmith) has done a lot of TV identity work for Red
    Bee, but his stuff is much better than this. This looks amateurish - no optical
    adjustment for the horizontals and lousy straight to curve transitions.\r\n\r\nI'd
    be surprised if JS had a hand in this."

  body: "Thanks guys,\r\nI'm a bit surprised you think it's so bad. Regarding their
    work and clients, don't you think Red Bee pays attention to transitions, adjusting
    horizontals etc? "

  body: It's not awful, but it's not that great either. Nick's right, there are bumps
    on the inside of the h and outside of the e where straights join curves. The arch
    of h needs thinning at the stem, and the tops of e are too fat, crossbars too.
