  anyone has any idea what font that is.\r\n\r\nI need to do a curved type treatment
  like that and the flat top and bottom and the rounded square 0 are taylor-made for
  that.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?  Please and thanks!"

  body: I like Brothers a lot more, but closer, perhaps, to the original image would
    be Larabie's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/kirsty/" target="_blank">Kirsty
