  this book cover from 1537. \r\n\r\nIf it helps, according to Wikipedia it was designed
  by Hans Holbein the Younger. \r\n\r\nHere's some info about the book cover: \r\n\r\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Design_for_a_metalwork_book_cover,_by_Hans_Holbein_the_Younger.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Design_for_a_metalwork_book_cover,_by_Hans_Holbein_the_Younger_3808.jpg]"
