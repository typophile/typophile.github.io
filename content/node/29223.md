    Who or What were John Baserville\u2019s Influence\u2019s\r\n\r\nIn terms of letterforms:
    his own calligraphy, and letters engraved in metal and stone. But his contribution
    was \"total\", in that paper and ink were central to his effort, and in this broader
    aspect it seems that his japanning* business (where he made all the money that
    he would later spend on typography) had a distinct \"ideological\" influence.\r\n\r\n*
    http://www.answers.com/japanning&r=67\r\n\r\nOne could also suspect that the Romain
    du Roi had an influence on him. But more interesting is to consider who was influenced
    by <cite>him</cite>, especially on the continent, where he was better esteemed
    than on his own island.\r\n\r\n> Any examples of Corparate Use\u2019s of his modernised
    fonts\r\n\r\nTons. Habitat* uses the Fry's version for its logo. Christopher Perfect's
    \"The Complete Typographer: A Manual For Designing With Type\" has good -if now
    somewhat dated- examples of usage.\r\n\r\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(retailer)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nHere's
    an image of his original character set, from Pardoe:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PardoeBask17_4245.gif]\r\nBut
    it's not an exceptionally good sample.\r\n(And you can see where Licko got her
    \"R\"...)\r\n-\r\nThe best samples are probably in Paul Bennett's \"Books and
    printing; a treasury for typophiles\". There's also a very good enlargement in
    an old article by Philip Gaskell in the APHA Journal. Unless of course you can
    get your hands on an original. :-)  BTW, somewhat easier in this respect is getting
    one's hands on a volume of Beaumarchais's printing of Voltaire's complete works
    using his original type (if not his original paper/ink technologies).\r\n-\r\nhhp\r\n"

    they're like a group of misfits in high school. The errant distribution of swashes
    in the original Baskerville italic seems to have been a result of a rush job;
    as in \"I spent seven years on the Roman, I'll be damned if I do that again!\"
    It's an example of a failure in moving from calligraphy to type. And every revival
    so far has either copied his bad decisions, or simply dumped all the swashes.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the ATF Baskerville (which is actually the Fry version, especially at sizes above
    12) had the best collection of alternates.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ATF_swash_4387.gif]\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    case. \"g\" must have spent a lot of time in the principal's office.\r\n\r\nIMO,
    JB was considering the contrast between the angularity of the italic caps and
    round lower case forms, and wanted to lessen the contrast between them, so introduced
    a few softer characters."

    to upper and lower case, in which kind of a setting the swashes are quite at ease.
    However, even in an all cap setting--properly letterspaced--as I said, they don't
    stand out too much. Just enough.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mean_5958.png]"
