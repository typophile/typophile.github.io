    *grin*\r\n\r\nMy son worked at a shop that did vehicle and shop signage for two
    years, and I don't he ever did 3D bevel text. I know he complained about some
    people asking for script, but often he could convince them to do otherwise, on
    the basis of legibility. "

    In what part of the country did you see these icky signs?"

  body: Because most of the people doing signage are not designers, but sign companies
    who don't know any better. Americans are about faster and cheaper, and not always
    better unfortunately.

    I'm not sure what's up with the different colors in the outlines, but the rest
    of the sign looks pretty nice.

  body: Hi Andrew. Looks like you took the link down, but I was browsing through your
    website earlier. I wouldn't mind seeing some of the images larger, like The Gateside
    Inn. I'm a sucker for gilded dimensional letters. You do some very nice work.

    that looks so good for attaining their shops or clubs.
