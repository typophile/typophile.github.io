body: Looking for a futuristic font, but not too futuristic, digital, but not too
  digital. Think Emigre&#39;s Base 9/12 and Cholla. Any suggestions? Thanks!

  body: 'Interesting request. &#39;Futuristic&#39; and &#39;digital&#39; seem to be
    other names for &#39;techno&#39;, which is not my favorite style, so when you
    said &#39;not too&#39; in front of those I was intrigued. I would recommend looking
    in two places: <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/specimens.html" target="_blank">Psy/Ops</a>,
    which has Reform, Reykjavik One &amp; Two, Transfer Sans &amp; Default Gothic.
    The other is <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/type/det/rs.asp" target="_blank">Device
    Fonts</a> &#40;Rian Hughes&#41;, with September, Gravel, Quagmire, Range &amp;
    Register. <BR> <BR>Of course there are many other foundries with techno styles,
    but these two foundries come to mind as having some of the less stereotypical
    &#39;futuristic&#39; looks, in my opinion. T-26, which also carries Device fonts,
    has one of the most varied Techno collections.'

    of the brief was a font with &#34;traces of FF Isonorm
