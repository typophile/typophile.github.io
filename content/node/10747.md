  I&#39;ve seen numerous books set in 11pt Electra that I would not want to read on
  account of the weakness of the type. . . . [T]his is something that can be judged
  soley with reference to the digital type as printed offset. Personally, if I intended

  <BR>I believe that Dwiggins and Griffith would have been striving to balance the
  performance of the type on both uncoated and coated papers; that is why they proofed
  everything on several different papers. The aim was to hit the weight and contrast
  so that the type was neither too dazzling on coated, nor too sluggish on uncoated.  <BR>

  body: If I were noodling with Electra to make it work better, i.e. making it look
    the way I would want it to look at particular sizes under particular print conditions,
    then I may indeed fiddle with the alignment, but I wouldn&#39;t do this simply
    because Dwiggins appears to have done it. If I were going as far as editing a
    font to make it more useful to me, I would make whatever alterations <i>I</i>
    thought beneficial. My point is that this approach is quite different from conducting
    a &#39;revival&#39;, which obliges one to refer to the original and to conduct
    oneself with some respect. What I&#39;m talking about is a kind of pragmatic sacrilege.

  body: Hi all <BR> <BR>Sorry I haven&#39;t replied to the latest. My connection went
    down early this afternoon and I just got back from three hours with Hrant. If
    you can imagine what that&#39;s like. <BR> <BR>Some answers to belated quiries.
    Yes overinking is the norm. I&#39;d say you could almost define fine printing
    as a noble attempt to prevent this. <BR> <BR>Fuzziness in letterpress is usually
    the result of paper dust accumulating on ink residue on the beard of the face.
    Constant wiping of the form will eliminate this but in long edition runs it will
    be more common. Tends to be more of a problem with photopolymer because of the
    shallow relief surface. <BR> <BR>I notice in the Linotype specimen book, yes,
    printed on calendered stock, that almost all the very small text sizes exhibit
    baseline shifting of certain characters. This is also a characteristic of Monotype.
    I&#39;d say this may be deliberate, for legibility, but I can&#39;t recall that
    I&#39;ve ever noticed it in foundry castings. It always looked wrong to me. When
    working with Monotype, in which the matrix position is adjusted by the operator,
    I always suspected incorrect alignment. I&#39;d say the same with Linotype but
    the specimen was produced by the firm so I doubt that it was a mechanical aberration.
    <BR> <BR>Tiffany, its an old saying. From an instructor. Never put words in the
    mouths of those from different times and different places was the explanation.
    I think that is good advice.

  body: Hrant <BR> <BR>I misunderstood your fuzziness question. Impression is a technique
    to facilitate correct inking. Given all the various factors that come into play
    during presswork there is only a variance of about a thousands of an inch that
    will provide you with a consistent pattern of inking based on impression. Too
    little impression and you will be consistently overinking to compensate. Too much
    impression and you are encouraging inkspread no matter what the pattern of inking.
    The feathering you are seeing is ink growing &#40;forced&#41; into the  paper
    fibers. Traditional oil-based letterpress inks dry by absorption, so there is
    a tendency for them to want to travel.  <BR> <BR>So, to answer Tiffancy, IMHO
    overinking and underinking is not a matter of taste, impression is a technical
    consideration. If you want to have clarity of letterform, inking and impression
    have to be coordinated. <BR> <BR>On difficult stock, many fine printers would
    deliberately print &#34;gray&#34; with a &#34;kiss&#34; impression just to preserve
    this. Since a lot of graphic designers today want the crunch and splat look, a
    lot of contemporary letterpress folk will accomodate them. In that regard, taste
    is everything. You wouldn&#39;t want to see dear Electra that way though.

    purpose, <BR>&#62;I can still ask: How far would you be willing to take this?
    Would you <BR>&#62;incorporate such &#34;misalignment&#34; into your own work?
    On what grounds, <BR>&#62;by what degree&#40;s&#41;, and with what techniques?</i>
    <BR> <BR>I have contemplated this very thing. An early version of Whitman had
    a fairly large overshoot on some characters and looking back at early proofs,
    I think there was a certain vitality that this may have lent to the line in text
    sizes and I am faintly sorry that I was so quick to regularize it out. At the
    least, I think it bears some more exploration and I will likely revisit the ideas
    in my next design. <BR> <BR>When I am able, I hope to ascertain whether or not
    Dwiggins deliberately designed these apparent inconsistencies in alignment into
    his types and to what extent. I have no concrete proof now, but it wouldn&#39;t
    surprise me if he did. I say this based on other elements that he and Griff consciously
    allowed to be inconsistent. In a letter from February 1931, regarding early proofs
    of Electra, Dwig wrote to Griff: &#34;There is a variety in the weights of stems
    and in serif details. I think this is not bad -- better than if they all measured
    exactly the same. Might it not be good to keep these varieties -- differences
    in serifs, in weight and shape of stems &#40;as between &#39;i r j&#39; for example;
    and the long stems of &#39;b d k h l&#39;&#41; rather than to adopt one particular
    stem or serif as standard and bring them all to that one?&#34; Following this,
    in his typescript dossier on the project, Griffith appends this annotation: &#34;[This
    is the essence of good design, little understood or slothfully disregarded by
    the best of designers. A notable example of the effect of such variety of detail
    on the movement of letters is to be seen in the cutting of Linotype Monticello.]&#34;
    <BR> <BR>From this I am lead to believe that in examining Dwiggins&#39;s types,
    idiosyncrasies and irregularities are not to be automatically discounted as imperfections
    of the mechanical processes. That is not to say that every slant and wiggle is
    intentional and should be slavishly followed, just that they must be considered
    carefully.  <BR> <BR>For one thing, a digital font, like it or not, will be used
    at any number of sizes. As a type gets larger these inconsistencies become more
    visible and no longer contribute the desired effect. In a note on the uncompleted
    project for a 24-point Electra, Dwiggins observed: &#34;The details of serif,
    etc., begin to be seen in 24 pt., and need to be more uniform than in 12.&#34;
    And also &#34;The slight concavity of the stems needs to be uniform throughout
    for the above reason.&#34; So even if inconsistencies were designed into the 12
    point master, it might in fact not be feasible to incorporate these into a contemporary
    font, given today&#39;s practices and aesthetics. I have no conclusions yet, just
    an interest in delving deeper into the matter. <BR> <BR>-- Kent.'

    Electra: what Dwiggins was desiging towards was not the patern drawings or the
    metal type itself, but the inked image of the type on paper. His pattern drawings
    were not the finished product; they were what would give him the letter forms
    he wanted when printed. This is something completely different than desiging a
    face that looks like it was printed via letterpress. <BR> <BR>Electra italic vs.
    cursive: the italic is interesting to see in mass, because its almost exactly
    like the roman in color. The cursive, because of all the rounder shapes, has a
    different effect. An single italic word in a sentence set in roman is nearly invisible;
    there is not enough contrast for it to stand out clearly, while the cursive contrasts
    well. <BR> <BR>Hrant: if you want to play with blurred letters, just put a fine
    gray stroke around them. Pretty much any page layout or drawing program will let

    <BR> <BR>Kent <BR> <BR>Since the digital face appears to be almost identical to
    a letterpress printed specimen presented in the way that the manufacturer intended,
    your stance does seem a bit odd. Most likely Electra may as well have met with
    consumer resistance when it was issued as a metal face for the very same reasons
    for which you are now rejecting the digital. It wasn&#39;t exactly the most popular
    face of its time period. Given only the minor discrepencies between the two specimens
    I furnished Hrant, I&#39;d say, that with a font-editing program, you could easily
    adjust the digital to that of the original. That would not solve the problem though.
    It would still be even more spindly. Since there was a bold version issued in
    metal as well as digital, I&#39;d also suggest that a meatier version &#40;demi-bold&#41;
    could possibly be put together using Fontographer&#39;s or FontLab ability to
    interpolate between two adjusted masters. Then you&#39;d have the color you prefer,
    without the outline disturbance of inkspread, as in the earlier specimens shown

    offering sizes during the photofilm years was abandoned was because the consumer
    resisted buying extra sizes when they could just as easily photographically enlarge
    the one size they did buy. The same resistance would be met with today with digital
    type. The onus is less here on the manufacturer than it is on the consumer. Monotype,

    <BR>Oh yeah. I recently gave a fellow printer two sets of Linotype Optima matrices
    in the 10 point roman. He told me that in the early 70s these would have cost
    around $2000 to $3000. Not sure how accurate that is but I wouldn&#39;t doubt
    it was somewhere in the ball park. I know that replacement character mats for
    Monotype were priced at $20 or $25 each in the mid 80s. When letterpress was commercially
    viable it was prohibitively expensive. <BR> <BR>Digital type is dirt cheap by
    comparison. '

    <BR> <BR>Possibly. I&#39;m trying to see past the nostalgia ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I
    do not long for the bumpy edges. I do not require squishy outlines or rounded
    serifs or anything like that. I recognize that there will be a range of stroke
    weight between any given samples, which is greatly influenced by vagaries of printing
    technique. I happen to think the stroke weight of the digital is a bit light,
    but that is not my foremost complaint.  <BR> <BR>My primary objections to the
    digital Electra are its excessive contrast and some of the changes in the character
    widths.  <BR> <BR><i>&#62;2&#41; The assumption that Dwiggins himself agreed with
    this or that &#34;rendering&#34; of Electra.</i> <BR> <BR>I agree. Which is why
    I try to be very careful to qualify my opinions and to provide as many primary
    source citations as possible -- to show how I arrive at my interpretations. But
    they are, of course, always just that -- my interpretations, colored no doubt
    by my own biases, despite my best efforts at objectivity. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;The
    other thing is that Dwiggins might have preferred lighter type had he lived in
    our time, like most people -if not you and me- seem to. </i> <BR> <BR>This may
    be true; tastes evolve and change over time. We can only speculate. Indeed, one
    of his later typefaces, Arcadia, was intended as a very light face -- &#34;round
    and crisp -- like the new moon one day out -- a trimming of Diana&#39;s toe-nail
    . . .&#34; If I&#39;m calculating WAD&#39;s dimensioning correctly, it would be
    about 60 em units in stem width at 12 point -- slightly lighter than Joanna. But
    it had less contrast than the digital Electra.  <BR> <BR>Returning to that. Dwiggins&#39;s
    own comments in the introduction of Electra include this statement: &#34;The face,
    as may be seen from this specimen, falls within the &#39;modern&#39; family of
    type styles, but it is drawn to avoid the extreme contrast between &#39;thick&#39;
    and &#39;thin&#39; elements that marks most &#39;modern&#39; faces.&#34; I&#39;m
    not sure this applies so well to the current version. <BR> <BR>It is an excess
    in this contrast -- the ratio of thicks and thins -- that I interpret Dwiggins
    to mean when he refers to &#34;dazzle&#34; in this assessment of an early proof
    of the 24-point Electra experiment: &#34;The 2/17/37 experimental l.c. seems to
    me to have a &#39;dazzle&#39; due to too much variety of color. . . . I have kept
    close to this stem weight, but have tried to iron out dazzle by getting the range
    of color more uniform as you can see from the thin-papers marked &#39;revised&#39;.&#34;
    [&#34;Thin papers&#34; refers to Dwiggins&#39;s working drawings.] <BR> <BR>A
    screen-resolution scan may not fully convey this, but the contrast ratio in the
    letters that WAD refers to is less than that in the digital Electra. <BR> <BR><img

    24-point proof was too dazzling, I imagine that he might have thought the 12-point
    digital to be even more so. I certainly do. [Full disclosure: my scan is taken
    from a photocopy of the original proof; I believe it fairly reflects the contrast
    of the proof, but I can&#39;t be certain.] <BR> <BR>[You know, I have to admit,
    though, that the digital looks a whole lot better when you scan it in and blow
    it up like this. Much nicer than when printed at text sizes on paper.] <BR> <BR><i>&#62;Since
    the digital face appears to be almost identical to a letterpress printed specimen
    presented in the way that the manufacturer intended, your stance does seem a bit
    odd. </i> <BR> <BR>Obviously, Gerald, I am not looking at what you are looking
    at, and you are not looking at what I am. And we are surely looking with different
    eyes. It is probably time for us to agree to disagree. I remain a little puzzled,
    however, -- and forgive me if I am misrepresenting you -- but your statement seems
    to imply that the way that the type was presented to the public by the manufacturer
    when it was first introduced was not the way the manufacturer intended, or that
    the way the type was presented in projects designed and printed under the direction
    of the type designer were somehow less accurate representations of the typeface
    than the showing in Big Red. I am not trying to denigrate the showing that you
    are referring to; I&#39;m just not convinced that it necessarily  lays a greater
    claim to the ideal representation than other examples.  <BR> <BR>BTW, when was
    the big red book published? <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

    <BR>I&#39;m not saying that at all. I haven&#39;t addressed the issues you mention
    &#40;the initial presentation, Dwiggins&#39; direction, etc&#41;. <BR> <BR>But
    you are comparing the digital to Dwiggins&#39; 24 point, which was never produced.
    I believe my point was that the specimens in Big Red were &#40;produced&#41;.
    And the digital is a near match for the 14 point. And the specimens are very clean.
    I think that&#39;s about it.  <BR> <BR>Dwiggins&#39; intentions are obviously
    of interest, and you&#39;ve brought that out very well, but the history of type
    design is full of intentions fouled up by the economics and production practices
    of the manufacturer. The digital face evolved not from these intentions, that&#39;s
    clear to both of us &#40;I think&#41;. My &#34;goal&#34; here was simply to find
    out where it did evolve from, for better or worse. '

    in the 1920s to early 1930s &#40;ATF, BB&amp;S, Linotype, Monotype, etc&#41; but
    did not necessarily carry date of publication, copyright or whatever. These were
    all published presumably before copyright became a significant issue and the Depression
