  body: "Unless it is a modified weight of the family, what you are most likely looking
    for is the Regular weight of Trade Gothic. Some older Postscript versions of the
    Regular weight use Medium as the weight specification for the Regular weight.
    The screen shots below show the differing name information in the Adobe Mac PS
    Type 1 and OpenType PS versions of Trade Gothic:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trade
