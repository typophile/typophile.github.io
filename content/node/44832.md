  access to it all. But don\u2019t we love the results. \r\n\r\nHere is a refined
  Century Italic to enjoy:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unknown_5109.png]\r\n\r\nI
  also like the slabs they have added to the romans. Hmm... moderns and slabs mixed
  together\u2014has this even been done before?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture1_6689.png]\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t
  get me started on the IKEA Futura too. Love that too.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "Beth I have seen that here too. The restroom is Men\u2019s only until you
    have a baby then your wife can come in too. \r\n\r\nAnd your right that IKEA messes
    up sometimes. I sent then a nastygram not that long ago regarding a sloppy negligence
    going on with their fluorescent bulb and battery recycling bins. The bins were
    so full they could not close. I also did not like the fact mercury laden broken
    bulbs were sitting a porous wood bin\u2014they should be lined and better maintained.
    \r\n\r\nBut at least IKEA recycles so that\u2019s a plus.\r\n\r\nBesides that,
    \ I LOVE there kitchen products and their new summer collection. This is the only
    place that I can get a good price on large (glazed) pots for the patio. Also,
    I love the dinnerware. I bought 25 of the 365+ dinner bowls there were on sale
    for .99 cents! \r\n\r\n\r\nNow Dennis why is it that you can take cool photos
    with a hulking camera and I, little \u2019o me, can\u2019t sniff the Persian kilims
    without a Chinese lady looking at me like I\u2019m a perv? I just happen to love
    the way jute and wool smell okay- sheesh :-)\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
