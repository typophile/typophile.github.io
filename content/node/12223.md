body: "<strong>[[Indices]]: [[Tools]]: [[Font Editors]] : FontForge</strong>\r\n\r\nFontForge
  is a free software font editing tool. It was originally named pfaedit, but renamed
  as its capabilities grew far beyond the ability to edit PostScript Type 1 fonts
  (pfa files). Currently, it has support for TrueType, PostScript (Types 1, 3 and
  0), OpenType, CFF, Type42 and SVG font formats. It also supports BDF, NFNT, FON,
  FNT, and TTF/OTF and PS Type3 bitmaps.\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nThe interface
  is loosely based on [[Fontographer]] 4, down to the menu organization, keystrokes,
  the organization of editing windows, and the tools and operations available. If
  you are familiar with Fontographer, you will have no problem learning FontForge.\r\n\r\nThe
  biggest detriment to the interface is that it uses its own homegrown widget set,
  which causes some display and interaction problems. The dependence on low level
  X11 code also causes portability problems, especially on Windows. Mac OS X users
  can use the X server included with OS X, but the UI experience will be far from
  that of a native Mac OS X application.\r\n\r\nFontForge contains both its own scripting
  language, described in the documentation as \"a mixture of C and shell commands\",
  and Python scripting. The \"native\" scripting language cannot edit glyph shapes,
  but is useful for conversions, re-encodings, etc. The python scripting support is
  quite new,  but has more powerful access to FontForge's features.\r\n\r\nNewer versions
  of FontForge also include the ability to edit glyph outlines as [[Spiro]] curves
  ([[Cornu spirals]]), as well as [[Bezier curves]].\r\n\r\nFontForge is an open-source
  project under active development. The author, George Williams, is very  accessible
  and responsive to comments and bug reports. \r\n\r\nWebsite: http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nDocumentation:
