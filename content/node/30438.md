  body: "<strong>Edit:</strong> I intially didn't have time to type all individual
    responses. But below are the proper responses I wanted to make. :)\r\n********
    \r\n\r\nTiff: Thanks for remembering! ;)\r\n\r\nChris: 21 HA! Yeah, I just bought
    my first beer! I bow before the Punmaster! But here's my attempt...Steve McQueen
    is certainly giving me a \"chili reception.\" (Might have to do some research
    on that one.) ;)\r\n\r\nDan: I apologize for the food that night. The beer is
    much better. If only they could find away to make that in sandwich form. Mmmmm...beer
    sandwich. I should also note that I have shaved my head and have about as much
    hair as Chris and Yves! But, um...I'm more like <em>Bald Extended</em>. :)\r\n\r\nYves:
    Actually...I enjoy having a birthday so close to New Year's. Christmas...then
    New Year's, then birthday! It's like a 3 week celebration!\r\n\r\nCarl: I'm gonna
    do it up nice next year I hope you can show up, even though I missed your Beorcana
    shindig. :( Thanks for the sample, BTW! :)\r\n\r\nNorbert: Sure, Norbert sure.
    :p You're still not off the hook yet for disappearing on us! :)\r\n\r\nSatya:
    Thank you for the very cool, creative greeting. \r\n\r\nRicardo: I'll be working
    on Bizzle-Chizzle again now that the celebrations and the visitin' with the relatives
    is over. I would like to see it released by this summer at the latest.\r\n\r\nThanks
    everyone!"
