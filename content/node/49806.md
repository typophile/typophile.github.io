  major issue. I used to. We have developed a graphical element that represents our
  company core. We are a communication and collaboration technology company and the
  logo should evoke communication between (two) sides. The next step is a typeface.\r\n\r\nAfter
  a few suggestions from our designer and several own attempts I realized the font
  plays a biiig role in the logo! I discovered the whole new world of typography.
  Beautiful.\r\n\r\nBeing (just) a CEO, I don't go too much into detail, but I think
  I am able to understand what it takes to create a good typo and yes, to use it properly.\r\n\r\nAfter
  quite a extensive research, we (designer and us, in the company) have made a shortlist
  of typefaces. These, in our opinion, work quite well with the slanted, dynamic graphical
  element.\r\n\r\nThe first two use FF Daxline (gradiented web version and a spot
  one). The third is an alternative with RR Lesmore Condensed. All in italic. Please
  see the attachments.\r\n\r\nDaxline is good, not so common as Dax, but inherited
  the good things. Lesmore gives a different flavor. To me, a traditional, elegant.\r\n\r\nMy
  question to you, esteemed typography pros, is whether Daxline is a clever choice
  and/or whether would you suggest any other fonts (and why).\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    about design. I don't get your mark. And \"Conferware\" sounds so \"Compuglobalhypermeganet\".
    It doesn't convey any sort of meaning to me other than a very abstract corporate
    environment. It reminds me of companies like the ones in the movie <em>Office
    Space</em>; Initech, Initrode, etc. In short, it's very web 2.0.\r\n\r\nThe mark
    itself is also very contrived and generic. Nothing about it would make me want
    to do business with your company. The two little dot square pilly things in the
    middle of the mark will get lost at scaled down sizes, and I don't really get
    what they're doing there.\r\n\r\nI think you need to be thinking about more than
    just the font right now. It won't save your logo (and your company) from getting
    lost in the sea of the corporate world. \r\n\r\npenn"

    our business. And you don't like it. But you have expressed your feelings which
    is good. What is good for us is that many other things determine why people do
    business with us.\r\n\r\nThis is a visual rebranding for us and I am happy to
    hear every kind of opinion. For now, we want to take the most from our existing
    name (which has it's history) and use a graphical element that represents our
    core. The typeface is a natural part of the visual concept, so I am seeking for
    advice how to connect these two in the best way."

    about the phrases (i.e. bs) used in IT world. It's full of these and I even don't
    like the consulting fabrications in general. If you would like, you can help us
    developing new branding (name, visuals), for this or another company. We would
    pay you for this, seriously. You can contact me through typophile message. I will
    be happy.

  body: Given the choice of those two fonts I prefer the Daxline. Penn&Ink is correct
    though, your mark itself needs some more work. The two dots between the swooshy
    things will be tiny specs when reduced to business card size. The swooshes are
    rather generic, in this design they actually remind me of a curly telephone cord.
    If you can go into greater detail about what your company does and who is your
    targeted audience we may be able to give better suggestions.

    of various hardware and software systems used for electronic communication and
    collaboration (with customers, partners, among work teams). All these products
    aim to make work more egronomic and efficient. The products are audio/video conferencing
    systems, office and contact center headsets, presentation tools, sofware for building
    knowledge bases (intranet and public enterprise forums, wikis, blogs for teams
    and communities). We don't develop these, we integrate and implement them in firms.
    We carefully select and carry products that are innovative and have real potential
    to make work more effective.

  body: "Considering the work that your company does, I think that your mark falls
    far short of expressing the human side of the equation.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm
    wrong, but perhaps the most challenging part of your business is convincing people
    who don't understand technology how the implementation of ergonomic technological
    solutions will make their life easier. Perhaps you also face the challenge of
    convincing tech gurus that ergonomics will have an positive impact on workflow
    and efficiency (i.e. they might think that your product is merely aesthetic and
    not of any inherent technological value).\r\n\r\nSo, putting these assumptions
    out there, how do you think your logo succeeds in convincing these groups of people
    that they should buy your product? I think for the technophobes, the logo will
    play as too arcane, and for the technophiles, it will play as generic. Not a small
    challenge you have in your branding attempts, if I say so myself. Let me know
    how on or off the mark I am with my thoughts.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "Nick, great insight. What you say is true; yes, the challenges you described
    are those from our daily business life. This reminds me, the philosophy of our
    company is to provide tools to make processes more efficient and life easier.
    These values are not instantly obvious.\r\n\r\nI'll tell you guys, we, the executive
    folks from business don't go too much into every aspect of corporate communication.
    We want the firm to function well. Sometimes we feel something is wrong and it
    deserves more attention. Like the logotype, typography etc. Then we try to find
    an expert to help us.\r\n\r\nThere are so many experts and everyone tells you
    a general story why a good logo is important, is saying she/he is the one that
    can understand your business... Some of them are lying obviously (one a little
    perceptive can see from their references). But some of them may be not lying.
    Maybe. Then it's really a tough job to choose the right one between those who
    have no idea about trends driving your industry or, for example in principle hate
    everything that just came around things like web 2.0 (but may be good in making
    logos and typography for traditional industries) and those who just tell you your
    logo must be flashy, glassy (and swooshy).\r\n\r\nWe want a modern logo. We want
    a logo that represents what we do. We want a logo that is not a parody of someone
    else. Every designer will tell us \"I can do it\". I had an idea in mind how the
    logo could be like, but I can not draw it. So I just explain to a designer and
    wait how she/he understands. The logo above is a result how one good designer,
    with good references understands. And I told to myself, not bad, a huge step forward
    from our previous one. Then another bunch of typography people tell me we are
    totally out. I'm sad.\r\n\r\nYou know what's interesting? If I'll show a logo
    from one designer praised by one (may be a large) group to another designer praised
    by another group, the second one often tell me \"that's a trash\". Well, perhaps
    not so expressive way. So, be a CEO for a while and choose the right designer
    for me, please."

    sort of process did you go through with them to come up with this logo?\r\n\r\nI
    would check if your country has a guild or association for professional graphic
    designers. They will usually have a contact list of their members.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    99designs etc.) and have chosen one with a portfolio that appealed to me. Provided
    a detailed description on what we do and what are the keywords. Personally I don't
    think a membership in any association is a guarantee of anyting when it comes
    to design kind of job. For me it's more like a lottery. I seek for references
    and just folow my guts (which may not always be what the company needs, though).\r\n\r\nAnd,
    for a small company, a freelancer is often a good solution. Also, the job is not
    limited to country. We don't have a budget to hire a total-solution agency like
    Wolff Olins."

    think all of us here just don't want to see you get short-changed with a logo
    that won't do what it should for your company. Like you acknowledged above, a
    logo (and therein the company's identity) plays a very important role in how well
    a company does. Without identity or branding a company can hold little hope for
    consumer trust and recognition. If you're interested, I've found this slide show
    to be a very helpful resource on the importance of branding: [[http://www.peachpit.com/content/images/0321348109/goodies/The_Brand_Gap.pdf|The
    Brand Gap]]\r\n\r\nI'm interested to see your old logo. Do  you have any images
    you could post? I'm interested to see if this really was as large a jump as you
    say from where you stood before.\r\n\r\nI also don't know how serious you are
    about perhaps revising or changing what you have now, but I'd be happy to talk
    with you more about it. You can contact me through my profile should you want

  body: Graphic Design is an art and art is subjective. People will react to a logo
    differently do to their background, education, culture and etc. Your last couple
    of postings seem as if you are getting quite frustrated by the process. Frustrations
    are frequently part of the process. If you believe that your new mark identifies
    your company in the way you want to be identified, so be it. I may be wrong but
    I get the impression that you are not 100% sold on the design either but being
    CEO you have other projects and you just want this one wrapped up. In searching
    for a designer I believe it is important to see the prospective artist's work
    in the actual medium that you want your pieces to be in. For example if your logo
    will be used on printed brochures and printed advertisements and business cards
    you should see samples in print, not just on an internet based portfolio web site.
    Art may be subjective, however there are certain universal truths when it come
    to production. If there is a small dot on a presentation-size design it will become
    a miniscule spec when reduced to business card size. Gradations my look cool on
    screen, but could cause some print complications. An experienced designer can
    steer you through all of this. Look at the logo, are you happy? were there any
    critiques that you think deserve addressing? Go back to your designer and talk.
    It's in their best interest to have a satisfied client.

  body: "Thank you guys for your comments.\r\n\r\nYes, I'm a bit frustrated because
    I'm trying to learn about design as much as possible. I want to understand what
    it takes to make a good logo and think I already consider a lot of aspects, I
    mean for an entrepreneur who does virtually everything in a company. But there
    are still a lot of things, when not taken into account, that may ruin the whole
    concept.\r\n\r\nBecause I understand we need a printable variant, I wanted a flat/spot
    version, too. What I didn't realize was how the logo would look like, when downscaled
    (for business card).\r\n\r\nI'm not sold on the design posted, but I liked it
    because it is not too shiny like the ones from today's web, yet the gradients
    look modern for me. The swooshes should represent a communication, interaction
    between (two) sides/participants and the two small things between them the actually
    exchanged information. All of our products are for (electronic) communication.
    Maybe they could remain but in bigger versions...? Would this work?\r\n\r\nEven
    though I have read many atricles on logo design trends and noticed that swooshes
    are overused, I had the feeling that these are not so obviously generic.\r\n\r\nBut
    still, my question is, if one designer thinks this is generic and another one
    it's not, how do I know where the truth is? Well, maybe throuh posting on forums
    like this...\r\n\r\nPaul: If you really do want an explanation, the creature is
    a head with a yellow border that are ideas, which are gathered and by a device
    (i.e. a headset) transferred into sound. Doesn't it look like this?"
