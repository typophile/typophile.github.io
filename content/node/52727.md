  body: It's not an exact match, but <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/versailles/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26seed%3D24%26dock%3D0%26size%3D71%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DREPORTS%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dsingle%252Cot.liga">Versailles</a>
    resembles some of the larger text. Some of the smaller text is similar to Century
    Old Style and various <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/scotch+modern/fonts/">"modern"</a>

  body: "Thanks guys! The caps in <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/briem-mono/compressed/\">Briem
    Mono Compressed</a> seem to match the slab serif pretty well. The lowercase is
    a bit on the nose though.\r\n\r\nPS: When did this new MyFonts happen? It's a
    total breath of fresh air!"
