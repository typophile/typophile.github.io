body: Does anyone know if the typeface used for the Palgrave Identity or the 'darling
  island' sample is a cutsom face or a commercially available font that I can purchase
  for a project?

    body: Hey thanks for the suggestion. Im after a face that has a more human quality
      as per the sample. Variable is a little too mono spaced for the job in question.

  body: "It looks custom, especially since the two fonts don't quite match.\r\nI think
    for palgrave they flipped the e over to make the a."

  body: "There are too many possibilities for similar 'techno' fonts for me to be
    convinced yet that this is a custom font. I can believe that it is customized,
    like flipping the a/e letters, or using an upper case i for the l ('el'). I don't
    think this is the font, but see how close <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/leger/regular/testdrive.html?s=paIgrave&p=48\"
    target=\"new\">Leger (T-26)</a> would be if you flipped the a and used the u.c.
    i for the l.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I meant customized, although it would have been extremely easy to create that
    logo from scratch. I wonder why they didn't match the two fonts up.

    target=\"new\">House Chalet Comprim\xE9</a>, especially the 1970 variant. The
    latter would only need a redesigned e to flip for the a, as Patty suggested.\r\n\r\n-
