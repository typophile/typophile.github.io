  page.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tracyporter.com/\r\n\r\nIn the image, just under the menu
  bars, at the top it says, \"Need a Catalog?\".\r\n\r\nIt is in some kind of script
  font. \r\n\r\nHere is the link to the actual image:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tracyporter.com/skin1/images/custom/2009-06-25-home-pageA_02.jpg\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?"
