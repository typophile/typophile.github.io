  post. I am trying to recreate the John Craven's Newsround logo from the 1970s era
  and I'm struggling with the typeface used. \r\n\r\nPlease see the attachment. I
  know that the words \"John Craven's\" are pretty much a version of Flash Bold but
  I am really foxed by the large rounded sans serif used for the main font: \"NEWSROUND\".
  \r\n\r\nThe closest I can match it to is Houschka Rounded Extra Bold (very similar
  W and O glyphs) but the R and the D don't match. Also, this font wasn't created
  until the 1990s so it can't have been used in the 1970s. Have I stumbled across
  something that was likely hand-drawn? It seems unlikely, as the backdrop for each
  episode of Newsround had the days of the week recreated in the same font (and/or
  font outline). \r\n\r\nAny ideas/pointers would be gratefully received. \r\n\r\nCheerio\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n"

    of Houschka as I also did the updated JCNR logo. That itself is not so recent.\r\n\r\n<a

    It's probably a messed-around-with Frankfurter."

  body: "Hi\r\n\r\nThanks, Nick! In the end I used a messed-around-with version of
    Houschka combined with elements of Frankfurter Inline. I spotted that the daily
    backdrops were the latter: \r\n\r\n [[http://sophieduffy.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/newsround.jpeg|Wednesday
    (note the standard Frankfurter Inline glyph for \"W\")]]\r\n\r\nI expect that
    the logo, being animated in a pre-computer era, was designed for a single on-screen
    purpose rather than to be easily reproduced elsewhere. \r\n\r\nCheerio\r\n\r\nSteve"
