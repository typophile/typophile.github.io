  body: "Good selection by Fivos as usual. For the record, this one is definitely
    based off Eurostile, the 'NIKE' part is blatantly it. The only things to do is
    to start with Eurostile Extended, even up /E crossbars and redraw /G cutting top
    right part and making terminal oblique. I guess it'd be pretty easy to do. So
    for your job, why not starting with it and customize it to make it unique. Eurostile
    is a catchy font and if you avoid or customize some of its earmarks (/S, /R leg...),
    it could work quite well.\r\nYou could also have a look simply searching for [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Eurostile|'Eurostile'

  body: Thanks, Fivos. My mistake as well. I think bokkah is rather seeking for Eurostile
    alternatives than identifying Nike Golf logo font.
