  body: "yeah the second is difficult to identify you are right.\r\nwhat about the
    first? the one that reads \"trunk archive\" it is close to FreightBig but its
    not. The Cap \"R\" is different.\r\n\r\nwhat do you think?"

  body: "About the second one, are you sure it's a font?\r\nIt looks to me like the
    designer took parts of the letter off from e.g. <strong>FreightBigBlack</strong>\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/garagefonts/freight-big-pro/black/glyphs.html\r\n"

    bit expanded and the lower right serif of R is cut off ;-)\r\n"
