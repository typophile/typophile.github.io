  open to any broader suggestions as well\u2014I'm looking for something that fits
  the young teenage girl demographic without having to give up some good design principles.
  Those two often seem to be at odds with each other, but if you know of anything
  that may help me collect some helpful inspiration I'd appreciate it. Thanks.  "

    reply was "something simple", which I take being basic sans.

  body: "Poor thing, I put her off of some font choices for a school project some
    years ago\u2026\r\n\r\nI just showed her some fonts, and Meta, Futura and Bauhaus
    got thumbs up, no to scripts, serifs or black letter. Avant Garde was so-so. My
    \"little\" girl is 14 years old.\r\n\r\nShe said she likes \"round\" letters\"."

  body: "thanks for the input. \r\nthe main font is a simple sans, but the accent
    type does need to be a script.\r\nWe'll probably will end up using custom hand-lettering,
    but am still trying to find the right person for the job. Jessica Hische is one
    designer that is really standing out. Or possibly someone like a Alejandro Paul.
