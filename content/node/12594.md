    is in the pagination systems, not the front end.\r\n\r\nAt least they have some
    kerning in newspapers now.\r\n\r\nThe trick is to design and kern news fonts so
    they don't need ligatures.\r\n\r\nI'd post a sample, but the upload feature on
    the Death Star is not fully operational yet."
