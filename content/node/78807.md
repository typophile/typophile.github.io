  contains many weights and both condensed and extended variations, etc. But if I
  open Illustrator or any font menu in any application, I see a mess of fonts because
  each weight of each variation has its OWN item...\r\n\r\nIs there some way that
  I can smoosh all of these fonts into one homogeneous family? Helvetica Neue, for
  example, is nicely organized. I select \"Helvetica Neue\" from the font menu, and
  then all of the weights and variations are in the \"weight\" menu. So nice.\r\n\r\nAny
  help with this would be hugely appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "In Font Book (and any Font Menu), they the fonts look like:\r\n\r\nFontName-BlackItalic\r\n-
    Regular\r\nFontName-BlackItalicAlt\r\n- Regular\r\nFontName-BlackItalicExp\r\n-
    Regular\r\nFontName-BoldItalic\r\n- Regular\r\n\r\nAnd so on.\r\n\r\nEach of those
    \"families\" has a single \"Regular\" weight inside it. What I'd rather is:\r\n\r\nFontName\r\n-
    BlackItalic\r\n- BlackItalicAlt\r\n- BlackItalicExp\r\n- BoldItalic"

  body: Forget Font Book; the question was, IN YOUR ORIGINAL FONT FILES, is the Family
    Name just that--the name of the family and nothing else--for all of the fonts?
    In FOG5, the "Typographic family name" should be the same, and Width, Weight and
    Slope should describe the other attributes. In FontLab, the "Family Name" should
    be the same, with Width, Weight and Style Name different in each version. I'm
    not sure where the proper slot for Exp or Alt might be; someone far wiser than
    I can probably help you there...

  body: Sounds like the family name is different for each weight. As Nick said, they
    should all have the same family name to make them all appear in one family. If
    you've licensed the fonts in theory you'll need to check the EULA before fiddling
    with settings.

  body: I don't have Fontographer and I don't have FontLab. I'm guessing that's the
    only way to consolidate all of these family names? I've got a trial of FontLab,
    and it's saying that each font's "Family" is different (in the info window).

  body: You can always uninstall all the extra weights you don't need. I think the
    foundries sometimes do this so the different fonts are available through MS Word
    where you can't get all the weight options.
