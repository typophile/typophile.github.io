  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello <BR> <BR>I have spent the last month reading up on the private press movement in England in the late 19th and early 20th century, and as I am sure most of you know, much of the type developed for these presses was based on Jenson's work.  <BR> <BR>I have been looking for books about Jenson and his work, but I can't find much. Anyone come across anything good? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jim</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you can find a copy, this book is worth getting: <i>Venetian Printing Nicolas Jenson and the Rise of the Roman Letterform</i> by M Lowery. It serves double-duty as a thoughtful history and a specimen of George Abram's Venetian type (George also contributed an essay). The text is in English and Danish. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, copies online appear to be selling for $250 or more. I found my copy by chance in a second-hand bookshop on Evanston, Illinois, for a <i>lot</i> less than that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There's quite a lot written in books on early printing and typography in general, and you're sure to find stuff in journals, e.g. <i>The Journal of the Printing Historical Association</i>. There just seem to be few books completely devoted to Jenson. I seem to recall seeing a biography at the St Bride Printing Library, but can't remember the details.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Please forgive this hijacking, but what do you think of Abram's types Mr. Hudson? I've read that his Garamond was superior to any other in his day, but when the digital version was released, I heard very little about it. Just interested. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like George's Augereau (Garamond) and Venetian types. They're both very clean, elegant book faces. His Augereau may have been a superior typeface to many other 'Garamonds', but I have trouble classifying it as a Garamond: there are too many features of the design that are radically different from anything that either Augereau or Garamond cut, e.g. this uppercase R: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/56311.gif" alt="Abram&#39;s Augereau R"> <BR> <BR>It is beautiful and a very accomplished piece of type design, but it isn't Garamond.</div>
