body: I've spent months trying to identify this font originally seen in a brochure
  for the MOMA in Queens. I'm the art director for Philadelphia Magazine and under
  the gun to try to find a new sans serif to update/tweak an incomplete redesign.
  I need your help and would appreciate any shots at it.

  body: "Glad to help a fellow magazine AD! The font in question is the bold weight
    of Office, from Lineto:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lineto.com/\r\n\r\nHappily enough, it
    has italics for the regular and bold weights -- a necessity in an editorial environment.
    Good luck with the redesign. Post some samples when it's done!"

  body: I can't quite place it - I'm not the resident geometric sans expert - but
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hamburger/baksheesh/">Baksheesh</a> comes
    close in style and quality, to my eyes. It's a newer design by Stuart Brown, who
    also did Neutraliser, one of the more famous square geo sans fonts. I would not
    be at all shocked to find out if this is a custom job by him.
