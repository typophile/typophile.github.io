  body: Actually, I&#39;m curious what pushed you to Aldus vs. Palatino . . . It seems
    Palatino is actually a little heavier and matches the specimen closer . . . <BR>
    <BR>Did you do a search for Rush fonts Karl? :D

  body: The lack of a serif on the crossbar of the &#39;E&#39; is indicitive of Aldus
    or <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/PALATINO01.GIF">the original Palatino</a>

  body: Stu- <BR> <BR>When I compared the sample to aldus and palatino, aldus looked
    like a better match &#40;albeit very subtly&#41;. I trusted my instinct though
    in fairness my instinct was indefensible. <BR> <BR>Is this for the upcoming Font
    Diner Rush Font Set?  <BR> <BR>I know you&#39;re a fan. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    card. <BR> <BR>Moving Houses? <BR> <BR>:D <BR> <BR>BTW, I should point out probably
    some of the best album lettering I recall from my youth was on many a rush LP
