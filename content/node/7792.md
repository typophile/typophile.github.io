  body: 'Mike, <BR>Thanks for the info. <BR> <BR>Daniel Weaver,  <BR>I trust you are
    trying to be funny or at least vent your angst towards the current NHL situation.  Perhaps
    you could at least spell &#34;losers&#34; correctly if you aren&#39;t going to
    positively contribute to the thread? <BR> <BR>FWIW, I contacted the jersey manufacturer
    citing the &#34;Latin Wide&#34; type in my correspondence and they responded that
    I had &#34;a good guess&#34; and that the actual Illustrator font name was &#34;Latin
    Wid D&#34;.  I did a couple searches for that particular font and came up with
    a few hits... but I&#39;m not sure how the URW Latin Wide D differs from the following:
    <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/latin/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/latin/</a>
    <BR> <BR>Any guess, or is this the same thing as the URW one? <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the super quick response, guys! <BR> <BR>Regs, <BR>Jeff'

  body: LOL.. nevermind, I&#39;m a total moron.  Looks like the URW version is THE
    version of the LatinWideD from further investigation.  What a goober I was.  Notice
    the &#34;urw&#34; right in the directory name of that link I included?  Duhhhhh.   <BR>
    <BR>Now returning to the rock under which I&#39;ve been storing my brain.  <IMG
