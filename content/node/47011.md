    might want to take a look at the whole decade from a historic point of view as
    this country changed exponentially from about 1963 on.\r\n\r\nyou might contact
    house industries, they purchased the photo lettering library which developed through
    the sixties then exploded in the 70s (i think) so they might know some interesting
    stuff."

    check out the Lettera series of books (more lettering, though). \r\n\r\nAnd a
    quick Google brought up these links:\r\nhttp://www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/MT1960_1970.aspx\r\nhttp://www.agdproject.com/whenindex.htm\r\n\r\n"
