body: "Since Adobe isn't doing custom work on fonts I'm looking for a type designer
  who is willing to customise my copy of Arno Pro SmText, Italic SmText and Semibold
  SmText (version 1.038).\r\n\r\nI want the single and double guillemets to look narrower
  and thus more unobtrusive, just like in most other text typefaces. See below for
  an example of Arno and Warnock -- the guillemets in Warnock look like I want them
  to look.\r\nI'm still a student, so my budget is limited. Could you recommend me
  a type designer?\r\n\r\nArno Pro:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/guillemets_arno_5290.png]\r\n\r\nWarnock:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/guillemets_warnock_5344.png]\r\n"

  body: If the Warnock guillemets are right, and this is just for one or a few documents,
    how about simply replacing Arno with Warnock for that character? That's be super
    cheap.

  body: "Yes, as forrest said, just swapping them out would be the cheapest. However,
    I'll point out that the weight is slightly different, and the terminal ending
    in the fonts (including the guillemets) is a little different. Swapping them out
    would work perfectly fine, though. It would definitely be best to do this directly
    to the font. If you can't afford (or figure out how to use) the software, I could
    easily do it for you, either for free or a very reasonable amount (it's only a
    few characters).\r\n\r\nEmail me if you're interested.\r\nartistenator <em>at</em>

    be just as well to do a search and replace.\r\n"

  body: "The EULA is hard to figure out. So too are the modification rules, esp. when
    a third party is involved.\r\n\r\nFrom:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/antipiracy/ff_faq.html\r\n\r\n<cite>You
    are allowed to use font manipulation software to modify the font software to produce
    \u201Cderivatives\u201D of fonts licensed from Adobe, as long as you use the derivatives
    in accordance with the same licensing terms that accompany the original fonts.
    For example, you can use Macromedia Fontographer or Pyrus FontLab to customize
    an Adobe Font for individual usage, but you are not permitted to distribute, sell,
    or give away, the derivative work, and the derivative work counts as one of the
    permitted number of uses.</cite>\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<cite>A consultant may solicit
    their services to companies who have legitimately licensed copies of Adobe font
    software. The work product of the consultant must remain with the company. The
    consultant cannot (i) take or keep a copy of the company\u2019s original, localized,
    or customized version of the font software, or (ii) distribute any original, localized
    or customized versions of the font software.</cite>\r\n\r\nI *think* all they're
    trying to do is to make sure that the number of extant copies are all paid for;
    that if a new copy is made, either it replaces an existing copy, or a new licence
    is purchased for that copy. But who knows?"

  body: If somebody wants to know how the customised version turned out, here is a
    [[http://sunedonath.de/misc/arnosd_test.pdf|sample text (PDF)]]. The font was
    customised by [[http://www.typematters.de|J. Weltin]] and I'm quite content with
    the result.
