  can we do about it? Reporting each single entry is probably not the best solution.
  I can't even ignore these spam posts because they always show up in the Track function
  and AFAIK I cannot even unsubscribe my own entries, can I?\r\nIf the admins don't
  spot these spammers, I guess the best option would be to give the blog users the
  option to delete replies in threads they have started. "

  body: "Sorry about the nuisances, Ralf. They're gone now.\r\n\r\nBoth Florian and
    I try to police most sections of the site daily.\r\n\r\nI check the General Forums
    and Design daily. Florian usually watches Type ID. And one of us usually catches
    Build activity before too long. I regularly check the main Blog section, but since
    the list doesn\u2019t re-order based on comments, only original posting date,
    I don\u2019t always catch spam comments in older blog posts. For some reason,
    certain threads become spam magnets.\r\n\r\nFor a while I was regularly checking
    the master Comments listing every morning, but I had to stop at one point because
    I was otherwise too busy and it\u2019s really time-consuming. I will try to resume.
    \r\n\r\nYou can always send me an e-mail if a spam comment persists and you think
    we\u2019ve missed it.\r\n\r\nInitial posts are run through the antispam filter,
    but individual comments currently are not. The engine still puts up too many false
    positives, which would seriously hamper conversations.\r\n\r\n(Ironically, this
    post was originally flagged and I had to rescue it from the spam queue. *sigh*)\r\n"

    know how to fool filters, would it be possible to set it up so that a new user's
    first post must be approved by an administrator before it's posted?"

  body: "James \u2014 Unfortunately, that would require too much overhead, since all
    this administration is volunteer. The Type ID forum alone would slow to a crawl
    and we\u2019d spend hours and hours every day monitoring and administering.\r\n\r\nIf
    everyone is willing to be a little patient and just ignore the occasional spam
    (irritating as it is), usually within 24 hours it gets cleaned up.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    I apologize for the occasional lapses when situations like Ralf\u2019s slip through
    undetected for an extended length of time. For those cases, just let one of us
    know."

  body: "> we\u2019d spend hours and hours every day monitoring\r\n\r\nI understand
    that if you have to manually search for posts by new users, but is there a way
    to configure the software so it presents you with just a list of first-time posts
    from new users? (After the spam filter has already done an initial weeding.)\r\n\r\nI'm
    asking because a friend used to moderate a discussion board and it was configured
    that way. A couple of times a day she'd just review the list of first-time posts
    from new users that had made it through the spam filter, and it just took her
    a minute to weed out the remaining spam and approve the rest. \r\n\r\nPerhaps
    the software running this message board doesn't have that feature; I'm just asking.
    I totally understand that manually searching would be too time-consuming.\r\n"
