  comes from the over usage of the typeface by industrial designers and Hollywood
  blockbusters. http://iloveeurostile.com\r\n\r\nWhat's your take? Are you sick of
  seeing Eurostile? Do you think it's a good typeface? How about Bank Gothic? ;)"

  body: "When I was in high school Eurostile was everywhere, especially on institutional
    publications (yearbooks, annual reports, etc.). I don't remember associating it
    with technology, but it seemed to embody all the qualities that I, as a nerdy
    teenage boy, aspired to: Masculine, cosmopolitan, modern. If it were a fictional
    character, it would have been James Bond: A tough guy in a tux. \r\nI don't use
    it much anymore, probably because of all that adolescent emotional baggage I have
    attached to it. "

    a face just because it's fallen \"out of style.\"\r\nReminds me of my old by-line:
    \"Yes, I'm old, but I'm back in style.\"\r\nAs for Aldo Novarese, he spoke of
    a revised cut of Eurostile family (late 1980s/early 1990s) if Agfa could license.
    I don't think that ever happened, but his last typeface was with Agfa."

  body: "Hrant,\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s only nostalgia if you think that the old stuff was,
    somehow, better. My wife is an awful lot like that: I am having a hell of a time
    convincing her to give up on a chair that we bought at Sam\u2019s Club for sixty-five
    dollars twenty years ago, and at least give a new one a try at the local La-Z-Boy
    showroom. She will have none of it. Consequently, I am thinking about shaving
    off my mustache and moving with her to Amish Country. At least then, we\u2019ll
    be living in a century she seems inclined to feel more comfortable with.\r\n\r\nNick
    Shinn is quite correct that it\u2019s a magnificent design, and was very up-to-the-minute
    when it was first released. As a result, it was immensely popular\u2014at least,
    to the <em>cognoscenti</em>\u2014and got a lot of exposure.\r\n\r\nJust the right
    amount of ice cream is heaven; too much ice cream is brain-freeze hell\u2014and
    worse, down the digestive tract. In instances when the typeface matches the timbre
    of speech which it enunicates, it\u2019s still a no-brainer choice."

    Like Mojo I first came across it when I was no'but a lad. It was a trendy, modern
    face when I was an apprentice comp. in the sixties and I longed to work for a
    company that had such faces available. I loved\u2014and still do love\u2014that
    a; there's something very pert and insolent about it, especially in the extended
    variants.\r\n\r\nIt was around the same time that I bought a second-hand leather
    arm chair for my first 'pad'. It cost thirty shillings. I still have it. The leather
    is scuffed and split and crudely patched but I could no more consider throwing
    it out than I could consider cutting off an arm.\r\n\r\nIt was in that chair I
    sat and also read almost everything that Asimov wrote.\r\n\r\nWhilst I understand
    the point you make Nick, I don't feel that any of those examples are in the same
    league; but I would probably use them for the reasons you suggest."
