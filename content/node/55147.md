  sites to name it. I've got pages and pages of material with this font, but I tried
  to show a sample that includes lots of capital letters and the lowercase letter
  \"y\". If a different sample would help please let me know. Also, just in case it's
  a clue this scan is from a 2001 publication.\r\n\r\nAnyone recognize this font?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_3670.png]"
