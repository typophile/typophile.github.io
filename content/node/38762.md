  To toaday I saw several on which the letter spacing was scrunched to almost nothing.
  \r\n\r\nToo bad. They could have easily used a wider blade or a narrower version.
  (say, 3W instead of 5W) I'll snap some photos on the weekend. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Are you referring to the blue Clearview signs on light poles at major intersections,
    the white Clearview signs on residential streets, or the new business that Jerry
    Kramer managed to sell the city? (If it\u2019s that one, where did you see it?
    And why the hell don\u2019t you always have a camera on you?)\r\n\r\n\u2014  \r\nJoe

    hour and ... never mind the sign's not going anywhere. Text messaging while driving
    is challenge enough. :P\r\n\r\nThere were several in a row on Yonge Street, just
    south of York Mills (near south exit from York Mills Station.\r\n\r\ndberlow,
    You win... Well, actually, this sort of thing should be very easy to control.
    sign makers <em>are</em> capable of working to specifications. They do it all
    the time for commercial signs that are far less important than road signs that
    people are supposed to be able to read from a car on a city street designed for
    80 clicks but signed for 50. All that has happen is for some one realize it matters
    and give a damn.\r\n\r\nR"

    depending on what you mean by \"terrible minion\" or who you ask... <b>[insert
    self-deprecating humourous smiley here]</b>and, occasionally, we bureaucrats and
    dreadful minions manage to do things like build bridges that don't fall down (very
    often) and drive trains on time (on time being defined as... :o) or make readable
    signs. As you know,there is a lot of garbage made in the private sector as well
    as the public. In the public sector it really is simply a matter of saying, THOU
    SHALT NOT SMOOSH LETTERS OR MESS WITH LETTER SPACING. (and meaning it)\r\n\r\n(edited,
    'cause I seem to have a a facility for killing my own threads... I meant that
    \"I'm either a bureaucrat \" comment to sound more like a \"hey, I resemble that
    remark\" sort of thing. Sorry, James, if this post came of as testy and defensive
    as it seems to me today.)\r\nR"

    our logo, I said 'go for it' as I had had enough of design-by-committee after
    creating our first logo for them in-house.\r\n\r\nSo, they went out, got an OK
    logo. Bland, but the committee agreed on it, and that was that.\r\n\r\nThen they
    asked me to create the branding style guide and manual like I had done for my
    own logo a year earlier, but cut and paste this new logo in to replace the one
    I had done.\r\n\r\nI had to explain to them 3 times that the style guide and manual
    was based on a specific logo and that if they want this for the new logo (which
    they should have) they need to have the firm that created it do it for them.\r\n\r\nThe
    never got around to it.\r\n\r\nOh well.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I agree with russell...this
    isn't a .gov thing. This is a big-organization thing. The only difference is that
    corporations are able to spend a bit more money in this realm without being criticized
    by legislature.\r\n\r\n"
