body: "Hi there, I'm currently looking for a geometric sans serif with a design similar
  to Kabel Light, but, if possible, with some alternate glyphs to give it more personality.
  I'm inspired by a typeface designed by Ian Party, named Sang Bleu 5, which unfortunately
  is not for sale:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ianparty.com/index.php?id=6\r\n\r\nI'm also fascinated
  by the design of a late 60's British team, Bentley/Farrell/Burnett, and the use
  they made of (apparently) hand-made variations on the Avant Garde / Kabel lineage:\r\n\r\nhttp://mikedempsey.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5532538c48833011169029392970c-800wi\r\n\r\nhttp://mikedempsey.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5532538c48833011169028bb7970c-800wi\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
