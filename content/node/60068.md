  been trying to identify the font used for \"Angst\" since October. I'd greatly appreciate
  any help... it's been bugging me! \r\n\r\nAlso, on the bottom font for \"Hotel and
  Residence\", I've received one reply with the font of Luxury (Gold). Yes?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKostandinos"

  body: The 'ANGST' part is based on the [[http://www.liceoaprosio.it/Scuola/Siti%20Internet/Nuova%20cartella/Spazio/Palmero/Hotel%20Angst.htm|old
    hand-drawn logo]], so I reckon you are out of luck in finding a particular font
    that matches. The subline in the sample really is too small to be certain, it
    could be any number of  typefaces.

  body: Do you work at the Carbone Smolan Agency in New York? They're the agency that
    created the new look... I even wrote to them last year but didn't receive a reply...
    I might try again. Thanks for that amazing link!
