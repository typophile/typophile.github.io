  (This is for testing web fonts - testing exactly which font file in the @font-face
  stack the browser is displaying. In other words, is it the EOT, the WOFF, the SVG,
  the Data URI - which one is the browser using?)\r\n\r\nThe question is: Which Unicode
  position to use for this purpose? (Latin-centric.)\r\n\r\nThe main boundary condition
  is that there be a near zero chance of conflict with a glyph that already exists
  in the font. And if there is a conflict, that there be no unwanted side effects
  stemming from simply replacing it with the marking glyph.\r\n\r\nRight now, the
  best candidate seems to be the Apple logo from the MacRoman codepage with a position
  in the Private Use area, Unicode 63743 (U+F8FF).\r\n\r\nAnybody see a problem with
  this?\r\n\r\nAnybody have a better idea?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRich"

    haven't mentioned?\r\n\r\nOr.... why not just use a regular glyph position, and
    replace the content? Take a common character (say, numeral 1) and replace it with
    a glyph that displays the name of the format. So the EOT font has a glyph that
    says \"EOT\" and so on. Start with a font that has a license that permits this,
    probably an open source thingie.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "My understanding is that Apple, inc. objects to font developers putting an
    Apple, inc. logo in the U+F8FF position unless the font in question is licensed
    for distribution by Apple, inc., but I cannot provide a citation for that.\r\n\r\nSince
    that position is in the Private Use Area, according to Unicode rules you can put
    whatever you want in there. That's what the PUA is for. But, since it is part
    of the MacRoman encoding, there is somewhat of a compulsion to fill the slot.
    Some font developers use that spot for a foundry logo or signature glyph of various
    sorts, or an apple dingbat that doesn't resemble the Apple, inc. logo. Also, U+F8FF
    is claimed by the [[http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html|Conscript
    Unicode Registry]] for the end of the Klingon script range.\r\n\r\nYou may wish
    to choose a different PUA position for your test glyph if these potential conflicts
    will interfere with your experiment."

    actual drawing of the apple, and, possibly, the glyph name \"apple\". They most
    certainly don't apply to a use of any particular codepoint. \r\n\r\nIndeed, quite
    a few font vendors have been using U+F8FF to put a vendor sign there. So this
    seems to be good practice. Rather than using the glyph name \"apple\", I recommend
    to use the glyph name \"uniF8FF\", which will keep your hands 100% clean. "

    also used for foundry logos and is therefore already being used as a marker.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Adam is quite right: Apple certainly doesn't have any dibs on the unicode position,
    just the logo. Leave Apple's name out of it, and there's no confusion.\r\n\r\nNow,

  body: "Oh, I see. Essentially, what you're asking for is a glyph that, in a way,
    should be unique in every font file (even format). Interesting concept. I've never
    thought about this in that way. \r\n\r\nI doubt the industry will ever agree on
    a \"standard practice\" here. This would involve a rather different workflow:
    you'd need separate fonts that you feed into the WOFF and EOT conversion workflow.
    I doubt many people will do that. \r\n\r\nThat having said that, the entire Private
    Use Area is at your disposal. U+F8FF could be one candidate, a neighbor codepoint
    (e.g. U+F8FE) or perhaps the very first PUA codepoint (U+E000) could be other
    candidates. But the point obviously is that PUA is, by definition, private. So
    not much chance to get it adopted as an industry-wide standard practice. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    I doubt that you'd really need to include such character is every single webfont
    that is shipping, right? It's enough to produce a set of test fonts which all
    have a different glyph in the same codepoint. Actually, this is something I might
    have a chance to get around doing. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Latin-0, and Windows ANSI to form a basic Western Latin plus extras that most

    the page normally is displayed? Why don\u2019t you simply provide fonts on the

    had not to replace the character in each of the fonts, that you want to test,

    The page shall be displayed in Charter and you have embedded Charter.woff and
    Charter.eot. Additionally you embed fonts, that are called Woff.woff and Eot.eot.
    The font Woff.woff contains the letter W and the font Eot.eot the letter E on
    the position of the apple for example. And your stack would be \"font-family:

    recommended to include at least one complete Windows 8-bit codepage in every font,
    and to accurately identify this codepage in the OS/2 table codepage range. MS
    Office apps still make use of text libraries that perform font switching based
    on codepage support. If a font does not support at least one codepage, it might
    not work at all in some MS apps.\r\n\r\n[This is true even if the intended script
    support for the font is something that never had a Windows 8-bit codepage defined,
    e.g. Devanagari. So when we make a font for such a script we include support for
    the Win CP 1252 Latin.]"
