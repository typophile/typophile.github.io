body: "Dear Typophile,\r\n\r\nWhat is the convention when mixing small caps and lower
  case in the same word?  \r\n\r\nFor instance, if I am setting all abbreviations
  in small caps, I might have the phrase \u2018he had two DVDs on his shelf\u2019.
  \ How do I stop it looking like \u2018he had two DVDS on his shelf\u2019 (you have
  to imagine these large caps are small caps!).  \r\n\r\nAnother example might be
  a possessive. \u2018the new DVD\u2019s cover was blank\u2019.  In theory it's okay,
  but in some typefaces the lower case S actually comes out larger than the small
  caps, which looks a little striking.   \r\n\r\nAre there any conventions here?  Or
  tips people have found from experience look best when mixing small caps and lower
  case in the same word?\r\n\r\nAll best wishes,\r\n\r\nDrudge\r\n"

  body: "Drudge, I do not have an answer to your exact question. These types of problems,
    using small caps in technical writing, have come up in the past:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/84025\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/89876\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/92747\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/99592\r\n\r\nSome
    people (like me) say forget small caps for this purpose. Just use a font where
    the capital letters are definitely smaller than the full height letters, such
    as Gentium, Greta Text, or Malabar. Or even use a font where the capital letters
    are somewhat smaller than full height, like Skolar. And don't even mess with the
    small caps problems.\r\n\r\nSome people say use a font where the small caps are
    definitely higher than the x-height. But there are not too many fonts designed
    like this, even though this is what is needed for tech writing.\r\n\r\nSome people
    say Drudge, just use your good judgment, buddy.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone else will
    have a better answer."

  body: "If you have to (or want to) stick with small caps, there are two options:
    If you are bound to a certain typeface, you have to live with the way it looks.
    If you are not, do what J. Tillmann suggests in his third paragraph: select a
    typeface that has tall small caps. Here are some examples, good and bad. Scala
    and Maiola in the first and second line make it hard for the reader to tell apart
    small caps and lowercase. Kepler in the third line and Chaparral in the last are
    better in this respect.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/smallcaps_4852.png]"

    small caps.

    are quite a few. \r\nHaving faced the same predicament as Drudge when I was art
    directing, I for one have subsequently always made my small caps signi\uFB01cantly
    taller than x-height."
