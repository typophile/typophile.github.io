body: "This workshop was originally scheduled for 6/15, but had to be postponed. If
  you're in SoCal, I hope to see some of you a week from tomorrow instead! \r\n\r\nContracts
  for Creative Professionals \r\nSaturday, July 20, 2013 \r\n9:00 AM to 1:00 PM \r\nThe
  Hub Los Angeles \r\n830 Traction Ave. #3A \r\nLos Angeles, CA 90013 \r\nhttp://contractsforcreativepros.eventbrite.com/
  (Please note that this is a different link than before) \r\n\r\nContracts mystify
  many creative professionals, yet they are the lifeblood of the trade. In this workshop,
  geared towards freelance creatives and small agencies, we will work together to
  understand contracts and see how they can be used as a tool to do better work, make
  more money and keep clients happy. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will teach the basics of
  how contracts work, how to approach contract negotiation as a collaborative process,
  explain important and common contract clauses and offer guidance on when and how
  to seek help drafting or enforcing contracts. \r\n\r\nHere is what you will learn,
  at the very least: \r\n\r\n\u2022 What a contract is and how it is formed. \r\n\u2022
  How contracts are structured. \r\n\u2022 Common contract clauses. \r\n\u2022 Typical
  issues in creative contracts. \r\n\u2022 How to approach contracts with your clients
  in a non-adverserial way. \r\n\u2022 Using online signing services to make the process
  painless. \r\n\u2022 How to find and adapt basic contracts. \r\n\u2022 How to enforce
  contracts. \r\n\u2022 How to work with an attorney to draft, modify and enforce
  contracts. \r\n\r\nSince this is an early \"beta\" of what we hope will become a
  valuable, repeatable event for the creative community, participation in this first
  workshop will be limited to just 10 people and cost only $89. \r\n\r\nAbout the
  Organizers \r\n\r\nJonathan Tobin is a California attorney and worked as a graphic
  designer and web developer for over a decade. He helps creators, makers and innovators
  use the law to become more successful. \r\n\r\nSpencer Cross is an LA-based designer
  and artist. He is an evangelist for the LA design community and works to foster
  community and camaraderie among LA-area creative professionals by coordinating a
  variety of social and educational events and discussion forums."
