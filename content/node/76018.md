  body: Many common word processors, such as Microsoft Word and Lotus Word Pro, include
    mathematical formula builders. Since this is an uncommon feature, you may have
    to change which components of the software package are installed to have access
    to this feature.

  body: I'm not aware of any add-ons that enable one to typeset maths directly in
    InDesign. What I do is set the Math in MS Word 2007 (for Windows), print or export
    to a PDF, and then position the PDF as a graphic in InDesign. MS Word 2007 has
    a built in maths handler and the Cambria Math font that contains maths layout
    tables.

  body: "For InDesign, there is [[http://mathmagic.com/|MathMagic]], an equation editor
    compatible with Word and LaTeX. If your original came from Word, InDesign can
    import its Equation Editor formulas as images \u2013in this case, you may need
    to reopen some formulas in Equation Editor to edit image size, but it works correctly."

  body: Like John, I'd probably import in a PDF, though I'd use LaTeX.  Depending
    on how many you have, the PDF option (from either LaTeX or Word) is going to the
    best option.  If you have to set a lot of them, then I'd look at other software
    that can let you work within InDesign.

  body: "There's also an add-on called \"InMath\" for InDesign/InCopy. I don't think
    they have a CS5 version as yet, but they do CS2-CS4. (I have no particular knowledge
    of its merits or failings, and am not endorsing it, just saying I've heard of
    it.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: If you're importing formulas as images, in some cases it may be helpful to
    place them as inline graphics, so they'll reflow with the text. (Rather than as
    standard graphics which stay in the same position on the page even if the text
    reflows.)

  body: Well, assuming that you have all the characters, an old-time comp like me
    would use tabs. I'd think ID's *table* structure could be bent to help.

  body: "A wealth of info and options--cheeers.\r\n\r\nI neglected to add that I originally
    scanned the calculations and text with Abbyy Finereader. Unfortunately, the OCR
    software cannot properly read and render the calculations like standard text (it
    tries to convert it all the unique glyphs to standard text). Now I'm capturing
    all the needed calculations as pictures in Finereader, saving to Word, then printing
    to PDF and inserting as inline graphics. It's a convoluted route leading to barely
    passable results. The PDF of the scanned characters vary somewhat in terms of
    line thickness--hard to get clean, consistent results that matched in weight and
    rendering with the text."

  body: "There will probably be many instances of this sort where someone will not
    be willing to re-enter the equations and will have to resort to the sort of solution
    you've settled on. I might point out for others, though, that the recommendation
    to utilize Word was predicated on one actually creating the equations in Word,
    and then porting these into InDesign. So what you have ended up doing, so far
    as I can tell, is just add extra unnecessary steps to the procedure\u2014if you
    are scanning the images there is little reason to make those scans into PDFs,
    rather you could just place the images directly into the InD file. The principal
    reason to make PDFs from a Word-typeset equation is to have an equation that is
    not of fixed resolution and therefore is better suited for print purposes and
    is scalable. This, incidentally, is an issue using plugins which rely on plopping
    images into the InD source, although the ability to have an active, editable linked
    equation is important in many workflows.\r\n\r\nAside from the sort of situation
    you ended up in, there are several solutions to choose from. Most do rely on creating
    the equation in Word, and then exporting some object (image or otherwise) back
    to InDesign. InMath allows for the creation of equations directly in InDesign
    using arbitrary fonts (that is, unlike many proprietary systems, is not reliant
    on its own set of custom fonts). This approach has its weaknesses, as do all solutions
    at some level\u2014but generally could be summed up as not having all the refinements
    one might want that are available to a purpose-built Math font and layout system.
    It would probably be acceptable for many situations, and in many regards may not
    be any worse then other options\u2014it all depends on what compromises to quality
    you are willing to make.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of those who might want to take advantage
    of the native equation editing features present in Word 2007 & Word 2010 (Windows-only),
    then I have made up [[http://www.tiro.com/Articles/Word_to_InD_Math.pdf|this document]]
    which describes one simple solution for the porting of Word-made equations to
    an InDesign source."
