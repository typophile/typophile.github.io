    have a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/sports_script/">these</a>.

  body: "It's not nearly the same thing, I quite like the font you found better, but
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/roundhand/black/\">Roundhand
    Black BT</a> appears to have some of the same influence.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/pivo/regular/\">Pivo</a>
    also seems to have some similar glyphs, but then with only four available to compare,
    it is difficult to do a good comparison.\r\n\r\nObviously, neither of these are
    the same font but they all seem to hail from a similar background. I'll try to
    clean up the image you submitted to help with the comparison process and get back
    to you. Sorry I couldn't be more help.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] Even with the clean-up, I
    still can't find a single result that looks promising. I'm starting to think that
    it is custom [/EDIT]"
