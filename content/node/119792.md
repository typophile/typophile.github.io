  cover, specifically the font used for 'OUTLIERS' and 'MALCOLM GLADWELL':\r\n\r\nI
  initially thought it might be 'Raleway' because of the 'W', but this font is rounded
  :/\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/malcolm-gladwell-outliers_4305.jpg]"
