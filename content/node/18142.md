  in FontLab. This is an odd sans serif I am working on. This is obviously more of
  a display face, not sure how legible it would be at small sizes. I look forward
  to your thoughts.\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: Nice. I like the name, too. I would mirror the o's; it looks kind of like
    it might say "epistr<strong>a</strong>phy," and the captial O could potentially
    read as a D or Q.

    body: Thanks for the thoughts. It is named after a Thelonious Monk song. I was
      a little torn when I was creating the "O"s  I was trying to make them a bit
      different. Maybe I went too far. Thanks again!
