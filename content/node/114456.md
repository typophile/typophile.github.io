body: I'm wondering if technically speaking a ligature must be two letters that are
  joined together, or, can you have a ligature in which there are 2 letters designed
  to work together but don't actually join?

  body: If the two letterforms are coded as one character, it's a ligature whether
    they visually touch or not, just as the original ligatures were two letters cast
    on one piece of metal. If they're alternate forms of single letters designed to
    fit together (e.g., a lowercase <strong>i</strong> with no dot, intended to form
    a kerning pair after a lowercase <strong>f</strong> or a capital <strong>T</strong>),
    they're not ligatures, technically speaking.

  body: "The word has been used in both contexts. Some called two letters cast together,
    that did not touch, a logotype, and reserved \"ligature\" for  letter pairs that
    did touch. For example,  Vo, Wo, To etc. were special sorts on the Linotype lincecaster,
    where kerning was not possible. Some people termed these \"logotyopes,\" not ligatures,
    in distinction to fi, fl, etc.  -- Adrian Wilson was one, IIRC. However, as advertising
    took on greater and greater significance in the world of type, company logos also
    became known as \"logotypes.\"\r\n\r\nAs with so many things, the use of this
    term seems to have undergone a change, and most of us today would be comfortable
    with \"ligature\" even when the components did not touch. Use the terms as you
    prefer."

  body: Unless sizing, tracking, or H&J are important to the typography, the difference
    between logos and ligatures is not. In the red zone however, if all three of those
    things are playing on glyph selection at once, something's going to want to know
    the difference, trust me.

  body: Wouldn't a letter pair which doesn't touch be considered either a digraph
    or a contextual ligature these days?

  body: "No to both. \r\n\r\nA contextual ligature would be a ligature used only in
    certain situations -- effectively, when following or preceding certain other letters.
    I suppose the context could be size -- use to be, you didn't use the f-ligatures
    above about 14-point. Anyway, nothing to say about whether or not the letterforms
    touch.\r\n\r\nFrom Wiktipedia:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>A digraph or digram is a pair
    of characters used to write one phoneme or a sequence of phonemes that does not
    correspond to the normal values of the two characters combined<blockquote>"

  body: "I meant either a digraph or a contextual ligature, not both. I can see now
    that contextual ligatures are too specific and don't really have any relevance
    here. Still, I would like to clarify that I was thinking of contextual ligatures
    for improved spacing, not these elaborate ligatures you find in script fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think I'm necessarily wrong about the digraph though. I know what it is,
    but usually it's a letter pair which doesn't touch. It's certainly not encompassing
    as I initially foolishly alluded to, but it's one of the things a letter pair
    can be without being a ligature. "

  body: I'm not so sure, Martin. My understanding is that a digraph is a linguistic
    thing first, and a typographic thing second. It exists regardless of whether it
    gets special typographic treatment, and when it does get special typographic treatment,
    that isn't usually modifying one or more of two separate glyphs.
