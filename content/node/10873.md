  body: It&#39;s odd that Rand himself offered to redesign the logo as he was admittedly
    &#39;uncomfortable&#39; with parts of it, and UPS always declined... and now they
    come up with this swooshy 3D thing. <BR> <BR>Am I the only one who thinks FF Dax
    was an odd choice &#40;especially considering everyone and their dog are using
    it these days&#41;? I don&#39;t know, but in my head the two &#40;UPS and Dax&#41;
    don&#39;t quite mix.

    adverts. They went and Chisel extruded some metallic grey text and then drop-shadowed
    it onto a red background. Its like all of a sudden British design is taking its
    influences from American banks and Bling-Bling Rap albums. Next thing you know,
    The Royal Bank of Scotland will Diamonte-encrust its logo or something. Hideous.
    So much for the reputation...

    is trying to look important. Plus, I am the only one that thinks the stock photography
    people shots are silly?  They keep showing people and computers, but no packages
    or people delivering them. Weird to me.

    The same uproar happened in the <BR>design community when AT&amp;T 3D&#39;d their
    <BR>already 3D looking 2D logo. I would say in <BR>both cases, they are still
    effective logos. <BR>Mainly because both companies are willing <BR>to implement

  body: If Rand wasn&#39;t happy with it, then why dwell on it? Obviously he did not
    like it. And I would tend to agree with his opinion first. It was a poor decision
    for UPS to accept the first logo and similar dedcision making on this new one
    too. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t care for the new one either, but the string HAD to go.
    When was the last time any of us saw a package with string? In the industry that
    UPS and FEDEX are in I can see how any reference to the &#34;old&#34; or &#34;archaic&#34;
    would be a bad thing. No matter how much we as designers may like the traditional.
    <BR> <BR>But I am interested to see how they translate the new logo to one color
    printing. Or even two color. That element of Rand&#39;s original that made the
    old logo so universal. <BR> <BR>I had also heard that the reason that UPS went
    with the color brown in the first place was legal. I forget the details I heard,
    but UPS was required &#40;legally somehow&#41; to &#34;down-play&#34; their presence.
    Can anyone recall this legal issue?

    played out in almost everything -- brown, the  <BR>shield, the name. United Parcel

    its reason to change, being &#34;outdated&#34; is retarded.  The string, bow and
    parcel weren&#39;t used in the first place because Rand or UPS beleived that&#39;s
    the way they delivered packages. Its because its a &#34;gift&#34; and relates
    to the emotional level of receiving a delivery. Saying it was outdated to logistics
    is like re-designing Col. Saunders head shot with a business suit and tie,  giving

    The throw-away attitude about design among major U.S. companies like UPS and Verizon
    is such a dramatic contrast with the Netherlands, where it seems like every square
    inch of the country has been well thought out and artfully designed. &#40;Not
    to slight any other Euros, it&#39;s one of the few European countries I&#39;ve
    visited.&#41; Payphones, grocery stores, public toilets, sidewalks... they&#39;re
    all beautiful in their attention to detail and their functionality. That was my
    impression, anyway.
