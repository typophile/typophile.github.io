  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Is there a specific reason, while testing kerning, that my typeface looks pretty decent at 12, 13, 15, 16 pts. and virtually all others, but looks absolutely terrible at 14 points &hellip; in every program I use to test it? Currently I am using Microsoft Works' word processor, among others, for testing but it doesn&rsquo;t matter which one I use. I am confounded and at a loss - even when I alter pairs to compensate for the kerning disparity at 14 points, then it only looks correct at 14 points and no other sizes. Is it my computer or is there some obvious typographical rule I&rsquo;m missing here?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good question - actually, just on the screen. It&rsquo;s strange because I could have the word &ldquo;responsible,&rdquo; let&rsquo;s say, at 15 points and looking good. I change just the word to 13 points with the rest of the text staying at 15, and it still looks good. Change that same word to 14 points however, and not only does it then take on the characteristics of the famous &ldquo;HOLLYWOOD&rdquo; sign, the kerning looks like a parody. This is really just one of a million problems, but the most annoying. For example, when  at anything but 14 points, the lower-case &ldquo;s&rdquo; looks fine but at 14 points, it looks 85 percent as tall as the remaining lower-case letters.</p>
<p>Are there any sure-fire programs to test these things on screen? Notepad doesn&rsquo;t apply kerning, nor does WordPad - at least not in my versions of them. I&rsquo;m just hoping to find something a little reliable. One font I created looked good but when it got to the myfonts.com site its kerning was to typography was what the movie &ldquo;Airplane!&rdquo; was to the Oscars.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">For that matter, on occasion when I change the size of the text when testing, I&rsquo;ll even notice small variations in the kerning at different points, 12, 13, 14, and so on. And not always between the same pairs. Sometimes the pair &ldquo;hn&rdquo; is in bed together at 14 points, a mile apart at 16 points, and lovers again at 18 points. I&rsquo;m far from being a kerning expert, but this doesn&rsquo;t add up mathematically, visually, or scientifically. The space should expand or decrease - seemingly - by some sort of ratio one way or the other in a consistent manner.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Are you kidding? Nurse say she be back on the med-side. I LOVE Airplane, but unfortunately Oscar has different tastes. I have followed your advice regarding the change in viewing size, and it does make a difference for the good. However, my biggest difficulty is trying to figure out which view is the one most likely to be replicated to others, or on their screens. For example, will my font universally appear to others as it does to me on my screen at 13 points and 116 percent magnification?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;d agree with Tiffany re hinting, also on-screen if you get four out of five sizes looking &lsquo;decent&rsquo; I think you&rsquo;ve got lucky. If 14pt is really important to you maybe scale the design, making the 13 the 14? Anyway visuals would help.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;if you get four out of five sizes looking ’decent’ I think you’ve got lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really? If that&rsquo;s the case, is there a universal point-size most people attempt to make look good? Or does everyone just try to make all point sizes look as good as possible?</p>
<p>I would love to provide visuals, but it&rsquo;s so erratic I don&rsquo;t think I could with any consistency..</p>
<p>If this helps: occasionally when I have the letters &ldquo;guild&rdquo; together and the kerning looks correct, I will do something like delete the letter &ldquo;i&rdquo; and the kerning between the g and u goes from correct to the letters practically being on top of each other. I must be missing some kind of setting or something, some output protocol I have either set or need to unset. Whatever the case, I can&rsquo;t imagine I&rsquo;m having the same problems everyone&rsquo;s having or there&rsquo;d be nothing but insane typographers everywhere ready to pull out their hair.</p>
