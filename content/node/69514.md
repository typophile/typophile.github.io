body: This display version of Karmina Regular was developed for a particular client
  with a specific set of requirements in mind. The client is using the full Karmina
  family for all their communication materials and needed a version for large size
  applications, as big as billboards. They liked the sturdiness and low contrast of
  Karmina and didn't want to loose those features too much in the display version.
  After several presentations and more extreme variants, we nailed the design. The
  contrast is rather low for a display version, but the overall feel of the typeface
  is elegant, slim and yet sturdy enough. Both parties are very happy with the result
  and we look forward to see some applications.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comparison_6499.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/KarminaDisplay_poster_6295.gif]

    the x-height and the cap height... the typeface definitely has a nice feel to
    it. I like the corner that's cut off on the \"e\" as well."
