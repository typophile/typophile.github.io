  body: I think it looks like a faux stencil font made by overlaying a white strip
    over parts of the letters. The M is what looks wrong to me as a stencil pattern.
    Except for that M I would say FF DIN could have been used. Maybe Linotype&#39;s

    target="_blank">Rundfunk Grotesk</a> would fit it.
