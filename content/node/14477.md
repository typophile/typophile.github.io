  body: While the letters which match are the same, I wonder if it isn't a cut-and-paste
    lettering project in illustrator?

      the same font for some titles inside the magazine as well...\r\n\r\nNow, it
      takes quite a lot of effort to put together all those letters all the time...maybe
      it is really a font? "

  body: It seems to me they have a few basic shapes which they've converted into the
    typeface. You might start with dissecting the shapes. It could turn into a fun
    side project for you.

  body: "I assume that at least the lc 'l' has been customized ... I find it difficult
    to imagine that any foundry would dare to market a font with such a screwed up
    character, turning \"london\" into \"jondon\". I'd be hard pressed to find a reason
    why anyone would mirror an 'l' that would otherwise (i. e. the right way around)
    fit just fine into the font.\r\n\r\nPlease excuse my small-mindedness. :)\r\n\r\njpg"

  body: "Hi hrant. I certainly don't depreciate character mirroring/flipping. Suburban's
    flipped 'el' (I adopt your notation of the lc 'L') and 'y' are a pretty, thought-out
    design feature and neither prone to be confused with each other nor with any other
    character of that font.\r\n\r\nUnlike that, the mirrored 'el' in the above font
    is very likely to be read as a 'j'. (In fact, it will only be recognized as an
    'el' when its context - the word - rules out a 'j'. While such ambiguity is common
    with certain characters such as 'el', 'I' and '1', there is, IMHO, no need to
    invent new sources of confusion.) That mirrored 'l' is, in my view, an injudicious,
    pointless modification of the letterform, not adding any sophistication to the
    font, but definitely impairing its readability. I'd like to see \"Jolly Joker\"
    set in the above unknown font.\r\n\r\njpg"
