  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there,

   I'm working on an auto-kerning tool.  It's free and open source.  If you're interested in taking a look, I'd love to hear your feedback.  

<a href="http://charlesmchen.github.com/typefacet/topics/autokern/index.html">TypeFacet Autokern Project Pages</a>

   As a demonstration, I've used Autokern to re-kern two popular open source fonts: League Gothic and Linden Hill (both from the League of Type).  Here are direct links to before-and-after comparisons:

<a href="http://charlesmchen.github.com/typefacet/topics/autokern/league_gothic/sample_texts.html">League Gothic</a>

<a href="http://charlesmchen.github.com/typefacet/topics/autokern/linden_hill/sample_texts.html">Linden Hill</a>

   I took the fonts' original kerning as a point of departure when configuring Autokern.

Thomas Phinney: It's not linear.  The algorithm uses linear calculations only for the upper and lower bounds of glyph spacing. ie. the user set a hard lower bound for how close two glyphs can be, and this is enforced linearly. The actual spacing algorithm is rather complicated. I intend to document it once I've settled upon some of the details... </div>

Pablo, I got the same problem as you. Here on Ubuntu I solved it by installing the package python-yaml which also loads libyaml-0-2

Now I’m stuck with the following error:
<code>
python Autokern.py -h
Traceback (most recent call last):

PabloImpallari: As georg pointed out, the yaml module doesn't come with Python 2.6.  I'm going to modify the installation guide today to work for Python 2.6.
vernon adams: It should be usable from robofont. I was wondering whether or not to make a robofont plugin.  I actually think it might be easier to work with outside robofont using the Autokern's HTML logs than using robofont's Kerning view.
georg: I'm going to try to make Autokern Python 2.6 compatible today.

An observation :)
This is a very interesting piece of work, and i'm thinking could your methods and libs not also be applied to 'spacing' a font too? aka finding the best values for left & right sidebearings before looking for values for kerning pairs?

		<div class="commentbody">georg: I believe I've resolved your locale issue.
vernon adams: by default autokern does both auto-spacing and auto-kerning.  If you just want the auto-kerning, use the --do-not-modify-side-bearings argument. 

To be clear, Autokern is very early in its development process.  The results are not very good yet, and I'm still in the process of trying new approaches.  I think the results have improved quite a bit in the last few days alone.

Right now, I'm looking for two things: 
a) critiques (as detailed as possible) of the current output from a type designer's point of view.  See the samples:
http://charlesmchen.github.com/typefacet/topics/autokern/league_gothic/sample_texts.html
http://charlesmchen.github.com/typefacet/topics/autokern/linden_hill/sample_texts.html

b) anyone who'd like to discuss kerning theory and automation.

Cheers!

Some pointers for those needing help. I followed the following (nabbed from http://mirror.umd.edu/roswiki/electric(2f)Installation(2f)OSX(2f)Homebrew.html) to get the proper dependencies, e.g. libyaml &  pyyaml installed.

1. Change the permissions of your Python, Ruby, and Perl library directories to prevent the need for sudo when running pip. This is recommended by the Homebrew developers.

<code>sudo chown -R $USER /Library/Ruby /Library/Perl /Library/Python </code>

2. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file (make a .bashrc file if you dont have one)
<code>export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH"</code>

3. Install cmake for build systems and libyaml for reading configuration files:

<code>brew install cmake libyaml --universal</code>

4. Install pip, which is a package manager for Python, using easy_install:

<code>sudo easy_install pip</code>

5.Install PyYaml, the python interface to libyaml:

Anyhow, please let me know if you need any help.
 
@eliason Thank you.  One thing I've tried (but failed) to avoid in the examples was confusing Autokern's algorithm with its configuration. Autokern behavior is very dependent on its configuration (ie. its arguments, collectively). I believe many of the problems you've identified can be fixed by altering the configuration rather than modify Autokern itself.  I'll try to update the examples accordingly when I can.

Digging into terminal commands (or Python for that matter) is a very steep wall to climb for many, if not most, type designers. I suggest you give it a simple interface to see if it gains traction. As other have noted: Spacing (incl. kerning) and drawing cannot be separated in professional type design. Keep that in mind. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Now have this running under GNU/Linux (fedora + ubuntu). To get this running i installed latest 'Robo_Fab560M_plusDependencies' from robofab.org, then typefacet is running without hitch.

My experience so far, is that typefacet can create the appearance of adequate-good spacing, but it is relying too much on kerning pairs to achieve that :D (not good practice). However, by running the scripts selectively with the --only-modify-side-bearings arg on e.g. just lowercase, uppercase and both, i think i can see useful potential for the tool. It seems to do a pretty good job of getting the widths right, even when the side bearings are off :) so potentially very usefull for pre- manual spacing. Also potentially good tool for primary stages of font development to space glyphs in order to aid the optical widths etc of new glyphs and the emerging face. Certainly better than other auto spacing tools imho. Pretty sure this will get better. Maybe needs to be forked into separate 'spacing tool' and 'kerning tool'??</div>

@PabloImpallari: Thank you for your persistence. I think I resolved this issue yesterday. Please try again.
@vernon adams: Thanks for the thoughtful comments.  Autokern can now be run in three modes: auto-space only, auto-kern only or both.  All three modes can be limited in scope (ie. kern only these glyph categories, glyphs or pairs).  So I'm not sure if there's a need to divide it into separate tools.  But I think you're right that it's worth thinking over how these separate uses can or should be handled differently.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Charles - yes, i agree actual separate 'apps' are not necessary. For those interested, i've been testing on trying to get the amount of kerning pairs generated, way down, to anywhere between 200 - 1500 pairs, and still produce good spacing and kerning throughout a font. With that scenario i can see much better if the tool is able to produce good, funcional, and practical results. Takes a lot of tweaking ;) but i think i can see it does work, though i'm getting some results (a few kerned pairs) that are not what i would probably do manually, and i think i would manually tweak these later. So with simple sans-serifs (serif faces would likely respond differently) i'm getting best results with parameters like 
<code>--intrusion-tolerance-ems 0.0
--min-distance-ems 0.094
--max-distance-ems 0.095
--kerning-threshold-ems 0.0135
--max-x-extrema-overlap-ems 0.0
--precision-ems 0.0030</code>

Also helps to use something like
<code>--glyph-categories-to-ignore  P* S* C* N*</code>
to ignore numerals, punctuation, symbols, etc and then target these separately.

So, for instance, if one assumes that the sidebearings of H are correctly set, then there should never be kerning between HH, so that distance provides a control value for kerning. For each script, the user of the tool should be able to define the control glyphs between which no kerning should be applied and which provide the distance model for kerning in the font.</div>

I have been having some 'success' using the tool in this way; First i run Typefacet just targetting the side-bearings, tweaking the different parameters untill i get bearings that i 'know' are how side-side bearings should be, e.g. with a sans face, the left side of the 'H' 'B' 'D' 'E' 'F' etc are same(-ish), and all the bowls are same-ish, etc etc. Then i can run that .ufo through Typefacet, to kern only, and setting parameters to ignore certain pairs and/or glyphs. Like you say, by that point i know that e.g. the H-H etc should not be kerned, but i do know that e.g. the L-T will, or that an array of lowercase glyphs will need kerning to the right side of some uppercase glyphs. Of course this sort of routine would be sooo much easier when classes are introduced, and the user can exempt e.g. all glyphs in the 'H-left side' class, or kern only 'T' 'W' 'V' against a 'lowercase left sided bowl' class, i.e. 'c' 'd' 'e' 'o' 'q', or similar. A function that defined glyphs (or just left or right bearings of glyphs), or the space between certain pairs,  as 'controls' would be very handy. Good point!</div>

Autokern tools like this one and DTL KernMaster offer parametric controls of the algorithm, but in my experience these are only readily understandable and predictable to the person who created the algorithm: a user has to work by trial and error, not really understanding how varying different parameters affects outcomes. Type designers spacing type don't think in terms of parameters, but of iteratively refining spacing and kerning relative to standard distances established by key shapes. Ergo, it seems to me that a good autokern tool should try to find a way to make such distances a kind of front-end UI to the algorithm parameters.</div>

Yes, i 've been thinking exactly that myself. I had actually wondered if Typefacet was doing something like that; including exempt glyphs in calculations, but then only changing the values of non-exempt glyphs. It would definitely be interesting to see Typefacet able to do something like it. So certain side bearings can be marked by the designer as 'fixed' but are also 'blessed' as the cornerstones from which other relative values are calculated. </div>

However, although I believe that (good quality) kerning is inherently a manual, intuitive operation performed deep within a zone where the designer communes with the spatiality of the typeface, I do think that there are ways in which automated kerning might be integrated into the concept and design process of certain kinds of typeface. For instance <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/softmachine/">Softmachine</a>, in which every glyph is equidistant from its neighbour, at the closest proximity. I did that manually, but it would seem to be the sort of thing that could be automated.

Nick: ‘<em>[…] kerning is inherently a manual, intuitive operation performed deep within a zone where the designer communes with the spatiality of the typeface […]’</em>

Ah, here we go again: another coarse attempt to mystify the profession of the type designer. Kerning is nothing more than making rhythmical corrections on variants of structures and patterns that were ﬁxed sometime in history. Kerning becomes necessary when type is not completely coherent and consistent, like roman and italic type are by deﬁnition. The rhythmical corrections are for the rest purely relative to the (spacing of the) design; this is no hocus pocus or high level stuff, but simply explainable matter. That is why a lecturer can discuss the details of a student’s type design (including the kerning) after he agrees with the design’s basic principles. 

And for all the religious people on this forum who (want to) believe that the early punch cutters and casters purely relied on their eyes (like they [want to] believe they do themselves, which they don’t because they are conditioned to look at type as they do), some recent ﬁndings of my research are published <a href="http://www.facebook.com/dutchtypelibrary">here</a>.

You are the one doing the mystifying, hypothesizing a secret knowledge of the ancients.
I’m merely describing how I work, which I ﬁgured out by analyzing the different spacing schema that occur in type design and typesetting, rahter than relying on my conditioning.
I have identiﬁed at least different strategies for spacing:
- proximity 
- stroke regularity
- center of gravity
In any given glyph combination (including more than two glyphs), these principles may contradict, and it’s the purpose of taste and judgement to resolve those conﬂicts. That’s what design is, and it can’t be reduced to magic formulæ. Even if one starts from a matrix-based premise, one still has to decide which unitary value to assign to the awkward letters such as binocular g and s.

It’s OK to work numerically, but it’s not the best way to exercise taste in matters of spacing.

Let’s keep the humanity in type design, striking a balance with automated tools (such as class kerning), but leaving plenty of room for manual skills and visual sensibility to breathe. The alphabet certainly helps, in the way that its letters resist regimentation, as evidenced by those which don’t comfortably pigeon-hole into kerning classes. 

<em>…A classic "glass almost empty" statement.…</em>

<em>The point of the tool is to provide a way to automate kerning so that it might be integrated into the design process of some typefaces.</em>

Not so. It conceives of kerning as polishing that may be applied to any typeface after it has been designed.

Ha ha, well you clearly have standards of skyscraper proportions. So what was the spacing strategy with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/softmachine/|Softmachine]]? Now there's a glass overflowing to a flood. Was that 'proximity', 'stroke regularity', 'center of gravity', or a combi job? ;)</div>

Always nice to see examples with all the talk. Anchors for the discussion, otherwise it's just jargon. (Look it up. Esp. the etymology. I've always liked chickadees, you?)

I was being sarcastic :) Good kerning obviously requires high standards, skill, and a lot of work. But the high standards some designers preach down to others are often far from the standards they deliver themselves ;p  Also, i never see the point of individuals just lamely dissing tools or practices they have no interest in ever using. Experimentation, trying things out, making mistakes, crossing borders, are all valuable exercises (for those who do it, and more so for those who may eventually benefit from it). Conversely, trotting about on some high horse is rarely good exercise.  Auto-tools can be very usefull and creative parts of a design process, so new tools and new methods of automation should allways be encouraged and criticised positively. -v</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick: ‘<em>[…] rather than relying on my conditioning.</em>’

You will always rely on your conditioning, I reckon, because everything we do with type is relative to models which we learned to interpret. As David Kindersley stated in <em>Optical letter spacing</em> (London, 1976 | p.35): ‘<em>It is a commonplace that we see only what we know […]</em>’.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Elasmosaurus_Cope_Typophile_3593.jpg]

In the nineteenth century the palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope reconstructed an Elasmosaurus and he erroneously placed the head on the tail (see illustration above). The tail turned out to be shorter than the neck and obviously for Cope this was an unexpected proportional relationship of the two body parts. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral of Cope’s mistake is that the power of the human eye is purely relative to the anatomy of the things perceived. In <em>Art and Illusion</em> (Oxford, 1987 | p.255) Gombrich notes on this phenomenon: ‘<em>The stimulus patterns on the retina are not alone in determining our picture of the visual world. Its messages are modiﬁed by what we know about the “real” shape of objects.</em>’ 

Nick: ‘<em>You are the one doing the mystifying, hypothesizing a secret knowledge of the ancients.</em>’

My measurements of Renaissance type and matrices and actual casting provide so far ample proof for my hypotheses. If you don’t (want to) believe in this scientiﬁc method, then you can throw away the majority of books on art history, architecture, paleontology, archeology, et cetera, because most knowledge presented is the result of reconstructions. Also the technical descriptions on the working methods of the early Renaissance punch cutters as described so far, are merely based on nothing more than assumptions and projections of the scarce seventeenth- and eighteenth-century treatises, like Moxon’s and Fournier’s. 

Charles: ‘<em>I haven’t seen any good examples yet.</em>’

Shortly I will purchase one of Nick’s fonts, probably <em>Pratt Pro</em>, and I will objectively test whether artiﬁally spacing and kerning generated in a couple of nanoseconds can compete with his manual, intuitive operation, which is performed deep within a zone where the designer communes with the spatiality of the typeface. I will use <em>Kernus/KernMaster</em> for this, and also my own method based on ‘cadence-units’, which I brieﬂy described <a href="http://www.lettermodel.org/wordpress/?p=316">here</a>. Sometime coming week I will publish the results, if Nick agrees.

Vernon: ‘<em>Auto-tools can be very usefull and creative parts of a design process […]</em>’

I strongly believe that most of the type design process can be automatized/parametrized. If one can describe the matter, it can be programmed –that is, if enough resources are available.

I wouldn’t say my opposition to auto kerning is lame.
I’ve argued against it many times on Typophile, especially against Adobe’s “optical kerning” in InDesign.
This is a forum and I’m critiquing in a reasoned manner, not merely dissing.
Perhaps the criticism will lead to a better product.
But the only way of telling is by seeing the results.
If someone is going to launch a new product half-cocked, with samples of what it does, rather than focusing on how it works and letting people try it, they must expect criticism based on the samples.

I recall when Apple started out, the typesetting trade dissed the new technology for its poor quality.
Fair enough, and the quality improved.

But not every new thang obsolesces the dinosuars.
Remember Multiple Masters?
The world was not ready for that much parametrics then.

I wouldn’t go so far as to say auto-kerning will never produce as good results as manual kerning.
And I don’t believe that auto-kerning is entirely non-manual, or vice versa.

But TypeFacet is presently wishful thinking.

Frank, thanks for the kind offer.
No need to purchase, I’ll send you the font.

It will not come as a surprise when I totally disagree with this statement. Kerning is a reﬁnement of the spacing and the spacing comes forth from / is part of the design. 

Every type design has an optimal spacing, which –if the design has been made properly– results in an even stem-interval combined with uniform spaces between and within the letterforms. If the type design was originally made for text purposes, the spacing can be made somewhat more compact for display purposes, but this will hamper the stem-interval a bit (when one looks at Renaissance type, then for instance in Garamont’s <em>Parangon Romain</em> the serifs seem to be longer than in the French Master’s <em>Gros Canon Romain</em>, so the serifs probably were used as wedges [and as indicators for the casters for the setting of the ﬁxed mould-registers], and their lengths were relative to the ‘point size’).

Taking into account that kerning is relative to the design, I expect that the output by <em>Kernus/KernMaster</em> will not differ too much from your ‘manual’ kerning. Of course, there can be some discussion about how tight one kerns combinations like ‘Ty’, and perhaps also about the kerning of some punctuation marks, but I expect that overall the results of both approaches will be quite similar.

At the TypoTechnica 2007 conference in Frankfurt Miguel Sousa and I compared the kerning of <em>Hypatia</em> with the one that was generated on the ﬂy by <em>KernMaster</em>. Miguel was impressed by the fact that the artiﬁcial kerning-values came quite close to the ones he generated. (This reminds me of the nice duo-presentation we gave at the ATypI conference in Brighton in 2008, in which we compared the <em>FontLab Studio</em> / <em>AFDKO</em> based workﬂow at Adobe with the <em>FontMaster</em> based workﬂow at DTL –but that is another story).

Yes, you are right: I forgot to mention the inﬂuence of the inferior conjunction of the moon at a certain moment during the creation of type, the humidity in general and in the working space of the type designer in particular, and the undeﬁnable relation between Voodoo and type design. But for the rest I was spot-on, I reckon.

Nick: ‘<em>I would like to see a comparison of your auto-kerning for two of my “manually kerned” types—Scotch Modern and Richler […]</em>’

Basically I would like to go further than kerning alone additional to your spacing, by also applying auto-spacing on another example. It is in my opinion more interesting to use a ‘translation’ and an ‘expansion’ typeface from your œuvre. The two typefaces you mention are basically from the latter category. Shall we say that we both select one?

They do both have vertical stress, but their spacing strategies are quite different, which is why I thought they’d both be interesting to compare with automated kerning.

Scotch Modern
Richler
Goodchild

For a “translation” face, might I recommend my Jenson (Goodchild)?
There are other Jensons to compare it with (and even perhaps Goudy’s Italian Oldstyle), which might be revealing.
Bitstream’s DeVinne would be good to compare with Scotch Modern, on account of the former’s interesting deployment of negative sidebearings on /v etc.</div>

Well, i've found Typefacet pretty handy this week, using it as a quick way to space the ufo files of a new face, 'on the fly', as i work on them in Robofont & Prepolator; tweak, shape, autospace, look .... tweak & shape more, autospace again... etc. Ok so it's probably a forgiving face for an autospacer, but i have been impressed by the spacing Typefacet gives (see below).

I can throw a whole ufo at Typefacet and it will return workable spacing across all glyphs (unlike the autospacers in fontog, fontlab or fontforge). Also, equally balanced glyphs (e.g. 'o', 'A', 'H', 'M', etc) get equally balanced side bearings, and unequally balanced glyphs get the 'correct' ratio of side bearing values. Other autospacers aren't allways that sensible. It's not the final spacing, and i will manually adjust some values, but it's doing a pretty good job, and the optical values of 'the usual' kerning pairs look ready for kerning later (auto and/or manual).  I would say it's saving me lots of time and compensating for my usually not so great attention span for spacing ;)</div>

There are many arguments against this, but the one I will mention here is that, from an historiographical perspective, culture can be seen to evolve as a progressive dialectic between the tendencies of art and science, with whatever the one creates being questioned by the other. 

Art says: OK, science, technology and capitalism, you’ve standardized and commodiﬁed That, but we decline to use your tools as you intended—so suck on This!
And Science says: Shape up, you wayward Mess of biology and culture; we are on the threshold of discovering your hidden mechanism and Making It Work.

Play around, and let me know how it can be improved.
And maybe some of this can be integrated into TypeFacet Autokern (for example, the way you tweak and play the macro each time to get quick visual feedback).</div>

Would it make sense to make the sans/serif variable something more sophisticated than just zero or one?

BTW the best feature is of course the baby sounds! Let me guess: 2 months?

I think at the very least you'll need an intermediate value for flare serifs, and maybe a higher-than-normal value for slab serifs. But I don't know how your code is written to use that variable.
