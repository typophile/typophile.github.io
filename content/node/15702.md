  derive from the omission of the pilcrow.\r\n\r\nGill uses pilcrow in his <em>Essay
  on Typography</em> to signal paragraphs throughout the book, but sometimes he uses
  pilcrows in conjunction with the line break (thus pilcrow is always at the beginning
  of the line) and sometimes, Gill uses pilcrows without the line breaks i.e. wherever
  the paragraph happens to end in a given line.\r\n\r\nMy question would be: is there
  the difference between the two? Were line breaks practiced in scribal times? Any
  good resources on the evolution of pilcrow (other than the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow\">wiki
  article</a>)?"
