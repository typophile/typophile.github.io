  drafts and previous design ideas (that were no longer used in the final draft) for
  the projects in the portfolio? "

  body: It really depends on the interview. Some people only want to see pristine
    finished work. Some people assume that young designers don't just pull pristine
    finished work out of thin air and want to know how it came to be and who else
    helped. Do some research on the interviewers, make a process book, take a sketchbook,
    and be prepared to show what you think will work best.

  body: "Depends on the situation, but in general I wouldn't do it for every project
    in your portfolio, but if you wanted to show your thinking process for a few of
    your projects I think that would be fine. \r\n\r\nJust keep in mind in that interviewers
    are usually busy people and you want to quickly show them your best work, rather
    than a lot of ideas that didn't pan out. "

  body: 'Good thoughts, thank you. You are pinpointing my thought to not give too
    much unnecessary background, and only give enough when needed. '
