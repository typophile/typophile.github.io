    the top of the font list! Who can beat that!\r\n\r\nI think to elicit more than
    simply flip responses, you may have to refine your criteria. "

    example, I like FF Dax and similar fonts, but they are already seen everywhere.\r\n\r\nThanks

    you can draw them to work perfect in the given order."

    from the list I have, I can get some inspiration in some glyphs.\r\n\r\nWhat problems
    are you talking about? Is is just because of the loss of impact, or is there anything
    else?"

  body: I depends (like I said - most cases). If the logo consists of a pictorial
    part and a text part that are loosely connected, the logo may look odd when it
    has to stand close to text set in the same typeface. It depends on the kind of
    logo. Post a sample.

    the earlier and less on the latter process, but it depends.) You don't even need
