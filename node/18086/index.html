		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>There are some retailers out there. They will propably not purchase your designs but take it under contract. That means that they might wanna sell it exclusively for you for a limited periode of time. Depending on what you have to offer and if they like it, you might get a contract.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/">MyFonts</a> works non-exclusive and you can get your fonts out there as you please. They take only 35% fee, so you get to keep 65%! For as far as I know it this is the best deal out there.</p>
<p>I have a lot of my fonts at differtent retailers, but found it very hard to get in contact with them. So prepare yourself for hard work and disappointment. ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi. I held off replying, because it&rsquo;s tough to know what to say. Most publishers - myself included - like to work with designers to get their types ready for the world, and then do the marketing and whatnot, and hope that the marketplace wll respond. Type publishing is a huge gamble and the rewards range from zero to pretty good. Publishers share the risk and the reward with designers. Buyouts of type designs do happen, but usually it&rsquo;s designers/publishers selling to a client. You might find a publisher who will be interested in a buyout of your designs, but most will want to maintain a publisher/author relationship. That being said, you should definitely contact those foundries whose work you admire, and who you feel would admire your work. Then you can discuss the nitty-gritty business details.</div>

Maybe having your own site or a myfonts store would be a good first step. If your plan is to maximize revenue then building a reputation (making good stuff, attending &amp; speaking at the conferences, getting high-profile clients, entering a few compos, doing more techy work - such as clever OTL or hinting) and then doing custom work might be your best plan.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While it does take a small piece of time and thought to get the fonts ready for sale on Myfonts, there really is no ongoing promotion/marketing required from you. Myfonts already has the traffic flow in place to showcase your font to a greater capacity than you would ever be able to do yourself.
In regard to waiting for payment, well, as others have said, you really can not expect up front payments without a track record, and I personally dont see any hardship in the 30+ days waiting period for royalties to be forwarded to you.</div>

It seems there is no chance to direct sell.
<strong>Designers what extra do,Who has a track record?.Something from out of tec. spec.!!!!!What the different they do.</strong>
If i am running a type foundary,i will look for technically ok,well hinted,well kerned,features working well,and above all design has something appealing,which can attract to buyers.They don&rsquo;t look who is designer.A wellknown or unknown both can create good designs.There maybe one difference due to lack of experience&quot;technical&quot;.</div>

But more typographic designs - such as &ldquo;Gotham&rdquo; or &ldquo;Farnham&rdquo;, to pick two recent typefaces at random - really demonstrate the skills their designers have, as well as their æsthetic sense.</div>

<p>a. A constructed font doesn&rsquo;t really demonstrate any of the typical type design skills. It does look like a typical beginner&rsquo;s effort. Nothing wrong with that, but if this is typical of what you&rsquo;re currently producing then you have a ways to go before you can expect any kind of commercial success.</p>
<p>b. It shows a lack of understanding of what outfits like Adobe (the subject of your initial inquiry) are interested in - compare with Bickham Script Pro, or Garamond Premier Pro.</p>
