body: I just have a general question about those of you using FontLab. Do you think
  its okay to let FontLab add points to your glyphs? Does that help when hinting the
  font, or is there a general rule that the least amount of points possible in a glyph
  is the way to go? Are fonts with the least amount of points considered better drawn?

    of the automated, traced, trashed stuff around, the automated optimize will help
    to fight the beast.\r\n\r\nIn general a glyph with a fewer amount of points is
    mostly better than the \"same\" outline with more points. Type1 Hinting needs
    points on extremes to be \"assigned\". Please study well designed & technical
    well developed types like Myriad Pro. Its shipped with the free Adobe Reader.
    Look & See!\r\n\r\nIn some cases a rough calligraphic touch is needed. In this
    situation you have to break some rules.\r\n\r\nFor dingbats and ornament fonts
    you should hardly try to stay below 1000 points per gylph. Its not a technical
    limit, but a speed and screen rendering quality issue.\r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\"

  body: I've actually checked out the outlines of fonts like Frutiger and The Mix.
    When imported into FontLab, Font Audit shows that there may be hinting problems
    with certain glyphs...but they're both well-drawn fonts! Thanks for the input.
