    here, like register receipts (oh and by the way IRS auditor I have these) and
    others. I seem to remember a driver''s license a couple of years ago... '

  body: "I never thought of this. Please let me explain.\r\n\r\nI own an original
    NYC Checker Taxi from 1981.  I am trying to recreate a license for the vehicle.
    \ The license in the photo is from 1997.  The current NYC taxi licenses are completely
    different.\r\n\r\nIf I was trying to \"hid\" the fact that I am creating something
    illegal, would I post the entire pictures.  I would have just put a word or two
    up for identification.\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of the car I am trying to create
    it for:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nw2wxooupfpide5/NYC7A70.JPG\r\n\r\nI hope
    this clears things up.  I can see how you would think what you originally thought.\r\n\r\n"

    his sample.\r\n\r\nCarbon Bold was pretty close for the name, not so close for
    the numbers:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/carbon/bold/\r\n\r\nScreener
    is great for the name, closer for the numbers:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/screener/\r\n\r\nThe
    labels appear to be Helvetica Bold."

    Helvetica, no. Arial, which should be on your system, may do okay."

  body: Sorry for the initial mix-up. I hope you do understand how we could have thought
    you were up to something sneaky. The car by the way is beautiful and I can certainly
    see why you would want to bring it back to as close to original or period as possible!

  body: "I think that the square/angular lettering on the license wasn't printed using
    \"type\" - not by a phototypesetter, and not by hot lead or wood type.\r\n\r\nLetters
    like that, designed so they could be printed in different sizes, because their
    fundamental elements were square blocks and the triangles that result from cutting
    a square in half, were programmed into some dot-matrix printers intended to print
    labels and bar codes and stuff like that. For example, Centronics made some like
    that.\r\n\r\nBut it might also be noted that even though your intent is innocent
    vehicle restoration, and the taxi licenses in question, being of an obsolete format,
    couldn't \"fool anyone\" in the sense of allowing an unlicensed taxi to operate,
    it's still possible that the licenses could be protected under laws intended to
    prevent the counterfeiting of official documents. These laws usually tend to be
    written broadly - thus, we hear of the Treasury Department seizing coffee mugs
    because they ran afoul of regulations restricting the pictorial portrayal of money,
    even though the mugs could not actually be passed as counterfeits."
