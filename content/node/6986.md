body: Hi everyone, I am a graphic design student and for part of my assignment I need
  to explain the terms uppercase and lower case and their origins. If anyone knows
  of a good resource site I can research I would be delighted. So far I have run web
  searches but I can never seem to find any relevant information. Your help would
  be much appreciated.

    the lead type for minuscules in the bottom drawer, IIRC. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: i am not very sure about this, but afaik, these  <BR>terms come from the old
    type &#34;cases&#34;. <BR> <BR>when using metal type, each character is  <BR>constructed
    as a little piece of... metal. to  <BR>organize these pieces, typesetters use
    a wooden  <BR>box, divided in several &#34;cases&#34;, each case  <BR>corresponding
    to a specific character. <BR> <BR>the uppercase characters are saved in the upper  <BR>cases
    of the box, and the lowercase in the lower  <BR>cases. simple as that. <BR> <BR>i

  body: Paul would be right about this. Early on, the majuscule was kept in one case
    &#40;drawer&#41;, the minuscule in another. But at the top of the cabinet &#40;of
    drawers&#41; were a set of slanted banks. This is where the compositor would put
    the cases when setting type. The top one was for the majuscule &#40;uppercase&#41;
    and the bottom for the minuscule &#40;lowercase&#41;. Later on, combinations such
    as the California job case or the Yanbkee job case incorporated both the majuscule
    and minuscule into one case. <BR> <BR>But the case itself is divided into sorts.
    The phrase &#34;out of sorts&#34; is said by some to derive from the situation
    of running out of a particular character. Sorts are also know as additional runs
    of a certain character. You might order, for instance, a six-inch line of lowercase
    e sorts to replensish your stock.

  body: Gerald, of course, knows well of which he speaks.  <BR> <BR>If you would like
    a visual and/or documentation to back you up, get ahold of a copy of <i>A Short
    History of the Printed Word</i> by Warren Chappell. There is an illustration and
    a concise description of the cases in Chapter III &#40;pp. 52-53 in the first
    edition&#41;.  <BR> <BR>You should be able to find a copy at any decent library.
    <BR> <BR>This book was also recently reprinted and updated, published by Hartley
    &amp; Marks, with the additions provided by Robert Bringhurst, if I recall correctly.
    I presume that they reproduced the original illustrations. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>

  body: Another good book that I&#39;ve found somewhat helpful <BR> is <i> The Art
    of Hand Lettering</i> by Helm Wotzkow. The hand  <BR>lettering part isn&#39;t
    too relevant these days, but it <BR> covers the basics of good spacing, proportion,
    etc. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s relatively easy to find at used book  shops and  <BR>it&#39;s
    usually under $5.
