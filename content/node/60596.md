  body: "I found a site talking about [[http://www.fontspace.com/category/Highway+Gothic|Highway
    Gothic fonts]], and the second one shown looks like a condensed version of the
    one in your first sample. The top one is the one used a lot in the US, which has
    been imitated with Interstate (Font Bureau) and Blue Highway (Larabie Fonts/Typodermic).\r\n\r\nThe
    wiki symbol next to your second sample keeps it from opening an image.\r\n\r\n-
