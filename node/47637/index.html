  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I know this isn't quite the right forum. But here, I get answers . . .

We're about to change from CS2 to CS3. One issue is the year's worth of books we've already set using CS2. Sure as shooting, in the coming years, about 15% of them will be reprinted with a few slight changes, or become second editions with more extensive changes. The problem with all this is you can never quite tell just what will "disturb the wax" & cause InDesign to recompose, and the recomposition causes problems.

All our books are set with an extensive user exception dictionary. For some reason, I can't seem to bring it into ID3 as a UDC and make it work properly, even though the panels show all should be well. CS3 doesn't seem to honor the exceptions unless the dictionary is embedded in the document, and then other problems arise.

All screen shots are from CS3. The first screen shot is the Edit > Preferences > Dictionary. To me, it looks as it should; namely, just like with CS2. As evidence, the second screen shot of Edit > Spelling > Dictionary shows the hyphenation exceptions we added. For instance, notice that "especially" has been added, and is now "espe~~~cially" (BTW, "others" is now "~others", but of course, is farther down). 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pref_5899.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/dict-1_5803.gif]

In the text sample below, the first instance of the paragraph is how it set in CS2, and how it remains if you just bring it into CS3. But a recompose (control+alt+slash) results the second instance, obviously not honoring the hyphenation in the UDC (English USA is a part of the paragraph style, BTW).
  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/texcomp_4732.gif]

The only way to get it back to the original hyphenation is to merge the dictionary into the document & use a blank UDC, but then a recompose generates some different line & page breaks, actually increasing the page count of the book by 1 page, even though there are  no changes to the text. Not acceptable.

We don't want to have to keep a copy of each release of InDesign around just to handle reprints & second editions. What am I doing wrong?

		<div class="commentbody">Eric,

Yes, surely. I too don't want Typophile *build* to become an adjunct ID Tech support. I searched the usual InDesign places and found nothing on this matter. So my excuse is that some of the people who participate in building OT fonts are among the most savvy I know, and I can't figure out what, if anything, I'm doing wrong.</div>
