  went to school for it. I am now working as a tech and tutoring in ID, ILL & PS CS5.\r\n\r\nMy
  education taught me there are bad ways to use layout programs so I want to make
  sure the students I tutor can benefit from learning good habits as opposed to just
  taking the easy way out by letting the app decide how things should look. \r\n\r\nRight
  now, specifically, I am talking about column justification. Many of the classes
  (which are not graphic design but intro/overview classes) are having students duplicate
  layouts--which is fine--but since they aren\u2019t teaching the software, the students
  will do things like use paragraph returns to justify, (to ensure each line ends
  with the specific word that match the layout document). They also misuse tracking/kerning/leading
  etc., much less know the differences or when/where/how to use them.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
  impossible to just teach the program without going into some design aspects and
  would like to educate these students a bit about what makes good typographic sense.
  How it\u2019s about type working with white space to create texture, and the difference
  between optical and measured spaces. \r\n\r\nI haven\u2019t done a lot of layout
  work myself and have yet to get a handle on the best way to properly finesse justifying
  a lot of text in columns but I know simply clicking on \u2018justified\u2019 in
  the paragraph palette makes for poor design.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sure there are a number
  of ways to do this properly but I\u2019ve yet to feel comfortable giving any hardcore
  advice and wonder if anyone would care to share their conventions here? \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  a million!"

  body: "> [my classes] are not graphic design but intro/overview classes\r\n\r\nThe
    three discussions mentioned have a lot of excellent advice. But if you're teaching
    beginners, I'd suggest just giving them a few basic tips, rather than trying to
    make them into justification experts.\r\n\r\nShow them some \"before/after\" examples
    of good and bad hyphenation.  Explain how line length affects hyphenation. Show
    how to turn hyphenation on and off, and explain a few of the basic settings. Point
    out that the Help files for each program explain the other settings if they want
    to refine the hyphenation further. And show them the right way to manually insert
    line breaks.\r\n\r\nBy the way, one mistake I've frequently noticed in beginning
    designers is that they insert hard line breaks when manually changing line breaks.
    This is bad technique, as they are actually creating a new paragraph when they
    do that. They should use soft breaks instead (shift-return in InDesign).\r\n\r\nHere
    are a few other goofs I often see. They'll force a line break by inserting a tab
    or multiple blank spaces, which can cause problems if the text reflows later.
    And this may be slightly off topic, but many beginners don't know how to use the
    \"indent to here\" command in InDesign; a command that's extremely useful in many
    situations. "

    see a number of things I'd like to try.\r\n\r\nJames,\r\n\r\nThank you for some
    great advice!\r\n\r\nIn having to troubleshoot students files I show them how
    to turn on/off hidden characters so they can check for inconsistencies when the
    text layout behaves erratically.\r\n\r\nRe: \"...I'd suggest just giving them
    a few basic tips, rather than trying to make them into justification experts.\"\r\n\r\nI
    agree--especially when I'm not 100% comfortable with it myself! Many classes will
    use the same exercises and one part of these layouts is justified columns that
    students seem to slave over, so no, I'd rather not spend too much time on any
    one topic but this seems to be a dominant problem for most of them. If they're
    not planning on being the next Paul Rand I don't go into as much detail but for
    those with a keen interest it's hard not to try to make the experience a richer
    one and eliminate the same frustrating mistakes I made when trying to be creative
    with an app I didn't know.\r\n\r\nShowing examples of line length and badly spaced
    text is a great idea. In fact, example from the real world abound and I should
    be looking for them to use as teaching materials.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nwmuench"

  body: James, in fact you don't need use soft line break in InDesign to force a line
    to end. You have commands to force the hyphenation of a word in the place you
    want, or to not break the word instead. This way is better because if the column
    width changes, the line won't break in the wrong place as if you use soft breaks...

  body: "Carlos, you make a good point; a soft break will not reflow later. InDesign
    gives us a variety of options for forcing a line break at a specific place, and
    each has its pros and cons.  \r\n\r\nA discretionary hyphen is a good choice if
    you don't mind having the last word hyphenated. Will only work if the last word
    is already hyphenated but you just want to change the location of the hyphen.
    Will reflow properly (if the text reflows later and the hyphen is no longer needed,
    the hyphen will disappear.)\r\n\r\nIf you don't want a hyphen, options include:\r\n\r\nDiscretionary
    Break \u2014 Tells InDesign the preferred spot to break a line. Will reflow if
    necessary. However InDesign will only apply the break if it's near the end of
    a line, and I've found that InDesign sometimes refuses to break where I want it
    to because it thinks I'm making that line too short.\r\n\r\nSoft Break \u2014\_Forces
    a break at a specific spot. Gives the user total control over the break point,
    but may cause problems if the text reflows later.\r\n\r\nNo Break \u2014 Tells
    InDesign not to break a word or phrase. Often used for phone numbers, URLs, etc.,
    but can also be used to force breaks at certain points. But if the text reflows
    later it's possible you'll be left with an awkward break."

  body: "Discretionary hyphen will work to force a break if you place it at the beginning
    of a word, before the first letter.\r\n\r\nBut if one wants this kind of micro
    control over paragraphs and over each line, then it\u2019s probably better to
    use the single-line composer, instead of the paragraph composer. That way, micro
    tweaks like those mentioned will do exactly what is expected, as opposed to causing
    the justification engine to recalculate the entire paragraph, which will often
    then come up with a different solution than the one intended by the compositor.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It sounds like a lot of the justification issues that you are having are
    due to the types of breaks that the students are using. I would suggest teaching
    them the proper use of breaks that James mentioned above. To improve the look
    of the justification, make sure you teach them to use their justification settings
    for a paragraph style (Mac [CMD-SHIFT-OPT-J] win [CTRL-SHIFT-OPT-J). Ugly hyphenation
    can also ruin a block of copy, so consider the hyphenation settings also. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/justification_3498.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/hyphenation_5703.png]\r\nKeep
    in mind that I am just a student myself, so you can probably get more advanced
    or specific advice from some of the other members here."

  body: "I'll reiterate something I said in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/79598#comment-454162\">another
    thread</a> on H&J: In InDesign, the more you limit the variables, the fewer options
    the engine has to work with, and the more likely you are to wind up with situations
    where the engine has to \u201Cgive up\u201D and opt for bad results.\r\n\r\nSo,
    if you really can\u2019t abide hyphenated lines in proximity to one another, then
    sure, go ahead and set the Hyphen Limit to 1 as in this example. But hyphenation
    and spacing are always playing against each other; the more you tie the engine\u2019s
    hands in hyphenation, the more it\u2019s going to have to compromise in spacing,
    and vice versa.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll tell you, I regularly work with an unlimited
    Hyphen Limit in InDesign and I rarely see more than three hyphens in a row, and
    even three is not that common. (In book work, that is; narrow columns will require
    more frequent hyphens.) The H&J engine really tries not to stack hyphens and factors
    in penalties accordingly. \r\n\r\nAgain, picking on the example above (nothing
    personal, Mike): If you limit the hyphenation in this case to words with minimum
    7+ letters, then the engine will not be allowed to break words like \u201Ctim-ber,\u201D
    \u201Cvic-tim,\u201D \u201Czig-zag,\u201D et cetera. (There are probably thousands
    of examples.) \r\n\r\nIf you really can\u2019t stand these sorts of breaks, then
    by all means, set that limit. But otherwise, why not give it as much leeway to
    make good choices as it can get?\r\n\r\nYou should really only limit it with what
    you absolutely cannot abide."
