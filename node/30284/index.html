<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I have reason to believe the <a href=http://typophile.com/user/103/contact>contact page</a> on each user's profile is inoperable -- at least mine was. I was not receiving any emails sent through the form. So I've disabled mine. All those who have sent messages to me through this page, please forgive my lack of response and <a href=http://typophile.com/user/103>email me directly</a>.
Anyone else tested this page on their profile?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>i believe that this has been disabled as many users were receiving spam that was coming though typophile. let me see if i can find the official statement...</div>

<div class=commentbody>There is no indication that it is disabled on each user's contact page. It allows anyone to enter a message and hit "send e-mail" as if something was actually sent. I shudder to think how many messages I've missed over the last 2 years -- or how many have missed mine.</div>

<div class=commentbody>At least for me, the site has been inaccessible sporadically from yesterday morning. Sometimes, a huge "ACCESS DENIED" sign would appear when I tried to go into a forum.
Any ideas?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just received an email message that was sent on Dec. 29! Perhaps a fix is in?
Bram - That is a separate issue and from what I can tell only a temporary hiccup.
Also, just to clarify, the Typophile Instant Messenger (at the bottom of every page) works fine. It's the Contact page, accessible from any user's profile page, that I'm referring to.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is somewhat off-topic, but I thought I could pop up here and make a small request:
I keep getting an <strong>Access Denied</strong> message when I use my plain ol' bookmarked browser link to go to the main "forums" page of the site. I am able to go to the index page of typophile.com, and from there I can select one of the featured threads (which is how I got here), and my name is showing up in the "new comment" area which means I must be logged in, but then if I go up to the top of the page and choose "forums" I get the same message.
I'm running OS10.3.9 and Firefox. Can anyone suggest to me what I should do to remedy this? (I'm assuming it's on my side and not the server side.) And please if anyone has a suggestion please email to me at bruce@brucekennettstudio.com . . . since I can't get to the regular menu of forums!
Thanks,
Bruce
(I feel as if I'm writing a message in a bottle and hurling it out into the surf!)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Weird,
In my case, the contact page worked fine. The IM feature as well.
If it was a hiccup in the system, I guess the best suggestion is to wait for a little bit.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, it's not Firefox. I just launched Safari, and had to log in anew from that browser, and although I at first had the menu of forums available, once I went to this thread I was unable to go up to the top to select forums. I guess I'll just quit and listen to some music, and maybe tomorrow something will be different.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This morning the contact pages seem to be fine...
Just another temporary hiccup.
Meanwhile, ACCESS DENIED - I've had it happen twice now. The first time I logged out - and it wouldn't accept my password or name after that.
Reached myself through a different computer and the first computer was fine after that.
Then it happened again - and I just switched to yahoo.com and came back - and it was fine.
Maybe it will be gone forever soon....</div>
