  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Good day.  Here is a logo for my own business that I woul like to be critiqued.  I'm starting up some freelance work since I've just finnished school and I need an identity.  I choose Metric Design, since I am a canadian living in the US and the name suggests a different way of looking at things.  I basically settled on a geometric shape(s) in the form of an &quot;M&quot; and simple text for the logo (eurostile).  Here it is on what I would like to be my business card.  Its fairly narrow of a card, 4cmx9cm.  It is all pantone metallic silver ink, because I want it to look like a ruler.  There is a diecut circle like most aluminium rulers have (which I will be doing myslelf after print, with a simple handheld holepunch), and on the back is an actual ruler in centimeters with a small conversion chart for cm to inch. <BR>I want it printed on a very heavy stock paper.  What do you think?  I would love coments and critisisms.  Thankyou. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/37729.jpg" alt="Metric Business Card"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I just wingin it here, <BR>Your identity seems like it is on the right track but I do have a few suggestions. Take em' or leave em'. First, I feel that the 3 dementional logo doesn't relate to the ruler idea which you are presenting on the back of the card. When I think of metric I think of the centimeter(singular) which you have used as a graphic element on the back. I don't think of three dementional space as much. Basically what I am trying to say is that there might be to many things going on on this card. I wish there was a way to integrate the centimeter scale idea with the logo. You know.. it's early in the morning so if I am not making any sense I am terribly sorry. Oh! have you tried just using 1 centemeter unit for the logo. The lines of the centemeter kind of look like an M for metic. Anyway I hope some of that makes sense.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike: <BR> <BR>Coincedentally, I just designed a business card with a hole punch also. Even more interesting, is that I recently designed a stationary suite with a ruler edge also. Something I found on my job, was that the ruler edge looked a lot nicer when it was not bold, but on mine the measurements were intended to be more subtle. That may not be the case for yours. <BR> <BR>RE: &quot;</div>

The best thing to remember when going for that sheen is to flood large areas with the metallic ink, which you are doing here. <BR> <BR>BTW, I like  your sphere logo.

You might want to try and connect the top of the logo with a solid line or as Hrant said extend the two end lines to create more of an m. If you put a lid on the top, however you might find that you will not need to adjust the end lines to fix the legibility issue. Check out the MIT logo for a little inspiration.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Dan, If you don't literally make small rulers out of metal the concept will seem almost incomplete. Try what Dan said about placing the metric m in silver on a white background. You might find that the flexiblity of your identity will instantly change. If you are still married to metalic inks you could coat the back of the card with solid silver. You would still be implying the ruler surface and without getting into overkill land. Raise this question to yourself. Are you trying to develop a ruler or a buisness card? They both serve two completely different functions.</div>

Your later attempts to make the ruler look too much like a stand alone m get to far from the original idea. <BR> <BR>As for printing, if you want a silver background, consider printing black on a silver paper. Chances are your production run is pretty small so using an expensive paper might be cheaper/better than two inks, or a double hit of silver etc. <BR> <BR>Finally, the font. I vote an emphatic no on eurostile. It looks old and tired.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you everyone for your comments.  I'm fairly set on the metallic pantone 877 U for my background. White is an option, but there are so many white cards out there. The company I'm currently interning at (<a href="http://www.etcstudios.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.etcstudios.com">www.etcstudios.com</a></a>) has ran several cards, silver on matte and I just adore them. Aluminum would be awsome Mica, I sent for an estimate from Luste Cal, thanks. We'll see how that goes. Allthough as a designer specializing in print, a nice paper quality would probably be the way to go. I really like the ruler, and Darrel I like you're idea of not running the ticks all the way to the edge.  Anyway, the logo is still bothering me&hellip;I'll be playing around for a while and will post results.</div>
