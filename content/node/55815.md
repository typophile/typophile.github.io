body: Hi, I apologize if this isn't the right forum, I'm new!  I am wondering how
  to increase the height of a font, without increasing the width and without ruining
  its aesthetic by having it look stretched and distorted.  Are there any tricks to
  do this.  Thanks!

    that.  Alternatively, if you have a condensed face, just make that larger, or
    maybe a condensed light face.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina

    font and use Font Remix Tools to do it.

    the aesthetic of a font quite deeply by making it narrower (which is a better
    way to think about it than \"taller\").\r\n\r\nAnyway, if quality is important,
    you have to do it by hand.\r\nMore: http://typophile.com/node/42930\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Thanks everyone for the replies.  I am new here - are there professional typographers
    on these forums who can help with this type of work?!  Actually, it's not an entire
    font.  I have a wordmark with 5 letters, that I really like at certain sizes,
    but I think it's too expanded or something, because the lettering is too small
    when the mark is 100px wide.  Most wordmarks are a decent size at 100px wide,
    but this one is just far too small, so I think the lettering needs to be narrowed,
    but I don't want to lose the look it has right now.

    to help with this.  If this is the wrong forum for this request, please let me
    know.  I need the height of these letters set to 100px, without changing the width
    of the letters.  \r\n\r\nhttp://i39.tinypic.com/9jlyj8.jpg\r\n\r\nAlso, I only
    have an image file of the lettering, would it be easy to put these letters in
    a truetype font file?!\r\n\r\nThanks!"
