  body: Despite glaring similarities, can one accuse Myriad of being just a copy of
    Frutiger? Is Times Roman only a copy of Plantin, Sabon of Garamond? Type design
    is evolutionary, there are very few true originals. One might even consider Myriad
    an improvement on Frutiger with its true italics (linotype came out with true
    italics after Myriad), many widths and weights.

  body: "It's very convenient to your contention that we are looking at type rendered
    *on-screen*. It's a contrived \"test\" which indicates side bearing settings and
    spacing in linear text fonts are part of letter / glyph design. If you render
    these three fonts of similar letter / glyph design at the small sizes shown here
    on-screen at the pitiful resolution of 100 dots per inch, all three fonts appear
    to have the same spacing.\r\n\r\nThis does not prove the designers of Myriad and
    Mentone copied their spacing / side bering settings from Frutiger. It shows that
    linear text fonts of similar design require very similar spacing to be readable
    on-screen at small sizes, and shows that all competent type designers come to
    the same inevitable, unavoidable conclusions.\r\n\r\nIn print these fonts will
    render rather differently. You present a very selective visual argument, in effect
    a loaded, unfair, self-fulfilling falsehood.\r\n\r\nLet's see a comparison of
    Frutiger with two other linear text fonts. Then another comparison of two more
    other linear text fonts. Say --- Frutiger versus Helvetica versus Futura. What
    about Frutiger versus Museo? You might be alarmed at how close your own spacing
    values are to most other linear text fonts *on-screen at this deceptive size*.\r\n\r\nj
