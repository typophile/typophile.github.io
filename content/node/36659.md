  of indian folklore and am looking for a simple book type font (preferably serif)
  that would imply hindi/indian influence while still being readable and not kitschy.
  The text is for a small hardback and contains no images, though I haven't decided
  on my exact proportions yet. I'm new to book-formatting and design in general and
  would greatly appreciate any suggestions or tips you could give me. Thanks in advance
  and sorry if I screwed up any forum protocols."

  body: Unless you're stretching the wprd "children" to mean teenagers, I think the
    question above should be pause for you. A children's book needs to be illustrated.
    Unless you're doing it for yourself to read aloud and no child will ever be expected
    to pick up the book. If you're plan includes publication for sale, get thee to
    an illustrator. By the way, how many pages is this book--you know that 32 pages
    total for the books interior is the typical children's book, yes? (Again, young
    kids, that is.)

    feeling is that if the book is all text, with no images, then you should set the
    body copy in a legible roman face, and leave the hindi-influenced type for titles,
    headers, folios, etc."
