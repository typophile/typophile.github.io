  would have been fine but the 'S' has been really lazily executed, so I refuse to
  use it as it would bug the hell out of me. Any suggestions would be welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks! "

  body: The original was called Baby Fat and was designed by Milton Glaser. I'm not
    sure exactly what year, but I think it was around 1970. There were several variations
    of the shading. Photo-Lettering carried it and credited Glaser. Buxom was probably
    an unauthorized film font version. The pages on MyFonts for Buxom all credit "FotoStar".
