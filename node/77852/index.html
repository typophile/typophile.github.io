<p>I thought I&rsquo;d just point you to this incredible offer on [[http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/URW-TypeWorks-3000-fonts-with-reference-book_W0QQitemZ200561695551QQcategoryZ171QQcmdZViewItemQQ_trksidZp4340.m263QQ_trkparmsZalgo%3DDLSL%252BSIC%26its%3DI%26itu%3DUCI%252BIA%252BUA%252BFICS%252BUFI%252BDDSIC%26otn%3D8%26pmod%3D200537138905%252B200537138905%26po%3D%26ps%3D63%26clkid%3D6219504482821084856|Ebay]] (great britain). URW Typeworks 1 and 2 are offered for just 30 GBP apiece, which is a real bargain. I guess you might become sceptic as these used to cost thousands in the early 90s, but I can only say that it&rsquo;s absolutely A OK. They are liquidated stock, are new and unopened, and the CDs are still sealed. Both PC and MAC, postscript and truetype are available. I work on MAC and it works with no problems whatsoever, and the fonts (500 fonts + modifications per set) are high quality, and they come with a useful 1000 page reference book with all fonts displayed.</p>
<p>Highly recommended I would say! I wouldn&rsquo;t be trying to sell you something if it wasn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>enjoy! :-)</p>

<p>Many here have advised to buy used copies of CorelDraw! to get the fonts embedded in it. This seems just as right, plus these are unused and sealed, so what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not going to start a discussion on piracy here. I know this has been and will be a sensitive theme around here, but I think the issue is far too complicated to simply say they pirated or not.</p>
<p>URW and Bitstream digitalized many fonts in the early digital era, often for other foundries without such expertise, like Berthold, Linotype, ITC etc. URW (which is not the same as URW++, read about this elsewhere) offered two price ranges, a cheaper one in which they acquired the right to resell, and a more expensive one, where this was not allowed or strongly limited (by name change for instance). This is how they acquired the rights to the fonts. This is not piracy, rather a smart business strategy. I&rsquo;ve read a lot about these cases, and this is much different from the likes of SSi, who had no right to resell, copied outlines and redistributed under another name, to bypass US copyright law. URW developed top quality font software in the seventies, the first and at the time best of its kind and many designers and foundries have used their expertise and software. The early digital type revolution has created a very dodgy mess, with a lot of bankrupties and mergers(Berthold for instance went bankrupt, URW later also went into receivership) and a lot of sharks in the water to pick up the pieces cheap and resell or redistribute themselves. This and the dodgy copyright laws for fonts makes verdicts very difficult to make. I would say the URW was on the right side of the spectrum, also because they were deeply involved in the beginnings of digital type and making it all happen, assuring a high quality standard. They were not in it for a quick buck IMHO.</p>
<p>@1996type
A lot of foundries offer the same fonts at the different prices, under different licenses and sometimes different names. But one cannot be called a pirate just for selling at a lower price&hellip;</p>

The issue is by no means far too complicated, it is very simple.
Theft of intellectual property is piracy!
Leo Meuffels for instance is still upset that URW++ stole his Hotel font (and renamed it Dextor). I don&rsquo;t care if URW++ uses a smart business strategy, if they were involved in the beginnings of digital type, if they developed top quality font software or whatever you say trying to rationalize their actions, theft is theft!</div>
