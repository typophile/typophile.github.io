body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bar_6179.jpg] \r\nThis picture is my all
  time favorite. I like the angle of this picture as well as the sign. I saw a bunch
  of these stacked vertical signs during my trip downtown, but this one was my favorite.
  Bars are definitely something most people associate to New Orleans. I like how beautiful
  this sign is even when it's not lit up, but because it's so pretty, it makes you
  want to see it working again. Remnants of the past, I suppose. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/obama_6151.jpg]\r\nI'm
  not sure if most people would consider this a sign, but I did. Someone has been
  posting these Obama posters all over the city. I posted this one because I thought
  it was pretty funny. I'm a big fan of handwritten text, especially when it looks
  like my own handwriting.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/old_4568.jpg]\r\nI
  almost missed this wall because the paint is so faded, but I'm glad I didn't because
  I think this is an awesome find. I am constantly on and around this street (I'm
  almost certain its Royal) and I have never seen this wall before. I can't make out
  all the words but I know it says \"PRINTING\" and \"LETTER\" and maybe once was
  a printing shop or something. But I love how New Orleans as well as myself has this
  appreciation for the old, and I hope things like this don't get covered up because
  this is what I feel like makes New Orleans, New Orleans.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/frenchmarket_5595.jpg]\r\nNothing
  says New Orleans like the tiled street names on the ground. I took quite a few since
  they are at almost every corner in the quarter, but I liked this one the best because
  it looked really old and is in a recognizable place.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/armstrong_4133.jpg]\r\nI
  took this picture including the \"Do Not Enter\" sign because growing up, my mom
  would always warn me not to go in there EVER especially at night because I without
  a doubt was going to get raped, mugged, and killed. It's safe to say, I've never
  been to Armstrong park, but it does have a really awesome sign. Each letter is lined
  with lights so at night it's quite a sight.\r\n\r\nI have more I'd like to post,
  or link to another page, but I'm already late for work so I'll try to do that later
  tonight."
