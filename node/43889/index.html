They're right. This would have been much better:

<div class=commentbody>Sigh... we used to have the best looking money in the world. Next to our original designs, foreign currencies tended to look like play money.
I was pretty upset when I got my new $5 altho am benumbed by previous redesigns as well.
I am also rather amused by the attempts to make life easier for the visually impaired. For example in my subway station there is a tiny little plaque with some braille on it, on one of many many columns on the platform. First of all, by the time you've made it into the station, thru the turnstile and onto the platform, the plaque is pretty useless, innit? Second of all, if you are blind, how in creation are you going to even find this silly little plaque on a random column. But I'm sure it's complying with some law, somewhere.</div>

<div class=commentbody>We could just give up on the worthless penny and stop at the nickel? The other option is to end the use of cash and have a totally electronic system. The street-corner musicians would hate that, as well as the guys in New York who try to sell knock-off Rollex watches out of a briefcase on the streets :-)

<div class=commentbody>Dwiggins' 1932 "Towards a Reform of the Paper Currency" is always worth a read on this topic and should be required reading for anyone having anything to do with currency design. The essay is sarcastic, hilarious (at times rather un-PC), but he makes some great points in addressing the problem<em> "It is not possible to discuss the designs [for the paper currency] without heat. They infuriate you because you cannot get at them. They are beyond the reach of criticism. They are safe—as an idiot is safe anywhere, in any community, savage or civilized. They are made immune by hideous deformity. . ."</em>
My attempts at reprinting the book were stalled with dead-ends in securing rights, but I thought an image of the cover might be appreciated:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dwiggins-currency-cover_5943.jpg]</div>

Nickels cost 10 cents to make.

This ends up happening anyway - people store pennies in jars, leave them lying on the street, etc.

<div class=commentbody>I am completely unimpressed by all the new US notes. Hideous.

Remember how people nobody needed to know about used to constantly blog about every aspect of their lives? Now they do it by constantly sending text messages to the twitter servers, so that everyone can know every detail of everyone else’s daily life as it happens, instead of waiting for it to get blogged every three hours. Then they all post comments about it on Facebook or Myspace or whatever…</div>

<div class=commentbody>Twitter is a microblog. Polls show that if people had to give up a web log or their Twitter, they would give up their blog. It's a bit like instant messaging in a non-linear format that people don't have to respond to.

Well, it keeps the Web 2.0 bubble going a little longer.
<cite>Polls show that if people had to give up a web log or their Twitter, they would give up their blog.</cite>
Maybe so, but I’m pretty sure a more useful poll would show that most people can’t really find any use for most of Web 2.0. Anyway, right now I’d much rather just give up the internet and sit under the cherry trees filing away at metal punches. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Your posting sure brought back memories -- my family, friends and I played "Life" all the time. We had the 1960 "Centennial" Edition (I think it was the Centennial of the Milton Bradley Co.) that featured Art Linkletter on the box, and on the $100,000 bill. I heard he was given the game's highest denomination as a "thank you" for endorsing the game. In that, he even beat out the company's Founder -- Milton Bradley, himself (who only got onto the $50,000 bill)! The others were all "made up" old-tyme folks: G. I. Luvmoney ($20K); Hesperia Mint ($10K); Cyrus Bonanza ($5K); Basil O. Cash ($1K); and Ransom A. Treasure ($500). I always liked Life money best of all, cause it looked more like real money. By comparison, Monopoly, Easy Money, Masterpiece, etc all had very fakey-looking currency! </div>

<div class=commentbody>Zara, the yellow dots are the [[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/geog/gessler/collections/steg-eurion-constellation.htm|EURion Constellation]] which feature on almost every bank note in current circulation. The idea is that when a colour photocopier senses 5 small yellow circles arranged in a pattern similar to the Orion Constellation, it will refuse to copy.
Interestingly, although they have been around for a while, no country has officially admitted their existence and so they have only recently been discovered. There is also some currency detection software built into more recent scanners and imaging software which is still [[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/projects/currency/|not understood]].

<div class=commentbody>Zara:
Apologies! I have only recently come across the EURion constellation and still find it interesting that such a thing exists and apparently existed on many bank notes for at least six years before detection. I expect the colour was chosen by which ever of the central European banks first came up with the idea as it does not stand out so much on the old DM and Franc notes (which I think were the first to use it). The most interesting concealment must, however, be on the old [[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/geog/gessler/collections/20-pound-eurion.jpg|£20]] British note.

It certainly is effective... when I mocked up the image that started this thread, Photoshop CS2 popped up a rather startling warning dialog. It let me do the edits and save, but apparently printing had been disabled. (I didn't try.)

<div class=commentbody>If it costs 2c to make a penny, and 10c to make a nickel, someone is ripping you off. There isn't that much more metal in the nickel, and the process is essential the same.
In Canada they have just started talking about getting rid of the penny (the govenment, I have been saying it for 20 years). Here we have $1 and $2 coins in circulation, not bills, so one's pocket is weighed down by all the coins. That is why Canadians appear to walk on an angle. Not to mention the problem with US based cash registers with only four or five coin slots.
Inflation has devalued the dollar to at least 1/10th of its 1950s value. So why not get rid of both the penny and the nickel. Price things with one decimal point after the dollar. And don't worry that prices will only round up. You know that something now priced at $19.99 is going to go to $19.9, not $20.0. Within a year prices will average out, due to competition.

"If it costs 2c to make a penny, and 10c to make a nickel, someone is ripping you off."
It may sound crazy, but the fact that the currency has to be devided, you have to have pennies and dimes.
That penny or dime will then move from hand to hand for some number of years, thus covering its cost.</div>

That same site you listed says a lot:
http://www.moneyfactory.gov/newmoney/main.cfm/currency/new5
It says the giant Helvetica 5 is for people with poor vision. I wonder if there's any way to imitate braille on paper (that would stand wear and tear). Some of the high contrast numbers with ball serifs could get a little difficult to read, I suppose, depending on vision. I guess Gotham, or the likes were still too newfangled for them.</div>

<div class=commentbody>David - I'm not sure changing the colors is really going to help the blind. I think more likely we'll see either varying sizes/shapes or some sort of embossed element that can distinguish the notes - perhaps even braille.
Chris - it works backwards too - a penny costs 2¢ to make and a nickel costs almost a dime.</div>

<div class=commentbody>They did abolish the penny in Canada, although ours cost 1.6 cents to make, as against 2.4 cents for the American penny. But then, Canadians have been easier to push around, which is why we have loonies and toonies while the Americans rejected the Susan B. Anthony dollar, and why we went metric but the Americans didn't... and the Americans don't even have gun controls.</div>
