  &#41;.  I know many of you know the system inside and out, but I&#39;m convinced
  there may be someone out there who will be at least as lost and confused as I was.  So...
  <BR> <BR>After pulling my hair out, learning hex-counting, how to write a codepage
  for FontLab, how to write an encoding file for FontLab, how to alter the &#34;uranges.dat&#34;
  file in FontLab, and generally learning more about the broad AND fine points of
  Unicode than I ever wanted &#40;or at least ever thought I needed to know&#41;,
  I discovered that I&#39;m using an older &#40;and free of any updates whatsoever&#41;
  version of MS Word. <BR> <BR>You can&#39;t do this. <BR> <BR>No one told me this
  specifically, but after trying everything I could think of &#40;and I mean that--no
  less than one hundred experiments were performed&#41;, it&#39;s the most logical
  conclusion to come to. <BR> <BR>So update the programs you can update; read the
  FontLab/TypeTool, and Unicode manuals; eat healthy and drink eight glasses of water
  daily.  And if you feel that you must alter existing or write entirely new data
  files, for God&#39;s sake make sure you actually need to!'
