    body: Mostly headlines, subheads, and sidebar text. I think Auto is going to be
      the one, though.

  body: "I haven't used either of these types, but they both look wonderful in their
    showings. I think it is just a question of how much 'juice' you want in the look.
    \r\n\r\nWhat I really like about Stalemate is that it manages to be a 'neutral'
    face and have warmth. -Most of the neutral faces are too chilly for my taste.
    \r\n\r\nAuto is gloriously exuberant. The question is whether it is too much for
    your use, or you want that exuberance. So for 'fun', Auto. For a bit quieter,
    but still warm, Stalemate. "

  body: "Clearly Auto has more flavor, and maybe is a bit more now, but I could get
    tired of it more rapidly depending on context. Maybe part of the consideration
    would include the kinds of advertising and pages included. Some alumni mags I've
    seen have some really bad type here and there. This can bring the total impression
    of the pub down. On the other hand, if every page is clean and fab that's something
    else.\r\n\r\nAll that is to say, if you have good creative control of the content
    Auto might distinguish itself more. Stalemate might anchor the pub better if you
    have tacky ads to contend with.\r\n\r\nWhat's the text face?"
