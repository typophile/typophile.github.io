body: "My career began in 1942 as an apprentice in the composing room. Because of
  WWII I was able to get several jobs; working at the College Press under the tutiledge
  of Richard Hoffman and a night job at LA Type casting the first arrival of Times
  Roman.\r\nBecause of the pursuit of the alphabet it led to working with some of
  the best in the busines: Saul Bass, Herb Rosenthal and Charles Eames. My commercial
  career began in the early 1960's with the revival of Jugenstill fonts and becoming
  an agent for Bertold.\r\nI was able to bring on the photolettering market many original
  design under the name of Facsimile Fonts and later FotoStar International.\r\nMy
  hobby is letterpress printing and I still cast type on the Linotype and Ludlow.
  I presently write under the name of Dr. Type in the magazine Recognition Revue.
  I am no longer working with type fonts because of the pirating."

  body: I'm 100% against pirating fonts but I think that as for music and as for movies,
    the type designers has to find a way to sell their fonts. House Industries work
    out a fetish concept for their typefaces, I don't know if it will work but it
    has the advantage of being original. I think that time has changed and that the
    new generation of type designers has to deal with it. I'm really curious of how
    they will solve it and I don't think that stopping to work with type because of
    pirating is the solution.

  body: "The thing with piracy Robert is that most people who don't pay for a font
    wouldn't pay for that font. If they can't get your font for free, they'll just
    get some other font for free; they generally wouldn't pay for your font anyway,
    because they don't think this stuff is worth money. So mainly all it does is increase
    the variety of the fonts we see used out there, without hurting designer profits
    much. It's unnerving, but we shouldn't let it rattle us.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'I think Robert is also considering some foundries as pirates who have taken
    his designs, digitized them, and are now making money from them. But, Hrant you
    are right. Pirates wouldn''t pay for he font to begin with ... BUT ... that is
    still generalizing. I''ve seen statements such as, "I''m only using these to test
    the font then I''ll license it if the design is improved." I''m all for a good
    test drive, but I think this is where the real problem comes from. Designers who
    aren''t willing to go through the proper routes to test and license their fonts. '

  body: "> Robert is also considering some foundries\r\n> as pirates who have taken
    his designs\r\n\r\nOh. That's better termed plagiarism. And it <em>used to be</em>
    a big problem; it's notable that it happens very rarely these days, and when it
    does, or when it's perceived to have happened, like in Segoe, the outcry is palpable.
    Typophile actually serves as a great backlash mechanism in such cases, and the
    font houses do pay attention. So Robert, this might actually be a great time to
    resume your retail type design work!\r\n\r\n(I just hope Uli doesn't jump in though...)\r\n\r\n>
    Designers who aren\u2019t willing to go through the\r\n> proper routes to test
    and license their fonts.\r\n\r\nBut that's an education issue, not a \"prohibition\"
    issue.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I think that the main problem is not who is pirating what but how to make
    people want to buy fonts. This is the new challenge and we should think seriously
    about it.
