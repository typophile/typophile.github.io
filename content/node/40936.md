body: "Hi all - I am doing an OT font in FLS 5. It has only latin characters plus
  the four figure sets with accompanying currencies etc and numr/dmom sets along with
  a handful of ligatures. That is, I guess, as simple as it gets. When I generate
  my font and use it in InDesign, the OT features are bracketed, i.e. unavailable.
  I have read other threads here and tried to paste text like \"languagesystem DFLT
  dflt;\" into the OT panel in FLS, but it never works, it only sometimes gives me
  an error message. \r\n\r\nIt must be a simple problem, and I realise that I am ignorant,
  but I would really appreciate if someone could give me clues to a solution ...\r\n\r\nPer
  Baasch J\xF8rgensen"

  body: "(Still me \u2013 first profile that I forgot I had ...)\r\n\r\nI have designed
    the font with all characters, but the testing in FSL is not of much use since
    I can't find out how to change between for instance the different figure sets.
    \r\n\r\nI was sort of hoping that there might be some basic coding publicly available
    that I could paste into my OT panel. It ought to be the same thing for most fonts
    like mine that don't have many special features. It would, I think, also be in
    the interest of the people behind  the OT technology, that OT fonts get on the
    market and function correctly. \r\n\r\nAs I am not a full time type designer,
    I can't spend that much time on figuring out technical stuff in fonts far beyond
    the actual drawing and spacing of letters. I hardly get any income from all the
    hours of work on my fonts, as is surely the case for many of my colleagues. But
    maybe the OT-people actually have made that kind of coding, and I just haven't
    found it yet ... he said wishfully. "

    the fonts work if they don't contain the necessary code.\r\n\r\n> <em>I was sort

    any case, I'm including the code below that will get your four sets of figures
    working. Copy and save it in a file with a .fea extension. Then it's just a matter
    of opening it from the OT panel in FLS. (Before trying to compile the code and
    start getting errors, make sure the glyph names used in it match the glyph names
    in your font)\r\n<code>\r\n@FIG_TAB_LINING = [zero one two three four five six

    now. It ain't easy being blond in this brave new world ...
