    pointy things don't equate well with 'adult products'...at least for me. Maybe
    I'm not daring enough? ;0)

  body: "Well, who's it targeting? Aside from colors (which are feminine), I'm getting
    a very male vibe with the pointy figures and the mudflap girl. I typically would
    group adult stores into two slightly different demographics: 1) women/married
    couples and 2) Long Haul Truck Drivers. \r\n\r\nThis seems to fit the latter OK,
    but not the former. If you're aiming for the former, I'd think a bit softer, maybe
    even a bit more abstract."

    a different silhouette - maybe try and integrate it into the logotype rather than
    just banging them together at random.\r\n\r\nAnd the pink is a bit dull -- something
    brighter and funkier would be much better -- use a neon where possible for instance."

    Nice progress; the lines between the girl and the "A" are a bit thin and will
    be hard to reproduce though.

  body: "The progression between layout 1 and the rest is heading in the right direction.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I saw a girl and a wind-surfing sail in pic 1, and ever since cant seem to acknowledge
    the \"adult store\" idea behind the communication. Im kinda getting a beach bar
    or resort-like feel from these.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could deepen the colours so
    they were less \"candy\"/girly and a bit more erotic? Rich purple and perhaps
    a vivid orange?\r\nMaybe you could find a nice clean san-serif font and sit the
    girl inside the bowl of the 'a'?\r\n\r\nThe progression of ideas is good so far
    - keep pushing it and playing with it.\r\n\r\n:::::::::::::::::::::\r\nWicked

  body: "Like Nightshade, it feels more surf shop than adult store to me. That curving
    triangular shape is more closely associated with the shapes on surfboards, sharks,
    and sails for many people.\r\n\r\nI scaled down the image, to simulate it being
    seen from a distance, and the woman gets pretty jumbled with the A form. It's
    not illegible, because it's similar to the truck flap girl that everyone knows,
    but it's confusing if you don't know what to expect.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/small_3551.gif]\r\n\r\nPart
    of this is the details, the other part is the super-thin lines. And most importantly,
    I think the lady needs some help. Her silhouette may be accurate to a photo, but
    her body makes lots of weird shapes when in a silhouette. Imagine if someone could
    only see her upper body by covering her legs and hand - the shape that's left
    over doesn't read as a human form to my eyes. I think the drawing needs to be
    stylized a bit, or at least considered further. <a href=\"http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&rls=en&q=truck+flap&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi\">The
    truck flap girl</a> works because they use a profile silhouette, which allows
    them to emphasize her bust and show the profile of her face. This helps to make
    each part of her body feel like a part of a body on its own.  The human form doesn't
    contain straight lines, so be careful when using them, particularly for feminine
    forms. Her back and legs should not have straight lines. Also, her arm is a bit
    anemic and her elbow's a bit knobby. Don't take it personally, I'm sure she's
    a great person. But figure drawing can be tricky and these are key points to help
    a figure feel more vital and sensual.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you should look at some old
    <a href=\"http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&rls=en&q=pulp+novels&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi\">pulp
    novel covers</a> or some Varga girls for some better buxom, curvy silhouettes.
    Going for an archetype is a better bet for a logo, which must be a bit more iconic
    than a simple illustration.\r\n\r\nI look forward to seeing where you go with
    it."

  body: "I'm still not entirely sure of your target demographic. If it is, indeed,
    the truck-stop type place, this will work (ie, mainly a male-centric clientelle).
    However, pink might not be the way to go in that case.\r\n\r\nAs it is now, I'd
    suggest adding a right hand to the women extended outward from her body, and have
    her 'hold' the a. Just an random idea that may not actually work outside of my
    head. ;o)\r\n\r\nIf the 'truk-stop' isn't the type of place you are branding,
    and are trying to bring in a more female/couples/mixed clientelle, I think you
    should play with some more abstract ideas."
