    Swash</a> from Jukebox but that doesn't appear to be an exact match. Interesting
    that 'Cabernet Swash' from Jukebox has nearly an identical ampersand.\r\n\r\nIt's
    really annoying that Veer doesn't let you Flont the \"&\" symbol. :\\"

  body: "i noticed Cabernet - but its only the italic version that has this - and
    that mark is italicised. \u2013 this one is straight.\r\nEloquent looks like the
    best quality cut ill get of this mark - though as you say - not exact.\r\n\r\nif
    anyone knows the exact font id be really interested.\r\nJ\r\n\r\n typ01134 blog

  body: "What it matches exactly is the alternate ampersand of  Pistilli Roman (a
    film type shown in the 1985 Phil's Photo book called \"Homage to the Alphabet\").
    The closest digital font I know to Pistilli Roman is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/carousel-lt/regular/characters.html|Carousel]],
    however Carousel does not have this alternate ampersand. It also has differences
    mainly in the lower case (e, g, k, v, w, x, y, z). Uppercase K and Q are different.\r\n\r\n\r\n-
