body: "I'm not a typographer, so bear with me. I posted in general discussion about
  a variation that I made on a the characters zero, one, and tilde in a typeface.
  I tried to leave everything else alone. The characters themselves appear fine, but
  there seems to be a glitch (stray point? reversed curve?) in one of the fonts because
  the line spacing gets expanded, even during a FontBook preview. \r\n\r\nI am using
  FontForge, and it doesn't seem to indicate any particular problem.\r\n\r\nCould
  someone take a look at these and see if the error jumps out at them? Even narrowing
  it down to which variant is the troublemaker would be helpful. \r\n\r\n<em>[Link

    them :(\r\n\r\nWhy did you choose .dfont as file format? .dfont is only supported
    on Mac OS, do all biologists use a Mac? ;) I'd generate the fonts as TTF, these
    are more widely supported.\r\n\r\nRe. your line spacing problem, have you set
    the vertical metrics to identical values in all four fonts?"

  body: "Thanks Jens --\r\n\r\nI chose .dfont out of ignorance -- was the only option
    I saw in FontForge that would bundle them together like that.\r\n\r\nI uploaded
    a TTF set here:\r\nhttp://www.computingforbiologists.org/files/CourierPCfB.ttf.zip\r\n\r\nI
    didn't set the vertical metrics myself because I started with the full set and
    just made a few edits. (I only see horizontal in the menu?) That could have been
    automatically set somehow? At one point I tried connecting an open path with an
    arc during edits, and it created a big loop out into the netherworld. I think
    I successfully undid that change, but maybe it altered that vertical setting in
    the process.\r\n\r\nI also did save them once with a stray point, and maybe that
    altered things? \r\n\r\nReally appreciate it!\r\n\r\n-Steve\r\n"

  body: "I ran your fonts through a test tool, FontQA, and these are the errors that
    were found:\r\n\r\n<em>Some contours have less than three nodes.\r\n\r\nCourierPCfB:
    zero: (x=388, y=392)\r\nCourierPCfB Bold Oblique: mhook: (x=1163, y=16), rhookturnedsuperior:
    (x=688, y=529)\r\nCourierPCfB Bold:\tmhook: (x=1149, y=16), rhookturnedsuperior:
    (x=565, y=529)\r\n\r\nSome composite glyphs have empty components.\r\nCourierPCfB:
    zerowidthspace->(uni0000), zerowidthnonjoiner->(uni0000), zerowidthjoiner->(uni0000)</em>\r\n\r\nI
    believe the last error, the empty components, are responsible for the wrong linespacing
    calculation. When you delete the empty components from these three glyphs, it
    should probably work okay."

  body: Oh, and if you want all four fonts in one file, you could generate a TTC (TrueType
    Collection) format. But I'm not sure if FontForge supports it yet.

  body: "I truly appreciate your time on this. I will check those elements. It is
    a little weird that of those, I only knowingly edited the zero, but may have inadvertently
    put a dot after selecting a space... Glad to see it is not an issue of a reversed
    path or something else over my head.  \r\n\r\nI ordered typeTool (= fontLab junior)
    and maybe it will export TTC. \r\n\r\nI'm really impressed by the quality of discourse
    on this board. When we have a more final cover design for the book, I'll definitely
    post it here for critique. "
