  body: The holy trinity of black-red-and white jst seems like too easy of a solution
    to me. I think that there is too much associated with that combination, especially
    amoung designers &#40;who would be your target audience as a seller of type, no?&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>The colors, with the beautiful intricate forms of your drawings/letters,
    just cry out &#34;goth&#34; to me. Not that there is anything wrong with that,
    mind you. It just seems that you will be more likely to speaking to a different
    audience. <BR> <BR>Its always hard for me to settle on the right color combinations,
    so I really can&#39;t offer any great advice. A professor of mine once told me
    that all the color combinations that we need can be found in nature. Another told
    me once to work with three colors, two of which should be close to each other
    in hue and value, and then the third could be a compliment or a split-compliment.

    thing about the red. maybe it should be brighter and little less cyan. looks like
    you are around pantone 201 ... maybe try something like 1805 or 1807? this is
    beautiful, i&#39;m only suggesting. I don&#39;t see goth at all. too beautiful

    looks great, it&#39;s a very indulgent and lush look, which is certainly complemented
    by the dramatic colour choice. <BR> <BR>Have you considered replacing the white
    with a metallic foil for business cards? A gold or silver foil would further heighten
    the impact of the design and visually offset the complex tracery of either design.

    though. <BR>The truncated paws and hand holding a torch <BR>looks a bit like cut
    out tapestry. It feels  <BR>like something&#39;s missing to me. I would get <BR>rid
    of it and replace it with the floral pattern. <BR>On the second logo, the dragon
    is beautifully merged with the K. Just superb work. My only complain on this one
    is the flower at the tail. It distracts from the name. I would just leave it out.

    seems to be a lost art. <BR> <BR>I think another solution to your color issue
    might be limiting where you use the red. Use the red as the extra punch and not
    the main show.  Looks good though!

  body: The design is gorgeous, but will all of those little filigrees survive at
    actual business card size? <BR> <BR>This would make an incredible poster for sure.
    <BR> <BR>When I looked at the reds, they looked like a gradation from a dark blood
    red, to a more vibrant red. I assume this is an optical illusion, but I like the
    effect, regardless. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d also recommend trying some variations, such
    as a striking sky blue, or a rich, mossy green with the same value as the red.
    The red/black/white combination is one of my favorites too, but I could see a
    &#39;goth&#39; interpretation of what you currently have &#40;even though I didn&#39;t
    take it that way&#41;. Perhaps a nice, rich rust color would give a wrought-iron
    feel to the scroll-work. Could be nice.

  body: I also saw tonal variation as a result of line weight, an effect which might
    be magnified at small sizes. <BR> <BR>Another idea which would look very elegant
    &#40;but perhaps a bit too subdued&#41; is to emboss/deboss the graphic area and
    apply glossy spot varnish to those areas. Especially if you use a nicely textured
    stock, it could turn out very nice.

    ornament weaves through the typography with such grace- it is poetic. I haven&#39;t
    seen that degree of finesse and craft in a typographic solution in a long time.
    Deboss, emboss only if you can find a printer that can match the finesse and intricacy
    of your design.

    questions first: <BR> <BR>The images are indeed stock, from the Pepin Press book
    <BR>called &#34;Signs &amp; Symbols.&#34; I didn&#39;t reply for so long because
    <BR>I was awaitng confirmation on whether I could legally use <BR>the images.
    As it turns out, I can. However, it was always  <BR>my intention to modify them.  <BR>
    <BR>I agree about the paw holding <BR>the torch, it looked off from the beginning.
    I love all the  <BR>suggestions about ebossing, foil stamping etc. When I get
    <BR>the squids together I shall investigate this seriously. At the <BR>moment,
    I will have to gang up on another print job, which <BR>is one colour, a black
    purple. See the attached image for  <BR>colour and new filigree. The rest of the
    type is Jenson Pro, <BR>which I found tucked away inside Indy CS. Is it too much?
    <BR> <BR>As for the dragonbirdthing, I have been playing with the <BR>idea of
    paying a subtle homage to our native bird, the <BR>Kiwi. It is a flightless endangered
    beauty and the de <BR>facto icon for New Zealand, pretty much why we get  <BR>called
    kiwi&#39;s. So here it is on my logotype. Does it work <BR>any better? I am in
    the middle of vectorising the thing. <BR>Quite tricky. The split-stroke type is
    my own. Hopefully <BR>released one day as well. Thanks for all the feedback. <BR>

  body: kris your work is very elegant. As for the colours i would recommend to make
    the combination it suits you best and don&#39;t get confused with afterthoughts
    like &#34;will it communicate with everybody?&#34;, since your work and taste
    already is not concerning &#34;everybody&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Personaly i prefer the
    black-red-white variation mainly for the reason that the &#34;KLIM&#34; is not
    messing with the pattern &#40;as i think it happens in the last two variations&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Also i think you sould &#34;liberate&#34; the &#34;Type &amp; Graphic
    Design&#34; and &#34;Mobile...&#34; lines from the block. The compination with
    the leaves doesn&#39;t work as it does with the &#34;KLIM&#34;. Further i believe
    you should avoid the &#34;stop&#34; of the block that puts a &#34;wall&#34; in
    front of the leaves. I would advise you to put the lines in an order that follows
    the rythm of the leaves as the typography is not foreign to the nature but it
    is inspired from it. <BR> <BR>thanx for the nice design and hope that the dotted
    line around the card it is not the croping line and it will be print. <BR> <BR>christos

  body: Great cards. Can&#39;t decide which one I like best between the dark and light
    versions.  <BR> <BR>I agree with Christos and would take your title and mobile
    numbers out of the block, maybe on border somewhere and using the lighter shade
    of the dark so as not to distract attention from the center. It will be dithered
    though. <BR> <BR>The bird on the other hand has morphed into some kind of weird
    gryphon. It doesn&#39;t remind me a kiwi for sure with those huge wings. I think
    you should either stick with the dragon theme or go with the softer more lyre
    bird look. In that case the wings seem too predatory. I&#39;m nit picking of course.

    white stock was never rich enough. Also, the type dosen&#39;t feel the same when
    it is simply a hole in an ink-covered page. <BR> <BR>This is a beautiful project
    and I hope that you will have the chance to print it with an outstanding printer!

  body: Yeah? Thanks Robert! I have considered foil <BR>and varnish. I would be a
    bit hesitant about  <BR>printing white then red, wouldn&#39;t the registration
    <BR>be a rather large issue? Does foil on black stock <BR>work quite well?

  body: Foil on black works well, but best to do a test first. I think foil would
    be best for this situation as it is extremly opaque. <BR> <BR>I was wondering
    about the trapping issue related to the white and red inks as well when I wrote
    the post. If the red were spread out things would probably work. The black should
    cover up a slight overflow of the red. If someone knows a lot about trapping &#40;certainly
    not me&#41; I hope that they could sound in on this.  <BR> <BR>A really excellent
    printer could probably do it kiss-fit, but those printers are few and far between.
    &#40;I know a printer here in Montr

    <BR>Oops! Sorry spelt it wrong Metalure inks &#40;this is a trade <BR>name and
    they might be available under different  <BR>names&#41; are for gravure, flexographic
    and screen  <BR>printing and are metallic inks but, instead of having the  <BR>graininess
    and frankly disappointing effect of normal  <BR>metallic inks, replicate foil
    blocking without the  <BR>occasional rough edges. <BR> <BR>Tim <BR>&#40;and this
    gets me off the nelson&#41;

    it, cos it will have probably  <BR>posted. The Klim logo is custom. I designed
    it and <BR>it only resides on my computer at theis stage. I don&#39;t <BR>think
    it will be a complete font for general sale, that <BR>would seem a bit odd. But
    there will be a regular <BR>version finished one of these days! I&#39;ll keep
    y&#39;all <BR>posted. <BR> <BR>kris.
