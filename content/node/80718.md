body: "This sample is from a swedish poster from 1916. There are two different fonts
  that interests me.\r\n\r\nThe first (the small one) is somehow familiar, but I honestly
  doesn't have a clue. There are some details in the f, e, r and A that is really
  interesting. \r\n\r\nThe second (the big one) looks lika a Bodoni, but haven't found
  the exact weight. It's compressed but it is'nt Compressed Poster.\r\n\r\nIn both
  cases, I also would appreciate tips of alternatives that have quite the same looks
  and feel.\r\n\r\nAny clue?"
