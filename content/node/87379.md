  set on Adobe Illustrator.\r\nBut there happens a problem when it is imported or
  copy and pasted onto Fontlab.\r\nMy font is based on rounding dots like a pixel
  font for LED signage.\r\nThe circles are distorted in Fontlab.\r\nIs there anyone
  who has a solution for this problem?\r\nI guess that I may need to use another font
  editor.\r\n\r\nOn Illustrator, I actually started to draw a line and changed to
  dot line and then automatically outlined.\r\nIt was for my systemic design concept.
  Is this a part of the problem of distorted circles?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5143.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_6525.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4334.png]\r\n<!--break-->\r\n"

  body: "There is no alternate font editor to solve your problem.\r\nWhat you are
    seeing is the result of the rigid 1000 UPM-grid inside a font, that allows for
    points (and also bezier points) to be placed on that grid only.\r\n\r\nWhat you
    can do now (in descending order of importance): \r\n\r\n\u2013 Set your points
    at the extremes of the shape. This minimizes rounding errors. Specially working
    with circles, that should be fairly easy.\r\n\u2013 Do not paste outlines that
    are too small. This will definitely give you rounding errors, as the points cannot
    be accommodated on the grid. The AI document should equal the font editor\u2019s
    settings \u2013\_e.g. it should measure around 1000\xD71000 pt. A typical x-height
    in that document is around 500 pt.\r\n\u2013 choose a higher UPM in the font editor,
    for instance 2000.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In addition to the sound advice shared by Frank, it appears that this particular
    case is complicated by Illustrator's odd placement of points when it converts
    the dots to circles\u2014 it places four points offset from the extrema, plus
    an \"extra\" point at the bottom extreme which is the most to blame for the distortion.
    Unfortunately, cleaning up such paths is not one of Illustrator's strengths; there's
    no equivalent to FontLab's \"Nodes at Extremes\" and no way to remove extra points
    without distorting the shape. (There is at least one plugin that includes these
    features\u2014 VectorScribe, formally known as BetterHandles.)\r\n\r\nThe best
    solution (short of redrawing the circles manually) would probably be to go as
    large as required in Illustrator to minimize the rounding distortion when pasting
    to FontLab. Then use FontLab's Optimize feature from the Contours menu to reorient
    the points, and remove any extras. This might require using a higher UPM, or possibly
    scaling down the outlines after optimizing (although scaling may also cause rounding
    errors, you can judge whether the final result meets your desired level of precision)."

    it might be possible to use the Find/Replace Shapes feature to replace them with
    non-distorted circles. See the current thread: http://typophile.com/node/87360"

    might want to look into some alternatives that keep the handles straight. \r\n\r\n(To
    me it seems you drew two circles, blended those and then rotated the resulting
    \u2018string of pearls\u2019. A better method would be drawing the start- and
    end-circles in their final positions, and then applying the blend operation.)"

  body: "@frankrolf\r\n\r\nI think the problem is in the way Illustrator draws the
    dots for the \"dot lines.\" If the lines themselves are anything other than orthogonal,
    the circles are draw \"perpendicular\" to the line: that is, if the line is slanted,
    the circles will be drawn with extrema orthogonal to the line, but at a slant
    globally. \r\n\r\nSo, the problem isn't as you described it, but the solution
    is: the characters created using the dot line can be used as templates, but the
    final, exported characters will have to be composed with circles with properly-aligned
    extrema, using either blend function or align-and-distribute."
