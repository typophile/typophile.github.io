  any direct influences, I just thought it would be fun to make a really condensed
  slab serif.  It's the first time I do something like this and the main goal is to
  learn as much as possible. I realized that making a condensed typeface may not be
  the best thing to start out with if you want to learn all the classic proportions,
  but I went for it anyways. \r\n\r\nIt's all done from scratch and it's meant to
  be used in sizes 16-48pt. I haven\xB4t worked anything with the kerning och spacing
  yet.\r\n\r\nI appreciate all the input that I can get!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    full curls. Not sure about the \"y\".\r\n- Have full double serifs at the top
    of the \"A\".\r\n- Give the \"J\" a full curl, and maybe not make it descend.\r\n-
    Make the \"Q\" not so wimpy.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Thank you for the feedback! I totally agree with with you about the \"f\"
      and \"j\", but do you really think it will work on the \"r\"? \r\n\r\nThe \"y\"
      is a letter i've been having some problems with. It's hard when it's so condensed,[[http://i.imgur.com/tTi2J.png|here]]
      is an earlier version of the \"y\", but i think it's way too black. Do you have
      any suggestion how I should approach it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Good curve shapes.\r\nThe thinning of the tails of Q, y, j are definitely
    out of place; get them up to slab weight.\r\nBottom half of S is looking comparatively
    heavy.\r\nConsider making the bowl of P taller.\r\nMaybe restructure the M to
    ameliorate the clotting of the top corners.\r\n6 and 9 could stand to be a little
    less square."

    body: 'Thank you! The tails seems to be the things I really need to work on. My
      vision was too make something a bit more characteristic with tha tails, but
      it might be too inconsistent compared to the rest of the typeface. Both the
      "S" and the "M" are two letters i''ve been struggling with and will definitely
      give them more work.  '
