  body: Thanks guys. Only thing is, the terminals of the S at the angle... that what's
    really distinguishes this I'd say. The search continues, but thank you for your
    help.

  body: "It's possible that someone customized the terminals with a little outline
    tweaking of the points. If I was doing this I would probably start with Knockout
    70/71/90 and play with those. Knockout has the right shapes for most of the letterforms,
    like the R, G, O, S and E, with only a little terminal tweaking, and maybe tiny
    'squooshing'. I apologize if this is too crudely pragmatic, but sometimes this
    approach saves a lot of time.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
