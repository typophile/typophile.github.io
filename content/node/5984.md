body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Most people seem to make pixels versions of fonts after they&#39;ve
  made outline version - for me <BR>it&#39;s the other way ... and i need some advise
  .. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve redrawn some of my old Amiga pixels fonts from the early 90&#39;s
  in Bitfonter - and now i want to make the outlines &#40;in fontlab?&#41;so people
  can use them on screen. <BR> <BR>I have Fontlab/bitfonter/scanfont - but the outlines
  that FL makes no fit at all - the lines only fit the bitmap shapes loosely .. <BR>
  <BR>help is need!

  body: I fellow Amigan! <BR> <BR>So you want to end up with an outline font that
    matches your pixelfont? If you want the outline font to be blocky, it shouldn&#39;t
    be too hard with the right settings in FL&#39;s autotrace. But if you want a &#34;smooth&#34;
    outline font to be the result, you&#39;ll have to do it by hand. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: '   I&#39;ve always drawn outlines from bitmap, &#40;or from bitmap size ranges&#41;
    first with a reverse-of-hinting approach, i.e. where can/should I place that outline
    so that hints CAN get to that bitmap &#40;remembering e.g. that you have 63/64ths
    of a pixel variation for the body width of all but e.g. the i&#39;s&#41;, and
    then, what does the result look like and how do I get a decent outline font out
    of it, and finally if you need to, reconciling whatever you can&#39;t get in the
    outline with either the olde mental delta, or change the damn bitmap. At least
    that is how I would do it if I had to &#34;make the outlines so people can use
    them on screen.&#34; [presumably to look the same as the bitmaps].Hope that helps..
