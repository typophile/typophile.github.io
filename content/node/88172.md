body: "I think I've been looking at this for waaaaay too long, but I feel as if no
  matter how many hours I spend moving letters by 1/1000 em increments, it still doesn't
  look right to me. My company uses \"Univers Light\" as its *official* font, and
  I hate it! I just feel as if some of the letters have awkward spacing/are disproportionate.
  Anyway, I'm really stuck on the \"PLAY\" part of this headline. Can anyone help/does
  anyone have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you so much for any feedback!"

  body: It looks overall too loose to me. I would move the A left and then move the
    Y left even more.

    link at the bottom of the comment field. No spaces in the name, try for 500px
    wide to avoid a horizontal scroll and be mindful of file size. Not sure what the
    cap is off the top of my head."

  body: "Getting back to what Joshua said: To my eye \"LA\" is too loose. That is
    the most (naturally) gaping hole that you need to control (and that will, in turn,
    help define the other spaces). Try not to look at linear distance of letters to
    each other, but rather the space (size of white area) in between.\r\nAlso, the
    wordspace is maybe a little too narrow compared to the inter-letter space.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and max width for inline images is something around 590px. I've used 590 successfully."
