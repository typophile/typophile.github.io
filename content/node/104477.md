  body: "Heavy editing of a Didone or Bodini.  A region in the middle of the font
    is extremely stretched to create vertical strokes -- angled for the s -- and what
    was probably a ball terminal on the a is amputated.\r\nDon't know if its worth
    seeking out the precise victim of this surgery. \r\nEasy to see version of your

  body: "I gave up after trying to find a high contrast font having an a with the
    center stroke tapering upward into the rhs stem, a c with an upward spur, an e
    with a sloped crossbar, and Didot style serifs for stems.\r\nBut I still wonder
    who did this combination.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: Reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/spire|Spire]] but that's
    not it. I guess reworking something like [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=Abraham%20Lincoln|Abraham
    Lincoln]] the way suggested by Don could get you pretty close.
