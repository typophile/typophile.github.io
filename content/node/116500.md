  this font is - or can you direct me to a similar one?  \r\n\r\nIt's on an old 60/70s
  shop front in London.  Obviously handpainted (on a painted glass panel, bizarrely).\r\n\r\nWould
  be grateful if anyone knows of a (free) similar font if we can't identify the actual
  font. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nNed"
