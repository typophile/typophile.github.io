  body: The fat numerals look pretty much Bodonish, but how come the most digitized
    Bodonis don't have them?

  body: "The  serif font is a Bodoni all right, but it is not the Haas or Bauer version,
    because of the 't'. I think the 'a' looks most like the Ludlow version, where
    the serif curls back a bit more than the Linotype or Monotype versions. We are
    talking about metal type, and I know there were Bodonis from every foundry, so
    this part will be based more on what samples we can find of metal type showings,
    but are you more interested in a digital Bodoni that seems close than in finding
    out what metal typeface was used?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "<cite>...but are you more interested in a digital Bodoni that seems close

    I'm not using these typefaces anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I posted these,
    though, is that I wanted to know the typeface in the first example and even more
    how on earth did they come up with such poor typography. There are even some stains
    here and there on some pages and the letters are jumping up and down. The typeface
    doesn't work in that context (Bible) and is a nuisance to read in big chunks.
    I paid a lot for this Bible, it's a rare piece and an old translation that isn't
    sold in Finland anymore.\r\n\r\nThe second Bible (even older edition and translation)
    is far nicer to read and the printing job is clean, but \u2014 being a web designer
    and all \u2014 I have no experience of identifying or judging print typography
    (the ink spread especially is foreign to me).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm surprised that
    it's Bodoni in the second example. It looks tremendously different from the Bodonis
    I've used to seeing on-screen.\r\n\r\nThanks for the info though, it was very
    interesting and useful to know."

  body: "Well, to me the most un-Bodoni part of it is how dark it looks, like a medium
    or almost bold weight. The contrast is less than you expect to see. For ID purposes
    I would like to see certain other letters, like b, C, W and Q if they show up
    in Finnish. Those letters could confirm whether Bodoni was used. I think my <a
    href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php\">Serif Font ID Guide</a>
    could help identify this with a few more Key letters. The closest font I get using
    it right now is <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_a/augustea_full.gif\">Berthold
    Augustea</a>, which shares a lot of the Bodoni letterforms, so I admit I am at
    a loss. \r\n\r\nDo you think Augustea looks closer? It was designed in the early
    1900's, so it should have been available.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Augustea is a pretty nice match. And no, there isn't C, W or Q in native
    Finnish words, and although they're in our alphabet, I doubt they will be found
    in the Bible (how many names beginning with Q or W do you remember from e.g. Hebrew?).\r\n\r\n<cite>Well,
    to me the most un-Bodoni part of it is how dark it looks, like a medium or almost
    bold weight.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's exatcly what surprised me. The high contrast
    there on the paper is nothing like the hair-thin lines onscreen. The contrast
    is more like that of Baskerville's to me.\r\n\r\nBut I've always been under the
    impression that the effects of ink spread has been \"added\" to the typefaces
    when they were ditigized. That's why the digitized Centaur looks so thin and suffering,
    because  the design was based on metal type and not how it looks on paper."

  body: "One of the letters I mentioned that you didn't exclude from Finnish was the
    'b'. If it has a straight stem, then that rules out most Bodonis, which have a
    horizontal serif at the baseline. The other clue would be the G, which is cut
    off in your sample. If it has a 'beard', then it is not Bodoni.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    Round Face</a>, which dates from 1906 (it was a Monotype typeface).\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think of that one? (We are still compiling the Serif Font ID Guide, but

    is the uppercase J which is wider in your example. By the way, has it been digitized
    under some other name? Or is there anything similar in contrast and style in the
    digital world?\r\n\r\nNot that I'm about to print a Bible or anything, so don't
    quit your day job because of this type ID."
