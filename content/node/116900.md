  and purchase from.</strong>\r\n\r\nBack in the 1990's, the first foundry that I
  was hooked on was \r\n[[http://www.houseind.com|House Industries]].\r\nI discovered
  it by reading a newspaper in which I noticed [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/housegothic23|<em>House
  Gothic</em>]].\r\n\r\nLet's hear from you\u2026"

    FontFont back in the day (c.1990), in particular the classic vibe of their black
    + PMS 115 direct mail \uFB02yers and brochures. \r\nSo, no surprise that they
    published my \uFB01rst digital type design, in 1994."

  body: "I meant license from others, as in the OP\u2019s \u201C\u2026purchase [licences]
    from\u2026\u201D, not licence to.\r\n\r\nSo I have changed from licensing fonts
    <em>from</em> others, which I did in the early days of digital, when I was working
    as an art director and graphic designer, to licensing fonts <em>to</em> others,
    since I have been publishing fonts full time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
