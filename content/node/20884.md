body: "Need some advice on this type/image I'm working on for press kit that will
  go to Russian media outlets. This is my first draft. The final design will be screen
  printed on ready-made presentation folders, a bright color on a dark colored folder.
  The Russian title translates roughly to \"Rock against Racketeers\", the story is
  about a theatened music equipment factory in Russia.\r\n\r\nNot being a Russian-speaker
  I'm having some trouble determining if this design will read with my Russian audience.
  I've consulted with a Russian friend regarding mixing the English and Russian, and
  he thought Russians would know the word VOLUME since most sound equipment they buy
  has English labels, but he didn't see it as separate from the title and part of
  the image.\r\n\r\nHow does this read to you? Does it seem like part of the title,
  or is the language variation enough to separate it?\r\n\r\nAny other comments on
  type/design (whether you know Russian or not) are also appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RussianDesign_3726.jpg]"

  body: "If you are concerned with the word \u201CVolume\u201D cutting into the title,
    then don\u2019t worry about it, language difference is enough. Just an idea regarding
    the word at the bottom\u2026\r\nBE33AKOHNR- BE3 translates as \u201Cwithout\u201D
    3AKOH = \u201Claw\u201D and NR is just an suffix,\r\nyou might play with that
    a bit\u2026 \r\nWell good luck with your design.\r\n"
