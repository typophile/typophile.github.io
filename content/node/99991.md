  trying to test the font I'm working on in InDesign but a lot of glyphs are showing
  white spots where contours merge. When getting very close (+800% magnification)
  everything looks like it should. The problem is I need to check my font at small
  sizes and the white contours make it impossible. I thought that FL merged contours
  on export... I don't want to merge contours yet since I'm not finished tweaking
  characters shapes. Is there any solution? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

  body: First, check that your path directions are consistent. Then, embrace the fact
    that you're using a computer and can save multiple versions of your file. Keep
    at least one unmerged and one merged and copy changes between them.

  body: I've seen this before. I'd bet you've got part of the character down twice.
    I got the same effect in the early days by copying a glyph, then at some point,
    inadvertently pasting it over itself. (I was making up accented characters before
    discovering that using the composite technique was a real time-saver when you
    change your mind about some little detail...)

    contours and decompose glyphs before generating test fonts, so best to save a
    copy and generate from that. You can automate some or all of the process by using
    an Action Set or a macro (see Ben Kiel's scripts for generating test fonts at
    http://benkiel.com/typeDesign/ )."

  body: "@Graphirus: I believe you're looking at the technical reason in your screenshot:
    overlapping areas are very often rendered as negative space, especially in Postscript-based
    fonts.\r\n\r\nRegarding weirdness in merging contours\u2014 in your above screenshot,
    merging contours in glyphs like the /a and /u probably won't pose much of an issue,
    but glyphs with large overlapping areas like the /p or multiple overlaps and crossing
    contours like the /x and /t <em>could</em> produce unpredictable weirdness and
    extra points requiring manual clean-up. So you should certainly do a thorough
    check for any such oddities before generating a finished font. "

  body: You should draw clean outlines no matter what your final output format.  It
    is some work but not so terrible to keep track of outline pieces and overlaps.  Keep
    all the pieces in the background if you need them but learn to draw cleanly.

    that's OK, but it really is easier to clean up as you go along. And my experience
    -- for what it's worth -- is you cannot rely on program functions such as \"remove
    overlap,\" \"optimize,\" \"set path direction,\" etc. for correcting the particular
    error that occasioned this post. The original purpose of these routines  wasn't
    to correct this kind of error, so don't squawk when they don't fix it. Again,
