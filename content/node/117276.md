body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've got a question about composite glyph creation. I'm not sure
  if this is a bug in FontLab or i'm doing something wrong but FontLab has just stopped
  generating composite glyphs for characters like \xE1 \xE5 \xE2 \xE4 \u2026 even
  though there the accent glyphs and base glyphs are all there with their properly
  names anchors. If I delete \xE1 for example and then click on it again to create
  it just gives me a blank glyph, and every now and then just the base glyph. I don't
  understand this behaviour, it seems buggy but I don't know how to fix it. Does anyone
  have any ideas or has this happened to anyone before.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be an
  issue across all fonts where this once worked, so seems to be a issue with font
  lab, not the font itself, but I can't work out what. I've reinstalled font lab and
  no luck.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    FontLab/Shared Data/alias.dat ... is that file present? Do the contents correctly
    show the accented characters?\r\n\r\nThe location of the file can be customized

  body: "Thank you for your answers. I did think it might be the alias.dat file (that's
    what I gathered from other message boards). There is an alias.dat file in /Users/me/Library/Application
    Support/FontLab/Data\r\n\r\nThe same folder in the shared library was empty so
    I copied everything across there and I told Fontlab where to look for the alias.dat
    file through the preferences dialog (as you also suggested) but this seems to
    have no effect. When I try and create empty glyphs it still fails\u2026. It's
    so frustrating as I cannot finish my font now and there seems to be no way of
    fixing it. Any other ideas on what could be wrong other than it being buggy?"

  body: "Can you create the glyphs by hand, that is, double click on an empty cell,
    then, using  (key sequence with Windows) Alt+insert, select the character wanted
    -- say an \"a\" . This should place that character, with original sidebearings,
    in that cell. Then repeat the process for an accent, say \"acute\" (or properly,
    acutecomb, if you've added the combining diacriticals. In any case, alt+insert
    brings up a dialog window window lets you select the character you want to add.)\r\n\r\nThese
    characters will be composites, you can decompose if you want the hard, fast glyph.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can do that, and if *they* don't go away as you've described elsewhere, then
    I'd think the problem does lie with the .dat files -- something isn't getting
    made correctly. On the other had, if they do go away, I believe they're doing
    so without .dat involvement. \r\n\r\nFWIW"
