  caps. That&#39;s special, cause not all typefaces do. Any help would be greatly
  appreciated. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/310.jpg"

  body: The display face on this site is Knockout from the Hoefler Type Fountry. <A
    HREF="http://www.typography.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.typography.com</A> <BR>
    <BR>There are several condensed weights of Knockout available that may look similar,
    but the specimen above is not Knockout... &#40;note the lower case g.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>My guess is Trade Gothic condensed or perhaps News Gothic condensed. <BR>
