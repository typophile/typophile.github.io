body: "i need help. are any of these directions working for anyone?\r\n\r\ni'm having
  a heck of a time finding a visual that embodies the word champfactory--at least
  a visual that is uncluttered, and holds its color well. think either addidas logo,
  nike or apple--simple, curvy blocks of color.\r\n\r\nthe product is a card game
  based on motorcycle racing that has been developed over time to embody many different
  types of racing, although its still motor-sport based as opposed to say, track and
  field.\r\n\r\nso, i can try to create something illustrative of an actual factory
  that pumps out winners, or i can simply go for an illustration of winning, or speed,
  or strength, or other attributes of a champion.\r\n\r\nthis graphic is not coming
  easily to me, and i've ruled out trying to make a wordmark due to the sheer length
  of the name. it may be time for me to put it down and come back later with a clean
  slate.\r\n\r\nany ideas, anyone?"

  body: "I think 7 and 8 have speed but the winning is a bit obscured by the 1, I
    think if you are going to distort a character you should begin with a more usual*
    one. I might try using a non-oblique wordmark, because the impression of speed
    in photography is increased by having a stationary object in the foreground. Further
    to Hrant's suggestions you might think of a chequered flag which is probably more
    universal and can be made into a powerful graphic, along the lines of the simple
    logos you mentioned.\r\nTim\r\n\r\n*bit subjective but I hope you take my point"

  body: The Id needs alot more than a logo. You could do anything with a mark like
    that and it would mean nothing. I think your client needs to  think about branding
    not just a mark. What is it that they are selling or bringing to market? Get a
    marketing report or make them generate one for you. You need a point of reference
    to start from, like who are you talking to!
