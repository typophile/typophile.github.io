    :) So far it looks pretty bland to me. I don't think there is enough contrast
    between your name and the symbol. Also it feels like a two-men company (I think
    the space between your firts and last name is too big). But again, I don't know
    what message you want to send.\r\n\r\nP.S. I just saw a dog's ear and a Q-tip
    in it, sorry, can't stop seeing it now. I just got a dog, that's probably why.
    I wouldn't worry about that:)\r\n\r\nJan"

      hence the symbol inbetween my name. it also remotely calls for \"new idea\"

  body: "My problem with making a mark that reflects software is what if that software
    becomes an antique or the company that makes it get bought. I would suggest finding
    another image for a mark or just use your name and a line explaining what you
    do like: visualfx compositing.\r\n\r\nThe type is well spaced but boring, visit
    some of the Indie type companies and see some more contempory, leading edge font
    ideas."

  body: "The very first thing I thought of was The Rolling Stones' <em>Flashpoint</em>
    album cover. Not sure how you feel about this association, that is probably going
    to be very strong with some people.\r\n\r\nHere are the <a href=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=rolling%20stones%20flashpoint&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&sa=N&tab=wi\">Google
    Image Search results</a>. See what I mean?\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think it's
    a bad logo, but it's treading familiar ground in a very common manner. The personality
    is missing. Make it your own. Make it unique."

  body: You need equal space between your first name and surname(to much space before
    Aypar) I would also think about adding another outline around the flame and experiment
    with the image in the middle of the flame..it doesn't look fluid enough..a little
    choppy as far as the illustration goes. The kerning looks very good and the font
    will work well with a more unique icon in the middle.
