  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is my first attempt at a typeface which isn&rsquo;t based on a grid or systems based approach. I&rsquo;m very much a beginner at typeface design but looking to improve as quickly as possible so please criticise as much as you feel like.</p>
<p>The typeface is tentatively named Solzhenitsyn after the book with the lettering that it is based off. The lettering in question should be below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/font2_5222-2_6393.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I loved the caps on the title and wanted to try to create a full alphabet from this. My first very rough drafts are below and a pdf is attached for a closer look.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/folio_6348.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/test_4280.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A quick all caps print test.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/folio4_4729.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Being pretty new to the actual design of typefaces I&rsquo;m unsure if this is a good start or if there are a multitude of errors hidden away within what I&rsquo;ve done. I&rsquo;m also now wondering if I want to create a faithful replication of the title or modernise and try to make it more relevant to today?</p>
<p>Either way please wade in and criticise. Any feedback would be incredible and most helpful!</p>
<p>Cheers,
Max</p>

<p>I love the subtlety in which this is still a semi-serif. Nice starting point.</p>
<p>Are you sure this doesn&rsquo;t already exist as a font? (did you post it in the type ID section?)</p>
<p>I will come back soon to give you proper feedback.</p>

Why not both?! :-)
- in /bdgpq/ the curved thick of the bowl looks lighter than the straight stem
- thin pointy top of  /t/ doesn't mesh with the relatively blunt terminals elsewhere
- shortness of ascenders may be too extreme for a typeface (what works with the particular letters on the book cover won't necessarily be generalizable metrics). 
- more space in the counters of /MNW/ would be useful
- /X/ looks heavy and wide
- /CG/ tops seem too thick
- maybe the little pinches at the tops of the caps should be more subtly done
- spine of /s/ is too dark
- waist of /P/ should probably be lower

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I’m back! A few comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>In agreement with Craig&rsquo;s comment, /MNW/ are too dark. The left vertical stems should be thinner, at least near the diagonal. In your sample the vertical stems don’t vary in contrast, whereas in the book cover there is a tapering towards the diagonal, which gives the glyph more energy and lightens things up a bit.</li>
<li>That pointy ended top of the stem of /a/ doesn’t really work IMO.</li>
<li>The modulation of the bowls of /adbpq/ is not as soft as in /CGce/. I would take those as reference.</li>
<li>The crossbar of /f/ could have the same height as /t/.</li>
<li>The crossbars of /ft/ are too pointy.</li>
<li>/L/ looks too narrow to me. I think the width in the book sample was adjusted to compensate for the gap of the /LZ/ pair.</li>
<li>The terminal of /jgyJ/ is also too pointy. A more rounded terminal would fit the style of the typeface better.</li>
<li>/Jj/ are too wide, especially /J/.</li>
<li>/T/ is too narrow.</li>
<li>The top right serif of /Y/ is too pronounced.</li>
<li>/z/ looks great!</li>
<li>Soften the bottom of the left diagonal of /y/ at the bottom corner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next time you could set a few alignment zones so that your image samples don’t look so different from the PDF samples ;-)</p>

<p>LexLuengas – In answer to your question, I did yes. It was posted a good while ago in the font ID section, although all the comments pertaining to it seem to have since disappeared for some reason. No ID was reached, the closest match being Laudatio.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t show well in the jpeg but the stub serifs seem to vary slightly between the same letters and the Z in Zurich and Solzhenitsyn are quite different which led me to believe it was a piece of custom lettering rather than a typeface. The book is a 1976 edition.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just managed to work my through the rest of the feedback ha. All of which is helpful.</p>
<p>Both of you seem to say it&rsquo;d be better to ease off on the slightly pointy nature of it so far, that being the top of the t, the jgyJ terminals or the crossbars. That was probably me trying to force something which didn&rsquo;t quite fit into it..</p>
<p>Do you think that by raising the crossbar of the f I would have to raise the terminal and probably the ascender height as well? Which would probably feed into the position of the i dot as well.</p>
<p>And did you mean to take the bowls of the &lsquo;CGce&rsquo; as a reference?</p>
<p>Sorry about the sample images&hellip; Alignment zones will be learned and used for when I&rsquo;ve reworked it. I&rsquo;ll try and make some of these changes in the next day or two.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote>Do you think that by raising the crossbar of the f I would have to raise the terminal and probably the ascender height as well? </blockquote>
<p>Test, then we’ll see. Sounds all like coherent decisions, but you’re looking too far into the future ;-)</p>
<p>Looking at it for the second time, I agree the ascenders may be <em>a tad</em> too short and Bob’s suggestion may be worth giving a try.</p>
<blockquote>And did you mean to take the bowls of the 'CGce' as a reference?</blockquote>
<p>Uh, yes. I didn’t realize I was being vague. Try keeping the smoothness of the bowls of /CGce/, especially at the bottom where it approaches the stem (it will of course bend more than in those reference characters, but I think you can still reflect its &ldquo;speed&rdquo; of thinning).</p>
