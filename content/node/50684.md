  a modern typeface by historic elements. I used the Helvetica, then drawn again,
  apply ornament and it became like this. \r\nMay i have a question that : How could
  contemporary designer, especial typographer use historic elements and why they must
  care about history? \r\n\r\nthanks!"

    have a historic element to them, actually. Especially alot of serif faces. A large
    portion of them have influences that come from a certain historic typeface. Be
    it Jannon, Garamond, Fell, Baskerville -- to give a few examples -- or just a
    more generic style such as 'Dutch', 'English', 'Didone', etc. Either as a revival,
    or just as an influence. I think this is the main historical element that is used
    in modern typography/type design. \r\nWhy care? I think because typography and
    type design are crafts that have a very significant and long history behind them,
    so there is alot of work that can inspire modern type designers. "
