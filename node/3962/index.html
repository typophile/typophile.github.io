		<div class="commentbody">&quot;Typology&quot; is a good book for a quick visual coverage on the history of type. I find that I use it more for inspirational and less for historical purposes. &mdash; In fact, all of the books by Stephen Heller and Louise Fili are useful for this purpose. &mdash; Used in conjunction with books that are more academic they can serve as very useful for visual reference.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i agree. typology is a good jumping off point. it covers different periods and movements, but doesn't provide intricate detail. surely you need to know something more specific than &quot;the history of serif type.&quot; what about it? just general info or do you need to go deeper than that?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Isaac <BR>It's nice talking to you. Thanks for the opinion about the book.  <BR>Actually I need to do a work for my pos graduation about &quot;the typograph on Vogue magazine&quot;. They use three but I will study two. Didot and Garamond. So, I think that is very important to know about the history of both, of serif type and all about typograph. What do you think? I must study another subject or what? What book I should read to find good informations? <BR>Iforgot to say that my work, or my problem is to realise if this two fonts &quot;say&quot; the same things that the magazine. We know that is a fashion magazine but the project was done well with this fonts?? This is what I must do. <BR>Can you or anybody help me?? Anything!?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I dont know if I have aread told but I'm from Brasil. Now a days this two fonts make part of this magazine. I will make a research about who created Didot (Firmin Didot) and talk about Neoclassicismo ( I dont know how can I call this in inglish ), and Napoleao Bonaparte and French revolution. I beleave that everything that &quot;come to life&quot; has a reason and carry a lot of situations and experiense n the &quot;backstage&quot;. Than I will make a comparison with the days that we live, the period in art history and the culture that we live in. <BR>And the same with Garamond <BR>I dont know if I was clear but a hope that my english dont interfear in my communications with you. <BR>No, I haven't write nothing until now. I'm in a project time. Last week I handed over to my teacher as a text. Next year I will start actually. <BR>But I swear that I will send you, ok Tiffany? <BR>Thanks so much. <BR>Do you have some to ask me or to help? <BR>Do you read some book that will be very important to me?? <BR>God bless you!!!</div>
