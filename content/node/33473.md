body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have been working on the branding of a company, but they do not
  like my choice of body font Bodoni in italics\r\n\r\nThe font will be rolled out
  on everything from stationary to the campaign adverts.. I have cused Bodoni Italic
  Bold/medium/light as this font, treated as so, but they dont like this, they feel
  it is dated (what the??)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typofile_5381.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnyway
  it has to work with certain quotes used througout the work eg:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quote_5491.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone has any suggestions, i am after a similar serif font, elegant with some really
  nice curves, but quite soft in its nature. \r\n\r\nfonts i like, but am not sold
  on certain charaters,\r\n\r\n  Didot, im loving this but im sure its way to elegant
  for them..\r\n\r\n  Ziggurat italics, dont like the \"Y\" as this is a crucial character
  in the brand name., but i think this font has the softness i like..\r\n\r\n  Souvenir
  italics, this has the softness, but lacks the class as in bodoni and didot.\r\n\r\nAS
  you can see im just really after any suggestions, that you guys have of similar
  fonts, obscure, personal favorites anything at this stage will help me..\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

    1980s to early 1990s. Unless you\u2019re doing fashion work, where a Didot or
    Bodoni can still work, a Bodoni identity is going to look very, very dated.\r\n\r\nYour
    other choices-Ziggurat and Souvenir\u2014also speak much more to the past than
    to the present. What sort of company is this that you feel it needs to have an
    identity with a period look?"

  body: "\"Dated\" is probably just the handiest term they could think of - even if
    it's not totally accurate there's something to it: Bodoni looks like some regal
    gandfather, aloof and old. In fact it's almost dead. As G W Ovink put it: \"Bodoni
    is an admirable letter for a death notice!\"\r\n\r\nDidot will have the same problem.\r\n\r\nSouvenir
    is just retarded looking.\r\n\r\nI might recommend Mrs Eaves, as long as you won't
    be using it for anything over a line here and there, since it needs manual [re]spacing
    to look decent. Or you could try a Baskerville. Or maybe The Foundry's Wilson.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
