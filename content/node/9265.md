  just a beginner. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I can&#39;t seem to get my Typography dialog to

  the string from Setting is being used for the whole group, rather than just that
  setting, and for non-exclusive options, it does not appear next to the checkbox.
  <BR>For reference, the top of the palette is supposed to look like this: <BR> <BR><pre>Ligatures

  <BR>What am i doing wrong? <BR>I tried putting dummy noncontextual headers in the
  MIF with no content and setting code 0, but these were ignored by ftxenhancer when
  updating the font &#40;I&#39;ve not tried using AATFontTool under classic yet, will
  do so while I await a reply :-&#41;. Any suggestions?'

  body: Nicholas,  <BR> <BR>I have run into the same problem. I&#39;m pretty sure
    that the ftxenhancer application has a bug so it assignes wrong names to wrong
    features. It&#39;s essentially &#34;off by one&#34;. In a font I was trying to
    build, it assigned the small caps feature to the standard ligatures caption, the
    standard ligatures feature to the discretionary ligatures caption, the discretionary
    ligatures to the swash caption etc.  <BR> <BR>You may have luck by decompiling
    the font using TTX &#40;<a href="http://www.font.org/software/ttx/" target="_blank">http://www.font.org/software/ttx/</a>
    &#41; and manually correcting the &#34;feat&#34; and &#34;name&#34; tables.  <BR>

  body: 'Yes, it is a bug in ftxenhancer. It is assigning each item in the <b>feat</b>
    table a value from the <b>name</b> table that is one too high. For example, if
    it should give you item 271 from the table, it&#39;s giving you item 272 instead.
    I&#39;m guessing the code incorrectly started counting items at 1 rather than
    0. <BR> <BR>You can work around it &#40;and I do&#41; by dumping the <b>feat</b>
    table as XML, fixing the ID references, and then fusing it back into place. If
    you automate this with a script, it&#39;s not so bad. <BR> <BR>Use: <BR> <BR>1.
    <b>ftxdumperfuser -t feat -o myname.feat.xml -f &#39;My Font Full Name&#39; myfont.dfont</b>
    <i>&#40;or myfont.ttf or whatever&#41;</i> <BR> <BR>2. Edit the table with BBEdit
    or whatever. You&#39;re looking for lines that start with <b>featType</b>; you&#39;ll
    have one for each feature type in the font. Here&#39;s an example from one of
    my fonts: <BR> <BR>&#60;featType type=&#34;10&#34; settingCount=&#34;4&#34; settingOffset=&#34;00000080&#34;
    flags=&#34;8000&#34; isExclusive=&#34;YES&#34; nameIndex=&#34;263&#34; name=&#34;Vertical
    Position&#34;&#62; <BR> <BR>Subtract one from the &#34;nameIndex&#34; property.
    In this case, 263 would become 262. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t edit the <b>featSelector</b>
    items &#40;which are the specific actions in your font&#41;, however!! Their indexes
    are correct. <BR> <BR>3. <b>ftxdumperfuser -t feat -d myfont.feat.xml -f &#39;My
    Font Full Name&#39; myfont.dfont</b> <BR> <BR>That&#39;s it. <BR> <BR>Note that
    the only difference in the two command lines is the -o vs. -d flag. Also, if you&#39;re
    not using a multi-font suitcase &#40;.dfont&#41;, you can omit the -f &#39;My
    Font Full Name&#39; part of the command. <BR> <BR>Brent'

  body: 'Also, a &#40;perhaps?&#41; little-known fact: your TrueType fonts can support
    both OpenType and AAT features at the same time; they each are stored in separate
    tables in the font file. <BR> <BR>Generate your font as a .ttf or .dfont with
    OT features from FontLab or wherever, then post-process with the ftx tools to
    add your desired AAT features. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s double the work, but until Apple
    adopts OpenType in its native text routines, it&#39;s a way to provide typographic
    functions in both InDesign and Apple apps &#40;such as Pages&#41;.'

  body: 'Brent,  <BR> <BR>I will jump in here with some breaking news. We at Fontlab
    Ltd. have just released TransType Pro 3, a new professional font converter: <a
    href="http://www.fontlab.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fontlab.com/</a>  <BR>
    <BR>One of its very cool features includes the conversion of GX/AAT advanced typographic
    features into OpenType features. The converted font that TransType outputs will
    contain only the OpenType layout tables, but a following scenario is possible:  <BR>
    <BR>1. You use FontLab 4.6 to create a font in OpenType PS &#40;.otf&#41; or OpenType
    TT / TrueType &#40;.ttf&#41; format without any features.  <BR> <BR>2. You create
    a MIF file that contains GX/AAT features and add them to the font using ftxenhancer.
    If needed, you correct the bugs produced by ftxenhancer.  <BR> <BR>3. You use
    TransType Pro 3 to convert the OpenType font with GX/AAT features into a font
    with OpenType features. The conversion does not 100% of all GX/AAT features, but
    a quite fair number, including some contextual features. I believe you can convert
    directly into FontLab&#39;s VFB format as well that will include the OpenType
    features code in source FEA notation but have not been able to verify it now.  <BR>
    <BR>4. &#40;Optional&#41; You open the font in FontLab. FontLab will decompile
    the OpenType features into source code and you tweak them manually. You generate
    a new OpenType font that includes the OpenType features.  <BR> <BR>5. You use
    ftx enhancer once again &#40;with the same MIF file&#41; to add the GX/AAT features
    to the new font. The resulted font will include both OpenType and GX/AAT features.  <BR>
    <BR>If you use the process, you will end up with only needing to write the MIF
    file from scratch. TransType Pro 3 will generate the OpenType features for you.  <BR>
    <BR>And to answer your questions in advance: TransType Pro 3 does not do the features
    conversion in the other direction, i.e. from OpenType features into GX/AAT features.  <BR>
    <BR>Regards, <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd. <BR> <BR>Ps. See you at TypoTechnica

    <BR>Sorry, I was mistaken. This is not possible. TransType Pro 3 can convert &#42;from&#42;
    FontLab VFB but not into this format. Not however that TransType Pro 3 includes
    a similar conversion engine as FontLab Studio 5 so those of you who don&#39;t
    want to wait for FontLab Studio 5, can save their fonts in FontLab into the VFB
    format and use TrT Pro to generate their fonts.  <BR> <BR>Adam'
