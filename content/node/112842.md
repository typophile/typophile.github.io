body: "Hello Typophiles.\r\n\r\nMy name is Alvaro Franca, I'm an aspiring type designer
  and I've been doing some research on newspaper typefaces, their specifics, needs
  and whatnot and came to wonder a couple of things in regards to what they used to
  look like and what they look like today. \r\n\r\nWhat we can see today, at least
  here in the UK, is a tendency towards the more Swift, Guardian, Greta Text kind
  of face with nearly horizontal arches, shallow crotches, very open apertures, very
  horizontal hooks on characters like /e/ /c/ that create a certain strong horizontal
  continuity in blocks of text, wedge-like serifs, little contrast and very little
  (if at all) calligraphic influence. All the basic needs of newspapers are covered
  though (saving space, printing in small sizes, and in porous paper). the letterforms
  have narrower proportions, large x-heights and strong, sturdy details that survive
  to reduction.\r\n\r\nBut it used to be that newspapers would print in old style
  type fonts, and you had a staple in the industry in Times New Roman, which is also
  somewhat narrow, with sturdy details and a large x-height, but in everything else
  it is diferent from it's contemporary counterparts: it has quite a bit of contrast,
  a humanistic kind of construction, bracketed serifs, smooth arches, closed up apertures...\r\n\r\nIs
  this only a matter of style and taste or is there something to gain from a legibility
  standpoint? Old style forms are tried and true, and the so called \"contemporary
  serif\" has been around for thirty odd years and has some threshold in that playing
  field aswell, I wonder which of the two is more confortable to read in a newspaper,
  something you ocasionaly have to read under bad light, in public transportation
  and other such not-so-confortable environments....\r\n\r\nI ask because I love Swift
  to death and wanted your opinion on which of these kinds of faces are more legible
  at small sizes since I wouldn't trust just my own judgment, being as I am still
  a novice in these matters.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there is any point to the discussion,
  it's just something that's been on the back of my mind :-)"

  body: I'm not a type designer, but in the U.S. (and other countries I assume) sales
    of printed newspapers are declining as younger people read the news online, and
    advertisers move to the web. Perhaps some changes in printed newspaper design
    are attempts to make newspapers more appealing to younger readers.

  body: "For news setting I personally favor wide fonts (with large x-heights) for
    these reasons:\r\n\u2013 Wide fonts can be set at smaller point sizes than narrow
    ones: you end up with the same apparent size, but you don't lose the space savings
    every time there's a paragraph break (something very frequent in news typography).
    Basically you predictably save <em>vertical</em> space on every line no matter
    the text.\r\n\u2013 In terms of readability wide fonts leave more room for bouma*
    divergence.\r\n\u2013 In terms of \"mood\", wide is earthy (while narrow is classy)
    and that suits news.\r\n\r\n* http://themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the input Hrant! I hand't come across the concept of bouma yet,
    that's very interesting!\r\n\r\nJames, I did read that argument in some of the
    statements released by the newspaper re: their bespoke font families, which again
    leads me to think this is ultimately a matter of style, as Old Style fonts do
    appear too traditional. The papers also mentioned the need to for a cross-platform
    solution to their typographic identity, something that could work in print, the
    web and epub equally well...."

    read individual letters (although not sequentially, but in parallel). To me that's
    anathema to how the human brain lives.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    but having short descenders is particularly useful."
