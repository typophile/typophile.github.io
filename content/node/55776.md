  of font marketing (and digital ethics) changed considerably when I read Chris Anderson\u2019s
  essay on \u201CFree\u201D in Wired, although I haven\u2019t got around to incorporating
  my new attitude into any marketing plans yet.\"\r\n\r\nIs anyone else considering
  changing (or has already changed) their approach to marketing, having seen the commercial
  success of Jos and others who have demonstrated the 'freemium' model?\r\n\r\nIf
  so, how are you planning to make the 'freemium' version inferior to the 'premium'
  one? Taking out OpenType features and alternate glyphs? Publish just a single member
  of a family (as FontFont has been doing for a while)? \r\n\r\n:-)"

  body: "It depends on how you define free. In the case of some free downloads of
    fonts, you are actually just licensing the font without paying the traditional
    fee. In other words, instead of paying $30 for font X from family Y, you pay $0
    for font X from family Y. But in order to download the font, you must still agree
    to same EULA that you would if you had paid $30 for it.\r\n\r\nThere are also
    other foundries that bundle a free version of another font whenever you make a
    general purchase. So if you license family Z, foundry A will also give you a license
    for font X of family Y, both to thank you for being their customer, and also in
    the hope that you might like to someday license the rest of family Y.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know about taking out the OT features or the alternates, and then distributing
    that as an alternate version. I could be convinced of its benefit, but I tend
    to think that it might be too much work to go through on the distributor side.
    Would it recoup its cost? In theory, anything that recoups its costs might be
    worth a business considering."

    foundries? :)\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I understand \"freemium\" to mean, \"available
    at zero price as a 'loss leader' for something else that costs money\" - I didn't
    mean \"free as in modifiable\" etc and so avoided the word 'free' :)\r\n\r\n"

    freemium is really a real word.\r\n\r\nLinotype has doen this sort of bundling
    option in the past. I'm pretty sure that Monotype has, too. Maybe just surf around
    fonts.com a bit."

  body: "Offering free fonts from a family of other (paid for) fonts is what Jos has
    done so well. I am sure that the quality of his offering is paramount here: his
    free fonts are not crippled in any way, they are well crafted and with extensive
    character sets, and what's more, he gives away the (medium and medium italic)
    most useful members of the family and charges for the peripheral ones. The other
    vendors are more likely to give away the least popular cut, say semibold italic.\r\n\r\nI
    tried a similar approach with one of mine and now can see it around, used in the
    free fonts, while the sales of the paid fonts are minute. Well, it may just be
    a dud. That said, it worries me a bit. Apart from all the more or less professional
    fonts bundled with operating systems or applications, the free fonts available
    on the net are quite abundant, and some of them are not at all bad. There seems
    to be a lot of talented people out there who will release a free font just to
    see it used somewhere. What is the longer-term future of fonts for sale? "

    download the free stuff rarely end up buying. Free fonts get you blog press and

    It all lead to the point where I am now because I gave away my free fonts (of
    higher quality than most other fonts) at that time with no other intention than
    to share them with the rest world. \r\n\r\nStephen, I can't remember saying that,
    but I do agree. BTW Traffic is all about sheer numbers \u2014I'm now counting
    about 6,000 hits a day\u2014 and the fact that there are (and always will be)
    people who really want to make a purchase. They just have to like your fonts and
    have to know where they can find them."
