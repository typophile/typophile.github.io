body: Has anyone used <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/scanfont/" target="_blank">FontLab's
  <em>ScanFont</em></a>? If yes, what are its strengths and weaknesses. --- I'm just
  wondering, aloud, if it might help jumpstart something on which I'd like to work.

  body: I fooled around with the demo version a little while ago. It beats the pants
    off of Adobe Streamline for tracing vectors from bitmaps. Which I suppose is an
    endorsement, since that seems to be all it&#39;s for.

    <BR>As I understand it, this is a &#34;plug-in&#34;, of sorts, for FontLab. So,
    for instance, if I were helping someone create a font from there handwriting...

  body: '&#34;Beats the pants off&#34; means it works a lot better. Sorry, I lived
    in Tennessee for 12 years and my hillbilly creeps up once in a while. <BR> <BR>I
    believe Scanfont is a small standalone app, more so than a plugin. But yeah, I
    used it to trace a friend&#39;s handwriting and it did a swell job. A hell of
    a lot easier than tracing it in Illustrator, and much prettier output than I could
    get from Streamline.'

    purposes? <BR> <BR>sometime in the near future I will be designing and  <BR>producing
    a book on the Indus Valley script. the  <BR>assignment will include transforming
    rubbings of a  <BR>number of the characters &#40;over a hundred&#41; into vector  <BR>art.
    I don&#39;t usually do this sort of production work, but  <BR>I&#39;m doing a
    favor for an under-paid, under-appreciated  <BR>professor who is getting this
    published. I&#39;ve really got  <BR>to manage my time on this one and I fear that
    darn  <BR>character table is going to kill me!

  body: 'As far as I know, the only requirement for ScanFont is that the raster image
    you process has to be a bitmapped TIFF. So, I <i>think</i> that it&#39;d possible
    to run those rubbings through it and get some good quality vector images. You&#39;d
    probably have to put each one in a glyph cell and export the glyph as an EPS. '

  body: Here are 2 images I just made in ScanFont&#39;s demo. They&#39;re from a crappy
    black and white image of the Sukothai Stone. Not a rubbing unfortunately. Both
    are from 300 dpi TIFFs, but the first &#40;the spotty one&#41; was bitmapped with
    a diffusion dither, and the second was bitmapped with a 50% threshold. They were
    output from FontLab as EPS files &#40;which could be done in ScanFont, but not
    in the demo version&#41;. Maybe this helps. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/11413.jpg"

  body: If you prep the images carefully, e.g. by adjusting curve contrast before
    converting to b/w, you can get pretty good results from ScanFont. Also, you can
    edit the position of glyphs on the bitmap within ScanFont, so you can align to
    and specify a common baseline. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t use ScanFont very often, but
    when I do I usually select the tightest fit in the tracing options. This will
    result in hundreds of nodes, but will very closely wrap to the bitmap outline,
    including all bumps and nicks. I then put the resulting outline in the mask layer
    in FontLab and construct a clean outline on top of it. <BR> <BR>I have S.R. Rao&#39;s
    book on decipherment of the Indus Valley script. Fascinating stuff, although I
    have only skimmed it.

    <BR> <BR>Hrant said... <BR><i>Heavy. So has your prof deciphered it or something?</i>
    <BR> <BR>from what I understand, he has made discoveries that  <BR>could be an
    important next step in understanding the  <BR>astoundingly complex script. of
    those who have  <BR>reviewed it, everyone has been exhuberant about its  <BR>pending
    release. unfortunately, given the small  <BR>academic audience, the run will be
    quite limited -- just  <BR>enough to distribute among important international  <BR>universities.

  body: I think ScanFont is a plug in of sorts since you must have FontLab or TypeTool
    to buy it, according to the FontLab web site. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d actually recommend
    having both ScanFont and Streamline as they are intended for different purposes
    and you can use them together. Streamline is more intuitive. Be nice if Adobe
    would at the very least upgrade the import and export features as long as they
    are still bothering to market the software. Last time it was upgraded was about
    the last time Fontographer was upgraded.

  body: ScanFont works as a plugin for FontLab on the Mac. On Windows, FontLab and
    ScanFont are independent applications. However, when ScanFont is installed on
    Windows, FontLab &#34;automagically&#34; gets a new feature of tracing the background.  <BR>Adam

    version is a plugin to TypeTool which you can buy separately or as a bundle. There
    is no price difference, but on Windows you cannot buy ScanFont separately from
    TypeTool - they are integrated. <BR> <BR>Speaking about version 4 for Windows:
    we are working on it, but it is too early to comment when it will be available.
    When finished, it will be &#40;a&#41; plugin to FontLab and TypeTool for Windows

  body: I just purchased ScanFont which I&#39;m using in conjunction with FontLab
    4.6 for Mac OS X. The major benefit that I see to using SF is it&#39;s ability
    to import eps files that contain all a fonts&#39; glyphs, and separate them into
    cells that can be sized and exported into FL. This is an <b>amazing</b> time saver!
    <BR> <BR>The problem I am having is defining which cells they are exported to.
    I am still trying to figure out the program, but this part so far has me stumped.
    I would like the letter &#34;A&#34; to end up in the cell defined &#34;A&#34;
    in FL. So far, all letters end up in random cells. <BR> <BR>Yuri, any clue what
    I am doing wrong??

  body: When you separate shapes in ScanFont, you can assign names to the shapes that
    correspond to glyph names in FontLab. You can assign names for individual shapes
    or to a sequence of shapes, which is particularly useful if you have a scan of
    a lot of letters. ScanFont should use these names to put the traced outlines in
    the appropriate glyph cells in FontLab.

  body: Tom, SF-Mac version 4.0 and SF-Win version 3.x are very different. I think
    that John mean Win version which allows to name cells inside ScanFont. We decided
    to not include this feature to version 4 on the Mac because it will not add much
    value - it is so easier to just drag-drop a cell to the correct place in the font
    than to fill in all names. <BR> <BR>OCR seems to be a good idea for ScanFont but
    we yet not made good algorithm that is really shape-independent.

  body: Yuri, thanks again, that makes sense. I was dragging one cell at a time and
    it was getting a bit tedious. I didn&#39;t think to select multiple cells and
    drag them to a starting point in the font. Once I did this, it all made sense.
    &#40;I&#39;m a little slow to catch on!&#41; <BR> <BR>This feature does not seem
    to be covered very well in the documentation. At least I wasn&#39;t able to find
    it.

    This TraceMaster is fully functional and works really fine. After generating the
