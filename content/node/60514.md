  body: "Out of all the ones I posted, this is the one I really wanted to figure out.\r\n\r\nWithout
    a doubt, some or most of it is customized. I am guessing that the designer started
    with a non-stencil serif and made it into a stencil.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to
    at least figure out the original font(s) that got tweaked."

  body: "Eric, I think you're right that it's a faux-stencil. Judging from some of
    the other samples you posted these guys seem to go for antique/obscure fonts and
    then cobble them up. Both k's in this sample seem clumsily altered. \r\n\r\nWhen
    I think about these letters, it looks like the lower case letters are a monotone
    serif (either italic or slanted Roman -- that 'a' style is not a script 'a', and
    most of the time it's not even an italic one), and the A and S may be from script
    fonts. The A sort of resembles [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/bellevue%C2%AE/fonts/|Bellevue]]
    in having the straight right stroke with the arched left curve. I don't know what
    to say about that S. Really.\r\n\r\nI'll try to think about an italic serif that
    might resemble these lower case letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thank you, Mike. Your hard work on this series of IDs is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nYa,
    now that I look at it, the cobbled parts do stick out a little more. But I think
    the sloppiness gives it an appealing organic/signish/graf look. And when holding
    the actual tag, the cobbled parts aren't as noticeable as when it is scanned and
    placed in 2D.\r\n\r\nI will also give this ID a shot myself."
