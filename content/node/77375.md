  tried whatthefont but it didn't reply any useful information. Mainly because the
  letters are attached to eachother.. I tried googling but the only thing that came
  close was this:\r\nhttp://www.hinderickxenwinderickx.nl/Images/Images/img15501.jpg\r\n(notice
  the S)\r\n\r\nSo, does anyone know what font this is??\r\n(see attached pic)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
