  Glamour & Glory...  it's out on MyFonts now, with a 25% introductory discount. Get
  it while it's fresh!  :)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/numina/\r\n\r\nNumina
  is an elegant, dignified, highly condensed modern display family comprising two
  complementary faces. Numina Glory capitalizes on the family\u2019s strong, relentless
  vertical texture, eschewing diagonals in favor of robust pillars, whereas Numina
  Glamour opts for more traditional letterforms for improved legibility and a classy,
  airy grace. Both faces are well-suited for headlines, logos, block quotes, and editorial
  work.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bla_5907.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bli_3980.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blu_6573.png]\r\n\r\nSee

  body: Many thanks for the helpful feedback I got here on Typophile! It was my first
    serious attempt at typemaking, and I had a lot to learn. Special thanks to Hrant,
    who did the base spacing on the fonts as well as some touch-ups to the letter
    shapes, as well as to Rainer, who helped me with technical issues and finishing.

  body: A beautiful addition to the Spire/Giorgio genre of elegant condensed sans
    serifs. Love the alternates! I predict this'll do well among editorial designers.

  body: "Very nice.\r\n\r\nIt just goes to show that formal invention is quite possible
    in mature genres, if done with taste and subtlety\u2014one doesn\u2019t have to
    follow the conventions slavishly.\r\n\r\nI like the way these are separate fonts,
    avoiding the elitism of doing one with the other(s) as a mere set of stylistic
    alternates."
