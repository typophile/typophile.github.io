  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I want to do a real quickie user study for my thesis, and would like your help. All you have to do is look at the curves below and choose your favorite. Then, in the thread below, tell me which one it is. It would be best if you don't look at the responses first.

What are you looking for? Above all, smoothness (or "fairness" in the CAD lingo). Anything that looks like an unsmooth transition should be rejected. All these curves are fairly smooth, so you're just choosing the best. Another way to think about it is, if you put down points at the peaks and valleys and asked the computer to draw a smooth curve through them, which one would you prefer?

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aesthetic_4003.png]

Later I plan to do this as a more controlled user study, with an interactive slider. But I want to get a rough idea of the range of curves that people find most attractive.

Thanks greatly!

		<div class="commentbody">I think it might be a mistake to present the curves sorted by "sharpness". The order might influence which one people choose. For instance, people might assume that the "correct" answer should be somewhere towards the middle of the list and so they ignore the top and bottom curves. It probably would have been better to have the curves in random order.

For your interactive test, you might consider e.g. presenting two curves at a time and ask the test subject to select the smoother one. You could also ask about other properties than smoothness, to hide intention of the study from the subjects. Things like, idunno, hard/soft, organic, natural/artificial, aesthetically pleasing. You could even throw in a few silly things like happy/sad or purple. Then again, asking for other things than smoothness might also make the subject focus less on the smoothness and make the answers less useful. I don't know.

Oh, and I liked 2.

Aw Michael, don't I get any kudos for suggesting that in matters aesthetic a plain ol' peak-to-trough mathematical curve is not worth considering? Can't we have something more nuanced, more human, more attractive to ponder? Something more typographically apropos?</div>

It would help if Raph had explained that to begin with. He still has the opportunity to add this information to the thread header. 

How about it, Raph? What is this actually for, and how does it relate to typography / type design?

Frankly, I'm a bit shocked and appalled at your parochialism. Making a mathematical model of how smoothness is perceived is uninteresting if the person doing it is a computer scientist? What of the pursuit of pure knowledge?

That said, yeah, this is for Spiro, and I've used these curves extensively in my own font designs. 1 represents the Cornu spiral, and 2 and 3 are other shapes that can emerge from the four-parameter curve equation. All of these are instances of the so-called "<a href="http://www.yoshida-lab.net/aesthetic/index-e.html">aesthetic curve</a>", which is coming out of Japan. I'm particularly interested in the family because I think going down the line (choosing a higher number) may make the curve solution more stable, less wiggly. Originally, I was thinking that existing models of perception of smoothness (such as MEC energy) would predict that 1 would be the smoothest and other exponents less so, and that I'd be sacrificing smoothness to get better stability, but now it seems like you might get both by choosing an exponent around 1.5 or maybe 2.

Hope you find that edifying, and I will definitely post a link to the chapter with the results when I get it done.

		<div class="commentbody">Raph, I gave my answer based on the feel of the typeface I'm designing, and what I like--which might change. I think Karsten and others, though, have a good point in saying that what you will want will depend the look of typeface that you want. 

Thus if you want the ideal tool for designers, it will allow designers to choose among curve type they want. This might be a nightmare for programming--I have no idea--but if you are after the most useful tool, that is probably the ideal answer. 

For example I was very struck, when I was looking at drawings for Merganthaler Linotype Old Face--which are based on blow-up projections of old Caslon foundry type--that the curves were something that one would never think of drawing with Bezier tools. The curves were somewhat 'scalloped', probably reflecting their origins in punch cutting with gravers. Here on Typophile one fellow showed how he achieved this effect using Bezier curves, and it was quite inventive. And the resulting designs had the feel of old type better than other deliberately 'antiqued' outlines.   </div>

I merely accepted your question as simply as it was stated. I accepted that for the purpose of my answer, the Universe consisted only of the variations you posted without anything such as purpose or reason. I was hoping to make as naive a choice as possible with one quick glimpse of the choices. If there were a choice two-thirds way between 1.5 and 2, I would have picked it but since there was none, I chose 2. I made no decision based on type design or letterform curves, just a knee-jerk pick among the possibilities. Basically, I was just trying to answer your question directly.
When trying to get data, variables are isolated and eliminated to try for clean results. To me, a curve is something without content. When you add a context you simply complicate the question (or simplify it depending on your point of view). The concept of "smoothness" is difficult to isolate, I admit. If you added 10 m ore curves, I might have chosen differently but again, I just accepted your universe as stated.

We get this rationale a lot around here with readability research.
The problem is that the scientific conception of "pure" knowledge skews towards that which may be expressed in simple numerical terms, which is, indeed, parochial, not to mention aesthetically banal--although of course these simple curves could be used to complex and interesting effect.</div>

Not everything in science is expressed in numerical terms--simple or complex--and that which is, may be true, profound, and aesthetically significant. For example the Pythagorean discovery of the numerical relations of length of vibrating strings and what sounds harmonious led to the development of the Western scales of music, IIRC. Discoveries in theory of vision led to the Impressionists. </div>

Yes, that thought well represents how simplistic and self-important science can be when it steps outside its comfort zone.
For an alternative approach:
http://www.amazon.com/Techniques-Observer-Modernity-Century-October/dp/0262531070

Rather than science leading to art, it's more likely that artists use science "to replenish the supply of metaphors", as Coleridge explained why he liked to attend Humphrey David's lectures.</div>

I mean, type designer could have a choise between types of curves which he or she wants. Of course, Raph can choose “the smoothest curve”, but if there are parameters which can be changed by type designers (visually?), leading to perfect control, everything is just like drawing Bézier curves.

Excuse me, but here in implying that art is generally uninfluenced by science except by "new metaphors" you are talking complete rubbish. 

According to [[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Impressionism|this article]] the impressionists were influenced by Helmholtz's work on color. I haven't studied the history, but I believe it was explicitly discussed and referred to by them. As this article also notes, earlier scientific studies in perspective and anatomy also affected art. 

Of course people like Leonardo didn't separate science and art. That was the later bad development of the split between Positivists, with their narrow view of science, and reactionary Romantics, with their narrow view of art.

I'm happy that Raph doesn't have such narrow views, and I have no doubt he is doing good work that designers will one day benefit from.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick etc., Raph asked a question about subjective preference among a given set of curved lines: out of this set, which do you prefer? He didn't ask which you thought was the best of a global set of all possible curved lines, and he didn't ask which you liked best in context of a specific typeface design (indeed, he didn't mention typeface design at all). 

The difficulty I have in responding to Raph's question is that, since the line quality is so consistent in terms of the smoothness of the curves, it really becomes a preference between rounder or pointier shapes, between curvaceousness and straightness, and I suspect that preference is influenced by too many factors external to the presented set of lines.

So, when I say that I like 1.5 best, I am conscious that I could provide rational grounds for selecting any of the others instead, and I suspect that the reason I choose 1.5 is very arbitrary and ultimately external to the presented set.</div>

And, in fact, this is a form that likely can't exist in any type design. So, we are left looking at nothing specific relative to type. If a section appropriate to type design, a subset of the curve for a particular form, is examined for usefulness or preference, the choices become objective, and perhaps it'd make some sense.  But I think preference for a line made with no purpose other than to test preference, is dangerously close to a preference not worth having or knowing.

Cheers!

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, why are you presenting the idea that "the territory is not the map" as an argument against me, when it's the point I'm making?!

This is what I'm saying, that beautiful curves are complex, and that one should be wary of trying to express them too simply with mechanical devices.

As an aside, I mentioned the bias of science towards numerical description (with elegance preferred to convolution), which I fail to see how anyone could dispute.

Having experience working (1) freehand, (2) with analog templates such as French curves and ovals, and (3) digital BCP path-drawing tools, it seems to me that each of these methods has its constraints and freedoms. The constraint of working freehand is, paradoxically, that it is difficult to form regular shapes in this manner.

I have been most noticeably confronted with the "transposability barrier" of curves between these three drawing paradigms when doing revivals, attempting to digitally duplicate the shape of letterpress forms. It is then that I find it necessary to add more and more BCPs. The most difficulty I've ever had was the top of Jenson's "a".
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jensona_4080.png]

I've no doubt that, in working with BCP software for twenty years, I've developed an aesthetic which runs in a semantic groove influenced by the parameters of this tool. I greatly admire Erik van Blokland for making many of his own devices.

While it's possible to mimic the effect of analog media with digital tools, in going against the grain it is time-consuming and impractical, and also contradicts the old artisitic precept of truth-to-materials. So, and this should please the technological determinist in Bill, there is a style to digital scripts:

But the fact that the territory is not the map doesn't render the map useless, it doesn't imply that the map does not relate to the territory, which is what your comments about 'pure knowledge' seem to imply. When you talk about the limits of particular tools in making particular shapes, then you make a lot more sense to me (although I've no idea what a 'semantic groove' is), because then you are recognising the ways in which the map does, in fact, relate to the territory: imperfectly but specifically. Then you are reading the map, which is a process of interpretation based on an understanding of the relationship of the map to the territory.

[All of which is irrelevant to Raph's original request, which concerned preference among a given set of shapes, not a question about what constitutes a 'beautiful curve'. While I respect your right to decline to participate, I think you are presuming a goal and a methodology to which to object, and I think Raph's research deserves critical engagement, rather than critical disengagement. I too admire EvB for making many of his own devices, and I also admire Raph for the same reason.]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I see two issues here. The first has to do with fairing being a procedure focussed on adjusting the structure of the contours rather than a procedure focussed on the structure of features or feature manipulation of the black of the letter or the white of the word particular to a distinctive letter form. The second having to do with process. 

I think any digital design is all about fairing, but what is fair for a jensonian typeface isn't necessarily fair for a bodoni. Jensonian fairness may perhaps tend toward the fairness generated by algorithm a, while bodonian or shinnsonian fairness might have a quite different but still characteristic algorithmic structure.

Rather than being asked about my preference, I'd rather be made aware of types of fairness, and how the fairing guided by the eye in actual type-design circumstances focussed on the shapes of strokes and counters might tend to algorithmically defineable types.</div>

<em>...you are presuming a goal and a methodology.</em>

Aren't you presuming to know what my thoughts are?
In fact I object to opinion polls on principle, whatever their goals and methodology may be.
My comments about "pure knowledge" were made after Raph introduced that idea to the discussion.

Yes, that's why I criticized this ad hoc opinion poll, rather than just jumping through the hoops, which would seem to me to constitute critical disengagement!

I guess. It is pretty common here. Ironically, I feel I need to speak up for common sense on occasion. To paraphrase a Douglas Adams quote about New Yorkers, if they did a list of the top 100 character attributes of Californians, common sense might sneak in at 79 (or so). There are much cheaper ways to get men's attention. Men are easy. Oops, did I give away the secret?

Agreed! Preference implies some sort of context that does not exist here. In addition, there is something squirrel-y about having an opinion of pictures of an expression, that are sections of a piece of a part. I mean, presumably this does have <em> something </em> to do with type design, somewhere along the line, here on Typophile and if so, having an opinion of pictures of an expression, that are sections of a piece of a part, with no context... what's next in this "study", our preferred off-curve point angle? Or perhaps the "best" gray between 90% and 96%? :)

Cheers!

		<div class="commentbody">As posts are added to a thread, one comes back to view it a number of times over a span of time, and personally, I find that each time I have looked at the series of curves above, my preference (actually, let's call it "the one I dislike the least"... ) is different. I don't think I'd be all that unique in experiencing that.  

What that suggests to me is that factors such as my mood at a given time, my level of alertness, if I'm wearing my reading glasses or not, or any number of other things are what is actually being measured and not my preferrence for one curve or another.

		<div class="commentbody">A few things. The term 'pure science' here is used to mean as opposed to applied science; the goal is true description and explanation, rather than practical application. However, true theories have immense practical application. There is nothing wrong with numerical description, if it is true. The advantage of quantitative description is that you can test it, and see if you are right or wrong. It is very difficult to capture complex phenomena quantitatively, but if you can do it, it is really powerful. For example the observed path of the planets through the sky is tremendously complex, but has been described mathematically. 

Second, in defense of Raph, he said that this was an exploratory trial to get a better idea of how to design the actual experiment. He isn't drawing any final conclusions here, but getting an idea of how to proceed. Hopefully, both the responses and the critique here will be somewhat helpful.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would go with 1.5, or perhaps, on reflection, 1. 0.5 clearly puts too much of the second derivative where the curve crosses the origin, and 4 clearly puts too much of the second derivative near the peaks of the function. Between 1 and 1.5, the curve's acceleration seems more evenly distributed.

After reading the responses, though, and finding out that 1 is based on the Cornu spiral, rather than any of the values corresponding to the sine curve, I suspect that doing a least-squares fit on your curve to a sine curve would be the way to optimize the parameter for the particular element to which I was assigning aesthetic value... but perhaps not, as the best fit to the sine curve might be a value above 1.5 - since an even distribution of subjective change in curvature might differ from what would seem the objective choice (since the derivative of sine is cosine, and so on forever).</div>
