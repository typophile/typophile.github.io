  gotham narrow medium, bold and light.\r\n\r\nI will need to replace gotham with
  a Unicode font to support:\r\n- English\r\n- French\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Chinese\r\n-
  Korean\r\n- Spanish\r\n- Italian\r\n- German\r\n- Portuguese\r\n\r\nNo foreseeable
  need for Hebrew or Arabic.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on fonts I can use, preferably
  with different weights?\r\n\r\nThanks, have a sweet day!\r\n"

  body: "thanks miguel! this is my 1st localization effort, and i had a pretty strong
    hunch 1 font wont do the job, happy you affirmed it. the challenge in this interface
    will be the possible existence of a few languages simultaneously at the same list
    .it's gonna be interesting... have a gooday!\r\n"
