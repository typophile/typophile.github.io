  for Tungsten]] H&FJ describe the style as a \"Modern Gaspipe\". I particularly like
  this style, with strong vertical lines, an explicit diagonal in the S and corners
  like a race track at the top and bottom.\r\n\r\nGoogling Modern Gaspipe doesn't
  yield much besides Tungsten. Does anyone know of some other good examples of this
  style, preferably with a lighter weight, such as [[http://www.virusfonts.com/fonts/bourgeois#characters-42|Bourgeois]]?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\nStephen"
