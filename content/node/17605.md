  across the term \"jobbing work / printing'. It is not the first time I have come
  across this term\u2014I have a fair idea of what it means. I would like to know
  exactly what it means, what type of work it refers to and involves.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  would be so kind as to enlighten me!\r\n\r\n\u2014K"

  body: As far as I know, it refers to small, run-of-the-mill printing or typesetting
    jobs, things like stationery, flyers, brochures, forms, etc.--the kind of thing
    you wouldn't necessarily hire a designer for.

  body: "Yes, jobbing work typically implies quick turn around work, often one-off
    for a client you may never see again. Print shops that offer 'design services'
    are engaged in jobbing work, but it also happens in the freelance world. If someone
    phones you up and says 'I need a business card design for a start-up company and
    I have a meeting with potential investors tomorrow morning', that would constitute
    jobbing work. So to some degree it is defined by the amount of time and creativity
    you can afford to apply to the job.\r\n\r\nIt happens in the type design field
    as well. Everyone once in a while I get a phonecall or email from someone who
    e.g. has a custom font that they have made themselves or someone has made for
    them, and they want to know why it looks like poo and whether I can do anything
    about it. Often the work is largely technical, e.g. fixing hinting or vertical
    metrics, but sometimes it involves adding new glyphs to existing fonts, which
    can be a challenge if the existing design is really bad: how you you achieve consistency?
    Sometimes these jobs turn into long term projects, with entire typefaces ending
    up being redesigned, but sometimes they arrive on a Friday and are gone on a Monday
    and the only further contact is when the cheque arrives. I tend to think of jobbing
    work as beer money."

    is just a sign of immaturity!\r\n\r\n\u2014K"

    who were around 'jobber' and that ususally denoted that they were more serious
    than the amateur and also earned part or most of their living actually 'doing
    it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\noh yes."
