  a folder of fonts that I had on my pc over to my mac, but they are all in the format
  pfb and pfm.. \r\n\r\nI googled it and found out that I needed the program Adobe
  Type Manager Light, so I went and downloaded that, but it has come in a weird format
  that wont open.. (the full filename for it is \"atm462.sit.hqx\")..\r\n\r\nDo you
  guys know what I need to do to get these fonts? From what I can gather, pfb and
  pfm are sort of zip formats.. Please correct me if i'm wrong!\r\n\r\nHappy Christmas
  also!"

  body: "Advo, the short answer is that you won't be able to use those fonts on your
    Mac. PFB and PFM files combine to make Postscript fonts on the PC. That format
    isn't supported by Mac OSX. \r\n\r\nYou're not completely out of luck -- PC TrueType
    (.ttf) and OpenType (.otf) files should work on your Mac simply by dragging them
    into one of the many Font folders.\r\n\r\nLots of useful info on Mac fonts, including
    which types are supported (and which folders you can use to make fonts active)\r\n\r\nhttp://images.apple.com/macosx/pdf/MacOSX_Font_TB.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n.hqx
    is the extension for BinHex files, a format that turns files into ASCII for easier
    transmission on the internet.\r\n\r\n.sit is the extension for StuffIt, a compression
    format that's popular on the Mac.\r\nhttp://www.faqs.org/faqs/macintosh/games-faq/section-4.html\r\n\r\n"

    X can't deal well with a lot of fonts on its own before stability problems start
    popping up. Since it comes with hundreds (almost 500 in the newest factory-installs!)
    to begin with, it's important to use a font management tool to handle your fonts,
    <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX\">Linotype's FontExplorer X</a>
    is free, seems to be the most stable app out there, and has some useful cleanup
    tools for when fonts go bad. Stay away from ATM\u2014it's old and being phased
    out, so when bad stuff happens with it you're just sort of screwed."

    are the apps that I use most often, Photoshop being the main one, so these would
    be the most usefull to have them in!!"

    a few pfm/pfb-fonts. I did what k.l. suggested, but no luck.\r\n\r\nI'm running
    leopard, I have the CS3 master collection, and I tried putting my fonts in \r\nLibrary/Application
    Support/Adobe/Fonts\r\nand that didn't work, so I put them in\r\nUsers/vandenb/Library/Application
    Support/Adobe/Fonts\r\n(The last folder didn't exist, so I created it.)\r\n\r\nI
    put the fonts in the Indesign font-folder and that worked, but, obviously, only
    for Indesign, and I really like them working for Fireworks...\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?
    Thanks in advance."

  body: "In the example you give, \"CB_____.PFB and _C_____.PFM\" you are describing
    a PFB for one font and a PFM for a different font. They should have identical
    file names except for the extension.\r\n\r\nThat aside, you have a more basic
    problem. The private Adobe fonts folder only enables fonts for applications that
    use the shared Adobe font engine. This includes InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop
    and AfterEffects (among others), but Fireworks is not part of that group. At least,
    not in the CS3 version.\r\n\r\nI don't know of any way, short of converting the
    font, to enable a Windows Type 1 font to work with Fireworks on Mac OS.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    want to use the font in Fireworks but in InDesign which according to other entries
    on this thread is indeed possible when placed in the above mentioned folder. Though
    I don't get the font in ANY of the CS applications (not even in InDesign when
    both files are placed within its own fonts folder) and I was wondering if there's
    any other reason for which they might not (e. g. they have to be of a certain
    \"version\", etc.).\r\n\r\nI'll look into the IIRC.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nEmiliano"
