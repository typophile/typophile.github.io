body: "Greetings all, and apologies if this topic has been covered in some place I
  haven't yet found. I'm working on a distressed textura font with an inline, and
  have been noticing a very vexing discrepancy between what I see on my screen and
  what comes out of the printer. I let FontLab automatically make numerous glyphs
  with international diacritics by compositing other glyphs, then decomposed them.
  Although they look identical on screen, coming out of the printer the decomposed
  glyphs appear to have suffered, for lack of a better term, \"dot gain.\" I'm attaching
  a sample to show you what I mean. The top row shows a screen grab of some lowercase
  os with diacritical marks in InDesign. The bottom row is the selfsame text as it
  emerges from my Phaser 6350 laser printer at 30pts, scanned at 1200dpi. The quality
  of the design and all other considerations aside, what troubles me is that the inline
  on the oacute, ograve and ocircumflex looks different than the one on the odieresis,
  even thought they are all printing from exactly the same Fontlab outline. They look
  the same on screen, but not on paper. Any ideas why this might be happening? And
  by extension if there's anything I can do about it?\r\n\r\n"

    the umlaut glyph is the correct one. \r\nIs your Phaser Adobe Postscript or a
    clone interpreter?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    body: "I thought it might be a superimposed second copy of the glyph too, but
      it isn't. Strangely, it seems to be happening to all the lowercase vowels, and,
      equally strangely, the ones with the dieresis seem not to be affected. \r\n\r\nI
      think the Phaser is Adobe Postscript, but I'm writing from home now and don't
      have it in front of me. If I'm wrong about that I'll post a correction tomorrow."
