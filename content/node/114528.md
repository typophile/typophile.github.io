  for writing an email like this , but today i recived a job that It's barely impossible
  for me to do because I don't have enough knowledge to figure out all the names of
  the fonts that appear in this image. When my college professor that assigned me
  this task, told me that there are 15 different types of fonts in this two headline
  blocks, I couldn't believe it . To be sincere I can only know the name of 2 or 3.\r\n\r\nCan
  you guys help me to IDENTIFY all the fonts?\r\n\r\nThank you very much. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Exercise_6287.jpg]"

  body: "If there are 15 different fonts, I would be surprised, but maybe that includes
    different weights of the same family? In any case, the image does not show the
    smaller fonts clearly enough to see their details. Is there another, better image
    you can point us to?\r\n\r\nFor example, the \"Spanien er belastet..\" serif is
    certainly not Capitolium News, but I can't tell if the e has a horizontal crossbar,
    what is the y tail like, or what the r serif looks like.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "By the way, if I had to guess what font \"Relato de un periodista..\" is,
    I would say Font Bureau [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Miller/|Miller]]. Or
    at least something in that family.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
