body: "Hey guys, got a new project I'm noodling on just for fun. I'm going to give
  a brief summary and then lead you through the process. I ask you if the concept
  is solid, and just need some reaffirmation that my head is screwed on straight.
  I also need your expert eyes for some final tweaks and refinements. \r\n\r\n<strong>Project
  Summary</strong>\r\n\r\nOk... so a buddy of mine is kind off a new age hippy dippy
  sort, and challenged me to come up with a company for him to sell these things called
  'binaural beats'. A Binaural Beat is created by playing two different frequencies,
  and when you hear them they make a rhythm \u2014 think dial tone. The idea behind
  these is that if you play different frequencies in each ear what your mind interprets
  in the middle will take you to a different state of mind, i.e: relaxed, meditative,
  or energized.  \r\n\r\nTo me it's snake oil - but i still thought I'd have a fun
  time branding snake oil for those co-op grocery granola yuppie yoga sort. \r\n\r\n<strong>Process</strong>\r\n\r\nFirst
  came up with the name Auralab - aural lab, aura lab.... <em>aura</em>lab... I liked
  it because it gives the brand legs incase he wanted to make things like yoga mats
  or something. I also liked the combination of the loosy goosey 'aura' and the scientific
  'lab'  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Auralab_Typophile_01_4001.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhen
  I started drawing the type I took this dichotomy very literally, creating organic
  cursive like hippy type for aura, and rectilinear structured letters for lab, and
  then merging the two with a cursive lowercase l... this was to reflect the idea
  of two frequencies. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Auralab_Typophile_a_6403.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut
  then I started to get interested in the shape created by the a,l...and i liked the
  idea of making the a look a bit more 'ear' like. This went on its own little tangent
  where I started to create a shape that was somewhere between a treble clef and and
  ampersand. I think this will be a very engaging icon, again sort of communicating
  that idea of combining frequencies.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Auralab_Typophile_03_3525.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  realized the type was getting too fussy and I simplified it while still maintaining
  that concept of having <em>aura</em> be italic and lab regular - i also made three
  different a's with the one in the middle being a love child of the two on either
  side, again subtly making a nod to that two frequencies being interpreted in the
  middle thing. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Auralab_Typophile_05_4003.jpg]\r\n\r\nFinally
  one last round of refinements made me take out the connecting swoosh between the
  a and l.... i thought it looked like a nut sack and couldn't see past it :-P \r\n\r\nfinally
  some stencil like cuts in the lab letters created a better rhythm and this is where
  I netted out with the type. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Auralab_Typophile_06_4793.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you guys think of <em>aura</em>lab ? \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    of the pre-stencil version, which would work also as a logo made with the initials
    of aura and lab)."

  body: "Thanks Riccardo, you definitely hit on a trouble spot with the first 'a'
    perhaps reading as an 'e'... I think I've refined it to a point where this is
    less of an issue \u2014 but I'm of course open to other solutions. \r\n\r\nHere
    is a higher Res Version of the logotype with some of the guides that I used. \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2Ppm2.png\r\n"
