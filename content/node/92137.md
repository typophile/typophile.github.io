  latest version of this (Windows) font editor includes an integrated auto-trace function.
  There is a video demonstration here:\r\n[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMqHCWKFz68]]\r\n(so
  if you are a Mac user you can see what you are missing)\r\n\r\n\r\nAllan Murray\r\n"

  body: The interactive tracing options shown in the video seem like a very good idea.
    Is it possible to batch process scanned letters? Or is it necessary to trace individual
    glyphs as shown in the video?

    body: "There is no batch processing (and no plan to add it at this stage) - so
      you do have to at least 'draw a frame' around each individual letter. The interface
      though, offers more options (if required) for each individual letter, or just
      for each image: scaling, black-white threshold, invert, upsample resolution,
      despeckle, input resolution to the tracer (controls number of output nodes)
      and a tracing parameter that controls sharpness/curvature of corners.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nice work. And as John says, the tracer is super. You should patent that
    ASAP because FontLab might pay you good money for it.\r\n\r\nBTW, a small pointer:
    it's best not to left-align the glyphs (and only having a right sidebearing).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I must be missing something here but ScanFont from FontLab does this all much
    quicker, with batch processing multiple glyphs to boot.

  body: "ScanFont doesn't have the interactive feedback in the filtering and trace
    functions, which are the attractive features here. I appreciate the batch processing
    in ScanFont, but being able to see what the results are going to be beforehand
    saves trial and error.\r\n\r\nAll this is sort of moot from my perspective, because
    I very seldom work from scanned images."
