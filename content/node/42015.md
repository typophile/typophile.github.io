  it off before they switched it to invite I get nauseous and feel like my life is
  incomplete.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone either have an account or know someone who can invite
  me? I can trade something! Plush toys, web design, Nestle candy, sewing, design
  magazines, books.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: Try <a href="http://weheartit.com/">We heart it</a>. Just launched. Same concept
    as Ffffound but arguably a more functional design, plus tags and comments. Here's
