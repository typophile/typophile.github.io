  body: Ahem. <BR> <BR>17. The quizmaster &#40;me, again&#41; reserves the right to
    disappear for extended periods of time to undisclosed locations and may not be
    required to reveal his whereabouts during this time or upon his return. During
    such times, general anarchy may reign on this thread, which should be understood
    as a salutary opportunity to execerise individual and collective responsibility.
    New rules may be invented during this time by any participant, and may enter into
    force by majority vote or popular acclaim. The quizmaster &#40;you know who&#41;
    reserves the right to overturn such rules on his return, but has enough faith
    in the anarchist project to hope that this will be unnecessary. Dancing is, of
    course, permitted.

    the Emigre  <BR>site - and perhaps influenced by Bill Troop&#39;s invectives  <BR>at

    a sort of unusable freak. But  <BR>when I saw it in print in the Emigre booklet
    &#40;which I  <BR>received only recently&#41; I began to quite like it. It&#39;s  <BR>a

    designer&#39;s work was featured. <BR> <BR>that makes no sense. there was an ad.
    it used a font. the font was designed by someone. <BR>in the ad, something in
    the background also pertains to something the font designer <BR>designed for.
    get it? name the type designer and the company the ad was for. <BR> <BR>what a
