  n Things and proceeds to open the packages . . .\r\n\r\nWe look down and see one
  of the cardboard inserts that holds the fabric stiff has some scrawls from a ballpoint
  pen on it but we can't make out what it says - I believe it's freehand Arabic cursive
  but can't be certain . . .\r\n\r\nSo I decided to open up this mystery to my fellow
  Typophiles to help us figure out what it says . . . Think you know? Let's all find
  out together shall we? :D\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help . . .\r\n\r\nStuart
