  born Arthur Eric Rowton Gill, on February 22nd, 1882 in Brighton, [[United Kingdom|England]]
  grew up to be a sculptor, engraver, stone-carver and type-designer. Gill\u2019s
  first formal training in the art of letterforms was in 1902, at the [[Central School
  of Arts and Crafts]] in London by type-designer and calligrapher [[Edward Johnston]]
  (designer of Johnston Sans for the London Underground).\r\n\r\nGill is very well
  known for his work as a type-designer, and throughout his career he produced a number
  of different types such as Perpetua, Gill Sans, and Joanna. After completion of
  a number of his types he wrote \u201CAn Essay on Typography\u201D (which touches
  on an even wider spectrum of topics than just typography), which is still being
  reprinted today. In 1940, Gill died in Uxbridge, and his gravestone lists him as
  a \u201Cstone-carver\u201D. Today many of Gill\u2019s typefaces are available in
  digital form from a number of different foundries.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Types\"></a><strong>The
  Types of Eric Gill:</strong>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Perpetua\"></a>[[Perpetua]] (1925)\r\n\r\nThe
  first typeface he designed for the Monotype Corporation. The typeface was developed
  based on some of the classic proportions and characteristics of the Trajan column.
  The miniscule letters of the face were designed to be in complete unison with the
  majuscule Trajan influenced forms. During the design process, Gill worked closely
  with [[Stanley Morison]] (Designer of Times New Roman) of Monotype Corporation.
  In 1929 a Greek version of Perpetua was designed.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"GillSans\"></a>[[Gill
  Sans]] (1928 \u2013 1930)\r\n\r\nProbably Gill\u2019s most well known typeface,
  and one of the most successful sans-serifs. The typeface was inspired by [[Edward
  Johnston]]\u2019s sans serif for the London Underground. Today Gill Sans in digital
  form is packaged with the Macintosh operating system.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Solus\"></a>[[Solus]]
  (1929)\r\n\r\nSolus was designed again for the Monotype Corporation and was another
  typeface somewhat similar to Perpetua. Many traits of this type are very much Egyptian
  inspired, particularly in the slab-like serifs, although they are far more subtle.\r\n\r\n<a
  name=\"Joanna\"></a>[[Joanna]] (1930-1931)\r\n\r\nAnother serif that Gill designed;
  it has been noted that it is one of Gill\u2019s lesser known faces despite its beauty.
  Joanna is said to be named after his daughter. The forms of the type are similar
  to Perpetua; however its stroke weight is much more monotone, the serifs are slab-like,
  and the ascenders scale up noticeably past the cap height.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"GoldenCockrel\"></a>[[Golden
  Cockerel]] (1930)\r\n\r\nThis typeface was designed for Robert Gibbings, who ran
  a print-house called Golden Cockerel Press. This was not a publicly released typeface;
  it was Gill\u2019s only production of a type exclusive for private press use. The
  typeface made its first appearance in A.E. Coppard\u2019s The Hundredth Story.\r\n\r\n<a
  name=\"Aries\"></a>[[Aries]] (1932)\r\n\r\nGill designed this type specifically
  for the Stourton Press; however a year later the type was cut by the Caslon Letter
  Foundry. The typeface has many resemblances to Times New Roman. There is a likely
  possibility that Stanley Morison was influenced and studies the forms of Aries when
  designing Times New Roman which also appeared in 1932.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Jubilee\"></a>[[Jubilee]]
  (1934)\r\n\r\nThis type was produced by Gill at the same time as he worked on Bunyan.
  The typeface is quite different than his others and is very calligraphic. Originally
  the typeface was called Cunard and in its first specimens it said that it was based
  on the calligraphy of Italian scribes in the 15th Century.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Bunyan\"></a>[[Bunyan]]
  (1934)\r\n\r\nThe type was very much similar to Gill\u2019s other type designs and
  made its first appearance in a new edition of Laurence Sterne\u2019s A Sentimental
  Journey. The typeface was released by Monotype, and later Linotype produced a version
  based of Bunyan which also included an italic (not designed by Gill) after his death.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sources:</strong>\r\n\r\nBrewer,
