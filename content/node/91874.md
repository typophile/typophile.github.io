    body: Thanks so much for that.  I think you have a very good point, but it appears
      that Neutraface is a relatively recent typeface and this particular signage
      dates back to 1960.  Any ideas on what that might be?  Perhaps this typeface
      inspired Neutraface?

  body: "Since both signs are fabricated metal, the letter designs don't necessarily
    have to match any existing typeface. Both could be based on different weights
    of Futura. The example at the top is close to Demibold, with the stance of the
    larger Rs widened a bit, and the numbers rendered as oldstyle figures.\r\n\r\nIn
    the example on the bottom (Book weight), the sign fabricator may have decided
    to use the crossbar of the A as the midline, thereby aligning the bottoms of the
    bowl for P and R, and the crossbars of the E and F. Note that the crossbar on
    the G is above the midline, which probably means that it wasn't altered.\r\n\r\nRichard
    Neutra will have to answer the question of whether or not this is the horse before
    his cart."

      just for fun since reading your reply.  \r\n\r\nI would never have thought that
      the artist who created both signs might have just taken his or her own artistic
      license with the typefaces.  Also, I contacted the postmaster of this office,
      and he's interested in finding the answers too.  Hopefully we can track it down,
      as I found out we both share an interest in government-sponsored art.  "

      had no idea other people were interested in this too before I found Typophile.
