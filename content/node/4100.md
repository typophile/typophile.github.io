  body: Very hard to see, but it looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/brush-script/brush-script/testdrive.html?s=Cole%2BTrickle&amp;p=72">Brush
    Script</a>, which is a very common default font for sign painters. <BR> <BR>&#40;No
    offense meant to artisan sign painters!&#41;
