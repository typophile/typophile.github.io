  \"How To Make {Almost} Everything\" there's a rather rugged looking sans used in
  many of the headlines as well as the book title; see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/ReadyMade-Almost-Everything-Do-Yourself/dp/1400081076/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1202704555&sr=8-1\"
  target=\"_blank\">book cover</a>.\r\nI've been mistaking this font for United Sans
  Regular but now I noticed the \"G\" has a stem \"beard.\" Does any know what font
  this is?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help. "
