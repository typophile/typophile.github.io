  body: "I went through the entire Bitmap font collection on Dafont and MyFonts, and
    there was no match, surprisingly. This doesn't seen radical, by any means, but
    I couldn't find a bitmap font to match.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to look at the
    Emigr\xE9 Lo-Res collection. Or else check the square techno fonts at Dafont.(At
    least those are free).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
