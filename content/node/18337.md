  new intel macs, but wanted to hear if FL5 runs under Rosetta? Has this been tested?
  Are there any plans for a universal binary? I couldn't find any info in the FL forums
  or FL site.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRandy"

    :)\"\r\n\r\nLikely not enough time has gone by to tell. Perhaps there are not
    many type designers using the newest systems with Rosetta. I would guess that
    type designers, being less than deep of pocket as a rule, don't jump on the latest
    hardware unless, like Randy, they have an unwelcomed breakdown in what they have
    been using. \r\n\r\nChrisL"

    it pause or lag?\r\nDoes it choke when generating Python results?\r\nAnything
    else?\r\n\r\nDue to travelling, I need a laptop I can run FLS5 on all day without
    snags.\r\nIt seems crazy to buy one of the old G4s.\r\n\r\nThanks so much."

    lags or chokes for me. But don't expect it to fly...\r\n\r\nI've upgraded to v5.0.2
    and so far so good. I did noticed a couple fixes.\r\nI've been doing a good amount
    of stuff with Python, most of which with Robofab, and no problems there either.\r\n\r\nI
    can't even remember the last time FontLab hung or crashed. But I'm one of those
    people that uses its most useful shortcut (Cmd+S), so take it with a little bit
    of salt."

    its equivalent) inherited from Basic programming on a Commodore-64 in the middle
    of a civil war where we'd lose electricity an average of twice a day. It's funny
    how old habits die hard: I received my new laptop yesterday, and in testing to
    see how the keyboard feels I instinctively typed \"RUN\"-Return and \"LIST\"-Return.
    I haven't actually needed to use those for like 20 years.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
