<div class=commentbody>I am creating two typefaces. The first one is posed above and it will be used as a base font for creating the second one. This typeface is needed to determine the proportions and the shape of my second typeface. Here is a sample of what my second typeface will look like, but it is still in progress. I will post it when finished. Comments and criticism on the first font and the beginning of my second one would be greatly appeciated. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27960.jpg alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>Kristin, this second one is more interesting. The first, as has been mentioned is rather close to Keedy Sans. There is nothing wrong, in my opinion, from referencing a font for proportions. But, perhaps you could post the rest of this second alphabet. </div>

<div class=commentbody>To answer all the Typophiles question, there are alot of people posting from our class. Since some of you are influencing the idea of type itoday why not get some of the most insightful minds critiqing some potential typographers. <br> <br>I second the Keedy Sans comment. It looks very similar, but the question I ask is why you showed the "base" type first, when you said your using the type as a proportional tool. Your inkblot look nothing like Keedy Sans or your base face, so there should not be a reason to give them more than a promience of inspiration. <br> <br>You can work with them together say like the Twin typeface by Letterror.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> there are alot of people posting from our class. <br> <br>Great! Typophile as a formal educational tool - super. <br> <br>BTW, it seems like your teacher (is it Josh?) has a strong -and positive- influence on you all, like in the way many of you are working on "layers" of form and such. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>For some people it is harder to grasp than others. Our professor put forth a fairly straight forward assignment and though it seemed foreign to many at first, I think everyone is coming around. They have to begin to understand that design is some you think about. Not just a colorful scarf you put on to add a splash of color. <br> <br>Also our professor is talking with Jared and I think many of our final posts will be moved to a new forum or special link within Typophile. <br> <br>Appreciate all the comments from all of you also. <br> <br>jp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey Kristin- It's been awhile since i've seen this typeface and it looks really sweet now. I was a bit skeptical of the rorshack (whatever) attempt so this comes as a great surprise. You'd never know those were from illustrator. One question: Did you have an action built into your typeface, like something that affected it from stage to stage? I can't remember. <br> <br>Rock on, <br> <br>-Mitch</div>
