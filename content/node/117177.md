    also available by RedRooster collection.\r\n\r\nAccording to myfonts.com:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/harry-pro/\r\n<blockquote>This
    revival of Harry is based on the original design by Marty Goldstein (and C.B.
    Smith).\r\nGoldstein, born in Chicago in 1939, was the co-founder of the groundbreaking
    Creative Black Book. He graduated from the Pratt Institute in 1960.\r\nHarry,
    first published by VGC in 1966, was named for his father. ITF has added four new
    weights to the original six.</blockquote>\r\n"
