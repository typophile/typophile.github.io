body: Hello, I'm new to this forum, but I would really appreciate some help in identifying
  this font. Here's an [[http://www.linedandunlined.com/wp-content/uploads/P1020110.JPG|example.]]
  It looks very close to Walbaum, but the serifs, particularly at the top of the lowercase
  a, and the spur of the lowercase r, are very sharp and pointy. It also has a very
  generous x-height in relation to its ascenders and descenders, giving the whole
  thing a streteched appearance. The example in the photo is from Alan Fletcher's
  The Art of Looking Sideways, where it appeared (at least to me) to be a reproduction
  that he'd included from some other source... That's all I know - thanks for your
  help!
