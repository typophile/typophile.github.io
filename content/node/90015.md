  body: "It looks like an \"L\". In French this is particularly\r\nbad since \"C\"
    and \"L\" are both often followed by an\r\napostrophe. In fact when I tried to
    read the quote\r\nI was wondering \"Is this French or not?\" for a few\r\nseconds,
    <em>then</em> I realized it's a \"C\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Oh I see your problem. You're right, obviously here the font deforms the
    first letter, but yes it's a C.\r\nif you want to know the quote is from Remi
    Gaillard, a french humorist.\r\n\r\nI simply look for the name of the font, I
    made some searches but any font I find looks like this one...\r\n"
