body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI need to make a logo with words: \"Team SHALVA\" as in #1 attached.\r\n\r\nIn
  #1 I used ITC Avant Garde Demi for the word \"Team\" and Futura Bold for the word
  \"SHALVA\".\r\n Together these fit the specifications I want but I need to find
  one font that does all those things.\r\n\r\nI would like:\r\n - An 'e' that finish
  with a flat edge\r\n - A very heavey font for the word \"SHALVA\" that looks a bit
  playful (as it does in futura but not in avant garde)\r\n - Possibly an S that ends
  with flat edges aswell, but only as long as this doesn't take away from its playfulness
  look\r\n - I would prefer an 'a' which is made of a semi-circle and a line (i.e.
  not the type of a in this font.. sorry I dont know the official name for that).\r\n\r\nI
  tried the same logo only in Avant Garde (#2) and only in Futura in (#3) but it doesnt
  achieve what I want.\r\nIn #2 - \"SHALVA\" is too rigid and possibly not heavy enough.\r\nIn
  #3 - The word \"Team\" has a bit too much variation of thick and thin in it and
  the \"e\" finishes at a slant.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggeest 1 font that will achieve
  all the things I want?\r\n (Helvetica = ok, but its not playful enough in the word
  \"SHALVA\" and it doesnt have the \"a\" I want).\r\n (Univers = ok but I dont like
  the different weights going on in the lowercase \"a\").\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fonts_6078.jpg]"
