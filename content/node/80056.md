body: "I am interested in purchasing this display face, GF Script No 5. The foundry
  is listed as Gigofonts in Slovenia. Their website address goes nowhere, and a Google
  search (cursory, I admit) is a dead end as well. I wanted to contact them about
  options for an expanded license/EULA that would allow use to use the typeface in
  an e-book (i.e. without converting to outlines). When a foundry dies, what happens
  to the EULA?\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gigofonts/gf-script-no-5/"

  body: Thanks! Obviously my Googling was TOO cursory. I am still interested in the
    hypothetical dead-foundry/EULA question. Has anyone encountered this?

    If I remember correctly, the consensus was that the EULA will be still binding."

title: Whither Gigofonts? or, does a EULA survive when a foundry dies?
