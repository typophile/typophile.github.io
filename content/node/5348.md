  <BR> <BR>There was an eight page insert in one of this week&#39;s SF <BR>Chronicle
  editions that featured a typeface that looked like <BR>Font Bureau&#39;s Eagle &#40;geometric
  &#34;A&#34; with low crossbar&#41; but lighter, <BR>like Futura but with taller
  proportions and a &#34;t&#34; with a curved stem at the bottom like Gill Sans. Can
  anyone ID this one? <BR> <BR>thanks in advance, <BR>Enrico

    target="_blank">Neutraface</a> using the alternate &#34;a&#34; and &#34;G&#34;
    characters. I couldn&#39;t find the alternate characters on the website, but they
    are shown in the printed brochures and match your sample.

    a petty, vindictive nitpicker, I think maybe Yves hasn&#39;t noticed that my I.D.
    was 41 minutes earlier.&#41;

  body: Actually, that typeface has Avenir-looking &#39;a&#39;s. <BR>Only the Italics
    have geometric &#39;a&#39;s. <BR>&#40;I just used LetterSetter at the House Industries
    site&#41; <BR> <BR>I was looking at some Bitstream faces at myfonts.com...still
    searching...any thoughts?

  body: Neutra has that a as an alt character, as was previously noted. I have a license
    for the face and just verified it in Illustrator.

    &#34;Futura-style&#34; which is used for this website. It is  <BR>definitely Neutraface,

  body: How is the alternate face accessed...is it in its own font with other alternate
    characters, or with a keyboard shortcut? <BR> <BR>thanks for all your help...I
    think this is my first time posting to this forum, much better than myfonts.com

  body: The alternate characters are a separate font for each weight of Neutraface
    Text and Display. Each shows separately in the font menu.
