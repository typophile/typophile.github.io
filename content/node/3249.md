  body: Most, if not all, foundries consider the address for which you licensed the
    type to be the location at which it should be used. So, if you license type and
    you want to use it at work, perhaps your boss should be licensing the type.  <BR>
    <BR>One workaround, of sorts, would be to find a foundry who supports the 60/40
    software clause &#40;I wish I knew the &#34;real&#34; legal term for this&#41;.
    Meaning, you license the type for your office address, but the license allows
    usage at another location. Even then this is sticky and gray, because most of
    these foundries also stipulate that it must be used for office work only. Therefore
    you wouldn&#39;t &#40;shouldn&#39;t&#41; use it for freelance work.  <BR> <BR>I
    have a terrible font addiction with which my boss cannot help me, so I&#39;ve
    found myself habitually licensing type. But, I license it to be used at my office
    location. I don&#39;t do freelance so it doesn&#39;t affect me.  <BR> <BR>I hope
    this helps. &#40;I&#39;ve moved it to the licensing area too. I hope that is okay&#41;

  body: 'Tiffany, do you happen to know some foundries which support this 60/40 thing?
    This could be relevant to couple of my clients, which have no real office and
    work mostly at their client&#39;s locations, but who still have a font to be used
    in the documents, presentations and stuff. <BR> <BR>Also, this is true about licensing
    a type to my boss and not to me, I just call it &#34;my type&#34;. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> That is what being done all the time lately. Another question
    in this relation is: if I buy a type on behalf of my client &#40;under my login
    at a foundry/shop&#41;, how do I &#34;license&#34; it to my client? I mean, I
    pay, I download, but I don&#39;t want to use it, am doing this just because I
    am &#34;such a nice guy&#34; and the real owner should be ABC Ltd. Co. KG GmbH
    SA.? <BR> <BR>My original question touched a bit different side of the question,
    though. For which jobs may I take typefaces from my boss&#39; library and for
    which job should I license a font to my client? If I make a logo with a font from
    my &#40;boss&#39;&#41; library - may I use it only inside the rooms I&#39;ve done
    it in, or may I sell it? :/'

  body: 'Alexey, I apologize for the delay. Let&#39;s make sure you and I are talking
    about the same thing. And before I forget you might watch for the upcoming issue
    of Interrobang, the magazine produced by <a href="http://typesociety.org/" target="_blank">SoTA</a>
    The Society of Typographic Aficionados. I&#39;ve written an article that discusses
    licenses, and comes with a useful chart that breaks down the more pertinent points
    found in type licenses. <BR> <BR>If you think of fonts as being similar to royalty
    free photography you are on the right track. Sort of. This is to say that most
    font licenses, if not all that I can think of &#40;Nathan!&#41;, can be used without
    question on logos, booklets, ads, billboards, posters, pads ... most printed material,
    if not all. On the other hand, if your work allows embedding of any kind you really
    really &#40;I can&#39;t stress this enough, and I say this to everyone&#41; need
    to read the license from the foundry you plan to license type BEFORE you do the
    actual licensing. Why? Because some foundries have extremely &#40;in my opinion&#41;
    restrictive clauses concerning embedding. And most, if not all, have such clauses
    in their licenses. Some of the more generous licenses are <a href="http://emigre.com/"
    target="_blank">Emigre</a>, <a href="http://stormtype.com/" target="_blank">Storm</a>,
    and <a href="http://shinntype.com/" target="_blank">ShinnType</a>.  <BR> <BR>Your
    questions raise all kinds of red flags. If you are at home, I&#39;ll assume this
    is the address at which you&#39;ve licensed your personal library of fonts, you
    can use these fonts for your freelance/personal work. If you are at home doing
    jobs for your boss, legally, your boss should also have a license of these fonts,
    because in the end your boss will be paid for the final job. But again, this is
    a red flag. In my opinion, and I hope the real type people speak up on this, if
    you are doing something like a logo, where the actual font software will never
    need to be transferred, I would think it is up to you if you want to allow your
    boss this advantage. <BR> <BR>If I were you I would do my best to separate my
    home &#40;work&#41; from my office &#40;work&#41;. Meaning, your boss should be
    licensing the type that he needs at his location, full stop. If this is happening,
    and for instance home &#40;you&#41; and office &#40;boss&#41; both have licenses
    for Amplitude there can be no confusion.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m in an interesting position
    at my office. I don&#39;t have a home computer, nor do I do freelance. But, I
    have such an awful type licensing habit that I have a different icon on the fonts
    which I&#39;ve licensed versus those that my boss has licensed for me to use.
    So, when I move on I will transfer those licenses to my next address. I wouldn&#39;t
    suggest this to anyone. If this is your situation, you need to develop a relationship
    with your boss that won&#39;t make this messy when you leave.  <BR> <BR>Alexey
    said:  I mean, I pay, I download, but I don&#39;t want to use it, am doing this
    just because I am &#34;such a nice guy&#34; and the real owner should be ABC Ltd.
    Co. KG GmbH SA.? <BR> <BR>Your client should only have to pay for a type license
    if they need to use the type at their address. You can however, include within
    your invoice/bill to them the price of licensing the type for their project which
    you did at your address. Does that make sense? <BR> <BR>If you are paying for
    font licenses under your login &#40;which means your address&#41; and then giving
    the fonts to your clients, this is wrong. You will have to contact FontShop to
    see if you can transfer the licenses to the clients. Luckily, FontShop does allow
    license transfer, not all foundries do. <BR> <BR>Alexey asked:  Do you happen
    to know some foundries which support this 60/40 thing? <BR> <BR>One such foundry
    is Linotype. Their license states: &#34;If the Font Software is intended to be
    used for commercial purposes, each individual license permits one additional usage
    &#40;installation&#41; on a personal home or portable computer.&#34; <BR> <BR>I
    hope this helps.'

    yet read through your whole post, Tiff, but on this count I believe you&#39;re
    thinking of AGFA|Monotype and P22 &#40;and maybe others&#41; that have clauses
    in their licenses that restrict the use of their fonts as &#34;principle art&#34;
    in derivative work. To my mind, that means no logos and other such things that
    use their type. <BR> <BR>Then there are foundries like Emigre, House, LucasFonts,
    et al. They all have some sort of clause in their licenses that stipulate that
    you have to credit them in certain instances. '

  body: Ah yes. Thanks for jogging my memory Nathan. <BR> <BR>Derivative work is very
    confusing. When the clause states &#34;principle art&#34; they are thinking about,
    more or less, the object/design cannot stand on its own merit. For instance. Some
    foundries might disallow the use of their font &#40;whether letter or dingbat&#41;
    as artwork on a tshirt or coffee cup. It also means the act of slightly changing
    the font and then reselling it as your own. Most foundries don&#39;t allow this,
    and if at all you must purchase a different license to do so. <BR> <BR>However,
    all of that said, derivative work does not have anything to do with logos. But,
    that is a gray area in my mind. What if I used the capital D from ITC Bodoni 72
    as a logo for a company. And then put it on a tshirt for the client? Would it
    only become derivative work if the client wanted to resell the tshirt?

  body: Tiffany, Nathan, <BR> <BR>thanks for the tips. All these licenses are really
    misleading in some way - as a &#34;normal&#34; client, that buys fonts, I would
    actually expect to be quite free in my usage of the type, as far as I don&#39;t
    change glyphs or rename and sell it &#40;or just resell without any other credits
    or rights&#41;. Not to use a font in a logo is in my opinion way too restrictive
    and unlogical. But whatever. <BR> <BR>The situation I am in is even more perversed.
    As the company where I work was starting out, the guys asked me to bring my computer
    with me &#40;I was starting here as a kind of freelancer&#41;. These days I am
    working here full-time and still on my personal computer. All type bought in these
    years &#40;either by myself or by the company&#41; is installed on my machine.
    And this is PC, not Mac, so I can&#39;t really mark the fonts I own and the fonts
    I don&#39;t own with different icons. :/ <BR> <BR>Anyways, questions continue.
    Say, if I buy a font, as a private person, and one day a client wants to use this
    font &#34;just once&#34; for his booklet or... website or... printed ad. Does
    the client have to buy the font or can I use it, as it belongs to me anyways?
    This might be easy to derive from your answers, but I just cannot see the concept
    clear enough. <BR> <BR>The reason I ask is quite simple. I have a <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/">chance</a>
    to pick couple of fonts and am thinking of their future usage. I have my personal
    favourites, but I am not sure, if I am able to use them in the near future for
    the upcoming jobs. On the other hand there are fonts that I would never use for
    my stuff, but that could serve some logo/headline/short text goals. So I am hesitating...

    <BR> <BR>I think type designers should spend more time marketing their type and

    as metal, and no amount of legal pontificating is going to make people treat it
    that way. <BR> <BR>It sounds like the type design industry should move toward
    rights managed licensing. It might be a good paradigm shift. It would allow more
    flexibility in licensing. It will also fill the gap between commissioned corporate
    type and commercial type. <BR> <BR>Then maybe the typographic exclusivists would
    be happy, and spend even more time thinking about all the tricky ways they can

    think that this is actually one reason for the licenses being such a pain in the
    &#149;&#149;&#149;. Because when I use metal type, I&#39;m using type that I actually
    <i>own</i>. Whereas with digital, I don&#39;t own anything.  <BR> <BR>E.g., I
    can file a metal &#39;f&#39; down to make a kern, but sometimes EULAs don&#39;t
    allow the same sort of modifications. <BR> <BR>Likewise, I can sell a case of
    metal type to whomever I chose, but not every EULA allows you to transfer the
    license to someone else &#40;which is dumb IMHO&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think that everything
    is a hell of a lot simpler with metal. Unfortunately it&#39;s obsolete for all
    practical intents and purposes. As Gerald Giampa pointed out in another thread
    &#40;can&#39;t find it though&#41;, metal type was also a <i>lot</i> more expensive
    for a full range of sizes with ligatures, small caps, etc. <BR> <BR>Lesser of
    two evils, I guess. Luckily there are some foundries that give the user quite
    a bit of freedom. When I license type, I try to license it from them.'

    Software is difficult this way. However, when we license, we are purchasing the

    that is attached that makes it difficult. I&#39;m with Nathan on choice of foundry.
