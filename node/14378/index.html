First challenge: the "g" in Matrix.

Let's see what you got guys! And girls. The winner
gets a free license to some font. Or something.

But of course just show the new glyph (maybe in
a word) don't go passing around derivative fonts!!
And if you don't have the font, use a rendering
from MyFonts or something.

		<div class="commentbody">I know she is (or at least used to be) your biggest idol, but that doesn't make her infallible. But anyway, this isn't about her, it's about how to improve a font, in this case how to fix the Achilles Heel of an otherwise wonderful design. Designers do that all the time to existing fonts, even to those by people who are not dead yet. Of course you don't have to participate (just like you never help out in the critiques - and I know exactly why, don't you doubt it - I'm just playing nice) but please don't discourage others; those of us who are here to learn can gain a lot from such an exercise. Heck, with some fancy coding an end-user could conceivably get a much more usable font out of the process even!  :-)

A font is not a painting.

Hrant, perhaps the reason I don't "help out" is that you would take the opportunity to trash whatever I said. I don't know why I bother opening my mouth on Typophile, every time I do you jump down my throat.</div>

http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/tester.php?fontstyletoken=Amplitude-Regular&fontsize=36&text=ugly@amplitude.com

The "@" in Amplitude.

I absolutely love this typeface and others by Christian Schwartz, but I think the "@" could have been done a lot better. I think it looks out of place compared with the rest of the characters in the family. Possibly because the stroke of the loop around the "a" is so much lighter than the other characters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, that is pretty bad. Plus an At with a binocular "a" in the middle is too distracting I think; the "normal" form with the mono "a" allows the character to be more itself - which would be an easy fix.

Nobody's "man" enough to tackle the "g" in Matrix?  :-)

For a mono though I think it works, except that
the terminal is coming too close to the bowl.
In situations like this it's not unacceptable
to lift the bowl off the baseline a bit.

		<div class="commentbody">To me, Matrix is what it is. If you go changing it, it's not quite Matrix anymore. But if you want to engage in revisionist type design, I'm game. André asked me to comment on his solution. It's a nice looking g and does pick up on Matrix's design elements, but loses some of its essential mechanical quality. I would redo it more like this:

I've tried to keep the basic design similar to the original, but I've shifted the proportions and weight around a bit. In doing so, I think it feels more comfortable in its surroundings, but has lost some of its iconoclasm.</div>

It's interesting trying to walk the line between a very text like understucture and the ornamental serifs. 

BTW - My crit of what I have seen so far is that the examples don't have the sparkle of matrix. They are nice letters but they don't seem in keeping with the spirit of the face. You might disagree with that spirit on some level - but a replacement g needs to fit in with it's neighbors - no?</div>

Looking at my 3 again I should maybe comment that the 3rd one was an attempt to keep the feeling matix-y which yeilded a surprise. The surprise being that 3 looked like a g at all! I thought it was neat-o. But I actually don't think any of the examples I posted are real solutions. They are just sketches/experiments. They didn't do what I expected either!

I'm thinking that closing the bottom might in fact be a good idea here. But now it's leaning all kinds of funny. Why not reduce the angle of the diagonal? Of all the ones I've seen so far I think this has the most potential.

Well, OK. So name the rose with its errant petal tamed something else if you like. But the point and purpose remain.

Mark, I think your angle is not without merit, dealing with "micro" improvements while leaving the existing character of the design as unaltered as possible. But I have to doubt that if it gets rid of the distracting "spike" in texture that was the original complaint (at least on my end). I think in every other way Matrix can be a text face (or at least come very close).

> This hardly took half a minute

I think it has an elegance. I'd just lift the bowl off the baseline a tad.

		<div class="commentbody">I say this speaking from the point of view of a graphic designer - I think what made matrix so popular in it's day was it's energy openess & brightness. It's has a can-do feeling. It's very california. Optomistic in character. I really like Mark's most recent effort because it maintains these qualities. In some ways his new g fits better than the old one! My only quibble/crit would be that the left side of the bottom bowl feels a tiny bit wonky. 

> To me, Matrix is what it is. If you go changing it, it’s not quite Matrix anymore.

Yes, I agree. But your 'g' make for a better matrix than matrix! At least for texts. Advertising might be another issue. And Matrix, to be fair, wobbles between text & display  - no?

Sim (Andr) , Your g's, while excellent in their way, don't seem to fit as well as mark's to my eye. I feel as if I am seeing a 'g' from a page of a pulp novel. It's too scotch-ish I think... Maybe that last part is wrong. The angled terminal is part of the reason I think this. It has no similar feature to draw on in the face so it jumps out. But the real reason I like it it less is the slanted angle of the lower bowl. I think if it were straight I would like it better. Still, they are impressive! 

Just my usual 35 cents...</div>

I think both Mark's and sim's latest attempts are getting close, and in nicely different directions. I agree with Eben that sim's glyph is somewhat out of character (although the new ear helps). I can think of two things that should help: an angular join between the two bowls; and/or a straight top part to the bottom bowl. Also, I might try to make the bottom bowl open (after all). As for Mark's, I think the midsection might just be right on, but: 1) Maybe it's all not "round" enough. Should the head be smaller and the bottom bowl more full? 2) The left of the bottom bowl is totally out of character. Maybe just leave it open - and just like the original? Or turn the triangle terminal towards an "upcurl", instead of having it lay flat? I think sim tried something like that before.

		<div class="commentbody">Cheers Eben! I just fiddled for a few minutes till it 'looked right'. I wouldn't be able to tell at all how effective and appropriate it is until Isaw it in extended text. Like you I am not a huge fan of Matrix. But this throws up two things:

1) I find that if I don't initially like something that, on good authority, is supposed to be good then I end up liking it through repeated exposure and time. Especially with music, when it immediately appeals to me it has severely limited longevity.

2) I think I remember Hrant saying something about text faces having to have an inherent 'ugliness' to them in order to remain effective at smaller sizes. I think there is some truth to this, and Matrix to me is rather ugly. But only large, which doesn't really count. I used to be repulsed by Antique Olive as well, but now I love it! 

How bout that for a rave?

But if a second challenge is desired, there's always my post

Yet another one might be the lc "f" in the original metal Sabon

And then there's the "a" and "r" in Stone, with their sickly, cloying

BTW, there's really no reason to limit it to one choice. The only thing I personally think people should mind would be to draw the glyph from scratch and not cannibalize contours from the original.

Personally, I think Kris's is the best so far (considering it fits so well with the rest of the font). The main thing I would change is make the connection between the top bowl and the join a bit thicker.

> Like this?

Looking great.
I'd just make the right side of the link totally vertical.
BTW, that ear is genial - I would've never thought of it.

Also:
I was going to suggest that you loosen the right sidebearing, but then I realized another dimension to this: ideally we want any replacement glyph to be uniwidth with the original. Can you work with that?

> I don’t see anything fundamentally wrong with the Perpetua ‘d’.

Well, chirographers hate it. But of course that is -or at least should be- moot. I however do have a problem with it myself: I think it causes a too-prominent spike in texture. I've actually caught myself stumbling on it during reading. On the other hand, it's certainly an "inspiring" glyph, and has played a role in Patria's "d".

> What about changing other glyphs to match, like the ‘a’?

Heyyyy, now that's an idea. That might result in: a more display-like cut; or actually making the "d" no longer ruin the texture! Go with it man.

What is a 'Note Ere'? As in 'Not here'? That may be a little too grand. Thats alot of folks to have an interest - let alone a negative one.

I agree about the sidebearing.

I'm not a Vendetta kind of guy. Don't scare people away with your self-serving imagination. In fact, ever since RvL graciously apologized to me for what some people associated with Emigre tried -and failed- to do to me, I've actually been helping them out more than pointing out their flaws. When I see something good (like Tarzana) I freely point it out. When I see something bad (like the "Q" in Tarzana) same thing.

I'm not giving you any special treatment. But I used to.
(I sincerely hope you can figure out what I just wrote.)

I chose Matrix because the contrast between its overall merits and that ludicrous "g" is greater than any other case that comes to my mind. The idea for this thread popped into my head when somebody in another thread trashed Matrix outright. But I'm not fixated on Matrix, I really do just want to teach/learn. So feel free to suggest another font that's marred by a single (or two) horrid glyphs. And I don't mean you in particular, because anybody who refuses to crit fonts -for the reason I believe you harbor, the same reason you're defending Matrix, and the same reason you turned frigid when Eben suggested you provide some Eunoia glyphs for public modification- is unlikely to participate in this thread... except of course to sabotage it. Who's jumping down whose throat again?
