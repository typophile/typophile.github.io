  body: 'All seems pretty reasonable. <BR> <BR>One small quibble: the glyph name should
    probably be f.terminal instead of f_terminal. <BR> <BR>Some typesetting engines
    may break the text run at the end of a word, but failing that, your &#39;calt&#39;
    solution should work. You could even make the context depend on the existence
    of a problem letter after the space character. <BR> <BR>feature calt { <BR>sub
    f&#39; space [b h k l B D E F H I K L M N P R U V W X Y Z] by f.terminal ; <BR>}

  body: Thanks. <BR> <BR>Is the covention to use the period with a glyph variant of
    a character, and the underscore with a ligature? <BR> <BR>BTW, you&#39;d have
    to add quoteleft and quotedblleft to the &#34;problems&#34; list. <BR> <BR>Charles
