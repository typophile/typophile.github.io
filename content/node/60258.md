  body: "yes I mean traditional punchcutting, not using matrices.\r\nI had read this
    quote, \"Bertha herself, for example, cut their 24-point Deepdene italic design...\"
    but  the book \"Bertha S. Goudy First Lady of Printing\", explains she used the
    pantograph to engrave matrices. So that excludes her.\r\n Can't find any reference
    for Gundrun Zapf Von Hesse ...any  suggestion for source material?\r\nThanks"

  body: "Then I think you will be hard-pressed to find woman cutting punches. \r\n\r\nThe
    general acceptance of women into the workplace coincides roughly with the general
    decline of actual punchcutting in favor of the pantographic matrix-cutting machine.
    Even then, you are much more likely to find women in the drawing offices than
    operating the machining equipment. Bertha Goudy was an exception to this, since
    the Goudys were essentially a small family, cottage business.\r\n\r\n[[http://markbattypublisher.com/|Mark
    Batty Publisher]] has a book on the work of [[http://markbattypublisher.com/books/gudrun-zapf-von-hesse/|Gudrun
    Zapf von Hesse]]. She was wife of Hermann Zapf and a respected type designer in
    her own right. \r\n\r\nBut it's not in that specific context that you're likely
    to find her cutting punches, if at all. She was also an accomplished book binder.
    In that endeavor, she undoubtedly used punches for spines and covers. \r\n\r\nAs
    Michael suggests, she may have cut her own punches for that work. I don't know
    if this is true or not, and I don't know if the above-cited book would touch on
    such details or not. If she did cut such punches, I doubt these would have been
    used for any production of type as we know it, so I don't know if it falls completely
    within your criteria.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n "
