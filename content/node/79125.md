  and found that what I need was Myriad. I have The Design Premium CS5 Set, and it
  came with the Content disk. So fire up the ol' Photoshop and start typing. I come
  across this problem: Everything looks fine...but the apostrophe looks different
  than what it's 'suppose' to be. And I can't even check if I could use another as
  substitute, 'cause most of the others come up as boxes.\r\n\r\nAnd to show you,
  here's some screengrabs. The first is my type in CS5, the second is from MyFonts.com,
  and the final is a screengrab from Adobe's own store. I'm at a complete loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    aware that an apostrophe being typographically correct resembles the shape of
    a tiny \u201C9\u201D. Using an US keyboard on a Mac, you\u2019d enter an apostrophe
    using alt-shift-]. The \u201Cother\u201D apostrophe (next to the return key) is
    actually a different symbol (as used in measurements, such as 5' 11\" for instance)
    .</li>\r\n<li>Of the examples you are showing, only the first one uses a \u201Ccorrect\u201D
    apostrophe for the context. Some applications, such as MS Word (and maybe also
    Photoshop) try to intelligently replace ' by \u2019 while typing.</li>\r\n<li>Myriad
    does not have a very \u201C9-resembling\u201D apostrophe, but you can clearly
    see the direction, as opposed to examples 2 and 3.</li></ol>\r\n\r\nSo I suppose
    you\u2019re all set, and everything\u2019s fine! :)\r\n\r\nHere are some more

    the unicode. Sadly, a lot of the punctuation are blocks, but the one I needed
    wasn't, so it's all good. For now."

    and type 0146 with the numpad.\r\n\r\nMore reference here:\r\nhttp://alt-codes.org/list/"
