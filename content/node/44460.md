  body: "Which one? This one:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Erik'sGN2_6569.cropped.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlthough
    it's almost certainly obvious; T Bone's image not of GN; it is of course a Hollywood
    movie monster -  Frankenstein.\r\n\r\nI actually liked the B&W one too.\r\n\r\nBTW:
    If anybody has a better image I am still open to a new one. An Image of Akira
    Kobayashi would be fine to have too. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
