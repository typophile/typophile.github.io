  Our audience is higher level managers, CEOs, CFOs, etc. I've been told to keep design
  of the paper \"BMW\" - upscale, high-quality, intelligent ...\r\n\r\nI'm feeling
  a bit overwhelmed in doing font research - there's so much out there! Any suggestions
  for headline and body fonts to check out? I'm thinking serifs, preferably ones with
  lots of options - bold, italic, maybe even ones with sans serif versions."

    typographica.org ... lots of good stuff to choose from, but just having a hard
    time sorting through it all. \r\n\r\nI like Meta a lot, but am wondering if it's
    \"business-y\" enough. I may play around with it a bit."

  body: German it is not, but a Scotch is all business. Old money and lots of it.
    Blended to perfection in [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100032|four
    grades and loads of garnishes.]] Don't combine it with a sans, go text and display
    and you'll hear the bagpipes wail.
