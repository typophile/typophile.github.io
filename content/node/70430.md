  body: It does not work. The tail is in disharmony with the font, the changes of
    the stroke width look arbitrary and the tail breaks the connection between the
    R and the rest of the word. Except from that it somehow looks more like a P with
    a tail.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nI'm definitely no typography expert, so I
    appreciate your educated opinion.  I do find that most Rs, especially ones with
    swashes, end up looking like Ps with tails if you stare at them for long enough.
    \ Anyway, I've studied some other examples and tried again with my swash.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also curious as to what you think of combining serif and sans-serif faces in the
    Riverland word.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo4_4225.png]"

    the tail is not in harmony with the rest of the R, the eye disconnects both parts.
    The second tail is slightly better, but it still does not work.\r\n\r\n<cite>I'm
    also curious as to what you think of combining serif and sans-serif faces in the
    Riverland word.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhy do you think, that splitting the word could
    improve the look? Why do you want to drag attention to the meanings of river and
    land? And if you use a sans serif and a serif for two parts of a word, the one
    font really should like the other. But the difference should be clearer. And therefore
    you can additionally change the contrasts between the fonts in such a couple word
    by choosing another weight or another color for one of the fonts. But here it
    is a bad idea. The whole thing looks cobbled together."

  body: "I think you can make the /R/ with a swash look alright, it will just take
    a lot of work to get it perfect. Editing letterforms is no small task. I would
    say do not mix the serif/sans, as the first logo looks wayyy more cohesive than
    the second. It just needs a bit of kerning as \"River\" seems way more tracked
    out than \"land.\"\r\n\r\nHere's an /R/ with a swash I've done in the past, and
    it took forever. I considered swooping the /R/ all the way through the logo, but
    it was just too much, so I kept it really tight within the rest of the logo: http://www.studioimbrue.com/images/portfolio/trattoriarustica/1.jpg"

  body: The weights of the serif and sans are too similar to be effective. It looks
    unintentional, as if you forgot to change the font for the second half of the
    word. Id up the contrast in type choice and weight if you're going for a one-two
    punch phonetically.

  body: "The new swash is better, but still way too dark/thick. This is because the
    bottom edge has more of an 'S' shape than the top edge does.\r\n\r\nI also agree
    with Arno that setting \"Riverland\" in two different typefaces splits the word
    up and emphasizes the two separate meanings of \"river\" and \"land\". I would
    not do this.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "i like it!\r\nif there's any problem at all it's not the intention to do
    this type of the descender thing maybe proportions but overall this looks nice
    for me. maybe the descending stroke needs a little adjustment - tad thinner, and
    contour adjustment just a bit\r\ni like extra ascender / descender thing of ordinary
    alphabets... and i think it has to be experimented a lot to break out of everyday
    patterns and to come up with new stimulis.. i especially like decorative, curvy,
    extended strokes in contrast with something more straightforward and conventional
    - it creates a nice contrast.. sometimes i even want to do the extended thing
    for y, f lol\r\n\r\nhave a nice day\r\nhun"

  body: "Why does it have to have two visual tweaks - the swash of the R and the two
    type styles? It's too complicated, simple as it may look.\r\n\r\nI would go back
    to the concept: does a hearing clinic need a classic type treatment? Then do it
    so with proper swash characters and/or maybe small caps. Try Poetica. Or does
    it have to be a little hi-tech? Try mixing a modern or neoclassic with a light
    neo-grotesque sans."

  body: I think it's better to keep everything serif for better unity. Furthermore,
    the problem with the R is that it stands out to much. I would make that swash
    continue in the right diagonal of the v and create a small gap between the swash/right
    diagonal and the left diagonal. The second swash is the one you should work with.
