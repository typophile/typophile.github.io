    <BR> <BR>And why does Microsoft, with all its money, resort to this?

    hand, I do have the common sense to recognize a rat when I see one. I&#39;ve personally

  body: 'Microsoft, Agfa Monotype and Linotype are discussing the Segoe/Frutiger issue.
    <BR> <BR>I think MS commissioned the new types in good faith: they certainly didn&#39;t
    ask for a Frutiger clone &#40;indeed, they already license Frutiger Linotype for
    the MS Reader, and have no need for a clone&#41;. Agfa Monotype deny that Segoe
    is an intentional Frutiger clone, but most people I&#39;ve spoken to seem to agree
    that, whatever AM&#39;s intent, the result is too similar to Frutiger for comfort.
    In this respect, I don&#39;t think it matters much, certainly not to MS, whether
    it is an intentional copy or not: the possible PR damage from something that large
    numbers of people think looks like a copy is reason enough to be concerned.'

    this has happened with Arial, Book Antiqua and now Segoe. Do you really know that
    when Microsoft commissioned the new types in good faith that they did not realize
    what they would be getting? <BR> <BR>Also from which sector&#40;s&#41; is the
    PR damage potentially coming from? <BR>

  body: Frutiger is a much beloved typeface known and used by lots of professional
    graphic designers, many more of whom are now Windows users than when Book Antiqua
    hit the personal computer. MS are justifiably concerned about what might written
    about them in a wide circulation design mag like Print or Communication Arts,
    especially since negative stories tend to travel. Even the utter stupidity of
    the claim that Wingdings contains hidden antisemitic messages made it to the New
    York Times. <BR> <BR>I happen to know for a fact that a lot of people at MS are
    very concerned about the Segoe/Frutiger issue, and are working to resolve it.
    I wouldn&#39;t be saying anything in this thread if all I had to offer was speculation.
    I work with these people.
