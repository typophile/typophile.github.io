body: "I'm currently rounding up the design of a custom font I've been working on,
  called <a href=\"http://www.characters.nl\">Siventi</a>. I want to go and set up
  a licence agreement for the usage of the font. The client wants to have the licence
  forever, but will not pay that much for it. I will keep all the rights on distributing
  the font. In the future it might be so that other companies working for Siventi
  will need to have the font. They will then buy it from me and that money is mine
  to have. But that is Mickey Mouse-money, really.\r\n\r\nSince I've never did this
  before or licenced a font myself, I would like to ask if there is anyone willing
  to share a licence agreement with me. Since this is a custom licence I guess the
  standard EULA is not enough. \r\nI don't know if this is something you wish to keep
  a secret. I hope not. You would really help me a lot with this. \r\nI don't need
  to know anything on pricing, but just want to get the contract in order.\r\n\r\nWe
  can make a trade? I'll give you one of my fonts for free. Just pick any you want...
  \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9"

  body: "That's way too lame of an agreement. You should have a laywer draft a proper
    document. Custom font licenses are no place for do-it-yourselfers. As a point
    of reference regarding trade, you will have to pay an attorney between $1000 and
    $3000 to draft for a proper license. You can then reuse it on all your custom
    work. Do you have that much to trade?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I am not interested in
    any trades, just to be clear. I'm just offering an opinion."

  body: "James, I definitely have not that kinda money to have an attorney draft a
    proper license for me. I don't even have the paying customers yet that makes it
    worth while having a good license made. \r\nI just thought these kind of contracts
    were 'standard' and most people use them like that. I would also not go to a attorney
    to have him set up a EULA for me, because they are almost all the same. You can
    personalise and finetune it, but to have an attorny make it from scratch?\r\n\r\nThe
    trade was just a trigger to see if anyone would react to my question. I've realised
    that on Typophile everyone is very willing to help out when it comes to the actual
    technical construction of the fonts. But when it comes to more commercial questions,
    the willingness to be open and helpfull becomes smaller. \r\nI can understand
    that you should be carefull with giving out prices to potential competition, so
    I don't ask for that. This also depends on the clients demands, speed, quality,
    service, etc. of the typographer in question.\r\nBut helping eachother to get
    set up with finding the right foundries, contracts & licenses, copyrights, etc,
    are for me just as important then to get that particular glyph right. \r\n\r\nI've
    made a similar experience at the Art Academy where I studied. They teach you everything
    you want to know about design, but nothing that you need when you want to work
    outside their ivory walls. Businesswise they didn't teach us anything. \r\nMe
    and a friend started even while studying at the academy with our own studio. I
    can't tell you how many mistakes we made, because we just didn't know. Over 75%
    of these mistakes were unnccesairy if someone had just helped us out. The studio
    is now 10 years old and we're doing really well. But it could have been a lot
    easier.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Also tired of Helvetica?</strong>

  body: "I appreciate that you don't have the funds for an attorney to draft your
    license, but I have to disagree that all licenses are more or less standard. At
    TypeCon in NY, Frank Martinez (a lawyer specializing in licensing, contracts and
    IP) made the case that EULAs and any type of font license are really a intergral
    component of the type makers business plan. I don't think every type make has
    the same business model, so I don't think every license will be standard.\r\n\r\nAt
    TypeCon NY, Bruno Steinert of Linotype offered anyone who wanted to, the freedon
    to copy LinoType's EULA, perhaps there is where you should start."

  body: "I agree. That's what I meant with 'standard', so I guess I didn't explain
    myself clear enough. With standard I mean that some paragraphs would/could be
    the same as others, but then you have to put your own business plan in (finetune
    it). \r\nYou don't have to invent the wheel completely new, but make sure that
    you have the right tires on it.\r\n\r\nMost of my fonts are sold through other
    foundries, so I'd go for the basis EULA. If I would sell them myself I would personalise
    it more.\r\nIt's a great offer to start with the LinoType EULA. With this you're
    at least 'safe'. Later on I will have a lawyer draw up my own EULA. But first
    I need to make a little bit of money with my fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks for the tips,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Also

  body: "I don't know if you would be at least \"safe\" by adopting Lino's EULA. That
    EULA would have to represent in some way, your philosophy of doing business. Only
    you can decide that.\r\n\r\nRemember that a license or contract is written for
    three entities, the foundry, the end user and the court (again thank you Frank
    Martinez). The court being the most important one. In US law, any unclear statements
    in a contract are the responsibility of the contract writer. So if your license
    fails to explain clearly what all the terms are, you, the foundry will be the
    one penalized in any legal decision.\r\n\r\nOn a separate matter, I'd like to
    see you drop the advertising signature from your posts here. But perhaps that
    is part of your business plan."
