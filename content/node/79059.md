    script, for which Linotype credits Omnibus. The sample looks a little bolder than
    the LT font, but they both connect.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"

  body: Here's more text from the page.  The "s" is a bit different and a couple of
    the other letters are less swirly, if that makes sense?  I can't figure out what
    this one is.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/font-sample-2_5064.gif]

  body: "I'm convinced this is a version of Jiffy, which was probably a film type.
    It was typical to have a range of weights, but each one may have had a different
    name. In old books I have they seems to have H, I and J initial letters (see the
    Solotype Catalog). Someone has probably done the same thing Nick did, and resurrected
    this old design, and made it connect better. The weight variations could be done
    by adding stroke thickness.\r\n\r\nHave you looks at Ale Paul's Bluemlein Scripts?
    It's possible one of those includes this, since a number of those scripts once
    appeared by other names. [I just looked at those fonts at Veer, and didn't see
    it, although <a href=\"http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Mrs-Blackfort-UMT0000113\">Mrs
    Blackfort</a> is similar.]\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The Dover book \"Brushstroke and Freestyle Alphabets\" by Dan X. Solo, printed
    in 1977 shows Jiffy and it is identical to my eyes.\r\n\r\nIf your samples are
    recent, then someone has digitized this, besides Linotype, because their version
    seems a bit different in some minor details.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: 'These samples are about 10 years old.  The weights are just strokes, no biggie.  But
    the "r" and "s" are very different shapes than Jiffy.  There are more swirlies
    (sorry I don''t know the technical term :-) ) in the Jiffy letters than this font.  Hmm.  I''ll
    keep hunting it down.  If I can''t figure it out, I''ll definitely use Jiffy in
    it''s place.  Thanks so much for your help!  '
