  National Handwriting Day in commemoration of John Hancock, the first person to sign
  the Declaration of Independence. This special day was established to promote the
  fine art of handwriting. [[www.monotypeimaging.com | Monotype Imaging]] has provided
  Typophile with examples of [[http://msg1svc.net/colov/155227/62/25130/5798/0/H/jegf.html

  of projects. The [[http://msg1svc.net/colov/155227/62/25130/5798/0/H/jegf.html |
  Handwriting Value Pack]] found on [[www.fonts.com | Fonts.com]] provides five great
  fonts that deliver the look and feel of handwriting designs. \r\n\r\nHandwriting
  has inspired some great formal script typeface designs including several[[http://msg1svc.net/colov/155227/53/25130/5807/0/H/jegf.html
  | Inaugural Invitation Fonts]]. For example, the [[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/nyregion/thecity/21prin.html
  | invitations]] to the January 20th presidential inauguration, which while hand
  engraved on copperplate, were based on modified versions of two Linotype typefaces:
  The   [[http://msg1svc.net/colov/155227/55/25130/5809/0/H/jegf.html | Shelley\u2122

  2_5434.jpg]\r\n \r\nDesigned by [[http://www.monotypeimaging.com/ProductsServices/TypeDesignerShowcase/MatthewCarter/|
  Matthew Carter]] for Linotype in 1972, the[[http://msg1svc.net/colov/155227/55/25130/5809/0/H/jegf.html
  | Shelley\u2122 Allegro]] font is a formal script design that can bring elegance
  not only to invitations, diplomas, or greeting cards, but it also works equally
  as well in display applications such as packaging or advertising. Based on the traditional
  English copperplate scripts, the[[[[http://msg1svc.net/colov/155227/51/25130/5805/0/H/jegf.html
  | Kuenstler\u2122]] font   is another formal script and features a small x-height
  and fine hairlines.\r\n"
