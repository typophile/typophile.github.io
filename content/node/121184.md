  which combine play + learn for kids.\r\nThe concept is \"building blocks\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5126.PNG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/name

  the name card is a bit too complicated but I have no idea on what to do.\r\nAnyone
  could give me any advise? I really need helps here\r\nComments and critiques are
  highly welcomed :)\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "What's the purpose of having it fold? You end up with 4 panels instead of
    2, and some of the info is hidden when the card is folded.\r\n\r\nMost business
    cards have all the vital info on one side, but yours has important info on both
    sides, which could be a problem if the card is attached to something (hung on
    a refrigerator, taped to a card in a Rolodex, etc).\r\n\r\nYou might consider
    deleting \"http://\"  in several places. Printed URLs are usually shortened these
    days (apple.com, amazon.com, etc).\r\n"

  body: Different people may have different opinions, but I don't care of the mixing
    of color squares with black-and-white squares, and some squares being flat and
    some in perspective. I would pick a style and stick with it for consistency.

    body: Talking about consistency, I don't think that the front and back of the
      name card is consistent. It's like there are too many elements or squares on
      the back of name card. Is it just me or do you feel the same? My friend suggested
      me to use circle or other shapes rather than squares, but there will be no consistency
      if I do that as the logo are built on squares.

  body: "I like the idea of the folding (and cut) card, because it plays well with
    the overall theme, but agree with James about the inconsistency of the 3D letters
    in black&white (and about removing http, etc.).\r\nIt\u2019s not clear how the
    card would look when it\u2019s folded, and I think you could play more with it,
    maybe making the inside area coloured, so that the card will look mostly white
    when folded, then a big brightly coloured square would appear when it\u2019s opened.\r\nTo
    clear things up, other than what James already suggested, I think you should get
    rid of the \u201Cbuild\u201D in 3D (the coloured squares at the bottom already
    give the same message), then place the four slogans more loosely, and without
    the grey squares (instead, you could make them play with the coloured ones).\r\nAlso,
    you don\u2019t need to repeat the logo (especially because, when small, the \u201CPlay-Skool\u201D
    become unreadable). \r\nSpeaking of the logo, I\u2019m not sure why \u201CPlay-S\u201D
    is in bold and \u201Ckool\u201D isn\u2019t, and the orange and red squares could
    be seen as flying away from the \u201CP\u201D rather than building it."

    body: "I really appreciate your comments. So I have made some adjustments on it.
      Kindly have a look at this.\r\n\r\nSo this is the front part of name card. When
      the card is being opened, you can see the whole yellow square. For the repeated
      logo on this square, I put it there because no one will know what this name
      card is about when it's being cut. So I think it's necessary. Or maybe you have
      other suggestions for this logo part?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/front_4321.PNG]\r\n\r\nThe
      back of name card. So yea, I had the 3D letters of \"build\" removed, it's not
      consistent with the theme. Also, I have change the grey squares to color squares,
      and another option, in flaticon with outlines only. But still, I think the blocks
      at the bottom is a bit too messy or it somehow didn't looks consistent from
      the front of name card. Any suggestions for the arrangement of the blocks?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/back_3532.PNG]\r\n\r\nAnd
      you mentioned how the card would look when it\u2019s folded. So this is how
      it looks. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/folded_5329.PNG]\r\n\r\nThank
      you so much for the feedback. It really helps me alot."

  body: "For the back, you could try to reference the structure of the logo: using
    the \"falling\" coloured squares as bullet points for the slogans.\r\nI didn't
    realised that the idea was to cut off the square part of the card. Anyway, one
    thing you could do in order to make the small logo more legible is to move the
    wordmark \"Play-Skool\" to the right, above \"building blocks\".\r\nI see a couple
    of problems with the folded card. The first is that there's no way it will look
    like your picture:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PS_5341.png]\r\nThe
    second one is that the contact icons' squares bear no visual relation with the
    yellow cut-out square. Again you could reprise the logo arrangment, or find some
    other alignment.\r\nLast, but not least important: on the folded card the logo
    isn't visible anywhere, while I would expect it to be the most prominent element."

    body: "Whoa, you reminded me that the logo is the the most prominent element.
      Why didn't I think of that ._.\r\nI'm thinking to fold the card to another side,
      so that the logo wouldn't be block. \r\nBasically it'll looks like this.\r\n\r\nFront
      and back (after I fold it)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/new_3803.PNG]\r\n\r\nFor
      the space there, I'll re-arrange the colored squares there. My friend suggested
      prisms but I don't think it will be consistent with other things. "
