  I made some advertisements for my school's Help Animals Club. There was obviously
  a note about meeting times at the bottom, but I've removed it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Help_Animals_Club_1_by_tlevine_3997.resized.png]\r\n\r\nThese
  ran in my school's humor newspaper (which actually isn't that funny) because it
  happens to be hated by the Help Animals Club.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Help_Animals_Club_2_by_tlevine_3812.resized.png]\r\n\r\nEveryone
  loves the idea, but I hate the typography. The dingbats don't match the main font,
  and I don't like the font that I used (Goudy Old Style). I'm planning on making
  T-shirts out of these, so I ask for advice regarding the font.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking
  it should be something like a pink shirt with white text in a <b>girly handwriting
  font</b> whose lowercase \"i\" is dotted with a \u2661. It would also need <b>matching
  \u2664\u2661\u2667\u2662</b>. (And they should be open like that.) Can someone recommend
  such a font? It's fine if the i isn't dotted with a \u2661 as that should be easy
  to make if the font has a separate \u2661.\r\n\r\nIf I can't find that font, I'm
  thinking some other friendly font with matching \u2664\u2661\u2667\u2662 so I don't
  have to adjust free ones to match the font. You're welcome to recommend other fonts
  if you don't have any ideas for the girly handwriting font.\r\n\r\nI plan on removing
  the \u2665\u2665 from the first one because the font will have hearts on the \"i\"s.
  Also, I plan on replacing \"animals\" with animals of the purchaser's choice."

  body: I hadn't realized that other people had already done this, although it isn't
    surprising. Still, even my original version was better than those things from
    Kingdom of Loathing.

  body: "It turns out that one of my friends also likes type, particularly handwriting,
    and recommended [[http://www.1001freefonts.com/catholicschoolgirls.htm|Catholic
    School Girls]]. It's close to what I want, but doesn't feel quite right to me;
    I think I want something that looks neater. I tried it anyway. (I know the spacing's
    all wrong.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20080413_6585.png]\r\nI think
    I want script that isn't slanted (last row of the image). Can someone recommend
    a font like this?\r\n\r\nIt comes out pretty nicely when I do this with a pen,
    but it's hard for me to do it so nicely with a graphics tablet, and I'd like to
    see what fonts like this are available. If I can't find an existing font I like,
    I'll do it by hand and scan it."
