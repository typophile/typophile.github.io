  like it) for a charity fundraising event for our local homeless shelter and I'd
  like to stick with the same font for some additional text on the invitations, flyers,
  etc.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/choctealogo_sm_4328.jpg]"

  body: Looks like the work of Jill Bell (see <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/swank/">Swank</a>)
    but I haven't seen this one.

  body: "My first imulse was to say 'hand-drawn', but on closer inspection it could
    certainly be an OpenType font with alternate endings. I agree this style is like
    Jill Bell's work, but Ronna Penner (Typadelic) also has this feel at times in
    her fonts. In fact, it somewhat resembles her <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typadelic/black-jack/\">Black
    Jack</a>, which is a free font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thank you so much. I agree it looks a lot like Black Jack. I also found a
    font with similar characteristics called Liorah http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/liorah/
    that looks like it might work if I squish it a bit. Thanks to all!
