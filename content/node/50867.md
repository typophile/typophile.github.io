  done, but I need some help with the non-English glyphs:\r\n\r\n1. I have gone through
  the websites of Gunnlaugur SE Briem, Adam Twardoch, Diacritics Project, and many
  pages on Typophile, and they all were extremely helpful. I don't know if I interpreted
  all the information correctly and would like people to comment on the accuracy their
  native language glyphs.\r\n\r\n2. The PDF shows the character set I have settled
  on, but I would like to know if I missed anything.\r\n\r\n3. What are the common
  ligatures of non-English languages.\r\n\r\nhttp://typefetish.com/works/rm_it_cs.pdf\r\n\r\nmuch
  thanks\r\nMichael\r\n"

    italic Q :)"

  body: "Regarding Polish diacritics all but \u0141 and \u0142 (uc and lc slashed
    L) are really well drawn, which is not common. Without \u0141 and \u0142 (uc and
    lc slashed L) you cannot typeset texts in Polish language. There's also historical
    and rare ligature combining to lc \"\u0142s\" [[http://typografia.ogme.pl/images/stories/podstawy/rys_roz_2/Ligatury_stadardowe3.gif|link
    to example of ligature \u0142\u0142]]. BTW very interesting typeface.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAntoni"

  body: You might find Thomas Phinney's blog page about [[http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html#more|Extended
    Latin character sets]] useful too. It is mostly about varying levels of language
    support, which isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it might keep you from
    working harder than you have to. You have probably already seen it referenced
    in another Typophile thread though.

  body: "Thanks for all the comments everyone. \r\n\r\nBen, I am still doing some
    fine tuning of the curves and I haven't decomposed all the characters yet so a
    few of them do get knocked out when they overlap. \r\n\r\nAntoni, I do have a
    \u0141 and \u0142. I don't know if you saw them or not. They are up near the top
    of the file in a section called \"derivatives\". From what I read I didn't think
    they were diacritics and I didn't know exactly how to define them, so they got
    group with other slash or bar characters. If you did see them but thought they
    were designed incorrectly, I would appreciate some specifics.\r\n\r\nJason, it
    has been awhile since I have seen that page. I kind of forgot about it. Thanks."

  body: "The typeface looks quite interesting. The important omitted glyphs are as
    follows:\r\nIdotaccent (uni0130) and dotlessi (uni0131) (Turkish, discussed [[http://typophile.com/node/13570|here]])\r\nTcommaaccent
    and tcommaaccent (without Unicode reference, needed for Romanian)\r\nEng (uni014A)
    and eng (uni014B) (needed for rare languages like Sami and some African languages)\r\n\r\nIf
    becoming punctual, there are also 4 optional glyphs you should add, although in
    many typefaces they are not present - <strong>[[http://typophile.com/node/35221|Aringacute/aringacute]]</strong>
    and <strong>Oslashacute/oslashacute</strong> (although I'm too lazy to check the
    Unicode points for them). \r\n\r\nAlso from WGL4 maybe you should add kgreenlandic
    (uni0131) and napostrophe (uni0149), although I haven't seen them in real use.\r\n\r\nThe
    matter of adding CE charset is discussed in more detail [[http://www.typophile.com/node/2764|here]].\r\n\r\nNow
    about the quirks: I have some doubts regarding the ogonek placement in iogonek
    (Roman). Otherwise the diacritics placement looks ok to me."

    by \"without Unicode reference\".\r\n\r\nI am now working on an Eng.\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone know what languages the Aringacute, Oslashacute, kgreenlandic and napostrophe
    would be use in? I can't find any information that make me believe they are needed
    any longer."

  body: "Aringacute and Oslashacute are almost obsolete, although still are used in
    some Danish grammars, dictionaries and other linguistic texts, perhaps also in
    some poetry (quoting John Hudson from <strong>[[http://typophile.com/node/35221|here]]</strong>).
    kgreenlandic (aka <strong>kra</strong>)and napostrophe is almost extinct, but
    I still see them often implemented in many typefaces. They are described in this
    <strong>[[http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/greenlandic.pdf|PDF]]</strong> by
    Michael Everson. Implementing it possibly would require to add also a specific
    Greenlandic uppercase K, as described <strong>[[http://typophile.com/node/35971|here]]</strong>.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the lack of Unicode reference of Tcommaaccent the mistake is mine (in my old FontLab
    codepages I found only the glyph name, not Unicode values). Should have checked
    more thoroughly.\r\n\r\nNone of these glyphs are in heavy use; I mention them
    only because they still exist in [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/WGL4.htm|WGL4
    specifications]] (i.e. Microsoft cosider them still not totally extinct)."
