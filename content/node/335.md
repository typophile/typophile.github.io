body: The city where I live &#40;Coimbra, Portugal&#41;presented us the new identity
  and logo last week on a big party with a Michael Nyman show and everything... I
  intended to present the logo in these phoruns to ask for a typographic expert oppinion
  &#40;Something on the type is just wrong to me&#41; but now the thing got even more
  interesting! Someone found a simmilar logo of a company called Quintiles Transnational..
  <BR> <BR>The designer of coimbra&#39;s logo says the logo represents a serpent &#40;found
  on the old coimbra&#39;s Blazon&#41;. I still don&#39;t know why he splitted the
  Word in to COIM &#43; BRA. <BR> <BR>The quintiles logo represents a Q, I guess.

  <BR> <BR>1. I still can&#39;t decide if this is plain Coincidence or a bloody ripp-off.
  What do you typophiles think? <BR> <BR>2. Can you express the feedback on coimbra&#39;s
  logos? Is it balanced? Is the O logo on the COIMBRA word just placed without any
  care? And what abou the C

  body: That cut circle is such a simple construct, it&#39;s probably not ripped off.
    <BR> <BR>As for the type, to me Trajan itself is a bad choice, and when you throw
    in funny distortions and gratuitous letterform carnage, well...  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I am not an expert...though i can say  <BR>that the composition of the elements
    <BR>seems disturbing to me.  <BR>Esspecially that river the &#34;De&#34; leaves  <BR>in
    the &#34;camara municipal de Coimbra&#34;.  <BR> <BR>The &#34;de&#34; ligature
    is illegible and would  <BR>make more sence as a ligature of &#34;ed&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>The &#34;M&#34; in &#34;Coimbra&#34; is from a different  <BR>font..?&#40;why?&#41;
    and the &#34;O&#34;-logotype in  <BR>the word &#34;Coimbra&#34; just doesn&#39;t
    fit,  <BR>esspecially when compined with this  <BR>long-tailed &#34;R&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>In conclusion from the few things I know  <BR>for Coimbra &#40;the historical
    university and the  <BR>great tradition of Fado&#41; I think it deserves  <BR>an
    id which carries historical values and this  <BR>cannot be achieved with that
    simple &#34;O&#34; form. <BR> <BR>ah...and when the &#34;Coimbra&#34; is splited
    to  <BR>COIM....BRA! you cannot avoid thinking about  <BR>Eva Herzingova... <BR>
    <BR>OK! i think i&#39;ve been a bad boy today.  <BR>there was no purpose to insult
    anyone,  <BR>i just tried to express what i really felt  <BR>about the design...which
    is great comparing  <BR>to our sign of Thessaloniki. By the way six  <BR>months
    ago i designed logos for the municipality  <BR>and trust me...you don&#39;t want
    to get involved  <BR>with those people who take decisions.  <BR>They have a charisma
    to manipulate everything  <BR>in order to end up terrible. <BR> <BR>Good day to
    everybody!

  body: Hello Adriano, I saw recently this logo &#40;Coimbra&#41; I had a strange
    felling about the  combination betten the symbol &#40;very grotesque&#41; and
    the lettering <BR>&#40;Roman&#41;.  Anyway its strange the coencidence betten
    the two samples that you show &#40;very coencidence&#41; . As Christos said the
    ligature D is lost in that line &#40;ilegible&#41;.  The tail of the capital &#40;R&#41;
    is two must decorative if we compare all the logo. Thank&#39;s for this samples
    and observations. <BR> <BR>Cumprimentos

    can&#39;t be too literal. The way this stuff works &#40;one hopes&#41; is that
    people who already have an association of Coimbra/serpent will quickly notice
    and appreciate the subtle reference. <BR> <BR>And the thing does have a head!

    can&#39;t be too generic either. I would contend that there isn&#39;t a &#34;subtle&#34;
    reference here but a pretentious/poorly-crafted/imperceptive/obtuse one. <BR>
    <BR>I haven&#39;t got an axe to grind here but lazy logos posturing under a tortured
    rationale really annoy me. <BR> <BR>&#40;I hope I&#39;m not pissing anyone off...&#41;'

  body: 'Besides, it may have a head but, as Adriano&#39;s amendment demonstrates,
    it doesn&#39;t have a tail. Adriano&#39;s gif looks more like an eel. Or is it
    supposed to be eating its tail? In this case it doesn&#39;t, in fact, have the
    head that is claimed for it. <BR> <BR>I really don&#39;t think many people would
    see this logo as a stylized snake '

  body: I just got a copy of the identity book that was made for the Coimbra identity
    and he presentes this old illustration as the origin of the logo <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11689.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>At
    the end, and besides the simmilarity &amp; the confusing typography what puzzles
    me more is that it doesn&#39;t represent the city as a whole... Coimbra is not
    know for snakes, or serpents and it&#39;s simbolism as an &#34;insuflator of life&#34;
    and plenty other analogies &#40;it&#39;s a big booklet&#41; doesn&#39;t convice
    me in 100%. I only question now how will the foreign people will think looking
    at this logo..

    simplified Ouroboros and the typography seems so apart, to make it worse the thick
    horizontal line serves as a &#34;border&#34; separating even more the two elements
    &#40;our beloved snake ;&#41; and the Coimbra typography&#41;
