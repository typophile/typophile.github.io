body: I have Adobe programs on my PC, running Win98 but the fonts don&#39;t show up
  outside of the program.  I haven&#39;t installed an ATM because I understand ATM
  and XP don&#39;t get along.  How do I install Post Script fonts on XP without an
  ATM &#40;or can I&#41; ? Where are the fonts located, what extention are they? <BR>Thanks.&#60;/font&#62;

  body: I never heard about ATM and Win XP not getting along... <BR>That said, you
    install PostScript fonts on Windows 2000 and XP the same way you install TT or
    OT fonts - go to &#34;Fonts&#34; in the Control Panel, or to the Windows\Fonts
    folder with Explorer, then go to File &#62; Install New Font. <BR> <BR>Windows
    XP and 2000 natively support PostScript fonts.

  body: The location of the fonts will depend on the programs you have installed and
    their respective versions. Just do a search for .pfm or .pfb files within your
    \program files\adobe folder and they should come up.

  body: ATM will let you install and uninstall fonts without going through the control
    panel, but that&#39;s about it. <BR> <BR>I stopped using it after the transition
    to XP because I couldn&#39;t stand the way it interacted with the system.  And
    no matter what I did, I couldn&#39;t get the windows font viewer to reassociate
    with postscript fonts, even after uninstalling ATM.

  body: It lets me group fonts by sets and activate/ deactivate them as groups.  <BR>Maybe
    you can do that in control panel too, I don&#39;t know. I also use it as  <BR>a
    font viewer &#40;just double click&#41;. It works for me, but I wouldn&#39;t say
    I&#39;m  <BR>passionate about it.

    I installed directly to XP without an ATM.  Figured I might as well be safe than
    sorry.  I&#39;ve had enough trouble setting this latest and greatest machine up.  Still
    having XP growing pains.  Still looking for BroadwayBT-Regular and Engravers Gothic
