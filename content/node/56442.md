    problematic characters)?\r\nAlso check out: <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/18067\">How

  body: If you're on a Mac, make sure the extension appears as part of the filename.
    For example, if you do a screen grab and "Picture 1" appears on your desktop,
    change the filename and add the extension ".png" (unless you have your grab setting
    for another format).

  body: Unique file names matter. Changing "Picture 1" to "picture_1.png" may not
    work if someone else has put an image in the system with the same name. Just change
    the file name to "picture_1_whatever.png".
