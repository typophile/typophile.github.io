body: I love this font. It's very utilitarian -- type at it most basic, yet with a
  bit of personality. Reminds me of <a href=http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=unibody&id2=overview>Unibody
  by Underware</a> but that's not what it is. Little help? Anyone?

  body: "Thank you all. Thanks especially for introducing me to these font sources.
    I'm so enamored with the Miniml Fonts (a little twitchy-eyed, but enamored nonetheless)
    that I think I'll buy the whole package.  You guys are the best.\r\n\r\nDGM\r\n"
