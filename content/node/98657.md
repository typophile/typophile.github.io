  it. I've tried to put the following layout together but it just looks very ordinary
  to me, the typography particularly, no life to it - any tips or advice would be
  much appreciated. Thank you.\r\n\r\nFonts in order are; House Slant, Gill Sans,
  and Cubano. (I don't know what the logo fonts are - just traced them)"

  body: "The first thing I see is the skeleton. Skeletons imply death.  And this one
    doesn't look happy or strong at all - he looks like he's smirking or just drank
    something very bitter. The glass looks ghostly and unreal.\r\n\r\nIt's not until
    I've read all of the text that I see the 'strong bones'. But in real life I wouldn't
    have gotten that far.  It's a good thing that the product name is small, so I
    might not have noticed it all; otherwise my impression would be negative.\r\n\r\nNote
    that this has nothing at all to do with the typography. The skeleton is such an
    overwhelming presence that I didn't really think about the type. But looking at
    it separately,  I see 6 different typefaces in eight sizes. \"Good Strong Bones\"
    looks crowded, and needs  commas after Good and Strong to bring them together.
    \ The size difference makes BONES more important (i.e., louder) than Strong, which
    in turn is louder than Good. \r\n\r\n - Herb"

    this particular idea and start working on something else.
