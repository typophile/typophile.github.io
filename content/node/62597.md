  Would people here recommend dropping these abbreviations down to the x-height? I
  don't think either are ideal.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nS"

    to x-height \u2013 that would look awkward. Half a point smaller would do."

    Sans is a remake of News Gothic, Franklin Gothic and Trade Gothic. (They were
    originally designed to work together.)

  body: Robert Bringhurst says FBI and NATO should really be small caps. The idea
    is that they are part of a sentence and should blend in gracefully (like oldstyle
    numbers). But just like with numbers it might be "pretentious" as they put it
    on the H&FJ website. In one of their typefaces they offer a three-quarter set
    of figures as a solution to that.

  body: "> Who cares what Bringhurst says. Develop your own typographic sensibilities.\r\n\r\nWell,
    a lot of designers do. Because most of what he says makes sense. \r\n\r\nIf we
    all \"develop our own typographic sensibilities\" we will wind up with a world
    where Comic Sans is appropriate for tombstones and funeral invitations.\r\n\r\nFirst
    you learn the rules. They you learn how to break the rules. (It doesn't work the
    other way round.)"

    feels it conveys what they want. Good for them. Better that than feeling the need
    to consulting an arbiter of taste before making a move."

  body: "If you have to use a face that has no small caps, I would recommend:\r\n\r\n1.
    Drop the cap height down to just taller than x-height\r\n2. Track it out a bit\r\n3.
    Beef up the weight with the Stroke feature in your layout application--you can
    add reaaaaly small amounts.\r\n4. Optional, increase horizontal scaling, say to
    103 or 104%.\r\n\r\nThis is my practice, but as James says, develop your own sensibility
    as to which of these techniques you employ, and exactly what values you assign
    to the variables."
