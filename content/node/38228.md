  illustrator in the past month, and want to track down samples of his work again.\r\nThe
  trouble is, I cant remember his name; he produced exquisite work, hand rendering
  sans serif style fonts and applying his own style of flourishes/sweeps.  Very geometric
  and precise, resulting in a spectacular explosion of type and illustration.\r\nWondering
  if anyone can point me in the right direction"
