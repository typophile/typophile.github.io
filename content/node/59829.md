  body: "Football clubs (and national teams too) are now getting into the habit of
    having their own bespoke numbers drawn. \r\n\r\nSome like the English Barclays
    Premier League and Coca-Cola Championship and Leagues 1 and 2 have to wear the
    league's own prescribed numbers (which are bespoke).\r\n\r\nEngland have recently
    moved away from numbers drawn by Jeremy Tankard towards something a little more
    traditional in the same vein as Gill Sans in keeping with their new kits which
    have a very classical feel (literally feels like cotton as opposed to polyester,
    but is in fact a blend of the two).\r\n\r\nLooking at the photo of Ronnie from
    the back, I'd say that the club's crest on the number is indicative of a bespoke
    design. That is not to say a club won't use an off-the-shelf typeface but my money's
    on bespoke, maybe designed in-house or by the Adidas replicas guys.\r\n\r\nI couldn't
    tell you if the clubs from La Liga are legally bound to use La Liga style numbers
    or not but, if so, these are not them (Real Madrid's crest makes them Real Madrid
    numbers)."

  body: "I have noticed too that clubs playing in European competitions will sometimes
    wear numbers that are different form the domestic shirt numbers (albeit on exactly
    the same kit apart from the numbers), since the domestic league's numbers have
    a domestic league branding on them in a similar size and position to the Real
    Madrid crest on the number 9 as worn by Cristiano Ronaldo.\r\n\r\nYou can probably
    guess that I find the football numbers thing fascinating. Sorry if I've bored
    you!"
