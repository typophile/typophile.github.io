  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">All,

Just wondering how some of you would handle this. Yesterday I was putting together an ad that included a three-sentence extract from a review. Only the final sentence needed to be in boldface. I made the decision to keep the close quote in bold, even though I had started the little paragraph with a normal-weight open quote.

As I assessed the appearance of the 'graph, it seemed less distracting to keep the open quote the same color as the top two lines (rom) and to make the close quote the same color as the last line (bf), even if it made the <em>pair</em> of quotes asymmetrical. Does this seem logical to you? (Quotes were same size as text.)

I generally keep the close quote, or paren, or whatever, in the same style as the text just before it. But I bet Chicago would clarify this. I'll also query an editor I know.</div>

This is what I dislike about em dashes set closed up: the very thing that is supposed to connote a pause, ends up super-gluing the two neighboring words to each other instead of separating them. Or perhaps a better description is that the two words appear stabbed onto the ends of a skishkebob skewer. I like the gentler approach of having some space between the dash and what it is separating, and often use an en-dash depending on what type face I'm using. (First learned this from Williamson's <em> Methods of Book Design </em> so I suppose it's more of an English tradition than Amurrican.)</div>

Yes, I that’s what we do in Europe, I think. (I just had to have upright parentheses, goodbye, semantics.)

<cite>Even for sans serif?</cite>

Yes, for default at least. I’ve been thinking whether to include slanted parentheses in my fonts or not. I guess I should.

Parentheses are kind of neutral glyphs. They’re not letters, at least. Oblique ones look like crap to me.

I think there was a thread about slanting plus sign and other special characters. Were parentheses there, too?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah - I'm an old typesetter - and I love putting in my 2 cents when it comes to true typesetting questions.

As a person who did advertising typography—I'm with you guys…
The punctuation always looked best in the typeface that was set for that line…

However, Chicago Manual of Style and every editor I ever knew in New York will let you know for book interiors—ah, not so. When you have a paragraph that is set in roman, but has a list in italics - the comma that separates each item in the list is to be roman. If you have a sentence that starts our in regular weight, and ends in a bold weight, the punction—be it a period, exclamation mark (ah, with a bang) and say, quote marks are all to be in the regular weight.

I hope this clears things up just a little…

And they say you guys didn't need professionals anymore…

P.S. You mean <em>like this</em>?
But be prepared to add LS (letterspace)

I agree. I think the color of a book page is better maintained by not bolding the punctuation. Perhaps that is why the rule has been not bold them. </div>
