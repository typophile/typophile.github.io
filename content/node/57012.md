  be considered as taking a digital photo. Technically it's pretty much the same as
  a digital photo!?\r\n\r\nJust curious :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\nMax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "No, as far as I know making screenshots (if there is a window of an application
    in it for example) doesn't make you the copyright holder. I know this because
    you aren't allowed to use them on Wikipedia (I write articles sometimes) without
    proper permission (as you probably know Wikipedia does not allow copyrighted images
    on it without proper permission).\r\n\r\nYou would only have copyright if it is
    an original creative effort. For example, taking a photograph of a painting doesn't
    usually make you the copyrightholder either."
