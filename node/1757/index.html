  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here is an illustration from Letterletter by Gerrit Noordzij. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/19023.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>I may not have the proportions of the white squares to the black exact.  <BR> <BR>The idea is that when you look at this your brain does a &#39;gestalt switch&#39; between seeing white squares against black one moment, and a framed cross the next. <BR> <BR>Noordzij says &#34;Real characters have built-in stabilizers that keep black shapes in the forground&#34;. In other words, they avoid the dazzle in this illustration.  <BR> <BR>I am interested in what you experienced type designers think of the problem of avoiding dazzle, particularly in text faces.  <BR> <BR>First of all, do you think Noordzij has it right? Is getting type to rest on the page a matter of balancing white and black? And what are your thoughts on doing it? <BR> <BR>What would make me question whether the black/white balance is all of the story is the to me undesirable dazzle in many of the &#39;didone&#39; class of type in small sizes. It seems like part of the story is just the thinness of the lines.  <BR> <BR>I was recently struck by how well Kent Lew&#39;s new face, Whitman, &#39;rests&#39; on the page, at least judged by the samples on the internet. I am interested in how he and others have approached this problem. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think GN is totally right about the centrality of balancing the Black and White. I call it notan &#40;a Japanese term&#41;. Ironically, notan is the reason his theories of type design don&#39;t make sense! <BR> <BR>&#62; &#34;Real characters have built-in stabilizers that keep black shapes in the forground&#34; <BR> <BR>There is no foreground &#40;at least not during immersive reading&#41;. We read notan, the balance, not the Black and White separately. <BR> <BR>The relevance of notan to type design is complex, because we have to design &#34;firm&#34; atomic blacks, but half the whites &#40;the sidebearings&#41; exist on a more abstract level &#40;since they only work in pairs&#41;. OpenType actually allows us to equalize the treatment of Black and White &#40;by designing entire words which would get swapped in contextually&#41;, but I don&#39;t see many people doing that... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Hrant. Very interesting. I hadn&#39;t thought of symmetry as a factor. <BR> <BR>I am hoping that this will lure some others as well into spilling secrets of &#39;notan&#39;. As well as Kent Lew&#39;s accomplishment, mentioned above, James Montalbano&#39;s Clearview seems to be an example where this was thought out carefully.  <BR> <BR>He notes on his website that the typeface is designed to reduce &#39;halation&#39; experienced by older drivers looking at lighted signs at night. <BR> <BR>What is this about? <BR> <BR>For myself, I think that fineness of lines and points can create dazzle, as well as evenly spaced parallel lines. I think there are psycho-optical effects going on that affect comfort in reading, but they do seem to be complex.  <BR> <BR>  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks so much, James; that is really interesting.  <BR> <BR>Hrant, your hypothesis on why the same considerations apply to text sizes seems plausible to me.  <BR> <BR>When you look at a page of small text in Helvetica or Bodoni, the problem is not that you can&#39;t read it. It is that it is noticeably more effort to do it, and it probably slows you down also. If we do, as you &#40;and others?&#41; hypothesize gather significant information outside our center of focus, then that would explain it. <BR> <BR>The sharp points and hairlines - and more closed counters etc - would fuzz out before more beefy points and lines, and open counters, so you would lose that information.  <BR> <BR>It may even be that this is the cause of the &#39;dazzle&#39; experience. When you look away slightly from part of the text with sharp or thin lines, they fuzz into vanshing, and move your eyes they &#39;pop&#39; back into appearance. This would explain the &#39;twinkling&#39; experience.  <BR> <BR>I do have the feeling that there are also some &#39;optical illusion&#39; effects as Noordzij hypothesizes. -and the two types may interact.  <BR> <BR>With Whitman, the &#39;resting&#39; effect is noticable to me at least, but it is a very different face from Clearview - and less beefy than James Montalbano&#39;s Rawlings.  <BR> <BR>I hope we can rope Kent Lew into commenting on this also. <BR> <BR>Very informative!   </div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;test the design ...in the actual environment. <BR> <BR>This is very important for newspaper fonts. One&#39;s typefaces &#40;both headline and text&#41; may look perfect on a laser proof on white paper, but they will be dull printed with dark grey ink &#40;aka black, but nowhere near the density of toner&#41; on light grey newsprint paper. So a little pre-emptive dazzle is required.  <BR> <BR>So to answer the original post, if I&#39;m designing a typeface for a specific use, I try and get what I consider to be just enough sparkle, but not too much dazzle, for that context, and, as James says, do in situ tests. <BR> <BR>However, with more &#34;experimental&#34; typefaces &#40;and perhaps Vendome may be so described&#41;, I may decide to crank up the dazzle to 11 just for the hell of it, and let typographers figure out what to do with the font. Hence Eunoia. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/19121.jpg" alt="TurnUpTheDaz"> <BR> <BR>With a dazzling font, the typographer has the option of playing off the dazzle by printing it in subtle colors, or on rough stock, or very small, or filtered, or moving fast, or low res, in which circumstances the dazzle can be considered a pre-emptive sharpening. Or the typographer may use the font precisely for its eye-popping effect.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;Here too, you&#39;re talking about display, not text. <BR> <BR>No, both. <BR> <BR>&#62;a box of tricks to turn up or down the dazzle <BR> <BR>Generally, I don&#39;t think about it too much. There are so many design axes &#40;or elements in the graphic language of a typeface&#41;, and once you get the knack of type design, they all get mashed together, into a global skill. <BR> <BR>I would say that dazzle is a question of contrast and precision, so it can manifest in any parameter -- which is why Bodoni is so dazzling across the board, as it has strong thick/thin stem-width contrast, and also sharp serifs -- sharpness being a strong figure/ground contrast at the level of detail. Bodoni also has a strong contrast between straight and round forms. <BR> <BR>The dazzle that is caused by an equivalence of positive/negative forms, where there&#39;s ambivalence about which is figure and which ground, is apparent in Vendome, where the sharpness of the serif shape is &#34;mirrored&#34; in the sharpness of the acute joints. <BR> <BR>Another kind of dazzle caused by equivalence and precision is the &#34;picket fence&#34; effect of evenly spaced vertical stems. <BR> <BR>Again, on the subject of equivalence, when a typeface has a very precise evenness of spacing between characters -- I mean the almost imperceptible negative &#34;hairline&#34; space between adjacent serifs -- this creates sparkle, if not dazzle. You can also see that in Extra Bold House Gothic. <BR> <BR></div>
