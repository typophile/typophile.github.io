  the S and Y are different.\r\n\r\nAny help greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nDave\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CMD_5917.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SMD_6588.gif]"

  body: "The other one is Rotis Semi Serif Black Schoolbook with the alternate Venetian
    \u2018e\u2019.\r\n\r\nNo, seriously: this looks rather like an unbalanced homebrew
    mix of a number of different typefaces. Some characters/terminals suggest it might
    have started out with Rotis in mind once, cf. its <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/rotis_semi_serif_by_adobe_std_65_bold/&sample_text=Consolidatemydebt.co.uk\">Semi
    Serif Bold</a> (there is no Rotis Black, and of course no \u2018Schoolbook\u2019
    style with single-storey \u2018a\u2019 either).\r\n\r\nFor a lusty semi-serif,
    have a look at <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/typefaces-45-areplos-text-pro-bold\">Areplos</a>
    by [[Jan Solpera]].\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Wow, thankyou so much!\r\n\r\nThe help on the Consolidate font was particularly
    fantastic! I knew it must have started with a fairly commn font and of course
    Rotis fits the bill perfectly.\r\n\r\nthanks again for the speedy response.\r\n\r\nDave"

    fonts at dafont which have \xBBborrowed\xAB some details from Rotis. Serif was
    one of the few. "
