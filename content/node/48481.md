body: "I'm an intern for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiLDCOAST|WilDCOAST]] and
  one of our areas of focus is promoting ecotourism in Latin America.  As you would
  expect many of these companies don't have the money or knowhow to create a snazzy
  logo (or website) so we're designing it for them.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm working on
  [[http://bajabykayak.com/|Baja by Kayak]]\r\n \r\n \r\nTheir current \"logo\":\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gen_643_6540.1.gif]\r\n
  \r\n \r\nMy new design (in progress):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kayak_6592.gif]\r\n
  \r\n \r\nThere's no special reason for the \"A\" to stand out, and I'm not especially
  attached to the colors. Also I haven't yet figured out how the \"Baja by\" text
  will be incorporated so feel free to offer an ideas. :)"

  body: As an exercise in combining letters it's interesting, but as Jupiterboy said
    you really need to work with all of the elements to create a successful design.
    It's easy to fall into the trap of designing one element and then having to force
    the rest of the design to work with it. Play with the full name, inspiration will
    come.

    the company's business originates. If people are coming from afar <em>explicitly</em>
    for this service, then Baja's more important. However, if their customers are
    mostly people <em>already</em> traveling through the area then Kayak's more important.\r\n\r\nIf
    you really felt the need to emphasize one word over the other, you could perhaps
    create two versions: a Kayak one for all signage and local advertising, and a
    Baja one for the company website and ads targeting international travelers."

    into a dark brown rigid square I'd make straight vertical sides more convex. So
