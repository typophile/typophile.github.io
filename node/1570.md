  history &#40;though, it&#39;s in Russian only&#41;. <BR>I know nothing in the typography
  and composition, but I just made new image for the title page of my site, and need
  some advices. <BR>This image is here: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/18235.png"
  alt="Title Image"> <BR> <BR>&#40;Old variants are <a href="http://norse.net.ru/img/title.png"
  target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://norse.net.ru/img/title2.png" target="_blank">here</a>&#41;
  <BR>The title page of my site is <a href="http://norse.net.ru" target="_blank">here</a>
  <BR> <BR>Is my new image OK? <BR>I try to make rune-styled inscription. However,
  as you know, runes don&#39;t use horizontal lines, but I can&#39;t avoid them. <BR>
  <BR>Norroen dyrd means Norse Glory &#40;in Old Norse&#41;. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions
  are welcome! <BR>Thanks. <BR>Tim <BR> <BR>P.S. I am from Ukraine.'
