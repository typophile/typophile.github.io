    the time when attempting to post.

  body: FYI, the preview function takes apprximately 3 seconds to process, while the
    post function can take upwards of 40 seconds.

  body: I get the same problem with the delay, even though I have a  <BR>fast connection.
    I get the 500 error once in a while. The  <BR>script that runs Typophile seems
    to have trouble sending  <BR>back the updated page with your post appended, but
    not  <BR>storing the post. If you get the error, go back to the page  <BR>you
    posted to and see if it&#39;s there. Most likely it will be. If  <BR>you are worried
    that you might lose your post, copy it to  <BR>the clipboard before hitting the
    &#34;post this message&#34; button.

  body: Yeah, my post always goes up, but I always get the 500 error.  Is there a
    sys admin that is aware of this? <BR> <BR>Not a big deal, just a minor nuisance.
