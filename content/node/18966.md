  time to time I like to open up exisiting fonts \r\nin Type Tool to see how they
  work. I recentley opened up\r\nHelvetica Regular and noticed that on the C they
  have\r\nthese guidelines, in Tpye Tool it is located on the Vector\r\ncontrol layer,
  that follow the curve. When I erase the\r\nguidlines it then erases the  section
  of the font.\r\nWhat are these lines for and how do you use them?\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nj
