body: I am planning a trip to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in June and will have a few
  days each in [[London]], Bath and Dublin. Other than the "must visits" such as the
  British Museum. British Library, V&A and Trinity College--can anyone suggest a point
  of typographic interest that I should seek out?

    Bath.

  body: Bath is beautiful and the neo-classical street names carved directly into
    the buildings are worth the trip alone for a lettering enthusiast. There are also
    some interesting inscriptions in the Abbey (which also has one of the finest fan
    vaulted ceiling anywhere). Unfortunately, most of the secondhand bookshops have
    closed in the past few years, so I don't find Bath as much fun as I used to.

    you are around in Dublin on the 28th June, there is a showing of Helvetica the
    movie at the Sugar Club. There is also an exhibition of the Leonardo Codex Leicester
    at the Chester Beatty library from the 13th June onwards, you have to in advance
    for this I think. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.cbl.ie/exhibitions/Temporary.aspx?L1Link=36&L2Link=242&Sb=Temporary%20Exhibitions\r\n\r\nand
    of course you have it on your list already but dont miss the Book of Kells :-)\r\n\r\nenjoy\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I did have the good fortune to see the Book of Kells years ago, when it visited
    San Francisco (shortly after the restoration directed by Peter Waters, I think)
    as part of a large Irish cultural exhibition. I was astonished to see the pages
    stuck full of punctures from use of the compass. What amazing artists they must
    have been to create the joyful \"dancing X\" with drawing instruments. It will
    be intresting to see it again with eyes several decades older.\r\n\r\nWe will
    visit the Long House. My mate loves a good beer, and I intend to give up my customary
    glass of wine in favor of local beer while in the UK. "
