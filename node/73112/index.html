I feel like the best of fonts are less tools and more works of art (and thus, I feel like those who work on them should absolutely be compensated).

My purpose in posting is to ask if there is any good site for free and open-source fonts (and possibly WebFont supported). I've done quite a bit of web design, and having access to good WebFonts would be wonderful. Plus, there are several Open-source typefaces that I prefer over their proprietary counterparts (i.e. Deja Vu Serif and Liberation Serif are infinitely better than Times New Roman).

Again, I'm not asking for any Commercial typefaces, I'm asking for a good place to find fonts that were designed with the intent of being free to use for everyone and anyone that wants.

Any help and all suggestions are greatly appreciated!

I'd say you have it all backwards. Works of art are not ment to be used. I suppose you could cover a hole in the wall with a picture, but if that is your purpose, you don't need a high-dollar painting.

Any use of type tends to make it look worse than a carefully crafted specimen sheet. After you set that specimen, it's all downhill.

There is a notion that artists do their thing for the joy of it, not for the money. Usually not true of craftsmen.</div>

Not always...

The Eames Lounge Chair was certainly a work of art, and it was meant to be sat upon.

A Stradivarius is a work of art, and it was meant to be played.

Falling Water (the house by Frank Lloyd Wright) is a work of art, and it was meant to be lived in.

Same discussion, again? What gives?

I love doing open source work. The thankful emails I get every day are more than enough to keep me going. But I would starve if I didn't get paid for it.

Full-time type designers, be honest. Money isn't just some symbolic hat taken off to your artistic skills*; it's your breakfast. No breakfast, no more fonts. Unless you've already made your million, which would legitimize this controversy.

* or craftsmanship, whatever.</div>

Really? So if it looked good but sounded bad, it would still be a good violin?

But if it looked "bad" and sounded like a Strad, it'd be good. Ask Yo-Yo Ma about the electronic Cello.</div>

Well folks can certainly agree or disagree with specific items I mentioned, but my point was just that  "works of art" covers a broad range of items, some of which are actually used in everyday life.

The Museum of Modern Art in New York, for example, has displayed items as diverse as furniture, computers, jewelry, even kitchen utensils.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Florian, I didn't mean to say that craftsmen shouldn't be compensated. I just meant to say that typefaces are one of the few digital creations that I feel can legitimately be proprietary (though I am one of those idealists who wishes for all digital work to one day be open-source).

As for the "works of art" argument. One of the most fascinating types of art I've ever come across is that of functional art. A true work of art still mean to be used. This is how I see typefaces.

Thanks for all the discussion and all the suggestions, this has all been very helpful!
