  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>We have interesting project at the moment. Working on a title sequence for a western film that is set in an arabic country. I&rsquo;m thinking of going down two paths of either choosing a sans serif face that has a real international feel to it, perhaps something condensed and then using arabic characters as textural elements throughout the sequence or trying to source a latin face that is arabic influenced. This could either be achieved my manually adding details to an existing face but I think the sheer volume of type rules this one out which leaves me to find that elusive face.</p>
<p>The only thing I have come across that is even remotely close is T26 regallo 
<a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/fontsearch.php?q=regallo&amp;ss=2">http://www.t26.com/fonts/fontsearch.php?q=regallo&amp;ss=2</a></p>
<p>This could only work as a main title and it isn&rsquo;t quite what I had in mind.</p>
<p>I came across the work of Tarek Atrissi, an Arabic Graphic Designer. He has designed some great arabic faces. I&rsquo;ve attached a couple of screenshots of Arabic faces he has developed. Can anyone suggest a latin face that achieves the feel that either of these do and ideally introduces some of the accenting and detailing used in arabic typography.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help on this one.</p>

<p>A variant/hybrid of your ideas would be to use a Latin face -I&rsquo;d say one that&rsquo;s actually not international and narrow but calligraphic and wide- and judiciously add the floating marks characteristic of Arabic, especially the more elaborate ones like the shadda (also called the tashdeed) the hamza the sekoon and the dammtayn. And if you could sneak in some kasheedas (the lengthenings of the horizontal bars within words) that would be great - although you&rsquo;d need a script (and of a certain horizontal rigidity) to pull that off. Maybe Linoscript? Hmmm, that certainly has a French-colonial mien that might be an interesting spin here. But you said the movie is a western.</p>
<p>Regallo seems too nuts and not Arabic enough. If you enter &ldquo;Arabic&rdquo; into MyFonts&rsquo;s search you&rsquo;ll find many designs along those lines that would be better - although many of them are a bit too cartoony for my own tastes. Simran is a nice one - although maybe more Devanagari than Arabic.</p>
<p>Poppl has designed an all-caps face called Saladin -with an Arabic Kufi feel- that might work: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/28272">http://typophile.com/node/28272</a> _
Here&rsquo;s its digital revival: <a href="http://www.canadatype.com/showfont.php?id=99">http://www.canadatype.com/showfont.php?id=99</a></p>
<p>As for Tarek&rsquo;s work, it is indeed distinguished, and seems in some cases inspired by existing Latin fonts, but you might still have a tough time finding a match close enough to intermix seamlessly. Go ahead and ask Tarek directly though! He&rsquo;s very approachable. Maybe some custom font modification is on your horizon.</p>
<p>Oh, or you could use this -pardon my language- goddam amazing piece of work:

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can think of lots of faces that match what you show, but they are techno, rather than &ldquo;western&rdquo;. Eg Table Manners.
Gratuitous accents would only make it look metal.</p>
<p>How about a very heavy (slab) serif italic, with a scriptish flair, like Korinna Kursiv Heavy or Usherwood Black Italic?</p>
<p>For a script font, the classic Legend(e)?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Think there might be a couple of cross porpoises here. Are we talking about Western as in &ldquo;For a Few Camels More&rdquo; or as in not Eastern?</p>
<p>Love the Lionheart, but I especially love the Hebrew/Arabic link from Hrant <a href="http://typophile.com/node/4383">Ine Beerten&rsquo;s font with no name</a>. Only thing with titles is that they might be a bit quick from the readability point of view. In any case, that girl deserves to go far.</p>
<p>Phil Grimshaw&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=204389">Braganza</a> has a super eastern look to a western eye, but looking at your suggestions I could be way off brief - or it may be a little bit &ldquo;done before&rdquo; for you.</p>
<p>Is there a working title to play with?</p>
