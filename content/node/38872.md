  with some issues around how to improve handling of fonts for the Web. Nobody has
  really asked Web designers or font vendors/foundries about their needs.\r\n\r\nI
  have made a relevant blog post and launched two related surveys (one of Web designers,
  one of font vendors).\r\n\r\nThe survey for Web designers/producers is here. I'd
  appreciate your help in getting the word to relevant lists and forums:\r\nhttp://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=wyFVRRqnxAmTypkzThJOkA_3d_3d\r\n\r\nThe
  survey for font vendors is here:\r\nhttp://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=I9LYBFmggGJ8SCTU0u3CtQ_3d_3d\r\n\r\nMy

    Adobe should put a simple sIFR setup tool into Dreamweaver. If that could make
    it into CS5 it will still be available to designers long before the W3C pulls
    off anything new."

    the GoLive team to go for, years ago, before Adobe acquired Macromedia.\r\n\r\nBut
    the matter at hand is that the W3C is likely to go with original fonts on Web
    servers, and might be convinced to go with EOT as well, and that the opinions
    of type foundries and users might be able to influence if (in the case of EOT)
    and how (for both approaches) these things go down.\r\n\r\nUnless the Flash SWF
    format were to become an open format, I don't think SIFR would be considered.
    Plus there are technical considerations as well.\r\n\r\nBTW, what is this \"life\"
    thing you keep talking about, Nick? Seems like I've heard this word before somewhere.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    don\u2019t think that what the W3C wants really matters much anymore. The people
    behind Flash/Flex have their heads screwed on a lot tighter, and may be more likely
    to produce internet standards that designers and consumers want to work with in
    the long run. It\u2019s been six years since XHTML 1.1, and I don\u2019t see the
    W3C moving things forward. What Macromedia/Adobe have done in the same timespan
    is pretty impressive.\r\n\r\n<cite>What I find sad is that now that Adobe has

    don\u2019t blame them. SVG seemed to run into the same problem a lot of commercial
    open-source projects do: when the open-source crowd finally gets commercial support,
    they don\u2019t really contribute enough to make it worthwhile for the businesses
    involved. It makes more sense for Adobe to just stick with Flash and avoid the
    extra headaches."

    and I know what you're saying, but Adobe, MS and Apple have done many things over
    the decade+ of this issue's existence and none of them work for \"The Web\", just
    for their users. why change now? Thus, this survey had little to offer me as far
    as questions I felt like answering. When someone asks, \"What do you, (you type
    designer you), need to know in order to provide a quality font to any user?\"
    Then we're cookin'. We're cookin' now on our own grease, but it'll be awhile because
    the fundament of tool makers had to be replaced with ones who don't lack for ears,
    eyes, noses and throats. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    to get support for original fonts on web servers (via the CSS @font-face tag)
    built into WebKit, which means it will get picked up by Opera, and likely by Safari
    as well.\r\n\r\nSo, fonts on the web are going to happen. It's just become a question
    of exactly how. That's spurs reactions from companies such as Microsoft and Adobe.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I'd like to see an anonymized result from the font vendor survey, as well.
    It seems that there would be a few font vendors, and several publishers, that
    were highly interested in allowing some sort of interdomain access to fonts. While
    this could lead to hotlinking, that is manageable. More interestingly, it could
    create an opportunity for \"font services\" to be provided by the font vendors
    to a client with a lower up front cost. As a person I prefer to buy, but to businesses,
    leases have advantages.\r\n\r\n<em>(p.s. No problems with Win/Firefox 2.0.0.9

    It's more of \"it depends.\" Adobe was a major early supporter of SVG, for instance.
    We have donated big whacks of code such as Tamarin to the open source movement:\r\n<http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200611/110706Mozilla.html>.
    We donated the OpenType spec to the ISO, and currently support adoption of Microsoft's
    EOT as an open standard at the W3C.\r\n\r\nJames: No, I didn't ask the Design
    Observer staff, but please feel free to pass it on. In fact, I appreciate any
    and all promotion of the designer survey - I want it to have as broad as possible
    a cross-section of Web designers. Especially non-typophiles, really.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
