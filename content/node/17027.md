  body: "Just a 'legal' note.: There should NOT be a 'free download' for it..\r\n<em>(
    That means.: The typeface you downloaded is most propably a bootlegged and therefore
    'illegal' copy of 'Trade Gothic'.. Be 'proud' of yourself, but be warned that
    Typophile doesnt really tolerate this kind of 'behaviour', and 'way of thinking',
    over here.. You wont find ( m ) any people on here that are happily celebrating
    with you, that you found an illegal 'free' copy, of a commercial typeface.. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"
