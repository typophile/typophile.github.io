  \"Groceries.\" Not interested in the motion lines on \"Quick\", just the base font.
  Doesn't have to be exact either, just looking for something reasonably close.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    The sign was in the store and is not a prop.\r\nNot certain about Univers as the

    to [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/j_p.htm|Kasse]]
    FLF, a digital version of [[http://typophile.com/node/69556|Modula]], an old film
    font close to Univers.\r\nBut as you asked for \"something similar\", I'm pretty
    convinced Univers (Condensed Bold) might do the job."

    have no idea how many years the signage was in use before the film was made in
    1994. Nor do I have any idea where the store got the sign, who made it, and wheter

    in the movie. The newer signs I posted must be also based on Quick. The only noticeable
    differences are the lighter weight and increased length of the tail on _Q_, and
    a change in upper diagonal of _k_ to a short horizontal section.\r\nDon"

    Lee's Impact of 1965 but it's too fat, too narrow and has less contrast.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CharterOak_5517.jpg]\r\nDon"

    Oak. It was originally produced by the Keystone Type Foundry, which operated in
    Philadelphia from 1888-1917. Charter Oak is shown on in their 1906 specimen book
    https://archive.org/details/abridgedspecimen00keysrich at pages 143 to 145.\r\nBut
    I have found noting that would serve as an upright match to Charter Oak.\r\nAny
    suggestions?\r\nDon"

    be that no upright match exists.

    Black Grotesk is based on an old European(?) typeface called "Newspaper Black." '

  body: "Thanks Rob. Black Grotesk is the closest I have seen so far. It's interesting
    to compare it's italic with Charter Oak and by looking at Black Grotesk's upright
    imagine how it would pair with Charter Oak. The weight and high contrast are reasonably
    comparable. Most letters don't clash too much. The main exceptions are  _S_, _s_
    and r. Clearly in the ballpark as a possible out of the box upright sans/grotesk
    \ to pair with Charter Oak.\r\nDon"
