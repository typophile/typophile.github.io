  to have the guts to lay down the amount my work is probably worth.\r\n\r\nOr maybe
  i have too many sympathy for the clients (don't know why) its like everybody is
  just as poor as i am to me.\r\nWhere and how do i find the confidence to lay down
  shocking but realistic price tags on my work? \r\n\r\nI'm a designer + art direction
  type figure.\r\n\r\nAny tips?"

    and your family / the number of BILLABLE hours you can/want to work in a year
    = your hourly rate.

    so much as a peep about it, and I had expected at *least* one of my clients to
    complain. I think they all knew I had practically been giving my work away.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you just need to do it and get it over with.\r\n \r\nYou'll like the feeling you
    get when you make the jump to where you ought to be. Less self-loathing and more
    focus on quality work."

    you\u2019ll just hate Ayn Rand and be ready to expound about it when it comes
    up at a cocktail party."

    you know you're not charging enough. \r\n\r\nIf the client does a sharp intake
    of breath, you're in the right area.\r\n\r\nIf the client wants you to do it for
    a bit less, so much the better - they won't think you're a money grabbing son
    of a .... they'll just think you're a pro who knows his worth. A bit of negotiation
    does no harm to your credibility - don't be afraid to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

    if only there were negotiations. I find that young Art Directors and Designers
    have no idea how to conduct business. They call, we talk about a project, I give
    them a price, and  either they accept that price, or I never hear from them again.
    No negotiations. It's making doing business a real bore."
