  <BR> <BR>They have a new line of Mac typefaces, 4 sets $99 per set for 150 fonts.
  A couple in the classic set look suspiciously like ITC Benguiat and Eurostyle. Of
  course under different names. They do ask for reviews. Any takers

  body: Yup, these all look like auto-traces of real fonts, with the usual weak pun
    names. &#34;Alps&#34; is an especially bad Helvetica, with the traps of the &#34;M&#34;
    filled in, and a rather ugly &#34;a&#34;. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s too bad they didn&#39;t
    rip off a Centaur, because it would have gone well with my &#34;Digitization quality&#34;
    comparison in another thread, for comic relief if nothing else. <BR> <BR>Another
    very unappealing feature of the collection is the abundance of &#34;Thin&#34;
    and &#34;Wide&#34; variants, which are, of course, Smooshed

    actually require effort. <BR>These bad boys have been weight gained, stretched
    <BR>and re-named.

  body: These guys will be on the wrong end of a really painful lawsuit. <BR> <BR>Clearly
    we see Estro, Handel Gothic, Benguiat, etc. which leads me to believe with names
    like Hanzel Gothic, which is so close to the original that chances are they must
    be aware of the originals and wouldn&#39;t have rolled out such a significant
    offering without licensing the original designs from the rightful owners . . .
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m afraid I mistyped earlier . . . Upon closer inspection of the
    Broadway Rip Off font called Brando, they are indeed simply re-scanned, retraced,
    versions and you can rest assured they may as well cease distribution or claim
    bankruptcy now . . . <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

    only looked at the PDF called classic. It was all I could bear to see.

  body: Yup, lots of poor quality knockoffs. There&#39;s a version of Lithos in there.
    Offhand, it looks like a trace job; if they did pirate the outlines, they deliberately
    added points and messed things up in an attempt to disguise the fact.

    for contributions for his forthcoming &#34;commercial&#34; font collection?  Prior
    to that, he had done a CD with a bunch of knock-off fonts for sale dirt cheap
    in the late 80s early 90s era. <BR> <BR>I wonder if this is the same guy? He said
    he was a software developer who also like marketing fonts. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    <BR>&#34;There is no way I would include any fonts from any developers without
    getting permission.    <BR>  <BR>If anyone needs to see the &#34;permission&#34;,
    I will gladly provide it.  <BR>  <BR>thanks  <BR>macXware &#34; <BR> <BR>So based
    on that, I would say he has permission to make these fonts. no?'

    versions&#41;. <BR> <BR>T

  body: I should add that their previous collection of 1000 TrueType fonts was very
    different in content. They looked like mostly shareware or otherwise low-end display
    stuff. They weren&#39;t knockoffs of well-known typefaces from major type foundries.
