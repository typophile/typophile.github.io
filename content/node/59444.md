    from Blue Vinyl. You would have to tweak the P, and maybe use the U upside-down
    for the N. \r\n\r\nAn old film type, Blippo Bold (see sample), would also have
    been close, but the P would still have needed modification.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BlippoBd_6130.gif]"
