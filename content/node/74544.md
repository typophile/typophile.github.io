body: "Guys, \r\n\r\nI just ran into a problem in InDesign and Illustrator. In short:
  at the end of the line InDesign and Illustrator <strong>imply</strong> a space glyph.
  That's pretty annoying. \r\n\r\nSo I had this portion of code: \r\n\r\n<code>@WORDSEPA
  = [space period comma];\r\n@ALLTEXT = [...all glyphs <strong>including</strong>
  space...];</code>\r\n\r\n<code>feature calt {\r\n\tlookup calt.linefina {\r\n\t\tignore
  sub @linefina0' @ALLTEXT;\r\n\t\tsub @linefina0' by @linefina1;\r\n\t} calt.linefina;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>\tlookup
  calt.wordfina {\r\n\t\tsub @wordfina0' @WORDSEPA by @wordfina1;\r\n\t} calt.wordfina;\r\n}
  calt;</code>\r\n\r\nwhich worked fine in TextEdit or Word 2010. At the end of a
  <strong>word</strong>, the <code>@wordfina0</code> class was substituted by the
  <code>@wordfina1</code> class, while at the end of a <strong>line</strong>, the
  <code>@linefina0</code> class was substituted by the <code>@linefina1</code> class.
  But in InDesign, the second lookup (<code>calt.wordfina</code>) kicked in, not the
  first. \r\n\r\nSo I discovered that InDesign and Illustrator (CS4 and CS5) imply
  a <code>space</code> glyph at the end of every line (including the last line in
  a text frame).  \r\n\r\nI developed a workaround that looks like the following:
  \r\n\r\n<code>@WORDSEPA = [space period comma];\r\n@ALLTEXT = [...all glyphs <strong>not
  including</strong> space...];</code>\r\n\r\n<code>feature calt {\r\n\tlookup calt.linefina
  {\r\n\t\tignore sub @linefina0' @ALLTEXT;\r\n\t\tignore sub @linefina0' space @ALLTEXT;\r\n\t\tsub
  @linefina0' by @linefina1;\r\n\t} calt.linefina;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>\tlookup calt.wordfina
  {\r\n\t\tsub @wordfina0' @WORDSEPA by @wordfina1;\r\n\t} calt.wordfina;\r\n} calt;</code>\r\n\r\nThis
  now works in TextEdit and Word 2010 (where the first <code>ignore sub</code> rule
  kicks in), as well as in InDesign and Illustrator (where the second <code>ignore
  sub</code> rule is used). Of course, a side-effect of this is that typing two spaces
  will make the <code>calt.linefina</code> lookup kick in instead of the <code>calt.wordfina</code>
  lookup, but I think it's an acceptable price to pay. \r\n\r\nHowever, I believe
  this is a bug in InDesign and Illustrator (I've informed Adobe about this). \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Miguel, if you apply underlining to an entire paragraph, the \"final\" space
    at the end of each line also gets underlined ... Much to the dismay of fans of
    underlining.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that has been true for all versions of InDesign."
