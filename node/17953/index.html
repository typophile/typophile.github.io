  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m new around here, and I&rsquo;ve quickly become addicted; the help and suggestions i&rsquo;ve been reading seem great! &ndash; I&rsquo;ve recently decided to have a crack at doing some freelance work in and around the city i live; I&rsquo;ve got a couple of qualifications up my sleeve, one on the computer side of things, the other on the media-publishing. I&rsquo;m intending on specializing in doing websites, posters and flyers for local bands or the general music scene in the city, but at the moment I&rsquo;m taking all the jobs that come my way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with ideas for my logo, i decided not to use my name for the freelance, but a pseudonym, Mallmus &ndash; I feel the logo is clean, and robust; although perhaps a bit too corporate.</p>
<p>This is the current logo i&rsquo;ve decided to use, but i&rsquo;d like some feedback, suggestions and criticism:
<img src="/images/old-images/mallmus-logo.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>This is what i call the Mallmus Wheel:
<img src="/images/old-images/mallmus-wheel1.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>And these are other ideas that i played around with, but i decided were not right:
<img src="/images/old-images/mallmus-logo1.gif" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/mallmus-logo5.gif" alt="">
<img src="/images/old-images/mallmus-logo2.gif" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/mallmus-logo3.gif" alt="">

<p>First off I think you need to explain what image you want to project of yourself, then a feeling of typeface and mark may present itself from there. What does this wheel symbolise?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When i came up my first attempt:
<img src="/images/old-images/mallmus-logo5.gif" alt="">
I was really going for this fun approach, at the time i was working with a friend but she unfortunately quit :'( the idea was a fun easy-going company that small local bands could approach for their printing and web needs &ndash; I felt this version looked too much like a sun; so i progressed it further into what i have now &ndash; Thoughts?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does this wheel symbolise?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted the wheel to symbolize two things, 1) a speaker or perhaps a drum, my long term goal is to specialize and focus on the music scene, and i thought having something which (i hope) looks related to that would be good. 2) overall the wheel, i feel, appears complete and clean, appealing &ndash; Thoughts?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>then a feeling of typeface and mark may present itself from there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does everybody thing of the typeface i decided to use &ndash; to me it has a &lsquo;stage-show&rsquo; feel to it&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I find Revue has a dated appearance, then again maybe it is time to revive it like Avant Garde (although this doesn&rsquo;t have the same potential use). The AD ligature is a bit cramped you might want to increase the space between the lines and try to make a smoother transition. The wheel motif reminded me more of a tape sprocket (after I read of your interest in design for musicians), initially I was thinking of automotive design. 
I think you have the basis of a logo but need development to both elements.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Your original symbol does resemble an old tape or film sprocket, but until tim mentioned it, I couldn&rsquo;t guess what it was. I just had a feeling that I&rsquo;d seen it before. You don&rsquo;t want to be too obvious but you don&rsquo;t want people scratching their heads forever trying to figure your logo out. I actually thought it resembled a steering wheel.</p>
<p>That said, I think the difference in line weight between the outer ring and the inner spokes is too much. They don&rsquo;t have to be the same weight, but right now there is too much contrast and I fear you&rsquo;ll lose the inner detail at smaller sizes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an okay concept, but I agree with tim about the typeface and the ligature. Nail down your logo before trying to find a typeface.</p>
<p>As for the other concepts, they don&rsquo;t work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Mallmus, the typeface you&rsquo;ve chosen looks dated to me. That may be because I&rsquo;m old enough that it has a historical reference that you may not have. Anyway, style is a tricky thing, and certain typefaces are brought around again in a fresh new way, but this isn&rsquo;t pushing it enough to me. I would really explore some other type options, and think about your &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; clients and what will connect with them. If you want to do a lot of work with local bands you have a lot more creative latitude to be more expressive, maybe even have a series of logos. Remember bands are always looking for something that will make them look &ldquo;cool.&rdquo;</div>
