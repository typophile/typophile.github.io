  about to buy the DIN OT Collection but want to be shure it contains the alt Glyphs.\r\n\r\nAs
  for now i use the regular DIN and for the italics the Din Italic Alternate because
  of the closed a's & such.\r\n\r\nWill the OT allow me (tru indesign fex.) to use
  the OTfeatures ea the character alts or aren't they included in the Charset? I somehow
  couldn't spot them in Fontshop's Din OT Charset presentation.\r\n\r\nJust want to
  be shure before spending 600\u20AC\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch,\r\n\r\nGilles"
