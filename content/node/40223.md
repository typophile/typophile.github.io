body: "I'm looking for a display font that conveys the notion of fluid, currents,
  motion, flow of liquid, etc. \r\n\r\nI'm revamping the quarterly print newsletter
  for a nonprofit devoted to advocacy and research around a neurological condition.
  The title of the newsletter is still under debate but will be something about flow/current.
  The organization's logo uses Optima (not my decision) along with a wave-like graphic.
  \r\n\r\nFYI, in the past we've used Slimbach and more recently Minion for the body
  text of the newsletter; I'm not yet sure if we'll be changing that too. \r\n\r\nI'm
  clueless when it comes to readable, modern script fonts, so I'm thinking about a
  really nice italic version of a serif font. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "
