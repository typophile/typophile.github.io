  a few years for at least half the projects, it's time for something different; a
  fresh serif.\r\n\r\nMy shortlist for now:\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/|Calluna]]\r\n[[http://www.typeculture.com/foundry/font_collection/font.php?ID=FNT09_03|Expo
  serif]]\r\n[[http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/verdigris/pk_verdigris.htm|Verdigris]]\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions \u2013 or comments \u2013 would me more than welcome, and appreciated
  off course.\r\nThanks in advance, Brieck"

    So I'm not even gonna ask you for the argument(s) favouring Axpo. Bye, Brieck."

    works like a charm, but never could really make it sing on the page. But perhaps
    it was just me \u2013 or us, for that matter.\r\nGalaxie Copernicus looks promising
    though, I'll take a closer look at that, thanks!"

  body: "Brieck,\r\n\r\nYou don't give more details about the characteristics you're
    searching for.\r\nBased on your shortlist, my guesses:\r\n\r\n1. [[http://www.chastellun.net|Stuart]].\r\nResembles
    Expo Serif Pro, with a more moderate calligraphic feel. It has a lot of OT features
    and a good set of weights. Very readable, although with a clear personality.\r\n\r\n2.
    [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/guardian/egyptian_text|Guardian Tex]]\r\nMore
    cool and neutral, with a huge x-height, it's no calligraphic at all. Maybe one
    of the more legibles fonts available, although it demands more leading to achieve
    this.\r\n\r\nOr maybe you're searching for something different, like [[http://www.typophile.com/node/67787|this
    project]]."

    it was better if you gave more details.\r\n\r\nBesides, I really do suggest that
    you use Expo Serif. It's a very nice typeface."

  body: "Characteristics. Well, I do a lot of work on management books, occasionally
    student's textbooks, etcetera. (So I'll have to look into a sans as well, for
    now my choice would be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/|Din]],
    primarily becaus we already got the set \u2013 but perhaps the budget leaves room
    for...)\r\n\r\nAnyway, it struck me that a lot of books in that field look alike;
    thoroughly but a bit boring in a way. Though I know there's more to it than just
    starting of with a different typeface, I took a closer look at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheque/fedra-serif-b/|Fedra]].
    Somewhat overused perhaps, but more important; I wonder whether it stands lengthy
    reading that well.\r\nThan I came across Expo; it's not t\xF3 dark, with nice
    soft curves and swashes.\r\n\r\nThis morning I did some experimenting with Calluna
    (the Roman is free). And I must say I'm impressed. It handles really easy, runs
    pretty economically (wich is generally appreciated by editors and such) and is
    without a doubt highly readable."
