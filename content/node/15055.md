  body: I think it's custom; I've never seen it before. I like it a lot; sturdy, versatile,
    clean, economical, yet attractive.  One nice touch is the spur on the a which
    appears when needed (text) and in decks but is not present in display cuts such
    as the light. I'd like to see the italics. If anyone has more info or specimens,
    please post.

    just that bit too much, it's harder (for me) to read. This may be caused by the
    stock that today's teaser was printed on, which I felt was too bright (also too
    heavy). Monday's Guardian might not be on the same stock.\r\nThere is also the

    Star, also a leftish paper run by a foundation, rather than a media conglomerate,
    was recently redesigned with all serifs.\r\nSomehow, it signals a pandering to
    \"taste\", a movement away from a hard-line stance, whether or not that is the
    editorial drift.\r\nMy initial impression (which may nonetheless be revised once
    I see it on newsprint) is that the newly refined look will be at odds with the
    necessarily blunt messages that this newspaper, so frequently critical of the
    establishment, must carry."

    with cupped ends (think Goudy, or Worldwide) for example would have been off.

    it along the masthead, so newsagents will have to display it as it comes.\r\n\r\nThis
    also leaves a very dynamic space for a headline or picture that is visible with

  body: "I'm getting used to it.\r\nThe typeface is OK. A bit like Cartier, eh?\r\nPerhaps
    the serifs could have been a bit narrower, in the headline fonts, for a slightly
    closer fit, given the tightness of the layouts and the small wordspace.\r\n\r\nI
    find the G2 section is too small in size. There is a problem that with the smaller
    formats and the larger pictures, the fancy colors and light weights, that the
    paper loses gravitas. This is particularly evident when you have one story dominating
    a page and it's got a big stock photo -- that ain't news! Looks more like a cheap
    magazine: but that is something that the facility to put big colour pictures everywhere
    sucks you into, and unique to the Guardian.\r\n\r\nThe big double-page photo spread
    every day is brilliant.\r\n\r\nOverall, I am still concerned that a serious anti-establishment
    paper should carry some clout. The Guardian was big and tough, but now it is proud
    to leave behind that daunting presence (as charged by focus groups, no doubt)
    to be friendlier -- smaller, prettier. I have the same problem with the little
    Independent and its frilly Century heads. Easy to discount.\r\n\r\nPlease tell

    benefit of the new face is that you don't get the situation that often occurred
    before where an ad set in Helvetica would get mixed up with editorial set in Helvetica.
    In fact, what's happened with newspaper design in the years since the Guardian's
    previous makeover is really quite amazing, now that so many papers have comissioned
    their own typefaces."

    two obstructions have to be overcome time is the major constricting factor, closely
    followed by cost \u2013 the market share for newspapers has been reduced by newer,
    more instant, cheaper and generally easier* media.\r\n\r\n*By easier, I mean why
    bother reading a newspaper when a man or woman in a suit will read it for you
    in the corner of your living room.\r\n\r\nThe technologies involved in newspaper
    production \u2013 printing (colour, inks), layout software, paper manufacture
    etc. have all improved in terms of speed and quality and this is clearly the case
    compared to a decade ago.\r\n\r\nNewspaper's budgets are mainly allocated to the
    content (the reporting) and production. Since even media barons cannot expand
    time, cost is the only area that can be squeezed, so, for example, there is a
    limit to the amount of non-printed space, the remaining number of employees have
    to be able to produce the product.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, if the paper is to survive,
    it cannot afford to lose its loyal readers, who want the content and will not
    pay (much) more, and the consumables and wage bill keep a constant then something
    has to give and that casualty is design. I don't envy anyone trying to redesign
    a newspaper within these constraints.\r\n\r\nTim"
