  the top ten font design styles of 2006: best text font, retro font, ornament font,
  techno, Roman, formal script, handwriting, brush script, grunge, and calligraphic
  fonts. To keep things fair, we let you\u2014the customer\u2014be the ultimate judge
  of results by using sales numbers to decide each winner. Thank you for putting together

  body: That also amazed me! Not even one single serif typeface, suitable for text,
    with great italics, and so on. But if you check MyFonts best sellers you won't
    see many of them. I think the designers only buy typefaces for display use and
    they maybe still use Garamond or Times to set text.

  body: Times for text? I don't think so. I think the script etc fonts sell better
    because they're cheaper, one-offs usually, and often bought by non-designers for
    special projects. Text fonts are an investment so less frequently purchased perhaps.

    what's \"Best,\" (even though the title states differently). Look at what's popular
    in music, a lot of garbage, and the real gems get discovered only by those in
    the know. I designed Zaner 1) because I loved the style and thought it deserved
    reviving in digital format and 2) because I thought it would sell well, as the
    masses buy scripts. I don't think the masses care as much about workhorse text
    faces, unfortunately. Welcome to the market economy.\r\nAll said, it's an honor
    to be included in this list, even if it is a bit of a popularity contest, and

  body: I think this is a reflection of MyFonts' market position. It's the populist
    type site, presenting itself more to casual users than learned designers. Anyone
    not well versed in typography is going to take more to the overt uniqueness of
    a display face than the subtleties in design and craftsmanship of a great text
    face. (Just went through this advising my old college newspaper on their redesign...
    tried to explain why Adobe Jenson is not the best choice for a newspaper.) Plus,
    non-designers tend to think more in terms of individual elements than the whole
    picture, meaning they may see more conservative text fonts as boring, while designers
    visualize the same font in context as rich and expressive. I'm sure that if you
    looked at other resellers, they'd have totally different bestsellers.

    is an exemplary Long Tail company, meaning that most of its sales come from most
    of its products, not the few best sellers. So on the one hand, it hypes its big
    hits in the de rigueur dumbarse manner, but at the same time it makes a huge quantity
    of fonts from hundreds of foundries available. There's quality there, of all kinds,
    to satisfy typographers with the most exquisitely recondite taste.\r\n\r\nMyfonts

    that doesn't mean they have to be <em>made</em> like crap, i.e. designed or drawn

    a little too all-inclusive. I have an \"Antiquated & Distressed\" category in
    FontExplorer that is quite different from most grunge fonts. One font I use from
    time to time is Caslon Antique, it looks slightly weathered/distressed to my eyes,
    but it doesn't strike me as grunge at all. \r\n\r\nI think part of why grunge
    fonts are so popular is that they are a quick means of getting some personality/attitude
    in a project for those not having the talent or time to do it by hand (or mouse).\r\n\r\nNot
    that I'm always thrilled to use them, but some customers of mine are really hot
    on them so I can't avoid them entirely. Most of the time I can take an existing
    \"normal\" font and add my own \"grunge\" to it, generally the results are better,
    I have more control, it's a compromise I can live with."

    came out of the 1990s rock music scene, stuff that's really been manipulated to
    just look dirty and ugly. It was certainly appropriate for that context\u2014most
    of the music was commercial crap that sounded dirty and ugly, as was much of the
    music journalism\u2014but now I just wish that grunge type would disappear like

    see a lot of that. A designer hasn't got a good idea, or doesn't want to put time
