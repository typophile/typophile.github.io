  body: "That looks like a monospaced version of Bitstream's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/prima-serif/\">Prima
    Serif<a>/<a href=\"http://www.gnome.org/fonts/\">Vera Serif</a>/<a href=\"http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\">DejaVu
    Serif</a>, but if it is, I can't find it anywhere.\r\n\r\nGiven that these fonts
    are open source, it's possible that this is a monospaced variant custom-made by
    the user/designer.\r\n\r\nEdit: Found it! It's <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/hartke01/\">Verily
    Serif Mono</a>, based on Vera Serif."
