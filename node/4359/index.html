  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, I started this off in the Script section the other day: <BR> <BR>(see image 1 below) <BR> <BR>It was supposed to have a renaissance feel, but I did some more reading, and came to the conclusion that it was too scripty, since a large part of renaissance type/printing was to move away from the handwritten process. The very beginning though, seemed to be an imitation of handwriting. For this font, I want that feeling to remain, but still look like a jump in the direction towards printing. So, I decided to add serifs to my calligraphy based letters. While it may look like Jenson or Centaur, I'm hoping it has an even more calligraphic feel than both (though slight). <BR> <BR>Earlier in the day I had this: <BR> <BR>(see image 2 below) <BR> <BR>I've been comparing the letters to some renaissance pages in my design history books, and at this point, I've worked my way up to this: <BR> <BR>(see third image below) <BR> <BR>Only a lowercase so far. My hope is that it will be good enough for short to medium length texts.  Please let me know what you think. <BR> <BR>Thanks!  <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the link. I wish I owned one of those books! Some very interesting things in the essay too (hadn't read it before). What he says about Jenson is almost exactly what I was trying to do. I've always admired the borders and layouts Morris did but have never really taken the time to study him (which I will do while working on the font.) <BR>  <BR>Going to make adjustments, and do a bit of work (and reading) before posting an update. If anyone has other comments on the lowercase, I'm still open. I'll mostly be working on an uppercase and numbers for awhile, so I can work back and forth. <BR>Thanks again, <BR>Brian  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.english.umd.edu/englfac/WPeterson/MFP/documents/9.html"> Aims in Founding</a></div>
