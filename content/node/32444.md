  and went with two leaves on the side. Created a two colour version, that can obviously
  work in just black as well.\r\nIm really stuck on the placement of a typographic
  mark with the loogo mark. They need to exist together but I cant seem to nail it
  down. Would love some ideas from the well informed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited Version.
  . . \r\n\r\nChanged to Centennial. .. . still iff'ed out about the placement. "

    first.\r\n- The word spacing is much, much too large in \"Eighth Day\""

    and a bit smaller and a little more space between the type and the logo.\r\n\r\nIs
    that Didot and Avenir?"

  body: "I'm not sure I like Bauer Bodoni. The hairline strokes and the weepy descenders
    don't seem solid enough next to your bold logo graphic. \r\n\r\nCourse, I'm probably
    just being nit-picky. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Asvetic . . . suggestions for an alternative. . . I have tried filosofia but
    it loses the higher class feeling. Didot is similiar . . .?

  body: "Didot would go even more in the wrong direction.\r\nI tried something with
    the logo to the right of the wordmark.\r\nThat seemed to look OK for me.\r\nYou
    might think about doing something to the sublines.\r\nThey will probably become
    problematic at small sizes."

  body: "I was actually thinking Centennial... it's very similar to Bodoni, but more
    modern, cleaner. The strokes aren't as thin and the descenders are nice and straight.
    \r\n\r\nMight be worth a shot.\r\n\r\n"

    see how it came out. \r\n\r\n- you can edit your original post and add to the
    list of documents, that might be why you had difficulty posting new images. "
