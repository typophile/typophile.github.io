  made some ligatures and here is my headache. FontLab demo shows all ligatures, InDesign
  too. I'm looking for any simple application which works with this font (=supports
  ligatures). Very nice BabelPad shows only f_i ligature but not the rest (these important).\r\nAny
  hints? The font will be used by a small community of poor people so InD is not an
  option."

    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant

  body: "Ooh, Chakma. How cool is that!\r\n\r\nThe problem you will run into is that
    Chakma, like other Abugidas, is a 'complex script' in text processing terms, so
    the expectation for OpenType will be that it requires layout engine assistance.
    What this means is that a lot of software will simply not apply OpenType Layout
    features to Chakma characters without the presence of such a layout engine. The
    behaviour you are seeing in InDesign is uncommon, in that Adobe's fallback for
    characters that its layout engines don't recognise as belonging to a particular
    supported script get generic OT feature shaping. Unfortunately, this might only
    help you in the short term, because if/when Adobe do get around to supporting
    Chakma your current implementation will likely be incompatible with (as yet unspecified)
    requirements for fonts to work with the layout engine.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking,
    Microsoft leads the way in defining shaping engine behaviour for complex scripts
    and fonts. It is possible that someone at MS is working on Chakma, or that it
    might be bolted onto one of the existing shaping engines for related scripts.
    On the other hand, like other organisations, they tend to set priorities by numbers
    of users, so Chakma might be very low on the list of things to implement."

  body: By the way, I would expect ligation of signs in this way to be handled by
    one of the non-discretionary features, unless you want users to be able to disable
    the ligation. In the absence of a Chakma spec, I would use the 'ccmp' feature,
    but note that this is normally applied before any other shaping except language-specific
    variants of basic characters.
