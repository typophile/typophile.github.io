  the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest</em> and wondering just what the typeface was. It's a bit
  puzzling to me, as it looks a lot like Corsiva, or Medici, but yet\u2026some of
  the letters don't seem right. Is this two separate types intertwined somehow, or
  just many alternates?\r\n\r\nApologies for the large image, but:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OneFlewOverTheCuckoosNestOpeningCredits_4368.png]\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nTyler"

    perhaps a Photo-Lettering face...
