  find anything.\r\n\r\nWhat is the title font on this webpage?\r\n\r\nIt's not a
  standard web font, so is it a free open font for free use?  How is it being displayed
  here?  Cufon?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    that price allow me to use it on websites?  Multiple websites?\r\n\r\nHow is it
    being dispayed on this site?  Cufon, @font-face, etc?\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Oh yes. Thanks, microspective.\r\n\r\nI didn't even think about Flash, as
    they text is selectable.  I did not know that was possible with Flash.\r\n\r\nI
    will assume that the font licence allows Flash embedding.  But, is that the only
    way that the font can be used on websites?"
