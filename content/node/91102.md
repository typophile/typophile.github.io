body: So I'm laying out a magazine. I really like Optima and I think I'd like to use
  it primarily for body text...but I'm having difficulty choosing a font to couple
  with Optima for display text and the like. I want a dynamic layout. Any thoughts/ideas?

    that doesn't look like Michael Jackson... these days.\r\nSorry for being harsh
    - I just can't stand that vapid hag.\r\n\r\nTrying to be positive: Do you know
    about Pascal? Or Legato?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      as jaded as you regarding typefaces. Honestly I probably won't use Optima at
      this point, but I'm still curious about suggestions. \r\n\r\nChecking out Pascal
      & Legato...."

    one I'd choose.\r\nFor better understanding your needs, however, we should know
    what type of magazine you\u2019re talking about: topic, style, readers, etc.\r\nFinally,
    the Critique section is used for showing samples upon which receive advice. Your
    request would be better in the Design section of the forum."
