body: Hi there, <BR> <BR>I would like to thank everyone for replying enthousiastically
  to my thread on the Scandinavian ornaments. I have now a lot of info I can work
  with. I will use the X-mas days to get started. It will be quite difficult because
  I&#39;ve never done something like that.  <BR>Besides that I will start with expanding
  my Nordic to a complete family with all the weights and widths.  <BR> <BR>I will
  keep you updated when I have something to show. <BR> <BR>Ren
