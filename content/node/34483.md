  would go well with Garamond Premier Pro. I was browsing through some of the fonts
  mentioned here on the forum and quite liked Bickham Script Pro and Avalon but it's
  rather far from Garamond and this logo (the latter could be amended though):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RN_flower_4194.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\nAL"

  body: "Garamond is a rather formal (Classic) typeface, so I am assuming that you
    are thinking of a rather formal script (Bickham and Avalon are a mix, with Avalon
    less formal, in my opinion). However, your logo has a more modern, casual look
    to it (and it's nicely done, by the way). Which way do you want to go? \r\n\r\nFrankly,
    I think Bickham gets overused, especially with the huge swash initials. No complaints
    from me about the regular Bickham though, as a classic script. But if you are
    wanting to find something that might work with your logo idea, possibly Font Bureau
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/sloop/\">Sloop</a> would give
    you a somewhat similar R in an elegant script that I think would go nicely with
    a classic serif like Garamond. This is very subjective, of course. Only you can
    tell if you think they look OK together.\r\n\r\nFor more ideas, you might look
    at Parts 1 & 2 of the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com.ScriptIDGuide.html\">Script
    Font ID Guide</a> for more formal styles and Parts 7 and 8 for more casual styles.
    Another idea is to use Antique Handwriting, as if from the Garamond era of the
    1700's, and for those styles See Part 10 of the Guide.\r\n\r\n[edit: My mistake.
    Garamond is really 1500's, but the idea still applies.]\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    I'm getting bad vibes from using GPP here.\r\nI think you need something more

  body: "I can see both sides. Using Garamond is a nice counter-balance to the casual
    simplicity of the monogram. On the other hand, something more inline with the
    monogram could also be nice, as long as it isn't used at too large a point size
    as I think that would dilute the monogram.\r\n\r\nAs for a script to complement
    the monogram. Will it be used very close to the monogram?"

    to me the monogram is -deservedly- the centerpiece (pardon the pun),\r\nand like
    Tiffany hints (and she would know from recent experience ;-)\r\nit would be nice

  body: "Miss Tiffany,\r\n\r\nYes, the perfect sulution, I guess, would be to have
    two typefaces matching the monogram. Garamond is one of them since I haven't found
    anything better yet. As for your question - no, the logo won't be used too close
    to text. I'd like it to have its own space (the stylised flower partially doing
    this). It might be also used as a watermark behind text.\r\n\r\n_______\r\n AL\r\n<a
