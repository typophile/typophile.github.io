    as there will be more people able to help you over there.

    by typobrand- the same guy of MVB fonts- to design the logo. But if you ask me...
    it looks like Walbaum as a logotype.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "The Octavo site is a different company. That Octavo make facsimilies of old
    books. It was founded by one of Adobe's founders I think. Nothing to do with Hamish
    Muir's Octavo.\r\n\r\nHM's Octavo was a 1980s British design firm. I believe that
    all of its members studied in Basel with Weingart. Octavo made a great typography
    magazine (there is a book version of it for sale now) called 8vo. (I think I have
    all my facts right here). If I remember correctly, the used a lot of Haas Unica.\r\n\r\nI
    wish that Hrant was here to straighten me out on this one!"

    a font which took into account the problems of anti-aliasing and aliasing in on-screen
    typography. It was known as 'Interact' and was based on a grid \u2014 the 45 degree
    line'is rendered by a series of one by one pixel steps.\r\n\r\nHamish Muir also
    has a website, which I guess you can find on google. \r\n\r\nmmmihela \u2014 try
    and buy or borrow from the library the 8vO book 'On the Outside.' You will find
    info on the typeface in there.\r\n\r\nPhil"

  body: '"On the Outside" is a great book about a great design studio. By the way,
    Dan, the name of the studio is indeed 8vo, "Octavo" being the name of the magazine
    (which lasted eight issues). And yes, they used a lot of Unica, but a lot of Futura
    as well (for the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam under Wim Crouwel''s
    tenure as director).'
