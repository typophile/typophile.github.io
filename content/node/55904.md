body: "I got already designed type faces in Illustrator but I need now to implement
  them in FontLab. What I need is to not screw something on the beginning! Like dimensions
  of my letters in Illustrator and dimensions of my letters implemented in FontLab
  like font height, width, ascender, descender etc. Need help or some good tutorial
  or guide for professionals not amateurs!!! cause I wanna do my first font well.\r\n\r\nMy
  font on which I currently working is non serif and modern looking. I need some spacing/kerning
  advices too. I need to make \"my beauty\" right! Help me!"

  body: "Starting with the most important: vertical metrics (it is the \"worst\" to
    correct later if you get it wrong ;)\r\n\r\nIf you work with a UPM of 1000, try
    to import your capital letters around 700 in height in FontLab. This will make
    them pretty \"standard\" in height compared to other fonts.\r\n\r\nAs for spacing
    and kerning: try things out, test it, look at other (similar) fonts and learn
    from them ;)\r\n\r\nThere are some very good articles in the TypoWiki - look especially
    in the \"How-To\" section...\r\n\r\nGood luck! :)"
