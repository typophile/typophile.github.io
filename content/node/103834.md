  characters I need.\r\nHowever, when I'm writing something in Photoshop, it doesn't
  support certain characters, such as \xA1, \xBF, \xD1 and the acute accented vowels
  (to be precise, it doesn't accept anything that is not the standard English set
  of characters). Then I write the text, using the same font, in Word. It's fine.
  I copy-paste the text into Photoshop... and it's fine!\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know why
  this happens? If this helps, I use FontCreator 5.6 to view the characters, and all
  non-standard characters are blue (the standard are green or sometimes red)."

    characters. It's how they show up in one program and not in other what surprieses
    me.

    that can actually use it at all; the "unicode codes" of its glyphs are all between
    0xF020 and 0xF12A (space is 0xF020, you can guess the rest).

    some don't seem all that interested, and in any case they just pop back up. I'd
    point out that for anyone who's time has any value, it is cheaper to license them
    legitimately than to steal & have to create the metrical data, but I guess the
    amateurs don't count their time as a cost.\r\n\r\nThe situation you mention just
    above could have come from someone extracting a font from a PDF file. Newer PDFs
    have protection, but not the older ones. The font data was there in .pfa form,
    without metrical data."

    worked fine.\r\nMy guess is that Word is copying the unicode values to PS, so
    the same gylphs are used. When typing in PS, PS is using the unicode values to
    'find' the special characters or character after the 'z'.\r\nI looked into some
    old TT symbolfonts and most only go up to the 'z'. Only exception is ZapfDingbats.
