body: "!Carlos Caffeinated (TT) has the usual 4 styles: regular, bold, italic, and
  bold-italic. Everything is cool in every program, except the CS2 applications. There,
  there is only regular and bold-italic. Inspecting the file's properties and tables
  I cant find a problem. A free font, this a low-priority problem to solve sometime
  when I redraw the font  (already planned).\r\n\r\nThen...\r\n\r\nMy newest font,
  intended to be my first commercial release, has three cuts with the same basic4
  in each. However, Cut #1 has all 4 in all applications, including CS2. Cut #2 and
  #3 have: Regular, bold and bold-italic. <em>No \"Italic\" (In CS).</em> But, the
  \"Regular\" is italicized. How can this be?\r\n\r\nIn Word's font menu, Windows's
  font preview, and several small font viewing applications, as well as all other
  font developing tools, everything is kosher.I am developing all the cuts side-by-side.
  I've poured over this for days, recompiled, completely re-entered the name fields,
  stopped all other development, re-rendered the italics from the original design,
  scoured the web for a clue, revised the OT naming system, and now I'm all out of
  ideas. Please help."

  body: "I just took !Carlos Caffeinated, and created an outline version. I added
    \"Outline\" to the family name, and it works perfectly!? According to several
    apps, the font folder is a-ok (synced with registry, no errors)\r\n\r\nOk, so
    if Adobe apps aren't just building the font lists from the OT Preferred Names,
    where are they coming from? !Carlos Caff was just a plain TrueType, and I get
    an similar but different partial list of styles on  a PC with PS7 (still problems
    with both faces).\r\n\r\nOr, I am going insane."

  body: "There are a few areas in a TrueType font that are used in 'tagging' a font
    and showing its style.\r\n\r\nAll the 'name' table fields should be consistent
    and correct. \r\n\r\n'fsSelection' in the 'OS/2' table is also used for 'style'
    \r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#fss\r\n\r\nAlso Weight
    is marked in 'fsWeight' in the OS/2 table\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm\r\nAny
    value greater than 400 will be seen as a Bold font.\r\n\r\nThese are the main
    three areas, there are other values in 'head' and Panose values that have weight
    values or style but these don't usually cause problems on Windows.\r\n\r\nQuickly
    looking at the fonts the Bold name table is incorrect. The PostScript name is
    incorrectly formatted and the Weight is set to Regular in both the Bold and Bold
    Italic which is wrong and could cause confusion in Windows.\r\n\r\nThe Unicode
    and Code Page coverage are wrong. And the Panose is wrong. But your main problems
    are the name tables are wrong and the weights are wrong.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I rebuilt all the tables, or deleted them, then recompiled. Installed the
    8 fonts (!CC x4 and !CC Outline x4) on the two computers. All 4 of the Outline
    styles still work on both computers, but Computer #1 showed only Regular and Bold-Italic
    of the solid style. The Computer showed only Bold, of the solid style. So... I
    went and deleted the adobefn*.* files (with Phinney's exceptions) on Computer
    #2. Problem solved on Computer #2!\r\n\r\nComputer #1, which I had previously
    deleted the same files, still not working right. Searched again for stray adbefnt
    lists, emptied the recycler. Still not working right. So, there must indeed be
    some sort of font cache error on my computer somewhere. But the problem seems
    to no longer be with the fonts."
