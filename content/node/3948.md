  body: ' One of the major clients lately &#34;captured&#34; is a big retail chain
    selling over 15000 items ranging from furniture to pipes, from cement to steel
    and glass, basicly everything that has to do with constructions and space refurbishing,
    both for home and for office. <BR>Their existing identity -that&#39;s been in
    use for10 years now- is designed by the company&#39;s president and has something
    of an emotional appeal to him, still he was the one coming forward in search of
    a new visual expresion for the brand, following contacts with identity systems
    and corporate identity manuals from western partners. The identity consists of
    the name typeset in a heavy version of Helvetica, but there is no rule whatsoever,
    so it sometimes ends up typeset in Tahoma or Arial. <BR> <BR>They wanted only
    a slight finetuning to the identity and a comprehensive set of brand usage standards.
    So we decided to preserve the equity by keeping the all-caps logotype. So I drew
    the two versions of the custom lettering and they chose to go with the second
    one put it in the previous soft corners triangle. I am not sure, however, if the
    overall lettering looks decent, to say the least... I am particullary worried
    about M and E... also, does this look similar to any font you know? <BR> <BR>thank
    you a lot, <BR>george // cellsius design '

  body: ' I just remembered: the mark has one pitfall &#40;hopefully not fatal with
    appropriate advice&#41;: <BR>it is going to be used on huge storefronts and has
    to be clear from quite a distance and the bigger the sign, the bigger the unused
    space in the triangle under the logotype...hmmm, how am I going to solve that
    problem? The initial solution &#40;with the logotype used twice at different sizes&#41;
    seems highly unfortunate ... besides, it is not a good choice &#40; from the distinctiveness
    point of view...&#41;, as all corporate identity manuals point out... <BR> <BR>george

    department store Canadian Tire.  Their name is set in distinctive white type inside
    a red triangle.  On store fronts, however, they sometimes have the triangle sans
    the name, and then the logotype in much larger letters beside it.  See here: <A

    becoming the suggested direction...or am I wrong??? <BR> <BR>george // cellsius

    are correct in pointing it to the right. I would also agree with earlier comments
    about the wide m and heavy a, but would add that the e&#39;s look a bit thin on
    the arms. Overall it looks real clean. '
