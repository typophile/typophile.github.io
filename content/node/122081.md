  the first draft of the Cyrillic character set.  I would welcome any feedback and
  suggestions for improvement.\r\n\r\nA few of the glyphs are identical to the equivalent
  Latin forms (which, I understand, is perfectly acceptable) but, as with the [[http://typophile.com/node/121394|recently
  added Greek character set]], I've avoided bolting together segments from existing
  Latin glyphs to create a new Cyrillic one.\r\n\r\nThe first link shows a small sample
  text in Cyrillic; the second is the full character set from this font thus far,
  including Latin, Greek and Cyrillic (but not including small caps, alts etc).\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/2eb0b8d24d.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/c934899649.pdf\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    the Cyrillic characters.\r\n\r\nI see the original version did not have the flare
    serifs characteristic of the current Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nAs for your Greek, the only
    unusual thing is the capital Omega that looks like an underscored O."

  body: "Hi John, I think you probably saw an older version of the Greek character
    set; the underscored /Omega/ has since been replaced with a more conventional
    form.  The underscored style will be retained as an alt.\r\n\r\nAs for the flare
    serifs, this internal inconsistency was not intentional and has been corrected.\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/1eb695813c.pdf"
