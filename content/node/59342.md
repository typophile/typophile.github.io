  from an article that covers the adoption of the Latin alphabet in Turkey. \r\n\r\nAt
  the time, these posters were distributed widely, posted in shop windows and on the
  streets so everyone would grow accustomed to and learn the 'new letters' quickly.\r\n\r\nI've
  searched most online sources but couldn't identify them (neither the serif nor the
  script). I guess a human element is needed here. I'll be so happy to hear any suggestions.
  Thanks a lot in advance.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yeniABC_6491.jpg]"

  body: It's quite interesting how they aligned the lowercase g and y with their uppercase
    counterparts. I've seen this done in store signage, but never in a printed specimen.
    Also, I wonder who the gent in the oval frame is?

  body: It's pretty strange that they didn't factor in room for descenders. I mean
    if this poster was that widely used to educate the masses, wouldn't you want it
    to show the letters "correctly", not baseline shifted?!

  body: "Thanks a lot for your help...\r\n\r\nThe article says that at the time, as
    there wasn't Latin type available, they were ordered from other countries for
    print purposes. On the poster, the Turkish characters <strong>\xC7</strong> (che)
    and <strong>\u015E</strong> (sch) where a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedilla\">cedilla</a>
    is used, are not properly drawn. Instead of a cedilla, it looks an apostrophe
    is attached upside down to regular C and S. That, made me think that they've used
    existing type and manipulated the existing pieces to fix a quick solution (there
    must be a lot of pressure from the top). \r\n\r\nNow that I consider it, the 'hand-drawn'
    option makes sense. I was especially suspicious of the tail of the R (as the leg
    of K). They looked like artistic improvisations to me.\r\n\r\n"
