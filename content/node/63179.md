  thought you folks might like to take a look at. I apologize for the small size \u2014\_it
  was the only image I could find of it. \r\n\r\nBesides the rather lovely \"Romanze\"
  at the top, what really caught my eye was the 'g' in \"Hugo.\" The rest of the letters
  in the name also have a similarly fascinating character to them and I was wondering
  if anyone knew if this is a typeface of some sort or simply hand-lettered.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I tried finding out when this might have been published, and had no luck
    pinning down the date of the composition, but I'd guess 1890's to early 1900's.
    The composer was born in late 1850's and lived to be over 90 years old. ROMANZE
    reminds me of Milton (a.k.a. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/musketeer/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D124%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DROMANZE%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dsingle%26seed%3D22|Musketeer]]),
    though the initial is something more ornate.\r\n\r\n\"Hugo R\xFCter\" does not
    look like any typeface I have seen in any of my books, but it does look like it
    could be hand-drawn (as could the other lettering we can see large enough to read).
    The style seems close to Art Nouveau, or Secession, if that is the right name
    for the period following it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
