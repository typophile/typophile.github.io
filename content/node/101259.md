  body: It looks like <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-1&ffam=Gabrielle%20-%20Regular&fid=7ead79cf9a919a477daa6e9fd6a97a97&fsize=60&text=Jones&fit=1|Gabrielle]]</strong>
    free font by  Dieter Steffmann (Typographer Mediengestaltung, 1999) maybe a bit
    emboldened, or just deteriorated by successive photocopies

  body: "Tim Ryan (Type Revivals) produced a version of Gabrielle, circa 1992. His
    comments state that it was based on a design by Hans M\xF6hrin in 1938 for Weber.
    For a while his fonts were marketed by Agfa/Monotype, but I can no longer find
    them there or anywhere else. Later on, Vertisoft/Soft Horizons cloned the TR version
    as 'Gabby Gauguin' (1993). Dieter's implementation(1999) is a clone of  one of
    these. "
