  body: Given the time period, I would guess that it was painted by hand (it certainly
    looks like it was done by hand) and there probably isn't a digital equivalent.
    That's quite a "droopy" T. You might look at Belgravia [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/belgravia/regular/]]
    as a similar-in-feel font.

  body: "It's a good thing you interpreted the words, because I thought at first that
    the letters were COMA UNMO :)\r\n\r\nThis lettering was certainly done by hand
    based on Mediaeval models, perhaps copied from European churches. \r\n\r\nSurveying
    fonts for similar styles, I see none with a C like this, an E this closed off,
    or a T quite that extreme, but CastleType's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/goudy-lombardy/|\"Goudy
    Lombardy\"]] comes rather close, though it's M is the wrong style. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/faust-text/|Faust
    Text]] from Dan Solo is perhaps the best overall font to match the feel of your
    lettering, but the details are not very close in any font I saw. Other fonts (which
    I did not provide links for) are Elizabeth, Barbara Sisters, Agedage Simple Versal,
    Blackmoor, Cranach and Kardanal. They all have many basic resemblances, but also
    differences in many details, in just these 8 letters you gave us.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "\r\nPerhaps seeing the whole verse would help.  At the time of the renovation
    Springfield had two Lutheran churches and Trinity was know locally as the \"German\"
    church.  German church services were held weekly up until the 1950's.  There is
    a lot of documentation (in german) for the numerous wood carvings in the church
    but nothing on this verse.  The verse is carved into a wood panel and painted
    red.  It has been suggested that this font was used in some of the first hand
    written English religious documents, pre-Gutenberg, but this truly is just speculation.
    \ The first three words are 1-1/2 ft. and the rest are 1 ft tall.\r\n\r\nI hope
    the addition information is helpful.\r\n\r\nFred Fliege\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Come-Unto-Me-2_3998.jpg]"

  body: "I believe you're right that this would be pre-Gutenberg, because Daniel Updike's
    books on \"Printing Types - Their History and Use\" do not show any 15th century
    printing types that look like this, anywhere in Europe, as far as I could find.
    Someone with books about early European manuscripts would need to help us out
    to see if this has a name, but, since it was most probably hand-drawn, that seems
    unlikely. Lettering in those manuscripts that I have seen are generally described
    by their place of origin, or the name of the friar who made the book.\r\n\r\nYou
    used the term 'font', but 'alphabet' seems more appropriate, because I don't think
    the term font (or fount) was used before moveable type was created. \r\n\r\nIf
    anyone digitized anything from such ancient sources, it might be David Nalle's
    [[http://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/medieval/|Scriptorium]], and Aneirin (mentioned
    above) is in his collection. That seems to be his closest font to your lettering.
    He also has [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/formidable/|Formidable]],
    which has a number of similar letters. I still think Faust Text is the nearest
    approximation I have seen. [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm|Dieter
    Steffmann]]'s collection might also have something from this era, but you need
    to click your way through it to find out.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
