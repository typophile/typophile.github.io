  could be the inspiration for Melies to use this kind of type in 1903? Akzidenz Grotesk?"

    is.\r\nWhile there were not many sans typefaces- sans lettering had been popular
    for at least the 50 years before this.\r\n(Also- woodtype). Particulary in circuses
    and other show bussiness posters, the sans was well known and extensively utilized."

  body: "You'll notice that the sans titles are the English (or rather, I guess, American)
    versions, so it was likely somebody different putting the titles together, first
    off.\r\nBut grotesque faces (Akzidenz Grotesk but also many many others) were
    quite common at that date, both in and out of France."

  body: I'd be surprised if those sans titles are hand painted letters. They look
    to me like they could be rearrangeable letters made of card or the like.

    is a page from the Lovell & Gibson specimen of 1846, Montr\xE9al.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LandG_6059.png]\r\nI
    don't know when that square style in the M\xE9li\xE9s title cards was invented."

  body: The square type resembles ATF Poster Gothic, but it doesn't appear in specimens
    books until thirty years after these cards were made.
