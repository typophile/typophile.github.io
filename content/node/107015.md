  body: "Thank you!\r\n\r\nCan you, or someone else, recommend something smoother?\r\n\r\nI
    know it must be a simple sans serif, but I do know what that would be. I can think
    of lots of other 'similar' sans serif fonts, but characteristically, I am looking
    for the typeface specifically from Zero Dark Thirty.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\njs"
