    you want a dedicated subsetting function, that will not only subset the glyph

    Generator : http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator\r\n\r\nThe tool is
    designed to create full @font-face kits but you can upload your TTF, choose TTF
    only as output format and use the \u201CExpert\u201D subset creation tool (which
    is very handy). It only takes 2 minutes so it won't be a huge waste of time if
    it's not what you're looking for :) Please note you have to tick the \u201CYes,
    the fonts I'm uploading are legally eligible for web embedding\u201D check box
    even if it's not the case and you don't intend to use it on the Web. Otherwise
    it won't let you do what you want to do.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n"

    newbie me seems to be missing a way to spot what lies outside the encoding.\r\nYes,
    the glyphs line up with the encoding, but where exactly does it end?\r\nPlus,
    there are usually some glyphs - spacing chars and such - that I want to preserve.\r\nNot
    straightforward, unfortunately. But I'll take a second and third look at it.\r\n\r\n@mitternacht\r\n\r\nYes.
    Overall, the Generator does a quite excellent job. And you can customize it with
    a glyph list, too.\r\nHowever, in some cases it doesn't reconcile the other tables
    - like those that John Hudson mentioned - in exactly the way I want. That's why
    I'm looking for an alternate solution. And just to have it handy, offline, too.\r\n\r\nClearly,
    fonts as a technology are designed with a bias towards growing larger, not scaling
    down!\r\n\r\nA friend of mine sent me a FontForge script that I'm going to play

    misinterpretation, and the text has been clarified. In this context, 'original
    font' meant the font that is placed into the WOFF wrapper, which must be losslessly
    wrappable and unwrappable. A tool that produces WOFF files might perform other
    functions to a font file, such as subsetting, before wrapping the resulting font
    data, but for WOFF purposes it is the font that goes into the wrapper that matters,
    not the font at the beginning of the process. This, as I say, has been clarified,
    and I believe the term 'original font' is avoided."

    have performed any other operations, e.g. subsetting or adding custom data such
    as serialisation, permissions, etc.\r\n\r\nThe workflow would be:\r\n\r\n1. Input
    font, i.e. the TTF master from which the specific WOFF'd font file will be derived.\r\n\r\n2.
    Font data processing, manipulation, augmentation, e.g. subsetting, serialisation,
