  this: http://typophile.com/node/13081 even more confused.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/verticalmetrics_6577.jpg]\r\nHere's
  a picture of the metrics. One question I have is: should the TypoAscender + TypoDescender
  + TypoLineGap equal the UPM size of 1000? I have many other questions but I'll start
  there.\r\n\r\nShould I give up and go back to having it calculate the values automatically?"

  body: "Yes, this is ok (A). Possibly adjust values a bit as described in footnote
    **.\r\n\r\nAnother way (B) is what John Hudson describes in the Vertical Metrics
    How-to:*\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>\"ideal\"
    values:</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TypoAscender = Ascender
    = 750\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TypoDescender = Descender =
    -250\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TypoLineGap = LineGap = 200**\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>maximum
    extensions found in the font/family:</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WinAscent
    = 850**\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WinDescent = -350**\r\nThis
    is the way these values are defined in latest Adobe and Microsoft fonts.\r\nIn
    this case, it is recommended*** to also set the OS/2 table fsSelection bit 7 and
    increase the OS/2 table's version to 4. This will tell applications -- those that
    understand this setting -- that they should use Typo... values rather than Win...
    values to calculate the default line-to-line distance. (Please note that as soon
    as OS/2 table\u2019s version is 4, bits 7-9 need to be set or not set intentionally
    because whether these bits are 0 or 1 has a special meaning. More in the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">OS/2 table</a> and <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">name table</a> specs.)\r\n\r\nSo both ways are possible, but
    for simplicity's sake I intend to either withdraw the PDF or change it so it reflects
    John Hudson's recommendation and Adobe's/Microsoft's practice, i.e. (B) -- much
    easier to describe and understand.\r\n\r\n* Especially see the \"Update to the
    Update to the Update\".\r\n\r\n** If you set WinAscent/WinDescent and Ascender/Descender
    e.g. to 800/-400 or 850/-350 (maybe future additional diacritic letters will get
    taller?), and TypoLineGap to 200, you get an \"ideal\" default line-to-line distance
    of 120%, comparable to setting 10/12pt.\r\n\r\n*** There are fonts that don't,
    and since your values match the equation\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TypoAscender
    - TypoDescender + TypoLineGap\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= WinAscent
    - WinDescent\r\nthere's nothing to worry anyway.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "\"This is the way these values are defined in latest Adobe and Microsoft
    fonts.\"\r\nBut not all Adobe and Microsoft fonts are defined thus, and future
    Adobe and Microsoft fonts may not be, and this ideal/default is also the same
    as it was in Fontographer 1.0.\r\n\r\nAs I think we established some time ago,
    though I'm sure someone will correct me if I forgot, the Windows values were designed
    to inform applications of how much vertical space they have to write, (and erase)
    when composing text of a particular font. Some apps then took that for the em
    and confusion bestrode the issue. \r\n\r\nbvfonts, there are two options for the
    type designer, not as clearly put forth as they could be. \r\n\r\nBoth are based
    first on the principle that the EM is split by the baseline at a ratio of 3 above
    and 1 below. Altering this ratio is done for all sorts of reidealizational purposes.
    And second that line gap is better expressed as \"ideal leading\"\r\n\r\nThen
    one option says; Design your font on the 3/1 em but Put Guides at yyy and -yyy
    and make sure all glyphs Stay Inside the Lines without much if any padding. I
    think this is the \"something to worry about\" option. \r\n\r\nAnd the second
    option says; Design your font on the 3/1 em, make reasonably sized accents and
    other kerns as the y dimension is filled up and down, and then push the button
    for Windows values. And I think <em>this,</em> is the \"nothing to worry about\"
    option, if it's not too late. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: When you say "push the button" do you mean the recalculate button in fontlab
    and use those values for winasc and windesc? Do you think the Typoasc and Typodesc
    values should equal asc and desc in the key dimensions?
