body: Renowned designer Stefan Sagmeister recently, I think, released this new logo
  for Casa da musica. The symbol is generic and refers to the architectural structure,
  but anyway i am wondering about which font was used for the logotype. You can have
  a closer look at the identety at http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_17_sides_of_a_cultural_ide.php[img:sites/default/files/old-images/casadamusica_logo_6544.gif]
