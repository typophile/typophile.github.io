  on the 3 samples?\r\n\r\nIm working on a Western theme with a modern twist\u2013
  looking for some really solid headline\r\ntypefaces with a modern twist (not overly
  western serif cliche). Thinking modern Wood Letterpress faces,\r\nlike the third
  sample, with that slightly bleed edge feel. Im wondering if 'Baltic' has had post
  treatment.\r\n\r\nAny solid contenders out there for Wood Letterpress?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help!\r\n\r\nAny suggestions most appreciated, cheers\r\n\r\nJason\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/X_fonts_5724.jpg]"
