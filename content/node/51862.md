  It's incredible how helpful you guys are! I have learned a lot about type here,
  and whenever I have a question I make a search and usually find my answer.\r\n\r\nWhen
  I pair fonts, I usually go with my instincts, and the forum confirmed my method.
  I followed some advices from here to select fonts to pair with [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=amasis&x=0&y=0|Amasis]].
  It's for a data visualisation company. We will be building wireframes and all work
  documents with those fonts. The sans serif needs to be neutral, have many weights
  options and be eligible in small size.\r\n\r\nThis is what was worth testing so
  far:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/testpetit_5823.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you
  have other fonts to suggest? What do you think of my picks? \r\n\r\nThanks a lot"
