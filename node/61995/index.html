  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Since the <a href="http://typophile.com/node/61385">previous topic</a> became too hard to follow I decided to start a new one to gather some feedback from you. If you are interested in the whole process please read the <a href="http://typophile.com/node/61385">first topic</a>.
<em></em><em></em>
<strong>SUMMARY</strong>
Simplease is a User Experience Company located in Austria. The company delivers simple solutions for all kind of Application Software and Websites/Web Applications.

The finished logo should on one hand represent the company and on the other hand be simple enough to use in footers at very small sizes. To achieve this goal I decided to create a wordmark only. The letters are custom-made characters mainly based on Futura Bold and Helvetica Neue Black. By replacing the capital "S" with a small caps "s" I was able to balance the logo better then in the previous versions. Removing the dot of the "i" was the logical consequence.

Last week's process: Brand new "s"; Refined "a", "e" and "p"; More slender "i", "m" and "l", wider tracking to improve the reproducibility at smaller sizes
<em></em><em></em>
<strong>STATUS</strong>
At this time I dispense with colors and concentrate on a proper kerning as well as the right clear space.

I would really appreciate your feedback on the current version.

The "i" also starts looking a hair short compared to the initial "s" (due I think to antialiasing) at the smallest size. Other than that I think it's working really well, it's evolved nicely.</div>

To my eyes the "ea" looks just a bit too big. Also if I scan the word from the left to the right, all is good, balanced and consistent until I hit the e-a. It suddenly feels like I hit a hole in a ground, e feels sagging below the baseline, too much whitespace between e and a, the inner neg space in e looks too small compared to the neg space in other letters, especially the a .. 

Having started at it for a while, I think the problem lies with the a. Try putting your finger over the a on the screen. To me the whole word starts looking far more consistent after that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>@epsilicon:</strong> Since I'm already working on "Simplease" for many months now, I've tried it in all kinds of different typefaces -- just for fun, without having a certain idea in mind -- and figured out that "e" and "a" are a nice couple when it's a double-story "a". They are nicely linked to each other, and that's exactly my "problem". If you look at the current version the whole word feels like it's seperated into three parts (maybe that's just something I see or imagine to see). This effect is caused by the negative space between "m" and "p" and the negative space between "e" and "a". They appear like little gaps but without ruining -- seperating -- the whole word. The idea is that these gaps are kind of subliminal hints for the words "simple" and "please" because you can read "simple" and then stop, and you can start at "p" and read "please". It's the way how the two words are perfectly combined within "simplease" that makes it part of my concept to make those subtle seperations. Another part of my concept is the single-story "a" which communicates -- at least that's what it's supposed to do -- simplicity. To not make it to scientific I decided to add a Helvetica-like "s". In my personal opinion the removed dot of the "i", the single-story "a" and the subtle seperations make it more logo and less text. Btw: the "l" is almost the geometrical center which might help grasping the gestalt.

Well, that's my concept and if you think that "e-a" will never work with a single-story "a" I must make some confessions to improve the overall appearance but if you think that it might work I would like to do some more tweaking since I've already sold myself on the concept. You've called it nit-picking and I actually wanted it to work for customers and look nice to experts as well. Maybe the question is: Should form follow function? If yes, at what costs? Is the concept worth staying with a single-story "a"? Do you perceive it as typographically nice or as something that still has some mistakes?

I'm looking forward reading more thoughts on this work and want to thank you a lot for sharing your knowledge which makes this forum my favorite online-place to be.</div>

Basically I've changed every single letter. From almost invisible changes like on "s" and "i" to tremendous changes like on "a" and "e". The whole word is set in a tighter leading to make it easier to perceive as one. To compensate the amount of negative space caused by "ea" I made some sublte changes to "s" and "e" to get about the same amount of negative space between them like between "e" and "a". Letter "a" looks more solid now but also feels less bold like in the previous version. Letter "e" now feels more like the Futura "e" which helps reducing the gap in between itself and "a".

LOL. I can so relate to that :-)

Whatever the tweaks you did to s and e, I think they are working. The wordmark now looks way more uniform than it did before. If you have absolutely nothing else to do, I would probably try it in a bit heavier weight.</div>

To come back to an older suggestion I've tried to bring in a "double-storey a". The final and the bowl are following the restrictions of "s" while the counter was designed to balance the whitespace of "e" and "s". The stem is like in "p" and the "single-storey a".

This is only a mock-up I've uploaded to get some feedback on it, so I can more easily appraise which way to go. So, which version would you prefer?

In my opinion the current double-storey a-version looks so much better than the other one thus it beats the idea of having a single-storey a, which communicates simplicity. Nevertheless the round a looks interesting. Can you help me on picking a better one.

		<div class="commentbody">Underneath you find the current double-storey a version. I'm not sure the tweaks are 100% there but as you can see in the illustration, there is a nice progress going through the whole word. Let's just omit the initial "s" for the beginning. The "simple" part of the word is basically straight lines that receive more round parts, the closer they get to the "please" part, which basically consistes of round shapes. Especially the passage "ple", where both words meet, works perfectly as a transformation from straight and edgy to soft and round. As you can see in the illustration "ple" looks like straight, half-round, straight, round which feels well balanced to me. To come back to the initial "s"; together with the last "e" it helps the whole word to be equally balanced at both sides.

Do that and I think you're done.

Yeah, and I agree with penn that slanted cuts in p and m are a very nice touch. Small change that really matters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you so much for your comments, I appreciate them a lot.

The "i" and "l" are exactly the same width, but you're right, due to rasterization artefacts "i", "m" and "p" have strangely blurred left sides which let them appear wider then the "l".

Regarding the pregnant "a" ;) What a great observation, thank you for this. I was working on the double storey a for quite some time and was unsure to tell what it is that makes it look a bit strange -> turns out it was pregnant. Basically I've enlarged the counter and played around a bit with the outside rounding. I hope it works better now.

After I've stared at the word for some hours (without tweaking around), I felt like there's a little problem with the "s" looking a bit lopsided. I think it's balanced better now. I also did some subtle changes to "e's" eye.

There is something left I have to mention because I'm so happy that it worked: The center of the "l" is the exact center of the whole wordmark.

I'd like to thank you again for sharing your knowledge. I've also included a <a href="http://www.simplicious.at/stefan/02-10.pdf">PDF-File</a> for zooming in and out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">With the original you mean the first version? If so, that's the earliest version I could find on my computer. Since overlapping doesn't make too much sense because of the completly different tracking I just provide you an image with both versions sharing the same x-height. Look at the original "s", I can't believe that there was a time when I thought this looks good. I keep my fingers crossed for the final version not to look as funny as the original in six weeks from know.

		<div class="commentbody">To be honest, at first glance i think i prefer the first version. Its so much easier and simpler to read. The second version may be more correctly spaced and theoretically proper but I find the tracking painfully slow and the body is over-worked - its actually more of an effort to read.

I haven't read all the posts above but that's just my immediate impression on reading the post above this.</div>

<cite>"Its so much easier and simpler to read."</cite>

This sounds like something I want to achieve. Especially your statement about the painfully slow tracking and the fact that the latest version is more of an effort to read, is something that is very thought-provoking.

Regarding to your feedback I've tried some different trackings. None of which is as tight as the tracking in the original version but I think that's about where I can go without having the effect of logos like <a href="http://scottandnan.com/crate%20and%20barrel.jpg">Crate&Barrel</a>.

I'm not sure what you mean with "the body is over-worked", but I hope it isn't overworked anymore with a tighter tracking.
