body: Vermont native Ron Arnholm developed a love for type being around so many monuments
  in the Granite State. He studied under [[Paul Rand]] at [[Yale]] and has taught
  at the University of Georgia for several decades. A consummate craftsman, Arnholm
  will sometimes take 10 years or more to develop a typeface to the point that he
  is happy with it. He has several typefaces to his credit, but his most successful
  font families are Legacy and Legacy Sans.
