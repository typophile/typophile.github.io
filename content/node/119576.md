    be dead certain):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/chevalier-lt/\r\n\r\nAnd
    Aphrodite Pro is more likely for the names (slim might be too wimpy for letterpress
    at smaller sizes, and I didn't realize there was a pro version with the swash
    alternates):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesenses/aphrodite-pro/\r\n"
