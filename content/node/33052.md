  5 and the add component option. In the menu it is \"grey\" so i can't use it, but
  i've found out on a topic here that i can copy a glyph as component. Now the problem
  is, i can't move the element i past as component, i have to do it in the original
  glyph, and that's a real problem... i can't imagine there is no other option, since
  it was working perfectly in FL4.6\r\nI don't why the normal add component option
  is not working.\r\nI hope you have some tipps for me.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
