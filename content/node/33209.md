  been made any type of modifing to the Helvetica making it a serif?</em> That would
  be a fun project to take care of if it never has been done yet. Simply putting some
  serifs to the original structure."

  body: "Sounds like an interesting idea, but I don't think it's been done. Snapping
    serifs on to the letters wouldn't be that hard, but making them look good and
    still be recognized as Helvetica is another matter.\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing
    has been done with other fonts, or at least remarkably similar fonts in sans and
    serif versions (e.g. Avant Garde and Lubalin Graph, or Officina).\r\n\r\nI do
    recall a magazine article featuring design challenges (I think it was HOW, in
    a mid 1990s issue somewhere) featuring a redesign of Helvetica Italic that looked
    very nice, but I have no idea if that design was ever released as a font."

    designed by Phil Martin in 1976. Not completely successful, in my opinion. A better,
    similar font is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=serifa&x=0&y=0">Serifa</a>,
    designed around the same time by Adrian Frutiger. It is basically Univers with
    serifs.'
