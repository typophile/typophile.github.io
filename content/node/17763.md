body: "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a logotype for a new restaurant in Portola
  Valley called Amigos Grill. It will be a high-end taqueria with a modern, warm atmosphere
  that feels Mexican but doesn't overdo it on the Mexican kitsch. I have a basic idea
  of what I want for the logotype, but can't find a face that fits. I've scoured FontShop,
  but can't find the right face. I'm thinking of a bold display font, that feels a
  bit like a script font (meaning it has some subtle cursive elements, but also has
  a blocky Western feel. It should feel modern with a hint of retro. I'm thinking
  of adding a hard drop shadow for dimension and perhaps some ornamentation, kinda
  like Mexican papel picado. Here's a sketch of what I had in mind. Does anyone out
  there have any suggestions of what face might be appropriate? Any help would be
  appreciated. Thanks. Juan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amigos.gif]"

  body: Very nice suggestions -- especially Juicy, GeeType and August are quite unexpected
    but totally on mark. And Blockhead is such a refreshing alternative.
