  that there is a huge difference between the Cyrillic \"\u041A\u043A\" and the Latin
  \"Kk\". I want to ask what exactly is the difference between them. \r\n\r\nI see
  that in some typefaces the only difference is that the stem of the lower case \"k\"
  is shortened to the x-height - is this the only difference? \r\n\r\nAnd can I use
  the Latin \"Kk\" in a Cyrillic typeface? And what would be wrong if I do as I suppose
  only type designers would spot the difference? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance \r\n\r\n"

  body: Before designing for an unfamiliar writing system, it is necessary to gain
    some understanding of the idioms of particular styles. Just as, for example, the
    shapes and deatils of Latin letters have different characteristics in different
    styles, by which we recognise and classify those styles, the same is true of Cyrillic.
    I recommend that you spend a lot of time looking at different Cyrillic type specimens,
    identifying different styles and noting the major idiomatic features of those
    styles. There will be, of course, exceptions to the major idioms, but it is best
    to gain an understanding of the general patterns before exploring novel combinations.

    what Maxim Zhukov says (tongue in cheek): one designs for one's peers.\r\nAnd
    here he is at TDC's Cyrillic seminar a few years ago.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Maxim_5999.png]"
