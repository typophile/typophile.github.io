More looking for ideas for the typeface; placement sizing and all but suggestions and comments on the mark are fine too. Thanks.

<p>To me, your effort is either an intentional blurring of the Ultramar automobile service station mark and your driving school mark, or perhaps just by chance the two expressions are very much alike.</p>
<p>Either way, I hope the driving school as a seperate and privately owned company will push for their own identity. Which in turn will push your <em>own</em> creativity.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hiroshige: First of all I&rsquo;ve never seen the Ultramar logo before so it&rsquo;s definitely not intentional. I did extensive studies on eagles and this pose is far from unseen. I felt it was a strong enough posture without being completely aggressive as seen in a hunting/fishing posture. I did a lot of sketching before coming up with this one. I had some ideas for doing just a head but that&rsquo;s been done (USPS) and didn&rsquo;t want it to be too abstract either.</p>
<p>Asvetic: Well it&rsquo;s not really &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; as they are the same typeface&quot; but I will try using a sans. I&rsquo;ll see if I can find a nice complementary face. As stated before I don&rsquo;t think a name change is possible. Name&rsquo;s been around for around 10 years and I&rsquo;m not sure the client is too huge on a completely new logo direction either but I think what I have so far isn&rsquo;t too extreme.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still open to ideas and will try to incorporate some. I just know some of the ideas may not fly so sorry for my hesitance.</p>

<p>Tylor, a different expression would greatly improve the mark. Also, consider using the bird&rsquo;s wing span to help emphasis the expression of &lsquo;Free&rsquo;. By appling your idea of white head and neck plummage on the tail feathers as well will help enhance the wing span.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>I want to second Hiroshige&rsquo;s suggestion for a wider wingspan &hellip; that&rsquo;s what was in the original, and while needing refinement, it worked well.</p>
<p>Your second font choice is much stronger.</p>

Ok I&rsquo;ve been tweaking the eagle a bit, tried to address the feet issue. Plus some other minor stuff that was bugging me. I think I still have some work to do on it such as the feet now maybe don&rsquo;t look as &ldquo;casual&rdquo; as you&rsquo;d expect with the words free.</p>
<p>I will try out a more &ldquo;soaring&rdquo; eagle for the sake of trying it out. We&rsquo;ll see how it turns out.</p>
<p>Also I have used a sans face now on the lower part. How does this typeface look? Better suggestions?</p>
<p>Thank you all for your comments and suggestions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Myriad being a humanist sans has a lot of character. I was thinking of more along the lines of a Gothic that would accentuate your font choice for FREE EAGLE instead of competing with it. FREE EAGLE is the most important part of this logo. DRIVER EDUCATION LTD is just a description of what service FREE EAGLE performs.</p>
<p>This is Freight Sans, but you could use any gothic sans like Trade Gothic, Franklin Gothic, Avenir, Gotham&hellip;</p>
<p>I also reduced the size of DRIVER EDUCATION LTD, again so it doesn&rsquo;t compete with FREE EAGLE but in fact accentuates it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Asvetic: Very nice edit. I&rsquo;m still learning continually about typography and design and had this strange idea that I had to use two fonts together that were almost identical just one being sans and the other serif. I&rsquo;m still unsure of how the relationship between two fonts that go well together is but certainly like this idea. Secondly I didn&rsquo;t think of making it smaller like that and having it NOT line up with the edges of the &ldquo;FREE EAGLE&rdquo; but I think that seeing as Free Eagle is the name of the company and Driver Education LTD just describes what they do it&rsquo;s a very nice adjustment.</p>
<p>I will continue to update and tweak this until there are no further adjustments needed.</p>

I went in quite a new direction and this thing has been sitting around for a while. I&rsquo;m trying to wrap it up as the client wants to start using it for some stuff. Any final suggestions? Sizes, placement, other? You guys have been very helpful so far. Thank you.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Now that&rsquo;s a FREE EAGLE soaring gracefully!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest either shrinking &ldquo;FREE EAGLE&rdquo; and the subheader slightly. There&rsquo;s a bit of competition between the image and the text that&rsquo;s unsettling.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of the colors however. The seagreen and yellow don&rsquo;t work for me. I can&rsquo;t think of anything right now, but would recommend watching a sunset to get some inspiration.</p>
