  body: "Watchmakers use their own numbers as a way of making their watch faces look
    distinctive.\r\nThese numbers are in the general style of Eurostile Extended \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EurostyleExtended2Numbers_5762.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/eurostile/\r\nThe simplified treatment of
    some of the numbers, such as _3_ and _4_,  is found on some of the sci-fi and
    techno fonts\r\nThe MAURICE LACROIX wordmark is loosely derived from Avant Garde
    and similar fonts. consider for example, Hurme Geometric Sans No.3 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/HurmeGeometricSansNo3AsMAURICE_5221.gif]

  body: "To complete Don's answer, definitely bespoke and \"Eurostil-ish\" with a
    techy vibe, softly rounded and with some unicase treatment (/M and /N at least).
    Unfortunately to me, it's not so creative nor original as many industrial manufacturers
    (including high-end watch manufacturers) often use variations on Eurostile probably
    thinking it could evoke \"sports\".\r\n\r\nSome related topics with similar \"eurostile\"
    digits:\r\n- Max Bill's clock: http://typophile.com/node/95364\r\n- Alfa Romeo
    dials: http://typophile.com/node/107411\r\n- Rolex chronograph: http://typophile.com/node/123362\r\n\r\nHaving
    a look to [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Typodermic|Typodermic Ray Larabie]]
    font collection might worth a shot (Korataki, Uniwars, Venacti, Sui Generis, Good
    Times, From The Stars...). 'Techno' DaFont sections [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Sci-fi]]
    and [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304|Various]] would be very interesting
    to explore as well.\r\n\r\nSome clients for customization mainly gathered from
    previous discussions around Eurostile: <strong>[[http://haroldsfonts.com/portfolio/metro-df|Metro

    Eurostile), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/reversal|Reversal]] (another
