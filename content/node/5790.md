  body: Do you think that&#39;s a font? It kinda looks hand lettered to me. <BR>The
    characters are quite organic and do exactly what the  <BR>designer wanted them
    to do.

  body: It reminds me of Chuck Davis&#39;s <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/chuckdavis/denise.shtml"
    target="_blank">Denise</a> at Letterhead Fonts, but it looks custom. It could
    be a font with swashes that has been set along a path and/or distorted too, but
    as usual, when there are no duplicate letters, telling if it is custom is mostly
    guessing.

  body: Hey guys, thanks for your input.  You&#39;re absolutely right...when there
    are no duplicate letters, its hard to know if its a font or custom lettering.  I
    thought the V and the L looked similar to the fonts used for Tim Burton&#39;s
    Nightmare Before Christmas, but I&#39;m not to sure. <BR>I appreciate your help
    Mike and Yves...My quest will continue and if I happen to find something out,
    I&#39;ll be sure to post it here.

  body: wow, you&#39;re right...I never knew the album cover was the same as this
    book&#39;s cover... <BR> <BR>no luck yet on getting the name of this font, though.  I&#39;ll
    keep trying!

    you&#39;re going to have much luck...
