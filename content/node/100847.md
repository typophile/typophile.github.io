  body: 'Hard to say. Very blurry, many details have disappeared. For the rest, it
    looks very generic, no really distinctive letters. Some that could do the job:
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-pro/|Akzidenz Grotesk
    Condensed Bold]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/rama-gothic/|Rama Gothic
    Exapanded Semi Bold]]'

  body: yeah figured as much. That is why i had a hard time. But I just used IMPACT
    and that seemed to work pretty well. Thanks :).

  body: Totally agree. Impact was also on my first list as [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/haettenschweiler|Haettenschweiler]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/helvetica+inserat/fonts/|Helvetica Inserat]],
    decided not to finally select it because of the too much off overall design (counters,
    outlines and /R).
