  body: "I originally read your title as \"Heading from 1930s German textbook\". If
    it's from 1930, the font is probably Antique Old Style, the precursor to Bookman.\r\n\r\n

  body: Thanks Lex. It does indeed look like Antique No. 7 old style. I feel a bit
    silly now, especially as I have a reprint of a Miller & Richard specimen book
    sitting on my desk.
