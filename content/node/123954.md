body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on some type design for a flag for
  my thesis show. Both the sans and serif are bespoke. The high contrast serif was
  very loosely based on Times New Roman and infused with the Didone theme. While comments
  on any of the characters would be greatly appreciated, I am struggling with the
  numeral nine. Can it deviate from the vertical axis, reflecting Times? Or, should
  it conform to the vertical axis? (Both nines are preliminary as well as the metrics.)\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much!\r\nWill"

    hook of the nine. It seems like the angle isn't quite right. \r\n\r\nI'm torn
    because I like the variety the swash introduces, but it isn't fitting in, imho. "

  body: "Thanks synaes,\r\n\r\nI was initially attracted to the nine on the diagonal
    axis and was trying to make it work, but you're right, the vertical nine is most
    suitable. I tweaked its overall form, focusing on the right stem and the bottom
    curve and bulb. I also thickened the join in the center (I'm not sure if this
    works).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flag_4412.jpg]"
