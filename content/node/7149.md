body: Dear Mac OS-X folks, I don&#39;t know if this is an Adobe issue or an Apple
  issue.  I seem to have lost many of my keyboard commands--command/spacebar/ for
  zoom, shift for constrain, and others.  This goes for all Adobe apps.  I may have
  accidently hit some keyboard command that zapped them but can&#39;t get them back.  Please
  help? <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: Chris, check underneath the mouse/keyboard settings in your system preferences.
    Not sure if our problems are the same, but mine was resolved through this.

  body: Tiff, <BR>Thanks! that worked.  At first it didn&#39;tr when I hit the button
    to return to default settings but after I rebooted, all was fine.  I just wish
    I knew how I screwed it up to begin with so I can avoid it. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: Chris, it could be some, if you have any, third-party applications. Sometimes
    stuffit deluxe, liteswitch, maxmenus, atm, quicksilver, and etc. can cause some
    mixups. Glad that was all you needed. <BR> <BR>rob
