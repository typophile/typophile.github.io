body: "Just for fun, I was trying to set a downloaded free book with Gentium Plus.
  If I print it at all, it would be on A4.\r\n\r\nI probably didn't notice a ton of
  issues, so any comments are welcome. One thing I did notice though: The second and
  third paragraphs on the RHS start while we're still at the drop cap. The way I did
  it now, there's actually no paragraph indent, but an extra indent there seems silly
  as well. How is this usually solved?\r\n\r\nHenk"

  body: My original question still stands. Cleaned up my page lay-out a bit and let
    the dropcap hang in the margin slightly. Also using Secca instead of Museo for
    the titles. Here's another page (without the paragraphing problem though). With
    excuses for the image quality. Is it impossible to attach pdf's in a reply? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_4409.jpg]

    Indesign, Incopy, Inpage, PageMaker, Qurakexpress?\r\n2. What is wrong where?\r\n\r\n@
    Is it impossible to attach pdf's in a reply?\r\nYou can replace the earlier one:
    \ delete + attach new one.\r\nHowever, the image is good enough. Do not trouble
    yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I use LaTeX, but I don't think that has anything to do with whether to insert
    a paragraph indent or not?
