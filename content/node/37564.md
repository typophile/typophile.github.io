body: "I just bought Taschen's \"Book of Plants\" that is full of old botanical illustration
  plates. I am in love with the style of writing used to identify the plants. Does
  anyone know if there is an existing typeface that is based off of this, or looks
  similar to it? There are a few different styles, however the one I am interested
  in looks like this photo. (please excuse the quick tracing job). \r\n\r\n[[http://i22.tinypic.com/1jqis3.jpg]]"
