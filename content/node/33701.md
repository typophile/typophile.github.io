  in polishing the site, perfecting it.  The site linked to is only a dummy site.
  \ None of the navigation works as it will on the final site.  Just click on the
  left side of the page and that will take you to the next page. I have the cover
  page, the table of contents and one gallery page posted. \r\n\r\nIt is meant to
  look like a magazine or photographic journal.  The descriptive text will change
  so don't worry about how that looks as far as kerning goes but I would like to know
  how you like the overall layout. On the gallery pages there will be a remote rollover
  thumbnail off the page numbers to navigate by.\r\n\r\nI never could decide which
  weight of Titling Gothic would work in this layout so I just used Alternate Gothic
  No. 2 which I already owned.  \r\n\r\nPlease critique any element of the design
  and type.  I would like to hear what you think about the logo also.  The font used
  for the symbol is very apropos for Nantucket as we have the largest deer population
  per square mile in the state.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.acksite.com/testsite/index.html\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSharon"

    not in the best practice whatsoever to paste large images and then image map them
    out for various links, etc. \r\n\r\nIt's early so Ill throw some stuff in your
    direction. . . \r\n\r\nNot sure about the \"volume 1 first issue\" perhaps you
    can incorporate it elsewhere without that unsightly white box. Perhaps you can
    centre the whole page, and drop the white box and text (therefore no white box)
    into the white area. Lot's of empty space that shows off the photograph which
    to me is both good and bad. The navigation page is pretty. . . but sort of lacking
    direction and ease of use...Again I know it's not final, but I dont really know
    where Im going or what Im clicking on. '\r\n\r\nWhy so we want to make it look
    like a magazine? The web and print are two different beasts, and crossovers can
    happen, but for example all those numbers, page numbers, thats decoration,  not
    function, and if anything it might lead people astray. \r\n\r\nThe page LOOKS
    great, very well laid out, but its ease of navigation, coding, etc. are iffy.
    The typography looks nice, but guess what, the web and typography are also a different
    beast. Fonts are limited unless you build a flash driven site. The layout you
    have created could work for a complex table based site (although I prefer CSS)\r\n\r\nThe
    centered text on far right, news and shows. . . ick, everything else is fl/rr.\r\n\r\nSo
    yea I like it, its pretty. But for a real website thats coded instead of a simple
    jpeg image, it will rather different. The typography for starters. Look forward
    to seeing the final. "

    web site. The thing with photography web sites is that they realy are best done
    with as minimal design as needed to let the photos shine through.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks James and Darrel.  I actually find your comments encouraging as they
    confirm some of the areas I've had misgivings about.  I realize that not having
    the real navigation in place was probably a mistake in putting this up for critique.
    \ I'm encouraged that you find it attractive.  It will be flash driven, but I'm
    not doing the flashing so I can't post examples.\r\n\r\nJames, I agree with the
    news/show area...ick is right! I'll fix the white box.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the
    critiques.  I really appreciate them.\r\n\r\nSharon"

    and a great place is given to it.\r\n\r\nThis website is not for a bank or institutional
    service.\r\nOf course, the layout is not usual. but I don't think it's a problem...\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I really like the type treatment on the homepage."

  body: "Heads up on the Flash. You might get some backlash. The photographers I've
    worked with seem very gullible/interested in google search engine rankings. One
    of the most popular photoportfolio sites, LiveBooks is pure Flash and I guess
    they're getting a lot of heat from their users because google isn't picking up
    any of the content off their all-flash sites.\r\n\r\nThe other issue that I think
    is an issue for any photographer looking for contract work is that flash sites
    are quite often not bookmarkable. It can be nice to be able to bookmark specific
    images to pass around to internal designers/art directors who might be considering
    the person's work."

  body: "Darrel, I'm planning on using this as a marketing tool to designers, gallery
    owners and art patrons. I don't see web based photography sites as being all that
    great a way to sell your photos. Photography looks a lot different on a monitor
    than it does printed. Some of my best work looks pretty crappy when reduced to
    486 pixels width.\r\n\r\nI'm sending out direct mailers to the above mentioned
    people inviting them to view my online gallery. That's why I'm using the magazine
    layout. I want to express a point of view and a connection with what I feel is
    important about Nantucket. \r\n\r\nI hadn't thought about the bookmarking. That's
    a good point and I'll have to think about how I can address it.  Maybe a section
    of downloadable small jpegs.  \r\n\r\nThanks so much for your ideas and wisdom.
    I appreciate it greatly.\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: "Hi \r\n\r\nWhy not make a hybrid site instead. Have some of your elements
    as Flash, maybe the nav, with alternative html nav for users with JavaScript turned
    off. And the main layout and structure in HTML. You could always get Mono Slide
    Show Flash gallery to use for the photography. Then you would be more assured
    of having google etc spider it properly."

  body: "\"Didn\u2019t use flash after all\"\r\n\r\nYay! ;o)\r\n\r\nSite looks nice.
    It's hard to read a lot of the type (it's awfully small and, as it's an image,
    I can't resize it) but, then again, it's the photos that matter so it's probably
    not a huge deal. I like how you ID the photo on the little map on each page. Nice
    touch.\r\n\r\nNice photos, btw!\r\n\r\n"
