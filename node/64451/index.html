To me that screen grab seems to be primarily demonstrating the y-direction antialiasing rather than sub-pixel positioning. However this suggests that IE will be exploiting DWrite's sub-pixel positioning.

		<div class="commentbody">I can confirm that build demonstrated at PDC is doing sub-pixel layout and positioning. If you look at the video, you can see smooth scaling and tracking which would not be possible otherwise.

IE8 used high-resolution layout, but it did not affect text where glyphs always had integral pixel width. Using Dwrite for rendering only in this case would remove jagginess, but would not improve spacing. It requires real sub-pixel text layout to make it work.

Regarding ways to switch rendering modes, this is not determined yet. There are different factors to take into account: technology available on client machine, user preferences, backward compatibility of page layout. At least my opinion is that rendering mode should not be exposed to web designer to control.

<em>"At least my opinion is that rendering mode should not be exposed to web designer to control."</em>

Sergey, I'm fearful of just letting the OS make all the decisions. It hasn't worked out all that perfectly with ClearType. 
How does the Dwrite rendering look at smaller text sizes?
I know it's early on, I hope the team will be keeping interested parties in the loop with more detailed examples.
Thanks.

		<div class="commentbody">It is not the OS making all decisions. Users already tuned ClearType to their eyes, DWrite applied its rasterization algorithms, IE chooses to use different layout parameters depending on font/size/scenario, font designer expressed his intent in hinting. 

What kind of control page author do you think should have? Will this control available for every page be better than user settings applied to whole Web inside your browser?

Unfortunately, I can't give you build of IE using DWrite to play with right now. FireFox is experimenting with DWrite to, although I did not see any, even experimental, build available publicly. You can check out few FireFox screenshots at http://blog.mozilla.com/nattokirai/2009/10/22/better-postscript-cff-font-rendering-with-directwrite/.

I think none. I really wouldn't want a web author to mess with my rasterization settings ;) For users who don't care about customizing their settings, sensible system defaults should be applied (as it is now).

Claus: <em>neither the Windows XP GDI nor the Windows 7 GDI Cleartype is using sub-pixel rendering. Is that normal?</em>

They used an OT-CFF font for the comparison, insofar it is misleading to speak of "ClearType there. (Because OT-CFF could not use ClearType at all prior to DirectWrite.)

This morning I met with my clients in Leiden and among other things showed them comparisons of their new CFF fonts in a variety of rendering environments. They were unanimous that the WPF/DirectWrite rendering was by far the best, so I'm very happy to be able to report back to them now that IE -- and probably Windows Firefox -- will be taking this path.

And, of course, DirectWrite provides full OpenType Layout capabilities.</div>

It's much easier to make stuff up about fairy resolution, write fake sci-fi patents and study people's reactions to flash cards.

...but should know. Maybe it'd be easier to bring the info to the font. WOW, a font media query.

Except for distance which can either be solved by the user moving the user, or by the user scaling the type. 
Except, oh I forgot, no one wants the user to even do font sizing correctly-ish.

Welcome to the "if it ain't as robust as Verdana, make it so" generation of type design.. ;) How long will it last? That's the new lottery. I'm nearly certain that it'll go away as soon as I finish making a dozen families of 5 pt designs. Place your bets!

Would they be rendered useless with the next technology to follow? :-)

My guess is that something new needs to come along that reinterprets outlines for screen use on the fly but is not part of the typeface. The easy answer to envision is higher screen resolution but this comes at a high price. The person who invents a software interpreter that can mimic resolution enhancement and optical sizing will become a wealthy soul.

That's not true at all. All versions of Windows from Windows XP on fully support subpixel rendering of TrueType fonts via native GDI.

Here's the relevant MSDN documentation page for the GDI function <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd183499%28VS.85%29.aspx">CreateFont</a>. Note the <cite>CLEARTYPE_QUALITY</cite> parameter, which was introduced with Windows XP.

If ClearType weren't supported by GDI, almost nothing on your screen would be able to use it.</div>

I think Sergey is talking about sup-pixel "positioning", not sub-pixel "rendering". Although i don't know if sub-pixel positioning can't be done by GDI.

"My rasterization" would be the one I chose, be it thoughtfully or by chance, through my choice of operating system, anti-aliasing settings and maybe more display tuning (e.g. ClearType tuner ...).

I'm comfortable working both on Windows and Mac OS. The different text displays don't bother me, perhaps they are even helpful to remind me inside which system "frame" I am right now. I guess if somebody (e.g. a web author) could break this consistency, it would irritate me.</div>

My question was very simple: what control <em>web developer</em> should have over rasterization parameters. And I said none, because I think web browser should be just transport mechanism, delivering font to OS rednering system.  Whatever information is needed to produce best type on screen should be inculded into font, system parameters and user settings. What this information should include is critical, but completely different, question, independent from whether you use local or embedded fonts.

Yes, I should have been more clear. I mean sub-pixel positioning of glyphs, which is not available in GDI.

But is that what is currently happening?

And of course the OS itself may employ more than one rendering system. I don't mind the multiplicity so much as I mind the lack of documentation.</div>

Yes, it's going to be very difficult to analyze this without an Alpha to play around with.
Two questions:

1) When do you think an Alpha will be available. (If you can share that publicly, here.) Much salivating as you can see.

2) What's the minimum hardware or will any Win 7 capable box be up to the task?

I guess, this is what is at the heart of my request for the quest for a typographic media query in CSS. 

If a web developer could: either have control via query over the OS's rasterization parameters and only in the browser set them to the web publisher's desires, or use a media query to deliver font software sensitive to the apparent preferences of the user, or some combination of each — some web design would flourish. 

Then "all we'd have to deal with" are the multitude of web developer's size and style habits for type, and the fact that the users defaults should never be confused with their true preferences.;)

But I grant that just saying "No", is easier on everyone but the user. 

JH>I don’t mind the multiplicity so much as I mind the lack of documentation.

And even if you have "documentation", well, see MS white paper on CT. We're perfectly free to do anything we want except the right thing. Give it time, you'll mind the multiplicity. Perhaps even enough to someday want variation technology on the client side.

From Sii's link:
>In addition to better performance, this technology shift also increases font quality and readability with sub-pixel positioning:

So, sub-pixel positioning used on text means the the image of the glyph changes from position to position among the text, for "better spacing". Adobe does this in text rendering and it works 'perfectly well" for print preview on screens in zoomable apps. 

sergeym >I mean sub-pixel positioning of glyphs, which is not available in GDI.

Good. The only sub-pixel position I'm interested in, for text type in these resolutions, is under the control of glyph subsitution. 

Jens>The different text displays don’t bother me, perhaps they are even helpful to remind me inside which system “frame” I am right now.

Thanks for the complete answer. Your rasterization, which I'll call "cross-platform/differential-required"  in a very small minority I believe, who can I believe set their preferences to maintain said requirement. So, I believe, your requirement is quite well met today and for the long term future. . . But the counter irritated majority, I believe, is immense including those who don't think their lap should have to change size to be at the right distance from their type, depending on the OS frame.

In any case, it looks to me like DirectWrite continues the long running disunification of type handling on Windows? 

We have one more issue to deal with, and one more query to make a quest for.

I would like to suggest that if Microsoft is going to continue using this confusing jumble of type handling methods it produce a book about designing and hinting for Windows rendering—with designers and not programmers in mind—and publish it through Microsoft press. There’s not much point throwing millions of dollars at text rendering every year if only foundries with large budgets can afford to pay experts to figure out how to make fonts look good on your OS.</div>

@DaveB: DirectWrite is continuing to use WPF rendering. Microsoft can't just take GDI away, but they can encourage people to use something better, which is what they're doing. Of course, they could also improve GDI, which they seem to be less interested in, beyond turning (an earlier version of) ClearType on by default.

@James: I think Microsoft believes that most fonts look better under DirectWrite than under GDI. For OpenType CFF, that's certainly true. I don't think anybody needs to pay experts to make fonts look good under DirectWrite... only if the foundry wants to really maximize the potential rendering quality. But that has always required expert help.

This is a test of different Windows rendering environments that I made to show clients a few days ago. This is a CFF font with PS autohinting using the AFDKO script within FontLab (the final version will be manually hinted, because I'm not happy with all the autohinting results; see top of q for example). This is a typeface that was designed primarily for print use in book publishing, not optimised for screen reading.

<em>"In other words, it is possible for a webpage to contain two fonts that each look better in different rendering settings."</em>

This cracked me up. So chaotic. And no cross-browser, cross-platform answer in sight.
(Sounds like we should get some of them outside standards agitators agitatin' about this. What we have heah, is a failyuh to specificate.)
But that's way premature. What is/are going to be the digital equivalents of paper and ink?
Ah, well. Implementations first. Thanks for a peek at the test shots.

@thomasphinney
<em>if the foundry wants to really maximize the potential rendering quality. But that has always required expert help.</em>
Must we be resigned to the "expert help" part. (I mean, there are ordinary experts, and then there are the "where the frack do I find somebody, anybody who knows how to do this?" kind of expert.)
Or, in your opinion, can the tools be vastly improved with effort and the learning curve significantly lowered?

@sergey and sii,

Based on the video presentation on Channel 9, I'm led to believe that DirectWrite will respect the current behavior of fonts - such as line breaks, word spacing, etc...
True? Not counting the inevitable edge cases - will it be essentially backwards compatible? Dare I say "seamlessly" so?

Interesting. IE8 is using only GDI for text rendering. I have to look at this closer to understand what the differences are between us and FireFox. And I’ll prepare few screenshots showing DWrite in IE9, to show sub-pixel rendering of TrueType and CFF fonts.

I am not ready now to talk about compatibility story in relation to DWrite. The best answer I can give you is that we are aware of this issue and looking at it. At least there is an ability in Dwrite to use glyph metrics compatible with GDI. There are other aspects other than compatibility, e.g. transforms, animations, SVG, that make using subpixel positioning the best option.

The need for expert help to do high end TT hinting isn't going away any time soon. With some investment, TT autohinting could be significantly improved, raising the baseline and reducing the relative advantage of manual high-end hinting (with tools like VTT). The other thing that can be done is to develop auto-hint assistance that feeds into the manual tools, reducing the amount of expert work required to get to the best results. I've heard of multiple folks investigating or doing both approaches, but so far it's all proprietary (in the stricter sense of tools not being available to the public, not just that they're not open source).

Thanks for the info.
<em>With some investment, TT autohinting could be significantly improved, raising the baseline and reducing the relative advantage of manual high-end hinting (with tools like VTT).</em>

No push for open-source. Open, proprietary, whatever. I'm just concerned about "available".
When Adobe tells me that they don't use Fontlab, they use "in-house" tools - well, why are they being kept in-house?
They have every right to do so, of course. Just as MSFT has every right to keep VTT's learning curve high - as long as, I presume, they have access to people who've climbed that curve and can do the work. But that helps them, not me or anybody else.
And it leaves fonts in general looking that much worse.

But I'm glad to hear your opinion that a substantial improvement can be achieved. I'm hoping it's just a matter of time.

I don't understand what you mean by 'keeping VTT's learning curve high'. The learning curve seems to me to be as high as the software demands, and isn't some kind of artificial construct. Also note that VTT represents a significant investment by MS in <em>reducing</em> the difficulty of TT hinting, which previously was done by writing code.</div>

<em>Adobe make their OpenType FDK code available for free</em>
If I'm out to lunch, it certainly won't be the first or last time. The impression I got was that there were tools outside of the FDK. I'm going to ask the person I got the info from if I've got this right. Probably not if you don't think so. Thanks. I'll check.

<em>The learning curve seems to me to be as high as the software demands, and isn’t some kind of artificial construct.</em>
Look, you and Ross can probably navigate around in VTT like it was Windows Notepad. But that's a result of years of working with it. There was a lot of trial and error, I'm sure, that you dimly remember if at all.
I could be out to lunch on this, too, but I suspect you may be too close to it to fairly judge. Once you lose those newbie eyes, that's that. It's really hard to take a fresh look.
When it first appeared I paid special attention to this:
http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/MinionPro_DF3vsDF4embedding/
It's an Adobe Flex app put together by Miguel Sousa in conjuction with a post about text rendering in the new NYTimes Reader.
http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2009/05/times_reader_2.html
This seemed like the basis for one heckuva lot friendlier interface for hinting than I'm seeing in VTT.
Anyway, you don't need to be a forensic scientist to spot the cobwebs on the Microsoft Typography site or to notice that WEFT hasn't been updated since 2003 (with no talk of doing so, either - I guess the ball is in Ascender's court now).
And the stark difference in rendering between Mac and Windows - at least at larger text sizes - is an embarassment, really. I just get the overall impression that the attitude towards font-creation tools and documentation has been that they're good enough and there's no great need to make them appreciably more accessible to the average type designer, let alone the average would-be type designer.
I understand that the market for such tools is limited. This isn't ASP.NET. But I think MSFT gets enough competitive advantage out of its investment in fonts to expect more. I'm sure sii wouldn't complain if his department's budget were to expand.
BTW - I <strong>do</strong> think @font-face will create a great desire for educational materials aimed at those without formal training in design.
Being able to use fonts in web pages will really be a huge change. Hard to predict what's going to happen when you can design a font and get an instant worldwide viewing.
Look at Flickr and photography, YouTube and video, Google Blogger and bullshit.

No, I don't think so. I'm all ears as to any suggestions.

		<div class="commentbody">Rich, I never said that VTT was easy to learn, only that a) the learning curve is commensurate with the complexity of the software and the job that it does and b) it is less steep than learning to hint at the actual instruction level or even in the TypeManTalk language that preceded VTT. Your comments implied that MS was somehow ‘keeping’ VTT difficult to learn, suggesting that it could be easier. I don't think VTT could be much easier than it is, and if you want something easier then use a less complex (and less powerful) tool such as FontLab Studio, which is adequate for a lot of jobs.</div>

I agree that this is absolutely not true. Since Y's highest quality is achievable without it, VTT is essentially for X. X hints being rarely if ever interpreted (to a useful result for text), MS could easily be said to have helped make VTT extremely easy to learn. The Mac doesn't need VTT's capabilities at all, and windows has too many behaviors. So, VTT is no longer an expert's choice for web font development. That leaves the 'high end TT hinting" Thomas refers to, which has, most unfortunately, become uncoupled from web font quality, where they once were 'one'.

Cheers!

There aren't "tools" in the sense of applications or the like. There's a motley collection of Python scripts. Some of those, many of the key ones, are already in the FDK. Basically Adobe is licensing for free all its most valuable code related to making fonts. Besides the code used to actually compile OpenType features and OT-CFF fonts, there's the CompareFamily tool, the Adobe auto-hinter and the obscure-yet-powerful TX conversion tool. Adobe's licensing its crown jewels of font development for free. There's certainly no attempt or desire to keep anything of great consequence proprietary.
