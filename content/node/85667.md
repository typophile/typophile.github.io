  a try.\r\n\r\nI have a bizarre font request.\r\n\r\nPurely for personal fun, I\u2019m
  interested in a sans-serif futhorc (Anglo-Saxon runes) set evolved to resemble the
  Japanese kana (either katakana or hiragana), while still identifiable as futhorc.
  \ Preferably matching the dimensions and weight of simplified Chinese characters
  in another font (I expect creating your own hanzi font would be much too time-consuming).
  \r\n\r\nI keep some private notes in a mixed runic/hanzi script, and a font like
  this would be amazing to see, but perhaps challenging to produce.\r\n\r\nI would
  be willing to make a donation in return for such a font (only a small one, though),
  and I would use it a lot and enjoy it.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like an interesting
  project, give it a try. \r\n"

    you have something you could barter for such a font. Maybe a ring with magical

    for the typographical mind at least. If it is to become a project as well this
    is another question.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s once again about graphically harmonizing
    different scripts, what about we have struggled so far for at least twelve years
    now \u2026\r\nRunes and Kana, sounds a bit strange at the first glance, but it
    isn\u2019t a strange thing at all. I have worked on harmonizing Runes to Latin
    and airport pictos to Greek \u2026 funny yes, but very serious kind of fun ;-)\r\n\r\nWhy
    \u201Csans serif\u201D?\r\n\r\n@ Simon: you and your folks should have been the
    first band to seriously think about harmonizing Runes to Kana and Arabic and Gujarati

  body: "Yeah, it is interesting. Runes weren't designed with paper or brushes in
    mind and were intended for carving, so it would be good to see a modern evolution
    of the script. Chinese characters and runes are my two favourite writing systems
    and, although I can use them together, it doesn't have much aesthetic appeal.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, kana and kanji in Japanese (a mixed system) go together nicely.
    I love looking at Japanese text even though I can't read it. It seems well balanced,
    with the kanji making skim-reading easy and the kana breaking it up, so it doesn't
    look as dense as Chinese text.\r\n\r\nIf I could make my own mixed system (runes
    and simplified hanzi) look that good, it would please me greatly.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the magic ring and crystals, I have none of those to give. :P\r\n\r\nAnd I don't
    have anything against serif fonts, it's just that a nice, clean sans-serif font
    is my priority."

    to another.\r\nTaking the tendencies in the unification of scripts (see [[http://www.typophile.com/node/94050]]
    and [[http://www.typophile.com/node/106261]]) to extreme simplification, this
    resulted [See image DKhanzyr1JPG]. The source influences are at a glance barely
    discernable; the A from the runes (and it looks as though the Anglo-Saxon rune
    Yr is turned into E), the B from Cyrillic, the H from Hebrew, as examples. Instead,
    the overall effect evokes Japanese katakana. Needless to say, it is Latin.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DKhanzyr1JPG_6303.jpg]"

  body: "Imitating hiragana would be challenging due to the profusion of curves inherent
    in that script. Katakana would be a more suitable model.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Chinese
    characters would be the easiest. The predominant text serif style (Song/Ming)
    is quite angular compared to the brushy finish of the kana glyphs that they are
    paired with. Characters like \u6253 even look a bit runish.\r\n\r\nBut from what
    the original poster asked for, it looks like we should imagine futhorc evolved
    to be written in the same traditional manner as kana, that is, with the brush.
    A sort of an alternative-history-type fiction. It could be a fun exercise, and
    for inspiration you could look at examples of Arabic or Indic scripts written
    in the style of Chinese calligraphy."

    by someone working on a Hebrew/Runic fusion typeface, with illustrations of his
    progress.\"\r\n\r\nThat must have been me, but it is posted in the Serif Critique
    section (see the two relevant nodes discernible above in dudefellow 13 Sep 2013
    \u2014 11:13am), not under this discussion. I only saw this kana/runic fusion
    topic after I had made designs for the Hebrew and Runic combination, and was already
    beginning to think that some of its elements appear in Katakana, which is why
    I posted here afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt should not be too difficult to design a Runic
    typeface to blend in to some extent with a chosen Chinese or Japanese system font,
    by using similar stroke thicknesses and brush-like terminals. However, in Runes
    generally horizontal lines are avoided whereas in Chinese characters they are
    prominent. This should cause the two systems of writing used together to be contrasted.
    Nevertheless, there are certain aspects to usual regular modes of Chinese writing
    that favour proximity to runes more than typical Latin scripts, because of the
    absence of complete curves or bowls. The lines in Chinese are mainly straight
    and only curve slightly as they are in runes. Of course, there are other Chinese
    styles that have undulations and other fuller curved lines, but I have never seen
    them being used in modern extended text. I would suggest therefore that the oblique
    lines of the runes be given slight catenary curvature, similar in fact to, but
    not as pronounced as, some of those in the Runic/Hebrew merger shown at [[http://www.typophile.com/node/106261]]."
