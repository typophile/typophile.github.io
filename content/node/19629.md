  have this brand new problem: a big fashion catalogue to be made in three languages,
  part in the italian office, and part in the moscow office. I choosed the \"neosans,
  neotech\" fonts from Monotype, but it does not have [[cyrillic]] fonts and even
  lacks of some accents used in the italian language.\r\n\r\nHave anybody of you just
  had the same problem: can you suggest me some fonts which could fit my needs? Anyway,
  if my english has been understandable (I think I have to practice!) please, can
  you help me with some advice?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\n\r\nBERGMAN\r\n"

  body: "Thanks folks,you've been very kind. And surprisingly quick.\r\nI just checked
    Paratype.com, but Fontshop was a new suggestion.\r\nI think I'll choose a classic
    helvetica (or something like that) but I feel like the Fontshop (or the Myfonts)
    shops have just a limited offer of cyrillic fonts, a sort of \"cyrillic fonts
    for tourists\", cause I've been recently in Russia and you can find there many
    and many fonts on magazines which resembles to western original (for example on
    \"Esquire Russia\", or on \"L'Optimum\" which is much like the american man oriented
    \"Details\") and a rich offer of graphic design. It simply does not communicates
    with us, unless we don't speak russian.\r\nAny clue about any forum like this,
    driven by russian graphics (but hopefully english speaking)? Or any russian graphic
    on the forum? Or elsewhere?\r\n\r\nI think this problem will increase in the near
    future for any western graphic designer. Maybe a non-western section could be
    a fine extention to this beloved website.\r\n\r\nGreetings from Italy\r\n\r\nBERGMAN\r\n\r\n"

    and I'm honored to talk to such experienced type lovers.\r\n\r\n- to Maxim Zhukov:
    Here on viale Gramsci we have many recipes on the way to our oven: we usually
    work on brand and retail projects, but recently we focused on this graphic design
    project in Moscow. My recipes always involve gestalt theories, so you can find
    gestalt almost anywhere, like garlic in italian cuisine! I'd like to put some
    of my garlic in russian recipes too (I hope It works).\r\nWorking with russians
    I could compare cultures and see differences, but mostly I found unexpected human
    and professional qualities, I've seen a country which is growing rapidly and which
    is consciuous of It's value. I often travel for work, and I worked on each side
    of the planet, but with Russia it's been love at first sight.\r\n\r\n- to Alessandro
    Segalini: I don't know what were they thinking when they create the Neo font,
    but it really lacks accents for normal use in italian (you can't write \"\xE8
    la mia citt\xE0\"), in french, and so on.\r\nThanks for your font suggestions,
    but the client likes Neo, so I should work on this font. I found that many publishers
    use their customized version of Neo, and I'm thinking to walk that way. Thank
    you (I suppose we can talk in italian, but It could not be fair for the community
    here on typophile).\r\n\r\n- to Danya: I'm taking Russian language lessons but
    fortunately I can rely on translators when I am in Moscow, cause I'm in a ridicolous
    early stage of learning! I'll contact you. Thank you very much."

  body: "When deciding on a Cyrillic to nicely match a Latin, the one thing I would
    recommend (not least because virtually nobody else will) is to end up with a setup
    where the Cyrillic \"x-height\" is slightly larger than the Latin x-height. This
    is anti-conventional, but to me critical (at least in running text, although not
    in display) since it helps equalize the apparent sizes (because Cyrillic has far
    fewer extenders). One problem though is that you generally can't simply use a
    difference in point sizes (within most any \"canned\" Latin+Cyrillic family) to
    do this, since the color balance will shift. (Yet another reason to wish MM were
    still alive.)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDanya: killer logo.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    face) and it does seem to work, but only when the typeface has a small x-height
    in general. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, the Cyrillic tends to look very \"cappy\" and extender-less
    in comparison with the Latin.\r\n\r\nBut as there are not any typefaces like this
    available, ones that have a large x-height seem to minimize the \"extender gap\"
    between the two scripts, as the extenders don't play such a strong role as they
    do in faces with a small x-height."
