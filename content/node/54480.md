  She asked us to cut out 20 examples of a letter, and 20 items that began with that
  letter. I only scanned half of mine for the blog. I obviously chose the letter 'M',
  and arranged them by color. I started with cool colors on the half you can't see
  and ended with warmer colors.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lookiesee2_4421.jpg]"
