  body: "Yes, it seemed so familiar to me as well, but nothing comes closer than those
    two. Can't find a larger sample.\r\n\r\nWas thinking it might be hand lettered,
    but there are repeating shapes. How often would an artist such as yourself do
    one letter and then duplicate it? Seems counterproductive, but who am I to know
    the habits of a master?"

  body: "Good question Stephen. Did not see your response until now!\r\n\r\nSee..
    I told you I had perception problems. And I posted after you.\r\n\r\n\"Was thinking
    it might be hand lettered, but there are repeating shapes. How often would an
    artist such as yourself do one letter and then duplicate it? Seems counterproductive\"\r\n\r\nOft
    times I will duplicate letters and shapes with alterations to serifs, shape, length
    etc... livens it up a bit since most people want really tight stuff.  You have
    to make small changes to keep it lively. To me it is not counterproductive...
    just a time saver. Make small changes and it appears different. Now if it is for
    editorial I don't duplicate anything. I just keep doing ink roughs until the structure
    is there. Then the touch up begins : (\r\n \r\n\r\nMichael"
