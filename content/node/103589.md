  body: Can be wrong but to me, type on left is not rounded, rather blurred and softened
    by a screen effect. For the rest, it could be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/alternate-gothic|Alternate
    Gothic]] (No 2). You might like too [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0020|Ultramagnetic]],
