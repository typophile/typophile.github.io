body: "Hi all. I've been asked to design a logo for a local bike store and while I
  think the concept I came up with is quite solid, it still feels as if something
  is off. I'm not trying to ask anybody to do the work for me, but it would be nice
  if you could point out any obvious flaws. I'm quite new to the design process and
  after staring at this image for so long, I just don't know anymore. I'd be thankfull
  for any advice. \r\n\r\nThe store sells exclusively KTM bikes, a (middle- to upperclass)
  Austrian bicycle brand. The orange in the logo is the KTM orange. \r\n\r\n(Sorry
  for my English, it isn't my native language) "

    to find a typeface that will work with the concept but feel contemporary. '

  body: "Could you align the letters so that the second O appears to be on the baseline
    implied by the B (as well as staying on the main baseline, of course)? Or would
    that mess up the bicyclist too much? \r\nI agree that other typefaces might be
    worth trying. "

  body: Great concept!  You might customize the type some more and give it some unique
    character.  I would be sure to look at it at a very small size often to make sure
    it works at that size (maybe 1-2cm wide).

    would go for either unique visual shape of some sort  + fonts that will work with
    it\r\n\r\nor custom made characters SVOBODA w/o any cheap tricks of O's being
    wheels and so on.."

  body: "I don't know whether you're aware of it, but word \"svoboda\" means FREEDOM
    in Slovenian (and probably in some other Slavic languages as well) where this
    word most probably comes from if owners are Austrian and their surname is Svoboda
    (which wouldn't be unusual).\r\n\r\nMaybe word FREEDOM will give you some nice
    ideas. It should also go very well with cycling because cycling in its inherent
    nature is very free.\r\n\r\nApart from this fact I think that /O/ glyphs that
    form bike wheels are too heavy, because they look like a motorbike and not bicycle.
    Space between the two /O/ also implies this is a motorbike and not a bicycle.\r\n\r\nAnd
    BTW: This thread should be in Forum/Critique/Logos instead of Forum/Design...
    All logos are discussed there. Maybe some admin can move it."

  body: I think the problem with Gotham in this case is that the style of the logo
    makes one think of old logos like this set in Futura or Helvetica. So you end
    up with a logo that seems to be settling in-between those two, or worse, looks
    like an imitation with a weird version of Helvetica or Futura. Something closer
    to Futura and less American gothic would be better; perhaps Neutraface No. 2 or
    Brandon Grotesque.

    the client tells you to <a =href\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AxwaszFbDw\">Make
    the Logo Big</a>, which they probably will). It would be interesting to see how
    you handle a greyscale version, as well as colour and greyscale dropped out if
    black.\r\n"

  body: "Hello James,\r\n\r\nAs mention earlier by Robert(litera) 'svoboda' means
    freedom. I personally think that the word 'svoboda' itself is very powerful and
    would work on it's own, if treated well typographically. If I were you, I would
    do the symbol separately based on the name of the company. It could be something
    abstract.\r\n\r\nCurrently your logo reminds me more of a company that sells asphalt
    compactors rather then bicycles. Esthetically it's not pleasing as well. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSB"

  body: "Why don't you do the OBO in a lighter or thin weight - cycle tyres are pretty
    thin. It looks more like a motorbike in that weight.\r\n\r\nIn the first style
    with no underline. Keep it simple.\r\n\r\nEdit. Sorry, I didn't pay attention
    to Litera's post."

    bike tire.\r\nIsn't that obvious? \r\ne.g. Futura or Avant Garde."

  body: For me, the space between the crooked B and the baseline is making a much
    brighter area than the rest of the text. As opposed to my eye being drawn to the
    actual logo, it's drawn to that high-contrast dead space area.

    typefaces. I actually really wanted to make some kind of slab-serif font work,
    but it just doesn't. I keep coming back to Gotham, it's driving me insane. Any
    recommendations? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
