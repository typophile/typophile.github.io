body: "Hello all. I hope that someone can help me solve an annoying problem I am having.
  (Especially Si Daniels. Hi Si.)\r\n\r\nWe have a client who has fully licensed one
  of our fonts, and wishes to embed those fonts in internal Microsoft Word documents.
  This is allowed under the terms of our EULA.\r\n\r\nThis client is having a hard
  time getting the fonts to embed in Microsoft Word 2002 and 2003, running on Windows
  XP. The software is probably localised for Norway.\r\n\r\nI have generated the fonts
  in CFF-flavoured and TT-flavoured OpenType, as well as \"traditional\" TrueType
  without any OT features. The embedding was, of course, turned on when generating.\r\n\r\nI
  have generated the fonts every way 'til Sunday, including using FontLab 45M, FontLab
  Studio 5W and 5MBeta, and have tried using TransType Pro 3M starting from every
  conceivable source: VFB, WinTTF, MacTTF, MacPST1, WinPST1...\r\n\r\nIn other words,
  I have jumped through every hoop, to no avail.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that embedding
  in Word is a problem?\r\nIs it possible that the client's font cache is now completely
  full of conflicting fonts?\r\nIs it possible that FontLab and TransType are incorrectly
  saving embedding settings?\r\n\r\nAny help would be massively appreciated. Any off-list
  emails can be sent to chester (at) vllg.com.\r\n\r\nThanks a bundle, phellow typophiles.
  (Can you believe that this is my first ever topic submission?)"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nWord will only embed TTF fonts (OT or TT) not PostScript Type
    1 or OpenType CFF. \r\n\r\nTo check the embedding permissions of your fonts you
    can use... http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeProperty21.mspx \r\n\r\nAlso
    check the font in Font Validator to make sure there are no serios errors as they
    may cause the font to be rejected by the embedding code.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    renumber the font every time you do a version. Not just the suffix part, but the
    begining of the word. Yeah, you end up with some silly names...\r\n"

    say \"Installable embedding allowed\", but my client says that they don't.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a family of 6 un-harmonisable fonts. Is that a problem?\r\n\r\nSi, could I
    possibly send you the fonts to test at your end? I've run Validator, and none
    of the errors appear to be fatal to me.\r\n\r\nSigh,\r\nc"

  body: "I can't say I carried out the most comprehensive programme, but I tested
    font embedding of my employer's new custom TT family and didn't find it reliable
    within Word, although it worked OK in Powerpoint. A bit of digging around on the
    web seemed to indicate a suspicious lack of detailed infomation, particularly
    on how the different levels of font embedding (print, editable, installable) work
    in practice. I'm not sure that it really works as described.\r\n\r\nPlease correct
    me if I am wrong, though.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Chester, I'd be happy to give 'em a test - only have easy access to Office
    XP though. Send them to simonda@ you know where.\r\n\r\nElliot is correct that
    embedding is more reliable in PPT than Word. If the fonts embed fine in PPT but
    not Word then Word would likely be the culprit. \r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "Is there a convincing need to embed them at all? I've never found one for
    Word.\r\n\r\nIf they're for internal distribution as editable docs can't they
    just all have the fonts purchased and installed company wide? Or if for read-only
    distribution, use PDFs.\r\n\r\nRemember that font embedding will increase the
    size of documents and is not controllable on a font by font basis - you can easily
    end up with 1Mb 1 page docs if you embed a few large fonts."
