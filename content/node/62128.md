body: "Hello all.\r\n\r\nI am looking for feedback on my r\xE9sum\xE9. I stuck entirely
  with Warnock Pro, relying on caps and italics to build hierarchy rather than bold
  weights.\r\n\r\nDo you think there is enough contrast to point out the different
  sections? Is there too much info? Do the old style figures fit? Yes or no on italic
  ampersands?\r\n\r\nAny and all feedback is most appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    style figures fit?</em>\r\n\r\nSure. \r\n\r\n<em>Yes or no on italic ampersands?</em>\r\n\r\nI'd
    lean no.\r\n\r\nLabeling the address \"address\" strikes me as redundant.\r\nAre
    all those under \"Employment\" employers, or might any of them be more clearly
    cast as clients?\r\nItalicize the title \"Beacon\""

    upon request. \r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between \"employment\" and \"design
    experience\"?\r\n\r\nDo you need to include \"design study\" and \"design skills\"?
    Your portfolio should demonstrate the latter and the former would make a better
    conversation.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree with Craig's comments."

  body: "Thank you Craig and Tiffany, very helpful comments all around.\r\n\r\nI separated
    the wheat from the chaff and ended up with much more space, as a result, I've
    opted for a different layout. (Resume2 above)\r\n\r\nAs far as the font choice,
    do you think using a serif is too plain/boring/stuffy? I wanted to challenge myself
    to use a serif, particularly because I wanted to attempt a hierarchy without bold
    type, and I feel like a serif will help the r\xE9sum\xE9 stand out. I like Warnock
    because it has a contemporary feel that other serifs I own do not. Can anyone
    speak to this more specifically?\r\n\r\nThanks again."

    GRAPHIC DESIGNER doesn't feel right. \r\nI think the font choice is fine."
