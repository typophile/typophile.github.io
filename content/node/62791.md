  for a client that is using a handwriting inspired typeface. It took a long time
  to select one and we finally settled on a free one from DaFont. I am now slightly
  regretting this decision as the font is not fully built including all of the glyphs,
  especially a hyphen which is really the only thing I need added. If someone has
  the time to explain, what would it take to add a glyph to this font? and is this
  illegal even though the font is free? I know nothing about typeface design or working
  with font editing software, I am mostly versed in Adobe products. Any info would
  be helpful, Thanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The cheapest and easiest way to add a hyphen to the entire font is with TypeTool
    from Fontlab: http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/  It costs $99 and is
    fairly easy to use. In TypeTool simply open the font, add the hyphen, and export
    (only exports truetype fonts though). I'm unsure about the legal concerns. I've
    been wondering the same thing myself.\r\n "

  body: "This depends on the foundry (or designer or whoever who owns the rights of
    the font). Based on my little experience with Dafont, I can tell you that every
    font comes with some kind of text who tells you if it is allowed or not (it is
    called EULA = End User License Agreement). If there is not such text, or if the
    text doesn\u2019t talk about this, you can contact the author via email. Most
    of the times, he/she will allow you to make the change if you explain your situation."

  body: "Whether it's legal or not depends on the terms of the license.  You can always
    e-mail the font designer and ask them.  There's always an outside chance that
    they'll add the hyphen for you.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to TypeTool is FontForge
    (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/), which is free, somewhat tricky to install
    (unless you happen to be on Linux), and not totally intuitive.  The FontForge
    website includes detailed installation instructions and, once you get past that,
    tutorials, which you may not need for the task at hand.  Adding a glyph is mostly
    a matter of drawing Bezier curves; beyond that, you just set the sidebearings
    and generate the font.\r\n\r\nYou may still decide that TypeTool is the right
    tool for you, but you should at least consider the alternatives.  On the one hand,
    the effort required to install FontForge may not be worth it for a single hyphen;
    on the other hand, $99 is a lot to pay for a hyphen.\r\n\r\nI guess a third option
    is to pay for a font that already contains the characters you need...\r\n\r\nIf
    you do decide to go with FontForge and happen to run into problems, send me a
    message and I'll do my best to help.  I'm no expert, but I think I can handle
    adding a hyphen."

  body: "With my somewhat limited experience, I've to say that using fonts from Dafont
    can get very messy down the road. It's not the first time I see this problem happen
    with accents, punctuation or even numbers. In one occasion, one of my partners
    used a font from Dafont and after finishing the job he was going to export a PDF
    (from InDesing). The font didn't allow embedding so he had to change the font,
    the text reflowed and he had to redo all of the text fitting. The funny part is
    that this typography was advertised as \"free\".  Sometimes paying for a good
    font or downloading one free but better will pay itself several times when you
    start to work.\r\n\r\nIf you tell us what font you're using I might be able to
    help you further. Some of the fonts in that page are public domain so editing
    permission is not needed.\r\n\r\nRegards."

    I am going to switch to a better quality font, deep down I knew this needed to
    happen, but I was just resisting and hoping for a quicker fix haha. Thanks again. '

    for bringing me down to earth on the DaFont thing, you were right. If any of you
    have the time I could use some help on another handwriting font I am trying to
    find. I started a new thread: http://typophile.com/node/62825\r\n\r\nThanks everyone. "
