  body: "Hi Neven,\r\n\r\nI really like your idea as well as the execution. I prefer
    the second version because it shows more of the dirty background texture and it
    has a better colour balance. Even so, I'm not sure about the horizontal blue stripe.
    It seems to me that it doesn't do any work in terms of symbolism and a second
    colour (the first being the author's name if we take the rest as different degrees
    of grayscale) is just too much.\r\nAlso, if you have access to a printer you should
    see how they look covering an actual book. At least, this usually helps me a lot.\r\n\r\nKeep
    up the good work,\r\n\xE1"

  body: "Thanks for your comment, akos! I also prefer the second one. :)\r\n\r\nI
    would leave the blue line, though, because it symbolizes the sea - here's a quote
    from wikipedia revealing some of the plot:\r\n\"Realizing that they will not survive
    another winter in their unspecified original location, the father leads the boy
    south, through a desolate American landscape along a vacant highway, towards the
    sea, sustained only by the vague hope of finding warmth and more \"good people\"
    like them\""

  body: I'm familiar with the story, but as far as I remember, the sea turns out to
    be far from the blue salvation they hope/expect it to be. Anyhow, I just think
    a less varied colour palette would reflect the bleak tone of the book more adequately.
    I might be completely wrong though.
