    a good reason. One: I only get paid 6 an hour. Two: Our sign company is only three
    weeks old, and can&#39;t really throw money around. We don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll
    ever even use the font again &#40;probably not&#41;, so I can&#39;t justify begging
    my boss to fork over 20 here and 12 there every time we need a font for a one-time
    use. <BR> <BR>Right now I don&#39;t care what &#42;my&#42; time is worth, I just
    want to get the job done. So please don&#39;t think less of me, I&#39;m trying
    to be economical.'

    that there were two g&#39;s available in that weight, including the one in the

    target="_blank">&#39;Quid&#39;</a> has this same &#39;g&#39;. It&#39;s quite possible
    this is what they used, since it&#39;s the only bold digital version I know like
    this.

  body: 'Hi Conna, <BR> <BR>I actually don&#39;t think you are a cheapskate or think
    less of you. I also am not intending to make a big deal out of nothing, but I
    have found myself in the same quandry when running my small business.  <BR> <BR>In
    your reply you suggest the cost of the fonts should be footed by: <BR>1: You &#40;One:
    I only get paid 6 an hour&#41; <BR>or <BR>2: Your Fledgling Company &#40;Two:
    Our sign company is only three weeks old, and can&#39;t really throw money around/I
    can&#39;t justify begging my boss to fork over 20 here and 12 there&#41; <BR>
    <BR>I have to remind myself that the person who should pay for the font license
    is my client. Certainly a painter passes on the cost of their paint. My fear is
    always that I will lose business because my estimates will go up, but this hasn&#39;t
    been the case. <BR> <BR>My two cents, which in this case is a moot point since
    Mike has miraculously produced a two cent verson with the correct g. <BR> <BR>Cheers,
    <BR>Randy'

  body: 'Randy: <BR> <BR>Well, ordinarily we would charge the client for the font,
    but in this case the client is us. The signmaking company is one of two businesses
    owned by my boss, the other being an outfitter that sells small camper-trailers
    and personal watercraft like the CraigCat. Thus our need for the font so we can
    put the logo up on our sign out front. <BR> <BR>But, point is now doubly moot,
    since the boss-man has decided the font&#39;s worth it, because we&#39;ll be doing
    boat letter decals in that font to match.'
