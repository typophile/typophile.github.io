body: "<em>CJKV Information Processing</em> Second Edition goes to press on the 10th.
  Given that I am also typesetting it, using Adobe InDesign CS3-J, it is in my hands
  right up until then. The current page count is 900 pages. That includes 34 pages
  of front matter and 26 pages of index. I submitted the book to O'Reilly for QC2
  (Quality Check 2) this morning. I spent the four-day Thanksgiving Day break entering
  QC1 edits and applying page-breaking to the book. It is in very good shape.\r\n\r\nThe
  proverbial \"light at the end of the tunnel\" is getting pretty darn bright now.

    search for \"CJKV\" there, and it will be the first thing that pops up. O'Reilly
