  somewhat similar to some of the 'celtic/gaelic' fonts, but i couldn't find a match.\r\n\r\nThe
  V is pretty rare.  Would you call this a serifed or not serifed font?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/new-vae_5343.png]"

    MacHumaine. I am not linking to it, because I think it seems dubious (\"unknown\"
    designer). Perhaps that name will suggest an legitimate font with a similar name?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Mike, you are right about all letters but the V, and the stretching. MacHumane's
    V differs. According to <a href=\"http://www.fontspace.com/category/Zapf+Chancery+Black?text=Vaevictus.net&fontsize=122&foreground=000000&background=FFFFFF\"><strong>this
    link</strong></a>, MacHumaine is from  Bill Horton and a very similar font from
    Dan Smith, DS Mysticora, has the appropriate V, once stretched:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vaevictus_5423.jpg]\r\n"
