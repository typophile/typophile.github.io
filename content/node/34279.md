body: "I'm working on an annual report currently and was wondering if there is any
  spacing recommended for S&P/TSX. It all looks like a big chunk to me. What would
  you recommend? Keep it without spaces? Thin spaces before and after the ampersand
  or the slash?\r\n\r\nAlso, in english, is it correct to use superscript in dates?
  As March 1st, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!\r\nEmilie"

    an affectation by many.\r\nIf you do use superscript, make sure the font has proper
    superscript characters, and doesn't just shrink the font, in faux style."

  body: "Nick's suggestion of using small caps is a good idea. But only if you are
    using small caps consistently throughout the report. I'm not a big fan of acronyms
    set in full caps in body copy. But it happens a lot. Especially in annual reports.\r\n\r\nIf
    I was setting the type, I would add thin spaces before and after the slash but
    not the ampersand. Though this largely depends on the typeface.\r\n\r\nAlso, I
    second Nick's caution about faux small caps and superscript.\r\n\r\n"

      set all the acronyms in small caps. There really are a lot. \r\n\r\nI'm using
      Minion Pro on this design so I should have all the real characters available
      for use."
