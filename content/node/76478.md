  I'm looking for.  However, I'm having a problem figuring out what font is used in
  this logo.  We are a Web Application and Site company and have recently entered
  the Printing industry.  We have a client that wants to print up some shirts but
  the only image they have is jpg and they want it modified.  I figured out the SCORE
  portion pretty quickly but am drawing blanks on the BOARD PIZZA CO. portion.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas what font is used there?"
