body: "I was looking through the 1934 Standard Line catalogue, when I learned some
  interesting facts about Caslon 471.\r\n\r\n- Instead of being set on the Art Line,
  like Cloister Lightface, it was set on the Original Line. That may mean that it
  is not part of the American Line system, and isn't an even amount of half points
  away in baseline from Standard Line, Art Line, and whatever ATF's Title Line was
  called.\r\n\r\n- It is supposed to be <em>identical</em> to Caslon 540, except for
  the latter having shorter descenders. This, I presume, excludes some pantographic
  width adjustments to make the widths even multiples of 1/4 point given the letters
  now being larger to fit the slug with the lower baseline."
