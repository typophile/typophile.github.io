  body: "You're welcome. BTW, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\">WhatTheFont</a>
    gets pretty close for this.\r\nThe <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/baskerville-be/\">BE
    version</a> is quite similar too, but the BQ has the inktraps, and looking at
    your \"M\" that's probably a closer match. There might be other versions, but
    I think the general direction is right. :)"

    different. What's the reason for two abbreviations? Was one of them the Adobe/Berthold
    version?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
