    title="Akzidenz-Grotesk Extended Medium">Akzidenz-Grotesk Extended Medium</a>,
    but with only those characters to go by, it could be something else too.

  body: Hum. If we assume the copy is the same font as the main title, it wouldn't
    be Akzidenz-Grotesk or Gill Sans Bold because of the 'G' in 'THING,' but if we
    just look at the title, both seem pretty close.

    the M seems wrong to me"

    a narrow ITC Blair or a wide Interstate."

    at the other suggestions now!

  body: "Well, the Akzidenz Grotesk I linked has a similar feel for the title at least,
    but you're right, it isn't what we're looking for (I'm kinda new to this, but
    am trying!).\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/engravers-gothic/bold/\"
    title=\"Engravers Gothic\">Engravers Gothic</a> has a lot of the right characters,
    but the C & G are a little different, though it is a bit hard to make out at the
    resolution.\r\n\r\nActually, on closer review, I think Engravers Gothic is the
    one. In \"ROCKWELL,\" you can see the ends of the C don't come to the horizontal
    and the G is too small to see if it comes to a point or not."

    Blair]]. The M 'crotch' is in the right place. Few sans M's are like this. Also
    has right R and G. Matching all three narrows the choice a lot.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    (small caps) glyphs.

  body: Yeah the 2 is weird but can be explained by Edward's illustration which says
    950,000 miles, not 250,000...I guess whoever amended the mistake didn't have the
    font (ITC Blair looks pretty good - the bold version but using the lower case/small
    caps).
