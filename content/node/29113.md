body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI am a graphic design student, and am always distracted by everything
  typographic around me. There is a store in Boston called Dress, which I spotted
  while walking one day. I was drawn to the store, as their sign is pure type. it
  is understated, and very elegent I feel. I went inside to ask for a business card,
  which really impressed me as well. The logo of the store stumped me though. It appears
  to me as if the designer has modifed the typeface, but I just wanted to be sure.
  I just thought it may interesting to share. Does anyone have any ideas? I was playing
  around with different typefaces in Illustrator, and it almost seems as if they modified
  Filosofia to me. The bowl of the d, counterform of the e, and the space under the
  ear of the r seem to be closest to Filosofia (for what i have for typefaces).\r\n\r\nJustin"

  body: "It  doesn't look like Filosofia to me, although the 'd' and 'r' seen to be
    very similar. I think the 'e' and especially the 's' are different, though. I'm
    afraid those letters are not very distinctive -- even some of the Century fonts
    seems pretty close, and match much better on the 's' -- so I think it will be
    hard to ID this with only these letters.\r\n\r\nDo they use the same typeface
    in other ways, where we could see more letters from the alphabet?\r\n\r\n - Mike
