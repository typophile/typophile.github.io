body: "hello,\r\ni apologize for my bad english\r\ni speak spanish\r\nand i live -legally-
  in germany\r\n\r\ni am working at a software project for small children\r\nbetween
  3 and 6 years old\r\ni can not not yet show you samples of this,\r\nbut i wil try
  to describe it\r\n\r\nbecause i have enough of the soft aqarell romantic stodge\r\nbecause
  i think that children are not treated seriously\r\nbecause most of the software
  is made without  asking them\r\n\r\ni and my team are working since eight months
  at \"kolis\"(not the real name)\r\ni, and my team, ben 3, pablo 4, luis 5 and boris
  5 1/2 years old\r\nare working with the principle of schlichheit (simplicity) and
  straightness\r\nwe are thinking in terms of reducing everything to the max\r\nand
  we take a lot of care of balance and proportion, color and composition\r\n\r\nthe
  elements -charaktere-simbols-numbers-sound- are austere, thrifty inserted\r\nthere
  is a lot of blank space\r\nsound is minimal \r\n\r\nand it works! without stress
  without scores, this is a software to play,\r\nto learn to use the computer and
  to learn some basics like characters, numbers, colors, etc\r\n\r\nand i use akzidenz
  grotesk \r\n\r\ni know it works, (children have no problems recognizing it)\r\ni
  think this is a beautiful font (i am jus an illustrator)\r\ni think it has some
  of this simplicity and straight (precise) character wich i want\r\n\r\ni am not
  definitively sure about this choice, \r\n\r\ni ask you with a respectfully bow\r\n\r\nwhat
  do you think?\r\n(about the font choice?)\r\n\r\nbest regards\r\n\r\nsupay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    in the bold weight at small size.\r\nLook at the lower case \"e\", and how narrow
    the gap is into the bottom counter (inside space).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<em>...soft
    aqarell romantic stodge..</em>\r\n\r\nno need to apologize for such a beautiful
    use of English!"
