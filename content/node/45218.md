  the arrangement of the type on the cover, - so much so that I took a photo of it
  with my phone.\r\n\r\nI'm now curious as to what the typeface may be or preferably
  if there is anything similar? \r\n\r\nIt could be a customized typeface?\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions are appreciated. "

    like it was taken from an italicized \u201Ci\u201D and rotated to fit in the graphic.\r\n\r\nhttp://vllg.com/Lux/LuxSans/mudTyper+Weights/\r\n\r\nMikey

  body: "Thank you both for replying, I'm grateful. :) - Lux Sans is very close but
    after comparing Plume in Bold, it certainly seems identical. That's fantastic,
    really, thanks again.\r\n\r\nOh. and I'm going to be extra cheeky and post another
    request (likely to be my last for a while)...\r\n"
