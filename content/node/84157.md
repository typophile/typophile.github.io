body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3967.jpg]\r\n\r\nHaving difficulty
  identifying this font. I thought I had this one or seen one very similar, but I
  guess not. None of the other font-finders seem to work well at identifying it either.
  \r\n\r\nI have a feeling that the large P, I, and A are different fonts, if so,
  then they do not  matter. \r\n\r\nThe serif at the bottom of the letter V and N
  are what really caught my eye and is the font I am looking for.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your help in advance! :)\r\n\r\n~Jedi"

  body: "Hummm...yeah, I have been having a difficult time finding this font. I guess
    it could have been hand-lettered. However it was scanned from a business card
    (that could be the reason for the slight differences in the Es), though not by
    me, but I did crop and darken the pic above so it could actually be seen.\r\n\r\n*shrug*
    I dunno. I have found elements of the characteristics from other fonts that match
    up, but none where they are all together. Perhaps it could be pieced together
    from different fonts? Though, the only characteristics I still cannot manage to
    find are those decorative notches/serifs of the V & Ns down point.\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot for your help. I will continue to look and if I find it I will let you all
    know. :)\r\n\r\n~Jedi"

    a different font altogether."

  body: "Yeah, I have seen other versions of the companies name. They are apparently
    a bit inconsistent with how it is presented for the most part. It is different
    on their website http://www.protectiveins.com/ as well.\r\n\r\nThough like I said,
    the image I provided was scanned from a business card and they were probably unable
    to locate what the font was used when making other things like signs and such
    (or just did not really care much).\r\n\r\nIn either case, I like how this font
    looks over all, but more specifically how the V and N look in it. Hopefully one
    day I will find it.\r\n\r\nThanks! :)"
