  body: I have not been able to find this so far, but it's intriguing. The book is
    from the end of 70's if I'm not mistaken so maybe the typeface has never been
    digitized, but it would be nice to see it ID'd!

  body: Indeed, it certainly has some resemblances with Engravers. I must say I quiet
    like this C and R. It would be really nice see this one ID'd.
