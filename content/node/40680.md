  was a How-To on creating proper obliques. I can't seem to find it anymore, however.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have a link to this? There were a couple details in it I'd like to review.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    see Briem's pages on italics. Start here:\r\nhttp://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.31.italic.htm\r\n\r\nand
    note also the three sub-links in this section. His bit on curves is great.\r\n\r\nI've
    already started writing up some of my own observations on italics and obliques,
    stemming from my work on Hypatia Sans italics. Mostly aimed at the practical issues
    of making modified obliques or italics from an upright face. Might be helpful
    to somebody out there, I hope.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: This one's for Thomas Phinney, and I'm sure it's been asked a million times
    before. I'm just too ignorant to know where to look for the answer. Is Hypatia
    Sans italics available yet? I'm currently using the font family offered with CS3
    and it rocks. Let me know when and where I can get my hands on the italics. Thanks
