body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm designing a handwriten font wich contain many alternate
  sets of characters and I programmed a calt feature to randomize  it. The feature
  contains a lot of lines mixing and conditioning the substition of each character.
  I thing the sintaxis is fine and the replacement works fine too, but when I increase
  the number of characters in each of the classes used in the code the output panel
  shows the following warning:\r\n\r\n[FATAL] <WildPenOT> GSUB feature '\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF'
  causes overflow of offset to a subtable (0x1140a)\r\n\r\n(I don't know why the name
  of the feature is swhown without the correct name).\r\nI guess it means the code
  becomes too heavy but searching and reading a lot of posts of similar bugs I concluded
  that the responsible of this issue was the program. So I decided to try compiling
  the font in an older version (FL 5.0) and there aren't any problem and the compiled
  font works fine.\r\nPlease tell me what can I do to improve my version of FL to
  avoid this issue. Any comment will be appreciated."

  body: "I think you can fix this by defining several lookup tables in the calt feature
    and specifying the useExtension keyword in each of the lookups.\r\nSomething like
    this:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfeature calt { # Alternates\r\n  lookup calt_1 useExtension
    {\r\n\t  ...\r\n  } calt_1;\r\n  lookup calt_2 useExtension {\r\n\t  ...\r\n  }
    calt_2;\r\n  lookup calt_3 useExtension {\r\n\t  ...\r\n  } calt_3;\r\n} calt;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nJohnych"
