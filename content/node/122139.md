  about new tool: https://github.com/twardoch/ttfdiet\r\n\"ttfdiet (TTF DIacritics
  Encoding Tool) applies a \u201Cdiet\u201D to a .ttf font: it modernizes the way
  in which glyphs for precomposed Unicode characters are stored in a TrueType-flavored
  OpenType font, and reduces the font's file size.\" [from README.md]\r\n\r\nI installed
  Behdad Esfahbod's FontTools https://github.com/behdad/fonttools/archive/master.zip
  and wrote diet.bat file:\r\n\r\n<code>python c:\\ttfdiet.py %1 \r\npause <code\\>\r\n\r\n-
  be sure Python (2.6 or higher) is installed and added to the PATH\r\n- \"c:\\ttfdiet.py\"
  it is where file ttfdiet.py is stored\r\n- there is no output font file name, so
  ttfdiet will create ttf file, with .diet added, in the path where input font file
  is stored\r\n- \"pause\" let me to see what will happen\r\n\r\nIt works perfectly.
  Fonts were tested in BabelPad and FireFox 32.0.3 (winXP sp3). See FireFox:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_5578.jpg]\r\nI
  don't care the file is smaller, important is that errors are clearly visible (I
  marked some with red circles). I belive font will be better when \"diet-proof\"
  or \"diet-ready\".\r\n\r\n"
