  for Opentype features like true small caps and ligatures?\r\n\r\nI have a friend
  who is trying to layout their poems but doesn't have InDesign or Quark.  Both Word
  and sWriter have fake small caps and those just won't do!\r\n\r\nThanks for yr help."

    chart if you scroll down. As you can see, Adobe CS and Quark are pretty much it,
    at least for advanced features. If your friend wanted to use Word, they could
    cheat by going to insert>character, and finding each SC or whatever glyph they
    wanted, and inserting them one by one. Unless their poetry is Icelandic saga length,
    this might be a usable workaround."

    it's easier to access small caps that way than via the OpenType menus in Quark
    and InDesign, so your friend with Word should be just fine."

    we could lobby their development community to make full support a priority. Might
    as well poke at the Scribus, GIMP, and Inkscape folks as well.

    open source world except the already mentioned XeTex:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType#Advanced_typography\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    Expression Design supposedly supports it. Not open source, but I've been looking
    for a replacement for Freehand, and I might have to (reluctantly) give that MS
    product a try. \r\n\r\nScribus is an open source page layout app like Xpress and
    InDesign. There's a bit of info on this page:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.scribus.net/index.php?lang=en&sm=crossplatform&page=machints1\r\n\r\nspecifically:
    \r\n\r\n\"In addition, Scribus supports OpenType Fonts, but not in the DFONT format
    that MacOSX uses. You can use fondu, a tool to convert fonts with resource forks,
    into a format which can be understood by X11. You are recommended to convert OpenType
    fonts into TrueType/ OpenType fonts, to preserve all the glyphs. (Type 1 fonts
    are limited to 256 gylphs per font.)\"\r\n\r\nI'm not knowledgeable enough on
    OpenType to translate that. "

  body: "SuperUltraFabulous: depends what you mean by GUI. If you mean a WYSIWYG editor,
    no, there isn't, by LyX comes close (I don't know whether it likes XeTeX though).
    If you are happy to type markup, but want TeX compilation and preview integrated
    into your editor, then you should take a look at TeXnicCenter, Texmaker and MiKTeX.
    I cannot recommend any of these, since I've never used any of them, but they might
    be what you're after.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to do TeX the old-fashioned way, myself:
    vim and the commandline."

    most of the TeX-oriented IDEs like TeXnicCenter and TeXmaker won't currently work

    allows UTF8 saving, and works perfectly fine with XeTeX (it's what I use it for),
    so I'd say use TexMaker in combination with XeTeX's ability to use any system
    font you have available. Just make sure to change the quick build command to using
    \"xelatex\" instead of \"latex\", and to set default editor font encoding to \"utf8\"
    and you're pretty much good to go."
