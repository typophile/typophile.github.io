  on intertitles in silent films. i know that for the most part they were there for
  communication purposes, but does anyone know of any 20s films that used intertitles/type
  in a more expressive manner? i was thinking along the lines of un chien andalou...though
  i'm not sure how expressive that really is.\r\n\r\nalso if anyone can think of any
  good modern examples...i know kubrick liked his intertitles to be futura extra bold.\r\n\r\nanyway,
  if theres any experts...speak up!\r\n\r\nps sorry to make a \"HELP ME WITH MY HOMEWORK\"
  type topic. i hate those."

    silent movies have pretty typical hand lettering ranging from restrained to ornate

      to the 1940 or 1978 versions), for something expressive, ((and www.silentera.com
      specializes (indirectly) in film fonts, if you're reeeally interested;))). The
      type think I am working on, as encapsulated in the presentation I gave at ATypI
      in Rome, is ongoing and has expanded, but the font based on the font in this
      film is still part of it. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/MeyerTwo is
      based on this era as well. . . \r\n\r\nI think each studio had its own staff
      or hired from the foundries, to create fonts on film for film. I wish someone
      would catalog them all but... \r\n\r\nThere's also this guy named Joe Clark(.org),
      but you might need some help figuring out what's goin' on there, or at least
      I did. He's primarily interested in Captioning fonts, which he seems to think
      are \"totally different\" from intertitles, or to come to my extreme, screen
      fonts. I think, they are all the same because of their intent, which is to bring
      the dialog from the screen to the user via type. . . \r\n"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm not a type expert, but Stewf sent me this thread for my film
    expertise.\r\n\r\nThe most expressionistic intertitles are probably found in,
    appropriately, German Expressionism. This can be seen in Hollywood productions
    like \"Sunrise,\" by the movement's greatest director, F.W. Murnau. In \"Sunrise,\"
    the intertitles are in many instances animated, alternating size or at one point
    taking on the form of water. (Guy Maddin, mentioned and linked above, obviously
    took inspiration from these styles in his intertitles.) Among silent film scholars,
    these intertitles are a point of contention with purists, who prefer them stationary,
    and there is debate over whether or not Murnau was actually involved in those
    titles since he generally made an effort to use little to no intertitles in films
    like \"The Last Laugh.\"\r\n\r\nA restoration of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\"
    from a few years ago tried to make titles in the same distorted type (or at least
    the spirit of it) as the German original. I don't know if you can get your hands
    on the original German, as I've only seen English versions, but you might be able
    to get the feel for it if you find the quality transfer. Many films don't have
    their original intertitles because their only surviving copies were found in other
    countries, where they were re-shot in a different language, but those are generally
    easy to detect, especially for typophiles.\r\n\r\nAlso, due to problems with copyrighting
    early films, a monogram was often used in the intertitles (and in some films,
    especially Biograph productions, built into the sets). This tradition continued
    after some of the legal issues were resolved."

    directly related to \"bringing the dialog from the screen to the user via type\"*,
    but Gerald Lange once told me that some TV shows -notably The Twilight Zone- used
    actual metal type for their titles:  they'd directly photograph the type in a
    special way (apparently by sticking some sort of film to the face) to get \"lettering\"
    out of it.\r\n\r\n* More related to the technical dimension of the issue (that
    I suspect Joe is concentrating on - maybe indeed too much though).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
