  Photomontage by Heartfield, 1932.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite design movements is
  the Modern Art movement. I especially love the posters of John Heartfield. His works
  are strong political statements, but what I like best about them is how beautifully
  executed each of them are. I think this poster is declaring a strong, still relevant
  statement about people blindly following mass media. But even if the political statement
  is removed, I think the poster is still beautiful. \r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image_6433.php.jpg]\r\nKassama
  Corn Flour by Beggarstaffs, 1894.\r\n\r\nComing from an advertising background,
  I like the Pictorial Modernism movement, as it was here that the first ads were
  created. I especially like the designs of Beggarstaffs. Their use of clean layouts
  and eye-catching colors resulted in ads that are still as fresh today as they were
  a century ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/carson_1_4675.jpg]\r\n\r\nOf
  course, I am also mad for Digital Revolution design. I particularly like David Carson's
  innovation in design. I think his design is truly ground-breaking. I like to look
  at his work for inspiration because he does things with type I've never dreamed
  of.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
