body: "Im curious to know what everyones process is for selecting and finding a font
  for a particular project.\r\n\r\nDo you use a particular font management tool or
  browse font foundries, a website? I ask because when I feel a project needs a particular
  style of font, something unique, and something doesn't come to mind straight away,
  I tend to fall back on Font Explorer X first, which is time consuming, and I cant
  seem to view paragraphs of text on that (if someone knows if this is possible please
  let me know), I then bring fonts in InDesign and reference with a possible other
  fonts and combinations. When one doesnt come to mind early on, and theres alot of
  fonts to get through, it can be a daunting process.\r\n\r\nAn example lets say might
  be the recent Pentagram design for Garden Museum (https://fontsinuse.com/uses/19122/garden-museum),
  two beautifully matched fonts, I think, that you probably wouldn't use day to day
  (Amira and Humanist 970), so finding them would be all the more difficult unless
  of course you've had them on standby. \r\n\r\nId just be curious to know the process
  some of you have?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    (if the're non consecutive hold 'command' key as you select) then hit command
    I (that's i for info), click on the 'detailed preview' pane and double click anywhere
    inside that window. there you will see dummy text choices one of which is 'A horse's
    tale' by Mark Twain. But you can also 'roll your own' by choosing custom and cutting
    and pasting from whatever source you wish.\r\nHTH\r\nLes"

  body: Thanks Les, I meant in the actual viewer itself, to be able to select a couple
    of fonts and select as paragraph so you can scroll through paragraphs of each.
    Currently it shows ones long sentence and when a few fonts are selected theyre
    so cramped together that I find it quite difficult to focus properly on one alone.

  body: 'Lots of questions come in my mind when I''ve to choose a typeface. I would
    say this: What kind of projetc? Long reading or short folder? Poster or book?
    Is there all the accented letters in the font? Is there a lot of weights from
    light to Ultra for instance? What kind of readers will have? After, I choose in
    my short list the one who reach the most my target.'

    If I see text set in Palatino, I know they lack imagination (use Aldus Roman!).
    I am reading a book set in Goudy Old Style; it looks too thin and weak. \r\n\r\nI
    use Aldus Roman, Palatino 1950 (not current styles), Trajanus, Lydian, and occasionally
    Optima. Sabon isn't bad. I would never set text in sans-serif of any description."
