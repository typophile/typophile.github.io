  body: "Hi Derek,\r\n\r\nyou already have given a perfect description yourself: It\u2019s
    a distressed sans, probably based on Arial Black. If you take a close look at
    the duplicate characters (\u2018E\u2019, \u2018A\u2019, \u2018N\u2019, \u2018B\u2019,
    \u2018S\u2019), you\u2019ll see that they\u2019re not identical. Thus, it\u2019s
    likely not a font.\r\n\r\nF"

  body: The description is mine, Florian. It originally said something like "Please
    help me identify this font". :^D ;^)
