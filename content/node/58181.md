  When I look at these designs it makes me curious as to where the designer obtained
  their resources:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/7_nj-fright_6735.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ALESANANEONBLOOD_5276.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lifeofparty_3463.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/njantihorror_5141.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/suicide_swarm_5693.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bloodshotmock_4482.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ldhorror_5223.jpg]"

  body: "And Nathan, you may also be interested in an article Art Chantry wrote about
    Harry Chester (yes, that was his real name), who was responsible for a lot of
    horror lettering of the 1950s... The article was published in <a href=\"http://www.commarts.com/features\">the
    January/February 2009 issue of Communication Arts</a> (you can read it online
    if you have a subscription).\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/harry_chester_3872.png]"

  body: Thanks for the info Richard. I'm actually more interested in finding horror
    imagery rather than typography. But I will check the article out anyway.
