body: "Dear Members and friends!\r\nDuring the last year I'm writing a research on
  Hebrew type faces designed by the most prominent designer - Zvi Narkiss.\r\nThe
  research will contain spectacular visual materials which are part of the impressive
  archive Narkiss created. This archive is also the basis of my research.\r\nThis
  project is extreamly important and undoubtedly significant to students of typography,
  lecturers and design professionals. Also to the general public viewing the Hebrew
  language and typography manifested so beautifully in Hebrew type faces developed
  in course of the 20th century and today.\r\nOnce it's finalized, the research which
  will be published as book in Hebrew and in English. It  will contain a broad range
  of images, shown for the first time, particularly interesting thanks to it's relevance
  in historical, cultural, social, technological and design contexts .\r\n\r\nA month
  and a half ago I uploaded to \"Headsart\" (Mass funding site) the research i'm writing,
  in order to raise the budget for launching and publishing the project.\r\n\r\nAttached
  is a link to the project:\r\nhttp://www.headstart.co.il/project.aspx?id=8657\r\n\r\nIf
