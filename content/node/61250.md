  font for some time to use in a project but I have come up empty. It is used in \"Above\"
  magazine (Italian design magazine). I attached an image but have plenty of examples
  so let me know if you need to see a specific letter or more examples. Thanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Script2_4549.jpg]"

  body: This could very well be custom. It's a bit messy, the joins are splotchy and
    curves clunky. If you like this style I would go for <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_speak_ot/">FF
    Speak</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/typonine/tempera_rose_pro/">Tempera
    Rose</a>, or <a href="http://www.vllg.com/Incubator/Router/mudTyper+Weights/">Router</a>.

  body: "Great suggestions! Thanks.  Yah I figured it was probably custom but hoped
    it was a slightly modified version of something else.  It appears everywhere in
    the magazine and in a slab-serif and sans version.  \r\n\r\nSome of the clunky
    curves appear to be intentional, (the \"k\" in \"make\") to add an odd form of
    emphasis, I was actually going to remove those as they are a distraction. Router
    is perfect though for what I need.  Thanks Again!"

    Font Design. Her page offers randomized samples of her work, but I did not see
    the font from ABOVE. Her site has an e-mail link to reach her if someone really
    wants to know the name, and whether it is proprietary.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
