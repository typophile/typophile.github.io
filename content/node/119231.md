  body: "I agree with Kevin that LuMarc Bold is close, but despite the small scale
    of the image [can we get a larger one?] there seem to be differences. Here is
    Lu Marc Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LuMarcBoldInUseSM_5883.jpg]\r\nThe
    wordmark  has significant differences from Peignot Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/PeignotBoldInUseSM_5071.jpg]\r\nSo
    was the wordmark an edited version of a font, or something we have not found yet?\r\nDon"

    Treacy Faces, they were among the best from the first wave of digital fonts. They
    show a lot of effort to make the contours precise and effective and hold up very
    well in competition with more recent fonts.\r\nDon"
