  body: I see people coming from this link and I see no submissions from any of non-russian
    designers. Tell me frankly - is the whole thing stupid, uninteresting or...? Why?
    Plain laziness in action?.... <BR>Just wondering.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> never met to hurt your feelings. and I didn&#39;t mean
    any particular reader of this forum. it&#39;s just that, as I&#39;ve said, people
    click - but that&#39;s it. in other places they would say &#34;nice, i am in&#34;
    and then again - nil. so, I was wondering why.
