  http://msg.cordonmedia.com/msg.php\r\n\r\nIt resembles New Republic but the characters
  are wider & there is a noticeable difference between the \"S\"\r\nand New Republic's
  \"S\".  This also seems to be a \"light\" type version & I do believe New Republic
  does not\r\nhave a light version.\r\n\r\nOnce the site load's select the center
  option \"THE SUITE EXPERIENCE\" once all of the animation finishes you'll\r\nsee
  a title (top left) \"SUITES AT THE GARDEN\"  it's a great example of the differences
  between the \"S\" character.\r\n\r\nAny help in identifying this typeface would
  be much appreciated."
