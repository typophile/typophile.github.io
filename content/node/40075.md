  body: "The horizontally cuts ends of \"C\" and \"S\" points Helvetica but the straight
    leg of the \"R\" points to Akzidenz Grotesk...\r\nMaybe a mix of those?"

  body: Quite similar, too, to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/standard-bq/"
    target="_blank">Berthold Standard Light</a>. The two showings I have of predigital
    Standard reveal a straight-legged 'R', as in the sample, as well as extended variants.
    No single variant, though, matches up exactly width-wise with every character
    in the image.
