body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nBare in mind that this is just an idea, nothing solid at all. Please
  do tell me if I'm naive, I have the tendency to be.\r\n\r\nInspired by 'Font Aid'
  (designers submit designs of glyphs for free, a font is made, profit goes to specific
  charity http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Font_Aid) I've started thinking that perhaps
  the typedesign community is capable of even more.\r\n\r\n1. A new foundry, perhaps
  named Fonts For Good, perhaps named differently, is founded.\r\n2. Fontdesigners
  may submit designs.\r\n3. Fontdesigners decide on the percentage of their profit
  on the font that will go to an (as of yet) undefined charity. This percentage may
  be freely picked, but will be mentioned in the fonts' description. (Perhaps a minimum
  should be set? Say, 25%, or something.)\r\n4. At the end of the year, fontdesigners
  may select a number of charities, and buyers and designers (other people involved?)
  of the fonts may vote on which charity (or charities?) the money goes to. \r\n5.
  Condition for every charity is that it is documented (written about, pictures made,
  or best of all, a (short) documentary is made) so that buyers and designers can
  see what has happened to the money.\r\n\r\nQuestions? Yes, certainly.\r\n\r\n1.
  Anyone in?\r\n2. Who's in charge?\r\n3. Is this in any way realistic?\r\n4. If it
  is, what are we waiting for?\r\n5. Any chance the big distributors are willing to
  cooperate. Hi there, Myfonts, Fontshop, Fontspring, etc.\r\n\r\nAgain, just an idea.
  Might be naive. Or foolish. Or whatever.\r\n\r\nCheers! jasper\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think the only problem resides in the fact that, generally speaking, people
    prefer to choose to whom they make donations, so it could be difficult to coordinate
    such an idea, unless there is an unifying theme.

  body: Ahh, yes it seems they no longer exist, sadly. Perhaps a sign that it just
    doesn't work. Too bad.
