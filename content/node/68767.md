  a sans version.\r\nOne example would be foundry's Foundry Form that exists as Foundry
  Form Sans and Foundry Form Serif.\r\nAre there any other typefaces you can think
  of that exist in both versions?\r\n\r\nNext to that i would love to hear about morphing
  typefaces.\r\nI guess im just diving into the world of flexible/dynamic type.\r\nAnyone
  who can introduce me to that world and open the door for me?\r\n\r\nThanx!"
