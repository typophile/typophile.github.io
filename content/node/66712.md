  am an Adjunct Professor in Graphic Design and putting together this semester's curriculum,
  and want to match up some of the major past historic movements with some modern
  examples the might have been influenced by the style. I've been using the same examples
  for years and would like to get some fresh stuff in there this semester, but am
  a little late in making changes, so am seeking some help.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows
  of any good examples of somewhat current graphic design, that appears to reflect
  a strong resemblance to a past movement (Constructivism, DeStijl, Vienna Secession,
  Swiss, etc. Not looking for a match to any particular style, just a (hopefully)
  great design that bears a resemblance to a past movement.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
