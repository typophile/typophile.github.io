  body: "The original name of this typeface is Trooper Roman by Dave Trooper. I think
    this was originally made as a film type by Visual Graphics Corp (VGC) in the early
    1970's. The Serials (Softmaker/TypeShop) fonts are not original designs, although
    they often add weights. They usually change the names too, often keeping the first
    initial the same (Toledo = Trooper). It was also issued in the old FontBank collection
    as TalonBold. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
