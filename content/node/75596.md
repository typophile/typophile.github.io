  (nothing fancy, still learning and experimenting)\r\n\r\nSometimes the left/right
  single quotation marks as well as the double quotation marks just don't work all
  the time when i try and type them in Indesign, they do work sometimes when i use
  the alt-option key but not without, well sometimes they work.\r\n\r\nAlso a strange
  thing is that when i type some text in MS word with this same exact font, everything
  works except when i type the quotation marks it shows default Times New Roman instead
  of the quotation marks that belong to the typeface. I did check for open contours
  in fontlab or something like that but couldn't find it. Does annyone please know
  what this problem could be because i really can't figure it out myself. \r\n\r\nOh
  i did check indesigns setting for typographers quotes and all seems ok\r\n\r\nEvie"

    the right single and right double quotation marks work.\r\n\r\n"

    I don't know how you enter Unicode directly on the Mac, surely someone does. If
    you are using a Windows platform, I can tell you how.\r\n\r\nIf direct entering
    with the Unicode number works, I'd think you can be pretty sure the problem is
    not with the font. Famous last words."

    this a work in progress?\r\n\r\nIf your font does not yet have glyphs for the
    standard straight quotes, then InDesign won't recognize any quotes and won't sub
    smart quotes. However, it should still allow you to type them in directly using
    the opt- and shift-opt bracket keys. \r\n\r\nDoes this describe the behavior you're
    experiencing?\r\n\r\n"

    (which flag you see depends on what language your keyboard is). Click it and change
    it to Unicode Six Input.\r\n\r\nNow, in InDesign: press alt (also called option)
    while you press any Unicode number you want. It should work everywhere, for example
    here:\r\n\r\nalt 2018: \u2018\r\nalt 2019: \u2019\r\nalt 201c: \u201C\r\nalt 201d:

    In Unicode \xE9 is Ux00e9, which is hexadecimal for two hundred and thirty-three.
    Secondly, the quotation marks are in the two rows of characters which don't match
    up with Unicode at all. In the history of computing there have been dozens of
    various encodings and changing standards, so in terms of the final fit it could
    have been a lot worse."
