  body: Thank you. I did that on a book recently, and it was quite tedious work. Maybe
    I should ask my customers to give me the copy with proper quote marks.

    marks you want to use. When importing, InDesign should convert all quotation marks
    to the type of your choice. I think.\r\n\r\nIf your text is already imported,
    basically your @$$ is grass. ;-)"
