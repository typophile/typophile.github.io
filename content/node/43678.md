  loved it. Now he\u2019s trying to identify it to buy it or, if not possible, he\u2019ll
  hire me for a kind of revival (of course, I would do some changes to get a different
  \u2014better?\u2014 font). No matter the answer, the result is fine to me.\r\n\r\nNote
  this: it\u2019s not the De Kuyper logo, because the bottle in the advertisement
  uses a sans serif bold (not scanned).\r\n\r\n"
