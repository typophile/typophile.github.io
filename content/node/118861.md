    also use a 180 deg. rotated /V in place of /A)

  body: Thanks for your reply! The font does look similar but it seems like most of
    the letters in the font I'm searching for have disconnections. You can clearly
    see it in the 'O' for instance. The rotated V for an A could very well be true
    though.

  body: The disconnections you mention are typical in a stencil font, that's why I
    said the font it's probably "artificially stencilized". I can't find any stencil
    font like this, so I believe the disconnections are made by the logo designer
    and are not part of the original font used.
