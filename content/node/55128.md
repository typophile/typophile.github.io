  body: "Hi Eric. I'm the director of Alt Indie Typo, the privately run group working
    on the \"free, open source font superfamily, starting with a linear sans serif\"
    you mention. I recently retired from Typophile but my involvement in the FOSS
    movement necessitates a posting on this thread.\r\n\r\n<em>There will soon be
    a spiffy looking distribution channel for FOSS fonts, maintained by people who
    as far as I can tell are serious about designer\u2019s IP.</em>\r\n\r\nI have
    very little involvement with the Open Font Library, but enuff to know it is run
    by good-intentioned peeple who lack experience making fonts. Mainly they have
    experience making open source software. You only have to examine some of the 160-odd
    free fonts in the openfontlibrary to see the general lack of quality and almost
    complete lack of usable, useful fonts in the collection. So far there isn't much
    at all in the collection many web designers would even consider using.\r\n\r\n<em>There
    is an effort initiated by the typographic community \u2018to make a free, open
    source font superfamily, starting with a linear sans serif\u2019. It\u2019s proceedings
    are not public, which may not accord to the working ethic of the FOSS community,
    but would that matter if they manage to produce great fonts that are licensed
    under a free license?</em>\r\n\r\nAlt Indie Typo operates as a closed group in
    order to get the exacting task of designing our text type series done and get
    all the variants and weights of font made. We leave discussion to venues like
    Typophile and openfontlibrary.org \r\n\r\nI drafted a <a href=\"http://www.openfontlibrary.org/wiki/Alt_Indie_Typo_Group\">management
    framework</a> for the purpose of obtaining a specification for what web designers
    want in the way of open source web fonts, and the response has been disappointing
    in the extreme.\r\n\r\nWeb designers and the Openfontlibrary.org are very keen
    on having a high quality open source text font superfamily yet they have so far
    totally failed to generate a spec for the work. This situation is unworkable and
    impractical so Alt Indie Typo has gone ahead and drafted its own specification
    for the text font superfamily we will build. I just completed an A - Z, a - z
    draft of the serif variant this morning to get an idea of how the final design
    might look.\r\n\r\n<em>Could the different concept of authorship exemplified in
    FOSS add an interesting dimension here? As in, it makes perfect sense to bring
    in a typeface you did not design yourself yet still try to fix it?</em>\r\n\r\nNope.
    That approach smacks of naivity and lack of experience at developing fonts.\r\n\r\n<em>There
    are many existing FOSS fonts out there, of which a large part could presumably
    use tender loving typocare. Wouldn\u2019t it be a very efficient way to increase
    the quality of FOSS type when, for example, your spacing in OpenOffice looks off,
    you just bring up the font here and let the community help you in fixing it?</em>\r\n\r\n\"tender
    loving typo care\" ? I'm compelled to ask you a question: have you designed any
    typefaces yourself? Your example involving off spacing in OpenOffice seems naive
    and attuned to the open source software community, and your solution even more
    naive. If the spacing of Alt Indie Typo's text font superfamily looks off in OpenOffice
    it will be because OpenOffice isn't handling the fonts properly or because some
    users can't handle the fonts properly. Proposing to \"fix\" a well-developed font
    by bringing it here to typophile's crit board is an ad hoc reaction that could
    be avoided altogether with a few judicious tracking adjustments in OpenOffice.\r\n\r\n<em>I
    didn\u2019t see a who\u2019s going to Robothon thread yet, but I am, more of you
    who are interested in the foss type world?</em>\r\n\r\nI dwell in Melbourne, Australia
    and have no interest in Robothon. My interest in the FOSS type word is limited
    to the bare minimum required to communicate with a group of peeple who, in my
    experience, have bitten off more than they can chew.\r\n\r\nFor example, there
    is a basic and serious problem with open source collaborative font building projects.
    Version control software only works on plain text files. That's fine for text
    projects like Wikipedia but hopeless for vector font project file formats like
    Fontlab's .VFB files. So technically no way exists for open source collaboration
    to take place with a version control system to allow a typeface design or font
    build file to be wound back to a desired point in its development history with
    a revert command the way Wikipedians do every day at Wikipedia.\r\n\r\n<em>There
    is a great free font editor, a great free font scripting library, and a very handy
    free-as-in-beer SDK (though I am just echoing the consensus here, can not claim
    personal authority on these matters :-o</em>\r\n\r\nCompared to Fontlab, FontForge
    is not great, and since you're not an authority on these matters I don't understand
    why you say FontForge is great.\r\n\r\nTake it all in good faith because it's
    meant that way.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "I agree with the prevalent opinion that a font which would be stuck together
    in a Wikipedia style direct democracy scenario would be awful. But a font is not
    comparable to a Wikipedia page\u2014rather, it could be comparable to Wikipedia
    itself: a product driven by the vision of an individual, but coming to substance
    through the contributions of the community.\r\n\r\nThis is my own theory which
    I am [[http://authoritism.ericschrijver.nl|propagating]] to both sides of the
    fence:\r\n\r\nMulti-authorship is overrated, and is the least interesting part
    of foss.\r\n\r\n<strong>Multi-authorship is silly</strong>\r\n\r\nThe driving
    force for multi-author projects such as Wikipedia is our incredible skill level
    in conforming to the others around us.\r\nThis is a powerful mechanism: because
    we have such a stubborn drive towards consensus, that even a completely random
    'crowd-sourced' population can create a coherent cultural artefact which, even
    more strikingly, comes across as if it could have been written by a single author.
    (dixit a FoF, will look up)\r\n\r\nYet here is the important part: very often
    the wrong conclusion is drawn from this observation. \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There
    is a diverse amount of people with a diversity in tastes, opinions and longings</li>\r\n<li>These
    people are able to collaboratively create a coherent artefact</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nLeads
    people to conclude\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The resultant artefact necessarily reflects
    the diversity in tastes, opinions and longings of these people<li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThis
    is simply not true. Rather, you can say:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The resultant artefact
    necessarily reflects the common ground this group of people is able to find</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nWhich
    might make it a handy artefact, and very interesting from a sociological perspective,
    but not really interesting in other ways.\r\n\r\n<strong>distributed authorship
    is great</strong>\r\n\r\nBut multi-authorship is not really a prevalent model
    in open source development.\r\nAnd IMHO neither should it be in foss type design.\r\nIn
    my view it is not about loads of people working together on one design, but many
    people working on their own versions and sharing the more general smart ideas
    people come up with.\r\n\r\nIn open source, just like in the arts the need individuals
    feel to <em>differentiate</em> from others plays a very large role.\r\nInspiring
    to me was the surprisingly analytical description of this model in Eric Stephen
    Raymonds 'Homesteading the Noosphere', and more exactly the chapter [[http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s04.html|Open
    Source and Ownership]].\r\n\r\nThis is much more interesting than democratic collaboration
    IMHO, as it is more close to how science or art works: you produce something immaterial
    that you freely spread (\u2018knowledge\u2019, \u2018artistic ideas\u2019) and
    find alternative economic strategies to enable you to keep doing so.\r\n\r\nThis
    approach has arguably brought us some nice things.\r\n\r\nThe big added quality
    of this approach is, that you can build on the work of others. Sort of like type
    revivals, but more directly, because you can quote your contemporaries.\r\n\r\nYou
    could see it that way: an individual or a small team is still responsible for
    a design, but they are feel to pick and choose the bits they like and want to
    adapt from other designs. This might seem a strange idea for a type designer,
    because it seems you could just go and knock about a new typefaces borrowing bits
    and pieces from others; but the reason this works is social pressure. Because
    you are in a small transparent community with a steep barrier of entry, you will
    only want to adapt somebody others work when it is obvious to your pears that
    you are using it in an apt way.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning is that you can create with
    higher sophistication and adapt to smaller niches if you don\u2019t have to reinvent
    the wheel all the time. Like when you use a JavaScript framework like jQuery:
    you have a tried and tested piece of code that abstracts away from the browsers
    implementations so you don\u2019t have to deal with all the mundane details in
    your code.\r\n\r\nThe type equivalent could be making an open source \u2018framework
    family\u2019, an unassuming but robust set of glyphs upon which others can base
    their work, yet are subsequently able to push back specific refinements that also
    apply to the master.\r\n\r\nThat actually sounds like a good idea IMHO. Will look
    into that\u2014the first step could be just stripping Gentium from all it\u2019s
    baroqueness :-)\r\n\r\nBasically it is all about the power of <em>forking</em>\u2014the
    social code hosting site [[http://github.com/|GitHub]] is all about that. In I
    think the OFL license really anticipates these mechanisms very cleverly: by making
    it very clear that if you start redistributing a modified version of a font, you
    should give it a new name and make clear that this is a new font.\r\n\r\nThis
    should prevent what of course is the worrying scenario for type designers: a multitude
    of ill conceived versions of their cherished designs floating around.\r\n\r\nThe
    GitHub example is inspiring to me: &with the UFO format as an xml based representation
    of a font, you have the perfect basis for this kind of granular design, because
    it lends itself extremely well to versioning systems such as SVN and Git. And
    you could even create a graphical interface to the public API of GitHub."

  body: "Well my own main preocupation with type is as a tool to connect to the visual
    part of our cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nSince these typefaces should preferably
    be free, and seeing how arriving at only a few decent free typefaces already proves
    to be such an ordeal, I\u2019d say the hopes for a decent amount of historic free
    revival are slim.\r\n\r\nBut with this sort of distributed authorship I could
    imagine, for example, the following scenario:\r\n\r\nA library has a specific
    and rich collection of late 19th century books from one specific press, that cut
    its own type.\r\n\r\nThey decide to digitize the collection. And they commision
    a font designer to design digital type for it, because they want to digitise it
    in a way that is at the same time accesible and flexible, and fitting the visual
    presentation of the originals.\r\n\r\nThe type director, or lead designer, starts
    studying the portfolio of typefaces. He takes all the time, effort and dedication
    as he would in a normal assignment. But he is not studying one typeface: he is
    studying a collection of type, looking for its essential characteristics, finding
    out which individual differences he wants to emphasize and which ones he will
    attach less value too.\r\n\r\nHe proposes a master plan [sic], and if the client
    agrees, the distributed part starts. At first he will just have a few assistants
    helping him set up the main skeletons for the prototypical faces of the collection.
    But after that point he will start to look for specific designers that can start
    working on specific problems that they specialise in.\r\n\r\nThis is where the
    forking starts, when different designers start working on different parts of different
    designs. The lead is the one who is minding the grand plan, but at any given point
    is able to use his very specific judgment on details if necessary. He is also
    the one who can pull in changes from one font and push them back to others.\r\n\r\nYou
    will end up with a collection of typefaces, the richness of which the lead designer
    could not have created on his own. Not only for lack of time, but also because
    the unique skills the contributors have contributed, skills not found combined
    in one person. Yet on the other hand, the type collection has all the qualities
    you would attribute to a traditional type family as designed by an individual.
    The different fonts are not described as individual entities, but in their relationship
    to each other, starting from the prototypical design bases created by the lead
    designer, who is also the one who has been making sure the collection works as
    a whole.\r\n\r\n__\r\n[[http://authoritism.ericschrijver.nl|art directing the

    or less the same phenomenon as with previous free fonts, the impact can\u2019t
    be that huge on the professional community? Because this whole free-as-in-beer
    free-as-in-freedom distinction has nowhere near the relevance it has for the Foss
    community.\r\n\r\nBut the benefits to Open Source would be huge IMHO.\r\nBecause
    a talented type student might not be able to make a typeface like a veteran designer,
    he will make a typeface which is 100x better than that of someone who just feels
    like drawing some letters on a rainy sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\nSo if all these
    eager to prove themselves cultural professionals start using OSS licences as opposed
    to giving away proprietary freebies in exchange for e-mail addresses or whatever
    scheme they come up with, wouldn\u2019t that constitute a great starting point

    system. No glyphs with accents. No unecessary flips (brackets, less than, backslash
    etc.) Any characters that can be constructed automatically or by following simple
    instructions would be left out. A spec doc would specify all of this. Them more

    is on the font designer.\r\n\r\nA team of reliable type testers who send detailed
    reports back to the type designer and the rest of the team. Moving bezier handles
    isn't time consuming, knowing where to move them is. You need good testers who
    will actually print stuff on actual paper and look at it with actual eyes. If
    your testers just look at stuff in Fontlab and say \"looks nice.\" then it can
    cause a lot of work down the line. Especially with interpolation. You want to
    make sure the source fonts are perfect or you can end up with he same mistake
    repeated 64 times, adding to the font designer's workload. So, you need real,
    professional typographers that happen to enjoy working for free.\r\n\r\nA kerner.
    If only one person kerns, no version control is required. They just need to upload
    the latest kern file. With class based kerning it's not so tough, even for a large
    project. It's work but one hotshot kerner with skills can do it if they know how

    based on the font designer's instructions. For example:\r\nafii10048 - generate
    I_E_O decompose E and extract the midline. place the O two periods distance away
    from the I. Adjust length of horizontal line and remove overlaps. Copy right sidebearing
    from the O. That sort of thing. Font monkey may not be the best name for this
    position.\r\n\r\nInterpolators. Blending regular and bold to make semibold aint
    no thang. The font designer probably wouldn't even need to be involved in minor
    interpolations. Just the testers. It's often more of a cleanup job than a design
    job. The font designer would have the final tweak on each interpolation but the
    initial cleanup should be done by someone else.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's something I've
    thought about for years. Just as a \"what if\" scenario. Multiple font designers
    aimlessly poking around at a font sounds like a nightmare. It might work in an
    office environment but over the net it's a wheelbarrow of pain."

    browsers, so they benefit by web apps taking off, 37signals makes web apps with
    the Rails framework, so they benefit from it being popular.\r\n\r\nSo I guess
    there has to be an investing party that sees a potential for foss fonts improving

    not just about perfect letterforms. It's about good planning, a coherent spec
    and an organized team or professionals.\r\n\r\n@scott. I should have explained
    that everyone involved would have to be a talented font designer. Everyone involved
    would have to be an experienced professional for a project like that to work.
    Don't get me wrong about font monkeys. There's no difference between font designer
    and font monkey. That's just their position on the project. So someone could be
    a font monkey on project A and font maestro on project B. Getting a team like
    that to work with no money might sound implausible. That's because it is.\r\n\r\nThat's
    what I believe to be the ideal method of creating a large collaborative font family.
    If you take the same formula, replace most of the people with inexperienced amateurs
    and one professional, you'll likely end up with one frustrated professional. I'm
    not saying you can make a collaborative font using other methods but if anyone
    can poke holes in my plan and suggest how it could be improved, go ahead.\r\n\r\nMake
    no mistake: I don't want to get involved in a collaborative project. I just had

    presence of a single leader who protects the vision and quality of the software.
    In the case of really big projects, this may be a handful of people who work very

    would be true for a quality open font project. A single designer needs to be the
    Tzar - even if that slows down the project. Whether the project has 1 or 100 contributors,
    someone needs to take design responsibility. That's true even for commercial foundries,
    where one person adds glyphs, one kerns, one write OT code, etc.\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't

    I think FOSS is no single entity, it is just the sum of all people who happen

    to fill very specific needs proprietary software will never be able to address),

    think it is an unprecedented accomplishment!\r\n\r\nBut this brings me to a specific
    point, which I myself failed to address in the examples I gave\u2026\r\nIt seems
    there is a consensus on the need for a Tzar.\r\nI definitely agree. But IMHO the
    radical thing open source changes is not so much the possibility to have one Tzar
    with a lot of footmen, but the ability to have Tzar\u2019s easily pick up where
    they deem other Tzar\u2019s to have stopped.\r\n\r\nAnd what to me is evident,
    is that this how culture works anyway. It is like making a revival. There was
    a designer with a vision. You build upon what he has done, and in the process
    make it your own. And the original still exists.\r\n\r\nThe thing open source
    can do is take that process, but allow it to take place much more rapidly, because
    you do not have to wait more than a century for something to pass into the public
    domain.\r\n\r\n<cite>We shouldn\u2019t assume that all free/open projects are
    even interested in outside contributors. Many are, but some people choose open
    licenses as a way to distribute the software and allow derivatives, not to get

    if the speed is too glacial or the designer wants to do it all themselves. (Obligatory
    apologies to everyone for the long Gentium development cycle, which does involve
    a number of people.)</cite>\r\n\r\nExactly. We need to get over the fear of open
    source being about wanton collaboration blurring typographic vision. It can just
    as well be a catalyst in enabling the production of a multitude of diverse and
    highly individualist expressions.\r\n\r\nLicensing your own work under on open
    source license to me says: I presume this can be valuable to other people in a
    way I don\u2019t know yet. Or: I presume this can be valuable to other people
    in a way I can not concentrate on myself.\r\n \r\nA great example I think of this
    reasoning by @James releasing his Fry glyphs.\r\nKnowing he was not going to have
    the time to make a font out of it anyway, giving it away makes a lot of sense:
    you spend time making something nice.\r\n\r\nAnd while we have been talking about
    these things on a hypothetical level, these ways of collaboration are actually
    taking place, showing that at least in part the lack of these kind of projects
    has had to do with a lack of suitable technology. With versioning systems going
    mainstream, and the UFO format as an XML based font description format, the technical
    groundwork is there IMHO.\r\n\r\n<strong>concretely</strong>\r\n\r\n@James donated
    the Fry glyphs late January, @Klepas started a project a few days later, the files
    were up on GitHub in the UFO format Feb 8th. While I was busy writing on typophile
    last weekend, I mentioned a student I tutor the Open Baskerville URL in an e-mail.
    The next day he ([[http://robmientjes.nl/|Rob]]) had forked the project, and had
    actually started drawing glyphs for it!\r\n\r\nSo this week he has been making
    his additions to his own fork\r\nhttp://github.com/rbmntjs/open-baskerville/commits/master\r\nAnd
    friday @klepas pulled Rob\u2019s additions back in to the original repository\r\nhttp://github.com/klepas/open-baskerville/commits/master\r\n\r\nThe
    workings of GitHub are also explained on the homepage http://klepas.org/openbaskerville/\r\nSeeing
    how the [[http://unifiedfontobject.org/|UFO]] format is XML-based and concise,
    it is perfect for versioning.\r\nBut of course looking at text is still not a
    very pleasant way to browse a fonts assets.\r\n\r\nBut every different glyph has
    it\u2019s own concise XML file, and translating that to SVG with XSLT or the like
    should be perfectly possible.\r\n\r\nSo even though there is no font yet, at least
    we have a proof of concept that this way of working is technologically possible.\r\nIt
    also shows the power of open licensing. @James donated the glyphs without knowing
    @Klepas would pick them up. @Klepas started the project without knowing Rob would
    start to contribute. And if @james is still coming to Robothon, we might be able
    to have a look at what his glyphs have been up to, a mere month after he let them
    loose, since Rob will also be attending.\r\n\r\nFor me this experience combined
    with the substantial way in which we have been able to explore these ideas on
    the forum this week, gives me the incentive to say, that for now I will try and
    light a fire under the open source font movement\u2026\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll get back

  body: "Re: Managing Contributions\r\n\r\nFirst, hi Victor! It seems these discussions
    always break down into how fonts can't work in an open source software model.
    I get that. The recent swing in the conversation to version control and contribution
    management is welcome. It seems to me that this is where the open source community
    could really help a collaborative font effort, and type designers generally. \r\n\r\n<strong>In
    recent discussions we font folk have been daring open source folk to provide a
    design brief. It might make more sense for <em>us</em> to give <em>them</em> a
    design brief for the web application required to pull it off.</strong> Surely
    the result would be useful to the type design community for commercial projects
    as well. If we each stick with what we're good at, it just might be possible for
    both parties to benefit.\r\n\r\n<strong>A very crude idea about what such an application
    might look like:</strong>\r\nI'm envisioning a web application that is the centralized
    repository for the font project. In my \"limited\" experience with collaborative
    font projects, removing the sprawl from contributor hard-drives seems vital. Having
    a central visual reference that shows missing puzzle pieces would be equally crucial.
    Permissions would define the roles suggested (Tzar, Monkey etc tbd). Contributors
    could check-out \"under construction\" glyphs for a limited time (like a library).
    When you check out the \"germandbls\" glyph you get a package containing: any
    existing versions of the glyph, notes from the Tzar, links to design resources
    for the glyph (see diacritics project.cz etc) and any components that would be
    helpful in designing the glyph (in this case the lc f and s). Tzars could communicate
    vision and revision effectively. Clearly thought needs to be put into the format
    of the files. Keeping everything online would encourage participation: an online
    glyph editor with package contents readily available for reference seems ideal,
    but difficult to implement. Package download, edit, upload seems easier, but more
    limiting ( perhaps a UFO->EPS->UFO or UFO->VBF->UFO on a glyph by glyph basis
    to allow vector drawing programs to get in on the mix? I don't know. \r\n\r\n<strong>The
    main goals would be:</strong> \r\n\u2022\_For Tzars, maximize single-ness of vision
    and minimize admin headache\r\n\u2022 For Monkeys, breaking tasks into well-defined,
    bite-sized chunks (one glyph, or group of glyphs)\r\n\r\nObviously developing
    this is a gargantuan task. But many hands make light work, right? Haha. Thoughts?"

    for chiming in!\r\n\r\nI agree with you in doubting a \u2018spec\u2019 is all
    that important. Like if there would somehow appear a spec for a FOSS font family,
    and we would have some money, some computers, some drinks and a few weeks in a
    nice house near lake Como, type designing hotshots could just conjure up a nice
    and flexible type family, give it away, and forever end the need for free fonts
    and typographic collaboration in general.\r\n\r\nI am interested in a distributed
    model of authorship, for which open source and collaboration happen to provide
    the means. I think these models provide benefits that can not be attained through
    the traditional ways of working. If I just wanted a typeface I would buy it (really!).\r\n\r\nLike
    @V said, the tools needed for such a way of working could just as well be suited
    for commercial foundries.\r\n\r\nBut did any of you check out the links I posted?\r\nOpen
    Baskerville is working in this sort of way right now.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Afbeelding_220_kopie_4388.png]\r\n\r\nhttp://github.com/klepas/open-baskerville/commits/master\r\n\r\nI
    am really curious of what you think of that. Because GitHub does ALL the things
    @Randy describes, save for visualising the UFO data as an EPS, SVG, PNG, whatever.
    Which really is the most trivial part to implement. I will try and give it a go
    the coming week.\r\n\r\n<em>Contributions</em>\r\n\r\nWith regards to copyright
    of contributions, there are established practices in the open source world, I
    found this one to be pretty concise: http://www.movabletype.org/opensource/contributions.html\r\n\r\nBut
    I do see @V how that generates a large amount of amount of administrative hassle.
    Though I guess it is not necessarily designers that would be handling this. And
    like @Randy says, it makes sense to expect some collaboration on these matters
    from the Open Source world.\r\n__\r\n[[http://authoritism.ericschrijver.nl|art

    of the coding model that should inform collaborative fonting. However, this tool
    would only be helpful to someone steeped in the coding world. Who is your audience?
    Who are your collaborators? For this to be a success it needs to look and work
    a lot more like the latest release of Wordpress. Sure you could blog from the

    exactly in the direction I expected. In the worst case, the additions are sub-standard,
    like you can see in the image below. In the best case you end up redrawing someone
    else\u2019s glyphs (Fry\u2019s in this case). I'm sceptical about this kind of
    \"open\" collaboration, but of course I'd love to be proven wrong, by a well-executed

    drawn (more visible in close-up) and some don't follow the original style. Which
    isn't a bad thing in itself \u2013 everyone was a beginner at some point \u2013
    but you have to keep in mind these glyphs haven't been posted on the TP critique
    section, where probably some people would have been glad to help improve them,
    but they are presented as the progress in a project which seems to aim at no less
    than revolutionizing the way collaborative typedesign works. As I said, all contributions
    would be measured to the original Fry\u2019s Baskerville, so the possibly best
    result would still be reproducing someone else\u2019s work. \r\n\r\nDo something
    original instead.\r\n\r\n<em>Like @V said, the tools needed for such a way of
    working could just as well be suited for commercial foundries.</em>\r\n\r\nMaybe,
    but I guess the established foundries already have their internal production systems,
    and I doubt they would be willing to publicize large parts of them in order to
    get contributions from FOSS people.\r\n\r\nAre you familiar with <a href=\"http://www.fontqa.com/\">FontQA</a>?
    That is an open-source project for font quality assurance licenced under GPL.
    I'd have to ask, but I think there were not many contributions, if any at all,
    from anybody not directly involved in the project. Why is that? I think the audience
    is too small, font production is a too specialized area in which a few people
    already have their own solution, while the majority won't even see the need for
    such a tool.\r\n\r\nIt may be the same for the proposed \"visual glyph versioning
    and font production system\". It would have to be developed by people who really
    use it, and know a thing or two about professional font production. And then probably
    it would be next to useless to other people whose collaboration workflow differs."

    is exactly the conclusion I came to myself, and the attitude I would like to be
    propagating!\r\n\r\nAlso, I think you are the first to on this thread to articulate
    the possibility of Open Source actually doing anything <em>for you</em>. Great!
    Because why would you want to have anything to do with it otherwise? Speaking
    of motivations, I tried to formulate mine in the form of a [[http://typophile.com/node/55332|concise
    list @ my user blog]]\r\n\r\nI would phrase one thing differently now though:
    the part that struck me about Open Source is IMHO <em>a specific subset of open
    source</em>, and I guess it is the part that has come in contact with both creativity
    and business. IMHO this is the world where the investment of entering a bit has
    a probable return of investment.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the utopian super-easy GUI
    programs might come along\u2014but for that we need to have entered a bit more,
    and a bit longer: and we would have had to have tried to redecorate the house
    up to the point where we feel comfortable sleeping over\u2026\r\n\r\nAs example
    GH again, they promote themselves as Online project hosting for Open Source and
    Business code. They have a very clear business model, because public code is free
    to host, but they reason that the user experience will make you also want to host
    your private code there. So basically, Open Source development is the freemium
    they offer: if that does not show how the tables have turned, what will?\r\n\r\nWhere
    creativity comes into play IMHO is that the whole affair is steeped in the individualist
    logic of web 2.0. You want your <em>own</em> version of a package, and you want
    to be able to show your friends what you have. That might sound superficial instead
    of creative, but the underlying needs driving it are comparable IMHO: the struggle
    between the need for differentiation and self-expression on the one hand, and
    on the other hand the need to feel accepted by others.\r\n\r\nPart of this echoes
    what @sii said earlier, about how OSS fonts will probably come about because of
    those interested in economical and social opportunities joining in as well. In
    that sense Open Baskerville might also be a good example, because even though
    I might be pointing you at this open source project, I myself have no background
    in open source, and the three authors involved in OpenB up to this point have
    a background in design, not in open source development. Now they might be mistaken
    by the opportunities these projects offer them, but the fact that they do so shows
    a significant change.\r\n\r\nYet arguably, the point of discussion is not on that,
    but rather on the question: to what extent does this impact the practice of the
    cutural industry (and of open source) as we know it? Because I think these interdisciplinary
    developments will fundamentally impact all parties involved, even if specific
    members choose not to investigate these fringes.\r\n\r\n&I do not agree with @Jens,
    but will come back on that.\r\n\r\nEric\r\n__\r\n[[http://authoritism.ericschrijver.nl|art

    if they could maybe support some of my ventures, and seeing how I have been such
    a fanboy for them in this thread, I figured that it makes sense to state this
    now to avoid future confusion: it is not GitHub per se that constitutes the promise
    for these kind of models. They just happen to bring together two things I strongly
    believe in: empowering non-geeks by allowing them to use very specific technology,
    by focusing on what you can do it instead of what it does (fork it!). And propagating
    a distributed model for content, as opposed to a centralized one.</cite>\r\n"

    the procent sign) are not correctly designed. For example, everything about that
    % seems off: it is too narrow, the slash shouldn't have a serif, and the top connecting
    stroke is out of place\u2026 I don't think that Fry's Baskerville is a calligraphic

    I bet that the original \u0152 form would have looked different than what your

    design isn't something that you can just pick up and try out. Every glyph has
    to be as good as every other one in the fots (and family). I think that it might
    be best for him to try and get a glyph right on his own local computer first (including
    lots of revisions and print outs, etc.) before thinking of uploading it back to
    the project tree for inclusion."

    I will admit the \u2018just come over and show us your glyphs\u2019 stance often
    taken around here is proving to be very true.\r\n\r\n@dan_reynolds\r\n<cite>I
    think that it might be best for him to try and get a glyph right on his own local
    computer first (including lots of revisions and print outs, etc.) before thinking
    of uploading it back to the project tree for inclusion.</cite>\r\n\r\nI generally
    agree with you. However, two things: this is exactly the paradigm shift distributed
    versioning brings: there is no one central project tree. The project tree @Rob
    was pushing back to this week, was his own fork. On friday, @Klepas pulled back
    the design changes to the originating repository. However, @Klepas decided to
    designate @Rob as an author, meaning @Rob can no also push to the tree directly.\r\n\r\nThing
    two: Of course it would normally be a bit strange to draw your shared attention
    to the collaborative type design efforts of a graphic designer and a graphic design
    student, the latter\u2019s contributions representing actually the first digital
    glyphs he has ever drawn. I of course explicitly asked his permission to do so,
    since the prospect of these  glyphs coming under the scrutiny of the typophile
    community is daunting.\r\n\r\nThat is why the glyphs in the form that @Jens saw
    them would never have been posted to the crit-board. A place like the crit-board
    has it\u2019s place, definitely. But the association I have is not that of the
    place where you exchange thoughts in the middle of your process, but rather a
    place where you yourself take a step back and let others evaluate your work: like
    an evaluation at school, I guess.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant to show is the ease with
    which these kind of new working methods allow you to chime in at any part of the
    process, to give your opinion, but not only in a desinterested way: you can become
    a user, a co-developer, and none of these roles are fixed.\r\n\r\n@Jens The reason
    I do not agree with you is not because of your professional assesment of the glyphs,
    which (@Raph) might be valid. The thing is, they have no relevance to the point
    you are trying to make. I am not showing these glyphs as an example of a typeface,
    I intend to show a way of working. You asses on a snapshot out of this process,
    and subsequently dismiss the progress. That is like dismissing a video camera
    because the quality of the still pictures it makes do not live up to those of
    a photo camera.\r\n\r\nFurther down I expand on that.\r\n\r\n@Nick_Shinn\r\n<cite>The
    spec should be related to the project\u2019s raison d\u2019\xEAtre if the product
    is to be meaningful and useful art or design.</cite>\r\n+1!\r\nIMHO, any spec.
    But I think that is the implicit assumption :-)\r\n\r\nOnly, I still do not really
    understand the kind of typeface you are proposing?\r\nI am not really able to
    place things like metafont style.\r\nCould you maybe elaborate a bit on the specific
    properties of this typeface, and the way they are relate to its context?\r\n\r\n<cite>Who
    gets to decide which is the default glyph for each character?</cite>\r\n<cite>How
    are such decisions made in typical open source design projects?</cite>\r\n\r\nNick
    these are IMHO exactly the right questions, for which the Art Libre movement,
    as far as I can tell, has not proposed any substantial hypotheses. Open source
    programming seems to have a well documented history of how people deal with their
    differing opinions. But to be honest, I don\u2019t think that at the moment we
    have actually seen any real open source design projects [1]. Most Open Source
    fonts are as far as I can tell still very much individual products. Which is rather
    unrelated to the promise of Open Source.\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis on why that is:
    if you are a computer programmer, you are very well aware of just how complicated
    a system a computer program is. You are less aware that visual communication is
    exactly the same in that regard: a complex system of interrelated signifiers.\r\n\r\nBecause
    how could you otherwise come up with a solution like stylesheets? It implies that
    the basic layout is hardcoded into the system, which is the last place where any
    designer would want it to be.\r\n\r\nWhich probably means we are allowed the opening
    move.\r\n\r\n<cite> It would be nice if I could also name the Stylistic Set \u201CShinn\u201D,
    rather than have it identified just by a number, as is now the case in the OpenType
    format.</cite>\r\n\r\nSounds great, and if I am not mistaken this exactly what
    the concept of branches within Git allows you to do.\r\nThese sort of things could
    also be really handy in developing routines for things like subsetting, I guess\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    in what follows I try to describe what a concrete Git-based workflow could be,
    taking OpenB as an example and trying to address some of the specific possibilities
    mentioned. I would like to try and add this sort of stuff to the wiki if @all
    sees the use for it? I already added a general page on [[Revision Control]].\r\n\r\n@Raph
    the glyphs would be great! But IMHO this would have even more added value would
    if I we try and see if we can get that submitted through the versioning system,
    or maybe a ticket system (I heard GitHub has easy connection to LightHouse, which
    presumably is a hosted ticket system), because then we can assess the feasibility
    of that part of this workflow."

  body: "<strong>Using GitHub</strong>\r\n<em>OpenBaskerville Git workflow with the
    _Shinn branches</em>\r\n\r\nIf you choose to work on the Baskerville typeface,
    there are three codebases ('repositories'):\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>@Klepas\u2019 repository</li>\r\n<li>Your
    own repository on GitHub, which you forked from @Klepas\u2019 one</li>\r\n<li>The
    local repository on your own computer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nEach repository can
    have an infinite number of <em>branches</em>.\r\nYou might choose to make one
    you call <code>_Klepas</code>, which can be the branch that you pull in all @Klepas
    changes from, without automatically adding them to your own working copy called
    <code>_Shinn</code>\u2014you might want to skip on the changes that don't benefit
    <code>_Shinn</code>\u2026\r\n\r\nSee the distributed part? Automatically, you
    can apply the same scrutiny to @Klepas' changes to the design, as you can to your
    own!\r\n\r\nAlso, getting back to @James' original glyphs is dead-easy, you could
    just traverse the history right back to the beginning.\r\n\r\nYou might have a
    <code>_Shinn_WorkingCopy</code> branch, and set up a job to push the changes to
    <code>_Shinn_Nightly</code> every 24 hours @ 00:00.\r\nThat is how this thing
    called <em>nightly builds</em> comes about.\r\n\r\nYou might also have a branch
    <code>_Shinn_Extreme</code>, which you normally keep synched with <code>_Shinn_WorkingCopy</code>,
    but which you switch to when you have an exceptionally extreme aesthetic impulse
    :-)\r\n\r\nYou regulary push back your local repository to your hosted repository.
    There are no hard rules about how you want to do this: some might prefer to push
    back less often, with more coherent sets of commits\u2013others would just have
    it push back automatically every 10 minutes or so, making it twitter-style coding.\r\n\r\n<em>On
    your own computer</em>\r\n\r\n<code>$ git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/open-baskerville.git</code>\r\n\r\nYou
    start working on a glyph on your own computer. No for you as a user Git is completely
    transparent. The only difference between a git-enabled folder and a normal folder,
    is that the former contains a directory called <code>.git</code>, which contains
    the revision history. Because it starts with a dot, it is normally invisible.\r\n\r\nThis
    also means there is no processing overhead. Nothing happens if you edit a file,
    save a file, or whatever. So you are free to tinker around. However, at any given
    moment where you think you made a change which is significant enough to version,
    you <code>$ git commit -am</code>. You are prompted for a description, and the
    current version of the file is added to the revision history.\r\n\r\nThis works
    in a similarl way to wikis.\r\n\r\nWhy this is funky, is that this makes sense
    as a workflow even when you are not collaborating at all. It is basically granular
    backup. And by dividing your commits in logical steps, and describing them as
    you would to another person, you are firstly doing yourself a favor: your granular
    backup also becomes structured and searchable. [2]\r\n\r\nIn the sketched scenario,
    BTW, you do not only have backups, they are automatically off-site as well, since
    you push to a remote server.\r\n\r\n<em>On the hosted repository</em>\r\n\r\nYou
    regularly <code>git push</code> back to the repository on github. \r\n\r\nUsing
    GitHub is as trivial as geek gets, see http://klepas.org/openbaskerville/#using-git\r\n\r\nI
    did not try out other distributed systems (Darcs, Bazaar, Mercurial), they are
    probably more alike then they are different, but git just so happens to be the
    on used for this project. @Rob taught he me how to use it in one hour yesterday.
    There are only two specific geek hoops:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>if you are going to
    be installing open source software on OS X, doing so without package control software
    like [[MacPorts]] [3] is masochism.</li>\r\n<li>your computer has to have a public

    as a teacher into question. Neither of those things are elements that I could
    adequately judge online anyway, nor do I want to do these things, online or offline.
    I have read all of your comments on this tread, and have followed this discussion
    with interest. That is why I was so surprised that, what I saw as really good
    feedback from Jens, was not taken!\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that you started this
    thread to start the ball rolling about a discussion on a new process for designing
    typeface design, and how this could be a group activity. I would be interested
    to see a good program like this in action. However, the proof of a typeface's
    quality is not the process by which it is made, but how well it functions in its
    intended usage environment. A typeface doesn't become intrinsically better because
    ten or 100 people work on, as opposed to one (or however many).\r\n\r\nI'm concerned
    with letters, and with typefaces that work well, offering new tools to graphic
    designers and document makers. I want all undertaken typefaces, including the
    Open Baskerville project, to result in good, useful fonts. That is why I worry
    about trying to create a perfect system for managing collaboration without first
    having quality letters. To me, the resulting letterforms are more important than
    the process that brings them into the font. Jens sounds like a voice in the wilderness,
    trying to bring in the voice of good type, and his voice is not being heeded.
    I think that Jens's opinions are very important. He works with a small team of
    people that produce some of the highest quality fonts on the market. I suspect
    that he knows a lot more about good collaborative font-making processes than I
    do.\r\n\r\nIn general\u2014and I'll admit that this does not have anything to
    do with the topic of your thread\u2014I view the idea that the way for beginners
    to enter the field of type design is by joining up onto the back of a bigger project
    coordinated by someone else with a lot of skepticism. Aren't the best filmmakers
    the ones who as kids filmed whole movies in their basement, instead of people
    to try to spend decades working their way up the ladder of the industry production
    chain? It wasn't so many years ago that I drew my first letters and first fonts.
    I've been able to watch many new designers enter our field over the past half
    decade or so as well\u2026 I think that he best way to learn how to make good
    typefaces is to start making your own letters and typefaces. Learning about typefaces
    by joining a big internet group font design project seems like a paradigm shift
    that I would not feel comfortable recommending."

    some might note, skipping others blatantly. If you feel like you\u2019d like something
    answered of have any otherwise specific concerns please do point them out.\r\n\r\nI
    want to first proclaim I am myself not a type designer; I am more of a typographer
    but with the full intention of becoming a type designer over the coming years.
    I sadly have no access to tertiary type design courses at my university currently,
    so I am teaching myself in my spare time, as I have done thus far with most of
    the design-related skills that I have acquired.\r\n\r\nSecondly, although not
    a programmer, I would consider myself affiliated with at least some part of the
    FOSS community, namely the Aussie network here in Down Under. I regularly attend
    related conferences, reside on a few IRC project channels and take part in local
    special interest and user groups. I\u2019ve contributed to small number of projects
    over the years, namely the Tango Desktop Project and the Ubuntu Artwork team.
    My participation has dwindled somewhat since my starting of private work and uni,
    but I definitely intend to stick about and, I figured, the best way that also
    coincided with many of my current interests, is with a type-related project. I
    am entirely comfortable in not being the \u2018Tzar\u2019 regarding the Open Baskerville
    project; I was more keen to get a project going, even if that meant lacking a
    specification at commencement. There\u2019s a common saying in the FOSS world:
    \u2018show me the code\u2019, and although it doesn\u2019t apply directly, that\u2019s
    what I wanted to do: get something out there that would stimulate discussion and
    foster interests to make additions and improvements, even if they come in small
    doses.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to tackle the understanding that small contributions
    from numerous contributors can\u2019t be effectively managed or decided upon (in
    terms of which is the best). I\u2019ll try to do this using an example: Rob mentioned
    to me that he wanted to attempt drawing the commercial at-sign (\u2018@\u2019),
    which given the specimens we are using, isn\u2019t featured (the character being
    created centuries after Fry\u2019s Baskerville was cut). I have great respect
    in his enthusiasm and this bold move. I want to clarify I don\u2019t expect \u2018perfect\u2019
    glyphs or contributions (not to mention assessments are a subjective issue). The
    focal point here is that Rob did in fact draw a glyph that we don\u2019t yet have
    which has fostered a discussion about it. We could have discussed it first, before
    opening our font editor, but much like the \u2018show me the code\u2019 concept,
    I think many of us like the idea of viewing a concept glyph, rather than trying
    to describe it using just words. All it takes then is for another to come along,
    view it and provide feedback, or if they are keen, heck, a subtle change that
    illustrates their opinion (and with direct access to the UFO source files, the
    process is made much easier!).\r\n\r\nThis method is not too dissimilar to that
    of what most of us, I think, would consider \u2018professional type design\u2019,
    whereby the processes of conceptualising our thoughts graphically, analysing the
    outcome, and making edits accordingly, through repetition leads to the steady
    improvement of our glyph(s). The only additional factors here are a community
    engagement in between these stages.\r\n\r\nThere is a famous saying: \u2018too
    many cooks spoil the broth\u2019, and rightly it applies to the FOSS methodologies
    too, but I believe this concern can be overcome: if there are three or four participants
    in a discussion over a certain glyph, start work on another, and hey, if it really
    comes down to it there\u2019s still a Chief Cook who can resolve disputes and
    have a final word. In the case of many FOSS projects benevolent dictator (e.g.
    Mark Shuttleworth and the Ubuntu project) or just the most respected member of
    that community (or hey, even both). I think it is an erroneous judgement that
    any project, community or society will function without some form of conflict\u2014it
    happens in our professional lives, hobbies, friendships, marriages, and yes, the
    free and open source world. :)\r\n\r\nI believe the right to call the shots comes
    through respect; if I do not have the respect of my peers in a group then there
    are fundamental forces that will tear at the project and be in conflict of the
    its aims. I decided to take the initiative to launch this project because I believed
    just giving the metaphorical ball a push would set things in motion (and I believe
    it has); I would gladly pass along any sense of ownership to another who is more
    respected and able-bodied, and with a distributed model (via Git), this does not
    require a revolt and revolution.\r\n\r\nThis considered, even the addition of
    glyphs that vaguely similar stylistically to Open Baskerville project\u2019s should
    I believe be valued, for they provide a starting point (thank you Ralph!). Of
    course some may choose to ignore these entirely; I like to draw glyphs by hand
    in my sketchbook first, and not edit existing glyphs to match my style; it\u2019s
    up to the individual, and ultimately all work will be evaluated by the peers of
    the project, so even if a contribution was made that is not accurately in style
    of the project, it can be discussed and improved as per the aforementioned workflow.\r\n\r\nEric:

    advice are of great value to this project, and if you feel up to it, would like

    with that, I should mention one final thing: the issue tracker. If you do not
    have any desire to contribute to the project with your own glyphs or in the message
    threads, but feel obligated to make some thoughts heard, please feel free to add
    \u2018tickets\u2019 to the issue tracker. A ticket is a little note of an error

    most easy way to see it, I guess, is that every individual type designer who starts
    to partake in such a design project, is from that moment on working on his <em>own</em>
    version of the font.\r\n\r\nThe added value of the development model is that there
    is a very solid collaboration system in place, that easily allows you to include
    the changes other designers make to the design base that you both forked from.\r\n\r\nBut
    you have full control over which changes to your design you allow.\r\n\r\nThat
    this is not really being followed in software development (as far as I know) is
    probably because it is not very useful in that situation, with most changes to
    the codebase being bug fixes.\r\n\r\nThe actual lines of code that make up a typeface
    are an order of magnitude less than those in most software programs, which make

    think our views are actually pretty similar. I will expand on this, please correct
    me if I am wrong.\r\n\r\n<cite>It seems to me that you started this thread to
    start the ball rolling about a discussion on a new process for designing typeface
    design, and how this could be a group activity.</cite>\r\n\r\nBecause I think
    you are right in that, but we do have a different take on this subject, and the
    difference is subtle. I think we could could state it this way: at this point
    I am more interested in this process than I am in the typefaces it produces, and
    for you it is the other way around?\r\n\r\nWhich makes sense, because between
    the two of us, you are the type designer. If we would arrive at the point where
    either a) these processes start producing typefaces of professional quality or
    b) typefaces of professional quality start to be produced with this processes\u2014only
    then will our interests coincide, no?\r\n\r\nI will be the first to admit that
    I do not see that happening shortly, if ever. There will IMHO always be a market
    for high quality typefaces conceived and executed by an individual designer with
    a strong typographic vision. Just as there will IMHO always  be fringes the market
    will not be able to cater to, and Open Source / collaborative practices will provide
    an alternative.\r\n\r\nThat is exactly why I do not think @Jens\u2019 judgment
    is undervalued, or his critique is that of a lone voice in the wilderness. I do
    trust the capacities of these forums\u2019 members to make these kind of judgments.
    Otherwise, it would have made no sense to come here. I just think his reasoning
    to dismiss the potential of collaboration models based on the first efforts produced
    by the people who just happen to be first to use them, is ill-conceived.\r\n\r\nYou
    could turn it around. Shouldn\u2019t type designers be interested in exactly what
    it is, that makes visual artists, graphic designers and computer geeks band up
    to take the actual effort to start developing new development methods for type
    design? At the point where we would band up to ask type designers to give us free
    fonts, you can still dismiss us as cheapskates. But the fact that we are taking
    all this effort clearly shows that the current produce of the type industry does
    not meet our needs.\r\n\r\nAnd I do not think anyone involved in these efforts
    would state the superiority or even the relevance of their typographic judgment
    as primary factors involved.\r\n\r\nSo why not be a bit more curious to find out
    what <em>is</em> driving us? Ultimately, regardless of your stance in all the
    ideological bickering, this seems to be a very real issue among the public, who
    are your potential public, and ultimately your revenue stream.\r\n\r\nWith a similar
    reasoning, I am inclined to value the judgments of the forum members on the quality
    of letterforms higher than my own. That is why I never stated assumptions about
    the quality of the glyphs, because these assumptions would not be as relevant
    as those made by other forum members. I should have made that more clear, I think:
    because <em>many of you seem to assume that I attribute some special quality to
    these glyphs that could have not come about in a traditional way, which I do not</em>.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    I also do not think this way of working shows a revelatory new approach to education
    in type design. At what point did I make that assertion? My educational advice
    to help out on a project like OpenBaskerville is not the advice I would give to
    a student who wants to learn how to design a typeface. In that case, I would probably
    be more lazy, and suggest to go and ask [[Frank E. Blokland|Frank]], [[Erik van
    Blokland|Erik]], [[Just van Rossum|Just]] or [[Peter Verheul|Peter]] about that.\r\n\r\n<em>What
    I think @Klepas, @Rob and me are primarily interested in, is the way in which
    certain practices first found in the Open Source movement, can inform the traditional
    practice of individual cultural production; which has more to do with communication
    between people, than it has to with letterforms.</em>\r\n\r\nBut just for the
    record, of course I see the importance of quality letterforms in any type related
    project. For the other record, I will try and refute @Jens\u2019 reasoning in
    a subsequent comment.\r\n\r\nBut with regards to the letterforms: I did not focus
    on the quality of the glyphs because I am neither drawing them, nor do I have
    any special expertise on this matter. But @Rob did notice, and he did take it
    seriously. Within an hour after @Jens\u2018 comments, the following commits appeared
    in the project tree:\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><em>Feb 28 05:44:30 2009</em></dt>\r\n<dd>\xDF

    these are some of the points I find exciting:\r\n\r\n<em>Digital collaboration
    has enabled me to discuss the area where my very specific interests converged
    with the very specific interests of others, right here on this thread</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    kind of exchange this forum facilitates, as inherently linked to recent technological
    development. And although it is not tagged as Open Source, it does possess a lot
    of qualities that can be attributed to Open Source, and for much the same reasons.\r\n\r\n<em>Why
    these enhancements work, is not so much because of a striking new model for communication,
    but because of the way it greatly widens the scope of our traditional analogue
    ways of working together.</em>\r\n\r\nMy collaboration with @Rob is pretty traditional,
    in the sense that we met in real life, we meet in real life, and we employ the
    time-tested social model of tutor and pupil.** At the same time, in our seperate
    ways we are both contributing to a project of @Klepas, who lives in Australia.
    The most striking thing is, IMHO, that before @Klepas\u2019 post above, I had
    never had any contact with him, either digital or analog, yet I have been able
    to contribute to his project to the extent that he just publicly thanked me for
    it. Now, If @Klepas would have also lived a 10 minute walk away, we would probably
    have met in real life, and chances are a similar collaboration would have come
    about. It is the fact the doesn\u2019t, but that new technology makes us work
    together like he does, that is exciting.\r\n\r\n<em>The traditional top-down model
    of the author does not hold as a frame of reference for these kinds of practices</em>\r\n\r\nTo
    react to two points in your last comment: <cite>I think that there is still one
    big unresolved problem: the letters that Jens points out are not good enough for
    this typeface. Where in your process is the voice that makes that decision and
    tells the \u2019author\u2019 that?</cite>.\r\n\r\nThat is the whole point I was
    trying to make about the relevance of <em>distributed</em> authorship (which @Klepas
    also pointed at in his lasts comments). Distributed authorship makes sure that
    nobody who knows what he is doing can be ignored. If you or @Jens or @Merkri feel
    there are obvious flaws in the font, it is trivial to make your own fork, and
    fix the flaws in the way you see fit (trivial in a social and conceptual way,
    not yet in a technological way, but IMHO the latter is also bound to happen).
    \r\n\r\nIn a distributed model anyone has a full version of the repository, and
    at that point you have cloned your own you are just as much the \u2018Author\u2019
    of the project as the maintainer of the original repository. \r\n\r\nIn a distributed
    model, you can just clone a project and start tinkering away, and let the question
    whether you would like to contribute back to the originating project be one of
    later concern. In fact, if your modifications are good enough, at some point the
    originating project will start pulling from you!\r\n\r\nI agree with @Klepas\u2019
    statement: <cite>I believe the right to call the shots comes through respect;</cite>
    and <cite>I would gladly pass along any sense of ownership to another who is more
    respected and able-bodied</cite>.\r\n\r\nIn a distributed model, it is not as
    much the notion of the author that is being contested, it is the notion of ownership.
    Because in each fork of the project, the maintainer is the Tzar, and has all the
    opportunity to make the project confirm to his unique vision. \r\n\r\nSo the way
    this works: as long as we respect the Tzar we will listen to him. But when we
    do not respect the Tzar any longer, we do not kill him, we just clone his palace
    and start redecorating! That is why I feel any critique on the typeface at this
    point is not very relevant: we are evaluating a model where nobody is stopping
    you from jumping in, and creating your own version that exemplifies your critique
    in a solid way: letters.\r\n\r\n**Just to make that clear, @Rob does not study
    type design, he studies graphic design. And he is not directly one of my students
    in the sense that he partakes in my classes, rather I coach his Individual Study
    Trajectory which is a part of the curriculum every student has to fill with self-initiated
    projects.\r\n\r\nEric\r\n__\r\n[[http://authoritism.ericschrijver.nl|art directing
    the internet in 2009]]\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>PS why this time really \u2018nobody is
    stopping you from jumping in\u2019.</em>\r\n\r\nNow that is something FOSS has
    been clamouring all along, but IMHO it is only when project ownership becomes
    distributed, that the open source development process starts to get relevant for
    cultural production. Because a traditional open source software development process
    is built around a package that should meet the needs and tastes of a certain community.\r\n\r\nIMHO,
    for cultural producers looking to get involved, this approach has two drawbacks.
    The first one has most widely been noted here, with most of us convinced of the
    need for individual vision.\r\n\r\nThe second one is less apparent, but equally
    valid: because projects are so closely tied to communities, it becomes very hard
    for an outsider to make his voice heard. In the first place, because you have
    to adapt to the communication processes of that community. That can be hard enough:
    how are you going to \u2018seek help in an IRC channel\u2019 if you do not know
    what an IRC channel is? But more importantly, your chances of being listened to
    are inversely related to the extent to which you share the frame of reference
    of that community. The approach stimulates the banding together of peer groups,
    which they should not need to do since they are peers already anyway. Any banding
    together will just stimulate their drive for consensus, and take away from their
    drive for creative, intellectual or conceptual curiosity."

    my \"do something original instead\":\r\n\r\nI'm far more involved in the technical

    at a foundry and getting to see tons of typefaces certainly helps :) ...\r\n\r\nFrom
    my own experience I think it's easier for a beginner not to work on someone else's
    design, because if a beginner is good he will know his limits and work inside
    them. If he works on somebody else's design, and no detailed specs to follow exists,
    he can never be sure to miss some parameter or decision made by the original designer
    that may be obvious to someone more experienced.\r\n\r\nThat's why I think it's

    is not what I call coming strait to the point. That was a vitriolic expression
    of revulsion. It wasn't logical nor was it intended to be logic. Just like Zara,
    you twist a man's words and smear his reputation with a personal attack:\r\n\r\n<em>You
    are all wrong. Nobody understands me. I have a large penis. Please take me more
    seriously.</em>\r\n\r\nThis is an ad hominem personal attack and hitting below
    the belt. An ad hominem argument \"against the man\" is a logical fallacy and
    not a valid argument. Try again, using reason backed up with knowledge gained
    from experience, and you mite just get somehere.\r\n\r\nThank you for your ad
    hominem personal attack. You just made me one thousand times stronger and made
    yourself look bad.\r\n\r\n<em>The problem is not that I am not capable of your
    way of reasoning.</em>\r\n\r\nIf you say so. Except that you're quite wrong. I
    think the problem is you are out of your depth and very full of yourself.\r\n\r\n@Nick:
    <em>It\u2019s a power play. You\u2019re not really interested in typefaces at
    all.</em>\r\n\r\nPrecisely. More than one person here can see thru the charade.\r\n\r\nj

  body: "@Zara: <em>How are your posts any different?</em>\r\n\r\nDon't come at me
    with that kind of pernicious nonsense. As usual you have failed completely in
    your duty of care as a moderator. You should have flagged my vitriolic response
    to Eric as vitriol and extracted and apology from me, but instead you used smear
    tactics.\r\n\r\nDo a word count of his posts versus mine and then you can believe
    your eyes when you compare both our posts and the word count stats.\r\n\r\nThe
    politics going on here are very clear to the outside world. In the world outside
    Typophile, Typophiles have one of the worst reputations known to the internet.\r\n\r\nI
    am currently interviewing an applicant for the position of publicist for Alt Indie
    Typo. The applicant has this to say about Typophile:\r\n\r\n\"I've grown to be
    pretty tough skinned in my professional forays as I\r\nhave developed enough experience
    and ability to justify my creative\r\ndecisions within the fields I have chosen.\"\r\n\r\n\"That
    said, Typophile petrifies me.\"\r\n\r\n\"After having read the vitriolic and scathing
    attacks on people at\r\nTypophile, I am now thinking that it might have more sociable
    to have\r\nbeen a peg-legged pirate with a personal vendetta from the King of\r\nEngland
    on his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Typophile is far more brutal than those ultimate fighting
    championships\r\nseen on television.\"\r\n\r\nEric, to make my view of you and
    this thread and the shit that goes on at Typophile very clear, you're not fooling
    anybody except yourself and the guileless fools pandering to your nonsense.\r\n\r\nAnybody
    who wants to challenge what I am saying this time around had best avoid personally
    attacking me and each other. Only rational arguments about the topic of discussion
    based on fact and knowledge gained from practical experience with type design
    and fonts are acceptable.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    is an argument against what Zara said, not an argument against Zara as a person.\r\n\r\nNonetheless
    her performance as the moderator on this thread and Dan Reynolds' (another of
    Tyophile's mods) complete non-performance as a moderator justify making arguments
    against their skills as moderators. They failed completely to deal with the incivility

    their skills and performance as moderators. I make no argument against them as
    peeple.\r\n\r\nHaving finally read some of the text on Eric's personal website
    I can see now why I expressed revulsion towards him as a person. A person who
    declares himself art director of the internet for the year of 2009 seems most
    unrealistic in his outlook and goals. Lots of stuff about benevolent dictators.
    This is amusing and I walk away from this thread knowing that such a person could
    not possibly harm my reputation, for who on this earth is going to take him seriously?\r\n\r\nHello,

  body: "@sii: Hey, it was only that one time, and... oh, you said Yankees fan. I
    don't really follow sports, good thing that.\r\n\r\nGenerally I find typophile
    to be one of the <em>better</em> places on the Internet. For one, Godwin's law
    seems suspended here. With few exceptions, every time Hitler or the Nazis comes
    up, what follows is an entirely civil discussion of blackletter, to what extent
    Futura was\r\n\r\nHaving risked Godwinning this thread myself, I also want to
    contribute to the substantive issues (while carefully avoiding vitriol and trolling).
    I personally think that copying old, well-done fonts can be a good educational
    experience. I think of it as being fairly analogous to copying old masters, which
    is, from what I can tell, still a fairly respected method in art instruction.\r\n\r\nI
    feel like I learned a lot about the technical aspects of letters from my tracings
    of old alphabets. My early stuff (LeBe) wasn't that good, but, with practice I
    got better at it. I'd hold up my <a href=\"http://levien.com/type/myfonts/pr-Baskerville-Italic.pdf\">Baskerville
    Italic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.levien.com/type/zeno.pdf\">Zeno</a> tracings
    as among the most accurate ever made from metal type (warning: the latter file
    has some bogus hinting, which makes the baseline ragged; print to appreciate properly).
    Not to mention, I learned a lot about optical scaling, which almost all metal
    type gets right and very little digital. That experience with tracing has given
    me a lot more confidence doing my own original designs.\r\n\r\nI think the letter
    grade idea that Nick suggested has potential, but it depends on good teachers
    willing to participate. If that looks at all like Typophile's critique boards,
    it could be a rousing success. I'm amazed to see the way a typeface gradually
    evolves and becomes more beautiful as the designer subjects it to critique and
    refines it - the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/50618\">Cursive Flavored
    Sans</a> is a striking example, imho.\r\n\r\nThere is a community, and it is here.
    I hope acrimonious discussions like this thread don't poison things, especially
    for F/OSS projects. It certainly has helped remind me of why not taking on building
    a collaborative design forum myself was a good idea.\r\n"
