  the Typophile Map!&#34; at the right of the board. I think someone should put a
  notice before clicking, such as &#34;Warning! To use this map you&#39;ll be prompted
  for your email address. This is not a Typophile service, therefore your address
  will be held by who-knows from now on. You may guess what the use.&#34;
