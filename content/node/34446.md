    Helium</a>, at least in the shape of the counters, but I can see the details are
    wrong.  Also thought about squooshed <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-quorum/\">Quorum</a>,
    but that also has wrong details of letterforms.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I'd like to bump this back up in the list. It's driving me crazy, because
    I think it looks very familiar, like an early 20th century typeface. Is anyone
    else getting any vibes about this one?\r\n\r\nLeroy, can you tell us anything
    more about the age or origin of this sample?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I've been browsing through Mac McGrew's book of American Metal Typefaces
    and found that Stymie Light Condensed (p. 296) has an alternate 'a' and 'y' that
    are fairly similar to this sample, and also has an 'r' with an arched arm, like
    this. The counters, however, seem more oval than the oblong style of this sample.\r\n\r\n

  body: "I recognize this one, but I can't come up with a name.\r\n\r\nThe posted
    image looks fuzzy, but I think this is actually a bitmapped font -- which would
    explain why you can't find it in your books, Mike."

  body: "On your tip I just went and looked through about 400 bitmap fonts, and I
    have to say I don't think I saw anything that looked nearly as smooth on the diagonal
    lines, or the curves, as the sample. I doubt this is a bitmap font.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: Always mention where your sample comes from, Leroy... ;^) I hope you realise
    what kind of effort Mike put into finding this font while we could've known what
    it was straight away. Bit of a waste of energy.
