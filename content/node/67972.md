body: "I recently received the list of TDC2 winners, to help me prepare my FontFeed
  posts in time. Don't ask me anything, I am bound by professional secrecy.\r\n\r\nAlthough
  there is some really great stuff in there, on the whole I am not entirely happy
  with the results. This made me wonder if this simply was a somewhat leaner year,
  or if maybe the jury overlooked some worthy submissions (in my not-so-humble opinion).\r\n\r\nOf
  course I can only tell if I also know which submissions didn't receive a Certificate
  of Excellence in Type Design. So if you entered this year's TDC2 type design contest
  please e-mail me, and if there is no sample of your typeface available online please
  include a PDF or image or whatever.\r\n\r\nThank you all for your co-operation.
  I hope I can turn this into an interesting post."

    ATypI E-mail List. Don't worry, I am not planning to stir up a sh!t storm or anything;
    I just need some context.\r\n\r\nYou can e-mail me at my first name (yves) at
