  body: As you said, painted so not-a-font. Can't say it could considered as close
    but you may like some of the digitizations of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/de+vinne|De
    Vinne]] (Grand Central, Denver, Romana, Publication...). May having a look to
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Nicks_Fonts|Nick Curtis]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Jeff_Levine|Jeff
    Levine]]'s collections, they have both digitized many signage letterings.
