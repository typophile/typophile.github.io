  tried to identify it visually and has come back looking very similar to Miller Display
  Roman & EF Century Expanded Volume but the lower case t  and a few other letters
  come back slightly different.\r\n\r\nAlso the ? is  quite interesting as well.\r\n\r\nAny
  help to identify this would be greatly appreciated. \r\n"

  body: "Edited:\r\nThis is in the \"Modern\" type design category created by  by
    Giambattista Bodoni of Parma in 1767. It was very popular for book faces in the
    decades around 1840. Does your Karao have a publication date?\r\n\r\nI can't decide
    if this is a Bodoni or a Scotch Roman, an early 19th century modification of Bodoni
    \ first cut by Englishman Richard Austin and cast by the Scottish type-founder
    Alexander Wilson and Son in Glasgow. Also produced by William Miller. In either
    case the type for the Karao is probably from a British Foundry like Stephenson
    Blake. \r\n\r\nThe digital Scotch Romans cut by Monotype on the basis of the Miller
    Scotch Romans http://www.identifont.com/find?font=scotch+roman&q=Go do not include
    a heavy weight that might be a better match for the Karao. There is a heavier
    weight in a modern reinterpretation Escrow Bold http://www.identifont.com/find?font=escrow+text&q=Go\r\n\r\nThe
    Kararo has a _Q_ that differs from the common Bodoni that has a tail that first
    descends vertically. Scotch Romans have a _Q_ like Karao.\r\n\r\nThe Kararo has
    figures [numbers] that are similar to Scotch Roman.\r\n\r\nIn some ways the letters
    are a better fit with some Bodoni's rather than with the Scotch Romans. Most foundries
    of the era produced Bodoni. There were variations in some letters  and the italics
    varied from true italics like the Karao to sloped Romans. The digital Bodonis
    sold to day follow the the re-cuttings for metal type done in the early 20th century.
    Some are a closer match than others.\r\nBauer Bodoni http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bauer-bodoni/
    is a fair match for most of the letters.\r\n\r\nBTW the figures [numbers] of the
    era were not necessarily part of the same font, and were usually sold separately.
    \r\n\r\nThe question mark looks somewhat similar to a Didot http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/didot/\r\n\r\nAll
    things considered, the Karao is probably set in a heavy Scotch Roman, but it could
    be a heavier Bodoni, mixed with Scotch Roman figures and perhaps letters. Printers
    of the era used what was at hand and mixing fonts was not rare.\r\nDon"

    body: Thanks for your help, the book was published in 1815 so your timeline connects
      quite well. I appreciate your thorough answer as well.
