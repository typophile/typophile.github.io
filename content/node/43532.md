    and in what application?

    \r\n\r\nThe above referenced image is just an example.  \r\n\r\nI was having a
    debate with a member in another forum and I was trying to explain to them that
    typically glyphs are done in a manner such as the bottom referenced image, but
    when you use the  vector application (inkscape) it seems to add extra nodes to
    glyphs when they are converted to paths (curves).  He said that the application
    would not include extra nodes and that they glyph already had them.  I said I
    doubt that Frutiger would create a font that had 16 nodes in it to make the letter
    O it is more likely that he would have used 8 nodes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo my question
    is would a designer actually use 16 nodes to make a san serif O or just 8?\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI

  body: "This can happen if the outlines are converted to a TrueType font along the
    way. TrueType does not use the same kinds of curves that are used in PostScript
    fonts and many drawing programs (B\xE9zier curves). TrueType uses quadratic curves.
    When these are converted back to B\xE9zier curves, you end up with more nodes."

  body: "Also, some designers don't always use what might be perceived to be the \"minimum
    nodes\" way of working. There are cases where a curve won't flow smoothly enough
    without adding a couple more points. This is hard to see and explain since the
    difference is quite subtle, perhaps even in-perceivable to a lay-person. Type
    designers are a perfectionistic bunch though so a minute change will seem imperative
    to them.\r\n\r\n ChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: the upper drawing has some points which seem
    illogical though."

    was a TrueType font.
