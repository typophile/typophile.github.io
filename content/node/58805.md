    \ Some of these letters, like the 't' look like Goudy, but others could be from
    anywhere. This looks like a composite font, perhaps. The 'e' and 'w' are very
    bizarre for a lower case Roman.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    the designer just styled it character-by-character, using 4 (or more) different
