  suitable for people with Dyslexia, <a href=\"http://opendyslexic.org\">OpenDyslexic</a>.
  I began to wonder about the experience of Hebrew readers with Dyselxia. What is
  the best font? What is the worst font? \r\n\r\nIf there are no good fonts yet designed
  for Hebrew readers, this would seem to me a great challenge whereby Hebrew typographers
  could collaborate with one another and with the larger community in designing a
  better font. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL_font_exception\">GPL+Font
  Exception</a> seems like the right license to facilitate such collaboration.\r\n\r\nI'd
  love to learn what anyone knows about Dyslexia and Hebrew reading.\r\n\r\n\r\nAharon

    there is an emphasis on the lower part of each latin letter I wonder of this\r\nis
    a necessary feature for it to be effective? In Hebrew there is a tendency to emphasise
    the upper part of the letter.  In Hebrew instead of a baseline, the letters hang
    downwards from a line though the top of the text.\r\nMike"

  body: "Having worked w/a dyslexic bat mitzvah student, I found, with patience he
    was able to get through a 2 book series by ARE Publishing (which I can't find
    right now, & don't quite recall the name). It was, however, by a speech & language
    specialist. I was much encouraged, but realizing he could only handle chatimot
    (which was fine by our Rabbi), still realized it would need to be enlarged. Still,
    we kept encountering problems. I had expected him to do better, but although he
    actually reads a lot for someone who is dyslexic, there really wasn't much progress.
    So, I went back to transliteration for him, but since I was typing it myself,
    decided to add a few extra spaces between words.  At some point I realized that
    that was why he managed the Hebrew readers\u2014they were columns of centered
    words with plenty of space between the words. I added probably          eight
    \         to         ten           spaces between the words, and later saw some
    research stating that it was the space between the words horizontally that made
    it easier for dyslexics to read, not the vertical space. Colour coding was also
    helpful. I would break the Hebrew into phrases in any such siddur, much as Mishkan
    Tefillah has done (except for central prayers like their V'Ahavta & Tefillah\u2014a
    big mistake for struggling readers)."

  body: "Claire, would you be able to share any visual examples of the text you prepared?
    I would be intrigued to see examples of both the spacing (admittedly much easier
    to conceptualise) and the colour coding, particularly intrigued about whether
    there was a range of contrast (minimal vs. extreme) that you found more productive.\r\n\r\nWhile
    not specifically related to Hebrew I think it is worth referencing the earlier
    Typophile discussion about [[OpenDyslexic font|the Open Dyslexic font]]. I would
    like to think that terrible design is not a solution and the lack of evidence
    in support of it would seem to support that."

    \            you,             A-----            creator          of          lights.
    \  \r\nOr, in transliteration, it might have evolved to:\r\nBa-ruch             a-tah
    \           A-----             yo-tzeir             ha-m-o-rot.\r\n\r\nIn terms
    of colour coding, since I usually take slower readers, I have found it helpful
    to use highlighters on their copies of the service. For example, purple for the
    brachah formula & closing chatimah formula, which also seems to help them understand
    the structure a little better (as well as reducing the text to concentrate on).
    Names are in orange, penultimate accented syllables in pink, congregational responses
    in yellow, kamatz katan in yellow as a reminder of its sound. I might also use
    little red tick marks on words where they might need reminders of syllable divisions,
    as above. Colored sheets of paper visually divide different sections of the service,
    much like the kaddish does. From the responses of my students when they forget
    their books, it seems to help them focus and navigate easier.\r\n\r\nThere is
    also a system of coloured overlays that seem to aid reading abilities of certain
    individuals who have distortions reading text on a white background. There is
    a rather interesting book about this syndrome, Reading By The Colors, by Helen
    Irlen, and further info at irlen.com. "

  body: I am happy I found this interest group. I work as an editor. I read English,
    my native language, effortlessly. I still remember my high school German. But
    although I have been going to Japan for thirty years, and have been regularly
    attending synagogue for almost twenty, I cannot learn Japanese hiragana/katakana
    (not to mention kanji), and I am hopeless at Hebrew. I just realized a few weeks
    ago that I have been confusing the pey sofi and the kaf sofi for decades (in L'cha
    dodi, I have been reading "tof emunei" instead of "toch emunei")! I have been
    wondering if I am dyslexic in non-Western fonts. It would be interesting to see
    if there are fonts in the two languages designed for dyslexics.

  body: "Libby, if you are just decoding Hebrew to pronounce prayers without understanding
    it as a language, which is the case for most American Jews, then I think \"reading\"
    is a fundamentally different problem. Also in Hebrew you have the Nikud, the vowel
    pointing, which makes the decoding process still more difficult. If you have meaningful
    language to connect symbols to then I think the process is easier. The symbols
    to words to sound and meaning is much more motivating than just decoding to sounds.
    Do you know any Japanese as a spoken language? If not then you would be in a similar
    position relative to Japanese. \r\n\r\nAn expert on learning a second language
    told me that at some point the brain sets up a separate center for the language;
    before that you will e.g. mix up different foreign languages. I think getting
    the whole process to function is a problem when you don't have any of the language
    as a spoken language.  "

    I don''t know if the architecture tends to be the same for those who grew up with
    many languages. My wife also grew up with four languages, and slides between them
    effortlessly and automatically depending on the need. With her I am always impressed
    that if there is not the exact phrase in English, but is in another of her languages,
    she will just stick that phrase in the middle of a sentence, without any apparent
    effort.  So you might be right that there is a different architecture at work.
    That she expects me to understand is another story :) '

    but not all of them. I can recognize only a few words on sight, like "leolam va''ed"
    and "shalom"; the rest I have to "sound out" letter by letter. I took a course
    in Biblical Hebrew and was able to do the coursework, but looking at my notes
    months later I couldn''t recognize anything. Similarly, I have a lot of workbooks
    and textbooks for Japanese, and before a trip I can read the hiragana and katakana
    pretty well. The last time I traveled there I was able to take along a furigana
    dictionary (which assumes knowledge of the two syllabic alphabets), but the learning
    never sticks for long. This is despite the fact that I can speak some Japanese
    (not enough!), and my listening comprehension clearly improves over my usually
    two-week stays there, even though everybody wants to practice their English with
    me. I do nothing to keep up my German, but I remember it anyway! '
