  interesting. The article in full follows the link.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/25/reasonableagreemento.html\r\n\r\nWelcome
  to ReasonableAgreement.org -- where we make mincemeat of End User License Agreements.
  As you move through space, as you look at the Web, when you buy things, when you
  travel, it's increasingly the case that you end up making \"agreements\" to give
  up your rights. For example, by installing software, you might give up the right
  to sue the company that made it if it didn't work. Or by subscribing to an online
  music service, you might give up your right to loan the songs you buy to a friend.
  When you install a game like World of Warcraft, you agree to install spyware on
  your computer. When you sign your credit-card slip at Best Buy or Fry's, you waive
  all kinds of rights you get under consumer protection law.\r\n\r\nWho knows if this
  stuff is enforceable? The case law is all over the place. What if you're under-age?
  Drunk? Using someone else's computer -- do you agree on your parents' behalf when
  you install software at their place over the holidays?\r\n\r\nFrankly, it's all
  bullshit. The way the system should work is, you buy something, you own it. The
  law of the land governs your interactions with the seller. What's the point of having
  a consumer-protection law if all it takes to get around it is to announce that you've
  agreed to waive your rights by buying something? If consumer protection laws don't
  protect people who buy stuff, whom do they protect?\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that
  we can't have reasonable agreements -- like when you and your boss sit down and
  draw up your employment contract, negotiating the terms on which you'll work. But
  the idea that an agreement can be made by shouting, \"By standing there doing nothing,
  you agree to let me stab you in the eye!\" is just dumb.\r\n\r\nEnter the anti-EULA.
  Here's the text of it:\r\n\r\nREAD CAREFULLY. By [accepting this material|accepting
  this payment|accepting this business-card|viewing this t-shirt|reading this sticker]
  you agree, on behalf of your employer, to release me from all obligations and waivers
  arising from any and all NON-NEGOTIATED agreements, licenses, terms-of-service,
  shrinkwrap, clickwrap, browsewrap, confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-compete
  and acceptable use policies (\"BOGUS AGREEMENTS\") that I have entered into with
  your employer, its partners, licensors, agents and assigns, in perpetuity, without
  prejudice to my ongoing rights and privileges. You further represent that you have
  the authority to release me from any BOGUS AGREEMENTS on behalf of your employer. "

    \r\n\r\n\"The way the system should work is, you buy something, you own it.\"
    \r\n\r\nBut in most cases font EULAs don't take anything away from this, they
    add rights you wouldn't normally get if you purchased a CD or a book - for example
    the right to distribute an infinite number of copies of the font, providing they
    are embedded in a document file or PDF, the right to modify the font and commercially
    exploit that modified font, the right to make five copies and install them on
    different devices, the right to download the font to a laser printer to improve
    printing performace, the right to use the font as the basis of a logo for a billion
    dollar corporation, etc., etc.,"

    All those things wouldn't need to be mentioned, because the product (font in this
    case) is yours, and yours to do what you want with ? A EULA would basically cease
    being usefull.

    designer who wants to obey the EULA but feels like my hands are frequently tied,
    hired by clients who don't have deep corporate clients, I find myself all too
    often in EULA violation. While I understand and respect intellectual property
    rights I do feel like the EULAs don't really serve the End User much at all."

    are two different issues.\r\nFor the first, many foundries (such as mine) allow
    embedding in pdfs. So you should use their fonts.\r\nFor the second, if your client
    wants to do typesetting using a non-bundled font that you spec, s/he should licence
    it as well. Sure, you may balk at having to use common fonts, but the difficulty
    is with you or your client, not the foundry."

  body: "I feel for this situation. It seems to me the anti-EULA is similar to what
    you get at the corner used car lot. You bought it, you break it, you fix it...if
    you follow me. When I license type I appreciate things such as being able to ask
    for fixes if I find a problem (this happened recently and I had a fixed version
    of the font within 1 day). \r\n\r\nWhat Patty says is true, I wish there was more
    middle ground. However, for the most part, I think we are in middle ground. Sure,
    there are foundries that seem to ask the impossible, but just don't license from
    them. "

    I'll agree that the client should buy their own license if they intend to continue
    to use the font (hard to enforce I know) I feel that it's excessive have to purchase
    an additional license in order to send the font to a printer along with a specific
    job.\r\n\r\nAs I've said before, overly restrictive EULAs IMHO just encourage
    piracy. Or discourage designers from purchasing fonts, which serves no one.\r\n\r\nThe
    fact is that there will always be people trying to get around the rules no matter
    how loose or tight they are. I'm sure most of the users of this forum have, at
    some time, used a font they didn't license. There will always be clients who balk
    at an additional fee (which is why I build it in beforehand). But for most of
    us, it seems there should be a set of rules that are simple, clear, fair, and
    mutually beneficial to the designer and the foundry."

    most of the developers will sell you one for $25,000 or so for a nice family (size
    negotiable). You can do whatever you want with it after you buy it.\r\n\r\nCan't
    afford that? Well maybe you would like to license one instead. There are a few
    limitations in that case ... "

  body: "From both sides of the aisle, I feel a EULA should allow for a job to be
    printed by the client. (I don't mean any printimng of any thing using that font.
    I mean the job the designer sent them.)\r\nEmbedding a font in a PDF for the purpose
    of sending it to your client or offset printer is the best solution and should
    always be allowed without an extra fee. What the client bought from the designer
    was that document and they should be able to print it. If they choose to make
    a new document ontheir own inhouse, then they should license their own copy. Embedding
    is far more preferable to me than sending a copy of the font to the printing firm
    along with the InD files.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Yes Chris but sometimes the client/printer want the original native files
    in case there are problems or last minute changes. I always tell them that they
    are not allowed to keep the fonts after the job is completed but who knows what
    they do. Some of my clients have a policy to license the fonts themselves, some
    don't. Budgets are small in publishing.

    I have for buying a home in 'sub-division', condo, etc. You buy a house then you
    are forced to pay a monthly Home Owners Association (HOA)- for what- a mowed lawn?\r\n\r\nI
    challenge any foundry to tell me how often a 'joe-blow' kinda guy buys a one-time
    license for sending PDF to a friend or co-worker. \r\n\r\nAs in: \"Hey font company
    guy, yah its me again, I need another license, because when I used that first
    license to send my resume to my homegurl- (she's like smart 'n stuff with the
    graphics)- she said it kinda sucks and I needed to change some stuff around again,
    so heres another $12 or $19 bucks\" (MIMBO version)\r\n\r\nNOT!!!\r\n\r\nI think
    the PDF fee is mainly targeted at the corporate, periodical, publishing users.
    They can afford to pay those fees and (maybe) if I was a type designer I would
    justify it because of the large scale of transmissions. But really, small frys
    like myself cannot be the target user. I just can't see it. Most EULA's don't
    make that distinction between big guys and you and me. If they did this topic
    would not exist.\r\nSo when I see that clause in the license (WINK WINK) I know
    who there really talking to!\r\n\r\nHere are some things I will and will not do.\r\n\r\n1.
    I never ever lend fonts.\r\n2. I don't steal fonts, or mp3's for that matter.\r\n3.
    But If I had a laptop I would put it on the laptop even if the EULA said only
    one machine- but not many foundries do. \r\n4. Fonts from old computers I take
    to the new computer as in all cheesy win 3.1 fonts from  my i386, I have copy
    on my mac- WIDE LATIN ANYONE?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the words of Judge Hatchett: \"Don't

    (enforceable). By this I don't mean to deprive anyone of the fruit of their labour.
    I am simply saying that the rights of providers and consumers are determined by
    the entirety of the legal system, of which the EULA is only a part. Mystical reverence
    of the EULA is naive and inappropriate.\r\n\r\nI also object to the term piracy
    and similar terms invented by pharmas, motion picture associations etc. These
    terms serve only to delegitimize a healthy debate surrounding the scope of the
    rights in intellectual property. The society that created IP rights has the right
    to define them. Just because someone has an economic interest does not mean they
    have a legal right.\r\n\r\nBest,"
