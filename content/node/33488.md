body: "Our firm (an interpretive exhibits design/fab company) is redesigning our identity
  system, and since I'm the resident typophile I came up with this for our logotype.
  Or would it be called a wordmark? Anyway, It's set in Legacy Sans Ultra, but with
  modifications -- obviously the R (which I thought was a little too leggy), but more
  subtle changes to O and the width of the glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe jpeg shows before and
  after. The PDF is for anyone who wants to zoom in close and point out flaws that
  I should fix before we commit to using it. Any comments and suggestions for improvement
  would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FORMATIONS_logo_6334.jpg]"

  body: The leg of your modified _R_ seems too be lacking in weight compared to the
    weight of other down strokes.

  body: "I would agree that the new R is a little too light. Overall I like the typeface,
    and the spacing you've chosen.\r\nI don't know much about your biz, but it seems
    to me that this logo may be a little too customary. Have you thought about implying
    some subtle motion or progress, perhaps by setting the type on a curve, or distorting
    the characters. After all, the name is formations...but I don't see anything being
    formed.\r\n\r\nSee this link: http://delaneygroup.com/quilt/about.html\r\n\r\nThey've
    got a great logo.\r\n\r\nPlease do me a favor...I need some critique too - mine's
    posted in the forum.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    body: We're keeping the logo simple but in most applications it will be accompanied
      by various full-color textures which relate to the type of projects we do (educational
      museums, natural history, cultural history, visitor centers etc).
