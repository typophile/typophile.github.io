  never seen anything like this anywhere else.\r\n\r\nP\xC4\xC4-KAUPUNGISSA (nowadays

  this to avoid repeating the word kuussa\r\nTouko-kuussa\r\nKes\xE4-kuussa\r\n\r\nWas
  this the way to deal with hyphens in 1830's, or is this an odd one out?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alexandra_5628.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/keisarinnan_kivi_3712.jpg]"

    Danish, I can understand why they wanted to avoid repeating the word <em>kuussa</em>,
    though."

  body: "Well, not <em>kuussa</em> per se; but <em>kusse</em> (which any Dane will
    immediately think of when seeing the word) is the Danish equivalent of <i>vittu</i>,
    except coarser.\r\n\r\nSo probably yes."

    charged per character, and they already had back luck with the year. Three triples
    in Roman numerals, that\u2019s unfortunate. ;-)"
