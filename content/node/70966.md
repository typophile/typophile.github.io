  in the font menues (in word) the .notdef character is displayed a couple of times
  AFTER the fontname.\r\n\r\nFor instance it looks like this if I hade the bullet
  as notdef.\r\n\r\nMyfont Regular \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\r\nAnyone
  knows why?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Does this happen with the one font only?\r\n\r\nIf I had such a question,
    I would open the font in FontLab, copy the outlines to the mask, delete the mask,
    delete the kerning and generate the font. (Or I would destroy the outline with
    an effect filter.) Then I would check, if the problem still is there. If yes,
    I would post the font file here. It is much easier to detect problems with a font,
    if you have the font. I don\u2019t have Office installed, but for sure other member,
    maybe even the same version as you. And sometimes it is not necessary to have
    the same program installed, if you want to make out, where the problem is."

    not sure, what you mean. Do you mean my description about that, what I would do?
    The reason is, that we cannot post original commercial fonts here. But if the
    glyphs are destroyed and if the kerning is removed, the font is unusable. Probably
    a misunderstanding."
