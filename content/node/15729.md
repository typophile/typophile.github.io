    best use of space for something to be viewed on screen it is distinctive. My slight
    criticisms are that you should probably make more of your contact details (turn
    them the right way round and the title of Metamorphoses) on your portfolio and
    include them on the website.\r\nTim"

  body: "While I understand completely your reluctance to work with HTML, it seems
    to me you're missing an opportunity. Book design is all details work, each book
    brining with it a variety of challenges and leaps of understated risk, and so
    is web work. Every project has limitations: small budget, letterpress and so few
    type choices, stock, binding, etc. Same with web. And it seems to me you're cheating
    a bit. If you're going to go online, you should either produce or have produced
    for you something that speaks to your work and abilities. I guess what I'm saying
    is that an attempt to make HTML work seems important. One big graphic sliced up
    with a couple of links tacked on ain't no web page, and a glance at your code
    proves it. I don't mean to be a jerk here, but extending the edges of your graphic
    (for example) isn't really the issue. The issue (in this case) is integrating
    your graphic into the web page so that there is no distinction between the graphic
    and the background, regardless of how big or hi-res the viewer's monitor is. That
    same issue, I think, extends to the site as a whole.\r\n\r\nAll that aside, you've
    got some great work in the portfolio. I just think the site should reflect and
    exemplify that work, not just provide a link to it."

    body: I understand what you're saying, and its exactly what was keeping me away
      from html in the first place. I knew how to code in college (I went to design
      school at the height of internet fervor, when it seemed we were taken on weekly
      field trips to the offices of Razorfish to see what we were working towards--ahem)
      but I hated every minute of it and promptly forgot it. Its just not for me.
      I can't afford to hire a web designer who knows how to code. I know that a glance
      at my code (and by the way, how dare you!) makes me seem an incompetent web
      designer. I don't want to be hired to do web design anyway. Maybe the issue
      is that a web portfolio for a book designer is just a bad idea if it will turn
      people off. I had been sneaking my business cards into the books I designed
      at bookstores as a means of self promotion but I decided that lacked a certain
      amount of tact. But please explain further how I've cheated, and how what I've
      cobbled together isn't, in fact, a web page. Do you have to be a master to play
      the game?

  body: I agree with jason - there is no reason you cannot offer the info both ways.
    Of course the PDF is higher rez -but  I think folks know this & accept it. The
    Web is not evil - it is limited in some ways but it is stronger in some ways too.
    Not offering the info on web pages too means that cut yourself off from many of
    these important advantages.

  body: "I don't think you have to be a master by any means to get 90% of the benefit
    from a web site. All the razorfish style hoopla aside I think that :\r\n\r\n-
    Contact info is important. If you have just one page you should perhaps put at
    least a phone # on it. The first page of a web site is a little like a business
    card. It aught to meet at least that level of helpfulness.\r\n\r\n- Searchability
    ( google etc) is important. You can do this better via web pages than PDFs even
    if google is PDF friendly to a point. \r\n\r\n- Control is important. The web
    is great because it lets you take ( & offer ) one small small bite of info at
    a time which means that the visitor can control what & when they get their info.
    Certainly better than they can in a PDF. So break up your content into relevant
    parts! \r\n\r\n- Navigation is important. Navigation is the needed complement
    to breaking up content.\r\n\r\n- Speed is important. PDFs are great but they are
    data heavy. Letting someone get a taste of your stuff before you make them get
    the PDF is nicer. Some people will roll their eyes & wonder - 'how big will this
    be?' Speed gives them a taste -  and as nice as your stuff is they will HAVE to
    have your PDF.\r\n\r\nI actually think you could make web pages that are nearly
    identical to your PDF ( visually ) and add in a contact page ( or put that info
    on the 1st page ) and you would be almost golden. The main task would be to design
    the navigation so it doesn't interfere. But this is not impossible. Then the last
    thing would be to deal with your meta tags & descriptions ( different for each
    page ) and you will be quite well off. 90%!\r\n\r\nLastly, I think the *content*
    of your site will quickly make it clear you are not a web designer - so that you
    can have as nice a site as you want without provoking that worry. And if you get
    inquiries you can pass them on to your web designer - no?"

  body: While I know there's a certain disdain, likely warranted, for web design/development,
    I'm always surprised by designers'/typographers' aversion to code. When I was
    first learning HTML, way back in 1997, the only route was to look at others' code
    and stare at it until the patterns emerged, and then to write a whole pile of
    it until something, anything, worked (in at least one browser on one platform,
    for starters). After many, many nights sitting up late and training my fingers
    to hit the angle-bracket keys it started to make sense. That process is the same
    one I go through every time I start a new book project, except instead of staring
    at code, I'm staring at a blank document in InDesign (or a blank sheet of paper).
    Format, text measure, margins, proportion, type size, leading, all of these are
    code, all the points and picas and glyphs; it's a matter of deciphering the blank
    space and finding the code to make it sing. This is what I meant by a missed opportunity.
    You hate code, fine. But in returning to it and grinding out a site, in going
    through that process, you're likely to bring something new to your book work.
    I'm excited these days by these kinds of challenges, even when they suck intensely
    in the moment. I know they're going to pay off, because the process is the payoff.
    All I'm suggesting is that you get away from ImageReady and dive in there. Carve
    out a means of presenting your work on-line by exploring the process of presenting
    your work on-line.

  body: "Sorry for butting in late to the discussion. \r\n\r\nI don't think the original
    design is entirely HTML un-friendly. It even seems to have the navigation built
    into it with the skills listed on the wooden board. \r\n\r\nIf I were to approach
    this, I would set out the content in a very simple HTML document (with no tables!):\r\n\r\n&lt;div
    id=\"content\">\r\n\r\n&lt;h1 id=\"name\">Gary Robbins&lt;/h1>\r\n\r\n&lt;ul id=\"menu\">\r\n&lt;li
    id=\"gd\">&lt;a href-\"#\">Graphic Design&lt;/a>&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li id=\"bd\">&lt;a
    href-\"#\">Book Design&lt;/a>&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li id=\"bb\">&lt;a href-\"#\">Bookbinding&lt;/a>&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;/ul>\r\n\r\n&lt;p
    id=\"dowload\">Please download: &lt;a href-\"#\">Portfolio&lt;/a> &lt;a href-\"#\">Resume&lt;/a>\r\n\r\n&lt;/div>\r\n\r\nThen
    with CSS I would put your image as the background image of the 'content' div and
    position the other elements over the appropriate parts of the image. Then I would
    hide the HTML elements so the links are still in the correct place and Google
    can read it all. Which should bring us back to where we started but with an accessible
    site.\r\n\r\nOh, and I'd center the content div and add a background image to
    fill the white space if that is what was wanted.\r\n\r\nErr, anyway, I've probably
    gone on too much now anyway, I just wanted to point out that the HTML itself can
    be really simple if it isn't muddied with tables.\r\n\r\nI hope that is some help,\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nEd."

    you sure you can not\_afford a web monkey to build it for you? If you supply all
    the design elements and keep the layout simple it could be built in a couple of
    days at minimum cost.\r\n\r\nIf you dare build it yourself\_English designer Daniel

    Parson Products seems like something fun to flip through. I like the 2 books in

    edeverett suggested the list on the board is a very logical point to insert navigation.
    In fact, I thought that was the navigation. I was dissapointed when I found out
    there were no other links. \r\n\r\nI say you should take the idea/presentation
    of your portfolio and translate it to the web. I'd take the wooden background
    and make it the background for your site and learn how to make a div tag in css
    for the description. Even if you just have one sample link/image in each of the
    categories it would be better.   \r\n\r\nThat may seem daunting but there are
