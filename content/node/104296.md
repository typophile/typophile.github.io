  for a typeface to be used in a logo for a fragrances/perfume brand.  Not being a
  designer, thought it would be beneficial to provide, as best as I can articulate/sketch,
  a good design brief to the graphic designer who will create the final product.  This
  includes deciding on the typeface before the designer is engaged.\r\n\r\nHoping
  to hear your suggestions for a good looking set of letters that would best represent
  my logo.  Think:  black and capitalized, such as used by many a fashion magazine,
  fashion label, etc.  Don't have a lot of money to pay to a sophisticated type foundry
  so a compromise is necessary, suppose.  Obviously the typeface will be for commercial
  purposes, appropriate licensing at the least cost is desirable.\r\n\r\nSerif / Sans-Serif
  ...  I was originally drawn to a Sans-Serif font such as used in the 'Vanity Fair'
  logo.  Two fonts that I came across were dafont.com/fiesta.font and dafont.com/mouse-deco.font\r\n\r\n....Then
  the 'Barneys New York' logo, feat. serif lettering caught my attention and now I'm
  torn between either a bold/sans-serif font or an elegant/subtle serif font.  Something
  in between perhaps?  <strong>What do you think?</strong>"

  body: "Don't take this the wrong way but you should let the designer do his/her
    job and come up with the best solution that they can. It is nice to have a client
    give examples of what they like but giving specific fonts and such isn't going
    to give a very good or original result. If the designer is ANY good they will
    do research on their own and present variations based on that. You should have
    a good sit-down discussion with your designer and present your data, the target
    audience, any graphic styles you make like, etc... and the designer will take
    this into account to create something you love and something that works well to
    position your brand in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nIf they don't do any research (basically
    what you are trying to do now) then they aren't very good in the first place and
    I'd recommend finding someone a bit more competent."
