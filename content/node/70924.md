  body: "I thought we had tried this one before, but my search of the archive came
    up empty. This is certainly a font, but because it's a hand-printed one, it could
    have been done by anyone with a brush in their hands, and some font software.
    I expect it's custom for the magazine.\r\n\r\nAlternatives: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/seven/\">Linotype
