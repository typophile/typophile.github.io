  body: "Good find Dick.\r\nWe should mention, however, that the maker of this font,
    Deiter Steffmann was very generous in creating and distributing free improved
    versions of fonts that had been digitized by others. I am traveling right now
    so I don't have my research on the creator of the original digital font.\r\nThe
    pre-digital design is an ornate Tuscan typeface from around 1850. The metal type
    is still available, as Skyline 2010 Trocadero from  Schuyler Shipley's Skyline
    Type Foundry  http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-46381.html\r\nA good quality character
    set was reproduced in Hunt Bros. 101 Faces as Plate 65.\r\nA very similar version
    has been digitized by  Michael Hagemann as Saddlery http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/saddlery/
    It has two versions. One has rounded tops and bottoms like Trocadero. The other
    is the same but adds posts on top and bottom. Going from memory, I seem to recall
    that this was Minaret by Herman Ihlenburg 1868. The posts on top and bottom resemble
    minarets. Luc Devroye's page on Hermann Ihlenburg http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-38296.html\r\nDon\r\n"
