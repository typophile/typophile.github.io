    just build it in than keep switching between Photoshop and other apps to paint

    this case, because it's a pretty useful feature for people who do 3D work. \r\n\r\nIt
    would be nice if Adobe would pare Photoshop down some. Maybe have an install option

    use on the first day of Photoshop 101.\u201C"

  body: 'It is about time Adobe made their software more 3D capable, though this news
    hardly goes far enough. Macromedia had a bunch of 3D technologies in their portfolio
    that they just let stagnate after they acquired Flash. Anyone think there is a
    chance Adobe might revive them any time soon? Just bundling an updated Extreme
    3D in the CS package would instantly make Adobe a player in 3D graphics. Granted,
    it has a long way to go to bring it up to par with other modern 3D apps, and Adobe
    might not want to invest in that sort of development, '

    to start talking about Illustrator. I mean aren't 3D animated graphics vector
    and polygon based?

  body: Not only 3D animated graphics, but plain old packaging design could benefit
    from it. Most of the templates used for package design come as .EPS vector format,
    but you have to design a 3D box on a 2D plane. Being able to interactively design
    something where the text automatically wraps around the box would be awesome.
