  about in a new magazine about design for the danish design community. The article
  will feature in dual language (danish-english)! The tricks is that the font might
  even be the main font for the whole magazine... \r\n\r\nSo I like to hear from you
  guys. Who is the next star on the big sky of fonts!\r\n\r\nLove \r\n\r\nMark"

    to say who\u2019s hottest [maybe even impossible]. Some of my current favourites
    are for example <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/designer/lukasz_dziedzic/\">\u0141ukasz
    Dziedzic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/designer/jan_maack/\">Jan
    Maack</a> [he\u2019s from Danmark btw.], but to be honest, my list could be longer
    as well \u2026"

  body: Hey, Paul has the skills to brag... His work IS hot. Plus, if you are on the
    search for good new typeface design, looking at the work of University of Reading
    graduates is a good place to start. I am proud to be part of the group. But you
    needn't limit yourself to the names of the three classes up on that site; all
    of the past decades worth of students are worth a look.
