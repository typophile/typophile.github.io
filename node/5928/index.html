		<div class="commentbody">Zach, (first sorry for butchering your name) isn't it the ultimate goal in communications to convey a message while not even noticing how its presented? A good example was an article in Photoshop User. Bert Monroy is an unbelievable Super Realist Illustrator, but he's a poor writer and the layout for his multipart article was so bad you couldn't figure out what followed each other. There wasn't a clear cut flow to the paragraphs. I wrote to the editor about this and the next issue his second part of his article the paragraphs were numbered so you could easily follow the instructions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I loved House of Leaves. I still think it is one of the best literary works I've ever read. I saw Danielewski's name twice in the end credits of the Derrida documentary (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.deridathemovie.com">www.deridathemovie.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->). But I wonder, do you intend to write all the material and layout the entire zine yourself? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A lot can be observed from Danielewski's approach, who spent 10 years writing House of Leaves before he learned how to use the software and typeset it himself. After all, how well would you be able to understand what he's trying to write after it's been broken up by a hired typesetter who sees only the sentences and paragraphs and where they should start and stop? Or whether the footnotes should run down the margins, or the bottom of the page, or inside a box with a blue border which is continued at the same position for 8 right-facing pages with the mirrored version on the left facing pages before coming to an end at solid black box? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just think it would be too difficult for a zine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For those of you who haven't read this book, I highly recommend it.

I think the two main things I'm trying to get past are: (brace yourself for po-mo scare quotes) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. The idea of linear, &quot;original&quot; texts that we, designers, simply put onto the page in one form or another that has no effect on what &quot;the text&quot; &quot;says&quot; or &quot;means&quot;. That design is purely an interpretive art parasitical on writing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Also, the idea that these texts are simply and only outward expressions of some inner state of the author: that they are self-identical, that they mean one thing and not another, and that the author, if asked, has final say on what the text actually means.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I realize a lot of these ideas are old hat, but it just doesn't seem to me that they have trickled down into affecting the practice of graphic design/typography to a great degree. (Not that I am an expert.) I have had a few humble ideas for how to make intelligent (I hope) use of them, which I will try to post in the morning.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ricardo, thanks for that link &ndash; it would've never occurred to me but you're right.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Talmud example is perhaps a good segue into one class of the ideas I'm toying with: unusual juxtapositions. I am pretty sure that in the Talmud (someone correct me if I'm wrong) the centermost text is the scriptures (exactly which I'm not sure), surrounded by notes/commentary on it (by some ancient authority?), and then notes/commentary on the first layer of commentary (by some less ancient authority?). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One kind of &quot;unusual juxtaposition&quot; would be to take the Talmud idea pretty literally: first write a &quot;core article,&quot; then get someone else (or myself, or myself under pseudonym?) to write running commentary on it, perhaps pro, perhaps con; and then either leave it at that or repeat with a third person. This, I think, would disturb readability hardly at all, especially if the comments were outside of the core article's text box. (Like in the Talmud example.)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Actually, I just remembered, now that I wrote this, a book I read a while ago called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Post-Evangelical<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It's basically a controversial book, for evangelicals at least, that argues for a new phase in evangelicalism. For the American edition they got six or eight well-known evangelical (or Christian at least) thinkers to do running commentary in little text boxes peppered throughout. They cover a fairly wide spectrum, so they develop some interesting conflicts of perspective, both with the author and between each other. So that would be a variation: getting a bunch of people to do one level of commentary, instead of concentric levels. (Sample pages are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> click 'excerpt'.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another variation on this idea would be to replace the core article with something else, such as public domain material like speeches, or copyright-expired (e.g. Dover) stuff. Yet another variation would be replace the direct commentary with quotes, statistics, sidebars, etc., but instead of choosing material that is directly relevant to, and in agreement with, the core text, as one conventionally does, choosing material that undermines it, or just doesn't seem to even be about the same topic. Like how the two texts in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Glas<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are about different things. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Probably these ideas aren't particularly mind-blowing, but I think if done with some thought, you could get some interesting effects, and without the disruption for the reader (or layout fatigue Jesse is alluding to) that the more radical ideas I have might cause.</div>
