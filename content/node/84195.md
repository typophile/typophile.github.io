body: "I've been going through a lot of webcomics, trying to identify the typefaces
  which they use for their lettering.\r\n\r\nOne webcomic seems to have a particularly
  nice typeface for lettering:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lana_sam2_6630.jpg]\r\n\r\nExcept
  that the exclamation mark is not slanted, this reminds me of the lettering of DC
  letterer Mitt Snappin, although there is also some resemblance to that of Marvel's
  Artie Simek. (The typeface, though, is definitely not Comicraft's Chatterbox, which
  closely resembles Artie Simek's lettering.)\r\n\r\nOccasionally, I've noticed some
  imperfections in kerning:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lana_sam1_6177.jpg]\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lana_sam3_6662.jpg]\r\n\r\nTo
  make things as easy as possible, here's a complete alphabet:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lanaalph8_4682.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  comic itself, \"Spying With Lana\", would have to be categorized as NSFW, incidentally."

  body: I've checked the catalogues of Blambot, Comicraft, and the comic fonts from
    Canada Type, as well as the Apostrophic Labs and VTC free comic fonts, but it
    turns out that while I don't see an exact match in the style of the type, but
    that could just be because some features are lost in reduction, the distinctive
    characteristics of the R, the W, the E, and the Q are matched in [[http://www.studiodae.com/whizfont.html|WhizBang]],
    which I had encountered before, so that could be it.

  body: "Actually, looking at the provided specimen of WhizBang, they don't match
    in one very obvious respect: it would at least have to be letterspaced to match
    the word balloon examples shown.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a subtle difference in
    the letter forms: the letter D in WhizBang does not have an overhang on the top
    (the letter P does), unlike the target face."

  body: I asked the creator of the comic which face he used, and it turned out to
    be a budget face from a comic art supply house - BLcomic from Blue Line. They
    no longer sell that font.
