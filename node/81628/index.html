  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Design pages with even color is something I’ve somewhat unconsciencely picked up over time. It is to some extent rooted in metal type and it’s optical sizes, but if I remember correcly I also belive Tschichold had a thing or two to say about the subject.</p>
<p>I rarely have projects where completely even color is ideal, but the principle has stayed with me and is especially apparent in my choices of contrasting fonts in a hierarchy. In fact, this post is mostly about contrast, but contrast viewed in the light of &ldquo;even color&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I had a designer friend ask me to crit his work today. Looking at it I realized he’d never learnt any of this stuff (what do they teach them anyway?), and tried explaining the idea: &ldquo;… contrast needs to be clearly marked, be it by weight, style, emphasis etc. Contrast is applied in a hierarchy, and the hierarchy needs to be consistent, pairing fonts should harmonize, but be clearly different …&rdquo; And so on and so on. However, my oral skills can be likened to that of a sack of rotten potatoes and I’m pretty sure he didn’t understand even a wee bit of what I tried to say.</p>
<p>Getting to the point: Are there any good discussion on the topic here at Typophile, or if not, would you possibly consider voicing your thoughts in this thread?</p>
<p>Btw: I’m talking about typography, not type design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">With all due respect to Typophiles, I think giving your friend a relevant chapter from Bringhurst or some similar book would be more instructive than reading an online thread full of disagreements and fragmented conversations. Especially for the basics. Or maybe Thinking With Type, by Ellen Lupton, which is a fun introduction. (I&rsquo;m not sure how much your friend knows, but if he is trained as a designer, he has likely already read these and similar books. Although I don&rsquo;t actually know &ldquo;what they teach them anyway,&rdquo; as I&rsquo;m self-taught.)</div>
