body: "I'm looking for a good serif for a project with a late 19th century look to
  it (Alternate Gothic and Clarendon bold are also involved). \r\n\r\nI think I'd
  like to use something like Brunel (http://www.christianschwartz.com/brunel.shtml)
  or Benton Modern Display (http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonModernDisplay/).
  \r\n\r\nThe former seems to be in limited release and the latter could work but
  I'd like to know what other similar fonts are out there. I tried to search for information
  on \"English Modern\" (Which is what the designer says Brunel is) but I can't find
  anything. \r\n\r\nI know the moderns like Bodoni, Century and Modern No. 20 but
  I don't think they're right for this. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

    came to mind.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, James Montalbano\u2019s didone, the <a href=\"http://www.terminaldesign.com/Fonts/#/YoAndy\">Yo</a>\u2019s.\r\n\r\nBut
    really, doesn\u2019t every foundry worth its salt publish a didone?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Digging the Yo's  - but no italic? \r\n\r\nIngeborg is great too - I didn't
    even think of that one.\r\n\r\nNick - I'm sure you are correct, I just don't know
    where to look! I was sure there were more cool Didone designs out there with a
    similarity to Brunel (or even Austin in its bolder variants). I'm surprised I
    can't find any old ones aside from Bodoni and Didot. Surely there were many, many
    more kicking around at the end of the 19th century. I guess the revivals are relatively
    recent?  "
