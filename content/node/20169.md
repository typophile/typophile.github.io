body: I'm thinking of buying some kind of Sabon, being fed up with Times New Roman,
  but being a total type noob, I'd like to know what the differences are between the
  different versions available (Monotype/Linotype/whatever). Thanks.

  body: "Yes, Sabon Next is great, and you won't have to see the Sabon italic h. But
    let me ask you this:\r\n\r\n1. What's your budget?\r\n2. What purpose will you
    use Sabon for? To make a shopping list, personal correspondence, or to set a book?\r\n3.
    What software will you use? Will you use InDesign or something similar? If it's
    Word, don't bother - stick with what you have installed. (Someone here recently
    suggested Georgia, and I think it's quite usable at 10.5 pt).\r\n4. Why Sabon?
    It's one of my favourite faces to read, but there are other good text fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs
    for your question, the cuts of Sabon are the same.There may be differences in
    Kerning etc."

      typography, it can certainly be twisted into producing something infinitely
      better than the default, and plenty good enough to justify considering an appropriate
      choice of typeface. Admittedly, you do have to fight against the program to
      get there...\r\n\r\n'myownprivatedisco', if you're not stuck to professional
      workflow requirements and have a technical mindset, you might find (La)TeX a
      very satisfying tool to work with. Plus its free."

    \u2013 Nothing exciting. I don't really have any good reason for buying a font,
    I just thought it would be nice. Just so that when I produce \"things that people
    will read\" it'll look nicer. Possibility of self-publishing a book\r\nSoftware
    \u2013 Well...at the moment, Word... I was considering getting hold of some (more)
    proper GPL typesetting stuff but again I don't know anything about what's good
    and what's not.\r\nWhy Sabon? Because that's what the Faber & Faber poetry collections
    are set in. I think it looks nice.\r\n\r\nI guess the answer is to Just Not Bother,
    then."

  body: Sounds to me like you appreciate good type. If your budget is such that you
    cannot afford Sabon Next you can always start with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=LH.120997.0.0">Linotype
    Sabon</a>. You can buy single styles which does fit within your budget.

    linotype, adobe, and monotype), but something like Quadraat might be trickier
    (because osf is built into the vanilla roman -- not the \"extended\".)\r\n\r\nA
    dear, dear man by the name of Walter Schmidt already provided packages for using
    Aldus, Minion, Optima/Nova, Syntax, Sabon, Adobe and Stempel Garamond, Dolly,
    Frutiger and more. All the user needs to do is to license the font. http://home.vr-web.de/~was/fonts.html\r\n\r\nLyx
    is an excellent way to get into typography, because it allows a Word user to enjoy
    the benefits of a typesetting engine out of the box and without paying. With time,
    a user must learn some LaTex to obtain specific results, but simple documents
    -- letters, articles, books -- can be produced simply by instructing the program
    what to set (e.g., a letter), and choosing the font and size. Latex takes care
    of the rest."

    large sizes. If you're used to a typeface performing a certain way at small sizes,
    you could get a surprise when you use it at small or large sizes. Mr. Phinney,
    care to elaborate? \r\n\r\nFor a good all-purpose text family, try MvB Verdigris.
    Or, get Roman and Italic of Whitman from FontBureau, which is close to your budget. "

    text to 75%, do you want it to then contain 9-point text? Or would you rather
    the text stayed at 12 point (possibly overflowing the frame)?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: 'Thanks for clarifying that preference, Tom. I have played with ID and there
    is some behavior that happens to text, which reminds me of the h-z program or
    some similar algorithm. I''ve set a paragraph of text in a single-master design
    like Bembo or one of my own designs, at about 7 point, then copied the text, without
    changing any atributes except changing point size to about 96 point, and then
    zoomed the 2 samples to the same large size onscreen, and discovered that the
    smaller sample was set looser and horizontally scaled. Same with the large sample;
    tighter spacing, slightly narrow. What is that? I thought that turning off the
    "text attributes while scaling" preference stopped that behavior. It''s a real
    bother when I''m testing and proofing fonts in development. '
