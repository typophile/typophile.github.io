body: "Hi!!\r\nI'm starting to develop my first serif typeface and would like to know
  what you all think of it. \r\nI'm trying to create a interesting rhythm and maybe
  a dynamic look for it.  Not sure if the overall weight is correct. I had a lot of
  trouble getting the s and g right. Hope it looks good.\r\n\r\nPlease critique!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "After a quick look, overall, I like it; I've always had a soft spot for typefaces
    that have a feeling of movement to them. \r\n\r\nGenerally, I feel like the characters
    aren't quite cohesive yet. The h, a, m, b, and o are for the most part smoothly
    curved, with the characteristic pointed stroke endings, but the r, f, t, and g
    (especially the g) have their smoothness interrupted by angled lines. In addition,
    those letters show some asymmetric sections (like the crossbars of the f and t)
    that I don't see on the other letters. I think you need to decide in which direction
    you want to take it -- toward the smooth, Sauna-esque curves of the h and n, or
    toward the rougher shapes of the r and g."

  body: "Much, much better, I think. It seems more like a cohesive unit now.\r\n\r\nIn
    my very non-expert eyes, my main issue is with the \"ball\" ending of some of
    your letters (the top of the a, the loop of the g, the s, etc.). It seems like
    most of your letters make use of the angled ending, so the ball ending seems a
    bit jarring in some cases. It's not too distracting in the a, f, and r, but the
    g and s feel somewhat different from the other letters. I think, again, you have
    to choose whether to add more ball endings to make these less out of place or
    to remove the ball endings altogether.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not crazy about the curved
    attachment between the crossbar of the f and the body; it makes the area where
    they meet too heavy. And finally, the bottom of the v and the shape of the e (especially
    the bottom-right corner of the counter) seem a bit off. Maybe sharpening them
    in line with the other stroke endings could help, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    I really like your effort. As I said previously, it reminds me of Sauna, which
    I'm a fan of. Do you have any other letters to show off yet?"

    for better. I may be looking to much and trying to hard to get this right:-)\r\nThere
    are many thinks that don't look right yet, but anyway, I wanted to show you want
    I've been up to. \r\nYour critique has help me a lot so far. \r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TherezaFull_5183.jpg]"

  body: "I only have a second to respond now; I'll hopefully have time to look harder
    sometime soon. Regarding the capitals, I'm not so sure how well they fit. They
    seem handwritten (although maybe you just haven't refined them yet), which doesn't
    jibe with the soft but precise feel of the lowercase.\r\n\r\nWhile I like some
    of your lowercase tweaks on a character-by-character basis (like the g), overall
    it's quite a different typeface now. I'll have to think if I like that you removed
    a number of the curved stroke endings, as I quite enjoyed them popping up everywhere.
    Weight-wise, the t, q, w, and x seem too heavy."

  body: The top of the new g is tasty! The bottom seems less good maybe the change
    in direction at the top can occur sooner. Maybe the ball at the end can be made
    more like the tops of the f or b. The caps feel too heavy in comparison to the
    lc. The lc is starting to really work so I would modify the caps in favor of the
    lc. That o is a bit less round than I want. I like the feeling in the UC JKXY
    & V!

  body: Also, keep weight consistent. For example, it looks like the thin in your
    K is about the same thickness as the thicks in your B and P. A lot of your stroke
    endings are pretty bland, like the middle bar of the E. I might suggest either
    adding a little bit of a serif or tapering it out a little like in Palatino Italic.
    Many of the bottom strokes are bland too, and to some extent this is good because
    it keeps it from being too dazzling, but I think you should spice it up a little
    bit, like on the descenders of p and q maybe. Some of your curves seem a bit deformed,
    too--most evident in the O. Something odd is going on on its left, especially
    at the SW area but also in NW. Make the curves flow smoother and maybe move your
    bottom control node a little to the right. I enjoy the flavor--like soft serve.
    I second Auricfuzz in missing the cursive stroke endings. Right now the design
    seems kind of static. I think you could make it more dynamic by curving some things
    that are straight, like for example the leg of the k. Overall very smooth and
    friendly and creamy and I want to use it as a bed and sleep on it. Maybe have
    some hot chocolate.

  body: "Hello again!!!\r\nI've uploaded a pdf - TherezaTest - on the top of the page
    with a sample of Thereza on running text (didn't know how to upload a file on
    a new message). I'm curious to know what you all think of it. I'm aware that there
    is still a lot of work to do. I'm still not happy with some of the character.
    Not sure if the q t e v are working. I also don't know if I keep the top of the
    R for all round-square forms or the top of the P."
