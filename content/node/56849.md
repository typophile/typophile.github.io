  bar) of Adobe Illustrator CS4.\r\nWhen using the Type Tool, it only displays Font,
  Font Style, and Font Size.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see leading, kerning and tracking
  as well without having to click on \"character\". You used to be able to do this
  in older versions of Illustrator.\r\n\r\nI attached a pic.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/controlpanel_4105.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "The only difference I see to CS3 is that the edit boxes for Transform have
    been removed (and now you mention it, yeah, that sucks too). No leading, tracking,
    and kerning.\r\n\r\nIt's not a biggie for me, I have the Character panel open
    all the time anyway.\r\n\r\nInDesign, on the other hand, has a fully customizable
    control panel -- up to each and every single item in the Character panel. A very
    useful feature that, well worth of copying to other programs in the nominally
    inappropriately named \"suite\".\r\n\r\nIn cases like this, one can only guess
    what the underlying thought was to <em>remove</em> features."
