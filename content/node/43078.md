  body: "The look and spacing of your elements seems correct. Considering how tight
    you're letter spacing is, you might want to kern the \"IN\" & \"RG\" tighter and
    loosen the \"A2\" on INTERGISA2000 and the tighten up the \"Co\" and \"Se\" on
    the rest.\r\n\r\nHowever, The transparency of the blocks seem lazy and distracting.
    Is there a reason why you did this? You are aware that there is now green elements
    (be it 2 very small corners) in your logo."

  body: "I like it. The transparency would look great if overprinted.\r\n\r\nAgree
    that the kerning is a little on the tight side, but it's an aesthetic I guess."

  body: I wanted a tight kerning so the logo would look compact. Maybe I went too
    far?
