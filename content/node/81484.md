    History of the Book</a>, which I've been poring over many a time.

  body: "There's something wrong with your link for that photostream.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    it's this one?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/bookhistorian/]]\r\n\r\n(I
    had to Google; page source gave your link as to \"nofollow\", so it was no help
    at all - I don't have a reply link to your post to perhaps see its internal source.)\r\n\r\nI
    see that the reply link doesn't provide source within [QUOTE] tags in any case.
    And although I don't see a \"reply\" link below other people's posts, I can construct
    one -\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/comment/reply/81484/461373]]\r\n\r\nfrom the
    time and date link in the post\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/81484#comment-461373]]\r\n\r\nand
    I don't get a message that I don't have the rights to see this page. Something
    very bizarre is going on with the forum software."

    one I tried to link to. There are hundreds of sets there, amazing really."
