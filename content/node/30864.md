  release is part revival, part interpretation. It's a geometric display font based
  upon Luca Pacioli's 1509 alphabet of \"divine proportion.\"\r\n\r\nLuca Pacioli
  (1445-1514 or 1517) was an Italian mathematician and Franciscan friar who lived
  during the Renaissance. While he was the chairman of mathematics in Milan, he collaborated
  with and taught mathematics to Leonardo da Vinci.\r\n\r\nHe published his second
  important book \"De divina proportione,\" in 1509. This book discussed topics including
  mathematical proportion, geometry, and architecture. Along with beautiful three-dimensional
  renderings by da Vinci, Pacioli included diagrams detailing the geometric construction
  of the Roman alphabet.\r\n\r\nRead more at http://www.madtype.net\r\n"

  body: "Looks good.\r\n\r\nJust to note, Giovanni Mardersteig also designed a set
    of titling capitals called Pacioli, for use at the Officina Bodoni. I don't know
    whether that warrants a name change, maybe someone more clued up on the potential
    rammifications could offer their take on the situation."

  body: "Muz, There are definitely some optical issues with the forms, but that is
    the result of being built by a mathematician and not an artist. I decided to keep
    it true to the original form rather than fixing things like that.\r\n\r\nChris,
    I wasn't aware of Mardersteig's capitals. I'm fairly certain that there are no
    other retail fonts currently on the market with the name pacioli, though.\r\n\r\nAziz,
    I don't think that is my version. The grid lines appear to be thicker."

    if neither you nor the Mardensteigs have registered \"Pacioli\" as a trademark,
    there should be no legal problems in terms of your distributing a font by that
    name. If someone else has registered the name, they could claim infringement.
    You could register the name yourself, but you might have to prove that it could
    not be confused with any other typeface name."
