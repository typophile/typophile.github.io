  refer back to either Joshua Darden or some thread about the guy who made the font
  named \"Soul\" or even the thread about Intertypographics in the 70's....but I'm
  still going to ask since the question begs to be asked again and again by the folks
  I work with, deal with and moreover tell I'm designing type....\r\n\r\nThe Question:\r\n\r\nWhere
  are the African American Type designers? \r\n\r\nWhy do I ask? I ask because I am
  one...Ghanaian-American to be exact and I was wondering if there were any other
  African / African-American type designers out here...or is just me and Joshua...if
  so that is indeed sad...\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and I appreciate any comments,
  criticism and even the hate mail,\r\n\r\nSasabonsam from ATL"

    ethnic backgrounds (maybe a project for Tom Phinney :-)). Anecdotally you can
    only draw from the people you know personally or meet at conferences, and although
    at ATypI and TypeCon the diversity of backgrounds is quite amazing the type designer
    stereotype is certainly reinforced \u2013 there are plenty of nerdy white guys
    wearing black polo-necks, round rimmed glasses, clutching iPhones, etc., etc.,
    but there are also people in attendance from all over the world. "

    an interesting question to ask the 'commercial art' world at large. \r\n\r\n"

    also made typefaces. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.ziva.org.zw/faculty.htm\r\nhttp://www.itcfonts.com/Ulc/2621/DesignAfrika.htm\r\n\r\nThere
    have been several threads on Typophile with a similar question: where are the
    female type designers? It's good for us to find out the answers to these questions,
    and to encourage people from margins and hidden communities to achieve and to
    share, and I think that's happening all over the world now. I don't think there
    is any cause, fault, or cultural constraint at work. I can certainly see the skewed
    racial and gender distribution among type designers, but the type world is so
    very small, and populated by autodidacts and lifelong enthusiasts, I don't see
    a substantial connection between race, gender, or any other factor, and type design.
    I don't think type designers are really that similar, once you investigate their
    motivations, approach and methods. Type designers come from such different backgrounds,
    it's hard to see real stereotypes (Simon's comical exaggeration notwithstanding).
    I think Darrel is right that the larger graphic Design world is a place to inquire
    about these issues. "

    perfect:\r\n\r\n\"Printing is what we do. You send the text and a check, and go
    home and pray. We do not know what will happen until we are at the press. The
    design of your poster is determined in real time. Sometimes we produce beautiful
    posters and at other times we produce BEAUTIFUL posters.\"\r\n\r\nI love that!"
