  body: It might be too subtle on its own, but once its seen in context &#40;actually
    on the pyramid&#41; then I think it&#39;ll probably become obvious.

  body: Great Job! Very memorable design, while not being heavy-handed. <BR> <BR>I
    did find the pyramid to be a  bit subtle... For a while I only saw a truncated
    &#34;E&#34; until the other half from the Z came into focus. <BR> <BR>I wonder
    if there is a way to make another suggestion in the upper left serif of the E.
    Maybe a slight flourish to hint at the pyramind once again. <BR> <BR>

  body: The pyramid is subtle but works. IMPO you might try to push the 60 degree
    angle into the other letterforms. It&#39;s a good start to a great idea.

  body: Try pushing the idea of simple geometry into the letterforms. Take a look
    at the Zales logo. They tried something like you are trying...They didn&#39;t
    do a good job.  <BR> <BR>I think this idea has great potential.

  body: I like it. Certainly not overdone. I would think that pushing the 60 degree
    angle to the other letters might distract from/weaken the singularity of the pyramid
    shape

  body: I agree with not cutting any more letters. I guess what I am initianing would
    be to design a new typeface based on the predetermined 60 degree angle found in
    the letter Z. Take a look at <BR>Monotype Futura Black for some &#34;rough&#34;
    Inspiration. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205103"

  body: 'I agree with &#40;some of&#41; the others: the pyramid is a hair too subtle.
    Could you adjust it a little? <BR> <BR>Points to consider: <BR>Do you consider
    the rightmost part of the slanted stem of the Z as being the leftmost part of
    the pyramid? <BR>Do you consider the leftmost part of the serif of the Z as being
    the leftmost part of the pyramid? <BR>And which of the two is most suited for
    making the pyramid less subtle? <BR> <BR>Whatever you do ... you got memorability
    here. And likeability! &#40;It&#39;s a mark that makes me smile due to its &#39;playfulness&#39;&#41;.

  body: Hector cutting the E is too cute. If its upscale just use the name. Tiffany&#39;s
    logo comes to mind. Did they have to reference anything, I don&#39;t think so
    and they are known worldwide. Its not the logo that will make or break the company,
    its the product they offer. Who knows in two years they might move from that location
    and the pyramid icon will be lost as an idenity

    geometric period. The &#34;ROMAN&#34; type is to &#34;ROMAN&#34;.

  body: About the type. On the beginning I was thinking about something more inscriptional
    as well, but realized that the roman letter little to do with egypt so I tried
    to make it stand for elegance and refinement and as a vague reference to the napoleonic
    campaign on Egypt and the french XIX century by the modern style. This may be
    historically imprecise but so would have been using inscriptional romans. <BR>
    <BR>However I used Quadraat Sans spaced bold caps on display texts. <BR> <BR><img
