    might look at: <BR>k: problematic. your form may be the best, but it is odd. You
    won&#39;t be able to make this glyph fit the pattern anyways, what if you used

    be more consistent if it bowed out right then stright down &#40;thin the join
    like the a&#41; <BR> <BR>t: Cheat the curve on the bottom. Make it start a little

    glyphs one might be tempted to dismiss it as just another constructed font, but
    I first saw the texture of the setting, and it immediately hit me: this is the
    true Egyptian style! :-&#62; One the other hand, your heavily ligated&#42; settings
    look a lot like the Indian Devanagari script! Really huge potential there, in
    terms of a display face to accompany Indian text, or just Latinate text about
    Indian stuff. You&#39;ve really shifted the nature of the Latin alphabet, but
    with practical subtlety - bravo. <BR> <BR>&#42; I&#39;d concentrate very heavily
    on this; and do look at Process&#39;s linguistically-aware &#40;sorry, John -
    &#34;orthographic&#34; means something else to me&#41; Lingua design -and its
    development- when deciding what pairs to provide. <BR> <BR>The glyphs that don&#39;t
    work are the &#34;k&#34; and &#34;x&#34;. For the former you need a simpler shape,
    or you could try the structure with a loop on top and a short arm on the bottom
    - or maybe an open loop with an arm. For the &#34;x&#34; try making the top a
    semi-circle and the bottom two distinct arms, like the &#34;H&#34; in PsyOps&#39;s
    inimitable Spanner. <BR> <BR>Other problematic glyphs are the &#34;t&#34; &#40;not
    sure what to do about it&#41; and the &#34;w&#34; &#40;I&#39;d make it like two
    &#34;v&#34;s&#41;. <BR> <BR>And yes, do make heavier weights &#40;with no stroke

  body: This is really beautiful! I like the way the color font looks like certain
    early arabic scripts &amp; of course as Hrant said Indian ones as well. It was
    hard to see if the changes you made made the text easier to read or not. Maybe
    they made the letterforms too homogenous. My inexperience at evaluation greeking
    is probably to blame... Would you post something in English? <BR> <BR>BTW - Is
    the intent of this face that it be good at long text settings or is it meant to
    be mostly a display face? I think it has real potential as a text face actually!
    It is remarkably pleasant to roll your eyes over. <BR> <BR>I like the idea of
    the &#39;x&#39; but what about two rounded bowls &#40; like the one on top&#41;
    instead of the hybrid? For some reason the hybrid is catching &amp; holding my
    eye for too long.  <BR> <BR>The y is doing the same thing but to a much lesser
    extent. I think it&#39;s decender looks unrelated to the rest of the font. <BR>
    <BR>Have you looked at the forms from early arabic Kufic Script <a href="http://www.arabiccalligraphy.com/resources_detail.php?resId=1"
    target="_blank">http://www.arabiccalligraphy.com/resources_detail.php?resId=1</a>
    or indian &#40; hindi &#43; lots of others &#41; scripts? The hindi example is
    the best one for me in terms of showing the effect of the running horizontal line
    with shapes seeming to hang off it. Hindi is more extreme but the simulatity of
    effect is striking to me! <BR> <BR>I am excited to own this one.

    <BR>It&#39;s tempting to see this as a display face, and I think it would SELL
    better as such. But i think Matthew has an opportunity to reward people brave
    enough to use this for text by keeping more of the divergence, and thus produce
    something truly progressive. <BR> <BR>Maybe there should be two weights: this
    one for text, and a much darker and more homogenous one for titling. But then
    you do need another weight &#40;a semi&#41; for emphasis - I think italics can

    Didot where display was accounted for in the details at large sizes rather than

    a completely parrallel example - especially since some folks hate it when a didone

    been trying to weed out the unusually odd characters in both versions and think
    that I&#39;m almost there.  <BR> <BR>The following were changed on the book version:
    uppercase B, G, and the numerals. <BR> <BR>On the display version I got rid of
    the weird K and used the same new B from the book version. <BR> <BR>I fixed the
    S5 issue, thanks for pointing that out Malyce. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t decide whether
    to make the book version&#39;s &#34;b&#34; and &#34;d&#34; like the &#34;a&#34;
    and &#34;u&#34; where the bowl hits the vertical at the base of the character.
