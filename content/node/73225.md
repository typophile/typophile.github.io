  through typeface specimens.  Then I came across this one: Empire Gothic produced
  by Keystone Type Foundry.  It was love at first site.  What personality!\r\n\r\nI
  can't seem to find any additional information for it on the web, but can anybody
  recommend anything similar?  Even something that's not slanted would do.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/empiregothic_6099.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnother
  incomplete specimen in this book that leaves a lot to the imagination is Tudor Medium.
  \ Anybody have a complete specimen of this?"

    designer appears to be unknown. It shows up in the 1912 ATF book and ATF bought
    Keystone in 1919. Based on the design my <em>guess</em> is that it\u2019s a nineteenth
    century design that was pirated and sold by Keystone as Empire Gothic. It looks
    like an Inland Type Foundry design, comparing the 1908 ATF book with the 1912
    might shed some light on that hypothesis."
