  French invoice apparently dated 1914...\r\nhttp://olddesignshop.com/2012/02/free-vintage-image-french-invoice/\r\n\r\nInteresting
  detail with the diamond 'Q' tail and the relatively squashed bowl on the 'U'...\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  clues or references?\r\n\r\n\r\nmany thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/OldDesignShop_FrenchReceiptAug1914_whole_6727.gif]"

    era were not typeset.\r\nFor a substitute, without the special _Q_ think about
    a squarish  sans serif. Perhaps Meta https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-meta/\r\nDon"

    a slightly condensed Engraver's Gothic...\r\n\r\n\r\nmany thanks\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: "Copperplate Gothic was designed by Frederic W. Goudy for ATF in 1901. The
    condensed versions shown in my 1923 ATF type book are a good match for the digital
    ones now available from Linotype https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/copperplate-gothic/\r\nI
    have not checked the earlier ATF books, but I expect that the condensed versions
    were offered before 1914 and would probably have been a familiar face to the French
    Engraver.\r\nClip the mini serifs and Voil\xE0!\r\nDon"
