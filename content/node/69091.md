  and loved the font they used. Does anybody knows which is it?\r\nHere's the link
  to the svg: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Deutsches_Reich1.svg\r\nI
  also attached a png without the maps, just with the text.\r\nBest regards,\r\n"

    and not Humanist 777 due to the dot on the i.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liegnitz_4973.jpg]\r\n\r\nPS.
    Here is the <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/Deutsches_Reich1.pdf\">pdf
    map</a>; it's easier to see."
