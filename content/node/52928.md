  body: "Looks custom. Perhaps based on something like Trade Gothic or News Gothic
    with an enlarged horizontal scale. \r\n\r\nThe <em>r</em> seems to be taken from
    the <em>n</em>. A lot of gothics have vertical terminals on the small stroke of
    the <em>r</em>. But the <em>r</em> in this logo has an angular terminal.\r\n\r\n(image

  body: "It's Adobe Sans, horribly extended and squashed. In other words: the original
    font wasn't loaded and poor Adobe Sans had to emulate it.\r\n"
