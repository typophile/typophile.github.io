  body: Not really, though I'm fairly sure I don't want to do the fake-overlap thing.
    V and W are going to be tricky too.

  body: 'Yes! Ross is probably the reigning master of the French Clarendon. Ideally
    this thing I''m sketching would work out a little denser, and with more super-elliptical
    curves. I really admire some of his solutions. That uppercase Q is impressive. '

    to solve the M. I might try thicker middle strokes for it just to get the width
    out of it. "

    I'd considered, but I'd really like the inside legs of the M to hit baseline,
    and ideally have a sheared-off vertex. From a purely geometric standpoint, your
    solutions follow the rules set by the other letters perfectly."
