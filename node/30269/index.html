  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Starting Fall semester (I&rsquo;m in my senior year at college) we drew a specialty shop category out of a hat, I received &ldquo;Fly Fishing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From there we were to think of a name - but the teacher pretty much vetoed all of our ideas, and named the stores herself, so I ended up with &ldquo;Fly Tie&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From there we had to decide what our specialty shop offered to make it so special. Obviously with such a name, I didn&rsquo;t have much room - so my shop offers a place for urban professionals to come learn how to tie flies in between their fly fishing trips. Think of it as a sewing club for men that like to fly fish, it&rsquo;s a place to chat and gossip and learn more about their favorite sport.</p>
<p>From there we had to create a logo, it was hard to come up with something that represented fly fishing as a whole, and showed the community/group aspect of my store. I finally decided on the &ldquo;knot&rdquo; or line wrapping look. It&rsquo;s based on tying flies, how you wrap the line around the hook to get started, and continue to wrap the line to add materials to the hook. It also represents the &ldquo;Duncan loop&rdquo; probably the most common knot tied in fly fishing. Finally the knot presents the individuals wraps (the customers) coming together to form one solid piece (the store).</p>
<p>So I thought this idea covered, fly tying (what the shop offers), the actual fishing part (what the customer loves to do), and the community aspect very well (the essence of the store). Not to mention it had an upper class, sophisticated look to it (read more about the font in the communication plan below).</p>
<p>Check out my communication plan here for more info:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rosem.com/work/random/commPlan.pdf">www.rosem.com/work/random/commPlan.pdf</a></p>
<p>Let me know what you guys think. I know the logo is no where near done as of now, that why I&rsquo;m looking for comments. Next semester is starting soon and I want to get to see what other designers things of it as is.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Mike</p>

<p>We have a lot of specialty fly-fishing shops here, and they are almost invariable &ldquo;woodsy&rdquo;: more than one uses Papyrus as the font&hellip;.  ;-)  I like your take better, though: trendy withougt looking like a fashion victim.</p>

<p>I based the word mark off of Centennial and that font is very easy to read. Can you see what I lost in the transition from Centennial to my custom font/work mark?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s those extra loops without sufficient contrast.  Centennial is a nice, clean font, but those loops make it very muddy.</p>
<p>I like your choice of colour palettes though: if you play around with them and have the name in one colour and the extra loops in another, I think it would work well.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a thorough read of your communication plan, but I did spot a number of missing hyphens, commas, and some awkward rivers of white space because of the justification.  You probably already know you need to fix those up too, right?  ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Areas I would look at in the wordmark are the bottom loop of f and y, the f needs one to improve its recognisability and the y&rsquo;s is too cramped; does it really need the ligature between fly and tie? I would read it as flytie rather than two words; the e should have a small amount of overshoot on the top of the x height to avoid it appearing smaller than the other characters which have a flat serif, the tail seems to taper rather quickly. The feature where the ‘vertical’ translates into a curve works well on the l and t, I wonder if the inside of the f should do that, it currently creates a little notch.</p>

<p>Found your logo from the posting on the Chum. I like the logo but it was hard to read. I played with it a little using the crude tools in MS Paint.  Offsetting the colors helped me see the name better and and all logo&rsquo;s have to have a hook ;-)</p>

<p>Also - I played with putting the hook in&hellip; Although it wasn&rsquo;t working for me, as the hook would have to be HUGE for it to make sense - as it&rsquo;s a very &ldquo;zoomed in&rdquo; on the knotting/tying.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can see what you mean by the design being to busy, I agree with that - and I think that leads into the legibility (or the lack of) of the logo design.</p>
<p>However, I disagree with the strait forwardness of fly fishing.  After doing my research, (which included many different sources, including a trip to a fly fishing shop in the Chicago area) my understanding that fly fishing was anything but basic/strait forward. It&rsquo;s an art that takes years and years to perfect, which might even be impossible with all the little things that can always be improved on.  I think thats why makes most people go to fly fishing, and why they enjoy it (the challenge, and the detailing of everything).</p>
<p>Most people I talked to compared it to chess, and regular fishing being checkers - which I think sums it up perfectly.</p>
<p>Anyone agree/disagree?</p>

<p>IMHO the logo is kind of confusing. I don&rsquo;t really know whats going on there, i do see Fly tie -something, but the upper part of the logo is confusing my eyes, what bothers me the most is that swoosh at the right part of the Y connecting to the T just doesn&rsquo;t seem to work that well. Maybe you might want to play around with it some more?</p>
<p>As for the logo as an insignia is nice, and strong, but than your going to find away to make people understand it, without having a typo expert explain it. Ask someone like a neighbor or a guy/girl from the street ask what they read. because people here are all visual lovers and most of us have a sense for type.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
