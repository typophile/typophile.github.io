body: "Greetings. It's been a while since my last visit, but this is one of my favorite
  forums and I think I'll stay awhile this time.\r\n\r\nMy college has a logo that
  was once official (it's been demoted, but is still very popular). It was designed
  back before EPS stood for anything, so there's no vector of it online (which is
  not a big deal, it's pretty easy to trace it). I doubt the college would offer up
  a vector either, considering its unofficial status.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to know
  is, what exactly is this font?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bullet_logo_6644.gif]\r\n\r\nHere's
  what I've managed to glean off of it, beginning with the obvious:\r\n- Sans serif\r\n-
  No bars on the I (and presumably the J)\r\n- Bowls are closed\r\n- Verticals are
  all equally long and wide\r\n- Stroke in R is wider than vertical\r\n- Bowls in
  R and P have entirely different proportions- R's is shorter, P's is thinner\r\n\r\nI
  presume that this font is the kind that tries to keep its capital characters in
  line- what I mean is, there is probably no capital letter taller than any other-
  and that most characters are boxy and symmetrical- no spurs or complicated stems
  or what have you.\r\n\r\nHas anyone got any ideas?"
