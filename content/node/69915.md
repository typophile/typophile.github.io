  I'd like to translate the template and therefore I need the exact font, but it's
  too small for me to identify it with some online tools and guides.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/allbuttons_3813.png]"

  body: "I'm still unable to replicate the same looks with trebuchet, and I don't
    own Meta, but it looks promising. I contacted the original author of the template
    to tell me the exact font (if I'm buying it, I want it to be the right one), but
    got no reply since then.\r\n\r\nI would be really glad if you could help me on
    replicating the looks of this buttons on a hungarian translation. I can provide
    the blank buttons and the hungarian text of course, or if you can help me set
    up the exact text settings in ps that would be a big help too."
