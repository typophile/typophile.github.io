  body: 'Art for arts sake. It pretty but doesn''t say anything about your agency
    or its portfolio. The type is a mess and doesn''t really say anything. It should
    be more direct and point you to a direction to see the portfolio. When I''m on
    the web I don''t want to fight to find links or information. Unlike print its
    a media that I have very little patients with. Its not like you can close the
    cover and reopen it to the last page you were reading. Remember: KISS (Keep It
    Simple Smarty)'

  body: "Eslam some thoughts about your site. First it takes to long to load. You
    should have a percentage by the loading flash files and you need a link to by
    pass flash pages. I hate waiting on flash pages. Your name on the opening page
    has a thin orange line cutting across it. (I'm on a Mac G4 using OS 10.3.9 and
    viewed your page using Mozilla) Once I got to your sample pages It took forever
    for the samples to load and they are far to small to make a decision about them.
    Make it where you can click on the image and it will allow it to fill the screen.
    Your samples have no copy to explain what you actually did on the project. All
    the pretty pictures without copy will not make one sale. One last note the 2nd
    sample in the interactive the justified type on the first line is terrible. Either
    fix that type or don't show that sample.\r\nI think you are trying to hard, trying
    to do to much and thus not doing it well. Try to focus on your strengths as a
    designer. If your work is mostly focused on print, focus on print and tell your
    clients you also do web as well but don't try to be all things to all people.
    It doesn't work. "

  body: "Ask yourself if you really need to use Flash. Often you don't. Then consider
    the fact that no everyone browses the internet with a gigantic browser window.\r\n\r\nFix
    those two things and you'll vastly improve the site."
