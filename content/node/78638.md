body: "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nMy first post this year so I guess a hearty \"Happy
  New Year\" is due!\r\nI am currently working on building a brand for myself and
  man is that hard.\r\n\r\nAfter tinkering around for quite sometime I have, for the
  time being, settled on this wordmark. The thing is, I do not want to associate myself
  with any imagery and would like to stick to letters. What I felt was that \"nothing
  can go wrong when its my NAME!\" Right?\r\n\r\nWell, anyways, so here is the wordmark
  and I have broken my full name into pieces. How readable is it? Honest feedback
  will be appreciated. Other than legibility any other issues that are blatantly blatant?
  I have tracked each of these pieces quite a bit. \r\n\r\nI am an information designer
  (work mostly with wayfinding solutions) so it is very important that all the \"information\"
  is clear. Obviously :-) Hoping to hear from you all soon!"

    it that or is it a single word?\r\nI'd try moving Y to the right just a little
    bit more."

  body: "I wasn't sure initially if it was your first and last names, or just one
    name, so I looked it up through your profile and saw it was both. Perhaps in India
    (where I see you live) this would already be obvious, but if you also intend to
    use the wordmark in countries where those names are less common, you might want
    to consider differentiating the 2 names from each other in some way (font weight
    or style or color). Although I'll say that one thing I like about your wordmark
    is its simplicity, and maybe using 2 weights or styles or colors would spoil that.
    \r\n\r\nOne thing that bothers me a little is that on the left edge we have a
    strong alignment, but on the right edge because of the \"A\" and \"Y\" the alignment
    is visually much weaker. Hanging the A and Y further to the right might give you
    a better visual alignment.\r\n\r\nYou also might try reversing it out of a shape,
    so you'd have white type reversing out of a black or gray box.\r\n"

    random letters stacked like an chart at the eye doctor. \r\n\r\nMaybe if it was
    a name I immediately recognized, it would stand out more. But even then, I find
    it absurd to break words into separate lines when centuries of human evolution
    have taught us to read each line by itself. No offense, but I can't fathom why
    a wayfinding designer would think this is a good idea? Clarity is your bread and
    butter! \r\n\r\nA good rule of thumb for a personal identity is to think about
    trying to sell your logo to your ideal client. If you don't think they'd buy it,
    it's probably not the right logo for you. "

  body: 'i don''t think it''s an absurd design approach. it''s been done successfully
    before. and i probably wouldn''t worry to much about how we''ve evolved to read.
    You''ll read it left to right top to bottom. One big issues is that your name
    is not very common, well at least in the west it''s not. maybe stacking is creating
    more confusion then it needs to. '
