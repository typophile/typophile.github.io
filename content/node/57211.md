body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm now adding OpenType features (for the first time :D ) to my
  Geometro typeface.\r\nI have merged \"ae\" and \"oe\" glyphs, but where should I
  put my OT code \"sub A E by AE;\", etc?\r\nCurrently I've put them at Discrete Ligatures
  (dlig).\r\n\r\n\r\nMy FontLab problems:\r\n\r\nI'm getting this error when compiling
  OT features:\r\n-\"[WARNING] <MFGeometroProOT-Light> Start of new pair positioning
  subtable; some pairs may never be accessed: [question P T V W Y Z z ...] [four six
  A J a c d ...] [C:/Documents and Settings/Martijn van Berkel/Mijn documenten/FontLab/Studio5/fontlab.fea
  126]\"\r\n\r\nThese warnings when saving font:\r\n- \"Do you want to rebuild the
  kern OpenType feature?\" (Clicking Yes removes my kern code. I compiled it before
  saving, so nothing is changed.)\r\n- \"UPM size is not 1000 which is not recommended
  for OpenType.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this warning after saving:\r\n- \"[WARNING] <MFGeometroProOT-Light>
  The feature file OS/2 overrides TypoAscender and TypoDescender do not sum to the
  font bbox size!\"\r\n\r\nCould someone explain these errors?\r\n\r\nI find it unfortunate
  that no Help library is supplied and accessible through Help or F1.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn"

  body: "Why would you need an opentype feature for the (french) \u0152 and (scandinavian)
    \xC6 in the first place?\r\nThey are (AFAIK) considered separate and unique glyphs
    and are never typed in as OE and AE - always as a separate glyph on the keyboard.\r\nUnless
    your font is just for setting old, archaic text where you want to force OE into
    \u0152 and EA into \xC6 you don't need to program this in OpenType - all those
    who need these glyphs should know how to type them in directly..."

  body: "Mart\u0133n, \r\n\r\nif you want, you can duplicate your AE and OE glyphs
    as \"A_E\" and \"O_E\" for uppercase, and \"a_e\" and \"o_e\" for lowercase, and
    then include a \"dlig\" substitution for them. I'd also include them in \"hlig\"
    (historical ligatures). There are indeed cases (such as in English) where one
    might want to use a ligature in ae and oe. For example, in contemporary English,
    the word \"aesthetically\" is spelled with \"ae\" and not \"\xE6\" but in some
    cases, designers may want to use them to evoke a historical or more stylized spelling
    of the word, which would look like \"\xE6sthetically\" then, but typing in the
    \"\xE6\" letter from the keyboard is not what they would usually want. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"

    do differently with the outline construction that could improve the execution
    of the concept considerably, if you're interested in detailed feedback.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
