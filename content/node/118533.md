  I always end up with approximations of this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/194_3841.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  is in harmony to the page, the spread, and well balanced.\r\n\r\nNow my question
  is: what about the last page when the text block happens to be placed on a verso
  and the recto empty? Would I move the text block a little more into the middle of
  the page, because a balancing text block on the verso is missing? How is this handled
  traditionally?"

  body: "I wouldn\u2019t do it, as I wouldn\u2019t when text is on the recto and the
    verso is blank.\r\nAn exception would be if the page contains something not directly
    related to the text (a list of other books in the same collection, for example).\r\nAlso
    remember to account the folding when calculating the inner margin: more pages
    wider margin."

  body: I wouldn't either. Also consider that most books are printed on thin paper
    and there is some show-through. Your unusual placement of the closing text would
    be obvious.

  body: "Agreed with above, keep the last page in the same position.\r\n\r\nThe design
    unity of the book as a whole is more important than balancing any one spread.
    Breaking the consistency for the sake of one page weakens the conviction of the
    layout across the whole book."

  body: Agreed, you should design the book as a whole and not design it as a series
    of spreads. If you made the end spread different, it might look right by itself,
    but would look off when viewed in context with the rest of the book.

  body: "Thanks everybody, that makes sense.\r\n\r\nI assume the back of the jacket
    is all together a different matter anyway, and there text can be centered (even
    should be) independently from the interior of the book."

  body: Right, the jacket can, and should, have a different layout from the interior.

  body: I wouldn't go as far as saying that you shouldn't consider the grid from the
    inside pages to provide some sort of continuity between the inside and the jacket,
    but it isn't necessary or even done all that often. The main consideration for
    the jacket is that it help sell the book.
