  really enjoy the site! I have a new found love for type, but still have much to
  learn. \r\nI have a million questions, but I will start slow and steady :)\r\n\r\nAny
  tips for combining typefaces? I have read as much info as the internet and books
  can offer and thought I would ask here. From what I can understand, they should
  obviously match mood and provide enough contrast. Also, the x-heights and glyph
  widths should be similar. However, when searching for fonts to purchase or in your
  own library what is the best way to make those comparisons? \r\n\r\nThe art of combining
  typefaces beyond the traditional pairings I come across amazes me. \r\n\r\nThanks
  so much!"
