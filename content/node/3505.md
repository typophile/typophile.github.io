body: Anyone interested in showing off ID/Style Guides they&#39;ve put together for
  clients? I haven&#39;t done one in years and am now about to do one for our state
  agency. I have the basics down &#40;color rules, size restrictions, placement, media
  types, etc.&#41; However, this is going to be targeted specifically at the average
  employee, as we do not have a formal marrketing group to force adherence. So I&#39;m
  interested in anything that is targeted at the LCD...the rogue webmaster putting
  together an intranet oblivoius to IT standards or the secretary that is getting
  logo sweatshirts done &#39;just for fun&#39; type of thing. <BR> <BR>Or anything,
  really...I just like looking at style guides. ;o&#41;

    seems to be the &#39;holy grail&#39; piece of the ID system, you will find agencies
    that specialize in just id guides. <BR> <BR>We have put together around a dozen,
    but nothing really worth posting. <BR> <BR>What you may be able to find is online

    the standard windows fonts listed on it to find their &#34;corporate&#34; type

    guy who runs the Savannah headquarters had specified Arial Narrow as the font
    they had to use for EVERYTHING. <BR> <BR>Memos, email, powerpoint presentations,
    etc.  Needless to say it was quite ugly. <BR> <BR>Last I heard he changed his
    mind and switched to something else. <BR> <BR>My Aunt had to make me promise I
    wasn&#39;t going to write an email to him to complain about the use of Arial Narrow
    and to suggest different, more readable/aesthetic fonts to use instead.'

  body: Thanks Kyle. I had forgotten all about that identityworks.com site. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    actually found a handful of good university style guides, which is probably as
    close as I&#39;m going to get to the type of verbage I need for this project.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ll post what I have so far hopefully today. <BR> <BR>Also, while I&#39;m
    at it, has anyone had to design an ID system where there is an existing &#39;seal&#39;
    that is often used? Be default or state&#39;s seal has become the de-facto &#39;logo&#39;
    for any agency that is too lazy to use the seal properly.  <BR> <BR>Oh...and as
    to the system font thing...my first gig was as an intern at 3M. I could use pretty
    much anything as long as it was either Times or Helvetica. <BR> <BR>As much as
    we cringe at using system fonts, there are financial &#43; IT related reasons
    for doing it, and consistency with system fonts is probably better than no consistency
    at all. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if I can convince the powers that be here that
    we should also be considering type setting standards. We hardly have a stationery
    system at this point. I have a lot of talking to do... ;o&#41;

    <BR> <BR>Additionally, I need some opinions on the following final logo that I
    came up with. Having worked with this mostly at small sizes, I began viewing it
    large and realized I wasn&#39;t sure which line type was better: sharp or soft
    corners. The soft corners &#39;feel&#39; a bit nicer, but the sharp corners seem
    to tie into the type better. Opinions? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28288.gif"

  body: 'I think the style guide is good. <BR> <BR>On the style guide, depending on
    who your audience is, it might help to separate out the logo use and abuse advice
    for different media/functions: one page for use on the web &#40;size, borders,
    file-type etc&#41;; one page for color printing; one page for black and white
    printed matter; one page for signage etc. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, there may be a danger
    that people say &#39;Oh well, I prefer the signage version, and although I&#39;m
    about to put out a leaflet, it&#39;s &#34;approved&#34; so I think I will use
    that.&#39; Also some of your audience may start reading about Pantone colors and
    just think &#39;This is all stuff for professional printers, I reckon I&#39;ll
    just do the best I can&#39; <BR> <BR>It might also be useful to divide sections
    clearly into &#34;Preferred&#34; &#34;Tolerated&#34; &#34;Forbidden&#34; categories:
    sort of red, amber and green. Otherwise my guess is people will tend to treat
    anything not expressly prohibited as permitted. That&#39;s how &#40;we&#41; lawyers
    think. <BR> <BR>Do you need as many alternatives as you have? For instance, do
    you need both the green on black and the black on green horizontal versions &#40;since
    both have the red too&#41;? Which is preferred, or is it a totally free choice?
    Is the version with the logo preferred to the all-words version, or don&#39;t
    you mind?'
