  from the distinguished Hallmark Design Collection, a premium set of script and lettering-style
  typefaces. Each Hallmark font contains the quality, innovation and care that are
  reflected in the Hallmark brand. \r\n\r\nThe Ascender type development team collaborated
  with Hallmark to produce the fonts in TrueType and OpenType formats, and is making
  the fonts available today for licensing and instant download from Ascender\u2019s

  more than four decades, Hallmark Cards has created typefaces influenced by art,
  fashion and popular culture. These fonts were developed by Hallmark specifically
  for proprietary use in greeting cards, framed sentiments and other forms of social
  expression. The agreement allows Ascender to offer designers and developers an exceptional
  range of script fonts with a rich tradition of typographic excellence. \r\n\r\nThe
  fonts in the Hallmark Design Collection feature a wide range of visual styles from
  timeless calligraphic lettering to handwritten characters with a contemporary look.
  Hallmark fonts can bring the right personal touch to cards, scrapbook pages, posters,
  newsletters, presentations, advertisements and websites. \r\n\r\n\u201CWe are pleased
  to be working with Ascender to offer these celebrated fonts to everyone from scrapbookers
  to web developers,\u201D said Jill Wiederholt, Licensing Director at Hallmark Licensing.
  \u201CThe Ascender team shares a passion for creativity and excellence, and understands
  how to meet the demands for licensing digital fonts in today\u2019s market.\u201D\r\n

  high quality TrueType and OpenType versions with a full complement of glyphs that

  Design Collection fonts feature an impressive lineup of both formal and informal
