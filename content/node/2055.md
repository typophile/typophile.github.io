  body: The &#39;a&#39;, &#39;t&#39;, &#39;2&#39; are pretty Arial-ish <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I think when I finally get to designing a font,
    it&#39;ll have a &#39;Squooshed&#39; style, in honour of Ms. Wardle and Typophile.
