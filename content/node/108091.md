body: "I'm looking for this font. It's my dad's company's logo and I'm trying to figure
  out what the original font used is so I can use it to create other headers for his
  website... the logo was made at least 10 or 15 years ago.. it looks like [[http://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/linotype-killer?isRatingExpanded=False|linotype
  killer]] and [[http://summittype.com/fonts/16613/namino.html|namino]] but not exactly..
  I tried [[http://www.identifont.com/index.html|Identifont]] to search by appearance
  and by similarity but no luck. Also tried [[http://www.whatfontis.com/|whatfontis.com]]
  but no luck. It COULD be a custom font? But I highly doubt the original designer
  would've went through all that trouble because I have reason to believe it might
  have been made as a favor for my dad or done very cheaply.\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated!
  And Thanks!"

    that is useful in any way. Regards!
