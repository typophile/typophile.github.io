body: I have been trying to find this script font. I realize the letters appear connected,
  such with the &#34;v&#34; in Dave and the &#34;B&#34; in Buster&#39;s. But I don&#39;t
  think the original font looked like this, it was probably separate. If someone knows
  of a font that is real similar, that would be awesome! <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/51377.jpg"
