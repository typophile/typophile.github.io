  their library? I haven't been able to find any.

    Moye's \"Fleurons\", for one; this I believe to be at least <em>gratis</em> if
    not <em>libre</em>.\r\n\r\nGeorge Douros has, IIRC, made several <em>libre</em>
    symbol fonts. Note to self: Get the hfil around to document them."

  body: Thanks. Unfortunately, a competition I was going to submit to requires GWF
    only and no use of images. Perhaps in the future.

    all that kind of thing even if its in the original fonts, sadly."

  body: "Hey, guys. Sorry for the late reply.\r\n\r\nIt was a competition for typesetting
    a poem. It was something really small and ridiculous. It was mostly web developers
    taking part.\r\n\r\nThanks for the info, Dave."

    for an, say, ornamental font? In which case we would need such an ornament font,
    and I don't think you are interested in commissioning such pi/ornament fonts since
    Google wants and aims to make the web more \"readable\" than nicer. After all
    , an aldus leaf means for Google's crawling nothing, right?\r\n\r\n* Such a f*cking
    forum style! The year is 2013, the forum is all about typography, the theme is
    readability, but there is not even a simple quoting mechanism and one still must
    expressively quote like \"Jonny said:\"! "

    the same problem applies to Unicode-compliant ornamental fonts, because they subsetting
    will cut out the glyphs that are not in the latin/latin-ext ranges."
