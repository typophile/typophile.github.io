    target="new">Berthold Akzidenz-Grotesk</a>, a precursor to Helvetica and IMHO
    a much nicer typeface.

    Anything you can arrange? ;^)\r\n\r\nDavid, you're dead on. My take on Helvetica
    is if you're gonna use it you'd better have a <em>damn</em> good reason. :^/"

    to warn you there's a very strict policy about that on Typophile. No font piracy
    allowed here -- you can't do anything that violates the End User License Agreement.
    So no swapping or giving away fonts."

  body: "Actually it isn't huge at all. I do have a Bitstream Collection on CD-ROM,
    but for the rest it's a hand-picked compact selection. As my independent design
    business is pretty low-scale, I can't really go wild on licensing type unfortunately.
    Furthermore I finally did the right thing a couple of years ago and removed all
    and any fonts that weren't duly licensed (we're not talking libraries here, just
    a couple of families that I had \"lying about\"). Apart from the odd family that
    I need to finish something at home for my daytime job and that gets deleted after
    the job is done, my computer is clean.\r\n\r\nI do get type for my reviews on
    an occasional basis, but I take great care to remove all files after the review
    has been published or even earlier if the review license stipulates so (for example
    Typoth\xE8que review licenses are limited to 7 days)."

  body: Ah, yeah I forgot about this...the fact that your review licenses are only
    short term. If that wasn't the case then I would be right! :o) There's a few faces
    I'd love to have but can't afford right now, specifically the faces of the Underware
    crew. I'll just have to wait till I get in a paid design position/out of school!

    clean pc. \"chough cough\"\r\n\r\nIf you said u have alot of typedesign and that
    if you use it for a client then you purchase the font. then i would belive you.
    \r\n\r\n\r\nthats what i do anyway. I mean if i didnt have the font in the firstplace
    i wouldnt know if it would work with the poster my cliented wanted designed. that
    way  the original typedesigner would get nothing. \r\n\r\nSo pay for what you
    use thats my philosphy. \r\n\r\nbut sure i wont share any fonts with users here.
    ofcourse . And i understand why we cant. it would be chaos if we did . and it
    would be the general understanding that people dont pay for fonts bc they are
    free. \r\n\r\nand thats not gd. "

    your clean pc. \u201Cchough cough\u201D</cite>\r\n\r\nYou obviously don't know
    who you're talking to here. There was even an interview with Yves at TypeCon this
    year on Type Radio where they asked him about his type collection. There is no
    reason why he would lie about cleaning his computer of faces that he hadn't properly
    licensed...end of story.\r\n\r\nYou'll find that this community is pretty tight
    knit and a lot of the members know each other in real life, have met through the
    board or have become friends through typography conferences such as TypeCon and
    ATypI. This is not a place to come in and throw your weight around when you are
    unaware of who you are talking to. The respect and massive knowledge base of the
    users, of which many are professionals in the field of design or type design,
    here is what brings us together...there's no need to try and discredit the other
    designers/typophiles here. This is my opinion anyways and I know you're new so
    I think this is a good way to inform you for your future stay here at Typophile!
    If you write coherently too, it helps us understand."

  body: "Yeah its nice to shed light on this subject. But my point about if you have
    fonts you use them more is valid. atleast in my case and my design friends. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nI
    had a client that i did some identity redesign for and i gave them 2 examples
    of fonts to use. dax wide and prokyon. Overused fonts i know, but they usualy
    impress clients. so i told them the price tag of the two. and i said if you want
    me to use this in your design you have to pay for the license of eighter one.
    Then i showed them the same identity design with another free font and they got
    the point. \r\n\r\nWhat happened here. well 2 things basicly. the fontdesigner
    got payed and i futhered my design career. \r\n\r\nIf i didnt have thouse fonts
    installed id never know if they would work on just that design. would I?\r\n\r\nId
    like your take on this sistuation. david and bald condensed. \r\n\r\nOh yeah.
    i bet David is american. Sounds like it. \r\n\r\nYours in faith insearchof"

    wouldn't go that far. After all, font houses don't have the monopoly on ethics

    point out).\r\n\r\nBut yeah, don't share fonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
