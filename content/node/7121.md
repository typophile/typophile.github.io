  body: I&#39;ll simplify things just a little, but.... <BR> <BR>An encoding is a
    means of defining which characters are covered by the glyphs in the font, and
    relating those characters to the glyphs. So in a Unicode encoding the character
    numbered 20AC is the euro, and in a particular font might correspond to glyph
    number 571, while in another font it might be glyph 14. &#40;Glyph numbering being
    simply the physical order of glyphs in the font, the &#34;glyph index.&#34;&#41;
    <BR> <BR>In a WinANSI encoding, the euro is encoded at &#40;decimal&#41; 128,
    while in MacRoman, it is encoded at &#40;decimal&#41; 219. <BR> <BR>A codepage
    is a defined set of characters, often &#40;though not always&#41; a single-byte
    set. Virtually always a heck of a lot smaller than all of Unicode. Back in the
    old days of single-byte fonts, you&#39;d actually use the codepage with the associated
    encoding. These days, if you&#39;re using Unicode encoding, you may still declare
    which codepages &#40;defined character sets&#41; are covered by the font&#39;s
    total character set. One font can then support several or many codepages. <BR>
    <BR>In your particular case, it seems there is no defined Mac or Windows codepage
    corresponding to the particular character set you are using. I recommend that
    you claim coverage for codepage 1252 anyway, because if you don&#39;t claim any
    codepage support your font won&#39;t show up in the font menu of some common applications
    &#40;we found that one out the hard way&#41;. <BR> <BR>I hope this helps! <BR>

  body: 'Peter,  <BR> <BR>FontLab Studio 5 will ship with a ISO 8859-15 codepage definition.
    What your customer wants is &#34;TT Unicode with the characters from ISO 8859-15
    &#40;Latin 9&#41;.&#34; This means that the customer wants the glyph repertoire
    from ISO 8859-15, but not the ISO 8859-15 encoding. The simple difference: an
    encoding is a set of glyphs with a particular order, while a glyph repertoire
    is a set of glyphs with no specified order.  <BR> <BR>That is, the the font is
    supposed to include all the characters that are covered in ISO 8859-15, but the
    ordering/encoding should be Unicode.  <BR> <BR>Go to <a href="http://www.unicode.org"
    target="_blank">http://www.unicode.org</a>, download the ISO 8859-15 character
    set definition &#40;in the Unicode data section&#41; and make sure that your fonts
    includes all characters with Unicodes mentioned in the ISO 8859-15 definition.  <BR>
