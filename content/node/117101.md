  body: "The ampersand looks like it's taken from <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Adobe&ffam=ClearfaceGothic%20LT%20Light%20-%20Regular&fid=ea8104baa7d92910a2f34f2575e61c27&fsize=60&text=%26&wrap=2|Clearface

  body: "Today's trivia. Clearface Gothic is a Morris Fuller Benton design dating
    from 1910. The \"reverse seven\" ampersand is not shown as part of the font in
    specimen books that I have seen before the ATF specimen book of 1923. In my opinion
    creation of the  \"reverse seven\" ampersand design probably dates to somewhere
    between 1910 and 1923.\r\nDon"

  body: "Cosmos Light by Berthold  is a good find Fivos. \r\nHere are some more fonts
    with similar ampersands to the lettering Cleancut, Dexterous, Priori Sans, and
    Ahmed -- which is the same as Clearface Gothic but also includes an outline version.\r\nDon\r\n[This
    was edited to correct an error]\r\n\r\n"
