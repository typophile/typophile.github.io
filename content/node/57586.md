  The client wants a blackletter similar to Letraset's \"Old English\" but what they
  provided as their concept sketch is squooshed down to fit the shape of the fingerboard.
  \r\n\r\nLots of the blackletter fonts naturally have a more condensed look to them,
  are there any that are more extended in their native form? I'd like to get them
  the look they are after, but without some horrible scaling. Any leads?"

    which comes in a pretty impressive variety of widths (and weights)."

    I'm looking for. This is heavy metal, so think Black Sabbath, etc. \r\n\r\nIf
    I wind up drawing it from scratch, there's some good hints in Moyenage for getting
    away from the smashed down look. Thanks!"

    mentions designing it because he wanted a blackletter style for a black metal
    album cover that he was thinking about.\r\n\r\nIMO this is awesome:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moyenage_4789.png]\r\n"

    Storm mentioned was that part of the problem with blackletter is that the caps
    are darned near unreadable to modern readers. So he \"latin-ized\" them. And small
    caps to (jack)boot!\r\n\r\nI'll post a link when it gets published."

    at Lettherhead looks interesting, Paul, but it's a little more condensed that
    I was hoping to start with. LHF's <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/hindlewood.shtml\">Hindlewood</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/divine.shtml\">Divine</a> are
    also cool. Good for my shopping list but not this project. \r\n\r\nStephen, Engraver's
    Olde English Bold will work well! I will still be forced to squish it a little,
    but since I'm redrawing it and reducing the contrast a little (thin lines are
    too thin to cut from mother of pearl without breaking), hopefully it won't look
    squished when I'm done. \r\n\r\nShame I can't use the Storm Moyenage. It's exactly
    the legibility that precludes it from this project. Another one for the shopping
    list.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help, everyone. I will post pics when the project
    is done, and if I'm allowed by the client, I'll post some of the design before
    we cut the letters. "

    but to a guitar player not so much, at least in the words of this particular inlay.
    \r\n\r\nDon't fret, we used Storm Solpera as an <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/blog/2127?page=1\">engraving
    on another inlay</a>, and it's perfectly legible :)"

    rough cut with a jeweler's saw in black mother of pearl. A little more refining
    to do, but so cool to have something like this you can hold in your hand. Until
    it goes into the fingerboard anyway. "
