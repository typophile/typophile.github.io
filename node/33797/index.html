  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m new here - so Hi everybody =D</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m working on the logo and website for my freelance web design company. The company is called Rawkes - I want to portray youth, strength and a feel of modernism in the logo.</p>
<p>I have come up with some graphical logos, but I will keep them off here. The latest attempt at the logo is purely text based, and I would love some feedback on it.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;R&rsquo; in the logo was designed on paper and traced into a vector application.</p>
<p>[Below is the original design]
<img src="/images/old-images/rawkes_text_4571.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>[The version below has some tweaks (..but no styling at the moment)]
<img src="/images/old-images/rawkes_text_take2_6261.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Thank you,
Rob</p>

<p>What do you mean by modernist? is it the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism">modernist art movement </a>(which I don&rsquo;t relate to much to your logo) or &ldquo;New-Fresh&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you give us a bit more background about this freelance company? What is it that you do? how different could you make it from others? why should I hire you to do some freelance work? Maybe that could help you integrate some new elements to it. Think about metaphors, or anything that could relate to it.</p>
<p>Personally, I really hate to see the &ldquo;R&rdquo; chopped like that, I recently saw it done to another logo that I can&rsquo;t recall at the moment and it really bothers me. The letter has no balance and looks like its going to fall backwards.</p>
<p>Hope that helps to keep you going!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I obviously used modernism in the wrong way - I mean I just want it to look fresh and new, exactly like you said.</p>
<p>Here is a brief background behind Rawkes. It is a web site design company set up by a young creative to build fresh, clean and efficient web sites - in both design and programming. It prides itself on following current web standards and guidelines which let it stand out from the many other &lsquo;web design&rsquo; companies that offer quick and dirty websites produced with no skill or affection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s enough spiel.</p>
<p>I think you are right about the balancing of the R, which is a shame. Luckily I came up with many different R&rsquo;s in my sketches - so I can try picking another one.</p>
<p>Do you have any advice on the styling of the R, or any metaphors that sprung to mind after hearing about me?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Rob</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Rob,</p>
<p>I do not doubt that you can build fresh, clean and efficient websites. In fact there&rsquo;s a ton of talented people out there. There&rsquo;s also plenty of mediocre design out there. There&rsquo;s a ton of people that follow web standards too, <a href="http://simplebits.com/"> here&rsquo;s one</a> that I believe do their job quite as you describe yours. I think you don&rsquo;t need to let us know your skills (your clients will see that once they see your portfolio. Instead have fun with this, put some extra meaning to it.
I like the ROCKS idea too. The name is a clever too, I believe it comes from your name &ldquo;Rob Hawkes&rdquo; right? well you got a good start. You have shorten it why not emphasize that? perhaps add an apostrophe then try to find a reason for it. First though, why do you shorten things? maybe because it doesn&rsquo;t fit somewhere, well now it does! you could play along with concepts/metaphors/stories like that. Perhaps it fits into a box or what not?</p>
<p>As of the &ldquo;R&rdquo; i would say don&rsquo;t get stuck on trying to fit a special &ldquo;R&rdquo;. If the concept recalls it, then do so after you have your Idea clear.</p>
<p>Keep it up!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>All this advice is very helpful. You were correct about the origins of the word Rawkes, I felt that I would be restricting future growth by naming the company after my full name.</p>
<p>My one concern with using a phrase (ie. Web design that Rawkes), do you mean to use a phrase as the logo - or just an idea for a banner or strap line? I&rsquo;m still a little confused about what is being suggested here for the logo in particular.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only just got up and my brain isn&rsquo;t quite up to speed, but what do you mean by &ldquo;Perhaps it fits into a box..&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>And just to clarify &hellip; my initial thought was &ldquo;Web Design Rawkes&rdquo; &hellip; without the &ldquo;that&rdquo; - it shows a passion and playfulness that simply shines freshness. However you convey that visually is up to you, but it sure opens a few more doors that just saying &ldquo;Ok, the name is Rawkes, let&rsquo;s make it [insert &lsquo;fresh&rsquo; word here]&rdquo;</p>
<p>i.e, just brainstorming</p>
<p>enjoy</p>
