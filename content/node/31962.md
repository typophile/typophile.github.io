  it's to be set in Serifa.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have some image and/or links to some
  project that were done in Serifa - I'm looking for everything really new or old.\r\n\r\nOf
  course any great links/information related to Serifa would be greatly appreciated,
  along with the correct pronunciation of it... :)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>***
  EDIT ***</strong>\r\n\r\nI should add that I have already looked over the Wiki information
  on Adrian Frutiger, and printed out the Glyph Charts from Adobe (as of right now
  I only have Serifa Std from Adobe).  Does anyone know of a better version of Serifa
  (maybe with more weights & glyphs) than what Adobe offers?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n"

    Friday evening and craves for a new typeface on every Monday morning.\r\n\r\nI
    am different: I am the one-type-per-life type.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have studied
    more than 50,000 fonts, I usually only use one font, namely Serifa, which is (in
    my view) the best slab serif typeface ever made.\r\n\r\nMost PDF documents at
    my website (http://www.sanskritweb.net) are typeset in Serifa, and e.g. my printed
    textbook of the Sanskrit language is also typeset in Serifa (as far as the Latin
    script text is concerned):\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/deutsch/leseprobe.pdf\r\n\r\nI
    have examined various Serifa font versions by Berthold, Compugraphic, URW etc.
    etc., but I always use the first PostScript version made by Adobe in the late
    1980s, and here I only use two cuts, namely Serifa 55 (Serifa normal) and Serifa
    75 (Serifa black). I never use the other cuts (Serifa Italic etc.).\r\n\r\nThe
    Adobe Serifa PS font features the original set-width system of the original photocomposition
    Serifa based on the original Monotype set-width system:\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/dickten.pdf\r\n\r\n(This
    is an instructive tutorial on set-widths for schools)\r\n\r\nAs stated by Frutiger
    in his book \"Buch der Schriften\", Wiesbaden 2005, page 218-222, all cuts of
    Serifa were planned and designed entirely simultaneously. That is why Serifa is
    a perfect slab serif font. The principles of design applied to Serifa are described
    on page 219 in Frutiger's book just mentioned.\r\n\r\nPS: In the Adobe OpenType
    Serifa, the left outward curve of the Euro sign between the two cross bars is
    faulty. I guess, Frutiger never saw and never approved of the Euro sign of the
    Adobe OT font version."

  body: "LOOOOVE this topic :-) I am a huge Serifa and Glypha fan. They are both by
    Frutiger and both match up with Univers. Glypha has a larger x-height and sets
    better for extended text passages (IMO).\r\n\r\nGlypha and Serifa Blacks, with
    manual kerning and tighter tracking, makes for an EXCELLENT titling font. Scangraphics
    has a \"headline\" (SH) version of Serifa that accomplishes the same purpose.
    I have no problem using either Glypha or Serifa (in various weights) as the EXCLUSIVE
    typeface for a project, with the caveat that documents usually benefit from more
    leading, and white space in general, than your typical sans/serif typeface combo.\r\n\r\nI
    will admit to being a Clarendon man, and I get giddy over FB Giza for display
    purposes. But good-old Glypha and Serifa are the everyday slab champs, they are
    part of my core design fonts.\r\n\r\nI cringe when someone chooses Rockwell over
    these two. Seriously, it gives me the creeps.\r\n"

    so that you could switch from Serifa to Glypha in small point sizes (5, 6, 7,
    8 point etc.) <strong>without reflow</strong> of the typeset text. However someone
    at Adobe tampered with the Glypha metrics with the consequence that Glypha is
    now only 98%, but no longer 100% identical with Serifa as regards metrics. In
    short paragraphs of text, reflow may not take place,\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/glypha.pdf,
    page 1\r\n\r\nbut in longer text passages, reflow is unavoidable due to stupid
    metrics tampering done at Adobe. For example, the Glypha-i is now <strong>wider</strong>
    than the Glypha-j (296 vs. 278 units), while in Frutiger's original fonts, both
    Serifa-i/j and Glypha-i/j had been metrically identical.\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/glypha.pdf,

    names. For starters, why did Frutiger give them different names, if the one is
    a small version of another? I also don't see the benefit of identical metrics
    and kerning between display fonts and text fonts. I'm sure Uli has an ideologically
    pure rationale for this, but the fact is that display spacing and kerning is not
    at all appropriate for small sizes. Unless thre are major differences between
    Serifa and Glypha shapes and spacing (and I don't see that), I would hardly expect
    perfection in small text setting, even from Frutiger. In other words, it's an
    interesting trick given the technology of the time, but currently less beneficial
    to readers than size-specific designs. \r\n\r\nMetric compatibility is overrated.
    It has specific uses, but for very specific uses, we have specialized typefaces
    like the agates H+F-J did for the Wall Street Journal.\r\n\r\nMike, if you are

    think the decisive question here is quite another question:\r\n\r\nGiven that
    Adrian Frutiger himself designed Glypha as a metrically identical companion to
    Serifa, is Adobe allowed to mutilate the original metrics of Glypha?\r\n\r\nThere
    is no doubt that Adobe's Glypha digitizations GlyphaLTStd.otf, GlyphaLTStd-Black.otf
    etc. are mutilated reproductions of Frutiger's original Glypha fonts.\r\n\r\nIf
    you check the metrics of Adobe's digitization of Glypha, you will find numerous
    wrong metrics (as compared with the original Glypha).\r\n\r\nWhat is more, you
    will discover that Adobe also \"forgot\" to defined the side bearings of several
    glyphs.\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/glypha3.gif\r\n\r\nSo,
    the decisive question here is not whether there is \"an enormous benefit\" by
    Frutiger's metrically companion to Serifa, but the crucial question is whether
    Adobe was allowed to mutilate the metrics of Frutiger's Glypha.\r\n\r\nBy the
    way, Adobe also did shoddy hinting here. For example, if you start Adobe's FDK
    autohint on GlyphaLTStd.otf, you will get this message:\r\n\r\n'Error: font has
    neither StemSnapH nor StdHW!'\r\n\r\nAdobe \"forgot\" to define these values required
    for proper hinting.\r\n"

    Was it an Adobe digitization of the original photofilm outlines, or did someone
    else do it? Adobe only licenses the typeface, so shouldn't the real owners be
    held responsible for making sure the metrics add up properly?\r\n\r\nI can see
    that Uli might have a point about the metrics not fitting up as an answer to Crossgrove's
    point. Because they DON'T fit now, we'll never really get a chance to see the
    benefit, dubious it may be, of a matching Serifa/Glypha set."
