  time period? Turn of the century England?

  body: Something related to this just came up on the TYPO-L list. Somebody wanted
    to know what typeface was used in the Strand Magazine where Arthur Conan Doyle&#39;s
    stories first ran. You can look at the discussion <a href="http://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0406&amp;L=typo-l&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=1571"
    target="_blank">here</a>. The conclusion was that best modern equivalent of the
    Strand type would be either <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/old-style-7/"
    target="_blank">Old Style 7</a> or <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205352"
    target="_blank">Monotype Old Style</a>. Of course, this is just one idea.
