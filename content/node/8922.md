body: I was wondering if anyone had an idea what type this was from M. Night Shyamalan&#39;s
  &#34;The Village.&#34; I assume the small cap &#40;at the begining of the credits&#41;
  and the italic &#40;at the end&#41; to be related.   <BR> <BR>At first I thought
  it to be T26&#39;s <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=213" target="_blank">Archetype</a>
  but that wasn&#39;t a match, though it was very similar. It seems to be related
  to Caslon, though it isn&#39;t <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25071.html?1075437940"
  target="_blank">Caslon Rough</a> but has similar tilt. Distinctive characters that
  may help the ID are the spur on the G, the swash overhang on the italic D, R, and
  P and the distinctive Y. Any help, of course, is appreciated.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
  think this was asked before and a search turned up nothing so pardon me if this
  is a dupe.  <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64055.jpg"
