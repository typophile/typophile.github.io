  body: "\"So what is wrong with this logo?\"\r\n\r\nI hope this is a potential client's
    existing logo and you want to tell them what is wrong with it, not something you
    designed. If it is the latter, I apologize in advance for picking it to pieces.\r\n\r\nIn
    my view:\r\n1. The skyline overtakes the type and makes it hard to read.\r\n2.
    The letterspaced all-caps Helvetica doesn't work.\r\n3. The text at the bottom
    is much too small and thin.\r\n4. The skyline is way too detailed for a logo.\r\n5.
    I don't see how this could be reproduced in one colour without losing \"CONDOMINIUM\"
    completely.\r\n\r\nOverall it looks very uninspired and thrown together. Nothing
    about the image says \"condominium\", and the logo is not very memorable. It doesn't
    work as a brand.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "ahh no need for an apology either way, but you are correct in your first
    assumption. Thanks for the critique and an admirable approach to my very broad
    question. I just wanted the upfront opinion of other designers on why the logo
    works not at all.\r\n\r\nMy real problem is that I need to design a website around
    this logo. I have been attempting many things and have a lot of ideas but i can't
    get over the logo.\r\n\r\nI have sugguested a new branding (which they need for
    other reasons besides) but they do not want to commit the funds and time and everything
    that goes along with it just yet.\r\n\r\nSo i guess i just need to make a website
    with the current logo, I am just looking for a better alternative for the client..."

  body: Been there. Ouch.  I suggest minimizing the logo's presence & creating a site
    that draws on one aspect of the logo so it ties together. Maybe the blue or the
    grey.

  body: "Tell the client that a horizontal logo will suit the website design far better,
    take the three elements and lay them out horizontally, probably skyline, condominium
    (maybe without the grad), and keep as two lines the financial management inc,
    but enlarge it to the capheight (for web legibility purposes). Sometimes gift
    of the gab helps on the other hand you might find the logo was done by a relation
    so don't hammer it too hard.\r\nTim"

    I am considering just creating for them a new logo with their current name for
    free because I don't like theirs. \r\n\r\ntimd, i might just do that thanks!"

    yourself. In Psychiatry they have a term for doing that. It's called 'enabling'.
    ;-) \r\n\r\nIf you make a nice site with a bad logo it will be clear which is
    which! There will be other better work later."

  body: "Perhaps the client is flexible enough to allow the logo to be seperated,
    so using just the type and perhaps incoperating the cliche skyline into the background,
    or toning it way down. \r\n\r\nThen of course you can switch from the all caps
    helvetica and theyll never know ;)\r\n\r\nLame morning humour\r\n\r\n"

  body: "too many elements for a logo... it could ve been made just out of type and
    forget about all these building illustrations!!\r\nThis logo doesn't work for
    business cards cuz when u scale it down you wont be able to read the very thin
    words at the bottom...\r\nthis logo doesn't work with photocopying and faxing...
    (BW)..\r\nya3ni u it is needed to make contrast in colors and especially the color
    of the type and the skylines..\r\nBut still u can make it look better:\r\njust
    change the All caps typeface of the word \"condominium\" and its color and change
    the thin font @ the bottom and study their kerning..."
