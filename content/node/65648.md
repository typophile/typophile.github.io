  'branding' for a local painter (business card, web redesign, etc.). It's a bit late
  in the game to be posting for a crit as the client's already seen drawings and is
  sold on the direction -- but I'm still fiddling quite a bit, so any fresh eyes would
  be welcome.\r\n\r\nThrough several rounds of discussion, we've settled on this sort
  of mash-up of a didone and a broken script. I'm attempting to keep it from looking
  too obviously like a mere 'mash-up' (e.g. how I feel about Dead History). Though
  the 's' is killing me in that regard. And I'm dubious about the evenness of color
  among the <em>a-r-e</em>.\r\n\r\nSo any comments would be appreciated. Thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PHIPPS_3447.png]"

    I think the smooth ball-terminal isn't really <em>right</em> for this. Maybe make
    it more like the terminal of the \\r\\.\r\nIf you have found a good way to end
    your \\a\\ also use it for your \\s\\, because the top now seems to be very heavy.\r\nYou
    could try a diagonal stroke for the \\e\\ instead of the horizontal one you have
    now, that will open up your counter and maybe help with the color-evenness you
    mentioned.\r\nDo you have a specific reason for the bottom serifs of the \\p\\s
    not being the same?"

  body: "Interesting treatment!\r\n\r\nThe ball on the \"a\" throws me off too. I
    think one reason for that is that most glyphs have the more \xABbroken\xBB/irregular
    part towards the x-line and the \xABcleaner\xBB/\xABclassical\xBB part towards
    the bottom; the \"k\" and \"a\" diverge from this pattern. In the \"k\" this is
    not so noticeable though, since the arm is so light; but the \"a\" sort of ends
    up looking like it's the wrong way round.\r\n\r\nThe \"s\" feels most like a Dead
    History style mash-up to me. The top seems too heavy and possibly too monoline?
    Not sure.\r\n\r\nAnd I second the question about what's up with the \"p\"s. If
    you want to not make them all the same, I'd rather try exploring the double-\"p\"
    combination further, maybe."

    x-line and the \xABcleaner\xBB/\xABclassical\xBB part towards the bottom</cite>\r\n\r\nGood
    point. That wasn't exactly intentional, but that certainly is how it turned out.
    That does give me a pretty good basis for revisiting the 'a'. Thanks for that
    observation.\r\n\r\n<cite>You could try a diagonal stroke for the \\e\\</cite>\r\n\r\nAn
    earlier treatment used a diagonal crossbar at a pretty severe angle, and I couldn't
    stand it. But I think I'll try a shallower angle. Or maybe a lower, yet still
    horizontal, crossbar. As you say opening the counter, as well as redrawing the
    'a', may well fix the wonky color.\r\n\r\n<cite>What kind of painting?\r\nWho\u2019s
    the customer?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe customer is a fairly traditional oil painter.
    She paints from nature, frequently outside -- representational work with pretty
    aggressive paint handling. Painters that come to mind, that she owes a debt to,
    are the late-19th c. crowd: Courbet, Manet, Cezanne <em>et al</em>. For different
    reasons: paint-handling, color, composition. \r\n\r\n<cite>Do you have a specific
    reason for the bottom serifs of the \\p\\s not being the same?</cite>\r\n<cite>And
    I second the question about what\u2019s up with the \u201Cp\u201Ds.</cite> \r\n\r\nThe
    'p's. The 'p's are treated differently (not just the bottoms but the tops as well),
    because that's how the client approaches her work. You can stand in the same spot
    on the same day making the same painting, and always be looking at something different(ly).
    Cezanne said (I don't have a citation on-hand) that moving his head a fraction
    of an inch, one way or the other, would give him an entirely new painting. Copying
    and pasting the same 'picture' of a 'p' three times isn't a fair representation
    of her or her work IMHO. That said, the treatment I have now may be a bit too
    forced, mannered, what have you.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone think that 'h' is too narrow?"

  body: "> pretty aggressive paint handling.\r\n\r\nThis could be the angle that could
    make this click. Otherwise I'd be worried that it's more like a logo for an architecture
    firm for example.\r\n\r\nFor the top of the \"a\", I might try a thin finial like
    in the \"e\". If that creates too much lightness in combination with the top-right
    of the \"k\", you could try your thin slab serif form, probably both upward and
    downward (see the \"s\" comment below). The foot serif upcurl to me is suspect
    as well, although I'm not sure how to improve it.\r\n\r\nIf the very top of the
    \"s\" is made thin that might just be enough. In any case I think the serif(s)
    in the \"s\" need to be abrupt, not tapered.\r\n\r\nThe variance in the \"p\"
    to me is exactly what's needed; it <em>is</em> for a painter. In fact I might
    use that more. Not that every serif etc. should vary, but I would try tilting
    the top serif of the \"k\" for one thing. The baseline and x-line serifs are probably
    best left totally flat.\r\n\r\nBTW, the two parts should be closer I think.\r\n\r\n>
    Does anyone think that \u2019h\u2019 is too narrow?\r\n\r\nYup.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    'a' and 's' are well-taken also. I'll explore them in the batch of revisions.
    \r\n\r\nThanks for the comments everyone. Exactly what I was needing."

    from this angle), maybe try making them more different. The second and third ones
    seem very similar; and once you scale this down, that different serif on the first
    one might not stand out all that much either."
