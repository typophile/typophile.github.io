  introduced. Economically, it's probably a better model for type founding because
  it's a more efficient use of development time in terms of reducing long periods
  of time without profit. I still get kinda bummed when I buy a \"family\" only to
  later find out that a few more kids are on the way. (Ahem, Archer, Gotham, and well
  every HFJ). \r\n\r\nSo, based on this speculation....who wants to predict what's
  next for TUNGSTEN? Right now, 4 styles.\r\n\r\nIf Tungsten follows suit...\r\nRound
  1: 4 italics and possibly a rounded or hairline. (Not sure if rounded would work
  with structure.)\r\nRound 2: Hopefully an EXPANDED and italic expanded. \r\nRound
  3: Drop caps and numerals.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Hopes?"

  body: "\r\n\r\nHi Eddie,\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks very much for sharing your thoughts.
    If I can correct one of your assumptions, Gotham's actually the only family we've
    ever released that's been followed up by later expansion: everything else has
    been published all at once. You mentioned Archer above, though we published all
    40 of its styles together on January 2008, and haven't added anything since.\r\n\r\nIt's
    not our style to hold anything back, so I wouldn't know whether it's better business
    or not. It's always been our goal to create type families that are both complete
    and manageable, which means as many styles as necessary, but as few styles as
    possible. When we designed Gotham, we imagined four weights with matching italics,
    so the product \"Gotham\" debuted with these eight styles. Little did we know
    how persistent people would be in asking for a heavier version, a hairline, a
    condensed, and finally a narrow version for text, and a less-condensed-than-Condensed
    version for headlines. We added these over the intervening years, and released
    them as additional products in 2009.\r\n\r\nWe also took that occasion to \"upgrade\"
    the existing Gothams, by giving them tabular figures, fractions, and extended
    monetary symbols. William's post above is correct: these additions are offered
    as a low-cost \"upgrade\" to all of our existing customers, and free to our most
    recent licensees.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the future holds for Tungsten: in part
    it depends on what people like you ask for, so feel free to let us know if you
    have any suggestions. (One person asked me on Twitter for old-style figures, which
    I never really imagined. Also, we tried a hairline, and didn't like it. And finally,
    I can assure you that \"Tungsten Swash Caps\" are not under discussion at this
    time...) For now we've turned our attention to other projects, so I hope you'll
    find today's Tungsten useful, and worth its price of $99.\r\n\r\n\r\nKindest Regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan
    Hoefler\r\n"

  body: "This is fantastic. I bought Tungsten a couple of years ago and was really
    excited to get the e-mail about the new lighter (and much needed) weights. I'll
    be upgrading as soon as I figure out how.\r\n\r\nAnd to Farquart (two years later),
    although there are certainly some typefaces that look like Tungsten (just like
    there are some typefaces that look like, well, pretty any other typeface to some
    degree or another), they don't necessarily work like Tungsten. Nothing against
    the design of other similar fonts, but Tungsten, to me, is really crafted at a
    higher level than most anything else I own. I noticed that the first time I used
    it. I'm really not interested in fonts that don't look like anything else (because
    they'd probably look so unusual that they'd be pretty unusable for general use),
    but I'm definitely interested in typefaces that take existing genres to a new
    place. "
