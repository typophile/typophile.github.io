body: "I'm currently in the process of using Microsoft VOLT to programme a Malayalam
  typeface and I have run into a few problems that I just don't understand how to
  fix. I'm currently testing my file in Microsoft Word 2010.\r\n\r\n1, Malayalam has
  glyphs known as chillaksaram which, as I understand it, are formed through inputting
  a string like this: \r\nna (\u0D28) + virama ( \u0D4D) + ZWJ [Control+Shift+1]=
  \u0D7B. \r\n\r\nWithin VOLT, I have included the relevant strings into a post-base
  substitution <pstf> lookup and feature. This lookup sits below Akhand <akhn> and
  Below-base form <blwf> lookups that I have created.\r\n\r\n2, Malayalam uses a rakar
  glyph that substitutes ra (\u0D30) + virama ( \u0D4D). The substitution itself works
  but it doesn't repositioning to precede it's base consonant. I assume this is the
  job of the shaping engine and so I do not understand what action I'm either not
  doing or preventing from happening?\r\n\r\n3, Finally, and more generally, I'm unsure
  which script I should be using; Malayalam <mlym> or Malayalam v.2 <mlm2>, or both?
  I need support for both Windows and Mac OSX systems. I often find problems that
  vary between them. I have been trying to follow closely the specifications laid
  out in Microsoft's Opentype Specification manual: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/malayalam/intro.htm\r\n\r\nHopefully
  someone can point me in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nJonny

      Thanks for your speedy response, Theunis.

  body: "Sorry not to have responded sooner; I just noticed this.\r\n\r\nThe current
    OT Malayalam spec is somewhat misleading with regard to what the shaping engine
    actually does. My guess is that eventually the shaping engine behaviour will need
    to be revised, because it's sort of broken; in the meantime, though, it is possible
    to make a Malayalam font that works reasonably well, but you have to put all conjunct
    ligature lookups in the {akhn} feature and not use the {cjct} and {pres} features
    as you would for other Indic scripts.\r\n\r\nIn response to your particular questions
    (using my conventional development glyph names):\r\n\r\n1. Chillu substitutions
    should be the first lookup in the {akhn} feature, processed before any others.
    The sequence you have is correct: letter + virama + ZWJ. Note that you might also
    want a ligature for \r\n<code>mNa mVirama ZWJ mRra -> mChilluNRra</code>\r\nwhich
    should precede the shorter chillu strings in the lookup.\r\n\r\n2. For v.2 shaping,
    the input for the prescript rakar is \r\n<code>mVirama mRa -> mRakar</code>\r\nand
    this lookup must be associated with the {pref} feature. The layout engine knows
    to reorder the output of the {pref} feature to the beginning of the cluster.\r\n\r\n3.
    You should only need to implement the Malayalam v.2 shaping and can ignore the
    older spec. The v.2 shaping is used in all versions of Windows from Vista on,
    and Malayalam is also one of the scripts for which Adobe's World Ready Composer
    implements the v.2 shaping, albeit with some bugs. [See http://www.typophile.com/node/94543
    ]\r\n\r\nMalayalam is the most difficult Indic script for which I've had to program
    in VOLT, not just because of the issues with the shaping engine and spec, but
    because the orthographic conventions of how Malayalam is written represent a subset
    of capabilities of the writing system. In modern Malayalam, conventional preference
    dictates that some conjuncts must be written with ligatures, some with subscripts,
    and some with explicit virama, while other are acceptable in more than one form.
    This means your VOLT programming needs to handle prioritisation of particular
    conjunct formation using contextual rules. So, for instance, when three letters
    occur in a conjunct, you need to know which two-letter portion of the conjunct
    takes preference as a ligature or subscript form and where an explicit virama
    should be.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I don't have this information in a form that I can
    publicly share yet."

  body: "John,\r\n\r\nOn closer inspection, I have found that my Malayalam font has
    some strange errors that don't make sense to me. Having made the alterations you
    suggested above my chillu forms substitute correctly and my rakar form now correctly
    jumps to it's correct pre-base position but now two new issues have occurred.\r\n
    \r\nAll but one of my below-base marks substitute correctly on Windows but not
    within Indesign CS6. Why only the one consonant (mLa) substitutes and not the
    others is puzzling. I'd have thought it was all or nothing?\r\n\r\nThe other issue
    is that I cannot make rakar ligatures in Windows or CS6. For example:\r\nmPa mVirama
    mRa -> mPra\r\n\r\nI've also tinkered with the strings in these ways without success:\r\n'mPa
    mRakar -> mPra' or 'mRakar mPa -> mPra\r\n\r\nI assumed they have to be held within
    the AKHN lookup because you stated above that's where all conjunct ligatures should
    be located?\r\n\r\nThe Malayalam example within the 'CS6IndicTagTest.pdf' document
    you kindly shared on Typophile shows neither below-base conjuncts or rakar ligatures
    where there is the potential for them; this suggests it's not yet possible to
    implement these within CS6 as we have previously discussed?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "I've not done very much testing of Malayalam in InDesign, so it is entirely
    possible that there are problems beyond those I noted in my earlier documentation.
    All my Malayalam work to date has been targeting Microsoft's implementation, and
    that too with the caveat that the shaping may need to change in future.\r\n\r\nYou
    are handling the below-base substitutions for consonants in the {blwf} feature,
    yes?\r\n\r\nI have to admit that subscript -La is an oddity: something I can make
    work without really understanding why it is done this way. It has its own {blwf}
    lookup (which isn't unusual, given that most of the subscripts have context exceptions),
    but then the conjunct ligatures involving subscript -La are handled subsequently
    in {blws}, rather than in the {akhn} feature with the other ligatures. I first
    noticed this in Microsoft's Kartika font, but no one at MS nor my Malayalam contact
    have been able to suggest why this might be so. I'm hoping I might get this cleared
    up when I look at the Malayalam shaping engine issues in more detail later this
    month.\r\n\r\nWhen you refer to rakar ligatures, I presume you mean traditional
    lipi forms. I've not had occasion to try to implement these, as all my Malayalam
    fonts have been for the reformed orthography. But my assumption would be that
    these substitutions would need to be performed in the {akhn} feature, before the
    {pref} feature substitutes the prescript -Ra, because the latter would trigger
    reordering by the layout engine. So I would expect (using my glyph naming conventions)\r\n\r\n<code>mPa
    \ mVirama mRa -> mPRa</code>\r\n\r\nin the {akhn} feature to work. If it doesn't
    then \r\n\r\nI can probably spare half an hour or so to look at your VOLT source,
    if that might help.\r\n\r\njohn[at]tiro[dot]ca"
