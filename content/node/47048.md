    stems; for example  A,W, M (bold)  are too spotty. The Y is  too spotty; since
    the Y is like the  X but  with  vertical stem.  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "There is a problem with the diagonals generally. They are usually about the
    cross section of the stems or less. Many of these here are fatter, which gives
    very uneven color--hence Muzzer's um extreme reaction. \r\n\r\nThe joins are also
    heavy, as David noted. In general, with bolder weights, these require more tapering
    to look good. Compare a number of fonts you admire on both the issue of diagonals
    and joins. And the main thing, IMHO, is to always look for issues of even color.
    \r\n\r\nOn your OS numbers, the 345 look way wider than the others. Also the cross
    bar on the 4 is I believe at or above the base line usually in OS numbers. \r\n\r\nI
    think the ear of the g is a bit long in the light--which doesn't have the color
    problems of the bold. But the g in the bold goes way overboard, I think. There
    are often 'g's with ears over the x-height, but this one looks out of place. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "The 2 is the most bothersome glyph to my eyes. Particularly in the oldstyle
    light and both bold versions, I think more even counters would work better. It
    also gets too fat at the bottom left - that's really the same problem with the
    angular joins that's already been noted.\r\n\r\nThe bold oldstyle 1 looks bottom-heavy.
    Maybe the bottom of the 3s sticks out too far.\r\n\r\nI think the space is too
    narrow under the dots of the i & j in the bold.\r\n"

  body: "I printed off the PDF. I'll give you some proper feedback soon-ish. Why is
    there such a big jump in weights? Is it your plan to interpolate between them?
    As they stand I think they are too far apart to be helpful to each other set in
    text.\r\n\r\nThe joins look like they need lightening v-z and even maybe the abdp
    etc. This is true for both weights. the bold w&W in particular seems overweight
    compared to the other glyphs.\r\n\r\nI might pull the ear of the g up a little
    higher at the join.\r\n\r\nThe horizonals ( top & bottom) of the CGOS seem too
    heavy in the light weight.\r\n\r\nI may amend these ideas when I have looked at
    the printed page."

  body: "Thanks for the comments!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going back and reworking the diagonals/joins
    now. I had drawn them with the same weight as the verticals\u2014way too heavy!
    The narrow joins are a symptom of the bold being based on the light, which was
    too narrow in places, so now I\u2019m redrawing those letters in both weights.
    \r\n\r\nI think I\u2019m going to dump the idea of old-style figures. I tried
    drawing a narrower set but wasn\u2019t especially happy with the result, and I\u2019m
    not sure that the proportions of gothic designs lend themselves to OSFs. I\u2019ll
    look at the OSFs Erik. S did for Akzidenz and think about ways to make them work
    in the American style\r\n\r\nEben, the extreme jump in weight was originally intended
    to allow me to interpolate the in-between weights (and drawing heavy letters was
    a fun shift from the light and my Fry\u2019s revival). But now I think that I\u2019ll
    be much better served by drawing everything out the slow(er) way\u2014after all,
    this is a learning experience! \r\n\r\nRight now my plan is to finish this round
    of revisions and then do a rough pass on a regular weight so that I can better
    establish character and sport potential problems across all three weights. Up
    till now my process revolved around just getting it done, and I should have realized
    what a stupid method of drawing a font that would be."

  body: ">The narrow joins are a symptom of the bold being based on the light\r\n\r\nAh,
    yes. If you overlay the light and bold outlines of the M and W and other diagonal
    letters in several fonts,  you will see how they have to widen the letters to
    get the joins to work. Otherwise you get the clots, as you have discovered. In
    the branches in the m and n etc the joins generally need more taper. Studying
    the clever stuff that great fonts do with different weights--and having them open
    to look at--I think you will find very helpful as you are doing the bold.  "

  body: "James I don't think it's stupid. I just wanted to check about your intention.
    Keep in mind you may want to use these to generate a middle weight and then tweak
    it too. The main thing is that the glyphs have the same # of points and that those
    points relate. Or, you could do it all by hand I guess... It depends on what you
    want, when you want it & so on. I think it might be smart to do it that way because
    if you start making more & more fonts in the future you may find learning this
    approach* is helpful. You can always tweak glyphs afterwards!\r\n\r\n*I certainly
    plan to learn it! ;-)\r\n\r\nWhat I think I would do in your shoes though is to
    make sure that one weight was quite a bit more done before you \r\n\r\na) make
    too many gyphs with acenets etc.\r\nb) worry about weights too much\r\n\r\nIn
    some ways it seems to me that generating the middle weight and then \"perfecting\"
    it might be the smartest 1st step from here. For one thing it is the middle or
    book weight that is likely to see the most use! \r\n\r\nI have read about design
    process' where they just built the far examples and telegraphed the middle design
    in from the two very far points - which sounds cool. But from a learning point
    of view sounds too tough. Also you might be like JFP and want you light & heavy
    to move in different stylistic directions that preclude generating a middle from
    two extremes. Look at his Costa & Anisette to see what I mean. \r\n\r\nI still
    haven't had time to sit down & really do this properly. I am sorry about that!"
