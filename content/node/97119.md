  did not have success, not courier nor fixedsys (ident01.png). The characters which
  were key to realized this were \"4\" and \"0\" (zero). \r\n\r\nI have also another
  image which I would like to discover which font is this, maybe some of those Courier's,
  since its \"4\" is different from the other image. See ident02.png\r\n\r\nThanks!!

    their \"Ironic\" category fonts, which are imitations of other lettering technologies.\r\n\r\n-
