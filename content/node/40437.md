  body: "Hello Mike,\r\nthanks you very much for your help.\r\nFor me its not important
    if or which digital version is existing.\r\nI always want to know for foundry,
    year of first production and artist.\r\nIts for my lead font collection:\r\nhttp://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=41\r\n\r\nWe
    printed 36 new character sets and I am scanning it through the next days (and
    nights).\r\n\r\nI'll post links here when I'm ready...\r\n\r\nFor you and all
    your beloved:\r\nStay healthy in 2008. All the best.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

  body: "Hi Georg, \r\nThe designer was Louis Oppenheim, and the year of the original
    design was 1913. This weight matches the Lo-Type Light face, but I had no idea
    there was a Light Italic. \r\n\r\nI know you aren't interested in the digital
    versions, but there is a <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/lo-type-be/medium-italic/charmap.html?vid=321939&cpselect=CP4\">Medium
    Italic</a> digital version that is interesting for comparison to your sample.
    I'm looking forward to your more complete sample of this italic. Would you mind
    if I include it in my Serif Font ID Guide?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    its not a must, just a question...\r\n\r\nThank you very much again for your support.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Antiqua_ks_unbekannt_marked_6695.jpg]"
