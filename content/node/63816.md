body: "This may be a long shot, but at our studio we have a dingbat like font called
  \ \"form\" and it contains these interesting 3d looking geometric shapes. I am assuming
  it was at one point downloaded from somewhere or something (no one can remember).
  We are trying to find out where it came from and if there is any more like maybe
  a \"Form2\". That would be ideal. If not, if you know of anything similar, suggestions
  would be appreciated. I did check on DaFont and there is some decent stuff, but
  not quite what we were looking for, the 3d/complex aspect is pretty important for
  this.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help you are willing to give. "

  body: "Thank you so much Miss Tiffany. That was immensely helpful, I figured there
    must be a way to look at that kind of info, but was not sure. So it is a font
    by T26 called Form and there isn't a \"form2\" but thats ok =(. \r\n\r\nThanks
    so much again. "
