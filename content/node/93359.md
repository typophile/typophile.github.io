body: did anyone know what font is this? i already asked this few years ago, someone
  said it was 'Didot'. but recently, i just knew that the type used for this parfume
  is NOT Didot. the Q is different, so can someone put a light on this?

    has been bastardised to accommodate the second line of the logotype. \r\n\r\nI
    happen to know that they have form for this.\r\n\r\nTim"
