  new to this forum but was thinking that you folks might be able to help me.\r\n\r\nWould
  you by any chance know what fonts are used for \"FOODIE\" and \"TEXAS FLAVOR\" on
  this flyer? (Two different fonts, of course).\r\n\r\nAny feedback you might have
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks very much,\r\nJoe\r\n"

  body: The two 'A's in TEXAS FLAVOR are slightly different, making this a good candidate
    for hand lettering. It is my bet, as I haven't seen either style as a font before.
