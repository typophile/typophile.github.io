  to elderkin bold.\r\nElderkin has been discontinued. It looks like Helvetica Bold
  Condensed but it has slightly rounded corners.\r\nThis gives it a punched leather/
  woodcut feel.\r\n\r\nIt was used on the cover of the Annual of Type Directors Club
  26.\r\n\r\nAny fonts that are similar would be great. I have a tight deadline and
  would prefer to not have to recreate something."
