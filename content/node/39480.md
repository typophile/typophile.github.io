  body: "\"BTW, how many characters would require a typeface for a major language
    in India?\"\r\n\r\nWell it differs from language to language, but nowhere near
    as complex as the languages of the Far East.\r\n\r\nFor the Devangari script which
    is the basis of most northern Indian languages, and therefore the most widely
    used, it should be around under 90 characters including numerals accents, ligatures
    etc. But I must admit I'm no expert on Devanagari.\r\n\r\nIn the 70s and 80s many
    Indian languages, including the one I speak, went through script reforms mainly
    to rationalize the number of characters and make them viable on typewriters. With
    recent advances in language technology, there are moves to return to earlier schemes
    which had far more characters (and I must add character:). "

    that a good font for Devanagari literary texts could have 800 characters, 300

    compound characters. I know that's the case with Malayalam, a Dravidian language
    spoken in south of the country. We had about 900 characters which in the reformed
    script was brought down to less than a hundred largely by doing away with the
    need for compound characters. \r\n\r\nI can read and write Sankrit and Hindi -
    both Languages that use Devanagari - tolerably well. I really don't think there
    are 800, or for that matter 300 unique characters in use today. \r\n\r\nBut like
    I said I'm not an expert on Devanagari, or a typeface designer. If you've been

  body: "For years, starting about 1988 I pestered people toward getting a good digital
    version of Linotype Monticello. & For most of those years I was laughed at and
    told no one would buy it. Or I was met with uncomprehending stares from the many
    people who had never heard of it.\r\n\r\nThanks to Princeton University Press
    and its Thomas Jefferson papers project, we now have a very nice Monticello, created
    by Matthew Carter.\r\n\r\nOver the past ten years or so, though, I have become
    much less interested in \"revivals\" of older faces. As James Puckett suggests
    above, rather let us encourage typeface designers to start anew, to create types
    go beyond \"revivals.\" In book types [at least for setting English] it may be
    argued that it will be tough to do anything wholly \"new.\" Basic forms are set,
    and both readers and typographers have expectations from text types. But recent
    work from folks such as Kent Lew and Stefan Hattenbach shows that standard forms
    can be subtly adjusted and re-worked to make new types that both meet those expectations
    and present us with intelligent variations on the model.\r\n\r\nI for one do not
    care how closely any revival of, say, a Garamond model or a Caslon model hews
    to any particular earlier Garamond or Caslon. This is a fruitless quest. & any
    resulting face will be the subject of many gaseous arguments about how close it
    is to the \"true\" model. Why should anyone care about that? What I want is a
    face of robust color for offset printing, and one that makes full use of the technologies
    for both creating and using the new fonts.\r\n\r\nThat said, as soon as someone
    comes up with a really good version of Electra, I shall want it. Electra fills
    a unique typographic niche. Nothing since has come close, and all digital versions
    are purely watered down; I shall not use them. But there are times when I have
    wished for it.\r\n\r\npowers"

    Do graphic designers and typographers ever imagine non-existing fonts? I guess
    yes as this is one of the reasons why typefaces are commissioned. My question
    is if you ever think of something quite specific that is not a revival.\r\n\r\n(Years
    ago I had a very specific image of a sans typeface in my mind. Then Joshua Darden's
    Freight Sans was released - and it's a 90% match of what I had imagined. Now,
    someone will tease me to death because of another thread on lowercase a, but I

    the holy grail of 'authenticity' is misguided. In the case of Caslon, this was
    attempted by the late Justin Howe, but the metal type he used included 19th century
    recuttings of Caslon, as well as some damaged old type. He also digitized his
    face based on his modern prints from the metal types, and the result is much lighter
    than 18th century or even most later letter press printing of Caslon. The result
    in my view is good for an 'antique' look, but not so good for general use. \r\n\r\nMy
