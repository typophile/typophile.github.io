  body: Well, back to the original question. <BR>I think the smaller text will be
    easier to ID from a larger scan if it is possible to get one. <BR> <BR>From where
    I am viewing this it could look like the &#34;Familles Gay &amp; Pestalozzi&#34;

  body: hehehe <BR> <BR>Yes all of that is clearly handlettered. <BR> <BR>I suggest
    you might leaf through a few of  <BR>these pages. Maybe there is something suitable.

    <BR>or take a look at Mike&#39;s <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html">Script
    Font Identification Guide</a> <BR>it is packed with examples.
