    I just don't know any other way to ask you this question. \r\n\r\nIn a forum,
    26. May 2006 about the Kunstgewerbeschule Basel you asked: \"Also, was Frank Vigliotti
    there then as well?\"\r\n\r\nI was a friend of Frank in the late sixties and early
    seventies in Basel but have lost touch years ago. Are you still in touch or do
    you know someone who is?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nMartin\r\n\r\nMartin_Suter@mac.com
