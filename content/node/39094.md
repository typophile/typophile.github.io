body: "\r\n I am currently working on a kinetic identity for a non profit org in my
  vis com class and I have chosen 'flint club'.\r\n This organization basically promotes
  prosperity and connecting people in the downtown flint/michigan area by hosting
  various events. \r\n \r\n The logo itself depicts an arche. There are seven arches
  that had been erected in the early 1900s that covered different streets in the downtown
  area that also lit the roads at night. They are iconic and i have decided to exploit
  them in the logo. \r\n\r\nI almost want to approach this logo in a more tangible
  form to better relate to the kinetic identiy system, some type of material i can
  use to enforce the idea of the hard working/blue collar, grounded city. I just cant
  think of anything, help? comments?\r\n\r\nmany thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n- JR"

  body: Does the current mark mimic the shape of the arches? Are the arches architecturally
    interesting enough to mimic? The left version seems a little too much and the
    right almost not enough. Although if the mark is simple it won't ever compete
    with any other work around it.

  body: "I'm not sure what you mean by \"kinetic identity system\".  What you're showing
    is pretty static and singular.  Do you intend multiple versions?  Subbrands that
    vary through color or other relationship?  \r\n\r\nWhat you've shown so far are
    only 2 very simple iterations.  If I were your teacher, I'd expect to see considerably
    more work.  Now, maybe you've done that and are only showing us your most promising
    directions. If that's the case, then you need to push yourself harder.  I get
    the concept of the arches, but I don't see a unique expression that relates to
    Flint.  Maybe that's why you're looking for something more tangible, like materials,
    to bring into the system.  That's a fine idea, but you've got to nail down the
    graphic expression first.  Explore what can make this identity unique to Flint
    and you'll be a bit closer to a better logo."

  body: Do you plan on animating these somehow? Maybe through use of lenticular or
    holographic technology on the print side? They're nice enough institutional logos,
    but if they want something kinetic you'll have to show a storyboard at least.

  body: As for materials, there must be a laser and/or hydrojet cutter shop somewhere
    in your area. They can fabricate a custom cut design in anything from cotton batting
    to half-inch thick steel plate from an Adobe Illustrator file.

  body: "Jonsel;  thank you much for your input, great advice. I have done a considerable
    amount of work and have narrowed it down to this last look i've shown you all,
    however I agree with you that I do need to nail down a better graphical expression
    that relates uniquley to Flint. You almost seem familiar with flint or the idea
    of a working class/ motor type city, have any inclination of materials or graphic
    language i could use for the logo and supporting graphics? I would much appreciate
    your tips advice on that. \r\n\r\nCuttlefish; thank you as well for your advice.
    Im with you too, I feel its very institutional(ish), which is fine, but not the
    direction I would like to go. I want something that is now, but has somre feel
    of footing and has lasting appeal. \r\n\r\nThank you both and I hope to get even
    more advice from you both on direction, materials i can look into, and designs,
    heck, even links resources i can check into.\r\n\r\n Thanks again both of you
    and i look forward to hearing back from you both. By the way hit me up in ichat:
    \ missmyext\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\njoe"
