  looking for the right typeface for my project, with little to no luck. I've scoured
  all over the internet and up and down the forums here. Maybe you can help me out
  in this topic.\r\n\r\nI'm seeking a typeface that is made with the style of a dry
  brush. To clarify, I want a typeface with some rough streaks in it, that would be
  created from uneven coating of the hairs / bristles of a brush.\r\n\r\nTypophile
  user Hiroshige has created something very, very close to what I'm looking for, but
  he hasn't expanded upon it in a typeface. You can view his topic here, but I've
  posted the images below. http://typophile.com/node/33070\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/h_x06_6175_3868.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/o_x06_5679_6290.JPG]\r\n\r\nSome
  similar typefaces I've discovered that aren't quite sophisticated enough are:\r\n\r\nITC
  Atmosphere[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Atmosphere_4387.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nScandal[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Scandal_6259.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Seven_6418.gif]\r\n\r\nI'd
  really appreciate any feedback you have for me. I'm dying to find a typeface similar
  to this. It's been one of those days ...\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSean"

  body: Thanks so much Stephen, but all of those don't seem to have the detail and
    exact brush texture that Hiroshige and Seven have. You know what I mean? They
    look too perfect and digitized.

    \u2026 that might be because they <em>are</em> digitized! Get yourself a brush!

    you would be dealing with. If it''s only for display use, I would actually really
    consider lettering it yourself or ask someone to do it. '
