    gold (yellow) occasionally with conservative parties. But very subtle. Socialist
    parties stick with good ol\u2019 red of course. Showing off national symbols has
    been a problem in Germany until maybe recently with the football (soccer for the
    U.S.) world championship in 2006, because of our history. I think even countries
