		<div class="commentbody">My analysis isn't expert, but you asked for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For me, the unique character of the serifs in Avance doesn't lie in their asymmetry, half serif designs have been around (I can't name any, I'm sure the veterans can help me out here), but rather the unique character lies in the flaring sides of the stem opposite the serif. This brings some of the feel of an italicized face to the type without giving it a measurable slant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even though the stems of glyphs have no slant, some glyphs seem to express a slight slant of a few degrees. The outer outline of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->o<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seems to have this slant, while the counter is nearly vertically upright. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->c<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->e<!-- raw HTML omitted --> share a large part of their outer edge with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->o<!-- raw HTML omitted --> glyph, with the same slant. The upper arm of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->c<!-- raw HTML omitted --> even extends further right than the bottom arm, emphasizing the slant. The left side of the lower chamber of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->g<!-- raw HTML omitted --> extends further to the left than the top chamber, drawing this slant. Unlike most fonts, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> doesn't retract its arms narrower than its loops in an effort to find balance, but instead adopts a slight lean. This effort to show slope extends to the upper case, in particular in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->G<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->B<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, whose upper arm and loop respectively extend further right than conventionally. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have a problem with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> glyph. Its curved stem looks great when the glyph stands alone, but composed in text it feels like it's trying to squirm away. It doesn't share the same serif structure that the other stems do, but this doesn't mean it shouldn't march to the same rhythm. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->g<!-- raw HTML omitted --> glyph is also too dark. It weighs down the words in which it participates. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The size that the Daidala archives were set in works well on the screen (though I suspect this is because the text is gray), but feels too large when printed. The contrast is so even that it feels heavy around 11pt. I found it much more pleasant to read at something like 8pt. Then again, I have young eyes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like this font, especially for the shape of the upper case. The conventional design of the upper case serif alphabet has been so regularized that it looks identical in so many different fonts. Avance brings the upper case a fresh feel that takes advantage of our expanded tolerance for experimentation in this post-emigre era.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting analysis. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; half serif designs have been around <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Actually, it's surprising how few there are. Meier has a couple, but they're way too calligraphic, and don't have any &quot;counterweighting&quot; like Avance does, so they lean backwards - very distracting. The French seem to do it sometimes: Mandel has one, and it's pretty cool; JFP has Angie, and Thierry Puyfoulhoux has Cicero, but those two don't have enough serifs, they're more like a sans with instrokes. Then there's Rotis Semi-Serif, but it also has too few serifs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Avance, and Burke's recent Parable are the only two that I would personally use for text. Wait, I'd also use my Harrier (basically the Latin &quot;subordinate&quot; of my Nour), but I don't think anybody else would&hellip;  :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; flaring sides <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was fortunate to get to know Evert during the ATypI-Boston conference (thanks Phan, wherever you are), and he showed me Avance (called something else back then, I think), around a year before FontFont started selling it. As his explanation for Avance on the FF site might indicate, he needed to see the reason for serifs before incorporating them into his work, and at first he just put them plainly on the top-left and bottom-right ends of strokes/elements. But then he realized they were leaning backwards&hellip; and he started wrestling with the possible solutions. He decided to add those flares to balance things. As for myself, in Harrier, I wanted to avoid the soft femininity of flares, so instead I slanted the whole thing forward as gently as possible: 1/16 = ~3.58 degrees. Interestingly, some famous slanted fonts (like Unger's Flora and Gill's Joanna Italic) use an angle close to that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This makes your observations of slight slanting in some glyphs very relevant. How much of it was intentional, I wonder. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The g glyph is also too dark <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Huh, I hadn't noticed that. But it's very slight. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What might have helped is an open bottom. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; feels heavy around 11pt. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, Avance is a chunky friendly face - in fact a bit too cloying for my tastes*. The huge x-height makes it work better at small sizes. This is most apparent in the book &quot;John Kelly&quot;, where Avance is used (with no credit anywhere&hellip;) for the titles, text and captions, and it's in this last usage where it shines the most. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Which doesn't dampen my ideological admiration for it: I think it's a landmark work, the most significant entry in the FF library. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Avance brings the upper case a fresh feel <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Latin UC set is so paradoxical: it's so much better balanced than the lc set, but it's also less readable, and used for only about 5% of text. It's a very tricky decision what to do with it: make it conform to the lc*, make it it's own thing, or something in the middle. Pragmatism dictates that the last option would be the best, but I personally haven't been able to pull that off yet (and I actually don't think Avance does either - although maybe it doesn't even try), so I've reverted to the second option. (I'm talking structurally - matching the finish is easy). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* BTW, I've always thought Uncial caps are better. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On to Sonoma&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks a lot for the Icone scan. I do remember seeing it, but in this context I'm struck by the resemblance to Avance - even the cuddliness. A French type designer once told me that Bloemsma really admires Excoffon's work (and by extension French type design in general?), but he didn't mean it in a nice way, and I reject that (even though I admire the flying French playboy myself). But there's certainly some parallel evolution there - compare FF Balance to Olive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Hope you didn't choke on that &quot;ductus&quot; there. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yeah, it's a good thing I'd already finished by chocolate donut&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's what's paradoxical about the semi-serif: even designers who are dedicated to chirographic type don't seem to implement them.

		<div class="commentbody">I know for a fact that Linotype have outlines for Icone, so there is no need to revive it: you just have to create a demand for it. There are probably lots of typefaces out there in digital limbo: halfway between photo or early computer typesetting and today's formats. Ikarus data probably exists for most of the typefaces developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Sometimes the Ikarus digitisation was done hurriedly, or a bad IK-&gt;PS conversion done, so the outlines would require a lot of clean-up and comparison to printed samples from earlier technology, which explains why some designs have not been released yet. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since Adrian Frutiger is still alive and Icone is owned by Linotype, 'reviving' it would not be ethical.

If I would be forced to choose two text-aimed faces from the FontShop library I would probably choose the basic Quadraat by Fred Smejers and Balance by Bloemsma. Anyway there are many great text faces. We're so used to Meta that we are no longer able to see how nice it works. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking at old I.D. Magazine issues I remember how simple and good the design was, using mostly Meta and Joanna. They just did too many weights of Meta. Endless Italic Small Caps sets are the most absurd thing in the FontShop library. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But probably I'm just against the abuse of beautiful text faces in advertising&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sure. But it will not happen. Balance defies expectations and people tend to buy mostly what looks &quot;safer&quot; for corporate identity abuse. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I hope Balance continues to sell. One day or the other I will buy it. For now I have Quadraat (a nice gift from FontShop in exchange for a small article I wrote in Tribe for Max Kisman).</div>
