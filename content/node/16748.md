    in the tradition of \"crash numbering\". Psy/ops has a good revival:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.psyops.com/html/library_crash.html\r\n\r\n"

    used a font that's not simply available as a commercial typeface. Yaknow, like,
    to make forging money a <em>little</em> harder. ;^)\r\n\r\n<em>And don\u2019t

    identify in the past: type on passports, identity cards from various countries,
    bank cheques, credit cards, all kinds of serial numbers... It <em>does</em> leave
    you wondering what all these people need that information for. You'll have to
    excuse us for getting a little suspicious whenever we get such a request. Especially
    when the person requesting that infomation decides to stay anonymous and signs
    up as \"zzzz\"... No offense. :^)"
