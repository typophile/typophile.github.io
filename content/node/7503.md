    ALT="factory3.gif"> <BR> <BR>While I was building factory I started to manufacture
    fonts based on the factory template. I was thinking of all the small foundries
    that are doing retro/tech fonts. This exercise started out as a parody, but there&#39;s
    some super cool stuff. Some are more successful than others. In this case, the
    process interests me as much as the product. <BR> <BR>Click here for More &#62;

    side a straight line like the <BR>&#34;G&#34; &amp; &#34;O&#34;. other than that
    i dig all the different <BR>styles you have give this one face. lets see more,

    the basis for the C, G, O, Q and maybe even the E. i really like the Y in the
    space girl version. <BR>and yes, numbers and scandinavian characters would indeed
    be interesting to look at. '

    first. Dare I say an internet first?   <BR>&#40;Ahem, offering the actual face
    for download and testing.&#41;   <BR>I guess it shouldn&#39;t surprise me that
    it&#39;s coming from you.  <BR>  <BR>It was with this in mind that we created
    the &#34;Build&#34;   <BR>critique in the <a href="http://typophile.com/needs/your/support/">&#34;Ascenders&#34;
    membership</a> class. The goal   <BR>is to create an area where font files are
    made available  <BR>for testing by trusted peers as faces get developed. '

  body: Hmm. For some reason the board wanted to add a <BR><i>.unk</i> extension to
    this file. After downloading it, I  <BR>changed the extension to <i>.sit</i> and
    was able to  <BR>open the archive without a problem.

  body: I like it a lot, Christian. It has a very Obey Giant feel for me, but that&#39;s
    not a bad thing at all. The   &#34;Factory Serif Slim&#34; is too Chank for me,
    however. The main face is pretty cool and I think you should go that route, very
    industrial, cyrillic-esque.
