  body: ' These glyps are certainly done well, but it seems like there are a lot of
    faces of this kind, most of them done during the Carson heyday. The &#39;O&#39;
    is distinctive. I like it. The face itself needs something else to modernize it
    for 2002 and distance it from 1997. Just an opinion. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: " \a?sign was implemented into what is shown, a de-construction of ornate
    frames. This is de-construction type and I think it works for the usage. As much
    as I love the similar typefaces that came out in the mid-late 90&#39;s, I agree
    it is slightly dated.This was a good insight and much appreciated. I will need
    to re-think the design as a whole if I work it into a full type face. "

    that to this. &#39;What if&#39; I took this &#39;terminal-mix&#39; concept and
    did this to...an OCR style face, or a bauhaus face, etc. etc. <BR> <BR>Shazam!
