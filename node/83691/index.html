The premise was to design a typeface where every glyph was unique to the typeface.

What a great theory for a dyslexic font!
Should I release it with the name Dyslexia?

<p>Anyway, Dr Rob Hillier has done quite a lot of interesting research into this field, and designed a typeface for dyselics called Sylexiad. The less generous among us may say &lsquo;wow, this is hideous&rsquo; but then, that&rsquo;s hardly the point &hellip;</p>

<p>But it is.
It stigmatizes the abnormal with ugliness, to put it bluntly.
Furthermore, it assumes that there is no readability benefit in a professionally polished (which you deride as &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;) execution.
And it privileges the idea that good intentions trump mere functionality—i.e. there may be many already existing typefaces, designed with other criteria than readability for dyslexics, that would perform just as well if not better, but the scientist with the funding to make a New Font For The Reading Challenged can conveniently ignore those.</p>
<p>Jason Smith has shown that it is possible to have the best of both worlds, with Fontsmith&rsquo;s Mencap typeface.</p>

<p>Not meaning to come over all &lsquo;form follows function&rsquo;, but our notions of what is ugly or beautiful shouldn&rsquo;t come into it if it helps someone to read (and perhaps, not being able to read effectively is more stigmatizing than being lumbered with an ugly typeface?).</p>
<p>Nick, you&rsquo;re right - the Mencap typeface is beautiful, but it addresses a completely different issue (learning disability vs dyslexia), and it does not address the &lsquo;needs&rsquo; of a dyslexic readership (if we are to agree that a typeface can do this anyway).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about designers ignoring the tried-and-tested (i.e. for non-dyslexic audiences) formula - the research suggests that there is a fundamental need for characters to not follow conventional lines - ruling out most typefaces already in existence.</p>
<p>I was being deliberately glib when I derided pretty execution, of course there&rsquo;s no reason why these shouldn&rsquo;t be professional and polished (and yes, even beautiful) typefaces. But we&rsquo;re all looking at them from a different perspective.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em> - the research suggests that there is a fundamental need for characters to not follow conventional lines - ruling out most typefaces already in existence.</em></p>
<p>Not the research, the theory.
The theory argues against symmetrical and transformably-identical shapes in simple sans serifs.
But there are gazillions of typefaces which already follow that principle (it&rsquo;s inherent in the traditional chirographic, serifed oldstyle), which have not been researched or tested.
In the mass, already existing typefaces can hardly be called conventional. One would expect they follow a bell curve of conventionality. Quite apart from most typefaces in existence, there are a substantial number that might be appropriate.</p>
<p>If I was designing a typeface for this readership from scratch, I would experiment with clean shapes, then varying asymmetric distribution of weight, and with various arrangements of &ldquo;some serifs&rdquo; (e.g. as in TheMix).</p>
<p>But has anyone ever tested TheMix for readability?
No, they test Arial, and then take off on their own tangent.</p>
<p>As Thomas says, what about the humanist sans faces?
Compared with Arial, they are unconventional.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When we&rsquo;re putting it down as &ldquo;ugly&rdquo;, though, we&rsquo;re also putting it down as ignoring some of the principles of typography that have been developed over centuries. I want to avoid a semantics argument, but it&rsquo;s my understanding that the primary concern of this typeface is legibility — the ability to distinguish between individual letterforms. The researchers who developed Dyslexie decided that the best way to do this is to emphasize the differences between characters, rather than make them follow the same rational construction. However, they accomplished this by applying the warp tool to a rationally constructed neo-grotesque</p>
<p>Many of the principles they &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; to aid legibility have been used by type designers for centuries, just more subtly. What we&rsquo;re arguing is that Dyslexie and other psychologist-developed typefaces do not accomplish their goals any better than many humanist typefaces do, and when a typeface has no sense of balance (as Dyslexie does not), then it loses readability — i.e. the ability to read it over long periods of time without experiencing eye fatigue.</p>

I can&rsquo;t speak for all of those with dyslexia, but this has been my experience. Third, this theory is flawed. I don&rsquo;t care how much of the alphabet someone has behind their name, their theory is incomplete, at best. The determining factor is how a child is taught to read. That is the direction research should take. But, if we must make a font we think will help children with dyslexia learn how to cope with the printed word, please, let&rsquo;s make it one that has some aesthetic appeal. As dyslexics we have our wires crossed. We are not blind or stupid.</p>

<p>With that amount of research, all they could do is mutilate Arial in a font editor? That&rsquo;s the lazy way out. Like many others in the thread, I think something can be made — for that group of dyslexics who suffer from the symptoms stated in the Twente University research — that is both more legible for dyslexics <em>and</em> more attractive as a design. As Nick says, &ldquo;It stigmatizes the abnormal with ugliness, to put it bluntly.&rdquo; I think it can be done better.</p>
<p>(Note that I&rsquo;m not throwing myself into the mix: I am a decorative designer, focused more on beauty as a function than legibility as the sole goal. I&rsquo;m not a technical researcher. I like researching by throwing things out there and seeing what sticks.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Function never trumps aesthetics. Aesthetics is about appropriate design. Not pretty design.</p>
<p>When it comes to type, literacy, readability and legibility, ugliness is very much a factor. What do we really mean by ugly anyhow? (Who even asks that question?) With type, it surely isn&rsquo;t just the opposite of &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;. Good design stopped being about decorating functional things with flowery doodads a about a century ago.</p>
<p>Aesthetics have a real function. It isn&rsquo;t just about making things pretty. It is about making them work. There are things which, on a fundamental level, are either ugly or attractive which just about everyone in the world would agree are either ugly or attractive. What is the reason for that? I think it is something hard wired into the brain and is part of how we make sense of the world around us (in a similar way we use analogies like &ldquo;Hardwired&rdquo;). A tidy room is more attractive than a messy one because it works. You can find a place to sit down for starters. If you say you prefer messy rooms, that probably means you like the rooms you yourself have made messy because you understand the order things are in and they feel more like they belong to you after you&rsquo;ve imposed you own &ldquo;order&rdquo;.</p>
<p><cite>If </cite>the disambiguation of characters in the font this thread is about is helpful to anyone, imagine how helpful it would be if it wasn&rsquo;t achieved in such a sloppy manner.</p>
<p>Where and for what would this font be used? And how often? Will there be some sort of literary ghetto for dyslexics where they all get to read like &ldquo;normal people&rdquo; thanks to science, but will unfortunately be even worse off when faced with the other 99.999% of printed matter that will still be set in traditional fonts because they will look strange to them? Or, will &ldquo;normal people&rdquo; have their reading abilities degraded by being forced to read only this stuff? Will packaging in Canada be printed in English, French and Dyslexic?</p>
<p>I think that &lsquo;science&rsquo; as applied to typography is way off the mark 82% of the time. People expect to be able to design a magic bullet in the form of typeface to solve some problem that may in the end have nothing to do with typefaces per se. Seems to me that it&rsquo;s a matter of processing more than what&rsquo;s being processed. Perhaps some of the time it is a question of how children are taught to read. I can remember having a very difficult time telling the difference between &lsquo;b&rsquo; and &rsquo;d'. (and this was equally true with my own hand writing (printing) as with my Dick and Jane readers, so right off the bat, I say the whole thing smells like BS) I was a kid with an active imagination. After giving up on trying to read an assignment, but still staring at the page to look busy, I&rsquo;d start making up stories about the letters on the page. They really were characters. I saw that &lsquo;B&rsquo; and &lsquo;b&rsquo; face the same way but the the &rsquo;d' faces the opposite direction than &ldquo;D&rdquo;, his &ldquo;parent. Little &rsquo;d' was a rebel. Could pick <cite>him</cite> out in a crowd&hellip; And that&rsquo;s one little strategy I came up with. Certainly not anything ground breaking. It&rsquo;s just a personal anecdote about how I got over a hurdle. But, it is an example of a different approach to disambiguation that doesn&rsquo;t require such an ugly-arsed font. (It would seem I should have done very well indeed in grade school, what with all those mimeographed homework assignments. They must have been a breeze to read through.)</p>
<p>Maybe it is as simple as not using a font as devoid of character as Arial or Helvetica, as was suggested earlier, but we may never know. Why is it that folks with next to no knowledge of typography and design apparently prefer go out and invent new wheels that try and understand the ones that are already here.</p>
<p>So, I ask again&hellip; Can dyslexics read hand written (printed) text any better than Arial? It certainly doesn&rsquo;t suffer from the same lack of distinction between characters as Arial. Right?</p>

<p>Yes, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that aesthetics and functional design are one and the same.</p>
<p>A thing can look ugly because it was put together in a hurry and still work.</p>
<p>And something can look beautiful and not work - and that is changed not one whit because fashions have changed from rococo to Swedish Modern.</p>
<p>Aesthetics deals with what we see on the outside, and function has to do with what&rsquo;s doing the work on the inside. The inner workings of many mechanical devices do have a functional beauty, but for functional reasons - keeping dust out of the gears - they&rsquo;re still covered.</p>
<p>The typeface for dyslexics under discussion does indeed seem to have been thrown together quickly. A typeface could have its characteristics and still also look more like a conventional typeface - for example, there seems no reason to dispense with serifs. But the asymmetries that the function requires likely <em>will</em> compromise the attractiveness of a typeface somewhat, even so.</p>
<p>@russelm:
<cite>Or, will &ldquo;normal people&rdquo; have their reading abilities degraded by being forced to read only this stuff? Will packaging in Canada be printed in English, French and Dyslexic?</cite></p>
<p>I suspect that the goal would be to have textbooks in the elementary grades all be printed in dyslexic-safe type, so that dyslexia would no longer compromise the process of learning to read for its victims.</p>
<p>Once they have learned to read well, then problems with the shapes of individual letters would no longer obtrude, since they would be reading whole words rather than making out one letter at a time to try to sound out what word they are seeing.</p>

<p>Barking up the wrong tree. The fundamental geometry that makes it possible to confuse a &lsquo;b&rsquo; with a &rsquo;d' (for example) remains the same. It&rsquo;s possible for a kid to confuse the two letters in his own hand writing. How is a font with some randomly generated irregularities any an improvement? Having been there, I don&rsquo;t believe there is any merit at all in this approach.  Some paradigm shifting required.</p>
<p>I very much doubt that improvements in reading accuracy (if any in actuality) due to the disambiguation of letters has anything what soever to do with the ugliness of the font. That is just sloppiness, which comes across to me and, I hope to other people, if they take a second to think about it, as a sign of disrespect and condescension in the very same way that the well meaning people who supplied those appalling orthopedic shoes of days gone by figured &ldquo;gimpy&rdquo; kids are &ndash; Well, they&rsquo;re &ldquo;gimpy&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t <cite>need</cite> attractive footwear. The same effect (of each letter being distinct from others) could have been achieved in a decently designed font - And largely it has been achieved in a very large number of existing fonts, including many of those in text books used to teach children to read (though now-a-days, that isn&rsquo;t always the case. Most of the text books and workbooks  kids are given by their schools these days are absolute crap. That anyone could learn to read from them is remarkable. Children are exposed to so many appallingly badly designed and written text books and workbooks in schools that is a real shame on our generation.)</p>

<cite>How is a font with some randomly generated irregularities any an improvement?</cite></p>
<p>Well, it is true that the irregularities would have to be the same in all reading material. So one typeface, or one family of typefaces, would presumably have to be used in <em>all</em> the textbooks used in the early grades, until students master reading.</p>
<p>The idea isn&rsquo;t simply &ldquo;use Typeface X&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;change the fundamental letterforms in the alphabet&rdquo;, so that the irregularities of the Dyslexie font are added to the definition of &ldquo;what makes a b&rdquo; and &ldquo;what makes a d&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since dyslexia isn&rsquo;t a problem where the Chinese writing system is used, a writing system reform for countries using the Latin alphabet would presumably be effective in eliminating dyslexia as a problem in those countries. Thus, I have to presume that writing system reform, at least in effect, and not simply an &ldquo;orthopedic&rdquo; typeface, is the goal here.</p>

<p>Just a small difference in perception. In china they call it idiocy. Idiots are idiots. you can&rsquo;t help them, hence it&rsquo;s not a problem worthy of investigation.</p>

The articles you cited, which do show that a condition analogous to dyslexia exists within the Chinese linguistic community, also note that that condition is distinct from what we know as dyslexia, because it involves a deficit in a different part of the brain.</p>
<p>The two conditions should not be given the same name; that is a violation of specific etiology, a useful rule for defining medical conditions, because the cure for a disease usually depends strongly upon its cause.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dyslexia is something which is studied by medical researchers in order to find its cause and its treatment. It is currently believed that it may be a genetic disorder. It is recognized as a learning disability.</p>
<p>Thus, if treatment and cure were possible, they would be desirable. To find these, however, a specific cause is required, so specific etiology is applicable.</p>
<p>Of course, blindness is a disability, but it has many causes; if the term dyslexia is applied generally to all reading disorders, not merely to the best-known one, the one involving parity-reversals of glyphs, and there are many reading disorders, and there is a need for a general term, the point that it &ldquo;is not a disease&rdquo; has validity, and new terms would be needed for the different medical conditions that are lumped together under that term.</p>
<p>The purpose of language is to communicate data about the real world, so as to coordinate human activities effectively, whether medical research or hunting. Compromising that purpose in order to make people feel good is not a good idea.</p>
<p>Although, admittedly, social interaction is another ancient purpose for language.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ Matthew Dixon : &ldquo;aesthetics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are completely missing the point, or perhaps you didn&rsquo;t read the second sentence you quoted? By my definition, function is not actually separate from aesthetics. A lovely looking beauty of a tractor that can&rsquo;t pull shyte is really only a beauty of a tractor if the point of the tractors design is something other than pulling shyte.</p>
<p>I am talking about aesthetics at a more basic &amp; fundamental level than surface decoration. You or I may think a thing, i.e., a font, is ugly or attractive, but why do we think that? Why does your brain think that.  What is going on in there from an evolutionary perspective.  Yes, you live in a culture and therefore have acquired the tastes of that culture. However, broadly speaking, all people agree to a great extent on what is attracting and what is ugly (repellent). Why? If you can answer that question then I think you will have to agree, aesthetics are an aspect function and have a function to you as an organism and as a member of a society. If he function of a good hair-doo is to make you look sexy and the end result is that look and feel sexy, the the design is successful on all levels. It has a function. My definition and understanding includes the the fact that the lovely spinning gears in a machine are covered by safety guides&hellip; I used to be a welder. I actually made safety guards for truly magnificent and very rapidly spinning gears on industrial equipment that could rip a person&rsquo;s arm off if left exposed, so I appreciate better than most people here that taken as a whole safety guards improve the aesthetics of machines no matter how nice the inner Workings are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone has any issues with designing things to improve the lives of people who need, or could benefit from special accommodations. That isn&rsquo;t the point either. Why agree to ramps that are the result of some vague good intention or the begrudging compliance to building codes when you can have something that <cite>actually</cite> improves life for some people without making it worse for others.</p>
<p>In the building some of my relatives live in, the management installed a prefabricated aluminum ramp down the steps from the front door to the lobby. It takes up half the width stairs and about a third of the floor space of the lobby. It may or may not conform to the letter of the building code (depending on where you put you measuring tape), but certainly not to the intent of it. There is built-in planter between the ramp&rsquo;s railing and the elevator, with the result that the gap between them is narrower than what the ADA says is needed for wheel chairs. Not to mention the added dangers to kids, the elderly and clumsy people from all the sharp metal angles on the structure, the loud discordant banging and clanging from kids playing on it and the affect the eyesore in the lobby will have on their property values. This so called solution to a problem has made life worse for everyone in the building, including those it was intended to help. The real solution would have been a built-in ramp. it would have cost more, but there is tax money for this kind of stuff, and it&rsquo;s amortized over the life of the building, so so what. Cost isn&rsquo;t an issue. Actual functionality is.</p>
<p>Putting shyte out there, well intended or otherwise, and declaring a problem solved is just disrespectful of process and end users and should not be defended or tolerated. In my very humble but generally correct opinion.</p>
<p>I am not anti-science by any stretch. There is, however simply too much shoddy science being done for anyone to just accept something like this simply because it&rsquo;s authors have letters behind their names. The main ingredient in any PhD is persistence. Not intelligence. Read the feckin papers for Christ sake. Scales will fall from your eyes.</p>
<p>I think the whole premise behind this font is wrong and that they proceeded without sufficient knowledge of typography, how reading works and common sense. It is very easy to simply (and even unintentionally) ask the wrong questions or to telegraph desired responses to participants, resulting in skewed results in favour of the outcome you were looking for. (I&rsquo;ve seen it myself. I could not tell if it was deliberate at the time or not, but I suspect that there were particular interests at stake and consciously or otherwise, observations were skewed.)</p>

<p>I think the actual study and the conclusions from the study are reasonable. The study showed that dyslexic readers read Arial at 80 wpm with 1.7 errors and read Dyslexie at 79 wpm with 1.3 errors. Non-dyslexic readers read both fonts at 93 wpm with 0.7 errors with Arial and 1.0 errors with Dyslexie. Neither the speed difference nor error difference (nor interaction effect with non-dyslexic readers) was statistically reliable.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the study on the other hand has been quite unreasonable. I can’t imagine why a non-reliable 0.4 words per minute reduction in errors is being touted so strongly why a non-reliable 1 word per minute reduction in reading speed isn’t.~</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I have a serious question. What is the appropriate comparison if a future developer of a typeface for dyslexic readers wants to demonstrate the typeface’s effectiveness? Arial seems like a reasonable choice since, I believe, it is recommended by some dyslexic organizations. Although I am certain that Verdana would soundly beat Arial in most any reading performance test. I would propose Verdana as a comparison, though that is somewhat arbitrary based only on my knowledge that Verdana performs well on performance tests - other not-specifically-dyslexic typefaces may perform better than Verdana. Alternatively, such a typeface could be compared against the handful of other typefaces that were designed specifically for dyslexic readers? Thoughts?</div>

<p>I am certain of the opposite (once apparent size is factored in).
Verdana is very wide, unduly wasting retinal acuity.</p>
<p>The question of what font to compare to cannot be answered until
we can properly measure reading performance. We cannot properly
measure reading performance without a small army of people who
don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re being tested. Very hard. What we can do without
needing an army is figure out what letterform features help reading.
But test subject oblivion is still highly critical. Also critical is to have
tests designed by people unafraid of anecdotalism (using the non-
dismissive definition of that term).</p>

<p>Source?</p>
<p>“<em>Alternatively, such a typeface could be compared against the handful of other typefaces that were designed specifically for dyslexic readers? Thoughts?”</p>
<p>I would hazard that if we ran a few more fonts in the same study, any fonts, not just ones designed for readers with dyslexia, we would find that there is simply a natural variability in performance that can’t be attributed to the specifics of any one typeface.</p>
<p>Another observation regarding participant’s performance and subjective response, I could not determine from reading the paper if they were informed as to the nature of the study. In reading Appendix IV, I see participant responses stating “The experimental font…” and “The special font for dyslexics…”. If, prior to testing, they were informed that they were going to be reading a special font designed for readers with dyslexia it could easily contaminate their data. Certainly, in looking at it from a subjective point of view (Figure 7) they would “like” it more simply knowing that someone was trying to do something nice for them.</p>

The letters b and d are very distinct; the letters p and q are also distinct, but I admit I would have preferred a larger distinction.</p>

<p>Thus, for your consideration, two ATF typefaces: Tudor Black, and Washington Text.</p>
<p>For a matching uppercase that is more legible, Kingthings Petrock, for example, could be used. Or Final Roman, an obscure free font I ran into that looks very much like a Carolingian hand.</p>

<p>I do remember an earlier post by you in which you said that Fraktur was more legible than Roman. I tend to disagree with this. However, I will admit that some typefaces related to the blackletter or classed as forms of blackletter <strong>are</strong> at least as legible as Roman. For example, Jenson&rsquo;s rotunda from his edition of the <em>Summa Theologicum</em>.</p>
<p>And so, if future generations of children see Spot run in a good rotunda in order to accommodate dyslexics, I shall not regard it as a tragedy. Of course, the letterforms need to be compatible with Roman, in order that they won&rsquo;t be hindered in reading (older) books in Roman type, at least during the transitional period - if the (Latin-alphabet) world did change over to rotundas gradually in general because this is what the new generation is used to.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello Everybody,</p>
<p>Sorry for my poor English. When I started the project dyslexie one of mine goals was that no matter how the font looked like as long as he worked. With the idea if a wheelchair is ugly, he may not be made ore used? I know that the font is restless irregularity for those without dyslexia, and he many rules of type design are violated. But I wanted function over esthetics. Viewed from a graphic design it&rsquo;s an ugly font. But if you even know how many people with dyslexia I have helped here in the Netherlands and Belgium, and gratitude I get from people who struggle daily with dyslexia it&rsquo;s definitely worth it.</p>
<p>The price you mention is for schools and not for individuals. I have sold to individuals for a time for a much lower price (below cost) but the businesses and schools took so much abuse that I have here in conjunction with Lexima stopped until we have found a solution for it.</p>
<p>As a graphic designer I find this a very interesting discussion I keep track.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t have time to comment at length yet, but to begin to answer Kevin&rsquo;s question, I think that first of all if we are to distinguish what typefaces are better for dyslexics with some assurance, the testing must not be of two typefaces against one another, and only one test. The key here is to look for understanding of the cause of confusion of letters. And this will involve multiple tests involving a number of variables and variations.</p>
<p>For example, if the issue is differentiation, then any old style, such as Times New Roman, is more highly differentiated than a sans like Arial. For example, the b has its serif on the opposite side from the bowl, and the d the same side. The top of the b is weighted more heavily, and the bottom of the d. The bottom corner of the two letters formed differently, etc.</p>
<p>Also, if I have heard correctly, &ldquo;dyslexia&rdquo; is an umbrella term that refers to a variety of difficulties in reading, not all of which are the same. So again there needs to be more understanding and precision about what is being tested. For example, if I understood a brief account rightly, there is dyslexia among readers of Chinese, but it is less common, and apparently doesn&rsquo;t involve the difficulty in associating sounds and words that is a common difficulty for readers of alphabetic languages.</p>

<p>You are assuming that &ldquo;esthetics&rdquo; has no readability function for the majority of readers.
Your assumption both marginalizes and stigmatizes dyslexics unnecessarily, and derogates the function of a polished finish for fluent readers.</p>
<p>There is an elegance to an instrument that requires skill to master, which is what typefaces are.</p>
<p><em>But I wanted function over esthetics.</em></p>
<p>Why not have both? Your job is half-finished.</p>

<p>The motivation for the manipulations seems to be loosely related to the Anne Sperling work on the etiology of dyslexia in deficits in perceptual noise exclusion, associated with the formation of suboptimal perceptual templates or representations in both the auditory (phonological processing) and visual domains.</p>
<p>The Spirling work is innovative, the theory attractive, and the involvement of Mark Seidenberg gives it some weight, but I&rsquo;m not sure how the Sperling theory and the manipulations Renske makes address the error types Renske lists in Table 1:1.</p>
<p>Investigation of how the perceptual noise exclusion / suboptimal templates theory accounts for error types might be a prerequisite for intelligently deciding what comparator fonts to use.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If Anne Sperling and colleagues are correct, the auditory problem (“getting to the sounds of speech” — Sally Shaywitz in the NYT article) is only part of the deficit in developmental dyslexia. Perceptual noise exclusion in the visual domain and non-optimal visual perceptual templates probably are paired with the phonological awareness problem.</p>
<p>A long time MIT researcher on dyslexia, Gad Geiger has demonstrated that dyslexics recognized letters visually farther in the periphery and more diffusely near the center than typical readers did. Compared with typical readers dyslexics experienced greater crowding [noise?] in the typical Form Resolving Field, a rough equivalent to Denis Pelli’s uncrowded span. The reference is “Wide and diffuse perceptual modes characterize dyslexics in vision and audition” Perception, 2008, volume 37, pages 1745 – 1764, Gadi Geiger, Carmen Cattaneoô, Raffaella Galliô, Uberto Pozzoliô, Maria Luisa Lorussoô, Andrea Facoettiô½, Massimo Molteniô:
<a href="http://www.perceptionweb.com/perception/fulltext/p37/p6036.pdf">http://www.perceptionweb.com/perception/fulltext/p37/p6036.pdf</a></p>
<p>Remediation of the visual perceptual component comes by “a regimen of practice comprised of small-scale hand / eye coordination tasks and reading with a window mask” to narrow, and sharpen tuning in, the Form Resolving Field.</p>
<p>The question elicited by Renske de Leeuw’s manipulations is are they enough to address the dyslexic person’s deficits within the foveal field.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>An alternative approach to addressing the issue, at least for the specific form of dyslexia related to reversed characters, would be to change the alphabet rather than use a specific typeface. This could be done by borrowing characters with similar phonetic values from other alphabets.</p>
<p>Here is an example, including a special bonus feature to commemorate the participant in these forums who inspired this strategy:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alp-4_4488.gif]</p>
<p>There are four lines in the illustration. To start with, the problem characters are all replaced with corresponding characters from the Armenian alphabet, in which all the issues noted are resolved. This is done in the first and second lines, as there are two possible choices in Armenian for the replacement for the letter &ldquo;p&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But Armenian is quite unfamilar to most Latin-alphabet users. Thus, in the third line, I reduce the amount of adjustment required by replacing b, d, and p with their Cyrillic equivalents instead. That still leaves two letters to come from Armenian.</p>
<p>Finally, in the fourth line, I take the replacement for the letter q from Hebrew instead, so that only one letter needs to be replaced from Armenian. Which seems to integrate better with the Latin alphabet than, say, the Devanagari script.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps a bit more seriously:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is true, because if this kind of dyslexia remains equally common - or is equally likely to cause problems (after all, normal small children learning the alphabet will draw any letter backwards, not merely those with reflected counterparts) - then increasing differentiation is not really a useful tactic.</p>
<p>In any case, starting from GFS Artemisia as a basis, here&rsquo;s a genuinely more serious version of the lowercase alphabet, more likely to be recognizable:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, if it <em>is</em> possible to help everyone, not just a particular minority, so much the better!</p>
<p>However, I also do feel that any attempt at a script reform is likely to get nowhere. People are content, and see no reason to change. Of course, imperceptibly over time, some features of typefaces might change.</p>
<p>For example, Bodoni has quotation marks that are different from those of more traditional typefaces, and which are arguably more logical: the opening quote is a mirror-reflection of the closing quote and apostrophe. Had the designers of Helvetica and Optima and Stone, for example, all copied this, with the innovation then percolating over even into new serif typefaces like, say, Williams Caslon, perhaps in a few hundred years the new style of quotation mark might displace the old one.</p>
<p>The same sort of process might lead to the &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;g&rdquo; changing to an infanta form, if fashions pulled in that direction.</p>
<p>Even those changes are unlikely, though, and that seems to represent the limit of the kind of change that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It took a while to hunt up some information about this, but I found one forum discussion in which there was a link, still functioning, to the shorter version of a discussion of these matters, and later I found a [[http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/maslucida.gif|link]] to an image of your Mas Lucida typeface.</p>
<p>Earlier in my searches, I came to your MicroFoundry site, but I could not see a page there about this, or with that image on it. Perhaps I have a problem navigating the site; it seems to be a very small site with only a little content, and yet what I see suggests that there could or should be a lot there, but I&rsquo;m just not navigating it properly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I do remember reading somewhere that there is no such thing as a dyslexic in China, because the Chinese characters are not designed with geometrical shapes that are used in upside-down and reversed forms.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am sure that stigmatizing does not come into this. Instead, no doubt, the makers of this typeface, who are safeguarding their intellectual property, are hoping that <strong>all school textbooks from now on</strong> will be printed in this new typeface. <em>Think of the children!</em></p>
<p>Of course there may be existing typefaces with some of the properties of this one that would also be more readable by dyslexics. But they&rsquo;re probably display faces - whereas for this purpose one wishes to use an &ldquo;infanta&rdquo; design as the starting point.</p>
<p>For example, I doubt that schools would be willing to specify that textbook publishers use [[http://www.comicbookfonts.com/fonts/catalog.html?item=fonts:cl329|Fairy Tale]] from Comicraft to typeset their textbooks, even if it also meets the technical requirements.</p>
