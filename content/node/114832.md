  body: I feel that the bowl of the P should be larger, to match with the low crossbars
    of other capitals and the roundness of the lowercase.

  body: "I agree. /R looks correct, but the bowl of /P should be larger. The bowls
    of /P and /R don't necessarily need to match, and in my opinion they should never
    be the exact same bowl because in case of /P you need to compensate for the large
    space underneath the bowl.\r\n\r\nI also think the vertical serifs (E, F, L, T,
    Z, z) are too big and robust. It's not bad, but then I would make the other serifs
    and terminals more robust as well. You probably need a bit more consistency in
    your design."
