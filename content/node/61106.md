  regarding two letters in it. I'd like to ask you to have a fresh look at it and
  let me know if my thinking is right :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/phc_liga_before_6319.jpg]\r\n\r\nBecause
  of tight kerning the serif of the 'i' is very close to the 'r' and I'm not fond
  of the look of it. So I connected the glyphs (in small sizes the gap disappears
  anyway), trying not to destroy the shapes of the font (Malaga):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/phc_liga_after_4184.jpg]\r\n\r\nDo
  you think it works? Can you think of a better solution maybe?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAleksander"

    just typesetting -- working the specific letter combination until it's right.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    notice James left a little swing in the top of i in his sketch."

    the distance between the \"u\" and \"s\" seems more comfortable now. I'm not sure
    if I would have shortened the \"s\" like you did or rather sheared it at a different
    angle to click better with the \"u\". Because now I'm not sure the \"s\" isn't
    falling to the left ever so slightly? \r\n\r\nAnd Hrant, good point about the
    gap between the words!"

  body: "Don't worry altaira! I just test it to see how it works out, and only if
    I agree with a suggestion :) I made more versions of the \u201Cs\u201D and the
    above seemed to look OK. Skewing the glyph so that the spacing was good enough
    looked as if the \u201Cs\u201D was becoming regular in between italic letters.
    I'll show other options too and hope for more comments :)\r\n\r\nHrant, as for
    the \u201Ct\u201D I don't know - I think it is consistent with other letters.
    Or did you refer to something else? I like this warm and brush-stroke-like character
    of the typeface and while I agree to correct kerning and other optical problems
    I would prefer to leave the letters untouched. The designer of the typeface clearly
    spent his time making sure all the characters belong to the same family.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the \u201Cp\u201D I could agree but shouldn't \u201Ch\u201D be shortened accordingly?
    If so, shouldn't the dot of the \u201Ci\u201D be lowered too?\r\n\r\nThe name
    PrintHouse is written as one word in all company's communication, as opposed to
    other print houses out there.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n"

    a font, not a logo! Big difference. Some people even believe that leaving a font
    alone when making a logo is a sin of sorts.\r\n3) You already modified the \"i\".
    And SKEWING?! :-)  Plus you seem be open to modifying the vertical proportions,
    which affects a \"font\" (which like I said this no longer is anyway) massively.\r\n\r\nNow,
    if you prefer it like that, leave it alone, sure.\r\n\r\n> As for the \u201Cp\u201D

    If so, shouldn\u2019t the dot of the \u201Ci\u201D be lowered too?\r\n\r\nWell,
    I'm looking at how this thing is using the space, as well as letter confusability
    issues. Unless you remove the tittle (which I wouldn't advise) the ascender space
    is being used anyway and the \"h\" should take advantage, especially since its
    ascender keeps it from looking like an \"n\"; in contrast the \"p\" is sort of
    wasting the space below, and a short descender doesn't make it look like any other
    letter. BTW, even looking at this as a font I'd say the descender space is too
    much (because of letter frequencies in real text). In my book making the descenders
    exactly the same length as the ascenders (which looks like might be the case here)
    is a Modernist simpletonism.\r\n\r\n> The name PrintHouse is written as one word\r\n\r\nAh,
    but look at the useful capitalization (which you're not using). If they like it
    all-lc they might still be missing the fact that decipherability might suffer
    -if only slightly- when it's output in one color with no shading. But I'm really
    only talking about the absolute thinnest of wordspaces.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
