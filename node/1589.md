  body: There&#39;s at least one example of a type designer naming his daughter after
    a typeface, but I can&#39;t remember who it was. Matthew Carter mentioned it at
    ATypI 1994 in San Francisco, and joked that we might soon be celebrating the birth
    of Helvetica Brody. This was much funnier in 1994.

  body: Ed Benguiat told a student that the way you can identify Franklin Gothic is
    to look at the lowercase c. It looks like a keyhole turned sideways, and since
    Ben Franklin used a key in his electrical experiments it has to be Franklin Gothic.

  body: I think there was a discussion here a while back about what  <BR>typeface
    was used for the Microsoft logo.  <BR> <BR>Obviously, they use ITC Franklin Gothic
    extensively in the  <BR>corporate identity, but if you look closely at the logo,
    you  <BR>will see that it is not Franklin Gothic &#40;ITC or otherwise&#41;. All  <BR>the
    obvious Franklin Gothic details &#40;including Benguiat&#39;s  <BR>&#34;keyhole&#34;&#41;
    are absent. In fact, it looks as much like  <BR>Helvetica as Franklin Gothic,
    but not exactly like either.  <BR> <BR>It seems likely that it started out as
    one of those two, but  <BR>was redrawn and modified.
