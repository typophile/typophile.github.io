  or scanner? I've been digging through cnet and its really hard to separate the wheat
  from the chaff (often the user reviews don't jive with those of the editors...stupid
  users or glad handed editors?).\r\n\r\nI'm fine with buying each of these separately
  but is there a multifunction that does all three or two of the three well? Cardstock?
  Duplexing? \r\n\r\nBTW the wiki on this is lacking, so maybe we could get a start
  with this thread.\r\n\r\n"

    design work. They\u2019re made to save space, not do quality work."

  body: "Thanks James,\r\n\r\nI'm a digital photographer so I'd like to have something
    to print high quality photos.\r\n\r\nBut my most pressing needs require a good
    scanner (for digitizing source material for design work) and a printer for printing
    proofs of work I'm doing on books and possibly one that I could use to print chapbook
    covers (we can't always afford letterpress) and body. Though I'm not sure we'd
    be saving money with that strategy. \r\n\r\nI'd also like a printer that I don't
    have to plug in to my computer so it can sit in another part of the room (I work
    from home and space is limited). \r\n\r\nI'm willing to spend around $500 for
    each item. Or would you recommend spending more on the printer and less on the
    scanner? \r\n"

  body: "Well, when it comes to scanning you really need to think about the final
    output: are your pieces printed well enough that better scans will result in better
    prints? And are you scanning really great color photos to begin with? I prefer
    Epson scanners\u2014the drivers and scanning software are the best around, the
    output is always great, they\u2019re fast, and you can buy them refurbished at
    Epson.com to save a lot. Whatever you do, don\u2019t go near HP scanners, the
    output, drivers, and software are all terrible.\r\n\r\nRight now I\u2019m really
    sick of printers. I\u2019ve been using Epson inkjets for about five years now
    and I can\u2019t recommend the new models unless your output is mostly glossy
    photo printouts. Epson\u2019s newer Stylus printers (at least the sub $1000 models
    I\u2019ve used) don\u2019t work worth a damn. The sheet feeders are terrible,
    and on uncoated stocks streaking is common, even with Epson\u2019s expensive inks
    and papers. Given the premium prices an Epson is only worth buying if you have
    an unpaid intern to keep it working. I\u2019ve heard really great things about
    the new Canon printers, and Canon ink is cheap, so give them a look. You can find
    the best printer reviews on digital photo sites."

  body: "Thanks again James. \r\n\r\nI'm mostly scanning things that I will be manipulating
    and often vectorizing. I'll definitely take a look at the Epsons (didn't know
    you could get them refurbished! good tip) and the Canon printers.\r\n\r\n"
