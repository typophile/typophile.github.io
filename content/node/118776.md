  body: "Image technical requirements:\r\nThe best way to post an image is to use
    the \"Insert Image\" function below the \"Comments\" box. To utilize this function,
    you must have the Flash 8 player installed. If you have an image to accompany
    your post, please ensure that it conforms to the following guidelines: do not
    exceed 600 px wide, save images as an RGB jpg/gif/png (tips: gifs are usually
    crisper for black and white type renderings and not all browsers support png).
    Also, make sure that your image has a unique name, otherwise typophile may call
    another image instead of the one you intended to be displayed.\r\n\r\nPlease be
    sure post it in the Critiques forum, and in the correct sub-forum shown on the
    Forums main page."

    Netscape and other browsers based on them. Oh, and text-only browsers such as
    Lynx and Elinks.\r\n\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics]]\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers]]"
