  on conference fees*. \r\n\r\nBoth organizations are very pleased to offer this new
  benefit their members. \r\n\r\nMembers will receive an email telling them how to
  take advantage of this offer soon. \r\n\r\nIf you are not a member of ATypI or SoTA
  you may want to join or re-join now to take advantage of this new benefit. \r\n\r\nATypI
  and SoTA hope that this discount will further promote relationships, dialog and
  education about type and typography. \r\n\r\n*Note: The 15% discount applies to
  conference registration, but not to individual classes, hotels or airfare etc."

    would be happy to discuss a reciprocal arrangement with the TDC. I don't think
    it's lame to have <em>begun</em> by seeking an agreement with an organisation
    whose event is most similar in terms of structure, frequency, etc..\r\n\r\nThe
    TDC organises many more events than either ATypI or SOTA, and also has a regular
    publishing programme, so I can imagine that finding a mutually fair reciprocity
    might involve more careful examination that would have been necessary for ATypI
    and SOTA, who basically have the same sort of thing to offer each other's members."

  body: "John is correct. Figuring out what might make sense with the TDC is genuinely
    complicated. And making these things happen takes a long time. I am not complaining
    here - just explaining the reality of the pace at which things can move. \r\n\r\nMaking
    an arrangement with SoTA was a kind of low hanging fruit to reach for in the sense
    that both boards seemed interested in finding a way to do it, and as John points
    out the purposes of the ORGs and even the events are similar. So I went for the
    easiest thing first. Also, I am new to this stuff and still learning about it
    so simple was better to start with.\r\n\r\nI am quite keen to find agreements
    with all kinds of org groups and business (including the TDC) provided the arrangement
    is mutually beneficial and satisfying to both groups. I am not the arbiter of
    this question, and I won't and can't be. I am in a sense just doing a bit of matchmaking.
    \r\n\r\nI do think more of these arrangements can and should be created and with
    luck I will be able to announce more in the future. \r\n\r\nIn fact if anyone
    has a suggestion of a benefit they would like to have (or offer) vis a vis ATypI
    \ free to let me know privately or here on this thread as you prefer. This isn't
    just for organizations but also applies to schools and business'.\r\n\r\nSimilarly
    if you would like to see an arrangement made or can help me to generate one -
    be in touch!\r\n\r\nAnd finally, if I have my facts straight, the TDC doesn't
    send its show for free. Sending the show to ATypI is a service ATypI pays TDC
    to do. As a result, the sending of the show doesn't make sense as a reason for
    ATypI to offer TDC members benefits. They are separate issues."

  body: "Just to clarify, ATypI and TDC both have major costs in putting on the TDC
    display at ATypI. ATypI pays for the mounting of the show, and for the space for
    the show, and gives free admission to two people to the whole ATypI conference.
    TDC pays for shipping the stuff to the conference location, and travel costs for
    the two people who put it all together. The ATypI part typically amounts to $4000+
    in direct expenses, plus about $2000 worth of free conference admission (~ $500
    of that being hard costs). I expect the TDC's costs are similar, though I haven't
    asked.\r\n\r\nI think all parties benefit from it as well. The ATypI conference
    attendees get to see a fabulous showing of typography and type design. The TDC
    is promoted to the ATypI conference attendees, and these sorts of showings of
    the honorees help justify the submission fees for the contests (which in turn
    presumably fund the TDC's costs in doing the showing).\r\n\r\nSo, nobody is getting
    something for nothing, and everybody benefits.\r\n\r\nI don't think I am speaking
    too far out of turn to say that even prior to this thread, we began talking with
    the good folks at the TDC. We're still wrestling with the rather different kinds
    of events involved, so it is TBD whether we will come up with a mutually agreeable
    solution.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nThomas\r\n(ATypI treasurer)"
