  body: I know it&#39;s not exact, but I think <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stempel-schneidler/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=48&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=HOMESTEAD"
    target="_blank">Schneidler</a> was the model for this. The serifs have been redrawn,
    but I think the underlying letterforms are very similar. The E was my main reason.
    <BR> <BR>OK, now it&#39;s time for Mark to come in and tell us what it really
    is. ;-&#41;

  body: This one kind of stumped me. I thought it might be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/weiss/bold/testdrive.html?s=HOMESTEAD&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Weiss</a>, but that didn&#39;t look right. There&#39;s another
    face called Schniedler Titling &#40;also Bauer Titling&#41; which is closer to
    the look, but not as bold. <BR> <BR>The numbers, incidentally, are Goudy Extra
    Bold. I&#39;ve seen that &#34;THE&#34; thing somewhere before, too.

  body: The reason I picked Schneidler has to do with the proportions of the arms
    on the E. The top two arms are very close in length and the bottom is quite a
    bit longer. I also noticed the shape of the D, with the underside curve near the
    stem. Also the serifs on the T move the same directions as those in Schneidler,
    but appear to have been cut off at the tops. The stroke thickness can easily be
    doctored in Illustrator, as we know. <BR> <BR>The E in Monkton doesn&#39;t have
    the same proportions. All three we have mentioned have the same M &#40;along with
    Trajan and Giovanni, as two more I can name&#41;, but I think the resemblance
    ends there, except with Schneidler. <BR> <BR>I guess if we are allowing that this
    font has been modified, debating which is closest is a bit academic, but that&#39;s
    my vote.

  body: Don&#39;t get me wrong, Mike--I agree with your assessment.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    kind of a strange one, something familiar about it. Almost like it started out
    somewhere else and has been redrawn through several iterations. Sort of like telephone
    tag with letterforms.

  body: Definitely modified. The E&#39;s don&#39;t match. I also looked at Weiss &amp;
    Trajan but nothing quite syncs up. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been trying to post on this
    thread for hours. Go figure.
