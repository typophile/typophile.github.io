  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Rotis, the village is about 15 miles away from where I live and was born. I never got to know Otl Aicher. He died before I heard of his work. The typeface Rotis was later always part of my typografic life, because I discussed it a lot. To be honest for a long time I hated it. But what I hated much more was the theory Otl Aicher built arround it. 
I am still getting angry now, when I see so many designers and architects following him without much critique.
Still there is something about it that interestes me.
A few years ago I started to draw a new interpretation of the Rotis idea, because there was a potential client that wanted a headline face in this direction. It never happened, but I went on with it. 
I started it from zero, never used any outline of the Rotis fonts. 
The first thing you can see is, that it is not condensed. That never really worked in Rotis.</p>
<p>At the end there are not many elements left that remind on Rotis, accept the often discussed e and c. The stroke is oldstyle while the rest of the forms are neoclassically upright. I kept it in my first version.
Because it follow two different concepts in the stroke I made two alternate versions. One with an angled axis, called the oldstyle stroke version and one with an upright axis called the neoclassical stroke version.</p>
<p>I want to ask you a two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you think it has got enought character to live a life next to Rotis?</li>
<li>Would you do extra fonts, or Open Type styles for the alternate versions?</li>
</ol>
<p>I have never based my fonts as near to an existing design as in this case. So I am quite eager to hear what you think.</p>
<p>Hubert</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t have much insight into your 2 questions, but I will admit that I love the work you&rsquo;ve done so far.</p>
<p>It feels like a more robust Rotis. The ampersand is back to normal; even sophisticated looking. I especially enjoy the @, registered and copyright symbols.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if your tracking is quite right yet, especially the spacing between words, which feels too wide.</p>
<p>the lowercase a is very elegant. The lowercase f however doesn&rsquo;t seem dense enough, and I&rsquo;d like to see the lowercase t with an angled top like in Rotis.</p>
<p>The uppercase Q and R are nice, but they don&rsquo;t share the same unique feel of Rotis&rsquo;s Q and R.</p>
<p>The one thing that sets your characters apart from Rotis, is that some of your strokes end outward, were Rotis&rsquo;s would end downward. Such as in a, c, y, 2, 3, 6, and 9. I don&rsquo;t know if this a true argument as much as it is an observation.</p>
<p>Very nice work Hubert.</p>

<p>Yes. There are still very few modern sans families with contrast. There is room for more.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">

</ol>

<p>I would definitely do OT for those who are using Adobe CS. But [[Mark Simonson]] has a nice solution for those customers who might not be using OT-savvy apps: bundle both options: a full featured OT with the alts, and separated OT fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The next thing I started with Legau is a bit more extreme, but it also deals with angles of the stroke.
In one of my serifs I flipped the angle of the stroke to the right in most of the round characters.
<a href="http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/serif/Leaf/">http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/serif/Leaf/</a>
the same concept I now brought into Legau.
I will also upload another pdf to show you text as well</p>

<p>I am not sure of the more recent editions though.</p>
<p>I worked with Otl Aicher for nearly two years, on the development, marketing and commercial release of Rotis type family. This was back in 1987-89 when I was a manager at Afga Typographic (previously Compugraphic, now Monotype Imaging).</p>
<p>I spent time in his studio at Rotis in Leutkirch im Allgäu.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks to both of you for your comments. after reading &ldquo;Is Rotis a typeface?&rdquo; i can definitely see echoes of the same problem within the field of architecture - people espouse a theory, but what they produce using that theory is not what they say it is.</p>
<p>that said, i agree that Rotis is great for titles, headlines, and logos, but have never felt ok about using it to set large blocks of text. taken individually, i think that the letterforms are quite beautiful.</p>
