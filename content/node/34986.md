body: "I am starting a research project\u2014hopefully to become my thesis\u2014regarding
  the design of grotesque typefaces. My goal is to identify the commonalities in grotesque
  type as well as the individual quirks, flaws, and standout features, then use the
  knowledge gained to develop a neo-grotesque of my own. I think that ten faces will
  be enough, and right now I am still a little unsure about which ones to choose.
  Following are fonts I am looking at, I would appreciate your feedback.\r\n\r\nThe
  Current Contenders:\r\n1. Akzidenz-Grotesk: A great starting point, as it is the
  first grotesque to make the jump from jobbing to serious work. Also important as
  it was the starting point for the design of Helvetica.\r\n2. Franklin Gothic: This
  appears to be the first significant American sans and has remained popular since
  it was introduced.\r\n3. Trade Gothic: I am unsure about including Trade Gothic.
  While it appears to have enjoyed decades of popularity, the more I look at it, and
  into its history, the less reason I see to include it.\r\n4. DIN/FF DIN: Important
  because of the historical signficance of the DIN organization in design and because
  I think that the narrower, more vertical design than its predecessors which has
  influenced the design of the neo-grotesques.\r\n5. Monotype Grotesk: Again, this
  one seems much less significant as I move along\u2014its only real significance
  seems to be that Arial is pretty clearly rooted deeply to the design of Grotesk
  215 as well as Helvetica.\r\n6. Univers: I\u2019m pretty sure this one requires
  no explanation.\r\n7. Helvetica: Honestly, there\u2019s so much to pick at here
  that I would love to be able to leave it out for the sake of balance.\r\n8. Neue
  Helvetica: I think that this one should at least be combined with Hevetica, if not
  dropped entirely. While the design does an excellent job fixing the flaws in the
  design of Helvetica and making it consistent across weights, from what I can tell,
  the high cost of complete sets has made it somewhat unpopular. \r\n9. Arial: Do
  I include this one for the sake of its popularity, or just dismiss it as a fluke?\r\n10.
  Meta: Historically Meta seems especially important as the first really popular neo-grotesque.
  Because Meta is so well designed, an examination of the features Prof. Spiekermann
  incorporated reveals a lot about its predecessors. \r\n\r\nI am also considering
  adding Verdana to the list, this seems justified as Verdana seems to be the most
  significant well-designed grotesques meant for onscreen use. It certainly seems
  like a better choice than Arial.\r\n\r\n"

    metrically compatible variants (some of which, eg. Monotype Albany do interesting
    things on Arial/Helv metrics) as a subsection of the Helvetica story. \r\n\r\nDefinitely
    include Verdana ;-) esp. if you're coming to TypeCon as we'll have some never-before-seen
    behind the scenes material on the font. Just got back from a trip to Vancouver

  body: "I don't consider Meta or Verdana to be grotesques, neo- or otherwise. I prefer
    a new category for Meta, \"Narrow Information Sans\", which derives from Orator,
    Trade Gothic, and other categories of type. Verdana? Not sure how you're associating
    that with the grotesque category. \r\n\r\nI would be interested in further research
    into earlier (earliest) grotesque designs and their precursors. Helvetica is really
    quite removed from them in its antiseptic regularity. Showing that evolution I
    think is interesting. \r\n\r\nYou might like to peruse <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/helvetica-and-alternatives-to-helvetica/\">Stephen's

    that Akzidenz-Grotesk had come to stand for a whole bunch of 19c typefaces. Instead
    of repeating that, might you go back and see what else was there? I'd be fascinated
    to learn what (if anything of value) has been lost in the taking of that part
    for the whole that has become the conventional history."

    <em>think</em> that Neo-grotesques are designs that add humanist quirks to the
    old grotesque designs. IIRC the term appeared in <em>Revival of the Fittest</em>
    and may appear in <em>The Complete Typographer</em>. It\u2019s a pretty rarely
    used term, so the whole notion is murky.\r\n\r\n<cite>I would be interested in
    further research into earlier (earliest) grotesque designs and their precursors.</cite>\r\n\r\nAs
    would I, but that would require traveling to Europe to peruse old specimen books
    and other printed works, along with learning in German. It would be an excellent
    graduate thesis (or better yet, a PhD.), but it\u2019s not doable with the time
    and budget I have for undergrad work.\r\n\r\nAs for what fits under the mantle
    of a grotesque, I guess that it just depends on how loosely one defines the term.
    I should probably come up with some solid definitions for the categories I want
    to look at and figure out if they fit under my umbrella of grotesque or if I need
    to adjust my targets."

    applied to a handful of typefaces that the original H. Berthold AG bought up between
    1890 and 1920. In 1957 and 1958 G.G. Lange redrew the whole line to fix a lot
    of the inconsistencies\u2014although he left a few\u2014and expanded the range.
    There are some really great threads that explore the history of AG. But it\u2019s
    been over a century with two devastating wars and some serious economic and social
    upheavals since those old grotesks were folded into the AG name, so tracking down
    information is a pretty serious undertaking."

  body: "This seems to lack focus at the moment.\r\n\r\nHistorically, there are a
    lot of variations of the grotesque, more than enough for learned library research;
    and there are huge lacunae surrounding the origins of the genre, and the origins
    of its lower case and italics. I suspect that one would have to dig deeper than
    specimen books to find the answers.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the scale, today
    there are many foundries doing \"their\" grot -- OurType and Process spring to
    mind -- and IMO these are more interesting extensions of the genre than widening
    it to include Meta etc. In fact, Meta has spawned its own genre.\r\n\r\nThe Helvetica-ish
    category is presenterd in the recent FontShop promotion, and Stephen Coles amassed
    quite a few fonts for that.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by \"significant\"? certain
    forms of historical research could quantify that, eg the gross weight of foundry
    type sold, or the number of newspaper readers. In general I am extremely sceptical
    of that term, as it is used by authors to justify there own preferences, preconceptions,
    and prejudices. I've designed a couple of grots, with another on the way, all
    of which I consider extremely significant! -- and for quite different reasons."

    as I would love to do all that research, I fear that it will not be possible with
    the resources available to me, particularly time. You make a good point about
    contemporary grotesques, and researching those would probably turn up a lot of
    useful information about their roots that could later lead to deeper research.\r\n\r\n<cite>What
    do you mean by \u201Csignificant\u201D?</cite>\r\n\r\nSo far I have been thinking
    of significance in several ways, certainly too losely. I see that I need to reconsider
    what makes the typefaces significant, in terms of technical/aesthetic developments,
    history, and influence on descendents and derivatives. Ditching Meta, and even
    Helvetica, and focusing more on the types that stay closer to the late Nineteenth
    and early Twentieth century grotesques seems like a much better idea."

  body: "Gill is sort of the grandaddy of humanist sans type, so it\u2019s out. Metro
    and Futura are geometric sans, and even farther from what I want to get into than
    Helvetica/Univers. Gotham falls into some weird vernacular hybrid category (Along
    with Neutraface and other similar designs) that I\u2019m not about to try categorizing.
    \r\n\r\nAfter thinking about this stuff some more, I see two options\r\n1. Cut
    things off, stylistically, just before Helvetica/Univers. This way I get to focus
    more on grotesques with a more human quality than those with none. I also don\u2019t
    have to worry about the grotesque/neo-grotesque categorization arguments. Design-wise,
    this sends me down the path of a traditional grotesque.\r\n\r\n2. Ditch my earlier
    notion of neo-grotesque and treat Univers and Helvetica as the origin of the neo-grotesque
    (which after a little reviewing last night I think is correct) and follow those
    developments up with the newer categories that come with the innovations of Meta,
    Verdana, etc.. This one is a little more appealing as it gives me reason to explore
    the definitions of new categories, and to create a contemporary design of my own."

    from an very old show on PBS about antique furniture. The guy would put one chair
    or something on a pedestal, and go on rhapsodizing about it for a half hour--or
    maybe it was an hour. It was great. One of the things he always said was that
    if you want to understand an object, look at the period just before it. Every
    craftsman is reacting to what came just before, what he has grown up with. It''s
    true, and that''s the key. So I think concentrating on the original grotesques,
    and then going forward to look at modifications is a great idea.    '
