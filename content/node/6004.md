  body: A formal analysis of the character shapes makes me believe  <BR>the logo is
    custom designed, or at least customized. The &#34;fr&#34;  <BR>ligature is very
    uncommon &#40;only one typeface I know of has it&#41;,  <BR>the left side of the
    &#34;u&#34; fits snugly against the &#34;r&#34;, the top left  <BR>serif of the
    peculiar &#34;v&#34; follows perfectly the movement of the  <BR>tail of the &#34;f&#34;
    into the foot serifs of the &#34;r&#34;, while its swash fills  <BR>the gap between
    the &#34;r&#34; and the &#34;u&#34; perfectly, and both &#34;e&#34;s  <BR>are
    designed in such a way that they &#34;perform&#34; flawlessly.
