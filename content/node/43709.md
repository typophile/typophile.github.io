  directly. (Yes, I use Corel. Their academic licensing allowed me to purchase their
  X3 suite for $95. Find me a similar deal for Adobe and I'll change my allegiance.)
  Now, I'll be the first to admit I know nothing about PS fonts, but would it be worth
  my while to fiddle around with this?

    it as a font editor. \r\nI would rather suggest Font Forge or TypeTool. "

  body: 'While I agree with Ralf, I believe there was even an option to export fontfiles
    (.ttf) directly from CorelDraw. I have done it once, many years ago. I''m not
    sure how it worked again, but you''d place a character on a page of certain size
    (which would work as sidebearings) and export/save it constantly to the same file
    untill the charmap was full. '

  body: Yeah, the ttf option doesn't seem to be there in Corel X3, which is what I
    have. But the pfb option is still there.
