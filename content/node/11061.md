  body: 'My source was even less exotic, perhaps -- Jaspert, Berry &amp; Johnson&#39;s
    &#34;Encyclopaedia of Type Faces&#34;. <BR> <BR>I suspected that the answer might
    be Clarendon, based on the clues you gave. Since Clarendon is a subcategory of
    Egyptian &#40;slab serif&#41; faces, it seemed to fit. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I saw in Jaspert, et al, that Clarendon was released in
    England in 1845. I also remembered from various sources that Clarendon was designed
    specifically for dictionary work. <BR> <BR>===== <BR> <BR>Alrighty then.... This
    may be an easy one. <BR> <BR>This prolific font designer spent his working life
    designing for the Ludlow Typograph Company of Chicago. <BR> <BR>While it wasn&#39;t
    a conspicuous commercial success, arguably his most interesting design was a &#34;serifless
    roman,&#34; a sans-serif font with proportions and contrast like a roman serif
    font, which pre-dated Hermann Zapf&#39;s Optima by some thirty years. <BR> <BR>Name

  body: You&#39;re close. Radiant is indeed a vertically-stressed sans serif, but
    it lacks the proportions of classical roman letters, and it was relatively successful
    commercially. <BR> <BR>The font I&#39;m looking for is much closer to Optima in
    structure, which came three decades later.

    <BR> <BR>A bloody good point, John. Letter frequency seems to be their principle
    criterion. Whether or not these &#39;suitable&#39; fonts have a full Welsh character

    <BR> <BR>This doesn&#39;t surprise me. A colleague did some work for the Welsh
    Language Board a few years ago, and while they were insistent that fonts needed
    the W/w and Y/y with circumflex they seemed to be totally ignorant of the fact
    that the dieresis can also be applied to these vowels. Very strange considering
    their mandate. Admitedly, the dieresis is much less frequent than the other diacritic
    marks, but you would think the national body responsible for the promotion of
    the language would be aware of it. I provided my colleague with detailed information
    regarding diacritic frequencies from one of the editors of <i>Geiriadur Prifysgol
    Cymru</i>, the most complete and scholarly Welsh dictionary.
