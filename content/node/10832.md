body: 'The real deal TypeCon2003 website has launched, complete with a list of over
  60 speakers, workshops schedules and details, secure online registration, and more.
  Speaker bios and photos, program topics and schedule and other good things to come
  as soon as we get all the info. <BR> <BR>The site was designed by Typophile T-shirt
  design contest winner and all-around fabulous guy, Mark Simonson.  <BR> <BR>The
  site&#39;s at <a href="http://www.typecon2003.com" target="_blank">http://www.typecon2003.com</a>.
  There are some fun photos from last year&#39;s conference in Toronto... an early
  bird discount is in effect through April 30, and SOTA members get additional discounts
  on top of that. <BR> <BR>Fair warning to procrastinators: the workshops fill up
  &#42;very&#42; quickly! <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t forget, this year&#39;s speaker list
  includes our beloved Jared and Joe, plus little Stephen Coles! Plus Matthew Carter,
  Jill Bell, Peter Bilak, Jim Parkinson, Kent Lew, Dave Farey, Sibylle Hagmann, and
  many more fine folks. <BR>'
