  \ Besides the space you could drive a truck through between the W and A, it's really
  nice.  Anyone know what it is?  I though it might be <a href=\"http://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/index.php?id_categorie=1&id_font=9\">Didot
  Elder</a> but the third serif on the W is different from the sample on the <a href=\"http://www.optimo.ch/home.php\">Optimo's</a>
  website. \r\n\r\nSorry if this is a \"you didn't know it was _______, what a loser\"
  but I can't figure it out.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tim_walker_3779.gif]"
