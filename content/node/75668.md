  body: It's not Bembo, but does have the same swash on R and general resemblance.
    thx! It looks stretched, but the left facing serif is unique. It is a legitimate
    font, sharp and crisp. I think it may be an historical font.

    are similarities (even though your example seems to have suffered digital distortion).\r\nThe
    |A| is clearly off, though.\r\n\r\nedit: Maybe a customised font / logo lettering
    that mimics an older typeface?"
