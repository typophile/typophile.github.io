  the combinations are endless, but I still want them to be usable. \r\n\r\nSo I was
  reading a very old topic about the 'ffj' ligature. And thought: That is completely
  useless. \r\n\r\nOr is it? \r\n\r\nNow I am really doubting to put in the 'ffj'
  ffb' 'ffk' 'ffh' in. They look nice, but:\r\n\r\n - in what language are they actually
  used?\r\n - in what fonts are these ligatures included? (and why) "

  body: "In some fonts, pandering to discriminating typographers, I include the \"extra\"
    ligatures ff, ffi, ffl, fj, and ffj. However, I don't include ligatures for fb,
    ffb, fh, ffh, fk and ffk, because these lack typographic cachet. \r\n\r\nNonetheless,
    I do consider the possible collision of \"f\" with a following ascender, and design
    it, and the ascender, with that in mind.\r\nOften, some positive kerning is required
    -- but that's not too heinous, because it occurs between syllables (as can be
    seen from the instances cited above).\r\n\r\nIn other fonts, rather than ligatures,
    I have made an alternate, overlapping form of \"f\" specifically to precede ascenders,
    this activated by a contextual OpenType substitution."

    significantly reduces the number of characters in your font, and even allows for
    (depending on weight/design etc) a moderate degree of tracking.  Not hard to add

  body: "Matthew and Khaled, I surely have interest on this elegant solution. I can
    image how to code these ligatures throught contextual alternates: you create alternative
    glyphs and do substitutions.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot understand how it was made in
    Tasman to achieve the effect shown in its specimen PDF (the specimen says its
    ligatures are made from contextual alternates):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tasman_5148.gif]\r\n\r\n.\r\nThe
    first f does not seem to be the same glyph for \u201340 and +15 tracking as there
    is no enough room in second f stem to \"hide\" the arm. How to do this?\r\n\r\nAbout
    <strong>uni1E1F</strong>, it seems it must be smaller in Irish typography to let
    dot accent align vertically with dots above b, d, s and r. So, it's not suitable
    for ligatures."

  body: "It appears to be the same to me.  But that you probably couldn't track much
    more in either direction.  What if you manually insert those characters and track
    farther than InDesign will normally let you?  (or use a program like Pages, which
    won't break them even at high tracking).\r\n\r\nYou can have contextual replacements
    ignore or pay attention to diacritics, so perhaps run the initial replacement,
    then do another one that is diacritic specific (if you're adjusting heights).
    \ But I would think any text that wants the lenition dot to be at the same height
    would have a t and f designed at x height (that's a radical sizing difference,
    I'd think, to do contextually based on the accent)."

    you're right, it's the same glyph.\r\n\r\nHow to set kerning for these ligatures?
    I suppose it demands specific kerning for each ligature.\r\n\r\nAbout uni1E1F,
    it becomes strange if we adopt Irish typographic rules in Latin script. Maybe
    I will create alternates t and f with dotaccent and let user adopt it if he/she
    wants.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help."

    have single substitution table (not attached to any feature) that substitutes
    each component by its alternate glyph\r\n* a calt lookup would then use the context

  body: "There seems to be a very interesting difference between the English and the
    German language regarding the use of ligatures.\r\n\r\nThe German language is
    (in)famous for allowing the merging of any number of nouns (and other grammatical
    units) into compounds of theoretically infinite length like <em>Rindfleischetikettierungs\xFCberwachungsaufgaben\xFCbertragungsgesetz</em>
    (beef labeling supervision duties delegation law). Hence many combinations of
    consonants are conceivable.\r\n\r\nThe English language, too, knows compounds
    (like the above mentioned cliffhanger), but they're neither arbitrarily combinable
    nor (usually?) made of more than two words.\r\n\r\nNow, while in English, you
    would seemingly use the ffh ligature for the word cliffhanger, in German, you
    would not. Were cliffhanger a German word, we'd use the ff ligature for cliff,
    but we wouldn't ligate the cliff and the hanger. We'd use the st ligature in <em>Muster</em>
    (sample), but not in <em>Mustopf</em> (which could be written as <em>Mus-Topf</em>;
    a <em>Topf</em> for <em>Mus</em> = a jar for pulp or puree). It's not a <em>Mu-Stopf</em>
    or a <em>Must-Opf</em>, but a <em>Mus-Topf</em>. Not a clif fhanger or a cliffhan
    ger, but a cliff hanger. The omission of the ligature is supposed to mark the
    word joint.\r\n\r\nAnother example: the fl in <em>Kaufl\xE4che</em> (<em>Kau-Fl\xE4che</em>
    = chewing surface) can be ligated, the fl in <em>Kaufleute</em> (<em>Kauf-Leute</em>
    = merchants) can't.\r\n\r\nThe practise to ligate only within morphemes and not
    over grammatical joints is clearly of linguistic, not of aesthetic nature. Not
    ligating the ff and k in <em>Suffkopp</em> (bingehead) may make the compound of
    <em>Suff</em> and <em>Kopp</em> more easily recognizable as such (for what it's
    worth), but the resolution of the aesthetic problem of the f and k meeting by
    using a ligature is made impossible. I'm undecided about whether this rule is
    a good one or not, it's both beneficial and disadvantageous. I think it depends
    on whether you see the benefit of ligatures in making text more readable, more
    pleasurable to look at or more linguistically concise (although, of course, these
    aspects are intertwined).\r\n\r\nAn exeption from the rule are suffixes beginning
    with an i: we'd use the ffi ligature in <em>fluffig</em> (<em>fluff-ig</em>, fluff-y),
    whereas suffixes beginning with an l (like in <em>stofflich</em>, <em>stoff-lich</em>
    = materi-al) do not depart from the rule (i.e. no ffl ligature in <em>stofflich</em>).
    Don't ask me why; it doesn't seem to make sense to me. Nota bene: the ffl within
    a morpheme would be fully ligated.\r\n\r\nThis is also the reason why we don't
    need triple ligatures like fff or ppp or sss, although words (only compounds)
    with three following identical consonants exist (after the 1996 spelling reform).
    An example is <em>Schifffahrt</em> (<em>Schiff-Fahrt</em>, meaning shipping or
    boat cruise; formerly spelled with only two f, but hyphenated to <em>Schiff-fahrt</em>
    at linebreaks): the <em>Schiff</em> and the <em>Fahrt</em> aren't ligated, hence
    ff-f.\r\n\r\nThese rules are not absolutely binding; at least I don't know of
    any official reglement. They're what's considered good typesetting practise.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I have a very hard time thinking of a German word that contains ffj <em>and is
    not</em> a compound of two morphemes.\r\n\r\nThere are no such rules in the English
    language, right? Do similar rules exist in other languages?\r\n\r\nJens"
