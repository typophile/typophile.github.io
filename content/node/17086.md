    is not as useful as having a proven example of what one is attempting. So for
    you here, that would ideally be eight separate screen-shots of the first two pages
    of FontLab's Font Info. \r\n\r\nFor your problem James, I haven't done what you're
    attempting, so my only advice (if you haven't already done this) is to make sure
    that you're not using any font management tools. I just drag successive new versions
    of fonts into my \"user>Nick>library>fonts>\" folder, after I have trashed the
    previous version, and don't have any font management software installed (except
    FontBook)."

    Maybe the port to Mac is not as clean as the original Windows version? Maybe next
    years rev will be better.\r\nHow do your fonts work in InD Mac? If they have the
    same problem there, you are probably seeing something you need to fix on your
    font.  If they work great in InD Mac, it might be an issue with Word.\r\n\r\nStay
    far away from Suitcase though. It never seems to really erase a previous version

  body: The OpenType names work fine on both platforms. It is the "Short Names" that
    i am trying to harmonize. It seems that MS Word/Windows uses the Menu Name and
    MSWord/Mac uses the Full Name or some permutaion of it. SInce the client requires
    similar naming on both Mac and Windows in Word, my search continues.

  body: "James, have you given any of these fonts a Mac Name (second panel in FL 4.6)?
    This is the name used in non-OT aware apps in like MS Word/Mac. The name must
    not be longer than 29 characters or it will not appear in MS Word/Mac font menus.
    Normally, all members of OT families appear in MS Word/Mac (assuming their Mac
    Names are not too long). MS Word/Win only shows the roman (plain) member of each
    family. It sounds like some of your OT font Mac Names are too long for MS Word/Mac,
    so they are not all showing up. \r\n\r\n(I am not sure what happens if you leave
    the Mac Name blank. I think the system will get it by combining the Family Name
    and Style Name (OT names panel) but I am not sure. I don't ever leave it blank.)"

  body: The little diamond thing just combines the other two fields. In doing so,
    it can make a name that is too long, so you need to check it afterwards and edit
    the name to make it shorter if necessary. I plan this stuff out ahead of time
    in an Excel worksheet, coming up with a naming scheme where none go over the 29
    character limit.

  body: James, what do other font families look like in the Mac Word menu? Is the
    use of the full name rather than family name consistent? Or are there fonts that
    behave as you are hoping yours will? I'm wondering whether this is a font naming
    issue or an application issue, and I don't have a Mac on which to test this myself.

  body: John, It appears that the use of full name rather than the family name is
    the consistent behavior and most likely  an application issue. My client may have
    to live with the inconsistency.

  body: "And it appears that there is really no cross-platform compatibility between
    MS Word Mac/Windows, at least I cant get it going. The fact that the Windows side
    looks at Family Name, and the Mac side looks at Full Name. Very disappointing!
    \r\n\r\nI suppose you could create font Family names that are really Full Names
    ie. MyFontName-Book etc. Make everything regular with no style linking, but it
    seems like a long way to go to get two sides of the same application to talk to
    itself."

- author:
    name: '.00'
  body: Not at all. It is rather a simple solution, but I have always misunderstood
    the Mac Names field in the OpenType Names panel in FontLab. Mark Simonson's comments
    made me realize that that particular field had no relationship to OT (I always
    thought it did). Since MS Word reads The "short" Family name along with the style,
    I just made sure that Mac Names field was filled in with the exact same info.
    That coupled with Adam's naming tips and everything works fine. More of a relief
    than a breakthrough. Thanks for the insight Mark.

  body: "That makes sense. This field in the OpenType Names panel relates to name
    table ID 18:\r\n\r\n<code>Compatible Full (Macintosh only); On the Macintosh,
    the menu name is constructed using the FOND resource. This usually matches the
    Full Name. If you want the name of the font to appear differently than the Full
    Name, you can insert the Compatible Full Name in ID 18.</code>\r\n\r\nIt is OpenType
    related insofar as it was added in the OT specification, and was not previously
    part of the TT spec."
