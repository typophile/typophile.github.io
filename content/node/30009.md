  body: "MissG, I think you're confused about what you're asking for here.\r\n\r\nYou'd
    do better to illustrate it yourself. Years ago an art director commissioned me
    to do a book cover that looked like the neon lights on the strip in Las Vegas.
    The following image was part of the result.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bulb-sml_4188.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
    is simply Photoshop technique that can be applied to the vector information in
    any font. I think you can find tutorials about how to do this online. It helps
    if you're starting with a font that's in keeping with the style, which is why
    that link to House Industries above that Lari posted is useful, but there's no
    one font (to my knowledge) that conveys the glow of neon lighting."

      to them two up above: They got their heads up their bums. They think they can
      say nasty things to me. Maybe they're both very insecure in life and can't get
      enough of picking on and bullying some one. See me other threads for proof.
      You'll find out what exactly is going on. They don't give no snowballs for me.
      It's ok, it doesn't bother me anyway.  They just can't seem to act there age.
      Shame on them. I actually feel sorry for them now. "

    few questions for you. \r\n\r\nWhy are you continually asking such inane questions?
    Is there a purpose to this? You don't seem to respond to the answers only to the
    complaints so I'm curious as to your intent.\r\n\r\nWho exactly are you? Why not
    identify yourself? From what you have provided you are female(?), dyslexic, fought
    off a life threatening illness at the age of 17, and seem paranoid. But you feign
    to know little about the subject concerns of the list, either that or you are
    someone who is falsely portraying naivety and just screwing with the good intentions
    of serious folk who actually make an attempt to respond to queries.\r\n\r\nWhat's

      Morris one I posted before? Please don't even go there. I have had enough already
      from everyone so just don't do it okay? \r\nIn regards to 'What's Up'? Well,
      nothing is up. Everyone is just making a big deal about me not spelling right
      and not good enough grammer. I have agreed to make more of an effort but what
      really upsets me is that if people give me respect, i give respect back. That
      is what is up. If people treat me and my threads with respect, then I shall
      give back more if I can and if I have the knowledge to do so. Everyone on here
      thinks it's ok to mess around on my threads and treat me like nothing. Atleast
      I don't do that on someone elses thread, do i? I have done nothing to upset
      no one (apart from spellings and grammer and i didn't know it would affect so
      many people) but I have accepted that now. I am trying my best. What else does
      everyone want from me on here? Please don't turn this thread into a World War
      3 thread. The world doesn't need it. The case rests here and NOW!\r\nPS Bieler,
      what is so 'inane' about this question? What have i done now eh?"
