  with types. I'm designing a website which I originally chose Helvetica for my headings
  and Bodoni MT for my text. However, I noticed that Bodoni did not quite displayed
  as I expected. I still like Helvetica for my heading, and just tried Deja Vu for
  my text and scratching my head over this one. Can any one suggest a good pairing
  with my Helvetica?\r\nI would really appreciate that!\r\n\r\nCheers,"

  body: There are lots of great educational resources on FontShop.com, including a
    PDF on complements and alternatives for Helvetica. You can go to http://www.fontshop.com/education/
    and download the "Helvetica" PDF on that page and skim through it for suggestions.

  body: "Thank you for pointing me in the right direction. I think that the complexity
    here is the find a font that you can can use for the web. Readability is key especially
    for body text if one decide not to go with the usual suspect (georgia, verdana,
    etc..)\r\n\r\nDeja Vu is crisp, even at 1.1 em, but I'm open to other suggestions.\r\n\r\nCheers,"

  body: I noticed <em>one</em> thing I didn't like about Deja Vu, on looking at your
    example. It seems almost to be letterspaced. Thus, although it isn't monospaced,
    it makes me think of a typewriter face.
