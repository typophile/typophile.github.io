body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo_4738.PNG]\r\n\r\nI love the plank
  type structure of this quirky font. Its the capitals of main text I'm mostly interested
  in but small case below would be a bonus. I hear you are the experts- I'm not despite
  my hours of searching through random font sites. Can anyone help ;-))"
