  is a font used on Alfa Romeo dials. It's similar to Eurostile.\r\nIt could be custom,

  would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Sorry, I hadn't read your comment under the samples. Right, this is not Eurostile
    but this is really too close to be a coincidence. Actually, most of digits and
    letterings for the car industry are custom. So may be it would be not so hazardous
    to conclude it's custom and, to me, based on Eurostile Extended Black mainly reworking
    counters connections.

    see the differences comparing /6 counter of Alfa Romeo 4C (your second sample)
    and Audi RS5 one. Audi RS5's is rounder than Alfa's. But you're kind of right
    because as you perfectly said form the beginning, they're all very close to Eurostile
    Extended without definitely being it. I'm also pretty convinced you'll get no
    \"better\" answer than \"custom/proprietary typeface(s)\" (in the same vein as
    Eurostile Extended/Microgramma to me).\r\nMore credit for the \"Eurostile Extended\"
    track: [[http://4c.alfaromeo.com|Alfa Romeo 4c]] website is using it everywhere..."
