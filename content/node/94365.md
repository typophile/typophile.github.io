  was [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik|Graphik]]  for a little while,
  but the a's are quite different. \r\n\r\nIt's also very close to [[http://vllg.com/klim/calibre|Calibre]],
  but with a different 'K' and 'M'.\r\n\r\nSee cover here:\r\n\r\nhttp://media.magpile.com/covers/seattle-met/xgzmDl6lFvSKD4gD.jpg\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nhttp://media.magpile.com/covers/seattle-met/WkvELO2mJjWNb2Tp.jpg\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nPeter"

  body: "Hey Peter,\r\n\r\nLooks like you got your answer. I switched our primary
    sans from Gotham Narrow to Chrono for the April issue. And we haven't looked back.
    It's worked well for a range of uses, from small copy to huge headlines. Personally,
    I'm a big fan of [[http://processtypefoundry.com|Process Type Foundry]] and we
    use their Anchor and Capucine as well. If you're considering the typeface, you
    can see interior samples on our  [[http://flickr.com/seattlemetdesign|Flickr page]].\r\n\r\nAM"
