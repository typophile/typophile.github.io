  feature should not use GPOS but instead use GSUB, with fonts including additional
  glyphs to support the feature.\r\n\r\nCan anyone confirm if this is true and if
  so point to a source reference?\r\n\r\nthanks."

  body: The published <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm#case">feature
    description</a> suggests that this could be done with either GSUB or GPOS. I don't
    recommend doing it with GPOS, though, because that will create issues where glyphs
    are kerned; these issues could be resolved with further, contextual GPOS adjustments,
    but that's a lot of tricky work, whereas GSUB makes everything much simpler.

  body: "Thanks John, I hadn't considered the kerning implications, in that respect
    GSUB is the more logical choice.\r\n\r\n@eli  This feature is not unique to VOLT
    built fonts and there are many fonts out there that have used GPOS for this feature.
    In FontLab GPOS <case> can be created easily in a single line of feature code,
    but as John pointed out, this may well throw up some additional issues."

    I'm having trouble thinking of any."

  body: Perhaps I'm wrong John but I didn't Adobe first try this feature with GPOS
    then switch to GSUB? There is probably a few of these still around.
