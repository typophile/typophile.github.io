  body: "According to Goudy. the unique versions of the traditional square letters,
    known as \"Vilna\" or \"Siddur\", were cut by Bodoni's students in Italy, based
    upon ancient drawings.\r\n\r\nYet, the great type designer and well-versed scholor,
    Scott-Martin Kosofsky, claims that these are fictitious tales fabricated by Goudy,
    who was known for his tall tales.\r\n\r\nI think here Kesofsky may be wrong, and
    owe Goudy's memory an apology.\r\n\r\nThe letter forms belonging to Menachem Mann
    Romm appear to be influenced by Bodoni's unique style. Furthermore, his square
    letter designs are different than all other Vilna renditions. These two facts
    seem to substantiate Goudy's version, whether he was privy to these historical
    details, or determined them by analyzing the popular Tslmudic letter designs."
