  the Saved By The Bell logo.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/images_3470.jpeg]

  body: "I doubt if any fonts were used to make that logo, and at least two styles
    were used: sans and serif. The fact that the two L's in BELL are so different
    supports the idea that these were drawn by hand. Maybe [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/boink/|Letraset
    Boink]] could be used for BELL, with some tweaking. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/el-vistereo/|El
    Vistereo]] might be a starting point for SAVED, and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/blhd/soylent-blu-bh/|Soylent
    Blu]] for BY THe. You could probably find freebie fonts that would also have some
    of the same feel as these three lettering styles.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
