body: "I'm handing in my thesis (in electrochemistry/biochemistry stuff) in about
  a month. Now, my university demands the text to be set at 12/18 and margins to be
  2,5cm, except for the left-hand margin - 3cm, but that's about it. I know, no one
  who will look at the thesis cares about what typeface I might use, but that's not
  the point.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm working with a seriously limited budget, so as much
  as I'd love to license something beautiful (and finally stop yearning for Renard),
  I hardly think a kidney in exchange is a healthy alternative, so I'm waiting until
  I run into a bit of money and go insane. Temporarily. Besides, I do need a whole
  lot of greek characters and superscript digits from 0 to 9, among other more peculiar
  glyps, which made me think of Gentium. I didn't have such a great opinion about
  it, but that changed after seeing it printed specimen - it looks a lot better than
  on screen. Originally I was looking for something more modern, but considering that
  it's free and has all the goodies that I need for the technical stuff, it seems
  like a good compromise. \r\n\r\nThat's it for body text (unless you think of something
  better), so now there's the titles to thing about. I was thinking about pairing
  the serif with a sans. I don't know which ones would go well with Gentium (or how
  you may check if 2 typefaces go well together, for that matter). Since I'm skimping
  on the serif, I see this as an opportunity to spend some money on a couple of weight
  of a nice sans to kick off the library. Thoughts? Thanks!"

    A professional font for free and a number of sans-serifs free from the same designer?
