body: Hi, I&#39;m new to the board and joined up because I can&#39;t identify the
  font used on the logo below. Does it look familiar to anyone? I thought maybe it
  was a Comic Craft Monster font, but after checking their site and several, I gave
  up. <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>-Nixed<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/62701.jpg"

    gazillion handwritten  <BR>scripts like that one out there, and the only chance
    you have  <BR>for getting it identified is that somebody who knows it stumbles  <BR>onto
    this thread and recognizes it.

  body: Actually, this one looked familiar to me somehow, and I looked for a while
    on this one at all the handwritten and brush sites I know, and came up empty.  So
    at least one guy gave some effort to help you search. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  Hopefully someone can come in here and nail it for you
    though.
