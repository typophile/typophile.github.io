    you nail one yourself. Good one!\r\n\r\nIt definitely looks like Cluff. Does anybody
    have a sample of a more complete character set to evaluate?"

    I know how fast ya'll are, so the whole time I was looking for it (I *knew* I
    had it...) and posting it, I was like, \"please let me ID it, please let me ID
    it, please let me ID it...\" Ya'll have been so great ID'ing these fonts for me,
    and I didn't want to be all like take, take, take. :) But I am no where neeeeeeeeeeeear
    as good as ya'll are at ID'ing these things, so this will probably be my only
    one! :)\r\n\r\nI don't know where a better image of the font is online, so I'll
    upload one myself if you like...\r\n\r\n"

    i'm a type nerd, but i bought some Halmark stuff a year or so ago just for the
    fonts. I don't know about the EULA, but they are floating fonts, you can use them
    in other apps."

    set of the Hallmark scripts in the Script Font ID Guide. (If those of us with
    older Macs still had a way to post images I could have showed you the full sample,
    but you can see the one that is currently in the <a href=\"\">Guide in Part 9,
    page 7</a>).  I will probably be replacing some of the smaller samples Mike F.
    sent with new larger ones from Paul that I just received.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: back to tiff's question about copyright... i picked up a copy of the Hallmark
    card software at Target last night and noticed the copyright on the packaging
    read something like this "For personal use only. Not to be used for commercial
    purposes." I'm pretty sure that covers the font software as well as the card software.
    I don't think you have to limit use of these fonts, however, within the card program,
    but you should be able to use the fonts in any other programs (as long as you're
    not making money off their usage). At least that's how i interpreted it.
