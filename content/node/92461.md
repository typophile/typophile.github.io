  joke on her on April Fools day.\r\nI want to modify this picture of an ultrasound
  of twins with her name on it but I cannot identify the font.\r\n\r\nMy PC uses Windows
  7 so if the font discovered is not \"Normal\" then a link to where I could download
  it would be very appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for trying.\r\nPorkchop"

    aren\u2019t fonts you will find to use on your computer.\r\nThat said, if you
    use the Edit link to move the thread up to the Type ID Board, someone could chime
    in with suggestions of similar fonts."

  body: 'i don''t know what copy you want to put on it or change, but there is likely
    almost a full alphabet there. If it gets opened in photoshop, you should be able
    to assemble the message from the characters already found. '

  body: What Tromley said. Just copy/paste/rearrange characters in Photoshop and the
    type will match exactly. Be sure to save a backup copy of the original image in
    case you decide to start over and it's too late to undo or revert.
