		<div class="commentbody">Personally, I quite like the less swoop-y version with the shine to it. It was in line with their hardware, and still simple enough to accommodate the different colors (for cases and product lines). <BR> <BR>I think apple strove and continues to strive for 1) sleek, different, elegant hardware 2) friendly, simple print design. Their interface design is trying to reflect both of these and, unfortunately, sometimes forgets its place in the process. However, I think that ITC Garamond Tall 'n' Fat and Myriad match(ed) Apple's desires. I'm sure that they aren't the most typo-rigorous choices, but they have other concerns. At least they didn't use Gill Sans, which is <em>everywhere</em> in the US for corporations whose creative directors don't want to actually make a decision concerning their identity/ branding.  <BR> <BR>Believe me, Apple is in the upper echelons compared to some of the obscene 'style guides' I've seen. One major medical company actually stipulates &quot;san serif&quot; for headlines and &quot;serif&quot; for body copy! <BR> <BR>PS: The packaging for the old iPod was brilliant, and is a great example of what keeps a lot of people loyal. It even had Myriad on it. And <em>somehow</em> it still worked.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">To me, there is no PC/Mac debate. It's just tools, and since the software is basically the same, it's all just a matter of taste anyway. Both operating systems have massive faults, and I for one woul dbe happy to see something sleek and completely new come along that feels like InDesign felt compared to Quark.  <BR> <BR>The porice, however, is not an argument. The kind of hardware you need for a really good system makes Mac and PC almost equally expensive. My machine is in the 17.500 Euro range, and a really nicely tuned-up G5 would be in the same range. It really boild down to what you're used top and what you feel more comfortable with. I still stand by the Umberto Eco comment that Mac is catholic and PC is protestant :-).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer the mac, but it cannot compete when it comes to computer gaming. <BR> <BR>Anyway, they're 2 different tools. They match and mismatch in many ways. What I want to know is why do people seem so eager to devote their mind and spirit to a corporation or corporations they know very little about? Believe me, if your opinion of a company is based on its website and its products, you have a <i>very</i> incomplete picture. <BR> <BR>To swerve back to the topic (sort of): What's so wrong about a given company using a chrome look to their mark, particularly Apple, if it also works in B/W, etc.? Is there something <i>inherently</i> wrong about it? Again, I think that Apple has a pretty distinct look (as a whole) and some very strong brand management. They <i>are</i> a consumer-oriented, image-conscious electronics manufacturer/ software developer. Why would they keep their image (which I consider to be a subset of their brand) static? <BR> <BR>Look at Nike. Their logo gets used in all sorts of materials and colors, but the Swoosh is still the Swoosh. I think the same goes for the Apple. The surface changes, but the mark endures. I understand the disdain for shiny, swooshy crap, but most of those low-grade redesigns often accompany a total brand overhaul and a total re-shaping of their mark. Apple has remained very controlled compared to many corporations. I think that's probably why we freak out every time they tweak (redress) the logo or change the typeface (What is it, <i>once</i> so far?. <BR> <BR>It's hard to be innovative and consistent at the same time. Most of the objections I've read are high-minded design concerns that ignore the practicalities of business and focus on a conceptual level, or are a general reaction to sheep-like actions of large corporations (which is hardly shocking). Consumers still know Apple, still recognize the mark, and Apple still looks contemporary. What other visual brand concerns should they, as a corporation, have?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Graham, thanks for the corrections on both counts. <BR> <BR>___ <BR>Re: Apple's new chrome logo <BR>I had a good laugh at Christopher's comment. &quot;What can  <BR>chrome do for you?&quot; As if Apple needs a swoosh to be a  <BR>modern company. But why are you all acting surprised?  <BR>This isn't news, it's their status quo. <BR> <BR>The fact that Apple is going with a chrome logo is nothing  <BR>new. It is true to what they've always done on both their  <BR>hardware and software sides. <BR> <BR>Hardware: Beige boxes had the rainbow. The blue and white  <BR>boxes got a transparent blue plastic apple. The recent  <BR>PowerBooks have solid white ones. <BR> <BR>Software: Mac OS 7 had a rainbow &quot;Apple Menu&quot; logo. Mac  <BR>OS X has a blue plastic looking logo. The new one  <BR>apparently will look like chrome instead of plastic. <BR> <BR>___ <BR>Re: The logo changes in general. Does Burton still change  <BR>theirs annually? That's something IBM and FedEx can't do.  <BR>Kudos to them for knowing how to break the rules.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; XP is ugly and bloated.  <BR>You can simply change that by hacking a bit and changing some stuff. And, sadly, the blue-pill-Apple look isn't so sleek either. Here's hoping both companies give more power to the user in future. At least with XP you can completely and utterly alter the surface and look/feel of the OS with tools like WindowBlinds. That should be a given with XP itself, but at least there is a tool for it :-D.  <BR> <BR>&gt;Commodores (64s - but also SuperPets) <BR>Oh, that's cool. I noticed today at a meeting how many designers refer to their career by mentioning old hard- and software. Which version of Pagemaker, or which Mac/PC you started with, or even if you started pre-Computer, it obviously kinda sticks in your mind.  <BR> <BR>quiksilver looks oddly un-Carson in a way of looking too much like Carson, if that makes sense &ndash; more like a student imitating David. It has the superficial look, but doesn't feel like his Ray Gun stuff, it's just visual, not really</div>
