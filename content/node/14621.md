  know if there is any common knowledge of the most common repeating sets of two characters

    that it was completely rejected rather than built in as an option. After all,
    it is something that requires user input, be that installing a font, or ticking
    a box for alternates. I hope to see this in the future, as I feel it opens up
    a world of possibilities.\r\n\r\nI assumed this on-the-fly chaos was how those
    dutch chaps ran their Beowolf font -- now I guess they applied code to an existing
    font in production, and just output several versions. Or perhaps they built a
    little bespoke engine? At the end of the day those who build typesetting software
    are unwittingly restricting creativity, so good on them if this was the case.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for that hrant. I found a solitary pdf on said subject, but it doesnt look like
    something my brain, currently operating on basic motor skills, is capable of digesting
    without some serious homework. Cheers again.\r\n"
