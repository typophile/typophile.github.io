<div class=commentbody>MissG, I think you're confused about what you're asking for here.
You'd do better to illustrate it yourself. Years ago an art director commissioned me to do a book cover that looked like the neon lights on the strip in Las Vegas. The following image was part of the result.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bulb-sml_4188.jpg]
This is simply Photoshop technique that can be applied to the vector information in any font. I think you can find tutorials about how to do this online. It helps if you're starting with a font that's in keeping with the style, which is why that link to House Industries above that Lari posted is useful, but there's no one font (to my knowledge) that conveys the glow of neon lighting.</div>

<div class=commentbody>MissG. Please <em>don't </em> ignore what Patty and Linda have to tell you; it's not personal, it's just about spelling. Correct spelling is important – especially in a 'place' like this. It would be immature not to learn from one's mistakes I think.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's not my fault Ben. I am dyslexic and i'm trying my best.
In regards to them two up above: They got their heads up their bums. They think they can say nasty things to me. Maybe they're both very insecure in life and can't get enough of picking on and bullying some one. See me other threads for proof. You'll find out what exactly is going on. They don't give no snowballs for me. It's ok, it doesn't bother me anyway. They just can't seem to act there age. Shame on them. I actually feel sorry for them now. </div>

This has been going on for some time now and I have a few questions for you.
Why are you continually asking such inane questions? Is there a purpose to this? You don't seem to respond to the answers only to the complaints so I'm curious as to your intent.
Who exactly are you? Why not identify yourself? From what you have provided you are female(?), dyslexic, fought off a life threatening illness at the age of 17, and seem paranoid. But you feign to know little about the subject concerns of the list, either that or you are someone who is falsely portraying naivety and just screwing with the good intentions of serious folk who actually make an attempt to respond to queries.
What's up?</div>

<div class=commentbody>So is this thread going to turn into another of those like the William Morris one I posted before? Please don't even go there. I have had enough already from everyone so just don't do it okay?
In regards to 'What's Up'? Well, nothing is up. Everyone is just making a big deal about me not spelling right and not good enough grammer. I have agreed to make more of an effort but what really upsets me is that if people give me respect, i give respect back. That is what is up. If people treat me and my threads with respect, then I shall give back more if I can and if I have the knowledge to do so. Everyone on here thinks it's ok to mess around on my threads and treat me like nothing. Atleast I don't do that on someone elses thread, do i? I have done nothing to upset no one (apart from spellings and grammer and i didn't know it would affect so many people) but I have accepted that now. I am trying my best. What else does everyone want from me on here? Please don't turn this thread into a World War 3 thread. The world doesn't need it. The case rests here and NOW!
PS Bieler, what is so 'inane' about this question? What have i done now eh?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Miss G, it seems to be a rule that people are more brutal on the internet than they would be in person.
To avoid provoking them on spelling--and I am writing as a naturally bad speller also--type your posting first in Word or something else that has a spell checker. It will catch eg. that 'grammer' should be 'grammar'. The green grammar squiggle also helps catch typos. </div>
