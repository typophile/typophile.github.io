  body: "The first two suggest that your kerning is a mess. Are you expanding class-based
    kerning to flat kerning tables instead of using OpenType kerning? \r\n\r\nThe
    third probably means that you have the same glyph defined twice in a class or
    feature."

  body: "A glyph may be placed into a left AND a right kerning class OR a kerning
    class that applies to both sides of a pair. Place it into any more kerning classes
    than that and you will get errors.\r\n\r\nIt sure would be more helpful of FontLab
    to warn when you make the error rather than wait until you build the kern feature
    and try to compile, which may be long after you made the error. Short of that,
    the only solution is to be very careful when setting up your kerning classes."

  body: "Hi Dunwich. Yeah it was a mess but I think I've got it under control now.
    Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\nHi again Mr. Simonson!\r\n\r\nI'll repeat what I
    just wrote on our fontlab forum:\r\n\r\n\"Yep. You're right. The problem was in
    my classes. They were all messed up. This is my first font, and while I was working
    on it, I wound up really messing some things up. The only thing that finally fixed
    it for me was to go back to a previous version and copy and paste glyphs from
    the new one into that. From now on I will be more careful. Live and learn. Now
    I don't get any error messages, but I'm still copying and pasting and realigning
    glyphs right now.\"\r\n\r\nYeah it would be nice if fontlab would warn you ahead
    of time when you make errors in the classes panel. Especially if you're new to
    kerning and classes like me.\r\n\r\nThanks again Mr. Simonson. You've really helped
    me out in the past too and I appreciate it."
