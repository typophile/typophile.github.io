  body: "It looks like I posted my answer to one of the multiple versions of this
    post that disappeared. It is Sacker's Gothic from Agfa-Monotype's Engravers 2
    package, which comes in multiple weights and has the same '&'. Bitstream's Engraver's
    Gothic has only one weight and a different '&'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
