		<div class="commentbody">There are some things I really like &#40;such as the shy top of the &#34;a&#34;&#41;, but I have two big complaints: <BR>- The strong head serifs are pulling the design counter-clockwise &#40;which is not easy to counteract&#41;. <BR>- The widths are inconsistent, like look at the &#34;b&#34; versus the &#34;h&#34;. <BR> <BR>Some specific suggestions: <BR>- The &#34;f&#34; is too soft and big on top. <BR>- The &#34;g&#34; is too mannered: tame the ear, and make the head smaller. <BR>- The &#34;k&#34; is wonderful, although in the &#34;too narrow&#34; group. <BR>- Put a notch in the ear of the &#34;q&#34;. <BR>- Tame the beak of the &#34;r&#34;. <BR>- Make the &#34;t&#34; stronger. <BR>- I actually like the &#34;v&#34; et al. <BR>- Open up the &#34;x&#34;. <BR>- The &#34;z&#34; is too blocky. <BR> <BR>BTW, your vertical proportions are right on for use at small sizes &#40;like 9 pt&#41;, and the darkish color matches that too.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your Tips Hrant, they have been very useful. Sometimes somebody else has to open up your eyes. <BR> <BR>I hope I understood everything in the right way. <BR>I decided to change the head serifs for some smaller .  <BR>My problem still is the color of &#34;v et al.&#34; , as you said, they appear as if they didn&#39;t belong to the typeface. <BR> <BR>I was fighting hard with the g and decided fo a closed version, the other one &#40;you don&#39;t see&#41; with the opened tail was way too disturbing for text. <BR> <BR>Generally I have to thank all who post here at typophile, since I have learned a lot from this thread yet. <BR> <BR>I also found a nname for it now: &#34;apena&#34;.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Dominik, <BR> <BR>This looks nice! <BR>I don&#39;t think you went too far with the head serifs :-&#41; <BR> <BR>f: I think it wants the same kind of terminal as your y and r. &#40;Though I&#39;d choose beaks not ball terminals.&#41; Also, it curves too abruptly. Look at the c for more of the flavor. <BR> <BR>hmn: the h and n are too narrow. The m looks like 2 n&#39;s. keep the m, and widen the h and n. <BR> <BR>r: The arm joins to high &#40;same place as the n&#41;. Lower that down for better color. I&#39;d also make it narrower. &#40;and do a beak like the f&#41; <BR> <BR>s: I&#39;d take a touch of weight out of the curves and put it into the spine. <BR> <BR>vw: take in the serifs a bit. These letters cause spacing problems as it is. More serifs mean too much white space around the letter. <BR> <BR>x: looks like he&#39;s just kicked a soccer ball. ie, the bottom right should extend below the baseline &#40;too high now&#41;. Also, you are in the presence of an optical illusion: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21279.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>Sliding the thins left and right does two things: <BR>1. Fixes the optical illusion and makes them look like they&#39;re connected. <BR>2. Helps the shape fit into a trapazoid: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21280.gif" alt=""> <BR>You want the trapezoid shape so the letters don&#39;t feel like they are leaning, and are nicely balanced on the ground. Check your x,s,g,z <BR> <BR>y: A little wider up top &#40;left&#41; <BR> <BR>p: decide what you want. I&#39;d put a serif on the left side of the decender too. Keep the form for the q. <BR> <BR>Keep it up! <BR>Randy <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;m back again. <BR> <BR>I had a long fight with the uppercase. I couldn&#39;t really decide about the proportion of these. I didn&#39;t like them to have same width all over &#40;as far as this is possible&#41;. So I took a base rectangle and tried to construct them.  <BR> <BR>Further I changed the lc &#34;s&#34; again and made it a bit narrower. I didn&#39;t like the look of two wide &#34;ss&#34; standing next to each other. &#40;An &#34;ss&#34; ligature comes to my mind right now, because if the &#34;s&#34; stands alone at the beginning it looks a bit small now&#41; <BR> <BR>Next thing I&#39;ll get done is the spacing. I played arround a bit and had some good results. &#40;I used the summary in &#34;Type &amp; Typography&#34;&#41;. <BR>But after changing some character widths I quickly used FOG&#39;s autop spacing and lost it all again. <BR>The optical spacing feature in InDesign wasn&#39;t better though, the type seemed like &#34;gesperrt&#34; &#40;I don&#39;t know the english term right now&#41;. I had to correct it by at least &#34;-50&#34; to get a good result. <BR>So I hope I can provide a text setting soon. <BR> <BR>These were my problems so far.
