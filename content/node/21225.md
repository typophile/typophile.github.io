  body: "I can't find this fleuron in any of my books, including old metal type ornaments
    and borders. It was interesting looking at the designs, however.  Monotype has
    several that might be substitutes, epsecially one called Arabesque Borders and
    Ornaments.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be a single design, unlike many fleurons that
    are assembled from reflected images. Is it possible it is hand-, or computer-drawn,
    and not part of any font?\r\n\r\nHow old is the image?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
