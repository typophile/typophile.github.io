body: This is probably a very simple question for you experts out there but I'm wondering
  what the font is for the attached lettering that appeared on the windows of Sam
  Spade's office in the John Huston film The Maltese Falcon. Was this a stencil letterhead?
  I'm sure it was in widespread use in the 40s. Any chance that it's still available
  today somewhere? Thanks in advance for your help!
