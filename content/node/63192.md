  in Central Park?? I feel like it's similar to Garamond but it's more condensed and
  the serifs are a little different. Any suggestions?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_00451_5937.jpg]

    THIS LINK</a> you'll see there are quite a few different cuts of Garamond. ;)\r\n\r\nThe
    stone cutter may have also taken a few liberties in adjusting the letterforms
    and serifs a touch."
