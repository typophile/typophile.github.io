    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Well, the geometry of the typeface used for the
    Kalsa Panth  <BR>logo makes me believe it&#39;s either the outline version of
    a  <BR>system font that originally was bitmap based, or an amateur  <BR>design.
    Does anyone know a condensed sans serif system  <BR>font for Windows that looks
    like that?

  body: Usually when we run into a wall like this, it&#39;s because it&#39;s a custom
    design &#40;not likely in this case&#41;, it&#39;s an obscure freeware font that
    even Mike F doesn&#39;t know, or it&#39;s not a single font. That would explain
    why the K is so wide compared to the other letters. <BR> <BR>For example, I could
    use the H, A, L, S, P, T and R from Chalet Comprime &#40;incl. alternates&#41;,
    the K and N  from Neutraface or Futura &#40;with some N squeezing&#41; and I could
    re-create it. The Neutraface option keeps it all in one foundry, but Futura is
    widespread. <BR> <BR>I know you guys/gals could think of other fonts that would
    supply the necessary letters.  <BR> <BR>Sometimes the answer might be in thinking
    &#39;outside the font folder&#39;, so to speak. I know many of you are gagging
    right now. Sorry.
