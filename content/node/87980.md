body: "It seems to me that it should be feasible to create decent looking fonts with
  upem values between 64 and 128.\r\n\r\nThe purpose for me is to represent points
  as 8-bit values in memory restricted microcontrollers. In the past I have defended
  my viewpoint that the advantages of outline fonts make them preferable to bitmap
  fonts even on microcontrollers. The typical microcontroller today has lots of processing
  power but not necessarily a lot of RAM. Quarter VGA colour displays are easily connected
  to such a micro and I just hate to see nasty blocky fonts being used on hardware
  that in my opinion might just as well display beautiful anti-aliased sub-pixel positioned
  outline fonts. Once the rendering of outlines is in place the render code can be
  used for displaying more types of graphics, for instance buttons of various shapes
  and sizes.\r\n\r\nSome experiments that I have carried out seem to confirm the idea.
  I converted various 2048 and 1000 upem fonts to 128 upem fonts, with some of the
  fonts the conversion was hardly noticable whereas the more artsy fartsy fonts suffered
  a great deal from the conversion. On a QVGA display no bells and whistles are required.
  One of the arguments against outline fonts would be that they require too much storage
  space, but I just cannot believe that this is true. Especially if I can consequently
  store point data as 8-bit values. In addition to low space consumption, fixed 8-bit
  values would offer simplicity and efficiency.\r\n\r\nAre you aware of the presence
  of such fonts? Is anybody using such fonts? Designing them? Are there simple font
  file formats based on similar ideas?\r\n\r\nI am a software developer, not a designer.\r\n"

    the data in the fonts I am producing is scaled (e.g 60 UPM units per pixel), so
    the final UPM size is not as small as the design size.\r\n\r\nI would be interested
    in testing if fonts with a 1:1 grid ratio work well in common font engines. Please

  body: "I know that many of John Downer's typefaces have been drawn on a relatively
    course grid. I'm not sure if the fonts actually have a low UPEM setting or if
    he just snaps each point to some multiple of units, but you might ask him for
    more information.\r\n\r\nOn a related topic, Matthew Carter originally designed
    Charter to take up as little storage space as possible. (He tells a funny story
    about how, after finishing the design, he was told that the computational restrictions
    he had designed it for were no longer an issue.) Again, I'm not sure what the
    UPEM settings are for those fonts, but it might be relevant to your inquiry."

    UPEM because he calculated that even a single character at full screen size couldn\u2019t
    display much more information than that and so he could keep the font file size
    considerably smaller as a result.\r\n\r\nNot as small a UPEM as you\u2019re talking
    about, but the same general concept."

  body: I don't get it. Why can restricting UPEM reduce font size significantly, given
    the current font formats? I think they always use 16 bits to store a coordinate,
    no matter how many UPEM it is.

    smaller was an overstatement on my part. But even a little savings can make a

    coordinate values either in a byte or in two, depending on how big the value is.
    So a small UPM and hence smaller coordinate values may make a difference. I assume
    that <em>CFF</em>, with its different ways to represent integers, allows for similar
    optimization."

  body: "For a specific [text] size, a bitmapfont will always be smaller. The only
    exception\r\nmight be designs with long straight lines (not pretty). Think about
    it: a pixel in a\r\nbitmap font can be just one bit; in the worst case (if you
    go for subpixel rendering,\r\nwhich nobody has done yet AFAIK) a pixel would be
    3 bytes*. With outlines, even at\r\n1 byte per x/y coordinate you're looking at
    for example 8 bytes to define the smallest square. In practice of course you don't
    define an outline square for each pixel, but\r\nyou certainly need more than 3
    bytes per end-result pixel.\r\n\r\n* And this is only at the edges of the glyph.\r\nThe
    body of the glyph being solid, run-length\r\nencoding** compresses the data to
    near-nothing.\r\n\r\n** What would be great BTW is to compress the\r\ndata in
    vertical columns, since [Latin] glyphs\r\nhave long verticals but short horizontals.\r\n\r\nWhere
    outlines do save more space is if you reuse the same outline to generate\r\na
    large number of sizes; but you have to resort to hinting (and superhinting*)\r\nto
    coax the outlines to come close to what the bitmap would do. Also, if you\r\ndecide
    that text flow is paramount you have to abandon integer glyph widths,\r\nso bitmaps
    are out the window, but then the net result is ugly rendering.\r\n\r\n* The moving
    of an individual point in an outline glyph for one ppem.\r\n\r\nMore than saving
    space, outlines rule the land now because they save effort.\r\nTo me however this
    is a bit strange, because if you really want to save effort\r\nyou shouldn't be
    designing type in the first place!  :-)\r\n\r\n<strong>Here's the thing: are you
    making a large number of sizes, or a few?</strong>\r\n\r\nMore:\r\n- Bitmaps don't
    have to be blocky:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/manademo/\r\nAnd that's not
    even using subpixels.\r\n\r\n- CJK fonts as a rule use small UPMs, to save space.\r\n\r\n-
    Downer: I didn't realize an actual coarse grid was used! I always\r\nthought the
    segmentation was an effect applied at full Em resolution.\r\n\r\n- Carter/Charter:
    the way that design saved space was to use straight\r\nlines for short segments,
    thus eliminating control point data for those\r\nsegments. BTW, there have been
    font formats (most notably during the\r\nphototype era, but also used by URW to
    release lo-fi trial versions of\r\ntheir fonts) that feature straight lines only,
    and I believe [some] font\r\nrasterization algorithms [still] rely on this when
    the laser hits the film.\r\n\r\n- Amount of savings: one would expect 1-byte data
    to take up half the\r\nspace of 2-byte data, but because of compression this is
    not the case.\r\n\r\n- Hey, here's a crazy idea for saving more space: use lossy
    compression!\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIn direct competition to Gustavo (a friend from
    our Ultrafonts days, FYI :-)\r\nI will also offer to work with you. I guarantee
    we can nail down a killer way\r\nto deliver the best font rendering anywhere at
    the smallest filesizes. This\r\nmight actually involve outlines that mimic bitmaps
    exactly, but it's the\r\nspirit of the bitmap that shines through and delivers
    the goods.\r\nhpapazian at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nBTW, can you tell I love this
    stuff? I've been making\r\nscreenfonts since 1982, and I don't want to stop.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
