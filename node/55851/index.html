Don't know much about it unfortunately, it's a cafe in Brisbane, Australia. The people that manage the place didn't seem to want to help for some reason! I even bought an overpriced sandwich! Tried the free font identification websites but they didn't seem to prove successful. Any help would be much appreciated, even a similar typeface would help!

Cheers, Alex</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Simon about the Art Deco look, but this doesn't look familiar at all. Mark Simonson and Nick Curtis both hang out with specimen books from this era, and might have an idea. So far, I haven't found anything particularly close. It's an odd blend of serif, sans serif, and script. 

Seems like it could be a good project for a font, because vertical 'script' styles seem to always get a lot of attention.

		<div class="commentbody">Not that I thought it was particularly similar, but as an experiment I took Fluidum Bold and set the word Chelsea, then backslanted it 10 degrees. You can see how different the result is when you start with a script face, particularly considering the e, s and a. The cafe lettering is more like a backslanted italic that has been connected.

		<div class="commentbody">I have a theory that this is not a font, but a custom reworking of Bodoni and Bodoni Italic, with connectors added.

Here's why:

I've been working in the same genre for years - Jeanne Moderno (this week's typophile featured font! http://www.mehallo.com/introducing_jeanne/ ) is sort of a similar approach; and about 10 years ago, my first attempts to 'straighten out a Bodoni Italic' were simply killing the oblique angle and seeing what happens. 

And it looked a lot like the Chelsea treatment, only messier.

Some of the vertical strokes in Bodoni are not always consistent - which is why the h and the l in Chelsea are tilting slightly to the left. 

Then, in just de-obliquing, the rounded forms, such as the C, e and s really fall apart.

Then there is the decision: do I keep the dot-based terminals or not (in my fonts, I chose not to - it made everything look ... dotty)

So here it looks like the designer chose to keep the roman Bodoni e and a - then work on adapting the dots to the roman C and s.

And if you look closely, you can see they are a Roman C and s with the italic dots added (with sort of bumps where they connect).

The script strokes could have just been added later - and they seem too custom in this use to be part of a font that was drawn this way.

So this looks - to me - like a custom job.

If it is actually a font, I'd say the designer took an existing Bodoni, redrew parts and regenerated it. Which is a EULA violation.

One more:

There IS a straightened out Bodoni free font out there - I can't remember what it's called - that is similar to this, but it also has major problems in its rounded forms. Someone else may know what it is.

Hope that helps! 

I kind of like this look, personally would want to eat there some day. :)</div>

Thanks for all the great replies, I certainly didn't expect anything like the sort of response I've gotten so far!

After looking around at some fonts with bell terminals last night after I posted this I rediscovered Bodoni and started working with that. I'm not much of a typophile. 

I put Chelsea up on a grid once I'd fixed the perspective from the  photo and I didn't even notice the left tilt on the 'h' and 'l'. Great find. :)

A quick sketch I did for the project I'm working on. This is for educational purposes, not for profit or anything just in case anyone was wondering.

I'm not sure if I should have put this in another thread, it's no longer an ID but if one exist it will sort of answer this question as well. I want to reproduce the missing letters not create my own face.</div>

latest version. a few questions:

Is it okay that the 'S' and the dot on the 'i' is taller than the 'l'? If not, how would you suggest fixing this up?

Should the ball terminal be a similar size on the 'r' as to the dot on the 'i'? Should the dot exceed the width of the 'i' for balance or sit square?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes - and no. It's sort of designer's discretion. For the i, I would probably sit around for the longest time and move that dot up and down a bit, size it larger, then small then large again and again, moved right, then left then up then down until it just looked right.

Drawing this stuff is both mechanical and not. The not part is based on trusting your eyes - and if something doesn't look right, it isn't right. (something I attribute to Albrecht Durer). 

My eyes say the dot is too low to the i, but if moved up - it might be too high. You just have to futz with it until it works.

My eyes also say the t needs to be taller and the cross bar needs to stick out more on the right. And the l is a hair too wide, it is standing out too much compared to the i next to it.

With the S, there's a few ways to look at this: 

One, you're working with two different alphabets here. What we call 'upper' and 'lowercase' - and when using them together, one should either get the upper to match the lower more or take an initial cap (drop cap) approach: where the S is actually larger than the rest - as a beginning point for the word. The latter is the direction you're going in.

The other is to reduce the cap height of the S and let it flow better with the letters. The ascender on the l would then be taller than the S.

Want the ear on the g to match the r more. Look at some other lowercase g examples, there's some great ones out there. Bauer Bodoni comes to mind. :)

You're getting there - this one also takes into account white space, which is also very, very important. :)
