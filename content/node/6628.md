body: 'If anyone can identify this font, I would be very appreciative.  <BR> <BR>I
  know that it looks SO much like Goudy Handtooled, but it is not.  Here is why: <BR>
  <BR>- If you look at the serifs, such as the foot on the &#34;L&#34; and the &#34;E&#34;
  you will notice a difference. They are quite curved as opposed to angular. <BR>
  <BR>- The white areas inside each character are also quite different if you look
  closely. <BR> <BR>Any ideas??? <BR> <BR>Many thanks! <BR>DZYN <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48701.jpg"

  body: My guess is that this is a custom design. It looks like whoever did it started
    from the basic letterforms of Times Roman, made it a bit heavier, changed the
    period to a diamond, and added the hilites.

  body: The Co looks like it might be an actual font, although I can&#39;t place it,
    because the highlights are consistent and well drawn. Levi looks like someone
    added the highlights &#40;badly&#41; in Illustrator. They don&#39;t match at all.
