  forgery on type foundries.. I do not really know the facts but could someone please
  provide an explanation?\r\n\r\ni.e.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/bitstream2.pdf\r\n..why
  DID bitstream rename all their fonts... i.e. Bulmer, was remade as Transitional
  411.\r\n\r\nExcuse my ignorance on the topic, but I've seen these accusations and
  the general response is not to believe anything they says...?\r\n\r\nI guess this
  is a 2 part post:\r\nalso, what happens when a font design becomes public domain:
  \r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/publicdomain2.pdf\r\n\r\ncan anyone them
  make a revival?\r\n\r\ni.e. http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/7-league-gothic"

  body: "Hi John,\r\nwelcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\nAdam Twardoch has explained the
    Bitstream story <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/3003#comment-23904\">in
    an older thread</a>:\r\n\r\n<cite>[\u2026] in the 1980s, [\u2026] [a] group of
    type designers including Matthew Carter left Linotype and started Bitstream, which
    was to become the first digital type foundry in the world. They digitized original
    Linotype typefaces, but Linotype refused to license the original trademarks to
    them. So they used names derived from their own classification (Humanist 777 being
    Frutiger, Swiss 721 being Helvetica, etc.). Bitstream licensed the names from
    some other foundries, so some of the fonts used original names (e.g. Futura),
    but those copied from Linotype, Monotype and Berthold designs usually did not.
    However, these still were very faithful and high-quality digitizations, not cheap
    knock-offs like many many other companies offered them. [\u2026]</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>[In
    2003], Linotype and Bitstream signed an agreement which finally ended their dispute
    over the designs. Linotype officially \"licensed\" the designs to Bitstream (but
    not the trademarks). This means, that prior to that, Swiss 721 was an unlicensed
    clone of Helvetica, and now it's a licensed version of Helvetica, but sold under
    a different name. [\u2026] This is handy to know as this sort of confirms that
    the Bitstream versions really are derived from the same original sources.</cite>\r\n\r\nLater
    in this thread, others who (I believe) do know the ropes of digital type history,
    like John Hudson and Gerald Giampa, elaborate on this.\r\n\r\nFor your second
    question: it depends. If the design in question really is in the public domain,
    you might be allowed to do your own version, provided that you don\u2019t build
    upon someone else\u2019s copyrighted data, or use a name that is trademarked.
    Better get professional legal advice. \r\nHowever, the most important question
    remains: why \u2018design\u2019 something that already exists? Make sure to read
    [[John Downer]]\u2019s essay <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=2\">Call
    It What It Is</a>: <cite>\u201C\u2018Me Too\u2019 fonts, or \u2018Copy Cat\u2019
    fonts, as they are called, tend to focus on opportunism rather than on originality.
    These don\u2019t rate as revivals because they don\u2019t revive.\u201D</cite>"

  body: "Today, there is not much excuse for copying fonts, since fonts are sold in
    TrueType or Adobe Type 1 format for use on all sorts of equipment.\r\n\r\nBut
    the reason type designs were copied - by nearly every typographic equipment manufacturer
    - in the old days are simple enough.\r\n\r\nIf you were going to purchase a Monotype
    caster and keyboard, or a Linotype machine, or an IBM Selectric Composer, or a
    Compugraphic phototypesetter... if you couldn't use it to set Times Roman or Optima
    or Caledonia or Futura or Kabel, or any of the other fonts that were, at one time
    or another, all the rage... its usability would be very limited. Since, on the
    one hand, companies were loath to license their highly popular type designs to
    competitors (and it's not as if Linotype manufactured Monotype matrix-cases, or
    font discs for Compugraphic phototypesetters, and so on) - and, on the other hand,
    at least in the United States, <em>type designs enjoyed neither patent nor copyright
    protection</em>, well, they got copied.\r\n\r\nThe names of typefaces, though,
    <strong>did</strong> have trademark protection. So this is why so many alternative
    names for the same type design emerged."

    badly to such things. Then there's the small matter of the Linotype fonts appearing
    on MyFonts, being MyFonts top sellers for several years (Bitstream claiming to
    have been recognized by Linotype as their biggest reseller). This supports the
    belief that Linotype and Bitstream decided to bury the hatchet and form some kind

    type designs have enjoyed patent protection \u2014 specifically, design patent
    protection \u2014 in the United States for well over a century. In fact the very
    first design patent issued in the USA was for a typeface, in 1842.\r\n\r\nNow,
    design patents may be expensive, and offer a limited duration of protection, so
    most type designers might not bother... but they most certainly do apply to typefaces.
    They still apply today, or at least recently, as was demonstrated in the summary
    judgment of the Adobe vs SSi lawsuit.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "> criminals who deserve criminal penalties\r\n\r\nThe image to which you
    linked refers to copyright infringement. That is a tort, not a crime. Adobe and
    Linotype are permitted by law to sue people who infringe their copyrights, and
    that has to happen before enforcement takes place. Infringement for resale can
    indeed be a criminal act, and other crimes can be associated with copyright infringement
    in connection with obtaining access to the copyrighted work to copy it (i.e. in
    the case of movie piracy): but font designs are not copyrightable in the U.S.,
    so this is not relevant to those acts of font copying.\r\n\r\n> design patent
    protection\r\n\r\nTrue, I've seen some of these old design patents. My understanding
    was they failed to hold up in court as an effective way to protect font designs
    however, or, if they did work, they were limited to ornamental fonts and not basic
    text fonts."
