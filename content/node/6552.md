body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m designing layouts for a coffee-table book of very organic
  photomontages of the rainforest. Some images have text incorporated in them, and
  some may even have text that spills onto the page. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not a typographer
  by any means; but I love type and  I&#39;d so appreciate suggestions for a text
  face that could complement such images. Something versatile, with a nice big family?
  Flourishes... It may &#40;or may not&#41; even be appropriate to experiment with
  fleurons &#40;mmm...fleurons...&#41; to complement the face. <BR>Something like
  ITC Galliard? Anything by Lanston Type ? &#40;divine fleurons!!!&#41; I love their
  Jenson Oldstyle but I think I need something with true italics. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions
  you could give would be greatly appreciated! <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, <BR>Kaisa

    type incorporated into it? It would speed up the process

  body: 'I like it when the the content and typeface contrast. If the pictures are
    of  flowers or trees, and the face is a bit on the Jugend side, it gets too much.
    I would go for a nice modern text face, like Proforma, which has great abilities '

  body: When you say &#34;coffee table book&#34;, do you mean something where people
    won&#39;t actually read the text too much? I&#39;m not trying to be fascetious,
    it&#39;s just the nature of coffee table books - you could say the type becomes
    a texture, more than a carrier of language. <BR> <BR>I ask this because if readability
    is secondary that would affect the font choice. <BR> <BR>hhp

    part of the message. The two work together - it&#39;s not just a &#34;pictures

  body: do you know if you want a serif or a sans? <BR>Personally i would think a
    serif would make for a richer image. I would suggest Emigre&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mrs-eaves/"
    target="_blank">Mrs. Eaves</a> but it may be a bit overused &#40;and I hear its
    not to great for long passages of text&#41;. <BR>I would definately look at some
    stuff from <a href="http://www.stormtype.com" target="_blank">Storm</a>. I always
    get an exotic vibe from their stuff that i think would go well with a book on
    rainforests. Some suggestions from their library <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/serap.html"
    target="_blank">Serapion</a>, <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/mediaeval.html"
    target="_blank">Mediaeval</a>, <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/bibl.html" target="_blank">Biblon</a>,

  body: Yes, I quite like Barcleona but I might develop a nervous tic or something
    after setting or reading a bit of text in it.  I very much like Delicato, the
    suggested Storm fonts and Atma.  <BR>I&#39;d like to try to get an OpenType font
    so I can use lovely ligatures and such in InDesign easliy. But if it&#39;s a choice
    between a really exceptional font and a not-so OT font, I&#39;d choose the exceptional
    one.

    target="_blank">Jenson Pro</a>. It&#39;s OT and a dream to use in  <BR>InDesign.
    This was even mentioned a few weeks ago here in <BR>another thread during which
    Yves Peters and I soiled our pants  <BR>going on about the wonder of Jenson Pro&#39;s
    OT features. <BR> <BR>The design is a bit on the antique side, but if you&#39;re
    not worried  <BR>about being modern in this piece I think it&#39;s just the ticket.
