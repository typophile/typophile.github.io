  one of you geniuses know what this font is?\r\nIt's from the \"New Girl\" TV series
  and it looks pretty basic.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: To start the discussion and even if I'm pretty convinced that's not it, I'd
    say [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/akzidenz-grotesk|Akzidenz-Grotesk]] but that's
    really too small for my eyes. So, part of providing better samples (bigger, larger
    type sets...), I guess it'd be hard for (almost) everybody to help you out.

  body: 'You may be right :) What''s the sample origin? An online video I guess. And
    as I see the social network icons on the right, I guess you could share the link
    here as well. What about watching it again but full-screen and doing a snapshot
    at the maximum dimension you could get then cropping and posting the samples here? '

  body: Thank you very much Riccardo. Now I could say something less stupid than Akzidenz-Grotesk.
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/franklin+gothic|Franklin Gothic]] might work I
    guess.
