body: "Hello, my name is Richard, I'm a second year Graphic Communication student
  in the UK.  I've been making typefaces since college and have recently learnt how
  to put them together in Fontlabs, and this is my first completed typeface.  \r\n\r\nI
  started by looking at Futura and Universal, and I liked the simple geometric shapes
  that built up the letter-forms.  I tried to keep aspects of circles in the forms
  when possible.  \r\n\r\nPlease excuse the arrogant title, I wasn't in a creative
  mood when I named it.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/preview1_3494.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/preview2_3754.png]"

  body: "Well I think perhaps there isn't enough refinement in it. For instance, Futura
    really isn't so geometrically formed as it looks at first. The o's are actually
    somewhat condensed, and the horizontals are about 70 or 80 percent the thickness
    of the verticals. The rounded areas in many fonts tend to be somewhat thicker
    too.\r\n\r\nSome of the forms are a bit wobbly aside from that. I think the A
    is also definitely too condensed. The widths might also need refining.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I'm a beginner with this stuff, someone else probably knows better than I. Like
    the lowercase g, though. This would be interesting in a bolder weight.\r\n\r\nBri\xE4n"

  body: 'good start. although many of your curves need refinement and the letter thickness
    is not consistent. for instance, the d and o in dog feel thicker than the g, and
    the z in lazy feels thicker than the la and y. one problem is that you are using
    a varied line thickness on some letters and not on others. so, if you''re going
    to make your lowercase g vary in thickness, you need to also give the round part
    of your d and o a similar variation - that''s where the discrepancy in visual
    weight is coming from. you should knock out the letters arq&s and get them ABSOLUTELY
    PERFECT before moving on to the rest of the letters, otherwise you waste a lot
    of time going back and adjusting each letter. once you get those letters nailed,
    you can use those forms to create the majority of the rest of the letterforms. '

  body: "Thank you both for the comments, you make some good points, for this typeface
    I made the initial shapes in Adobe Illustrator due to my lack of Fontlab practise,
    but have since used more of the tools, and so I think I'm going to remake the
    typeface using Fontlab's tools.  \r\nR. Savage"

  body: 'There are good things but IMVHO, it needs a bit more love before anyone can
    really comment constructively. Decide which glyphs/characters you are happiest
    with and try to emulate the thickness of the strokes on that one. Say you think
    h is the benchmark because you want a stressed font: perfect the h (here the junction
    is too thick at the top for the glyph to be homogenous); then go through the letters
    you think are closest to that h benchmark, put them side by side (e.g. hah) and
    work on the a until you match the strokes visually; then move on letter by letters.
    Work with a pen next to you, just so you see what the ductus is and where there
    would be variations in the stroke.'
