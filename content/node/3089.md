  body: I agree. Identical letters are not identical.  <BR> <BR>However, I will look
    to see if it resembles a typeface from that era.

  body: It resembles Radiant in some of its Photo-Lettering forms, but that&#39;s
    about as close as I could find for thick-thin sans &#40;as Photo-Lettering called
    them&#41;. <BR> <BR>At least a few forms still live as digital fonts, such as
    the <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=AG61706201P1" target="_blank">PL
    version from Agfa</a> seen here at Phil&#39;s Fonts.

    a bit? &#40;This is just for a school project.&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help!
