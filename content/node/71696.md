  body: "It should match exactly, or there should be sufficient contrast.\r\n\r\nA
    close match: <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/beaufort.html\">Beaufort Extended</a>\r\n\r\nPlenty
    of contrast: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/craw-modern/\">Craw Modern</a>
    (Letterspaced.)\r\nThis would work well with the logo gold embossed.\r\n(\"Modern\"
    in this context means \"Didone\", not recent times.)"

  body: '#4, but I''d decrease the size of the logotype. And I might consider spacing
    it a bit.'

  body: "Well yes.\r\nI gave a couple of recommendations based on the layout shown
    originally, not the one subsequently shown -- which apart from type choice has
    an issue with not \"squaring off\" nicely."

  body: I really like the Sans-Serif you've chose but I feel as if something is still
    a tad off. It's probably the size and position of the logotype. I feel there is
    not much of a rhythm between the two elements. Perhaps give the logotype some
    more personality by playing around with it in terms of position and letter spacing
    etc. Would you mind if I asked you what this logo is for, it's very interesting.

    design and produce custom made chandeliers. The logo will be reproduced on some
    brass parts with engravoing and it must be simple."
