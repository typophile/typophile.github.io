  body: Draw a revival is probably the hardest work to do. This one would probably
    have benefited from an improved kerning. The caps appeared to have had more attention.  The
    /h should be a bit large, the c seems too much on his back side. The bottom /s
    is too big. However, I like the /r even thought it is a bit off. Keep going.

  body: "@sim - Thanks for the reference!\r\nOne major problem was the disparity in
    characters in different sizes.\r\nEach size was manufactured separately, sometimes
    with a very large difference in the proportions, and I needed to find a common
    solution which allowed us to use the font in both large and small sizes.\r\nThe
    second big problem was the \"dot gain\" and the poor quality of fingerprint.\r\nIn
    1913 the letters were made of soft metal, and they are deformed into small details
    when using ((((\r\nI will turn my attention to the problems mentioned by you. "

  body: "@hrant - Do not claim nonsense. More than 90 percent of the fonts can be
    used as a text font and as a display font.\r\n<strong>I do not mean to set a body
    text.</strong> But small pieces of text can be typed by these fonts, sometimes
    it's even necessary to make the text \"feelings\".\r\nHere is an excellent example
    of the use of Glass Antiqua in a small size\r\n\r\nhttp://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles22/961093/projects/3228405/6fc15f5ccecb27ad515273331e128da8.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The question is (for example in that setting*), does the\r\ndesigner want
    the different sizes to convey -as much as\r\npossible- the same feeling? Because
    -when they're from\r\nthe same font- they can't, since all details are rendered\r\nvery
    differently. And there's also a technical dimension:\r\nthe \"g\" seems to work
    OK large, but when it's small the\r\nbottom loop is clotting.\r\n\r\n* The larger
    size helps, thanks,\r\nbut the detail is still quite low.\r\n\r\nThere's no need
    to get upset - in fact it's a great\r\nopportunity to make -and sell- a small-size
    version!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
