body: What is your opinion on Monotype Garamond (which is installed with Microsoft
  Office)? It began to grow on me. I think it looks more 'authentic' than the popular
  Adobe Garamond. Of course they are completely different, but still.

  body: "This is an interesting point. It's very light, which gives it an air of refinement
    on first glance. But this is no sign of quality - it's a distortion. Fonts intended
    for body text are quite thick for a reason. Monotype's digitisation just doesn't
    have the feel of a book printed in metal type. Compare it to a book printed in
    any point up to the 1960s and you'll see it doesn't have the warmth and colour
    and clarity of print. At display sizes it might be nice, but a book in it would
    look spindly and weird. \r\n\r\nMore practically (and previous discussions haven't
    noted this), it's technically outdated, a product from 1995 that belongs there.
    No bold italic. No automatic ligature substitution. No small caps. No optical
    sizes.\r\n\r\nWhat I will note is that it's a very compact font file (as might
    be expected given its 90s origins), which makes pdf files created with it smaller.
    I once had a pdf document that was 900kb with [[http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/|EB
    Garamond]] condense to something like 100 when I switched to Monotype so the email
    would send faster. But this is not normally a big problem.  "
