  find anything that goes far enough.\r\n\r\nI am developing an OpenType version of
  one of my earlier fonts, using FontLab Studio 5 on Windows XP with Adobe Illustrator
  CS and InDesign CS for checking features and such. his is my second OpenType font,
  though the first one was developed using FontLab 4.5.\r\n\r\nI added all my extra
  glyphs, set up the classes and worked up a few basic features. I used the Preview
  in Studio, and everything worked fine. I generated the font -- PS-flavored OpenType.
  Install it. Started Illustrator CS, set some text in the font, tried the features
  (basic ligatures and fractions only). Everything worked. Exited Illustrator.\r\n\r\nBack
  in Studio then, I added several more features for small caps, oldstyle figures,
  stylistic alternates, etc. Features worked fine in Preview, so I generated the font
  again. Deleted the font from Windows fonts and installed the new one. Started up
  Illustrator and found no new features. Exited Illustrator and searched my hard drive
  for all the Adobe font cache files: \"adobefnt*.lst\", then deleted them all. Started
  up Illustrator again and still no new features.\r\n\r\nSo, what do I need to do
  beyond deleting those Adobe font cache files? What am I missing? I really need to
  get this project wrapped up. Any suggestions appreciated.\r\n"

  body: if it's still usable, it's still either in your Windows fonts folder (somewhere)
    or somehow it found its way to the adobe fonts folder (although i'm sure you would
    know it if it were in there). I'd go through your Windows fonts folder again and
    make sure it is NOT in there in ANY form.

    file exists only in my working folder, where I generated it from Studio. Not even
    lurking in the recycle bin.

  body: This just gets stranger and stranger! I deleted the only instance of the font
    on my hard drive (along with all the font cache files), and it's finally out of
    the list in Illustrator. However, now when I generate it again from Studio, the
    Windows preview shows absolutely no glyphs! It looks and works fine in Studio,
    and even fontQA reports only one minor error. I'll clear that up and search for
    anything on this new issue....

    cache files as well as all instances of the .otf file (making a backup under a
    different name).\r\n\r\nI still don't understand why I can't see my glyphs now
    even in Windows. When I generate the font as fontname2.otf (Font Name 2), everything
    works -- in Windows and in Illustrator. When I revert to using the intended name
    fontname.otf (Font Name), I get nothing. Is that a FontLab problem? A Windows
    problem? Or am I just missing something?"

    some extent it's true. If you use Windows Explorer to delete the fonts from the
    Windows fonts folder, Windows will automatically remove the \"font cache\" entries
    (i.e. the respective entries from the registry that hold the list of installed
    fonts). If you use a different method and just delete the files using, say, command
    line or some other application, or a script, then Windows will not automatically
    uninstall the font. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are cases where even logging
    off and on does not help. I hope that Linotype Font Explorer for Windows (when
    it's released) will include such a feature. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam\r\n"

    and cleanest option - if the font is in use Windows will tell you and not let
    you delete the font. However...\r\n\r\n1. Some apps may keep their own caches
    of font information which not be flushed when the font is deleted. \r\n\r\n2.
    Some table offsets may be cached by the system -  this is <B>only a problem if
    the font is replaced</B> with a different version of the same font. That's why
    good apps force a reboot when a font is upgraded. \r\n \r\n3. Some apps that delete
    fonts (possibly some font managers) don't delete fonts properly, or don't report
    to the user that the font is locked, or don't force a reboot when the font is
    replaced - all these scenarios can cause problems. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n"

    the system? or restart an application? or log off/log on? Sure seems like you
    should not have to restart the system just because you replaced a font. I would
    think there should be some way around that, but maybe not.\r\n\r\nSo a checklist
    when testing new versions of a font might be....\r\n\r\n1) Delete the font from
    the Windows Fonts folder.\r\n2) Delete all application/Adobe font cache files.\r\n3)
    Install the new version of the font in the Fonts folder.\r\n4) Test the font.
    Log off and log back in, if necessary.\r\n5) test the font. Restart, if necessary.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\ntim"

    Unfortunately there's no way around it, although problems rarely occur, when they
    do it's a bad experience for the user. For testing your own fonts I don\u2019t
    think you need to worry but you do if you're building a font installer that needs
    to upgrade (or downgrade) an installed font. \r\n\r\nHere's a note from the engineer...\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    first time I saw this, the font Tahoma was replaced and was in use by Microsoft
    Mail. About \xBD hour after the font was updated, suddenly all the lower case
    characters using that font would not display. </cite>  \r\n\r\nThe way we avoid
    this when testing is to give each instance of a font a unique production name
    eg \"Tahoma bld 112\" so we can test without worrying about this, and also compare
    versions installed on the same machine.\r\n"
