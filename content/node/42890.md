  the Type ID Forum posted a photo of signage at an airport terminal that turned out
  to be a small caps font. I searched for small cap, airport, terminal and combinations
  of of those words and came up empty.\r\n\r\nCan anyone point me to the original
  post? Thanks!\r\n\r\n"

    sure the photo was in color and taken outdoors, and certain it was a small caps
    font. I should have bookmarked it.\r\n\r\nI liked the font, and wouldn't have
    thought of using a small cap font for signage."

    wasn't an airport, no wonder I couldn't find it. Thank you to all who looked."
