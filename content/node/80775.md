    convey a similar feel in different scripts.\r\nThis version supports Spanish:
    http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/frankfurter-sb/\r\nFor Chinese/Japanese,
    there is a style called \"nar\" or \"maru\", with rounded terminals.\r\nFor Hebrew
    and Arabic, you could ask in the specialised boards of the forum:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/forum/373\r\nhttp://typophile.com/forum/366"

    So do many CJK ones. But skald89 specifically asked for a version of Frankfurter."

  body: "Thank you for your help. Must have been my fault I was not saying it had
    to be Frankfurter, just a font that would work with Frankfurter.\r\n\r\nAre there
    any free fonts that anyone can suggest. I have not looked at the fonts you have
    suggested yet, I will when in an hour. \r\n\r\nThank you!"
