  this typeface?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-11a_3644.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt
  should be an easy one, and I know it from somewhere but I can't seem to ID it from
  any of the faces I've tried\u2026\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nNat"

  body: "Could be, the image comes from a piece that displays a large number of different
    san serif typefaces, yet it's all set in one particular typeface, the one I'm
    after.\r\n\r\nIt could be that I've picked the profile of the typeface that it's
    set in by chance!\r\n\r\nThanks Conor"

  body: It's set in [[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1707|Myriad
    Condensed]], very similar to Frutiger (or Humanist 777 as it's called here) but
    there are differences, like the rounded dot and overal softer curves.
