  body: "Not sure \"NEW HOLLAND\" is a type, more probably a custom job. Part of loosely
    reminding of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/handel-gothic/|Handel Gothic]]
    (obviously because of the /E), the type looks very generic and not so memorable.
    I guess you could easily mimic it by keeping those flat-topped /E, /O and /D (which
    could have been done using the same letter shape).\r\nSome in the same vein: [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100041|Forza]]
    (\"just\" need to recreate this Handel-like /E with left half part of /O, extending
    top and bottom stroke and adding a middle one), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/domyouji/|Domyouji]]
    (bigger customization needed), [[http://fonts.gestalten.com/category/display/traffic-wide.html|Traffic
    Wide]]"
