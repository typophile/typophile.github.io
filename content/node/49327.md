  body: Well the C could be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bureau-grotesque/">Bureau
    Grotesque.</a>, and the D could be Clarendon, or another slab. A bit of a mess
    really!

  body: Yes, really. Since I had to recreate it, I traced the C in Illustrator and
    modified Clarendon to get the D. Thank you.
