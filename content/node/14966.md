body: "I am designing italics to fit with a roman, and I am having trouble knowing
  where to place the glyphs so that the word space looks right either side of a bit
  of italics in line with roman.\r\n\r\nSuppose I have a slanted rectangle glyph,
  as tall as the x height. If I set the sidebearings such that the baseline part of
  the glyph is central in the set width, then this glyph will look displaced to the
  right relative to upright glyphs, due to the rightward slant. So I offset the glyph
  to the left, such that the top sticks out to the right as much as the bottom sticks
  out to the left. I can then apply the same offset to all glyphs. The problem is,
  this simple formula does not work for all glyphs. For example, italic capitals can
  be modelled as a slanted rectangle as tall as the cap height, so these need more
  offset than the x height rectangle. Ascenders and descenders in the lower case have
  a similar effect, I think. Since the italics must be correctly spaced within themselves,
  the same offset must be applied to all italic glyphs, so a compromise of some kind
  is needed.\r\n\r\nIs there some standard formula for working out the offset from
  the italic angle and the vertical proportions (x height, ascender, cap height, etc),
  or is there some recommended test to help adjust the offset by eye?"

  body: "Thanks, Tiffany. I followed that thread when it was first introduced, and
    it does indeed contain a great deal of useful technical stuff about optical corrections
    required when creating obliqued shapes, with a good sprinkling of debate about
    whether italics should adopt a cursive style compared to the roman, and so on.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I have just re-read all the comments, and the particular problem I am looking
    at now did not appear to be addressed. I am just thinking that this is another
    one of those 'gotchas' that type design appears to be full of, and that, given
    the long history of type design, it was no doubt sorted out centuries ago by someone
    far more clever than I am."

  body: You also have to consider punctuation. You'll often need to have italic text
    followed immediately be upright punctuation, like a comma or period, etc. With
    that in mind, I'd say the spacing at the baseline is probably more important.

    between the baseline and the x-height of the roman and italic align, like this:\r\n<code>\r\n_________________
    x-height\r\n.....|.../ \r\n.....|../\r\n.....|./\r\n.....|/\r\n.....|\r\n..../|\r\n.../.|\r\n../..|\r\n./...|
    \  _________ baseline\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThere's really no way to make every combination
    between roman and italic fit perfectly. Lowercase-to-lowercase would seem to be
    the most common situation, so that's why I do it this way. \r\n\r\nPunctuation
    is not really a problem except in a situation where you have roman followed by
    italic punctuation in which case the punctuation will be a bit too close. The
    reverse situation is probably more common--italic followed by roman punctuation.
    In that case, the punctuation will be spaced a little loose, which I think is
    okay. In any case, the rule I learned years ago about typesetting is that, with
    rare exceptions, punctuation should match the style that precedes it."

  body: "\"the same interserif spacing as the Roman\"\r\n\r\nThe interserif space
    (i.e. the space between the serifs of two adjacent H's), should be about the same,
    or slightly less than the Roman...if there are no serifs, well, then the space
    between italic H's should be slightly less than the roman space between H's...\r\n\r\nThere're
    two things: getting the basic H space, (and n space), fromRoman to Italic, and
    determining how and which way to offset either the upper, or lowercase, or both.
    I space the Uppers as I've described, and offset the lowers to the left...\r\n\r\nThe
    fundamental principle is rooted in the following: you really do want to center
    the Roman by itself, don't you?, you really cannot effectively offset into the
    word space, can you, and you can't control any interfont spacing, thus: if the
    italic caps are not centered between romans, they never will be...and that is
    the basic need because the l.c. can only look bad if too far right...and this
    you can see a lot of these daze.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, David. Am I right in thinking that the interserif space idea refers
    to letter spacing within the italics, to make the italic letter spacing match
    that of the roman? That is another problem from the italic offset, I think, though
    it is also interesting, as the different lower case serif shapes and placements
    in roman and italics give rise to different spacings to the main stems, and it
    is typically only in the capitals that the serifs are the same in italic and roman.\r\n\r\nLooking
    at the offset point, I gather that you would place the alignment line (as shown
    in John's attachment) at half of the cap height, so an italic 'H' would be centered
    between two roman 'Hs'. Your alignment line is therefore higher than that suggested
    by Mark, Thomas, and John, which is a bit above half the x height. I would have
    thought that lower case words and phrases embedded in roman sentences (the most
    common case?) would look displaced too far to the left with your choice of offset."

  body: "Glyn, I don't think you've translated the 'Berlownese,' as John Hudson calls
    it, correctly. The italic H will have the same or slightly less space between
    the serifs--and stems, as these are the same shape on both sides of the H. The
    italic H should also be centered between the side bearings, if I understand him
    correctly. But the n will be offset to the left of center between its side bearings
    in order to center between two H's. This will put the n somewhere in the neighborhood
    of where Mark and John will put it according to their rules. But it may be different
    from font to font, according to the design. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the italics may
    be spaced relative to the italic H and n. Did I get it right, David?\r\n\r\np.s.
    Just testing with an italic I am working on now, David's method made the side
    bearings of the italic n equal with the guideline at 63% of the x-height--about
    the same as Thomas's method, for this particular design, anyway"

    In the case of an italic I am working on, I have a bit of difficulty with David's
    method, as I have not designed any italic capitals yet. I will do at least the
    'H', and see what happens.

  body: "I hadn't before considered the roman-italic spacing question in the terms
    David suggests, but I can see the sense in beginning with spacing the italic H
    so that it centres between roman Hs. As David says, if you use any other approach,
    the italic H will always be offset to the left or right (unless the design happens
    to have very short caps, in which case one might get close to a centered H following
    my recommendation or Thomas'). The problem I have with this approach, though,
    is that if you do centre the H, you end up with the lowercase offset to the left.
    When a word is set in italics within roman text -- or in roman within italic text
    --, I like the space before and after the word to be equal. Following David's
    recommendation, an italic word drifts to the left. Also, depending on the design,
    the italic letters may noticeably protrude into a left margin defined by roman
    letters above and below. For me, the whole question is really what aspect of mixed
    text setting you wish to compromise.\r\n\r\nAn illustration to these thoughts

    1992, just previous to my having deciding I'd seen everything, a client came and
    told me they were going to set headlines made of alternating Roman and Italic
    letters (in a Transitional typeface). The spacing method I've described was Norbertequesly
    old by then, but it worked in what I think we could agree was perhaps the most
    extreme \"useful\" case. I.E. mixed words of 12 or 13 degree italics would be
    more extreme but not likely to be tasty on the eyes. I absolutely know of other
    methods well enough to tell you when they Could be used (quite often), and when
    they Will fail (rarely). With enough experience you can use any number of methods
