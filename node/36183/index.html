I'm looking for an extern HDD that's fast and reliable.
I'm think of purchasing a 500GB, any tips for me?

		<div class="commentbody">Most any major brand will have the same % chance of failure or not. I love laCie drives, but I had one crap out on me last year, so I've kept my eyes open to other brands -- I haven't given up on laCie, but i've got a LOT of their drives, so the odds just caught up with me. I have talked to one tech (who worked on my drive's recovery) who said he (and his co-workers) were leery of laCie because they don't include enough ventilation, so they get pretty hot (specifically their larger 4-drive mechanism enclosures, th bigger disk and extreme disk cases).

Basically, you should be looking at 
a) capacity/form factor (how much will it store in how many drives... some 500 GB drives actually have two 250 GB mechanisms inside, that's twice the chance to fail); 
b) Warranty/track record (is it a fly-by-night upstart or a known name like laCie or Wester Digital)
c) Interface (Firewire 800, 400, USB 2.0 or 1.1, etc) - the faster the interface, the faster the throughput (usually)

Finally, you can save $$ by checking for deals - drives are getting faster/bigger/cheaper every month, it seems. I just got an email from MacMall, they're selling the laCie d2 Quadra 500GB for only $189 (good price for a laCie).

		<div class="commentbody">All you can know about any harddrive is that it will fail. The question is when. It could fail instantly or never, or at any time in between. I use the LaCie d2 drives because they are mechanically solid, and the interfaces are reliable, fast, quiet, and very compatible. That's all you can hope for when you buy an external harddrive.

I just had a 250GB LaCie d2 drive fail, but I have a solid BACK-UP strategy that is actually working, so that event was expected and trivial.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There's a lot to say about HDD’s, eg that the ‘big brands’ use drives from different manufacturers in their enclosures and are not really open about what they use.
For almost fifteen years I bought and used LaCie equipment until one drive gave up on me (apparently because of a bad powerbrick). After this I changed policy: I kept up with testreports in magazines (in my case German ones are favoured because they are so thorough), bought the best drives recommended, and put them in top brand enclosures.
I always backed up twice, to two separate drives. And I burned DVD's of all the data I could not reconstruct (with two copies of each backup-DVD).
Nowadays I'm on an extended sabbatical, but I plan to go back to work soon. When I do, I will go for the safest way of backing up: use a redundant Raid-array, make DVD-backups and put compressed files on the Internet (storage is cheap nowadays — and I plan on using Google as well as DotMac).
