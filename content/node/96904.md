body: "Hi Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm currently designing a brand for a corporate client,
  in the vein of the new Avois or Eurostar brands. It's shiny, fast, car badge-esque
  etc,  but not so much that it shouldn't appeal to a family friendly/female market,
  and I need suggestions for a corporate font. Criteria includes: \r\n\r\n- Must be
  by a reputable foundry\r\n- Not be overused already (my biggest problem)\r\n- Be
  fairly recent (in the last 2-4 yrs?)\r\n- Available from MyFonts as a webfont or
  TypeKit\r\n- Have enough quirks to be used as a header font but also for text (not
  essential - if its not suitable for text we can specify a second font)\r\n- Contain
  multiple weights and italics\r\n- Price range is up to about $50-60 AUD \r\n- Stylistically
  in the vein of Klavika / Clio / Square sans / Rubrik (Newlyn) / FS Joey etc\r\n-
  If possible with half rounded terminals, i.e., going to a point on one side and
  not the other. See attached for an example. Again, not essential!\r\n\r\nI know
  this is a lot to ask, but any help would be much appreciated! Thanks in advance
  guys.\r\nMatt"

    brand apart, if you dare. It\u2019s certainly not overused, but it is an awesome
    design. Most other \"experimental\" sans serifs just employ a cheap trick and
    leave it at that. This on the other hand \u2026 It could work especially well
    if you pair it with one of his other more muted designs (like the prev. poster
    suggest.)\r\n\r\nThat said, be careful when selecting fonts for text on the web.
    The quality varies."

    a \u201Creputable foundry\u201D is apparently the most grave condition, you may
    think about approaching Dalton Maag in London.\r\nAnd take the licencing costs
    into account, if you haven\u2019t done so already."
