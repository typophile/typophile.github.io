  body: Looks like Bodoni to me.  Specficially, Bauer Bodoni Condensed, I think. The
    funny little tail on the g is the giveaway.

  body: "I think it's actually Linotype Didot rather than a Bodoni. The curve of the
    upper part of the bowl of the \"a\" is a tell-tale sign.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/didot/linotype-didot-bold/testdrive.html"

  body: "I had a more thorough look at the covers and I think the closest you'll get
    is Paratype's Bodoni.  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/bodoni/\">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/bodoni/</a>
    It has the right x-height and almost the same glyph set.\r\n\r\nThe suggested
    Linotype Didot doesn't quite match -- it lacks the upward \"ear\" in the italic
    g from the word Krieg -- and this is the one characteristic I find makes these
    covers so intriguing..... Though I agree that the lowercase \"a\" doesn't quite
    match with the Bodoni I'm suggesting."
