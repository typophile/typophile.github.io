  a story-telling fantasy friendly family of fonts. It is a warm face that looks like
  the spoken word, perfect for tall tails, fantasy-world adventure books, creative
  writing, and poetry. Dez Petranian includes multiple language support, nearly 1,200
  glyphs, stylistic sets, and many alternates. Think of it as a warm reminder of real

  body: "I approve of creating some more typefaces to fill this particular niche;
    fantasy books are popular, but they are usually typeset in faces like Times Roman
    - it shouldn't just be children's story books that make an effort to match the
    atmosphere of the story.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are existing typefaces suitable
    for such use, but it just doesn't seem to happen.\r\n\r\nNow, though, with the
    name of the typeface, I had expected it to support Armenian!"

  body: "I intended it to be more of a Roman inference.  The name comes from 2 sources:\r\n1.
    Petra, Greek word for stone, a tribute to Sumner Stone.\r\n2. Roman-Latin \"ian\"
    as in many names from ancient times as well as more modern fantasy hers."

  body: "Incidentally, seeing a typeface intended to promote the right mood for reading
    a work of fantasy led me to speculate on what the best typeface would be for a
    book containing nonsense presented as fact... one that would serve as an anaesthetic
    to the reader's critical faculties. And then I recalled the thread a while back
    on an article claiming that too-good typography did just that!\r\n\r\nAn investigation
    of the typography used for the works of Le Plongeon, Churchward, von D\xE4niken
    and Sitchin now suggests itself...\r\n\r\nTypography Is Dangerous!"
