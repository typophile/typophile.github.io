    version devoid of the shadows and textured background. Helps one focus on the
    shapes of the letters better. '

  body: I like it overall, but I would have been inclined to disconnect the swash
    from the O as to avoid it looking like a Q at first glance.

  body: I don't like the suddenly rising baseline, and there are some legibility issues
    (Qelair? Qdair?) With a new and made-up (?) name like this, especially one that
    doesn't follow orthographic expectations (no u after q), I think you want to be
    pretty obvious with the legibility.

  body: "Its been a long time, I know. Anyway\u2026\_they almost didn\u2019t care
    how legible it was. The word doesn\u2019t mean anything and it seems a little
    fashion upscale to have a logo that is curious at a glance, but obvious once you
    know the name. There are lots of fashion places that have names that are hard
    to read like Bvlgari and that Oprah logo is indiscernible but you know it is hers.\r\n\r\nThen
    again\u2026\_they went out of business! Zoinks!"
