  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm really touched how much everyone liked typecon. It is truly amazing how this conference and organization has grown. For those of you who weren't at the first 2, (I don't think anyone here except maybe Kent has,) you wouldn't believe it. It used to be about 30 people gathered in a room talking about type, and then going out for Chinese food at a groovy Polynesian resturant.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since this is my first foray into Typophile, I'd like to say hello to everyone! I think that these forums are an excellent way to increase awarness and spread the good word about type. Again, I'd like to add my 2 cents about how good TypeCon 2003 was. My head's still spinning! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hello to all, and especially to Hrant, who doesn't deserve all the negative attention he receives.</div>
