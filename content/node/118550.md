  etc) with round punctuation but not rounded terminals on the letterforms? I took
  a look at the similar fonts recommended by Identifont and didn't see anything...\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    would happily produce something custom as a commission. Can't think of an existing
    face off the top of my head.

  body: Directors Gothic is awesome, but a little too squarish. I think Novecento
