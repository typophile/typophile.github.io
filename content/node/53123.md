  a way to ID a font.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help.   I have found fonts
  similar, but not the same.  I am having problems IDing it because I don't have many
  characters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aces1_5810.gif]"

  body: Well, this looks like a logo that was based on an existing typeface. If so,
    the letter A has been modified. But then again, all 4 letters of the logo may
    have been custom-drawn. They wouldn't be that hard to create in a vector program
    like Adobe Illustrator.

  body: "Ok, I rebuilt this part of the logo.  The company is a branch of this company
    called EnviroACES.   So I need to do the \"Enviro\" part in a similar font.  Can
    anyone suggest a font that is at least fairly close to the \"C,E,S\" characters
    in the logo so I could use it as a reference point for the rest of the characters?\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot."

  body: "OK... So if you rebuilt it, you had something you started with. Maybe it
    was a really tiny, pixellated JPEG, but if you posted it here, you might get some
    more answers. :-)\r\n\r\nIf you need help with how to post an image, go <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/18067\">here</a>."
