  body: Whitney, by HF&J ( www.typography.com ) has to be the most legible font I
    can think of - ever. It's probably one of my favourites too!

  body: "If the text is for extended reading I don't think a sans, even an excellent
    one like Whitney will be as readable as a good serif. Fedra Serif, for example,
    would be a good candidate for small sizes. \r\n\r\nIf this is a reference like
    a dictionary or timetable, where one is looking up specific information, and only
    reading a short bit of it, then a sans may be OK. "

  body: For best legibility, stay with serif. The best legibility at 9pt, in my experience,
    is ITC Stone Serif with oldstyle figures (available from ITC, not Adobe). Also,
    Sabon, though its x-height is not as big. Stone Serif is a stupendous three-weight
    workhorse that is not over-exposed. Also, look at Freight Serif, Bitstream Arrus,
    Celeste, Haarlemmer, Stempel Garamond, and Warnock.
