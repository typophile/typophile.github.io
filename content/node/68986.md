body: "Am working on my portfolio for design school reviews and wanted to create a
  'mark' to represent me. Did something really simple and solid - My initials AR.
  Wanted the mark to be solid so that it can work well independently as well as when
  layered over patterns and textile print designs.\r\n\r\nWill add my name beneath
  it..This is the first time I've tried to design a logo from scratch. This is sort
  of a crude illustrator trace from my sketch. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.."

  body: "It\u2019s plumb. It cries for more symmetry, especially with regard to the
    width of the two letters. And the combination of lower case and uppercase does
    not work here, at least not actually. And the strokes are unclean. I mean, they
    vary in a unnatural way. Really, because I don\u2019t see potential for improvements,
    because there is too much wrong, I recommend to draw it on paper and then to optimize
    it in Illustrator, especially if you are not experienced in Illustrator."

  body: "The forms are sortof strange, but your initials, AR have a lot of potential.
    The mixing of lowercase/capitals doesn't really work here but it is possible and
    can turn out really nicely.\r\n\r\nI think your issue at the moment is that your
    glyphs are just way too diffrent, and especially the R looks strange, the stroke
    that is forming the leg is pasted on and makes the form feel bulky.\r\n\r\nThink
    first on what kind of style you want to use for your branding/monogram, stick
    with the modern style ? then I'd try to come up with some more interesting shapes
    and the balance of the letters."

  body: Wow I just found this site no longer than 5 minutes ago.  I am actually having
    the same exact issue as you, because my initials are AR and I am currently working
    on a personal logo myself.  I actually think the LOGO is perfect it just needs
    to be skewed or distorted.  It seems like your trying to be symmetrical and if
    that is the case you could try reflecting either the A or the R across the Y axis
