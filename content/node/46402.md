  body: "Johnston (and New Johnston) were amongst the ones I rejected, but thanks
    for the thought.\r\nI have also looked at the obvious contenders Agenda, Metro,
    Bliss, Geometric 415 etc\r\nThe jpeg has made the underside of the beard of the
    G seem a bit straighter than it really is.\r\n\r\nTim"
