body: "Is there a term that describes written speech that indicates overly enthusiastic
  or elongated pronunciation? For instance, a baseball announcer who transforms the
  word \"strike\" into several syllables and takes extra seconds to finish the word.\r\n\r\nI
  am looking for samples of this in print and I can't figure out how to search for
  the phenomenon since I can't explain it in a few words or less. \r\n\r\nSome words
  that come to mind are \"strike\" or \"goal\" or \"excuse me\" ala Steve Martin.
  Also various swear words.\r\n\r\nI'm also wondering if there is a common method
  for indicating this in print. Is putting a hyphen between each character sufficient
  or does one need to double up the characters as I did in the title above? Does the
  word have to be in all caps or can lower case work? Is it important to try to add
  letters (stee-rike) that don't exist in the original word in order to emphasize
  the mispronunciation?\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!\r\n\r\nKristin"

  body: Hyphens between letters can also indicate spelling out the word (though I
    guess the context would usually make clear which effect was intended).

  body: "Gotta envy Japanese for the dash used to lengthen vowels in Katakana. You
    can use multiple ones of these, too, if you want to get expressive.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zaaaaaaa_5177.jpg]\r\nIn
    the Latin alphabet, personally, I'd do double vowels rather than hyphens. But
    really only vowels and maybe fricatives or approximants. There's really no way
    to \"stretch out\" a plosive I think, so doubling the \"T\" and \"K\" in \"STRIKE\"
    seems beside the point."

  body: "no clue what the term is, if such a term exists. I do however have a method
    that I have seen and follow myself for these expressive elongations:\r\n\r\nSTEE-RIIII-KE!\r\n\r\nto
    me, the hyphens make the odd spelling readable and emphasize the modified syllables.
    I'm afraid I have no references to offer. with expressive typography, rules are
    of only minimal use anyway."

  body: "These are great comments. \r\n\r\nI also think it might be useful to see
    whether there are conventions for this in the production of comic books. Maybe
    there's a Chicago Manual of Comic Book styles? Typeset in Comic Sans?\r\n\r\nPlainclothes,
    the term \"expressive typography\" is helpful. I hadn't even gotten to that. Thanks!"

    prosodic.\r\nBut with just one letter repeated, which doesn't affect the pronunciation,
    then it just looks prolonged.\r\n\"Strrrrrrrrrrrrrike!"
