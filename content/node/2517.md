body: Dear Sirs, <BR> <BR>as a Project Manager in A Shipyard in South of France, I&#39;m
  managing a retrofit of a 52 meters yacht including a general painting of the boat.
  The inscription name at the stern has been sanded by painters and I only have photos
  of the name. My usual contractor making permanent film is unable to find the correct
  font. Could you please help me in my quest. I apologize in advance for the photos
  attached wich maybe are not explicit about the font. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22914.jpg"

  body: I am thinking it looks a lot like Monotype&#39;s &#34;Bell&#34;. That&#39;s
    what I used to make the attachment.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22919.gif"

  body: Now that I see them closer together, I am not so sure. The serifs on the E
    and L don&#39;t look right. I used the Semibold weight of Bell. Maybe lighter
    weight would look closer?

  body: Thank you Mike for your help. The top extremities of the T are more open as
    well. Do you think is it a Bold series ? <BR>Your proposal looks closer than the
    New Baskerville Bold and Perpetua Bold my contractor proposed me.

  body: Seems a lettering job to me. The forms of the serifs at the end of the E bars,
    and others are not typical of a true Serif text face, they are too small and too
    direct a mechanical copy of the regular serif. <BR> <BR>The overall seems visual
    a mixture of Times, Caslon and others! But yes, Bell or Miller can be a good replacement.
