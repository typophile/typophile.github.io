  Now I am working on Preto Semi.\r\n\r\nIt is an experimental text type, where I
  am working with serif, changing their function and trying to create a \"better sans
  with some contrast\". The serif is placed on the position, where it is logical to
  fill empty spaces (making the color of the text more even), or when the thin lines
  need serif to balance contrast, or serifs are placed on end strokes.\r\n\r\nLook
  at the pdf in the attachment.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/preto-semi-typophile_6600.png]"

    Keep it up, and don't let old-fashioned people discourage you.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    in terms of \"filling space\":\r\n- It's only part of what serifs do (and to me
    not a central part).\r\n- Is that really what/all you're doing? Looking at the
    \"w\", there must be more.\r\n\r\nBTW, you might like to analyze (but not imitate)
    Rotis Semi-Serif, since Aicher was also interested in leveraging serifs functionally,
    and not according to their circumstantial origins.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks. I am actually planing to finish it, because it looks nearly refined
    to me.\r\nBut I posted it to this forum, if there are some fatal/minor adjustments
    to be made...\r\n\r\nIt actually started as project how to make rotis semi serif
    \"better\", or inspired by.\r\n\r\nYes, the function of the serif is not filling
    the space. I just change their function for my purposes, and I am trying to keep
    serifs on baseline to have more \"consistent baseline\" than in some other semi-serif
    fonts (rotis and themix).\r\n\r\nI was mostly curious how people will read the
    small texts in the pdf attachment. Some people I showed them samples, at first
    they were very surprised and claim it very disturbing. After some time, they adapted
    and they don't see them. Usually new type of type need a time to \"became\" readable
    to our eyes. But some of them still have a problem after time :)"

  body: "Getting useful feedback is a classic paradox, especially for a text face.
    The people who can potentially give you some great advice -type designers- are
    tainted by having their own ideas of how it should be done*; this is pretty much
    a death trap for something that tries to innovate. And the people who can give
    you the <em>best</em> advice -actual readers- cannot do so explicitly; you're
    not supposed to point out anything at all to them - certainly not that the font
    is trying to innovate...\r\n\r\n* And creative people are not good at putting
    themselves in other people's shoes.\r\n\r\nSo you have to listen to everybody
    with an open mind, but see clearly what's in your own mind, and follow that. And
    this is what makes me hesitate to give you more advice, at least in terms of where
    to [not] put serifs. One thing I will opine though is that the weight difference
    between the Regular and Bold is too great*. I think your Regular is only slightly
    light, so I might recommend keeping that as is and making a Bold that's less dark.\r\n\r\n*
    Coming back to Aicher, I guess you don't agree with his philosophy for a Bold.
    I myself actually do.\r\n\r\nBTW, you might want to look at Swagg, although it's
    not hugely relevant.\r\nhttp://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/swagg/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yes. Probably I am myself conservative as well. :) But posting it here helped
    me to think about it...\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\n(I think
    I already saw Swagg before.)\r\n\r\n*I dont have knowledge about Aicher's Bold,
    so I will look at it.\r\n\r\nAnd you are right about the weights. But actually,
    here I displayed Regular and Black weights (medium and bold will go in between
    them)."
