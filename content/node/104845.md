  compared to the one on left.\r\n\r\nI'm also looking for the earliest examples of
  fonts with this kind of design at that part of the letter /u/. How old could the
  practice of designing the letter /u/ or /n/ with this specific style be or it has
  been there since the beginning of sans-serifs? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/u_4599.gif]"

  body: The original question is unclear. Does it refer to the white space (yes, nick
    is a good word for this) or to the stem section (what I would call, in both letters,
    a spur)? Hence  I would describe the one on the right as a nicked spur.

  body: "A spur is a tiny serif that implies an entry into the stroke with some sort
    of engraving tool.\r\n\r\nI think you should call it a \"sevag\"."
