  body: "I see that there is a large number of fonts matching this logo, \r\nwith
    little or no variations at all:\r\n\r\n<strong>Heather</strong> - (c) 1992 by
    Mike Allard for De Nada Industries\r\n<strong>Hellenic</strong> - (no copyright
    in font or file)\r\n<strong>Dahrlin</strong> - Digital Data from The WSI-FONT

    Arts & Letters Corporation\r\n<strong>Arabella</strong> - (c) Typographer Mediengestaltung,
    2000\r\n\r\nI don't know how is this possible... I suppose that only one brand/person
    should have the actual copyright at each specific time no?.\r\nSo much ripp-off?\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    based on the kerning I assume that your logo is created with <strong>Heather</strong>\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/heather.font?text=Paravicini+Italian+Bistro\r\n"
