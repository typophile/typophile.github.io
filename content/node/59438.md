  body: "First one is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/garamond/\">Monotype
    Garamond</a>, various weights and italics.\r\n\r\nThe second one I couldn't easily
    identify, but it's obviously something DIN-flavored and with a \"true\" italic,
    so very likely recent."

    use a descriptive title next time! Thank you."</a> Seriously, it just makes it
    very hard for us to ever find these threads again when they''re named something
    like "help" or "two fonts" or "ID". :-)'
