    By: Marcox!\r\n\r\nThe \u201CAfrica\u201D typeface was inspired by the type on
    old National Geographic maps of the 1950s and \u201960s. The digital version was
    created for and first used by National Geographic Traveler when that magazine
    went through a redesign 4 or 5 years ago. Michael Grossman (Saveur, Entertainment
    Weekly, Real Simple, Absolute) did the revamp.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3065/is_2002_August_1/ai_89972569\r\n"

    he is the designer of the type in question.'
