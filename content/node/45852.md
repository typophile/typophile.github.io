body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear your comments on this typeface. I know it needs
  work, but I'm not exactly sure which quirks are \"features\" and which are \"bugs\".\r\n\r\nIt's
  opentype with a few ligatures (mostly ones needed to get this particular text looking
  OK) and a couple contextual alternates. It's my first attempt at OT.\r\n\r\nBTW,
  I just noticed the second attachment was marked 2 June 2007, which is impossible,
  so I fixed that."

  body: To me, it almost seems as though the lowercase and uppercase are from two
    entirely different families. I really like the caps. They sort of have a feeling
    close to Filosofia Grand (albeit italic), looking classic and refined, while the
    lowwercase have this quirky, playful characteristic about them. I think the curved
    terminals and ball serifs are making the rest of the letterforms seem a little
    more whimsical, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The kerning on the lowercases
    seems a little tight in most cases too. Is the "gg" a ligature? It seems as though
    the overlap isn't quite right. The width of the bottom loop may require it to
    be ligated. The bottom of the bottom loop also looks a little dark to me, along
    with the first vertical stroke on the lowercase w. The tittles and punctuation
    seem a little heavy to me as well.

    is too tight now.\r\nWhy did you call it \"Magnolia\" ?"

  body: "Chipman223:\r\n\r\nI see what you mean about the caps and lowercase. Maybe
    I'll separate the caps out and do something different with them. Whimsy was my
    intention, though, so I'll work on the lowercase for now.\r\n\r\nI'm going to
    work on spacing now.\r\n\r\nYou're right, the 'g' and 'w' do have weight issue.
    No, 'g' is not ligated -- that might change.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nAlessandro:
    I'm glad you like it. I'm not entirely sure why I called it Magnolia. Perhaps
    I was aiming for the combination of lightness, neatness and prettiness that magnolias
    have."

  body: "i like the contrast on the tail of g, it's attractive (maybe too attractive
    for body text though?) The word 'higher' looks lovely.\r\nI might try making the
    t taller, k narrower on top arm (or waist more slanted), second arm of w starting
    a bit higher, and work on getting the shapes more even in colour and contrast.
    \r\nthere's a lot of potential here i think, really nice."

  body: I've respaced, adjusted k, t, q, tittles, and added an alternative g to substitute
    for the second one in "gg". I'm not sure if it's the right altervative, though.

  body: "I've made dozens of tweaks since the last update (29 revisions recorded in
    version control). Highlights include: a complete set of numerals, an exclamation
    mark and a new question mark, improved spacing and a new 'w' (is this an improvement?
    I'm personally thrilled to be rid of the old one).\r\n\r\nIs this going somewhere?
    Am I on the right track with spacing? I can't bear to look at the original now,
    but I don't know if the current version is acceptable either.\r\n\r\nThe sample
    is here: [[http://typophile.com/files/sample_7.pdf]]"

  body: "All those tight curls are kind of too fiddly to my eye - I find it more attractive
    at small sizes where that detail drops out - but that's really a personal preference,
    not an objective flaw.\r\n\r\nShape of 'w' is improved, but its same-but-different
    top serifs make me do a double-take.\r\n\r\nSpacing is much improved.\r\n\r\nIs
    'r' too wide? Should its arm branch out lower on the stem?\r\n\r\n'4' looks less
    like a four and more like Prince's next name! ;-)\r\n\r\nShould '6' and '9' have
    some kind of terminal on their loose ends?\r\n\r\nBeginning and end of '8''s stroke
    don't relate happily to each other in position.\r\n\r\nI think your ligatures
    are fantastic!\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the comments, Craig. I've changed the middle serif of the 'w'
    to match the left one (I think I was trying to compromise between the left and
    the right, but perhaps that was a bad idea). Thanks for the 'r' suggestion: I
    think that's a big improvement.\r\n\r\n<em>Beginning and end of 8's stroke don\u2019t
    relate happily to each other in position.</em>\r\n\r\nPersonally, the '8' is my
    favourite of the numerals; I agree that's \"fiddly\", but that's part of the look.
    Do you have any concrete suggestions on how the ends might meet more happily?\r\n\r\nOnce
    again, thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nI now have Windows-1252 coverage, as well
    as Latin-3 (because I'm an Esperanto speaker)"
