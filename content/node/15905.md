    don't know if we're going to find this one, but maybe we can get you some in the
    same vein. For starters, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.2780.10.19&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Wyoming+Avenue&sampleSize=48\"

  body: "I honestly don't know how old this is. A client sent it in for us to scan,
    but the quality just isn't there to get a decent print. So we want to re-typeset
    it. If that means buying it for our own library so be it.\r\n\r\n"

    of a New York reference. 5th Ave? Uptown? something may jog loose in my old brain.
