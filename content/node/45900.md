  body: "This is a tough one. The P has a small counter and the S serifs are blended.
    At first I thought some Garamonds have the same kind of W, and the S serif is
    similar, but the P was the problem.  The closest font I could find that seemed
    close to the W, P and S was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/rotation/|Rotation]],
    but it seems to have less bracketed serifs. Either squooshing (horizontally) or
    stretching vertically, would possibly increase the similarity. That's the best
    I can suggest so far.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Stretching typeface is terrible in my book! Yes, indeed very similar but,
    the tip of the \"A\" is pointier. And, there is more contrast overall with their
    logo.\r\n\r\nSigh... but, thanks for looking into it!"
