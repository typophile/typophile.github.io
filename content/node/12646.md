  body: I can't find any proof, but for some reason I think the Canadian Gov'mnt commissioned
    its own font for the logo. I remember (way back when) thinking how cool it was
    that a government would think about graphical things.

    an exact match...\r\n\r\nMay be they employed a commission to change \"a's\"!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nJorge

  body: "Cool stuff Yves, and Jorg\xE9 you're right it's just a bit different - there's
    the 'a' and the ear on the 'n' in the logo is a bit rounder on the right. \r\n\r\nThanks
    Patty, I keep meaning to clean it up a bit - I was totally into ambigrams after
    reading Angels&Demons, for a few months. :)"
