  body: I think if LARRY COON'S from the bottom one is used with the top version,
    it'll be quite good.

    original? Also, not to get too technical, but is this logo for website masthead
    use only? I can't see how any of these would be applied effectively to other media.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick

  body: "For a sports logo, the vertically arched letters are a much better design
    than the radial/perspective letters. Always use vertically arched letters for
    sports. Always. \r\n\r\nIs there a less ridiculous place you could put Larry's
    name? I find it really irritating since I have no clue who he. And, unless he's
    the commissioner of NBA salaries, I don't care.\r\n"

    this is very much a rough draft)"

  body: "I think the basketball from the old logo adds a lot. The new logo, without
    it, looks a bit bland.\r\n\r\nI think Larry's name needs to be integrated better
    into the overall design. Right now it looks sprinkled on top, like an afterthought,
    and a bit detached from everything under it. \r\n\r\nI agree that the vertically
    stretched letters are much stronger. The horizontal stretching is gratuitous and
    looks kind of comical.\r\n\r\nI just went and looked at the website, wondering
    what the application of the graphic was. Given the utilitarian and plain formatting
    of the rest of the site, I think it actually works pretty well.\r\n\r\nIf it were
    me, I would put \"Larry Coon's\" inside of the \"plinth\", stretched across the
    entire width, with stars, and reintroduce the basketball behind, I might make
    it an orangy basketball color instead of grey just to add a bit of pop to it.\r\n\r\nNot
    a fan of your last try with the red ball. It's going to leave a huge amount of
    white space at the top of the page to no benefit."
