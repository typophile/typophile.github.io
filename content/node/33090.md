  you can have with Fontlab. I am really embarrassed to ask this question but I have
  searched everywhere on the program, internet, help books etc and it does not tell
  me anywhere. I need to know what the measurement system Fontlab uses on the side
  rulers in the glyphs window, ie millimeters, centimeters, points etc. Not knowing
  this makes it very difficult, especially when learning the program from scratch,
  to take all the drawing work I have done so far into the the program.\r\n\r\nThe
  hugest thank you to anyone who solves this for me, I will forever be in your debt!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nTom "

  body: I'd guess that there is not a set standard since you are building a scalable
    object. If it helps you should think of the ruler in Ems.

  body: "The rulers are in em units. An em unit is relative to the em size of the
    font. Typically, PostScript fonts (OpenType CFF or Type 1) have 1000 em units
    per Em. So, in this case, the Em units are 1/1000 of an em. TrueType fonts are
    usually 2048 units per em, so an em unit is 1/2048 of an em. Note that the em
    size of a font can be other values besides 1000 or 2048. These are just the most
    common ones.\r\n\r\nTo determine how an em unit relates to, say, points, you need
    to know what type size the font is set at and how many units are in the font's
    em size. Basically, the size of an em unit is the point size divided by the em
    size. Another way to think of it is that the em size is scaled to the type size
    being used. For example, if you set a PostScript font (with a 1000 unit em) at
    100 point, each em unit will be 1/10 of a point. So, in the real world, the em
    unit is always relative to the type size being used."

  body: "Hi Mark and Ken,\r\n\r\nThank you both very much for your words of wisdom!
    Really appreciated especially Mark for going into a bit more further detail in
    layman terms \u2014 again really appreciated thank you! \r\n\r\nI am sure in the
    coming months I will come across other obstacles where I may need to turn to a
    more experienced mind.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nTom"
