  body: "Lovely illustration on the top bar! I fact the top one-third of the page
    is really nice. Somehow the rest is not working as well as that.  \r\n\r\nProbably
    it is an issue of hierarchy. Quite a lot of elements seem to have more or less
    the same level of prominence that you are not sure what to look at first, what
    next. \r\n\r\nA few suggestions:\r\n\r\n:: Relook the text of your intro. While
    the different definitions of Sqawk are sort of fun, I wonder if it may not be
    an idea to combine those three levels of intro into one crisp, and if possible
    amusing :), paragraph of not more than three lines.\r\n \r\n:: You might want
    to introduce some white on the background in the lower half of the page. It's
    currently a little too monochromatic.\r\n\r\n:: Make the screen-shot of the featured
    project a little smaller. And avoid the project-title running into the thumbnail.
    \ \r\n\r\n:: The date on the description of the featured projects could perhaps
    come after the description itself, as against between project name and description.
    \r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n"

    to see if it makes a difference. What exactly do you mean by avoiding the project

    you're right. It's to do with the Opera browser. 'Doesn't seem to happen in IE"

  body: OK, thanks for the clarification... I've thought I tested every browser, but
    apparently I did forgot Opera... I'll have a look what I can do against that...
    css-wise...

    happens when users specify a minimum font-size. I know, there are not a lot of
    people who use that option, but I do \u2026\r\nF"

  body: "Florian: I did a little research on Safari's minimum font size. It seems
    like Safari forces it on the element after all other values have been computed.
    This means that widths (such as my left padding) are not updated. The only solution
    would be to stop using ems to specify widths, which I do not want to do... I do
    not know whether !important would make much of a difference.\r\nWhat's your opinion?
    I saw that did some webdesign, so I think it is safe to ask. (even though this
    is a typography forum.)\r\n\r\nEDIT: It seems like there is a way around it: http://www.gunlaug.no/contents/wd_1_03_04.html
    Just specify the largest font size on the parent and use values smaller than 1em
    on its children. Does anybody have any experience with this?\r\n\r\nThanks to
    everybody who pointed up some (obvious) flaws. However, I directed the post more
    at readability... Any comments on that? :("

  body: "<cite>What\u2019s your opinion? [\u2026] even though this is a typography
    forum.</cite>\r\n\r\nHey, there\u2019s more to typography than letterforms \u2013
    quite the contrary; positioning, size and interaction of text (and other) elements
    is what typography in a narrower sense is all about. ;\xB0)\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents
    (I hope you find them helpful and constructive):\r\n\r\nBuilding a scalable website
    is a honourable task \u2013 but it\u2019s full of pitfalls, too.  So, test-test-test,
    and don\u2019t assume every user will use the same UAs, fonts and font-sizes.\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    only solution would be to stop using ems to specify widths, which I do not want
    to do</cite>\r\nMaybe you have to compromise \u2026 Your background image is based
    on pixels, too \u2013 in consequence text runs across the bright vertical sidebar
    border.\r\n<strong>Create true correlations:</strong> If you want the sidebar
    to have a border, specify the border for this very element, not via the background-image
    for some superior element (\u2018div id=\"dock\"\u2019).\r\n\r\nI see you\u2019re
    fond of the web standards idea \u2013 which is laudable \u2013 however have in
    mind that it\u2019s not the validation engine that wants to be pleased but the
    human user.\r\n\r\nSome concrete points:\r\nSpecifying image size in em will preserve
    proportions, but it implicates uglily blurred images.\r\nYour list item contains
    a h4 heading, a paragraph (date) and another paragraph. If you want these 3 to
    align properly, treat them equally! If necessary, wrap them up in a container
    element. Right now, their aligning is more or less coincidental, depending on
    the user to retain the defaults (which defaults?).\r\n\r\n<cite>However, I directed
    the post more at readability... Any comments on that?</cite>\r\nWell, it\u2019s
    hard to descend to the details if elements overlap \u2026 ;\xB0) However: \r\nI
    find the line-height of h1 quite big.\r\nFor the \u2018Recent Weblog Entries\u2019
    section: Why can\u2019t the titles themselves be clickable? Is it really necessary
    to have a (to me) distracting extra \u2018Read\u2019 link in every single line?\r\n\r\nBest
    regards,\r\nF"
