body: "I would like to announce Hans Eduard Meier\u2019s 85th birthday on 30th December
  2007. He still is in very good shape and works on his PC (Windows) daily from 6
  till 11 am.\r\n\r\nThere are different birth dates of Hans in type history and also
  different spelling (Meyer) due to a mistake in the birth certificate (!). Anyway,
  the above infos are totally correct.\r\n\r\n[[Hans Eduard Meier]] designed [[Syntax]]
  Antiqua (hot metal type at Stempel foundry 1968\u201372), and for the Federal Technical
  Institute in Zurich Barbedor, Syndor, Oberon, Barbetwo. Meier designed for <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1443/hanseduardmeier.html\">Linotype</a>
  LT Syntax, Letter, and Lapidar. Elysa is a type for <a href=\"http://www.elsner-flake.de/\">E+F</a>,
  they also worked with Hans on a new \u2018Schulschrift\u2019 [School script] for
  primary schools in Switzerland (<a href=\"http://www.schulschrift.ch/\">www.Schulschrift.ch</a>).
  The fonts ABC are available at <a href=\"http://www.elsner-flake.de/\">E+F</a>.\r\nMeier
  wrote his standard work \u2018Development of Script and Type\u2019 (reprint by Syndor
  Press, now available at <a href=\"http://www.niggli.ch/\">Niggli</a>).\r\n\r\nHans
  has always been less known than other Swiss type designers. I\u2019m sure he will
  be pleased receiving some greetings from one or the other from this list.\r\nHis
  address is:\r\nH E M\r\nUnterkirchen\r\n8875 Obstalden\r\nSwitzerland\r\nhem[\xE4t]freesurf[dot]ch\r\n\r\nThankyou,
  and good wishes for a great New Year,\r\n\r\nErich Alb\r\nTypographer\r\nCham/Switzerland\r\n\r\n--\r\nHans

  body: "Syntax was the typeface I used the first time I got to design a publication
    on my own. Self taught as a designer I knew relatively little about typefaces
    then. Syntax just looked the most appropriate of available choices.\r\n\r\nToday,
    slightly better informed about typography, it feels really special to greet Hans
    Eduard Meier, the man who designed Syntax, on his birthday.  Many happy returns
    of the day sir!\r\n\r\nBtw, nearly a decade down that booklet continues to be
    in use, still doing its job rather well:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MIL1_3515.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MIL2_5571.jpg]"

  body: Hans Eduard Meier was walking ahead of me towards the venue for the Linotype
    Typotechnica in Heidelberg. I drew level with him as he paused at a red light,
    and together we observed the early morning road, devoid of any traffic whatsoever.
    I'd noticed in the preceding days that the Germans seemed very respectful of red
    lights, and never crossed the road against the light, so I thought I'd better
    wait for the light to change. Hans Eduard, the canny Swiss, turned to me and said
    'Come on, we're not children', and headed off across the street. For the rest
    of the walk to the venue, we had a lovely chat about type design and FontLab,
    which he was just beginning to use. He's a lovely man, and an admirable jaywalker.
