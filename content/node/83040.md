  your laptop, your skills and your guts. Hat optional (but it's a\r\ngreat symbolic
  touch - just sayin'). There's a local street performer of\r\n20 years giving me
  advice on etiquette and exactly where to settle in.\r\nWe're working on the portable
  chairs. Jackson Square is a quick hop\r\nfrom the conference site. It doesn't get
  better than this. Big or small,\r\nlet me know if you're in** and we'll do this
  thing.\r\n\r\n* http://www.typecon.com/archives/69\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/4911947563/\r\n\r\n**

  body: "To my surprise \"fun\" was exactly the most memorable thing from the LA event.
    People said the funniest things, including the cops! And N'awlins is much more
    \"laissez faire\" than even LA...\r\n\r\nI look forward to meeting Onur.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
