  body: "Leitura seems to get too strong in stroke contrast, it's getting displayed
    on screen so the fine sections kinda just disappear. What IS working are the lovely
    g, large x height and friendly tittle.\r\n\r\nthanks fontgrube - had actually
    forgotten about identifont similars. weird thing is, most of those suggested are
    actually sans...when I'm looking for serif.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul</strong>\r\n<a
