body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI've been working on a logo for a psychologist / certified
  mediation expert offering mediation and coaching related services on a freelance
  basis.\r\n\r\nThis is the one concept I did a couple months ago and still actually
  like. I will sketch out a couple other ideas as well, but would first like to get
  this to a point where I feel it is presentable as a rough (and I'm meeting her next
  Tuesday). Right now, I'm not quite sure it works.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/preview_tp_5556.png]\r\n\r\nSome
  notes \u2014\r\n\r\n1) That's her name, and that's her first name which is upside
  down. At the time being, I'me not aware of any sort of by-/sub-/tagline to go with
  it, although I'll probably suggest using one.\r\n\r\n2) I decided to try and focus
  on the wordmark instead of a 'pictorial' logo, mostly because all the ideas either
  she or I had for that felt either unfitting, too literal, or boring (paths merging
  and winding into the distance, across mountains etc.; hands joining together; talking
  heads)\r\n\r\n3) Ezzo feels like it matches her quite well; she's young and a very
  open and friendly person; she speaks German with a quirky and likeable accent, and
  is the kind of person who makes other people instantly comfortable with her \u2013
  down-to-earth would be a good word, and very professional at the same time. \r\n(Suggestions
  for other typefaces with this kind of 'feel' are very welcome.)\r\n\r\n4) As her
  name has a bunch of 'boring' letters, but <em>two g</em>s (yay!), I started playing
  with those, and with the idea of overlapping / linking their descenders (is that
  the bowl or the loop in English?), drawing on the idea of mediation being about
  bringing different sides together & acknowledging different perspectives on the
  same thing. \r\nI tried to align them so that they don't clog at small sizes, and
  I seem to 'see' a hairline connecting them smoothly which isn't there, but maybe
  that's just my brain on too much orange juice trying to fend off the flu.\r\n\r\nSo,
  I don't know. Is it too literal? Too minimal? Boring? Too little, too much? Does
  it work to put her first name upside down like that? I think I've stared at it too
  long. And I'm thankful for any comments. "

  body: "FWIW - the Gs are paired very nicely, their combination looks very fluid
    and natural. \r\n\r\nHowever the \"Inge\" part is quite hard to read. This is
    primarily because the \"ge\" part looks like a reflection of its upper counterpart,
    and so it implies a form of symmetry in the mark. But the \"In\" part breaks the
    symmetry and the eye just keeps wandering around trying to find it .. so it takes
    an effort to stop doing that and to actually focus on reading the name.\r\n\r\nHow
    about playing off the symmetry instead ? Basically flip \"egm\" vertically, place
    it exactly below the original, mirror each letter and then split \"m\" into \"I\"
    and \"n\". Something like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wegmann_4078.png]"

    I was afraid it'd just look like it was horridly kerned. ;)  But it actually looks
    quite interesting. Must give this some thought :)"

    seems completely strange that part of the name is upside down\u2014especially
    considering this is a very professional field.\r\n\r\ni think you should try a
    different concept"

  body: "As is, it bothers me that it reads \"Wegmann...Inge,\" when the name you
    want to convey is \"Inge Wegmann.\" A potential change that might help this: did
    you consider having the words go vertically, so Inge would run upwards on the
    left and Wegmann downwards on the right? That would make the order better - I
    also think side-to-side \"confrontation\" might say \"mediation\" better than
    the dominator-dominated arrangement you have. So semantically it might work, I'd
    think, but visually you'd have to try it and see.\r\nHope that helps."

  body: "Thanks for the feed-back guys.\r\n\r\nCraig, I tried doing the vertical thing;
    not sure if this helps it? I feel it's \"heading down\" very strongly now. It
    does now feel like two more equal parts, although the vertical direction scares
    me a bit (it loses a bit of the \"stability\" and her being \"down to earth\",
    no?).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/preview_tp_2_5793.png]\r\n\r\nI
    must say I'm not really happy with having her first name upside down, although
    I'd hope one would read it as a mirroring of some sort, so maybe Alex's idea with
    reinforcing the symmetry could be a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nFWIW,
    I just did the 'normal person test' with somebody who had no idea what this is
    about, and she immediately took to it plus guessed quite correctly what it was
    for / about, which is reassuring (but of course doesn't mean it doesn't need some
    tweaking still). \r\n\r\nSo thanks again! Keep it coming :)"

  body: "Just wanted to get back with a quick snap of what we just got back from the
    printers.\r\nWe (okay: I) have decided to usually set the logo horizontally, but
    alternately, vertically if the format calls for it (like on the flyer). I think
    both variants work well. Most importantly though, I haven't often had such an
    incredibly overjoyed client, so that's good. :-)\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ingewegmann_finished_5246.jpg]"

    because text tends to be here and there without any specific order. Some of it
    is right aligned, logo is somewhat centred and bottom part is then right aligned...\r\n\r\nApart
    from this I really like colour scheme...\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
