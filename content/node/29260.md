  body: 'Can''t agree with timd: Joanna''s italic is an absurdly mismatched disaster,
    and Swift is too spiky and aggressive. Try Celeste, which has just the right delicacy,
    character shape, and x-height to match Gill Sans pretty well. Also, Josh Darden''s
    Corundum. This is actually one of the harder match-up questions I''ve seen here. '

  body: I matched Gill with Perpetua in a marketing magazine for a bank, and they
    worked very nicely together for many years. It's a bit of an obvious pairing,
    but there are some interesting family members in both faces, such as Perpetua
    Titling, Gill Extra Bold and the Condensed Gills. And Gill Shadow. I had to make
    a beefed-up Perpetua for footnotes. In all, the typographic palette was quite
    large, although the Gill figure "1" is really nasty.

    body: "I'd have to agree with Nick.\r\n\r\nTraditionally Gill is paired with Perpetua.\r\n\r\nIf
      it were me, and Perpetua just wasn't working I'd have to go through a standard
      matching process (x, cap, ascender, descender, width, weight, italic if necessary).
      I'd still recommend Perptua though. Afterall, it's not the font, but how it
      is used that is important. A skilled typographer should be able to set a wedding
      invitation in Helvetica."

  body: "Pardon me while I belabour the point, as we pedants are wont. Being somewhat
    of a regular here, I can't help but notice that certain themes and questions frequently
    appear, d\xE9j\xE0 vu all over again.~  Hardly a day goes by without someone who
    has a particular typeface in mind inquiring as to what other face might go well
    with it, make a good companion, be the sans to its serif or vice versa --in short,
    as it's usually put, what would \"compliment\" the face in question.\r\n\r\nMight
    I suggest that as the word \"compliment\" is rarely used at Typophile in its correct
    meaning, and that as the said word is invariably proffered instead of the correct
    \"complement\", that SmartyPants be instructed to substitute \"compliment\" by\"
    complement\" on these here web pages?\r\n\r\nAfter all, ol' Smarty has a mind
    to replace hash marks (primes) by \"proper\" quotes, even though he frequently
    cocks it up -- I refer of course to abbreviations where a hash mark is turned
    into a left quote, when an apostrophe would be correct.\r\n\r\nSo if, at the expense
    of blowing off the occasional abbreviation, \"smart\" quotes are deemed acceptable,
    surely by the same principle of digitally-enabled bowdlerization it would be desirable
    to improve the spelling to which one is exposed at Typophile, by the same means."

    to correctly type the solution to a homophonic dilemma; it's not like simply using
    a dictionary to determine the correct spelling of a word, one also has to understand
    what two different words mean, before choosing the right one.\r\n\r\nSmartyPants
    replaces something that is vaguely incorrect most of the time (\"dumb\" quotes)
    with something that is patently wrong some of the time (backwards apostrophes).\r\n\r\nHere's
    another one for Smarty: the lower case \"i\" flanked by spaces is always wrong,
    therefore it should be capitalized. But what if someone prefers their personal
    pronoun to be timid and friendly? And what if someone prefers their quote marks
    dumb?  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAnother choice of face would be Scala, on the principal
    that Scala Sans is somewhat of a humanist peer to Gill Sans."

    what about passages in the many languages (including most Scandinavian and those
    Slavic languages written in the Latin alphabet) where 'i' is a fairly common (uncapitalized)
    word? Take these lines from the Lord's Prayer in a few of these languages.\r\n\r\nCroatian:
    \"... kako na Nebu, tako i na Zemlji\"\r\nSwedish: \"Fader V\xE5r som \xE4r i
    Himmelen\"\r\nWelsh: \"Dyro i ni heddiw ein bara beunyddiol\"\r\n\r\nI point this
    out because Microsoft Word always automatically capitalizes the 'i' when I try
    to type Swedish. It's the most annoying thing ever. In fact, I am against most
    attempts at autocorrection in word processors and such, smart quotes being the
    only major exception."

  body: "I saw Goudy used with Gill Sans on a Junior Scrabble board game box a few
    months ago.\r\n\r\nThe headings were set in Gill Sans and the body was set in
    Goudy. It looked like a nice combination together. The g and the a are similar
    in letter form too.\r\n\r\nMany of the headings were in Gill Sans all caps and
    the body text was set in Goudy.\r\n\r\nSome of the subheadings were set in Gill
    Sans upper and lower case right into the Goudy body copy (on the same line).\r\n\r\nSome
    other minor subheads were set in Goudy bold.\r\n\r\nThere was some less important
    info to the side of the layout all set in a box in Gill Sans: Gill Sans bold u&lc
    for heading and Gill Sans regulars for the paragraph text.\r\n\r\nThis combination
    of Gill with Goudy provided a nice variety of text weight colour to the layout.\r\n\r\nI
    think Goudy works well with Gill Sans."
