  title=\"CSS3 Fonts Module\">CSS3 Fonts Module</a> provides a syntax to use CSS to
  declare use of a few dozen OpenType properties. If I have the list correct, they

  This is merely a proposal. CSS3 has been broken into modules so that that makers
  of browsers (etc.) can pick and choose which modules to support rather than being
  offered a package deal of every single CSS feature, which, experience proves, is
  too much to handle at once. (Hence it is impossible to state that a browser \u201Csupports
  CSS3.\u201D)\r\n\r\nNonetheless, this is surely a useful development. The <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/#acknowledgments\"
  title=\"Acknowledgements\">acknowledgements</a> on the page will reveal a few Usual
  Suspects."

    in CSS. Could you point to or provide a few code snippets demonstrating the use
    of these properties? "

  body: "It's worth noting that the typography properties themselves are at a higher
    level than the OTL features, i.e. the latter represent one possible way of implementing
    a CSS3 typography property; the same property could also be implemented with equivalent
    e.g. AAT or Graphite features.\r\n\r\nI note that there doesn't seem to be support
    for caps as smallcaps (OTL=c2sc), which is a problem. This is probably a distinction
    that needs to be made at the caps-value level. [The same is true for caps as petite-caps,
    of course.]"

  body: "Yes, the CSS properties merely correspond to OpenType. They could correspond
    to other implementations. In practice, will they, though?\r\n\r\nNow, since I\u2019m
    one of those people who does <em>not</em> sit down to read the OpenType specification
    over coffee, which is odd because I have done exactly that with many other specifications,
    do please explain, John, if <code>c2sc</code> means \u201Cevery single letter
    becomes small caps, whether originally capitalized or not.\u201D"

    know how they have 100, 200, 300, ..., 900\r\n\r\nThen again I'm not sure what
    the fonts have to do, to be able to do that. Would be interesting to find out."

  body: Joe, c2sc converts uppercase letters (and potentially lining figures and some
    punctuation) to smallcaps, and smcp converts lowercase letters to smallcaps. Practically,
    c2sc isn't expected to be applied independently of smcp, so I would expect the
    CSS3 caps-value to have options similar to InDesign's smallcaps (smcp) and all-to-smallcaps
    (c2sc+smcp) distinction.
