  versions of classic text typefaces absolutely pale in comparison to their original
  counterparts. In my opinion, the foremost examples of this include Electra and Fairfield.
  <BR> <BR>I remember once getting lucky and stumbling upon an original, non-digitized
  setting of Gill&#39;s Perpetua somewhere &#40;which almost looked like an entirely
  different typeface and made me wonder how Monotype ended up with the revival it
  did&#41;. Sadly, I don&#39;t quite remember which book it was. <BR> <BR>My question
  is this: are there any samples &#40;photocopies, et c.&#41; of an original setting
  of Perpetua floating around on the internet?'

    target="_blank">Sigurd Lewerenz</a> was published.  <BR>Actually, it was a real
    piece of work. <BR>The project had started several years ago, but had got shelved.
    But then all of a sudden, back on track.  <BR> <BR>From a typophilian view it
    was something as rare as a photo type setting of  Perpetua &#40;in context of
    today&#39;s technology, at least&#41;, and despite what has been said of that
    technique, it sure looks <i>so</i> much better than the digital one.  <BR> <BR>

  body: Brandon <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve printed books with the metal Perpetua and it is
    quite a beautiful face that is well suited to it purpose. The digital version
    is not nearly quite on. I think the problem was that it was a bit of an early
    issue before some of the concerns than many of us now share were realized.  <BR>
    <BR>With the Monotype Pastonchi however &#40;which I believe may have been Monotype
    Typography&#39;s last effort before they merged with Agfa&#41;, they were right
    on. The digital is quite near an exact match to the metal version. <BR> <BR>I
    suspect the early concerns in regard to historical revivals was not quite what
    they are today.  <BR> <BR>Gerald Lange <BR>The Bieler Press
