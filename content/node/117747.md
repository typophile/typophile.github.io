body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI\u2019m trying to figure out what some typefaces are related to
  two different images from the inside of Playbills: \r\n\r\nIn the first attachment,
  I\u2019d like to know what typefaces are used for \u201CPRESENT\u201D and \u201CAUDRA
  MCDONALD\u201D or \u201CBY\u201D and \u201CLANIE ROBERTSON.\u201D \u201CPRESENT\u201D
  and \u201CBY\u201D look a a little like Sweet Sans, but don\u2019t think that\u2019s
  it. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s used for \u201CAUDRA MCDONALD\u201D or \u201CLANIE
  ROBERTSON.\u201D \r\n\r\nIn the second attachment, it would be great to know what
  typeface is used for \u201CACT II,\u201D as well as the info below it related to
  the the Scenes, Scene Names, Characters, etc. They all look to be the same typeface
  (bold and roman being the only difference) and I think are standard across most
  Playbills but don\u2019t know what they are. \r\n\r\nAny assistance would be greatly
  appreciated. "

  body: "PRESENT and BY appear to be some form of Bank Gothic (though very hard to
    tell given the tiny size of the sample; when scanning, focus only on the type
    you need identified and scan as large as possible):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bank-gothic/\r\n\r\nMy
    best guess for AUDRA and LANIE is Trade Gothic Condensed:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/\r\n\r\nThe
    text time is garden variety Times (without a larger size sample, hard to determine
    whether it's Times, Times New Roman, etc.):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/apple/times/\r\n\r\n"

      PRESENT and BY are not Bank Gothic, but appreciate the attempt. '
