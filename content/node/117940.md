  body: "Sans text is pretty small, but in view of the probability that the serif
    is Times New Roman Cyrillic, I suspect that the sans is its common web companion
    Arial Cyrillic. Check the lower case [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArialCyrLC_6562.jpg]
    against the lower case letters in the sample.\r\nAs an earmark, note the distinctive
    shape of the leg on \u044F.\r\nDon"
