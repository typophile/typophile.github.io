		<div class="commentbody">Nope. First, the ideas that students think are great are often things that people with the technical skills have had, and realized are flawed.

Secondly, if you could make money with ideas (and not the execution of them) I would be a rich man.

Learn the technical skills, and then the ideas can be realized, and you will discover the many that don't work, and can start to build your reputation with the few that do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You’re confusing execution with production, and you’re also not learning to work within your limits. Most designers don’t do their own illustration, or photography, or molding of plastic packages; they pay productions specialists to do it. For school projects, don’t try to do that stuff—do other stuff instead. When I want great photos, I scan them or use stock, when I have to design a package I reuse existing components. But I don’t worry about ideas that I can’t produce—I just think of something else instead.</div>

Not at all. A graphic designer’s job is to communicate by bringing various sensory elements together in a way that works technically and aesthetically. Nobody expects a designer to do her own photography—after all, just getting good at one area of photography can take years, much less being able to photograph everything from still life to portrait to urban architecture. If I wanted to do really great outdoor photography in downtown DC the camera alone would cost me tens of thousands of dollars and I wouldn’t even know how to use it—so using other people’s work is the only option!

There are plenty of photographers who understand this and post their work on sites like Flickr and sxc.hu just for student (and low-budget) designers to use. And in most countries there are “fair use” exceptions in copyright law that allow students to use other works for non-commercial purposes.

In the commercial world, all these specialists are pretty well compensated for their work. They also often get credit (ever notice the name of the photographer alongside an image) or get paid extra to leave their name off the work. So it’s really a win-win situation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">first of all,  learn never to make excuses for your work.  that right there is a separation between those who can  and those who think they can't. guess which one will get hired ?

second : as a student you can employ all sorts of tricks and appropriation that will not be acceptable as a professional. it's understood that students needto experiment with ideas on limited budgets. when showing these works in an interview it can actually speak very well to your integrity if outside sources are properly credited.

third : most creative directors and "idea people" have risen in the ranks thru positions where they learned the skills that they now direct.

fourth : be resourceful ! make a mock-up or a multi-view illustration if you can't produce the actual object.

fifth : investigate the skill sets of your fellow students and consider collaborating or trading services. taking advantage of available resources is another attribute that will recognized in an interview. try to get into a "can do" mindset. make things happen.

Ch: I know who will get hired and where there's a will, there's a way attitude is a must but maybe my tutors expect me to be an all rounder which I'm not. She said I have to take the photography shots and I have spent ages in the studio doing them but they are not as good as photographers make them out to be of course. I guess in industry, you have a photographer doing it so its much easier.</div>

He or she is just trying to encourage you to try many different things so that you have an appreciation of what goes into design. A broad set of skills is useful, and so is resourcefulness. The more work you do as a student in different areas of design will eventually give you a better idea of what you want to specialize in.

		<div class="commentbody">I read this thread with interest ... misgiggles when you are an art director you will never be required to take a photograph. That's what photographers and illustrators are for. You have an idea, then you commission a photographer whose style is in tune with what you are looking for in your design. You brief the photographer clearly, most often direct the shoot and he or she produces an image that is partly yours. So you are not appropriating someone else's work as the photographer is having to execute your idea. 
This is one of the skills you should be learning at college, and one which you will be constantly improving through your industry experience. </div>
