body: 'Searching for methods to understand easily the process of typeface production
  for a good thesis, i found some stuff but i want to call to typophiles to your personal
  &#34;Mystique&#34; for creating good work from the beginning to the end. <BR> <BR>I
  mean you can have a good idea for a typeface design, but without a process... or
  thinking about contribute...with a thousand mediocre free fonts around here will
  be good to know the importance of the process behind a good typeface. <BR> <BR>I
  found a good Factory Tour of the House Industries in the Idea magazine from Japan
  on is number 281, page 73.  <BR> <BR>They are seven steps <BR>&#62; Concept Development
  <BR>&#62; Research <BR>&#62; Planning <BR>&#62; Layout <BR>&#62; Work Development
  <BR>&#62; Copyright <BR>&#62; Final Production <BR> <BR>What do you think about
  this? <BR> <BR>MH. <BR> <BR> <BR> '

  body: I think Mystique and Method are opposed. Formality impedes instinct. Just
    drawing your font takes care of all that &#34;concept development&#34; and &#34;research&#34;
    stuff &#40;assuming you&#39;re not just reviving/remixing something that already
    exists&#41;. On the other hand, doing research into things like readability is
    useful as a foundation - that any many other things &#40;like exposure to the
    work of others over time&#41; implicitly guide your drawing anyway. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I&#39;m perhaps crazy, but I dont use that at all. I just open FontLab when
    I have five minutes between to others type jobs, or when watching TV on a good
    chair... and draw some new glyphs for a current typeface in dev. <BR> <BR>Then,
    couple months later, a new family is done. <BR> <BR> <BR>If I think a bit more,
    all the process you describe happen in some way, but in quite destructured way,
    during my dreams for example. <BR> <BR>Anyway I need to stop now, I&#39;m busy
    right now, I have a meeting with my dreams in couple of minutes, bonne nuit...

  body: Miguel, I would suppose a lot of that has to do with  <BR>whether the face
    is being commissioned &#40;as so many good  <BR>ones are&#41; or whether it&#39;s
    going to become a pet project of a  <BR>&#34;serious hobbyist&#34; &#40;as so
    many good ones are&#41;. <BR> <BR>Since your purpose is academic, I&#39;d think
    you would benefit  <BR>from focusing on the commissioned side, where a client  <BR>would
    hand the designer/foundry a list of requirements  <BR>and/or desired attributes
    and/or research. <BR> <BR>[Dang, those are two very fine run-ons. Look out Jon.]

  body: I agree with jfp. Eventually, new typefaces just sort of &#34;happen.&#34;
    Of course whatever method works for the designer is the right method.

  body: Miguel <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>In idle moments I more or less &#34;write&#34; letters
    with a soft &#40;4B&#41; flat sketch pencil. This is a habit of a lot of years
    of comping layouts in pencil. In the early days, a person developed a representative
    sans and a roman etc. that could be used in a layout, and substitiuted for almost
    any typeface that was decided on in the production process. <BR> <BR>I save all
    the doodles, and go through them from time to time to find out what I think will
    work as a type. <BR> <BR>The scale I work at mostly is about a 3/4 to 1 inch x-  height.
    Once I have cut in with a fine point to delineate the forms. <BR> <BR>People work
    in many different ways. Whatever it takes to get there is good if it works for
    you. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

    &#39;how can I explain people, why we need new typefaces&#39;, typefaces can be
    like cars. There are cars for every purpose you can think of and still, they always
    can be designed better. <BR> <BR>You should try to think of a purpose/task, which
    your typeface should fullfill. Then you&#39;ll probably have enough to research
    about. <BR> <BR>For example: '
