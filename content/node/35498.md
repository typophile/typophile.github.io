  this will be a quickier one, though. :-) Think I got my matches to these ones; would
  really just like a double-check/confirmation: <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/garamond-3/>Garamond
  3</a>, for the italic, and <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stempel-garamond/>Stempel
  Garamond</a>, for the regular, would that be correct?... Or?... (Again, the original
  sample has other letters (no caps, though); should it be required to aid IDing,
  please let me know, and I'll provide a sample of those.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/es2002_5543.JPG]\r\n\r\nThank
  you, once more, for all help. :-)\r\n"

    programmering is a bastard font.

  body: "Thank you for confirming. :-)\r\n\r\nYes, I too wondered why both Garamonds
    were mixed, thus why I thought I'd ask for confirmation (as I wondered whether
    there might eventually be some another particular Garamond which actually would
    alone match the sample, both for the italic and the upright characters)...\r\n\r\nJust
    wondering now, though, the fact that you mentioned the \"aka's\" for those Garamonds,
    would it be because that is indeed as they are most usually referred to, yes?
    Yes, I know both names, for each of those Garamonds respectively, both names refer
    to the same font, only from different foundries, yes, I know. But so, is it more
    usual to call them, respectively, American Garamond than Garamond 3, and Original
    Garamond than Stempel, would that be it? (Again, pardon my ignorance... :-P)"
