  body: "Look for a face with short descenders.\r\nIt's also important to have tabular
    figures that are the same width in different weights.\r\nSome would say a foot
    serif on the figure one is necessary.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude/\">Amplitude</a>
    is a good agate face.\r\nNot only does it have the right proportions, but its
    ink traps keep the image sharp.\r\n\r\nI would be remiss not to mention my own
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sense/\">Sense</a>, which is presently
    used for the stock tables in <em>The Globe and Mail</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
