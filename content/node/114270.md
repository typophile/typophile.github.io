  \ and am making decent headway, except I've run into a problem with GSUB ligature
  substitution...\r\n\r\nIf you load [[http://pomax.github.io/CFF-glyphlet-fonts]]
  in Firefox, you'll note that the \"small\" font, without GSUB table, renders the
  character \"~\" as a rectangle with a cutout. The second font has a GSUB table for
  the 'liga' feature with a lookup type 4 to turn the sequence \"c,u,s,t,o,m\" into
  \"~\", [[http://github.com/Pomax/CFF-glyphlet-fonts/blob/gh-pages/binaries/with%20GSUB/customfont.gsub.ttx#L271]],
  which works in Firefox, but not in Chrome or IE (of course IE doesn't like plain
  .otf, so the fonts are repackaged as uncompressed WOFF as well, as fallback option).\r\n\r\nI
  tried running the larger font through TTX, as well as tried loading it in FontForge,
  to see if those found any obvious errors, but neither seem to complain about the
  shape and content of the GSUB table, so I'm not sure if I've done something wrong
  definition wise, or whether there are specific values that a font with GSUB ligatures
  needs to set before it'll work in Chrome/IE. I know [[http://symbolset.com|Symbolset]]
  works in all three browsers, and relies on GSUB tables for the icon ligatures, so
  I tried to see whether they did something different from what I implemented, but
  I couldn't really find anything (the TTX xml for symbolset is also quite huge!)\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone here have experience with cff-opentype fonts for webfont purposes, with GSUB
  liga features, and might they be willing to have a quick look at what I might be
  doing wrong?\r\n\r\n- Mike \"Pomax\" Kamermans"

    and with the ReqFeatureIndex value set to zero, to indicate the feature at offset
    index 0 must always be turned on.\r\n\r\nChrome and IE, unfortunately, don't understand
    this at all, and need to also see a \"latn\" script (or whichever block covers
    your ligature source glyphs) in order to be able to apply any feature. And then
    they must also be told to enable the \"liga\" opentype feature specifically, through
    CSS, despite the ReqFeatureIndex value in the default LangSys table indicating
    that this feature should always be turned on.\r\n\r\nI've implemented these workarounds,
    and http://pomax.github.io/CFF-glyphlet-fonts should now show the custom glyph
    in the \"with GSUB\" section in all major OS/browser combinations."
