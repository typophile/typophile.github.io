body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nSoftonium Developments is proud to announce Find my Font v3.0 which
  is a major update to our font matching tool.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.findmyfont.com/images/stories/fmf/screenshots/FMF-Win-Connected-Letters.png|<img

  for bigger image]]\r\n\r\n<strong>a. Major new feature: Both Local and Online matching
  supported</strong>\r\nThe most important feature introduced is the capability to
  find a font from an image not only by scanning the local fonts of your PC but to
  retrieve also font matches from an Online Font-Matching Database.\r\n\r\n<strong>b.
  The Online Font Matching database</strong>\r\nOur database currently contains matching
  information about 40.000+ Commercial, Freeware, Shareware and Free fonts, including
  major commercial foundries/vendors and fonts from Shareware/Free resources like
  Dafont.com & Google Web Fonts.\r\nYou can have a look at how an Online-Font-Preview
  looks like, here: <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Linotype&ffam=BauerBodoni%20RomanOsF%20-%20Bold&fid=2c87990d71dc9b8166c753c728dc7bc6&fsize=60&text=Find%20my%20Font%20Bodoni%20Sample&wrap=2|Bauer
  Bodoni Preview Sample]]</strong>\r\n\r\nWe update our database very carefully, to
  avoid including any clones or forgeries of copyrighted fonts. If you spot such a
  case, please send us a message through the integrated font-feedback form and we
  will investigate the case and remove the associated font as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<strong>c.
  How to include your fonts in our database</strong>\r\nIf you are a font designer
  or represent a foundry and you are interested to include your fonts in our matching
  database along with direct links to your site and links to major font resellers
  like MyFonts.com or FontShop.com, please contact us. There are no hidden charges
  or strings attached to our offer, this is a win-win situation: We are making our
  database more complete and you can sell more fonts by increasing your exposure.\r\n\r\n<strong>d.
  How to acquire the new release</strong>\r\nThe new version 3.0 is offered as a free
  upgrade to all our current customers and the online matching feature is also available
  to our Free-30-Days-Trial demo. You can read more details or download our 30-Days-Trial
  in the <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/find-my-font/editions|Find

  helped us a lot to make Find my Font a better tool. <strong>I will be really glad

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nwe have just deployed a new Find my Font version: 3.1.00.\r\nYou
    can find bellow the full  list of new features, the most important being the addition
    of an image correction tool, which allows the user to identify a font without
    any external image pre-processing even in cases of perspective deformation (e.g.
    a photo taken from a weird angle) or a low quality image.\r\n\r\nThe new tool
    performs one or all of the following operations in a single step:\r\nCorrect Deformation
    & Perspective,  Enlarge Image x3, Mirror Image, Increase Contrast & Shrink or
    Expand Image Horizontally.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FmF_ImageCorrectionScreen_3442.jpg]\r\nThis
    is a sample screen to show how the image correction tool works: You select a 4-points
    area -by following the text-flow-, select all required options (in this case Enlarge
    & Perspective Fix) and click on the [Apply] button to acquire a corrected image
    copy, on top of your original image. \r\nThe next step is to proceed with letter
    selection & font identification - as usual.\r\n\r\nI 'd like to thank all Typophile
    site font-masters for the valuable expertise I gained by your feedback and I also
    like to thank all of you asked for or solved a font ID request, because the only
    way to improve an application is to adapt it to real-world samples and real people
    needs.\r\n\r\nYou can download the latest release by entering your license number
    in the product update page:\r\nhttp://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/members/product-update\r\n\r\nor
    you can always download the free-30-days-trial edition here:\r\nhttp://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/download/download-free-edition\r\n\r\nI
    will be glad to hear your thoughts about this new release.\r\nCheers,\r\nFivos\r\n\r\n===========================================\r\n<strong>Full
    list of Find my Font v3.1.00 new features:</strong>\r\n===========================================\r\n<strong>(1)

    \   Image mirroring\r\n    Contrast correction\r\n    Image expansion\r\nAll the
    above corrections can be performed on the whole image of any part of it. A preview
    is shown to allow the user to perform the necessary adjustments before finalizing
    the correction.\r\n\r\n<strong>(2) Network Parameters</strong> \r\nThe program
    now allows the user to indicate if he's using a proxy to connect to the internet
    and the parameters for the connection.\r\n\r\n<strong>(3) Improved Baseline Rotation

    operation much easier.\r\n\r\n<strong>(4) Tool tips  </strong>\r\nThe new tool
