<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello everyone… I know that the "what printer should I buy for typeface proofing" question has been done to death over and over on Typophile, so I will try to keep my question really specific.
I'm about to buy a laser printer in Berlin. I've narrowed my search down to two possibilities: the HP LaserJet 1022 and the HP LaserJet P2015.
In England, I've inherited an 1022, but I don't have it with me when I am in Germany, and I will be leaving it in Reading (hello Reading MATD class of 2008–2009!) when I relocate back to Germany for good at the end of September. The 1022 is nice, but it doesn't render outlines 100% perfectly. It is close though.
So I need to buy a printer for the longer haul. I can easily afford another 1022, but the twice-as-expensive P2015 (300 euro vs. 130 euro) looks good as well. I don't care about printing speed, since I only proof a few pages at a time. Both printers print 1200 x 1200 dpi. But if I can get better (really) outline rendition on 12 point type, the price increase of the P2015 would be worth it, I think.
Does anyone here use the P2015? Would you recommend it? Thanks!
P.S.: At Linotype, I used a P3005, which I just love, love, love! If I can find one in my price range, I'd probably buy it instead. But this isn't really my question.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I use the P2015 and it's great and only eight seconds from you print to the first page comes out – even from standby mode. Highly recommended.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dan,
have you thought about getting an older model? I bought a used LJ 4050 last summer for about 70 € (incl. PS, 3rd paper cassette, no network). That's a real workhorse, indestructible ;)
I can compare only to a HP LJ 6MP (600dpi) and a 1200dpi Kyocera FS-1920, the 4050 prints way better than both of them.
If you're in Berlin, I can show you a printout :)

<div class=commentbody>As the previous owner of your 1022... I'm surprised you would consider buying another (but happy it's worked for you, too). The price is certainly right, but its print outs are grainy and always heavy. I wouldn't buy that printer for the long-haul.
How is the 1022, anyway? Does it miss me?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dan,
I have a 2300 HP. It is 600dpi and comes with what they call Pro Rez that is supposed to simulate 1200 dpi. I would compare results to how an inflatable woman compares to a real human :-)
It is a good general purpose machine but not so good for type design. As you say with the 1022, outline rendition at smaller sizes is not acceptable for type design use. Let me now how your new machine works out!

<div class=commentbody>><em>How is the 1022, anyway? Does it miss me?</em>
Yes, it does! I think that it misses Charlie most of all, though. The printer is decidedly not moody, which I can't say about any of the other printers I try to connect to regularly. Of course you are right about that weight being a problem.
Jens, I have thought about buying a used printer. The only drawback is that I need to make my decision soon; I'd like to have whatever I'm going to get by this time next week.
It is nice to hear some good things about the P2015.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have a P2015 too. The main drawback already - noted else where - is that hinted fonts don't proof properly with it. It's some kind of HP rendering engine glitch. I have been meaning to see if they patched it in some kind of firmware update or something for a while! But if you can proof sans hints then you are alright. I really like it's speed and the quality is good. I compared it against many other new printers looking at actual output last year and I felt it was the best compromise in the price range. Paper has a definite impact on quality. I have had no issues with it in the past year.</div>

<div class=commentbody>HP uses postscript emulation, rather than true postscript. For true postscript I recomment the Ricoh that James mentioned above, or a Xante machine. I have the Ricoh and think it's a great machine. They also make a smaller version, I can't remember the exact name.</div>

<div class=commentbody>No problem with unhinted fonts.
HP's PS-interpreter applies hints even at resolutions/sizes that don't need hints. E.g. overshoot is suppressed, so round letters are smaller than they actually are. Not really useful for evaluating type design.
It's amazing that HP <em>still</em> hasn't done anything about it -- they know about the problem for a couple of years now.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I knew about HP's PostScript clone incorrectly applying overshoot suppression at sizes beyond what it should. Do we actually know anything specific about any other bad hint processing on their part? I certainly don't.
Although the overshoot processing bug *is* a big one for type designers working with Type 1 or OpenType CFF, it bothers me when a very specific problem starts to be represented as being broader and more nebulous than it is. Then again, maybe Karsten knows something I don't - certainly possible!

<div class=commentbody>Yep, the "e.g." before "overshoot" was nonsense. The overshoot issue is serious enough for type designers who want to <em>see</em> the overshoot and evaluate whether it is sufficient or not. What bothers me is that type designers who use a HP (one without original Adobe RIP) should need to find out by themselves that the error is <em>not</em> in their drawings.
Btw, I still use a HP printer, my third or fourth, because I like the printing quality.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, thank you everyone for all your comments! After much looking, I've ordered the P2015. If it is good enough for Peter Bruhn, then it is good enough for me, I guess.
I spent a while looking for Ricohs, Xantes and Xeroxes. None of these were carried in stores. I had heard some good things about real PostScript Xeroxes, but online, I could only find a single b/w Xerox Phaser in my price range, and just had PostScript 3 emulation. I could get a big Ricoh, but only if I had it shipped from the US. That would surely take too long, and I'd have to pay import duties as well, which in my experience seem to average about 20% of the cost. I couldn't find any Xantes in country either.
Since I'm proofing unhinted type, I think that I'll be allright for now. I've had good experiences with the HP 3005, so I have my fingers crossed. Wish me luck!
Chris, I can send you samples later if you'd like.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant,
According to the HP site, Print languages are HP PCL 5e HP PCL 6, HP postscript level 3 emulation.
HP has a reasonable postscript emulation but tends to add more weight to horizontal than to vertical lines. It is also a tad bit heavier than true PostScript. It is very reliable though.

Interesting. Is this documented anywhere,
or did you do hi-res scans or something?
> It is also a tad bit heavier than true PostScript.
Well, the lower a printer's resolution (yours is 600 dpi, right?)
the thicker everything looks. Or do you mean that at the same
resolution a true PS printer renders lighter?
BTW, my 1022 has a weight setting that makes everything
lighter or heavier, but I haven't tested it rigorously.

I meant heavier than a 1200 dpi Xante with true Adobe PostScript, not my 600 dpi printer. I have done ImageSetter tests using a Linotronic at 2540 dpi. The Linotronic was clearly lighter than any Laser printer I have ever seen and the curves and near verticals (as you might imagine) were incredibly smoothe. I can't even find a service bureau which does this kind of output any more. Direct to plate prepress has killed the market, The only people on the planet who want Linotronic photo paper output are type designers like us and we are all too broke and too few to be worth the effort. :-)
I find the lightweight settings on laser printers just reduces the density of toner applied giving you the appearance of lighter weight but not really accurate enough to help you refine a typeface at text sizes or smaller.

That's mostly (but not entirely) due to the higher resolution though.

That's something called "economode" or something, that saves toner by printing gray. AFAIK there's something else that causes more or less toner to amass on the drum, in effect making the "silhouettes" fatter or thinner. But yeah, I wouldn't trust that to equate to a higher-res printer at all, at least not at the letterform level.

That actually does look like a great unit.
Replaced my Laserjet P2015 (it died, out of warranty) with this:
http://www.brother.ca/en/printer/description.asp?Prodid=7407656982107861709&features=on

It's getting excellent reviews. It does true 1200 dpi, duplexing, emulates Postscript 3 (supposed to be decent), and is quite affordable.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Brother is generally supposed to be pretty good from what I hear. FWIW one guy from my type class did a little comparison about half a year ago comparing scans from the same file printed on different printers; the Brother models (HL5040 and HL5250) performed exceptionally in terms of quality, compared to the rest (some HP/Canon/Lexmark models). Now these models don't seem to be available anymore… but maybe that's a vote for Brother in general.</div>

Nina,
The comparison of scanned images is not the best way to check a printer for use in type design. You can see general printing ability and rendering of pixel images but type design needs to see how a printer pours pixels into a bezier outline--how does it choose to deal with rounding, how much hinting affects the output, how it interprets PostScript, how much toner spread it generates, etc.. At large sizes, this is less of an issue but at text sizes, it can be quite significant.
I even notice a difference using the same printer and type if it comes from the originating app like InD or from a PDF generated from it. Oddly enough, even Adobe products like InD and PDF don't always match when printed to a laser printer. I don't know if this is do to PostScript interpreter, the operating system rendering, or differences in the way each software sends to the rendering device.

? Did I say images? Sorry if I was unclear, Chris – it was text he printed/scanned (Optima at 8pt). But there was no control over the paper used etc., so it's obviously not going to be the Ultimate Answer (but still interesting).
I would have permission to post an image if people are interested.
BTW, I know that other problem; my printer's output is useless directly from InDesign – I make PDFs of everything. :-\</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thomas:
Could it be a PPD vs. CUPS issue?
Or print at PostScript Level II instead? Or print to PDF instead?
Brother implements "BR-Script3" emulation on its lasers, at least in this price range. All I can tell so far is that 1200dpi text printed from the HL-5370DW is crisp and beautiful. But that's not much of a Postscript test. I don't really use Adobe products, either. I do the odd thing in Quark Xpress8, though I haven't had time to test this printer with it. This printer is strictly for text, used with Apple's Pages application.
What is the best test for Postscript emulation quality?
Of course a Laserwriter 8500 is still an option. Always one for sale somewhere. ;)

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, no control over the paper. Basically this is what he said:
"I went to Media Markt to look at mono laser printers but there was no
good information or examples of the quality. So, I did an experiment:
I asked friends and colleagues to print out a sample on their laser
printer, and scanned in the results.
The attached image is 8pt Optima scanned at 1200 dpi. At the top and
the bottom, you can see how it "should" look, and in between, the scan
from each printout. As you can see there is quite a difference between
the printers. (Of course there will also be differences because of
different paper, older toner, etc, etc, but I couldn't control that.)"

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, that does make sense, and I would like to have an offset sample in there.
But my point was that if the offset print (which readers see) is somewhat tightly sandwiched between the laser print (which we see) and the actual outlines (which is what we control), quality-wise, and all these are as close together as possible, then that should still work out OK (I'm thinking).
BTW, I don't know about you guys, but I'm getting about as much stuff digitally printed as offset, and from talking to printers and colleagues I'm thinking this might be a trend industry-wide. So laser printing isn't just for testing…</div>

<div class=commentbody>The thing is, using "lino" output to judge a font is in some way even more removed from readers than a (hi-res) laser. Which however doesn't make it useless; the void it fills is the space between seeing huge glyphs onscreen (where you're not really reading) and offset repro (which is prohibitive in cost/time for something as highly iterative as type design). The problem is it's become very difficult to get "lino" output.
So the hi-res laser can actually be more than an intermediary: it strikes a great balance between realism and cost. You see something in effect close to offset repro, quickly and cheaply. It's not enough to pull off any project, but it can do 95% of the job in most cases.
BTW, how would you compare digital output versus offset?

<div class=commentbody>Oh, ok. Like proof printing? That sounds pretty great (and seems like something that used to be used more before I was around). :-\
Quality: Bear in mind I've been at this "seriously" for a year or so now, so I'm hardly an expert* (and it's not like I print three books every week). But some impressions are that digital output (1) is almost always darker [in terms of type weight], and (2) varies a lot depending on technical stuff that's outside of my reach as a designer, for example in terms of curve fidelity (and something that looks like exposure, which probably doesn't make much sense technically).
Offset to me seems generally sharper, "truer" to the actual forms,** less "spread out"; but it tends to vary in other terms, such as depending on the soaky-ness of the paper, and the amount of color… uh coverage?. And one thing about offset that is muchly different of course (and much nicer for reading, I think) is how the color sits "inside" the paper, and isn't a tactile (and sometimes shiny) thing sitting on top of the paper, like in digital. Plus the contrast is usually less crass, since offset black isn't the Super-Shiny-Extra-Enriched-Super-Black that some toner manufacturers seem to think everybody wants…
* Shouldn't *I* be asking *you* this question? :)
** Hence my hypothesis before (which is ready to be shot down if it's wrong) of offset quality/fidelity being "sandwiched" somewhere between digital and the outlines.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just ran some quick tests with my new Brother HL-5370DW.
Printing options include:
300 dpi
600 dpi
HQ 1200 (2400x600 interpolated)
1200 dpi (true 1200x1200)
When printing text in 2400x600, there is some inordinate thickening in certain areas of the fonts - usually the sides.
When printing text in 1200x1200, the fonts look better - crisp and clear.
Seems 2400x600 (or HQ 1200) is meant for graphics, is it not?</div>

It's meant for tricking people into thinking
they're buying a 2400 dpi printer. It works. :-(

<div class=commentbody>Well at least in the marketing info and on the box, 1200dpi is one of the main selling points, and seems to be promoted over the "HQ1200" or 2400x600dpi feature.
"Prints up to 1200 dpi" is emblazoned clearly on the box. There is no mention at all of 2400x600 or any "HQ 1200" feature.
I take it to be a rather heartening sign in a sea of otherwise gimmicky features on printers that are steadily getting worse in build quality. Or maybe I'm making too much of it. It's just that had I not done the research beforehand, I too might have been taken in by the 2400x600 ploy.

Nina, this is a reasonable working assumption. The trick is the nature of "sandwiched", because it may not be a neatly linear interpolation.
When reviewing laser proofs of a type design in progress, I find it useful to periodically "calibrate" my brain. For this purpose I keep laser prints of a few layouts of Whitman which can be directly compared with a couple real-world printed samples -- magazines and books, both coated and uncoated stocks.

But it *is* in between? Or would you say (judging from your variety of samples) that offset prints [can] diverge from the original outline in fundamentally different ways than laser prints — so, ways that laser prints could not help you anticipate?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think that last comment is correct, Nina. ‘Sandwiched’ implies a kind of continuum on which one can plot different examples of output in terms of relative fidelity or degradation. But this doesn't enable us to account for different kinds of degradation. A better way to think about the relationship of typefaces as output to typefaces as source would be a scattershot projection, in which the typeface as source is in the middle, and individual examples of output surround it, closer or further away depending on quality of fidelity and radially arranged in terms of type of degradation. Seen like this, the variety of output is appropriately overwhelming.</div>
