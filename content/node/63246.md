  time. I know this thread already kinda exists http://www.typophile.com/node/7703
  but I was wondering if anyone has come across any good examples of the pointing
  finger within a font?\r\n\r\nEither free or licensed, I'm not bothered just can't
  find much reference.\r\n\r\nActually, this is one but there must be more.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/steve-mehallo/alta-california/\r\n"

  body: "It's not clear if you're specifically looking for vintage-style pointing
    fists, or if you're referring to the typographic fist itself as a vintage relic.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_scala_hands/|FF
    Scala Hands]] is a great collection of variations.\r\n\r\nDavid Jonathan Ross
    included some pointing fists in his recently released [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Trilby/charset|Trilby]]
    from Font Bureau.\r\n\r\nJonathan Hoefler's Fell Type Roman, from the [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_inside.php?wipID=16&productLineID=100012|Historical
    Allsorts]] set, has a couple vintage pointing fists (but I don't see any way of
    inspecting them via their website).\r\n\r\n"
