  body: Looks like Aldus, Electra Italic, and various weights and widths of Helvetica
    to me.

  body: The Helvetica parts are actually horizontally stretched Helvetica Condensed.
    The logo is Palatino, except for the "A" which appears to be custom.

    think it's slightly expanded. And certainly the A has been violated."

    it's indeed Palatino (which one exactly, it's a different matter)."

    is what it looked like in the end.\r\nSupposed to be a new product with an existing
    company. \r\nmine was healthy energy for teens via tea form.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Package_design_Print_3780.jpg]"

  body: You're right, it's Palatino. The weight is throwing me off, which might be
    trapping or ink gain. Even Palatino Light is too heavy around the serifs of the
    S.
