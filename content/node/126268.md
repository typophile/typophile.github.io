body: "I created the font Oscar Bravo based on the NATO phonetic alphabet after a
  visit to Duxford Air Museum just outside of Cambridge, UK, where the whole history
  of aviation is represented in a series of exhibits ranging from early prop planes
  to supersonic jetliners.\r\n\r\nIn response to popular demand this font is now available
  in \u2018Scotch\u2019 and \u2018Irish\u2019 versions.  If you take your whiskey
  with an \u2018e\u2019 choose Oscar Bravo Whiskey. If you prefer it neat, choose
  Oscar Bravo. And no, I am not going to bring out an Oscar Bravo Bourbon version!
