  festival and would like to find a serif typeface to use in the body copy.

  body: "For a magazine redesign I paired Proxima Nova with Freight from Joshua Darden.
    It has a great range of weights and contrasts nicely with the geometric sans.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/freight+darden/fonts/\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "These examples are from a 2009 issue of Arrive, Amtrak's onboard magazine.
    It combines Proxima Nova, Freight, and a little Mousse Script as an accent.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arrive_type1_4130.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arrive_type3_3842.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arrive_type2_3916.gif]"

  body: Thanks for the suggestions. Freight might work, it is for a film festival
    celebrating David Lean's films. Dr. Zhivago, Bridge Over the River Kwai, Lawrence
    of Arabia. Film fests name is EPIC. I set EPIC with Proxima Nova.
