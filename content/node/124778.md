  font 'dosis' by Edgar Tolentino and Pablo Impallari.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a university
  project, creating a typographic specimen and I'm looking for as much information
  about the font as possible, in particular, what it was originally designed for and
  where the name came from. If anyone could help that would be extremely helpful.
  \r\n\r\nKind regards and thanks in advance for your help!\r\n\r\nHayley"
