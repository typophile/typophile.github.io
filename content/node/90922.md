  is a hi-res scan of Pan Books' 1964 edition of A Clockwork Orange. At first I thought
  I saw hints of a version of Garamond, but then the 'j' and the 's' do not comply.

  body: Isn't Bembo Book only a fairly recent digital addition though? But is what
    you mean, since there are discrepancies between the original print of the print
    and current digitisations of Bembo, then it makes sense to compare it with Bembo
    Book?

    you can get.

    seems to me like Garamond in parts (unless I'm just seeing it everywhere), though
    trouble is there are so many versions nowadays. "
