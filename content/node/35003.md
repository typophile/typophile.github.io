  body: "> May this be a custom work?\r\n\r\nI guess that for logos, this is a likely
    occurrence. It is interesting to notice that in the SDMO leaflets, when they need
    a \"compound\" logo, either they use another font for \"SDMO\" or mix the original
    logo with some other font. Here is an example\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MicsTELYS_5255.jpg]\r\nwhere,
    according Acrobat, the font used for \"Mics TELYS\" is \"Ostara\" (?). This being
    said, I am no designer. "
