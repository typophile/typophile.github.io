  is almost similar to the NO movement type which is http://www.dafont.com/n-o-movement.font?text=fridge+pal
  . The guy who created the \"fridge pal\" type tends to disagree with this and thinks
  it's just a teeny bit similar.\r\n\r\nthanks for any all comments."

    does the second one seem based on Futura to anybody else?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
