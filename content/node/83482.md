body: "Dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm the happy owner of an old small letterpress.\r\nI'm
  trying to identify the machine and year of production.\r\nCan anyone here identify
  it? I can understand (to dirty) the logo embenbed in the machine. I tryed to take
  a picture but its on a hard place.\r\nI managed to \"get a simple\" design of the
  logo and what I think is some letters, but I dont find any similar names on letterpress
  supplier on a web search...\r\nThe seller said that the machine could be from the
  1920's.\r\nCan anyone here identify this?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3209_6393.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3213_4321.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3213a_3994.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3213b_6041.jpg]"

    read the name correctly: A. Hogenforst was a manufacturer of \u2018Tiegelpressen\u2019
    in Leipzig. You could try asking Jens J\xF8rgen Hansen, he has a few pictures
    of a Hogenforst leaflet on Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bogtrykkeren/3546176794/in/set-72157618477822478/"

    mailing list]] which seems to be read by lots of people who might know the answer.

  body: The type of press is called a Platen Press.  they come in many styles but
    the basic mechanics of them are pretty much the same.  I couldn't tell you any
    more about the press but I can find out for you.  I am a volunteer at the international
    printing museum in Los Angeles [[www.printmuseum.org]] I will be there this saturday
    and could bring pictures to show some of the guys.

  body: "Thanks everybody!\r\nSo I saw correctly...eh eh\r\n\r\nFlorian Hardwig \r\nI
    dont see anywhere an email I could use to ask Jens J\xF8rgen Hansen more info.
    Do you have it or know here I can get it?\r\n\r\ninkxel \r\nThats great news if
    you could do that. I'm trying to identify it first and get some info/manual latter.
    I know its hard but it would be nice to see if any manual of this machine exists
    (not for operating it but for complete the set).\r\n\r\nAF"

  body: "Hi Jens!\r\n\r\nThanks for bringing your expertise :)\r\nI dont think it
    can be a Stabil II. Perhaps a Stabil...\r\nMy machine dont have 3 rollers (only
    2) neither that extra roller on top of the ink plate...\r\nThe machine mesures
    +/- 55x50x72cm\r\nThe printable area is +/- 20x18cm (8x7?)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAntonio"

  body: "Well, it\u2019s a Stabil II. The ink reservoir  is missing, but you can still
    see the base for it under the ink dish. The roller arms are also manufactured
    for three rollers \u2013 2 form rollers and one for the reservoir. There is an
    extra set of holes in the roller arms for a third roller hook. The missing hooks
    and roller has been removed together with the reservoir sometime in the past.
    \r\n18x20 cm. is that the size of the platen, the bed or???? I think your press
    must be a Stabil II EH\r\nGott gr\xFC\xDF die Kunst\r\nJens\r\n"

    of the parts and I'm not near the machine now so I can't mesure. But the seller
    said the 18x20cm is the printable area, so its the platen chase, rigth?\r\nDo
    you have any docs (diferent from the flickr pages) about this machine: Stabil
    II EH? Like a manual, booklett or year of production?\r\nI also opened a type
    ID post [[http://www.typophile.com/node/83485|here ]]in order to get some help
    in identify the typefaces that came with the machine. Perhaps you could help..its
    getting dificult...\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAntonio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
