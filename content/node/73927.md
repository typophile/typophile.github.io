  feature. This is the first time I use this feature in my fonts. I create the feature
  using this exactly code:\r\n\r\nfeature hist { \r\n   sub s by longs; \r\n} hist\r\n\r\nwhen
  I compile it, it shows the error message\r\n\r\n[FATAL] <Penabico> aborting because
  of errors:\r\nsyntax error at \"feature\"\r\n[C:/Users/Paulo W/Documents/FontLab/Studio5/fontlab.fea
