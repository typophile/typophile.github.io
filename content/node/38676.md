body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI'm in need of some opinions on what would be a nice body font
  to compliment Eurostile headings.\r\n\r\nI'm not keen on using Eurostile for both,
  as it can come across as 'techy'. I think a Sans or Humanist would be the direction
  I'm looking for...\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts/suggestions?"

  body: Any legible font that contrasts with Eurostile. Preferably a roman type such
    as Garamond

  body: "Hmm, Garamond you say... I don't think a serif is the direction I want to
    go with this layout. It's not masses of body text, just keywords and bullet points.
    * Why must clients choose fonts like Eurostile?!? *\r\n\r\nThanks though for the
    suggestion Robert."

  body: Although I wasn't keen on a Serif, I did stumble across [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/melior/|Melior]],
    do you think that would compliment Eurostile? It has the almost square edges like
    Eurostile

  body: "Melior doesn't give you much contrast, since it's also somewhat square. How
    about a nice schoolbook-type, say New Century Schoolbook for example? The letterspacing
    would be similar.\r\n"

  body: How about Chaparral it's a Slab Serif. It's square serifs may compliment Eurostyle.

  body: Not to be schoolmarmy but I think you mean "complementary". Complimentary
    means you don't want to pay for it.

  body: "@ ryanholmes - A little too serif and 'standard' for my liking. Thanks for
    the suggestion.\r\n\r\n@ Big B - Nice suggestion. I will give that a go.\r\n\r\n@
    pattyfab - Thanks for the heads up\r\n\r\n@ Stephen Coles - It's a 6pp DL brochure
    for a company that manufactures lattice and aluminium slats for screening/privacy/decorative
    purposes."
