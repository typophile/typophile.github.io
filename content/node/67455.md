  body: "Yeah, I had quite a long browse for this one yesterday and couldn't recognise
    it. The closest I could get was Caslon Graphique, Tiffany or Bodoni Poster, none
    of which were very close. I even had a look at things like Veljovic and Publico.\r\n\r\nWhat
    they did with the Y makes me think it could be custom, but it's a very good job
    if that's the case. Looks like the I and A have a special interaction too.\r\n\r\nThe
    R should be a dead giveaway and the design of C is funky too.\r\n\r\nI'd guess
    others have had no luck either, it would be unusual for nobody to have had a look
    at this."
