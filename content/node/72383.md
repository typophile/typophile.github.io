  problem is that the characters are quite crowded. I was wondering if there was a
  solve to this or a similar font.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks,\r\nOl "

    even Microsoft Word allows it. Just add more space between the characters.

  body: "Thanks, Ive tried this and unfortunately due to the nature of the font, it
    requires a large amount of spacing to put it right which distorts the test. Thanks
    once again for your input.\r\n\r\nYours in typography,\r\n\r\nOl"
