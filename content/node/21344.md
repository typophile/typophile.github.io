body: "While on holiday recently, I was looking for type in a village church yard,
  and came across this peculiar lettering.\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to say 'Sacred', but
  I've never seen an r like that before, (or S, c or e for that matter).\r\n\r\nBear
  in mind that the year is 1849 in a very remote area of Cornwall.\r\n\r\nAny clues
  anyone?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sacred_6643.jpg]"
