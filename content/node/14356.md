  to use it for everything that will leave the building, but not every machine has
  the typeface installed. We are being completely legal and licensed it for the critical
  machines, but we can't realistically put it on every machine. Is there a typeface
  found in Windows PCs that would be an acceptable substitute?\r\n\r\nThe electronic
  default for web and emails is Verdana, but the sizes aren't equivalent (ie. 8pt
  does not = 8pt)\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice,\r\nScott"

    target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Office</a>.\r\n\r\nSo if your company has Office installed
    on the machines give that font a try."

    budget for it. Whether that is licensing the font, paying IT to install it or
    just the VP not wanting to deal with it, I don't know. \r\n\r\nThanks for the
    recommendations, everyone."

  body: Universalis ADF isn't Futura, but has a lot of Futura in it. Might be worth
    looking at if you're OK with the GPL.

  body: "Some of the other Arkandis typefaces look interesting, although I did not
    find Universalis particularly impressive. From the [[http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/|site]],
    though, while the logo says \"Free fonts for free publication\", on [[http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/adffonts.html|this
    page]] it is noted that the GPL v2 applies with the <em>font exception</em>.\r\n\r\nSo
    I don't think you have to GPL any text you typeset in these faces. I'm not sure
    how else the GPL could be a concern."

  body: GPL weenies insist that embedding a GPLed font forces the GPL onto the document,
    hence the font exception, which counteracts that. Personally, I think the Arkandis
    gang thinks more like libre-free than gratis-free.
