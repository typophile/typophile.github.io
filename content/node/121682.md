  body: "The script is called, not surprisingly, Scrap Calligraphy:\r\nhttp://www.scrapnfonts.com/searchdetail.php?psku=1248\r\n\r\nBickley
    Script would be a decent, foundry-quality substitute:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bickley-script/\r\n\r\nThe
    serif typeface matches to something called Times NR 60 (someone we love is in
    heaven) and Times NR 80 (heaven), though I can\u2019t find a source for it; essentially,
    it\u2019s just condensed versions of Times New Roman:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/times-new-roman/\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Found a source for Times NR 60 and 80:\r\nhttp://www.paperlesshymnal.com/shapnote/
