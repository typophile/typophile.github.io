  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">While discussing typography over dinner, my friend and I ended up talking about designers we knew. His impression where that most designers are arrogant, bitter and often very negative. Thinking through my own experiences, I realized I had crossed paths with quite a few visual artists fitting that description as well. 

Now, I truly hope this is not the case. I feel most typophiles are very humble and helpful in dialog with youngsters & newbies, like myself. 

What's your impression?</div>

Did I mention that it's entirely brush painted, save for the original light blue detailing? 10 cd changer and obligatory seat cover?

Keys are in the ignition. It's over in the city lot by the local tire shop. This, friends, is living.

Thanks Chuck; I'm sitting skimming Typophile while my two English classes write their final exam and your comment just made me burst out laughing, which I think some of the students may have taken the wrong way. A good laugh is always welcome, even for the arrogant and bitchy.</div>

He was being very apt and very witty, like David himself. I think David Berlow is incredibly funny. All typophiles are modest, sweet, very positive and very witty.

		<div class="commentbody">I think we operate in environments where lots of people have opinions about design (informed and uninformed) so iIt's natural for a designer to weigh in heavily at times. I have seen the developers here get in more heated debate than the designers at times. In development and design there are right and wrong ways to do things, and huge grey subjective areas in the middle.

But, just don't confuse strong opinions with cockiness. If people think you're cocky it's because you're delivering your opinions wrong.

In my experience the only people that fit the description you gave are when kids are right out of school and have the "right" talent and get into "right" job. These traits (arrogance, etc.) don't serve them very well in the real world and they learn. You can imagine the same thing happening with bright medical students or engineering students who excel and get great positions. 

I've only ever met one seasoned designer who was actually a true jerk. I admired this guy for years (and bought his books) but meeting him in person was a disappointment. Like I said, though, that's been a major exception. 

(Oh, and my primary mode of transportation is black, and it's Italian. But it's not a car. =)</div>

James click the contact thingy on my user page and drop me a line---I will mail you a check or money order to help pay your bills. Yes really, I mean it.

I owned a Jaguar once, a Mark III saloon made back in the 1970's when Jaguars still had massive quality problems. Very nice plush town car but it kept falling to bits, and the servicing requirements were wallet-threatening to say the least. Also try---fueling a barbeque with $50 notes.

		<div class="commentbody">James,

I had a 2001 Jaguar S-Type - and it had as many problems as the old Jags did. And to think - not one Lucas part in it - ahuh! I was delighted when I sold it. And since I never wanted to see it again - I was thrilled when here I am on the Southeast coast of the USA and it was bought by a man on the Northwest coast of the USA. Every now and then I get an email from him as to what he has done to the car, and he is always so happy. (After all, he got it for a song....and I was happy selling it to him.)

Sorry about your BMW Logomotives -- that's a nice car to have. I visited recently the BMW plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, didn't care for the robots making them - they had no personalities to speak of -- however, I did enjoy the few "driving experiences" they reserved for our group. </div>
