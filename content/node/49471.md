body: "Found article on \"the Geometry of Roman Lettering\" (by Tom Perkins) that
  argues for geometry underpinning classical inscriptions. He goes through the alphabet,
  finding the rectangles that best fit the rubbings: A is based on a double Golden
  Rectangle, B is based on a root-five rectangle, C on a double root-five rectangle,
  etc.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced. (It seems that there's a geometric rectangle of one
  kind or another passably close to every letter size, so I suspect geometry arises
  after the fact to account for the proportions rather than dictating them in advance.)
  But I think I'll take Perkins' boxes as a starting point for the cap proportions
  for my font.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking the the more cursive branching forms of the lowercase
  I've been toying with should be left out of the caps, though maybe could be designed
  as quasi-swash variants."

    My guess would be the eye was the guide with the possible aid of pen widths or
    stroke widths :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Actually you can find the grid in Rudolf Koch's writing book. It is not geometric,
    as say some of the contemporary sans. It is based on the square but the widths
    fall outside of the geometric parameters. The M and W are 5/4, and the widths
    range fro 1/2 to 2/3 to 1/1 etc.\r\n\r\nCalligraphers are indeed, if the teacher
    is worth their salt, taught these proportions. Romans are the most difficult and
    demanding of all the calligraphic forms.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    Roman, as have many others, It is a wonderful book but it has limitations. The
    Trajan was never meant to be viewed head on, but viewed from below. So there are
    problems with weight distribution, which can also be seen in contemporary adaptations
    like Trajan by Carol Twombly. Not that it is a bad font.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "My Calligraphy teacher taught us those proportions but we never were taught
    to measure them--we just visualized them and allowed them as proportion groupings.
    I was referring to the difference between drafting, a la Durer, and Calligraphic
    writing where the eye is the judge, not the ruler or compass.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "You are not wrong Chris. I am not saying that, it is just that the proportions
    are an intimate lesson for the calligrapher. It is quite obsessive but rarely
    used by contemporary designers. You are right though... it ultimately becomes
    the eye that defines the proper rendering of letters. \r\n\r\nMichael"
