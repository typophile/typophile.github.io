  called \"Why are all beautifull books from Schweiz?\". At this exibition I found
  a catalog from the yearly held book design competition i Schweiz called \"Die sch\xF6nsten
  Schweizer B\xFCcher\" and in this catalog i noticed a typeface that was not introduced
  in the font section and I would very much like to know what font it is. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schweiz_5455.jpg]"

  body: "Thank you Renko for Fedra Sans and thanks to everyone else for the extra
    info.\r\nAltaira, Switzerland are very serious about book design and the government
    supports it as well as many welthy private sponsors. Lars M\xFCller Publishers
    is one exampel, even though Lars was born in Norway. Overall Switzerland has a
    deep respect for graphic design and there is an abundance of \"high quality\"
    graphic design in the society. "

  body: "Oh I wasn't being ironic! Just surprised. I think it's not uncommon that
    when you're inside a place, you don't realize if it's \"important\" on a global/overall
    scale; you only see that from a distance. I can confirm your point about the \"deep
    respect for graphic design\" and maybe also that there is much good design here
    (though of course there's also much crap, like anywhere). I wasn't aware of our
    reputation regarding books in particular\u2026 so thanks anyway :)"
