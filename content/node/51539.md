  creative agency, what would it be?\r\n\r\nFor example - \r\n\r\nSound = Headphones/Speakers,
  \r\nVideo = Video Camera/Filmstrip, \r\nPhotography = Camera/Film Canister, \r\nGraphic
  Design = ?\r\n\r\nPS - Not a Mac!"

  body: The CMYK thingie is no longer as relevant as it was 10 years ago. Graphic
    designer work both online and and in print now. Something more basic like an illustrating
    hand may be suitable. It's a jolly hard one, as the the times, they are a changing...!
