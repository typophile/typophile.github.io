  body: "The most similar I have been able to find so far is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/buckethead/\">Buckethead</a>
    from Chank. This seems like a ruggedized mostly Latin style, although the R tail
    is not a typical Latin attribute, I think.\r\n\r\nI also looked at the two Latino
    fonts from House, but the shapes are quite different, regardless of the 'roughening'.\r\n\r\nI'd
    guess this is a freebie somewhere.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
