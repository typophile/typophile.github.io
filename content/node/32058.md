  least to me. I've spent almost a day on this one and cannot come up with a close
  match, so it could be a tweaked font. The R and M are the keys - R has a rounded
  leg and the M looks, well, wrong somehow.\r\n\r\nThanks for trying !\r\n\r\nregards

  body: "Hello Stephen. The font is part of a company logo, the original designer
    is not around anymore. I took up from there and need to find out what the font
    is in order to do integrate it further in their CI. The other problem is that
    the logo is only available as a small .tiff and needs to be vectorized.\r\nDo
    you have any pointers as what the font may be? I\xB4m pretty clueless but I\xB4m
    thinking that that M is a mirrored W... just a wild guess though - I\xB4m sure
    people have a better eye here. Thanks for the interest !\r\n\r\nPeter"

  body: It's some sort of bastardised frutiger, with, as you say, the M being an inverted
    W... the W looks as if it might even have been taken from another typeface...
    not nice, not nice at all!

  body: "Hi Brett - yep, it's a mix of all sorts - there is a Quay Sans and one from
    The Foundry, Form Sans in it. I recognized the latter because it's one of my all
    time favourites and yes, it's an inverted W.\r\n\r\nOh man. I'll fix this mess
    up - stuff like this gives me knots in my brain... At least I have the pleasure
    of undoing the damage. Ever tried inverting a Comic Sans? Now <em>that</em> is
    nice...   "
