body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have been searching for some elegant slightly informal brush
  drawn script fonts, but with the unusual specificity of being non-slanted, like
  the tradition wants.\r\nA good example of the \"looks\" I'm searching for is linotype's
  pepita, but in a less right-slant-look concept. Sadly, for some reason all \"vertical-looking\"
  brushscript fonts I was given to see looked uneasy and quite in-elegant.(Most probably
  because they get less  curves to express their character).\r\n\r\nThanks for any
  suggestions,\r\n\r\nPaul-Kenji Cahier"

  body: "Thanks all for the suggestions.\r\nThere is this smoothness, clarity yet
    hand-made brush feeling in pepita that is so hard to find around. The variations
    in width/alignement are for a good part of that. That and some non-typical forms.\r\n\r\nThe
    one matching the most from what was suggested would be Mr Rafkin:\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000080\r\n\r\nI'm
    particularly fond(in this case) of the caps of pepita, like the 'P'.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    all suggestions are still welcome.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nOn a side note, I'm liking
    a lot the looks of gizmo(even if not what I need in this case), it's really nice
    to see such an informal yet elegant face.\r\n"
