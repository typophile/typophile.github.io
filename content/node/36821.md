  Schiller ring a bell for anyone? Printer, type designer, artist? Around early 1900s
  to 1940s?

    Schiller</strong>, born in Hamburg, 1920. Could that be your man?\r\n\r\nAnd according
    to <em>An A-Z of Type Designers</em>, Walter Schiller co-authored a book with
    Albert Kapr: <em>Gestalt und Funktion der Typografie</em> (1977, 1983). Both men
    taught at the Hochschule f\xFCr Graphik und Buchkunst (HGB) in Leipzig.\r\n\r\n(By
    the way, no entries for an Arthur Schiller in either book, or others I consulted.)"

    collection titled <a href=\"http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/jhnsn_f.htm\">Fridof

    of subject files created by Johnson and arranged in alphabetical order, consists
    of information on particular people and topics. This series represents one of
    the collection\u2019s strengths, as it contains a vast amount of material on prominent
    graphic artists, printers, and typographers with whom Johnson worked or corresponded.
    Included in his archive are the names Albert Schiller, Eric Gill, John Lehman,
    Rudolph Ruzicka, Paul Bennett, Warren Chappell, Frederick</strong> [sic] <strong>Goudy,

    Schiller could be pronounced and therefore sound a bit like Speer.

  body: My grandfather was a typesetter/compositor who worked with Albert Schiller
    at Advertising Agencies' Service Co.  Mr. Schiller used to give a new print to
    his co-workers every Christmas. My grandfather set many of them.  They're gorgeous.  I'm
    dying to know how many are out there, and if there's some we could buy somewhere.  He
    didn't sign them anywhere that I can see, so it may be hard to track them down.  My
    grandfather said Mr. Schiller had a vision of art for the masses - affordable,
    ect.  I know this conversation is a couple of months old, but if you're still
    checking in, I thought you might want more information!   DK
