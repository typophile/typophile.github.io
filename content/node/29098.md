  especially ironic given the name of the movie: <em><a href=\"http://www.requiemthemovie.com/\"
  title=\"View the movie site\">Requiem</a></em>. I guess they tried to set the title
  apart by customizing the R and the E, although I think they butchered the latter.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/header_6081.jpg]"

    because movie posters (and other promotional materials) have gone from being beautifully
    illustrated designs to quicky Photochops. If you want to make a Photochop look
    elegant, tossing Trajan on top is a logical (note I said logical, not good) way
    to go and doesn't require any real effort. \r\n\r\nIt might also be because Spielberg
    keeps using Trajan, and a lot of people in Hollywood will try anything to be cool
    like Spielberg, and since they can't make a movie like him..."

    movie posters... I can say, yes, these people do not stray from Trajan. It was
    annoying as hell. Setting beautiful type never cut it. It looked boring to them.
    They wanted filters, bevels, drop shadows, and textures. It had to 'pop'. The
    most common reason for using Trajan: This movie needs to feel like Oscar material.

    I think that the Trajan capitals have been ingrained into Western civilization

    the E's. \r\n\r\nI mean, what ancient Roman tool could chisel perfectly rounded

  body: Aaron Sorkin continues his love affair with Trajan in the title cards for
    his new show, "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip." Now, Trajan made sense when used
    on "The West Wing," but it just looks like overkill for a show about a sketch
    comedy show.
