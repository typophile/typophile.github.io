    of Notre Dame, and that we were therefore looking for a quasi-serif face. Or something.
    If there's some 'Parry' connection, I didn't get it."

  body: "The madness has somewhat subsided but Typo Berlin looms at the horizon, so
    I'll quickly post a new challenge. Here's what Stephen had to say about the previous
    one:\r\n\r\n<em>The sample is \u2018Ondine,\u2019 named after the sea nymph in
    Nordic mythology, and designed (as I learned to my great surprise) by Adrian Frutiger
    in 1954. Of course there\u2019s no reason why he can\u2019t design a scripty typeface,
    but when you\u2019re used to associating Frutiger with faces like Univers, Avenir
    and Frutiger, etc, something like this comes as a shock. I was impressed to read
    on the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1301/ondine-family.html\">Linotype site</a>
    that \"he actually used scissors to cut the forms out of a piece of black paper,
    a technique that requires the vision and skill of an artist to exploit its apparent
    simplicity.\"</em>\r\n\r\nSo, where did that clue come from? Check your <a href=\"http://warholstars.org/indfoto/iondine.html\">art
    and cinematic history</a>. ;^)"
