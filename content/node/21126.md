  college. (One was called Pill Popper, which can still be downloaded off of 1001fonts.com)\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I designed these using some Windows program called FCP - Font Creator Program -
  which I think I bought online from about \xA320. It was okay, but given my lack
  of font design skills, I spent ages forming one character! I also didn't have much
  of a clue about how things should be spaced, kerned, etc...\r\n\r\nI've been graphic
  designing for three years in book publishing -  I want to get back into designing
  some fonts, even if it is only ever a hobby/personal work.\r\n\r\nI need to know
  where to start. I know that Fontographer is available for OSX, which would set me
  back a few hundred quid. Or is there another option to creating fonts? Can I use
  Illustrator, or Photoshop? Or is there a better alternative to Fontographer?\r\n\r\nAre
  there any suitable books for designing digital typefaces? Recommendations a must!\r\n\r\nApologies
  if you've had loads of email like this before.\r\nBest,\r\nRuss"

  body: "Thanks for the links guys.\r\n\r\nI've been comparing Fontographer with FontLab
    Studio... Fontographer is (much) nearer my budget - but Fontlab Studio has other
    features, but would actually benefit me...\r\nFor example, what is \"TrueType
    hinting\"?\r\n\r\nThere's other things I don't understand, so maybe it's best
    to crawl, then walk before running! Should probaby head down the safer route with
    Fontographer, as a novice! At least it can import EPS files - that way I could
    create some Illustrator letterforms and bring them into Fontgrapher.\r\n\r\nHow
    did you guys start out making fonts? Is the Fontographer software easy to get
    on with? The FCP software I previosuly used was quite basic.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Russ, Fontographer is simpler and quicker to learn - If you know Illustrator
    or Freehand, then it is pretty easy to pick it up. At some point you will want
    to move on to FontLab as you progress.

  body: "I am pretty much a beginner in Font-producing aswell, and by coincidence
    I started with Fontographer. After a couple of weeks I started to love it. If
    you compare the path-tools with Illustrator \u2013 Fontographer is so much better
    and more \"logical\" in a way too.\r\n\r\nThere is really only one thing that
    bothers me about Fontographer, and this is the strange preview. It doesnt show
    (or print out) fonts with a good screen resolution. So if you want to look at
    it on screen, you'll have to use InDesign or similar app. And also print from
    another app.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand; this is also actually rather nice in some
    strange way. It feel a little bit retro - and it doesnt bother mo anymore.\r\nI
    would probably advance to FontLab sometime in the near future UNLESS Fontographers
    big feature update that is coming, implements a better screen preview and some
    Opentype-support. Today it can't produce Opentype-fonts, so if you want to add
    some Opentype-feature, you have to open the Fontographer-file in Fontlab anyway.\r\nDownload
    and test the demo's available at Fontlab.com, and see what appeals to you.\r\n\r\nWith
    the latest CS2 Illustrator you can even copy paste Illustrator vectors. But really,
    you dont gain anything if you start drawing the letters in Illustrator - better
    do them directly in Fontographer (or Fontlab) in my opinion.\r\n\r\nBut, hey -
    just a little warning: Designing Type is like a drug! You can't stop ;-)\r\n\r\n"

    will try them out!\r\nIf Fontlab is the (obvious) progression from Fontographer,
    it might be best to buy that first and save the expense...\r\n\r\nAdmittedly I'm
    thinking of starting with display fonts (like big chunky Designer's Republic fonts)
    and then hopefully moving onto sans and then serif families... crawl before walking!\r\n\r\nAre
    there any \"Dummies Guides\" to the Font Lab and Fontographer software? "
