    other to take information off the page...\r\nWhen it is a good design, the reader
    has to feel comfortable\r\nbecause the letter is both banal and beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n<em>Adrian

    are used, and proportions expertly figured, but anything less than the best is
    awfully dull.\r\n\r\nSo to contradict M. Frutiger: beautiful <em>or</em> banal."
