body: "I really like this bold, sans serif font. Particularly its slightly extended
  width. But I'm having a terrible time finding it among all the thousands of bold,
  sans serif, extended fonts. Can anyone help guide me in the right direction? Suggest
  other keywords to use in tracking this down? Or suggest other web sites besides
  My Fonts?\r\n\r\nThe tail on the \"Q\" could be the tale-tale sign (no pun intended).\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any assistance you can provide."

  body: I don't know this one, but an alternative is Frantisek Storm's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/zeppelin/">Zeppelin.</a>
    I think Akzidenz Grotesk looks much nicer though. :^)

  body: Thanks to you both, but I've considered Zeppelin and AG Extended and actually
    prefer a font called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/anisette/bold/">Anisette
    Bold</a>. Some of its characters are uncomfortably quirky (particularly the J,
    W and K), but fortunately the logo I'm working on doesn't involve any of these
    oddballs. Thanks for your inputs.
