  font. It was great news to me, but all I've found was the pdfs on Brill's webpage.
  It sounds strange it hasn't received much comment or reviews so far -- or am I missing
  something?

  body: "Custom proprietary fonts, even if also made publicly available (for non-commercial
    use), tend not to attract as much comment as new retail font releases. Which is
    fine by me: I know the fonts are getting good use by Brill, and have had some
    nice emails from individuals using them for e.g. Phd dissertations.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're interested in commentary about how the fonts were built, rather than about
    the design, check out this video of the talk <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24-HQ236Tyc\">Text
    to Typeform,</a> which I delivered at Brill's symposium on type and scholarship
    last November. [Apologies for the staggering number of times I say 'um' and 'ur'
    during the talk: I'm barely aware of it while I'm speaking, and always appalled
    when I hear recordings afterwards!]"

    concern using type for what might be considered \"commercial\" work. \"Not-for-Profit\"
    isn't the same thing as \"non-commercial\" -- otherwise, most any university press
    could use these fonts. And that's not the case; they can't.\r\n\r\nI'm not a lawyer
    & don't know, but if you publish journals & there is any fee at all for them,
    even if, in your eye, it is just to cover some of the distribution costs, Brill
    might consider that commercial & outside the license.\r\n\r\nBest might be to
    write Brill & explain your intended uses, if  for any kind of publishing."

    body: "@Charles,\r\n\r\nI see your point. At that time I just wished I had some
      leverage to suggest, as future editor/translator of the publication(s), the
      fonts/look for the actual designer. The experience with the actual design of
      academic journals I published in was rather unpleasant, so I thought, if I'm
      in charge of some publication or other, I won't let a book that cost so much
      in terms of time and money be published, and sold at a reasonable (that is,
      expensive) price, but still in Times New Roman. I always thought that, even
      if the publication is open access and also available online (the case with all
      my published articles), it does deserve some attention.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, all
      I do is just typeset my all articles and handouts for students -- I wouldn't
      dare give them some \"12pt double spaced Times ragged right\" kind of syllabus.\r\n\r\nBut

  body: "Since I have a keyboard which allows exploration of such fonts [*] (and since
    I thought that it would help in showing the docs of the keyboard :-[) I did some
    (really trivial) experiments with the font.  I investigated only diacritics on
    the ffl ligature (and the related topics).  The results are: (a) very nice and
    impressive; (b) showing the limitations of the approach.  (Instead of (b), they
    may be <em>just</em> bugs. ;-)\r\n\r\nI focus on these: \u019A\u0301\u0327 l\u0327\u0301l\u030A\u0301
    l\u0328\u0301.  Note that on \u019A the cedilla is shown as \u2018\u209B\u2019,
    but on l it is shown as comma.  One can put the stress (=acute) mark on l-ogonek,
    but not on l-cedilla. (This might be related to the exponential blowup of number
    of needed OT substitutions; or they may be just bugs\u2026. On the other hand,
    I suspect that one do Unicode-like reordering of diacritics with linearly increasing
    number of rules \u2014 must think about it more\u2026)  (And maybe John just <strong>knows</strong>
    that l\u0327 is never a vowel; I do not know \u2014 I do not speak languages where
    l is a vowel. ;-)\r\n\r\nBut <em>this</em> is just on the theoretical front; I
    did not try to invent a scenario where this would be a real-life problem. The
    major problem for end-user applications is that the font is \u201Ca specialized
    font\u201D, so does not play games with the font environment. A lot of useful
    glyphs are missing (I did not try to time this, but my first impression is that
    the coverage for LCG is about the same as one of DejaVu, which is somewhere about
    end-of-90s/beg-of-00s). And when they are missing, they are not just let be subbed
    by <code>.notdef</code>: they completely disappear (in most of the cases: empty
    0-width glyph) or are drawn as an explicit placeholder glyph (I did not see the
    latter in action, but this is what the <code>character map</code> shows; maybe
    this is circumvented by OT features).\r\n\r\nEssentially, this means that systems
    which pick up a font automatically to show missing glyphs will be confused and
    will think that Brill supports all these \u201Cempty\u201D characters.  Which
    would mess up things enormously \u2014 the text which was shown fine before Brill
    was installed may now be not shown (and not shown in a very disasterous way \u2014
    by just disappearing).  (This is exactly the problem which forced me to start
    to tinker with <code>GNU unifont</code>.)\r\n\r\n  Ex: \u2099\u2098\u2097 \u2C81\u2C97\u2CAB\u2C81
    \u2C83\u2C93\u2C87\u2C81 \u2C85\u2C81\u2C99\u2C81 \uA686\uA681\uA837 \u043D\u2DFA\u0442

  body: "Ilya, in what environment are you testing, and do you know whether OpenType
    GSUB and GPOS are properly supported (note that, for example, there is a bug in
    Adobe InDesign, up to and including CS6, that fails to handle {ccmp} decompositions
    for extended combining mark sequences lookups resulting in incorrect positioning
    of combining marks relative to precomposed diacritic characters that should be
    decomposed by the font).\r\n\r\nIt looks like there may be some issues with multiple
    mark positioning on l. Not sure why, but probably fixable. Thanks.\r\n\r\n<em>Note
    that on \u019A the cedilla is shown as \u2018\u209B\u2019, but on l it is shown
    as comma.</em>\r\n\r\nThat seems to be because some software performs a character
    level substitution of l + combining cedilla to the Baltic \u013C.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you say 'a lot of useful glyphs are missing', I don't know whether you mean glyphs
    or characters. The character set coverage was defined to meet Brill's publishing
    needs. They had an extensive wishlist, based on current publication lists, review
    of existing publications, and new series. Now that the initial release of the
    fonts has been made, I anticipate review of possible additions, including some
    characters that have been added to Unicode since the glyph set was originally
    spec'd.\r\n\r\nThe font contains a clearly identifiable .notdef glyph, and if
    this is not being displayed in place of unsupported characters, then that is a
    software problem, not a font issue. Specifically, I think what you are seeing
    is the result of software not recognising fairly recent Unicode additions as characters,
    and failing to fall back to the .notdef glyph. I pasted your example string into
    Wordad on Windows Vista, and depending on what font I select I get various different
    permutations of invisible and .notdef glyphs. In NotePad, however, I get consistent
    .notdef glyph display for all unsupported characters. This tells me that the problem
    is likely something to do with RichEdit font fallback mechanisms."

    a lot of narrow-rectangle glyphs (e.g., about U+0770 \u2014 but this may be what

  body: "The Windows Character Map is notoriously unreliable as an indicator of what
    a font actually contains, because it makes use of the same system fallback mechanisms
    that also affect -- or afflict -- Wordpad and Word. So, for instance, it will
    display Arabic and Indic characters from a fallback font for pretty much any font,
    even though the font does not support them. For instance, it shows this for Brill,
    even though Brill supports no Indic scripts:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/charmapsucks_6649.png]\r\n\r\nAs
    you note, at other times Character Map shows the .notdef glyph for unsupported
    characters, and sometimes just a blank cell. I long ago concluded that the purpose
    of the Character Map tool is <em>character selection</em>, and there's no point
    to it providing a selection of fonts at all, especially since it's copy-to-clipboard
    function doesn't include font selection formatting.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the
    fallback issues I referred to in Wordpad, this is what I see when I copy your
    example string from FireFox into WordPad and set it in a variety font fonts:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fallbacksucks_3977.png]\r\n\r\nWhat
    you are seeing here is a variety of different failures. Some fonts display .notdef
    for some unsupported characters, none of the fonts display anything at all for
    the U+A6xx range characters, all of the fonts display something recognisable for
    \u043D and \u0442 even though most of them do not actually support those characters
    (i.e. font fallback is being used)."
