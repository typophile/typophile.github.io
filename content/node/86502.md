  Dead\". The original font looks like Din, but it's not. Looks like Swiss 911 Ultra
  Condensed but it's not :)\r\nThe font has both regular (or thin maybe) and bold
  styles.\r\n\r\nOn one of the attached screenshots I have experimented with EF Din
  1451 Std for \"Executive Producer\" title (my version is above) and Swiss 911 Ultra
  Condensed for the producer's name (above again). Neither of them are a match. On
  the second shot, you can see the small caps of the font and especially the small
  \"y\" letter that is not the same as those in the Din or Swiss fonts.\r\n\r\nTried
  WhatTheFont and Fonts.com identification engines, but neither returned any similar
  results better than Din and Swiss. I suspect that since the font is used on the
  main title 'The Talking Dead\" in its probably boldest styles and on both main and
  end titles, it is not a custom font for just the show. \r\n\r\nAppreciate all the
  efforts and your time, guys!\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nKJ"
