  article on how Google runs effective design meetings]]. I particularly like the
  quote:\r\n\r\n\"<em>[[http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#marissa|Mayer]]
  discourages using the phrase \"I like\" in design meetings, such as \"I like the
  way the screen looks.\" Instead, she encourages such comments as \"The experimentation
  on the site shows that his design performed 10% better</em>.\"\r\n\r\nArt versus
  science. Here we go!"

  body: "It might make sense to say something more informative than \"I like the way
    the screen looks\".\r\n\r\nSaying that \"this new design let users find what they
    wanted 10% faster\" is certainly useful, and if the point is to make the screens
    work better, while leaving the aesthetics to one designer recognized as competent
    - because aesthetics are subjective, there's no point debating <em>those</em>
    in committee - this approach may not be all that bad.\r\n\r\nBut it's an approach
    to keep things tightly focused for an organization that is busy and has chiefly
    utilitarian goals. This would not be the way to effectively decide on a new look
    for Avatar II - because here the meeting would be one of creative designers...
    not of computer programmers providing amateur creative input."

  body: "I'm all for collecting data whenever possible and using it to inform design
    wherever possible. But statements such as \"The experimentation on the site shows
    that his design performed 10% better\" sound like hog-wash. No doubt it's taken
    out of context, but as it stands in the article, it begs the question \"10% better
    than what on what metric!?\". \r\n\r\nIn this particular situation (without the
    proper context of course), a statement like \"I like the way the screen looks\"
    is actually more informative. At least I know that someone likes what's there.
    I suppose I'm just disgruntled with the amount of jargon and meaningless word
    salad I hear on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nIt's much like people saying something is
    \"value added\" without explaining where the value has been added. As though uttering
    the phrase actually adds value in some mysterious way. Similarly, the uttering
    of a vague statistic doesn't imbue that statistic with meaning or utility."

    a design department, or is it an external presentation to a group who's natural
    habitat is money, metrics and quantifiability? \r\n\r\nSounds a bit like a naive
    desire from unsteady leadership to impose a mathematical level of order and clarity
    on a discipline that requires a strong coherent aesthetic vision, even in the
    most user-driven testing environments. \r\n\r\nOf course, I've never really thought
    of Google as a thought-leader or haven of design excellence or process-driven
    innovator when it comes to design\u2014at least not at the level of groups like
    Tim Brown's IDEO. \r\n\r\nIn generating excellent, ambitious ideas, Google is
    a fish in water\u2014but at the level of design execution (or even really user-interface
    development) I've always thought of google as still having a bit of a vestigial
    \"engineer's aesthetic.\""

  body: "Art and science are not in conflict. They are complimentary.\r\n\r\nWebsites
    like Google and Amazon are in unique position to quickly measure their own success.
    Google wants people to select the website that will likely have what the user
    is looking for and Amazon wants people to buy things. Both can try different designs
    for very short periods of time to see if people click on a link at a higher rate
    or buy more things respectively.\r\n\r\nIn order to try different designs, someone
    had to design the new design. Design didn\u2019t go away. The experimentation
    on the site measures whether the new design has a higher click rate or buy rate
    than the previous design. And the story doesn\u2019t end there, because new design
    ideas are still needed to keep improving the click rate and buy rate.\r\n"

  body: "I don't see \u2018science\u2019 as involved in this situation at all. It
    is a matter of art and utility, which may be either complimentary or in conflict
    in any given situation. Art and utility are often complimentary because humans
    value art -- by which I mean the extra-utile component of things -- and respond
    positively to it, enhancing the utility of a thing by making more people want
    to engage with it. Art and utility will be in conflict, however, if a design that
    people find more attractive aesthetically actually functions less well than another,
    less attractive design.\r\n\r\nThere is also the matter of branding to consider,
    because while a company may generally favour utility over art when they are in
    conflict, this may be moderated if the better functioning design is inconsistent
    with or undermines an established visual identity in which the company has invested."
