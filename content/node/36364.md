  file/name of typeface used in the logo (big shock, right?). \r\n\r\nAnyway, I've
  never seen this typeface before and I've searched for hours on the web and- no luck.\r\n\r\nplease
  help me out here, guys!  Someone here knows... :o \r\n\r\nHere are the bitmaps from

  body: "If you want another opnion, I agree with Jan -- this looks like it is hand-drawn.
    The 's' seems too large, and the h's seem not to be exactly identical. The 'r'
    is an odd style, and I found very few scripts with a printed-but-connected letterform
    such as this. The original version of Signal had a similar 'r' (shown in the Jaspert
    'Encyclopaedia of Type Faces'), but the Berthold digital version of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/signal-bq/\">Signal</a>
    does not. In fact, the only script I could find with this sort of 'r' is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/roman-script/\">Roman
    Script</a>, and it is a vertical script, with no other resemblance to this sample.\r\n\r\nThe
    'F' is not like any other script F I can recall.\r\n\r\nThe two most similar fonts
    I found to the look of this sample, and it's just my viewpoint, are Mandate (a.k.a.
    <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/freehand-521/\">Freehand 521</a>)
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/monoline-script/\">Monoline
    Script</a>.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike-\r\n\r\nMy initial reaction to this 'font' was exactly the same as you
    described above ^^^.\r\nOnly conclusion I didn't come to was that it was probably
    hand drawn and thus not an actual typeface at all.  I think you're right. The
    letters just don't make sense otherwise.\r\n\r\nWell, now I know I can stop wasting
    time searching for a non-exsistant font, and begin the ever so tedious character
    tracing.  My hand will be cramped up after work today, that's for sure. sigh\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the advice, guys!\r\nvery helpful!\r\n\r\n-Amanda   "
