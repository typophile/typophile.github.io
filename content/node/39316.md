  reveals ceiling of grotto under Palatine hill </a>\r\n\r\n<em>Rome has revealed
  what its leading archeologist says is \"one of the greatest discoveries ever made,\"
  a lost shrine dedicated to the ancient city's mythical founders. Andrea Carandini
  told a press conference yesterday that a large vaulted hall beneath the Palatine
  hill was almost certainly the fabled Lupercale \u2013 a sanctuary believed by ancient
  Romans to be the cave where the twin boys Romulus and Remus were suckled by a she-wolf.
  The professor acknowledged the evidence was as yet not totally conclusive, but said
  only \"one doubt in thousand\" remained.</em>\r\nJohn Hooper\r\nNovember 21, 2007"
