<p>it looks
a) like an upside-down ‘M’, because the outer diagonals usually are more inclined, in a ‘W’
and
b) mirrored, because the contrast axis is in opposition to the tradition of translation-based (broad nib pen) contrast, and also what other letters like the ‘s’ suggest.

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about this. It&rsquo;s possible to hold the nib at a different angle right? Couldn&rsquo;t the standard nib angle be what people traditionally liked?</p>
<p>A function of the variation in thickness is to imply direction based off of convention. So, it does look &ldquo;backwards&rdquo; to me. With the &ldquo;W&rdquo; and &ldquo;l&rdquo; repeated, my brain momentarily registered it as a single-word palindrome.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I find that letters must show some inclination. They must tell you, in some way, in what direction your eye should go. When we “revert the contrast”, as we say, thus going against convention, letters seem to tilt to the left, which “sounds” wrong; we know we read from left to right, but the letters are telling us otherwise. I&rsquo;ve thought about things this way, too, and that&rsquo;s where I got. I now use this piece of information whenever I look at or draw any letter.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the main thing that really seems wrong. The rest – different stroke widths, no serifs on top of the lc i or the bottom of the middle lc m leg, the lc e, the lc t, etc. – isn&rsquo;t what we&rsquo;d consider a great, homogenous, coherent and (classicly or not) beautiful design, but it&rsquo;s not throwing the average reader off. The Uc “W”, though, I think might. The lc one, probably not so much.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is not the anti-penlogic that bothers me. It is the awkward angles of the legs which leaves a huge space at bottom center and probably makes the A to W fit very clumsy looking. If you are going to go that way, go further and make the outer strokes much more to wards the upright and make the rest of the glyphs a system to fit. I know the M is often done in this way. It appears to work for the M for some because we are used to it but I think there may be more to it. The weight moves more to bottom both with the traditional M and W&ndash;is this visual gravitation? I don&rsquo;t know but the Romans did something that way for a reason. Perhaps using the V as center, who knows? My guess is that there is some basis beyond traditional habit. Flipping an M for a W can also possibly cause confusion between the two letters. With one with straighter sides, the confusion is minimized.</p>
<p>I can only say that it looks awkward to me beyond the tradition. I think it makes itself look far too different than the rest of the glyphs to make sense as a family or even as a system. It make be more believable as a sans than a roman since roman faces evoke more a traditional expectation. I might like to see all the stroke weight and contrasts flipped to match to see if that helps.</p>
<p>I might add that I don&rsquo;t mind someone trying this kind of solution in the least but I don&rsquo;t think this begins to work yet and could use more time and effort to push it closer to something that works without me having to say, &ldquo;WTF is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, because it derives from a practical constraint, not an arbitrary convention.
However, it could be argued that people more often face North when making maps, so as not to get the sun in their eyes.</p>
<p>BTW, the &ldquo;s&rdquo; is wrongly stressed, from the perspective of chirographic consistency; but it would read Wilmzlow if flipped. The designer didn&rsquo;t push the envelope<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> far.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Or does unusual actually cause you pain because you have to think about it?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Hey, since when is thinking painful?
Maybe I should have put &ldquo;painful&rdquo; in quotes. What I meant was it&rsquo;s uncomfortable; although at the same time I realized it&rsquo;s only really uncomfortable because it&rsquo;s against convention, or what I&rsquo;m used to seeing. But I still couldn&rsquo;t help the effect: My eyes are clearly identifying that as a flipped &ldquo;M&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s pretending to be a &ldquo;W&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;flipping effect&rdquo; is pretty… startling.</p>

<p>In pen rendering the angle used to form the M, W, N  etc is shifted from 30 to 60 degrees to equalize weights in the formation of the letters.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;s&rdquo; is correct, the author just brought the serifs the way of the turn instead of incorporating vertical serifs, this version is out of sync with the rest of the letters, i.e. it is more brush than &ldquo;typographic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, I don&rsquo;t think these modifications add anything positive to this particular design. Average Joe probably wouldn&rsquo;t notice anything unusual. It&rsquo;s like trying to be rebellious by putting a temporary tattoo on your shoulder and wearing long sleeves. There&rsquo;s no meaning or point to it.</p>
<p>For an example of unconventional glyphs that do add meaning see Chester&rsquo;s modification to Galaxie Polaris for the Alliance for Climate Protection (<a href="http://www.wecansolveit.org/)">http://www.wecansolveit.org/)</a>. That is certainly an unconventional w, but it is, in a nutshell, the brand and the message. Which makes it effective. [edited last sentence because it made no sense!]</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm allot of interesting points that I think are inter-related. I&rsquo;m a newbie to type design, I usually listen rather than talk here but it strikes me that what is wrong with this font and indeed is the basis of convention in large areas of design/aesthetics and from what i can see also relates to type, that being nature. Golden ratio, colour theory etc (you all know the list)  breaks down to either biological or instinctive values (such as blue being used for medicine bottles because there is nothing naturally blue that can be consumed without harm, it signifies a warning even to those who have no idea). This font fights how we read (as previously mentioned above), it fights how we write (again previously mentioned above) and the way we do those things derives from our physical nature. Without being able to strongly link terminology most of the conventions it goes against can be clearly drawn back to natural movements, natural rhythms, forms, relationships&hellip; not just in human beings but in everything that grows around us. I think this font strikes us as wrong because it goes against not only how we do things but the natural order around us, but it is still readable, so to the untrained eye it just sits uneasily in the back of the mind, something they might more easily recognize later. Indeed likely successful in some of its aims but not through beauty or grace which would have to contain natural harmony (in itself and the world around) or clear decisive moves that are discordant to make a obvious point (that would have to be highlighted at very least via consistency).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can&rsquo;t comment on the convention, or what the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; are, really.</p>
<p>But it feels wrong. It took some looking at it, and here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve figured out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The W starts with a thin stroke on the left, instead of a thick. I like the thick stroke; In the west we read left to right, so we need some kind of visual key to denote the start of a line, or a sentence. That&rsquo;s why we capitalize. Capitalization of the first letter at the start of a sentence gives us the cue that it&rsquo;s the beginning; Large to small. Likewise, starting with a thin stroke going to thick is a bit bizarre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m also more used to W&rsquo;s where the two outer strokes have more of an incline (or at the very least, the same incline) as the two inside strokes. But I&rsquo;m not sure that this in itself is the issue, but rather that the two contrasting angles are not only different, but just very slightly different. It looks wrong. Most of the time when you create difference in proportion, angle, or form, you exaggerate to make it seem intentional, purposeful. If you don&rsquo;t, it looks like a mistake or an oversight. For example, I don&rsquo;t think the W would look as wrong if the outer strokes were completely vertical, and the inner strokes, by contrast more inclined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It goes without saying there&rsquo;s exceptions to every rule, but it helps to understand a letter&rsquo;s essence, or its guiding principles. This shows a lack of it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">To throw my non-professional two cents in, switching the contrast would, for the way I read, not be practical. The heavy strokes on the W in the above example pull my eyes from the bottom of the letter up, (I believe this has been mentioned more or less) and away from where my eyes want to go, namely, down and to the right. That is the stumbling block to me. Perhaps a switched-contrast display face with a more consistent design would be fun for a title or logo, but I don&rsquo;t think I could get through a page of text with such a font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It seems that the general opinion as far as the logo is concerned is that it is ugly. From that point alone, in my opinion, it shouldn’t have gone to print.
I think that someone found the font and got excited with the unconformity of it. They may have thought that the difference would draw attention; but didn&rsquo;t think why. It is attention grabbing, but only because it is ugly. I thought creating visual treats was the basis of graphic design. Am I wrong?</p>
<p>Randy posted a link above somewhere showing an interesting design using an upside down M as a W. This actually worked within the context of the logo but proves that Unconformity can draw attention looking good.</p>
<p>(Sorry for the length of this I’ll wrap it up now.)</p>
<p>In a Clam shell I think that there should be no creative constraints to typeface or general design. It is the differences that we make that drive design forward. BUT if it doesn’t work visually then you should carry on designing until it dose. This logo obviously didn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;dose this actually look good?&rdquo; Stage in the design.</p>
