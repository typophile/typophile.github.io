  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am trying to research the history and use of stencil fonts, but I am finding that the only references I come across lead me to a particular font.  That is okay, but what I want to know is why and typically where they are used and some examples of their use. 

Is ESPN an example of a stencil font?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting topic to be researching. An educated guess would be that it came out of military life - and marking crates for soldiers to know what each crate contained.

Maybe I watched too much M*A*S*H

Let us know what you find out.

Meanwhile - and example of Stencil Fonts are fonts where the characters are broken up - so they can be "duplicated" onto walls, boxes, etc. You can go to http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=stencil and see commerical stencil fonts or http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=114&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=Type+your+text+here&nb_ppp=50&af=on&psize=m&classt=pop to see shareware/charityware/beerware...
but also take a peek in at House Industires they have at least one very interesting and nice stencil font...(whose name escapes me right now) and several "fun" type stencil fonts.

P.S. If you mean the logo here: http://espn.go.com/ -- I personally, don't consider that a stencil font - it's more of a "techy" font...</div>

And thanks for the suggestions, I was aware of the military aspect, but I was wondering when they became used in sports.

Besides the military uses mentioned, industrial uses of stencils were quite prominent and most likely predated military usage. I grew up in Pittsburgh in the 40s and 50s. I had summer jobs in mills and factories. Stencils were used to mark material for easy retrieval in a warehouse. They were an efficient way to mark numerous crates over and over on all sides so that they can be read from any vantage point. Since 

Pittsburgh was above all an industrial town, It makes sense that the Steelers would follow the lead of the steel industry and give their logo an industrial look.

The United States Steel Corporation also had a stencil logo and the symbol of the Steelers is taken directly from the old Steel Industry symbol.

		<div class="commentbody">It's a little bit funny actually. The wiki doesn't mention the fact that most stencil faces have taken on that look, from laziness. The patterns were originally made to improve hand painting of letters where such expertise was lacking, (Pittsburgh perhaps and the Military most certainly being good examples). After the islands were painted, the "so simple a private can do it" bridges were s'posed to be painted as well to make it look like there was an expert involved.  Oh well ;)

Sometimes, there even are additional completive stencils for filling the bridges; <a href="http://www.atypi.org/05_Brighton/20_main_program/view_presentation_html?presentid=373">Thomas Maier</a> showed some examples of those.</div>

It just shows you what happens to you if you do not receive a proper education....
