  body: "Hi Lizy,\r\n\r\nThe text is set using siFR, which utilizes a combination
    of JavaScript, CSS and Flash to render fonts on screen without the need to have
    the fonts installed on ones system.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\nYou can use any (properly
    licensed,although I am unsure whether or not most EULA's even allow this kind
    of thing) font.\r\nIt is easy as pie.\r\nYou can get crazy with typography on
    the web without using graphics.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nIt uses Flash, therefore Flash
    must be installed on a browser to view it.\r\nIt doesn't support kerning or OT
    features\r\nAlso doesn't support most characters outside of a standard character
    set.\r\n\r\nGrot - putting this in the FAQ is a good idea. I'll work on getting
    it there soon."

  body: "Hey Zara, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask this for a long time. Since my name
    has an accented character, I\u2019ve never seen it on my profile. However sIFR
    supports characters outside the standard set, you just have embed the characters
    in the text field in Flash. So could you embed \xE9 in the future? ;^)"

  body: ahhhh, Grot - you just shined a light on siFR :) I didn't realize I could
    manipulate the embedding, but then again I never use Flash. Looking into it now,
    and hopefully will get that fixed! Thanks :)
