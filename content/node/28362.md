body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've just practically rebuild my home and added a room as my
  workspace. I would like to decorate that room with as much info about type as possible.
  I'm just starting an interest in typography and thought that that would be a nice
  way of learning more about type.\r\n\r\nI've seen many posts here with links to
  other sites where they have pdf's of families and general info or pictures. I would
  like to collect as many as possible to put up the walls and also to have them on
  the computer for research.\r\n\r\nCould anyone please give me some links to interesting
  typographic pdf's or images (high res preferably).\r\n\r\nI found for example some
  on dutchtypelibrary.com, dstype.com, fontshop's fontmag (takes a bit longer then
  a download, but sounds interesting enough), fontfont.com, etc.\r\nI think you know
  what I mean. I will be browsing the forum for the next couple of hours for interesting
  links and downloads.\r\n\r\nI do have a couple of books about type, but I wouldn't
  want to cut pages out of them to hang on the wall, so I'm just looking for free
  downloadable interesting things (I am a student so free things always sounds interesting
  for some reason) =)\r\n\r\nThank you so much! any help will be very very much appreciated!!!\r\n\r\ndav2."
