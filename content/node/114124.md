  body: At first sight, I'd say it would be hard to find a good alternative for the
    entire alphabet (mainly because of /R). I'm also a bit confused about why you're
    after a webfont specifically as you could produce yours from some online generator
    (Fontsquirrel). Anyway, I'd try to gather some alternatives later but for the
    time being would you please tell me what your sample origin is?

title: Hi I am looking for an alternative webfont for this custom made font, in light
  as well as medium/semibold. Sanchez might work but is still a bit playful. thanks
  for your suggestions!
