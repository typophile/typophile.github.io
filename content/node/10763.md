  only I haven&#39;t been doing much. All I&#39;ve done is set their name in a typeface
  that I thought they&#39;d like... is that common? I feel like I&#39;m getting off
  really easy on this one, but, the examples of logos they showed me all looked like
  they&#39;d been done the same way. Here it is : <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7737.gif"

  body: It&#39;s conservative, if that&#39;s the impression the client wants to project.
    It is closer to what I might expect from a law firm. <BR> <BR>Architecture is
    an interesting field to design for &#40;I made some signage for an architect who
    had her office next to Tiro for several years&#41;. On the one hand, architects
    need to project competence and reliability -- to reassure people that their buildings
    will stand up --, which suggests a conservative treatment, but on the other hand
    they need to be seen as creative and innovative. <BR> <BR>What kind of architecture
    does this firm practice? If it is mainly domestic, the appropriate design might
    be quite different from that for a firm that specialises in offices or commercial
    properties. Do they favour particular construction techniques or materials? <BR>
    <BR>Whatever the answer to these questions, I suspect that Minion is a poor choice
    of typeface. I would look for something less common and with more presence. Minion
    is not a bad text typeface &#40;although it is overused&#41;, but it has too little
    character for a logo. Andy Crewdson memorably called Minion &#39;the typeface
    without qualities&#39;. <BR> <BR>Personally, I would be tempted to deconstruct
    the fleuron. You could render it as an outline, in pencil, as an architectural
    plan, perhaps including some guidelines or measurement lines. You could even get
    a bit cubist, and try to combined a plan and elliptical projection of the fleuron
    into a single image. Lots of possibilities.

  body: I would use something other than a fleuron, but similarly understated.  Perhaps
    some sort of geometric or architectural device.  Consider a colour other than
    orange, which doesn&#39;t seem too popular in American identity design. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: I agree completly with John Hudson brief! And Paul comments. <BR> <BR>Perhaps,
    a google search for Architect, could bring some ideas of what make a good Architect
    logo. <BR> <BR>If Minion, seems to bookish, perhaps Trajan for very neo classical
    architects, will work ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>More serious, M

  body: My obsession with architecture has me associating sans serif more with architecture.
    A good architect deals with everything. They create the skeleton as well as the
    skin it supports. STRUCTURE BALANCE   <BR>  <BR>It could be me and it probably
    is, but I&#39;m completely obsessed right now with  everything <a href="http://www.gingkopress.com/_cata/ima1/housc-i.htm"
    target="_blank"> severely modern</a>. &#40;specifically image 3&#41; All that
    can be found/read in <i>Dwell</i> magazine.   <BR>  <BR>However if your firm is
    not so rigid and/or experimental then you could choose a softer sans. Anisette
    Petite caps for instance.  <BR>  <BR>But, definitely not a book publishers face.

  body: 'Of course! Sans-serif! <BR> <BR>About TMA : TMA does both commercial and
    residential architecture, renovation &amp; design.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen logos/company
    names that are in all lower-case and have even heard it argued that a company
    name set in all lower-case is more humble &amp; approachable. I&#39;m wondering
    if you think that approach would work with this, where the company&#39;s name
    is also a persons name... has this rule been broken? Could I break it anyway?
    I&#39;ll admit that my reason for wanting all lower-case is that I like the way
    it looks. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the latest : <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7765.gif"

  body: I think the symbolism of the high ascenders is nice, but the weight&#39;s
    too thin. <BR>For some reason I&#39;m thinking cigarettes. <BR> <BR>And could
    you make the &#34;g&#34; fit in the x-height? Or maybe uppercase it - in which
    case you might do that for a few other letters too &#40;like the &#34;a&#34;,
    since it&#39;s the only [other] one facing left&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    not helvetica, please&#41;. <BR> <BR>about setting the logo in lc, i think in
    this case &#40;architecture firm&#41;, the uppercase would be more appropriate.
    you know, we only use caps for architectural drawings. <BR> <BR>i think you could
    drop any &#34;symbol&#34; too &#40;as the fleuron in your first suggestion&#41;
    and work only with type. <BR> <BR>btw, tadao ando rocks.'
