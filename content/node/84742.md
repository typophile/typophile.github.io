body: So sorry if this has already been covered, I did do a search but couldn't find
  anything. Earlier this year you very kindly identified a font for me (Nyala) and
  I downloaded it and all was well. Since then I've had to do a complete operating
  system re-install so I need to download it again. I can't for the life of me find
  it anywhere that's a free download for a Mac. I'm also looking for Olive Oil. Does
  anyone have any ideas?

    not have any of those, you can licence it from microsoft:\r\nhttp://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/nyala-ethiopic.aspx"
