  at the serif on the right-hand leg of the 'R' in the sample and compare it to if
  you type in 'R' under the \"Try Font\" tab, it seems like the latter serif is truncated.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
  the serif for 'R' here is truncated (go to 'Character Set'):\r\nhttp://catalog.monotypeimaging.com/font/monotype-imaging-yearbook-outline/\r\n\r\nBut
  not here (have to go to 'Character Map'):\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/160387/yearbookoutline-font.html\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know why this is?  It is confusing to me since these sites are all owned
  by Monotype Imaging."

  body: I don't see the effect you describe on my monitor (iMac). It may simply be
    an artefact of how the font renders on your screen, especially at small sizes.

    like a glitch on the server-side."

  body: So, what's the problem? If you prefer the Linotype version, buy it. Then,
    if it turns out to be different from what was promised, return it.

    it is probably a glitch then."
