  body: I always think of the venerable Marydale when trying to ID handwriting scripts.
    Alas, it doesn&#39;t match the font in question. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typequarry.com/type.html?sku=016&amp;cart=10868267713781270"

  body: Thanks for the link. And, um, yes, I see what you mean about jpg.  <BR>Marydale
    has been working for me, but the double-decker a&#39;s remind me of handwriting
    belonging to someone I know who isn&#39;t always friendly. This mystery font has
    good associations. So, anyone? Please, please, please.  <BR>N <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37995.jpg"

    there&#39;re so many of them. Sorry Nola. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
