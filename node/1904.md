  <BR> <BR>I started rebranding my mum&#39;s shop - Elizabeth Horne - which sells
  quality women&#39;s clothes. The town has a very strong Deco heritage, so I used
  that as a starting <BR>point. It ended becoming an entire face. So here is  <BR>some
  character samples, and the promotional poster. <BR> <BR>Critique away! <BR> <BR>

    open compared to the caps. Make them narrow, and less contrast between ascenders/descenders
    and the xheight, bit like Georgia if you follow me. <BR> <BR>And the spacing of
    the caps is a bit narrow for such typical combinations HHHH

    so strong, that given the probable use of this font more would enhance it.  <BR>
    <BR>You might consider making a shorter J - more on the order of the tail of the
    Q the standard, and the long descender an alternate. Also should the foot of the
    L be a little shorter for spacing purposes? <BR> <BR>In this installment of daidala:

    <BR>Jon Coltz interviews Jonathan Hoefler, and if I remember rightly, here Hoefler
    he says some interesting things about an all upper case font vs one with lower
    case. This might interest you as you consider where to take this.   <BR> <BR>'

    with its high cross bar and the shape of the curved foot. What about a traditional
    angular form with that little upswing you show at the L? And if so, would that
    detail look good on the standard Z as well?

  body: Kris, I guess what J-F means is, if you are going to create the oldstyle figures,
    you should have the lowercase characters. Or, you should have an &#34;idea&#34;
    of the x-height, at least.  <BR> <BR>The way it is, your typeface looks like an
    <i>&#34;all-lowercase&#34;</i> alphabet, not an all-caps one. <BR> <BR>For example.
    In most type families, both oldstyle and lining versions of &#34;6&#34; and &#34;8&#34;
    will have the same height. Which is usually something very close to the caps-height.
    In your sample, the oldstyle &#34;8&#34; is taller/bigger than the lining &#34;8&#34;.
    That&#39;s why &#34;they don&#39;t seem to be on same size.&#34; <BR> <BR>Hope
    this can help you. :-&#41;

    <BR> <BR>Arguably against the wishes of Carter, and certainly against those of
    many sensitive users. <BR> <BR>As far as I&#39;m concerned, hybrid numerals &#40;as
    they&#39;re generally called&#41; are superior to both lining and &#34;traditional&#34;
    old-style for running text, except for fonts with very large x-heights, which
    are unusable for long text anyway. Lining numerals are horsey, while traditional
    old-styles are pedantic and less legible. <BR> <BR>BTW, it&#39;s not so &#34;experimental&#34;
    - hybrid numerals are actually becoming more common, although still pretty rare.
    As for their age, some people say Richard Austin &#40;a really dead guy&#41; pioneered
    them. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
