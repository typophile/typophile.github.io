  body: Constantin, <BR> <BR>I would like to be able to help but clearly this is not
    my area of expertise. John Downer in Iowa is the expert in this field. Rod MacDonald
    in Toronto also, but neither seem to make any appearances in the Forum. <BR> <BR>Hopefully
    someone else has some suggestions. <BR>

  body: There&#39;s a brilliant book called Signcraft which was published in 1984
    very good on practical advice for setting out, gilding, equipment etc. unfortunately
    a lot of sign writing skills are dying out since the advent of computerised letter
    cutting. The Origin of the Serif is another great book on brush formed lettering.

  body: Ian <BR> <BR>I think your recommendation of the book &#34;Handlettering Basics&#34;
    is a sound one, and besides it is essential to have a bald head before one can
    hand letter properly. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer

    so maybe it&#39;s a hidden message? I rather like the tie and the braces holding
