    Grotesk</a> with improper apostrophes. Unless you're sending your resume to Berthold,
    you could get by with Helvetica instead.

  body: "Hell, I even design the typefaces to be used on my resume Cheryl! That's
    how good I am!\r\n\r\nBut seriously, I must admit I was pretty clueless for many
    years after I had left college, and it's only now that I'm no spring chicken any
    longer that I feel I know what I'm doing.\r\n\r\nYou should see some of the crap
    I churned out when working on Prima magazine (yes! knitting patterns, bake your
    own advent scene, etc \u2013 that Prima) Or maybe not.\r\n\r\nThe above comment
    was just a slight dig at people who use Typophile as a resource for 'I can't be
    bothered thinking of anything \u2013 I'll let some other sucker do it for me,
    and just copy what they do'.\r\n\r\nSorry if you were offended. It's not bad to
    seek inspiartion. Plagiarism is the bad thing.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
