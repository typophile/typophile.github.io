body: I have just redesigned my design site, http://www.iskradesign.com, with a comprehensive
  portfolio of custom letterforms, icons and calligraphic illustration. Linked to
  it is the blog http://www.alphabetroadtrip.com where I will be posting found letters,
  my newest work, images and stories of signs I like and  essays about letterforms.
  I hope you will take a look![img:sites/default/files/old-images/JournalFragment_5299.jpg]
