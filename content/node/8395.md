body: 'Please give me some criticism here! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m graduating an undergrad
  design program this year and we &#40;the senior design students&#41; are putting
  on a senior portfolio show.  The concept involves how writing about design issues
  &#40;in books like Looking Closer, and sites like Design Observer&#41; are finally
  affecting the academic student level.  We want to celebrate what these writers have
  done in helping us think about design in a more socially conscious way, a more intelligent
  way.  We are having Richard Buchanan &#40;editor of Design Issues Journal, MIT Press&#41;
  come to speak. <BR> <BR>So, since I sort of put together and presented this concept
  to the other students, they put me in charge of the identity for the show.  This
  is going to need to be a mark adaptable to posters, fliers, web, banners, and a
  book cover for a book we are producing to sell at the show. <BR> <BR>We are calling
  the show &#34;Critical&#34;, because these things discussed by design writers are
  all critical issues...but we couldn&#39;t focus it down to one critical idea.  So
  to comprimise we decided to try to make a logo that encompasses a broad scope of
  what design writing discusses. <BR> <BR>Anyway...here are some directions...I&#39;ll
  quit talking. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56814.gif"
  alt="This is the most recent idea. More &#39;all encompasing&#39;"> <BR> <BR>Above:
  My most recent idea.  More &#39;all encompassing&#39;.  It is very large, and I&#39;m
  not sure what might be a good way to deal with that, but on smaller media we could
  just hint at portions of it, and finally on the book use the whole thing. I think
  i like how that effect might work. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56815.gif"
  alt="Something like this would allow us to highlight certain &#39;critical&#39;
  aspects depending on where they&#39;re used.  We might do &#39;Critical: Influence&#39;

  dont&#39; think its all that attractive though."> <BR> <BR>Something like this would

  body: The second seems more capable of mutating and changing to suit needs. You
    could make an interactive &#40;or simply rich media&#41; display and have the
    words rotating and changing as if they are on a wheel. &#40;?&#41;

  body: Yeah, I&#39;m glad you picked up on a wheel or rotation on the second one...that
    was the plan. <BR> <BR>I tried putting some sort of dial or hand &#40;like on
    a compass or clock&#41; on the first to point to and highlight different ideas,
    and it actually looked pretty good.  I just thought it looked too much like a
    clock or compass, and led the concept astray a bit. <BR> <BR>Any ideas on making
    the first one a little more adaptable?

  body: 'JT: <BR> <BR>The first design is a nice concept for a book cover, or other
    applications that would permit such a large image. Maybe you could create a horizontal
    oblong oval shape to replace the circular shape. The oval could hug the &#34;Critical&#34;
    type a little more, overcoming many of the spacial issues. On large applications
    you could include the surrounding words and on small applications you could remove
    them. That&#39;s just one idea. I think there are a myriad of different ways  you
    could morph the background for different applications, such as leaving it as is,
    but cropping it around the &#34;Critical&#34; word, creating a rectangle or some
    other shape. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

  body: I think the first is prettier, but the second, much more prectical in terms
    of being able to carry out the concept physically.

  body: I prefer the first, even though the second is definitely safer and probably
    easier to work with. The second one feels like solutions I&#39;ve seen before
    &#40;and not just Office:mac&#41;. The critical circle doesn&#39;t need to be
    the logo. It could be a central image that is echoed either partially or completely
    in other pieces. The cocentric circles will fall apart at small sizes and on screen,
    but you probably don&#39;t need so many, or so many every time. The logo/small
    print version could be &#39;Critical&#39; in a solid red dot &#40;perhaps with
    small radiating rules&#41;. <BR> <BR>I have a tendency towards difficult logos,
    so keep that in mind. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I went to CMU when Dick Buchanan was the
    head of the design school. He&#39;s a very interesting speaker. <i>Very</i> concept/thinking
    oriented. Can I ask where he&#39;ll be speaking?
