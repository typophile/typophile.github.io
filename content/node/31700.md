    typically adjacent to numerals (e.g.: math operators, currency symbols, space,
    decimal points) should be a matching width so they won't disrupt the grid and
    throw the tabulation out of whack.\r\n\r\nDecimal points are a special case, since
    they are different characters depending on region and language, so some sort of
    contextual substitution would be in order for the comma, period, and space when
    adjacent to tabular figures as opposed to letters. Likewise for parentheses, brackets,
    and braces."

    I see... Nick are you talking about monowidths in a regular font to support financial
    statement etc huh? Actually I should have understood that immediately because
    I have been modifying fonts for use in annual reports this last week. And the
    fact that the fonts they chose had standard widths in many cases made the job
    I was doing far far easier. And the comma and period were half spaces which I
    see now is clever too. I can't comment on vulgar fractions or mathematical operators.
    They didn't require them so I didn't look. And I had no samples of their use either.
    I look foreward to learning more when somebody who knows more than I chimes in!"

  body: "If this is about tabular setting, some other considerations. I sometimes
    make up a comma.tab and a period.tab, not so much for their width but so they
    center better with the numbers -- so the comma or period in 0,000 or 0.000 is
    a bit closer to the left digit than to the right. Never set financial statements,
    but I guess if I did, number-sized monetary symbols would be a plus.\r\n\r\nIn
    an OpenType font, I put in all the fixed spaces from Unicode 2002 through 200B.
    One of those is a \"figure space\" one a \"punctuation space,\" which I've always
    taken to be used for a period or comma in tabular setting -- fits with the Unicode
    description. There are lots of other spaces there, and designing elements for
    tables to one of the sizes shouldn't be too hard. This give you lots of ways to
    \"pad\" a table entry to keep decimal alignment.\r\n\r\nWhen you write the features
    for tnum, just include the other glyphs you've made up for tabular setting."

    text.</cite>\r\n\r\nI'm not an engineer, but I too can test out of Insufferable
    Arrogance 101. So if people can't find the right figures for text setting, the
    text will look bad in any case. And it should be pretty easy to notice you have
    the wrong set even without any numbers, since the periods & commas won't be kerned
    -- \"cap-P\" + \"comma\" would be a clear indication. But I can't test out of
    AI 202, so I suppose if you want to protect your customers you could not include
    such things, at the expense of the tables being harder to set & not looking as
    good. You could also make a determination of which font's aren't likely to be
    used for tabular setting & not include either tabular numbers or any \"extras\"
    in them. Risky, I suppose.\r\n\r\n<cite>Also, if a font contains spaces of different
    width, or half-tab-width period and comma, how should the user see which is which
    since e.g. InDesign\u2019s glyph palette shows the glyph shape but not the according
    space, and in case of spaces, empty cells.</cite>\r\n\r\nSome of the spaces are
    accessible through \"Insert Special Character.\" For the others, you can enter
    a character by its Unicode number from the keyboard. Ah, it was all so much easier
    before WYSIWYG.\r\n\r\nedit --\r\n\r\nI forgot to add, that my way of helping
    to ensure the wrong figures aren't used in text is to assign the name \"one\"
    (& it's Unicode value) to the figure style I want to be default. Usually that
    is the \"oldstyle proportional,\" but if lining, it will be lining proportional.
    Features definitions are written accordingly. Of course, I only work on fonts
    for our small business, so that may not be a generally acceptable notion."

    made up for tabular setting.</em>\r\n\r\nThat's a clever idea, and it works for
    you Charles, but as Karsten points out, not if the default font is tabular, which
    is pretty much a standard, as it's what Adobe does for its revivals of classic
    text faces Garamond, Caslon, and Jenson. \r\n\r\n<em>If you\u2019re going to have

    out of whack.</em>\r\n\r\nI don't think it does stand to reason. In theory, perhaps,
    but I'd like specific real-world examples. I've set a lot of different kinds of
    documents, and never needed adjacent characters to be the same width as figures.\r\n\r\nNow,
    as a type designer, I see no reason to cram monetary symbols and math operators
    into narrow figure spaces.\r\n\r\nIMO, monetary symbols and math operators should
    look good in U&lc setting, as this is where they usually appear. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI
    don't believe that the \"hard space\" model of arranging typographic space that
    was used in metal days, with en quads etc., is relevant in the digital realm,
    where tabs are set to infinitely-adjustable x-axis co-ordinates, and specific
    characters (eg decimal point) may be aligned -- right, left, or centred -- to
    those points."

    out of a DOS box on Windows XP). You would set up to align left, right, or center,
    whichever was easier for a particular table column. Of course with TeX you could
    add any space value you wanted on the fly, but it was usually a few predictable
    characters, most of which have been mentioned.\r\n\r\nWith uni2002-uni200B, you
    get (in units) 1000, 500, 333, 250, 166, a figure space (make it the width of
    a tabular figure for each font), a punctuation space (again make if for each font),
    200, and 55 (a hair space for me). In metal, that's an em, en, thick, mid, thin,
    hair, & a couple more. Surely you can cram your non-numerical tabular glyphs into
    one of those.\r\n\r\nIf you are making a font you are selling/distributing, what
    does it matter what Adobe puts in <cite>their</cite> fonts? You'd be better off
    to put in the proportional set of figures. And consider this: if you kern the
    period or comma with the 7 (for example) as would be normal in text, you will
    lose decimal alignment in any table using 7,407.62 -- if you make your tabular
    figures the default, you can't have any kerning with them, right?"

    comes with a group of bundled Adobe OT fonts, which are the de facto standard.\r\nIf
    my fonts behave differently than Adobe's, people will think there's something
    wrong with them.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this: Last year I designed some custom fonts
    for a newspaper, with proportional figures as default. A few months later they
    contacted me, asking if I could provide an alternate font with figures for use
    in tabular settings. So I explained that all the fonts I had supplied, which were
    OpenType, already had that feature, all they had to do was select it from the
    OT menu. \r\n\r\n<em>if you kern the period or comma with the 7 (for example)

    figures, then they get the kerning.\r\n\r\n<em>Surely you can cram your non-numerical
    tabular glyphs into one of those.</em>\r\n\r\nBut why bother? Digital typographers
    position type at a tab position by entering a numerical tab value in the layout
    application, not by filling up the space between the left margin and the tab position
    by quads and spaces.\r\n\r\nCharles, in what circumstances do you use all those
    unicode spaces you customize your fonts with? Examples please! \r\n\r\nAnd no,
    those values don't work out for \"non-numerical tabular\" glyphs: if the figures
    are 500, then the $ fits that OK, but Sterling and Euro will be 600 (more for
    a \"proper\" Euro). Mathematical operators, I find, need a bit of space built
    in, so around 700 is good.  \r\n\r\n"
