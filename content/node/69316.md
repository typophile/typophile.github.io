  first post, so be nice!! hehe\r\n\r\nMy typography teacher wants us to do a type
  catalog about any typography subject. I chosed lettering and I divide it this way:
  \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>[manual lettering] before computer age (I know a spanish letterer
  called [[http://www.neufville.com/Designer/RICROUS_.htm|Ricardo Russelot]] but I
  can't find any info, I guess I'll just contact him)</li>\r\n<li>[computer age] before
  open type (I don't know any authors here... could be some emigre's fonts?)</li>\r\n<li>[computer
  age] after open type (underware, sudtipos, house industries?)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI
  don't even know if this would be a good way to make the catalog sections. But this
  is not the main problem. The main problem is that I'm having a hard time finding
  info about lettering as I don't want to put so much info about the historical starting
  of writting, the romans, italics and so... I want to start more like about 1600-1700
  or so, where people started making letterings for shops and so on.\r\n\r\nSo, to
  sum it up, I just need to know if you guys think I'm going the right way on this,
  and if you could give me any links/names of authors/names of books where I can get
  the info I need for the catalog (mainly text and images).\r\n\r\nThank you!!"

    became type? For the 20th century there is always Hermann Zapf. Any book on the
    history of writing should get you names of scribes. Or try wikopedia.\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Arrighi\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Manutius"

  body: 'I''m not looking for scribes as the old book calligraphy writters, more like
    famous designers who made logotypes drawing typography, sineage for shops and
    so on. So I guess it would have to be more like from 1800''s to 1950''s or something
    like this (in the manual lettering section). '

  body: Also, the second section (computer calligraphic typography but w/o open type
    [80's-2000's?]), I only know emigre (and I'm not even sure they did make calligraphic
    types, because in their website there ain't any), any more authors or books would
    be welcome too :)

  body: 'There is a lot of lettering for advertising, packaging, signage that is difficult
    to attribute, meaning the lettering artists are anonymous. Much advertising lettering
    of the 20th century was done by experts with long careers, but who never had a
    presence beyond their work. The House Industries guys are very avid students of
    hand-lettering styles and the craftspeople who practiced hand-lettering; if you
    contact them, you might get some useful leads. They have already done a lot of
    research to discover the identities of otherwise forgotten lettering artists. '

    people who made lettering/calligraphic fonts but without using open type\r\n\r\nThanks!!"
