  in that case.\r\n\r\nHi all.\r\n\r\nMy name is Ted Damion and I'm a member of a
  local club. During our meetings we talk most of the time about advertising and design.
  We are going to get a bit bigger (4 persons right now) and I came up with the suggestion
  to make us a logotype. \r\n\r\nThe one who started the club is a new member of this
  community. He tried ones to design the logotype and ask members here for help. But
  it didn't went very well.\r\n\r\nAs we're all students in the club we don't have
  much money, and none of the other members are willing to spend money to get this
  done. So I smashed my piggy bank and found 20 dollars which I'm using to this task.\r\n\r\nI
  don't have a credit card so I'll give the money to our chairman who will transfer
  the money via PayPal or something similar.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, please post
  your email address here or email me at: illogical_squirrel@yahoo.se\r\n\r\nI will
  give you all the facts about the club via email, if that's okay. \r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot.\r\n\r\nTed Damion"

    logo design for most of the members here starts at at least 10 times what you
    are offering.

    a quarter. It's more insulting than just not tipping at all. ;)\r\n\r\nInstead,
    post what you got. Folks in here would be glad to help you with advice/suggestions
    to guide you in the right direction."
