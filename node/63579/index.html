  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi, I absolutely have no clue about typography. I&rsquo;ve been lurking here and there ([[http://ilovetypography.com/|itc]]) trying to pick up what I can but one wall that I keep bumping into that I feel never really gets elaborated upon is finding out how, where, &amp; when a particular font is best used for.</p>
<p>Plenty of times I&rsquo;ve seen typophiles say on the subject of choosing a font is to choose depending on content and audience. What does that mean - what kinds of content &amp; audiences are there? More importantly, how or where do you find this info?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also read a lot about overused fonts (Helvetica, Arial, and Times) being bastardized because it&rsquo;s used in the wrong setting. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what that means but I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s about the medium, that some fonts are designed or best used for screen but it may not exactly look as great when in print or in a sign. How does one find out what mediums a font was designed for? And what mediums would a font still work well at?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also read that some fonts only work for certain sizes. That fonts are designed for a particular size(s)? Furthermore, there may also be other things to consider like font penetration on devices &amp; similar-looking fonts to fall back on, or lacking support on foreign/squiggly characters (not sure what the term is!), etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing most of the answers will point toward using ones eyes. But for one who doesn&rsquo;t know what to look for (me) it will be a futile exercise. So I ask you folks here if you could share some your expertise and guidelines on using a particular font, if this doesn&rsquo;t exists already. Maybe something like this:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Font Name:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Superfont
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Designed Medium:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Screen
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Works Still on:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Projections
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Designed Size:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 16px
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Works at Size Range:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 12px &ndash; 32px
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pros:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 95% of net devices have this font
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cons:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Overused, generic.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Other:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Looks good in headers and in paragraphs. Lacks small caps and bold italic version. Interesting history, superman actually designed this!
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Example was pulled out of my arse)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now I know the danger of a cookie-cutter approach to anything but in most cases I believe it would serve as an invaluable learning tool for beginners. If not, at the very least, people like me could avoid misusing a font everywhere and on anything. :)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was going to say either &ldquo;Welcome to hell&rdquo; or &ldquo;There is no spoon,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m settling on &ldquo;Welcome to Typophile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your questions are thoughtful and intelligent for someone with no background in type. Unfortunately, though, your request is elephantine. It&rsquo;s almost 1:00 a.m. where I am, and I have to work in the morning, so I&rsquo;m not going to get too into this, but here&rsquo;s a little to get you started&hellip;</p>
<p>Just like in any craft, there are rules of varying importance and weight in typography .</p>
<p>[Quick sidebar clarification: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->typography<!-- raw HTML omitted --> refers to the functional/aesthetic setting of type; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->type design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is not necessarily typography. Rather, it is the design of the letterforms and alphabets used by typographers. Not many typographers can masterfully design type, and vice versa (but before the sensitive crowd gets too upset, I fully acknowledge there are some serious exceptions to that statement). I&rsquo;m replying to your post more from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->typographer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> angle, as my knowledge of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->type design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is limited.]</p>
<p>Depending on the abilities of two, say, typographers with the same skill set put to the same task with the same set of tools (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->e.g.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, software and fonts), they may construct pages that are markedly different from one another in style and feel, yet both function exactly as they need to (or, more frequently, not at all).</p>
<p>Why? Admittedly general, and in no particular order:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personality<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
(That is, the personality of the typographer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the typeface(s) used on the project) A typographer may personally be more comfortable with a certain face for a kind of project. Anyone who has an opinion about &ldquo;fonts&rdquo; can relate to some more than others, and may thus lay out a page using something they are comfortable with. Which leads us to:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The right tool for the job<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
There&rsquo;s a reason United States IRS documents are composed in Helvetica and not in the &ldquo;Chiller&rdquo; font. So, if Helvetica is the perfect banal and transparent face for government documents, why is it so elegant and contemporary for branding such as Crate&amp;Barrel or edgy and cool for American Apparel? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->See the movie<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the answer.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Family History<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Various faces fall into different categories: there are genres and sub-genres and Return of the Son ofs (Reference? Anyone?) for serifs, sans, displays, texts, scripts, and on and on. Each has its developmental place historically, and thus has a &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; application, for various reasons (see &ldquo;The right tool for the job,&rdquo; above).</p>
<p>To make matters worse (better), a masterful typographer might be able to justify (no pun intended) using an historically inappropriate face for a job, and make it work beautifully (see &ldquo;Personality,&rdquo; above).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Variable Interdependence<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
As you can see by my few and scattered examples, these factors can interdepend on one another, and there are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->way too many<!-- raw HTML omitted --> more variables for me to discuss here or now.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I understand what you&rsquo;re looking for, and I know that I didn&rsquo;t give it to you, but I hope you might have a better understanding as to why yours is a difficult request.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Resources<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
There&rsquo;s more than a handful of fantastic books on typography, and I&rsquo;m sure others will provide you with links galore, but here are some resources for completely backgroundless newbies:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thinking with Type<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Ellen Lupton
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Type Desk Reference<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, brand new publication, by Theo Rosendorf
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thinking in Type<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Alex White</p>
<p>I love these books. Lastly, I hesitate to mention (and to not mention) a profound contribution to the contemporary type community. Despite it&rsquo;s ironically appalling cover, Robert Bringhurst&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elements of Typographic Style<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is considered by most to be the typographer&rsquo;s bible. My hesitation is only because you&rsquo;re a newbie. If you catch the bug, and I think you might, then get this book. It&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>Aw, hell. I guess I&rsquo;ll give it a shot for one of my own favorites:
Font Name: Scala Sans
Designed Medium: Screen (that&rsquo;s kind of an odd wording, but I think you mean &ldquo;designed on a computer vs. lead vs. wood, etc)
Works Still on: Projections (I don&rsquo;t even know what that means)
Designed Size: ?
Works at Size Range: Very dynamic. I have successfully set this at 5 points for &ldquo;the fine print,&rdquo; and I once saw it breathtakingly set in a banner in Hartford that covered the side of an enormous office building (considerably larger than a billboard). Awesome.
Pros: Clean, fresh, readable, all the stuff you&rsquo;d demand (small caps, multiple weights, etc); OpenType version has sc, expert, math, ornaments, and more built in (as it should, but so should deGroot&rsquo;s Thesis by now).
Cons: I&rsquo;m sure there must be some&hellip;
Other: It&rsquo;s late. I have to go sleep now. Good luck, and welcome to Typophile.</p>

<p>For an absolute beginner (one with your questions, at least), I would recommend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stop Stealing Sheep and Find Out How Type Works<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Erik Spiekermann and E.M. Ginger. Personally, I prefer the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1st edition<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but there is also a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2nd edition<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I also recommend <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Designing with Type<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by James Craig (now in its 5th edition). Also available from James Craig: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Basic Typography: A Design Manual<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I would start with one of these books&hellip; And then, if you get bitten by the type bug, move on to the ones by Lupton, Rosendorf, and White. :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello, Lisle. Welcome to Typophile.</p>
<p>The first step into type is realizing how little you know, so that&rsquo;s out of the way. As a graphic design student, I was struck by this realization around my junior year. Lurking here is good, but it can be a bit dense. There are some general guidelines, but the devil is in the details (along with god, I&rsquo;m told), so reading up is the best bet.</p>
<p>Books will give you a good foundation, particularly for use and an overview. Ricardo&rsquo;s recommendations match my own. When you&rsquo;re ready for the next level, we&rsquo;ll still be here. Also, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->start learning type history:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> what typefaces were popular during which eras and how they fit into the philosophy that drove their designs. The era contributes the &ldquo;voice&rdquo; of a typeface, because our popular culture often has a visual understanding of something before an intellectual one. You can evoke a time period or emotional response simply by choosing an archetypal typeface. The philosophies that drove their designs are often based in function or emotion, which is a good way to match type to subject matter (though not always). This is also a great way to find a typeface that defies convention and breaks expectations (see Avant Garde&rsquo;s recent revival).</p>
<p>I find the most informative sources are the font makers/sellers themselves, once you&rsquo;ve read the basics. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do a good job of giving context and usage info on their releases. FontShop (by way of the ubiquitous Stephen Coles) has a great <!-- raw HTML omitted -->newsletter they send out<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that often contains concise and helpful descriptions of their releases.</p>
<p>The arguably best way to figure out what works and what doesn&rsquo;t is to start typesetting everything you make. Try a different typeface. Combine two for heads and body then take a look. Listen to others' reactions. Tighten the margins. Work with the line spacing. Then change the typeface again and see what it does in the same setting. Type is tricky because there are different realms with different goals. Identifying your overall goal will help. If you&rsquo;re typesetting lengthy running text in a novel, your goals are very different from an advertisement or a business proposal.</p>
<p>Also, find examples of things you like and really scrutinize the type being used. Try to describe it. How does it differ from what you have available in Word? Use resources like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What the Font<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to start identifying type you enjoy. Look for the colophons in books and learn what typefaces are used by the pros.</p>
<p>In the end, short of going to school, exploration (by doing and reading) is the best route. If you&rsquo;ve lurked Typophile, you know that we rarely agree on things, so while there are general guidelines, it all comes down to judgement and experience.</p>

<p>My preference has to do with the design, basically. I only own the first edition, and when I leafed through the second one, it seemed to me that the design of the pages had become very busy and even distracting. (This came up before on Typophile, and someone said that even the design of the first edition seemed busy to him! Wish I could find that thread now.) On the other hand, I haven&rsquo;t read the second edition &ndash; maybe it&rsquo;s time that I gave it a chance. :-)</p>
