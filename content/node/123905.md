body: "Hello everybody,\r\nRight now I'm designing an academic online magazine, and
  I'm looking for \r\n1) an Arabic font to pair with Gill Sans for headlines (light)
  and sub-heads (reg)\r\n2) an Arabic font to pair with a humanist serif like Scala
  (it must be a font that supports Greek) in the long copy.\r\n\r\nI've been doing
  some research, and came across some stuff that I liked, but I know really only a
  little bit about Arabic typography (I'm really not a typography specialist anyway),
  so I thought I'd try to get some professional's opinion (besides my partner's, whom
  I'll pester with my questions tonight, too). \r\nI especially enjoyed reading this
  discussion: http://typophile.com/node/92658\r\nSince the academic project is about
  research in different medieval cultures, I definitely want to avoid a \"latinized\"
  Arabic font by all means.\r\n\r\nI started out with the Quadraat \u2013 which I
  love \u2013 for the logo and headlines (sans) and long copy (serif), and the client
  liked it for the long copy, but settled for the Gill as headline font \u2013 which
  is also fine with me. \r\nThen it turned out that they'll have Greek and Arabic
  words in headlines and text every now and then, so I have to change the text font
  as well to support Greek. I think Scala will do fine \u2013 it's long texts that
  will be read online as well as printed out on desktop printers.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?
  Also, if you have any other suggestions for the Latin fonts, I'm open to that as
  well.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

    Arabic typeface. If I were commissioned to the task I would choose myriad arabic.
    In my opinion it's the only one which is drawn respectfully to the arabic script
    esthetics. You might say that Gill sans is a geometric design compared to myriad
    but I can't really suggest you a better option.\r\n"

    :(\r\nI was looking at some of Pascal Zoghbi's fonts but I guess the Azer is too
    \"playful\" (for the lack of a better word)...\r\nDo you have any suggestions
    for the long copy? Again, I was looking at Pascal's work and thinking of the Seria
    (only for the arabic though, I don't really care for the latin Seria), combined
    with sth like Scala, or the Eskorte or Nassim? Hmmmm, it is so hard!\r\nAre you
    working on fonts right now? I really like the Harir, and the Lava to go with it
    :)\r\n"

  body: 'Azer is too playful (also Seria) I agree. It also depends who is going to
    read it because Persian taste is a bit different form Arabic taste. Jana seems
    latinized to me. For body text these could work: Nassim and Adobe Arabic. Eskorte
    is a bit loud for running text.'

    suggested Noto (Google Fonts), I guess I'll play with the Gill and the Arabic
    Noto and see how it looks...\r\n\r\n"
