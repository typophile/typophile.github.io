  body: Could be wrong but to me it could be decently approximated starting with [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Futura|Futura]]
    mainly the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/t-extra-bold-condensed|Condensed
    Extrabold]] style (from URW here as example).

  body: "Good call Dick. Looks closer to me. Second time for me I have to deal with
    Graphicus DT. It looks so close to Paul Renner's Futura. \r\nSome of the noticeable
    differences gathered from a [[http://typophile.com/node/42340#comment-265882|previous
    discussion]] on the topic:\r\n<blockquote>Graphicus DT appears very similar to
    Futura; it seems to be a tad wider and the A,M,W are flattened on the top and
    bottom whereas in Futura they have points. Also, the j has a slight curve at the
    bottom instead of just a straight line, and the descender on the g is less harshly
    geometric and more open. Print Clearly is narrower than Futura and appears to
    have a rounded stroke. Also, the I, J, and 1 have serifs to make them more distinguishable.</blockquote>"
