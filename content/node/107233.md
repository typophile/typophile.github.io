body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a bizarre client who wants a new type family to use across
  all communications. She likes futura but doesn't want to use it, she wants something
  like futura. She's a strange lady. \r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend a family with range
  of weights, all with italics and condensed & bold condensed for display? It's a
  big client so budget isn't a problem.\r\n\r\nI like Super Grotesk but no italics
  unfortunately!\r\n\r\nLove to hear some ideas."

    an idea of far I'd consider moving away from Futura
