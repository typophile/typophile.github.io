  lost any objectivity. I would appreciate any advice, recommendations\r\nor constructive
  criticism because basically I can't tell anymore if it's alright or complete crap.\r\n\r\nP.S.
  It's for a interactive studio and the typeface is modified PMN Caecila\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logotype_4042.jpg]"

  body: If you pull the design element closer to Wolfpack it makes a better unit.
    Otherwise go for it.

  body: I would try and drag the element a tiny bit more to the left for a slightly
    better optical balance (this might be like that only when viewed on a screen).

  body: Very nice typography! I do agree with Robert and Tina (above), and I also
    find the picto to be a touch too big for the package. But I'm sure you've fought
    with the proportions in your sleep, so do what you and the client like best. Nice
    work!

  body: "The type works great, IMHO.\r\n\r\nThe mark, while slick, seems purely decorative
    and arbitrary and I'd argue isn't really needed at all. Since this is for a design
    studio, I'd suggest dropping the mark all together. It keeps the type pure and
    prevents your own logo from competing with your actual work in the portfolio."

  body: "I agree with aluminum, I like them independently, but not necessarily together.
    They are very different in feel: the mark seems fluid and decorative and the typography
    is a little \"stiff\" for the mark. Maybe if both pieces used the same type of
    line (either rounded or straight ends) or maybe if you modify the type to flow
    with the mark instead of chopping the ends. \r\nGood luck - I too am fighting
    with a logo but I don't know if I am brave enough to post!"

  body: I like the combination but I think, with others, that the logo needs to nudged
    leftwards so that it "appears" centered. At the moment it feels weighted to the
    right.

  body: "First of all, thanks everyone for your comments, it's great to get some feedback...\r\nIn
    response to some of the posts:\r\n\r\nDan: It does have a meaning behind it, but
    I think your right and it may be far to obscure and overly subtle. The four pieces
    coming together are supposed to represent wolfs, the three lines as claw-marks
    in the shape of a wolf's front leg. Also the star in the negative space relates
    to the Lupus (the wolf) constellation.\r\n\r\nOthers: I think you are right the
    type could probably exist without the mark, and i am looking at going down this
    road, although I am very attached to that symbol :).\r\n \r\nAnother point(probably
    why I'm finding this logo difficult to resolve) is that it's for a personal business
    venture.\r\n\r\nAgain cheers for your feedback.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You say the three lines in the mark represent claw-marks, but when I think
    about claw-marks ik picture raw and powerful lines instead of subtle rounded ones.
    It's like a wolf trying to paint with paint on it's nails. Could be a nice image,
    if that's what you were aiming at. \r\nAlthough i think the mark looks really
    nice and the idea behind it is pretty good, it doesn't really fit the name of
    the studio. But that's my opinion"

  body: "Brainstorming, I think a better image (if you're still considering a logomark)
    would be a wolfpack. I'm envisioning the silhouette of 3 wolves standing proud,
    as if they're looking out over a cliff at their prey. One centered, one angled
    to the right and one angled to the left (off kilter, wolves aren't into symmetry.)\r\n\r\nBut,
    that's just an idea. "

  body: "I also immediately thought that the customized type was done really well,
    and could exist on its own without a problem. But I can imagine you are attached
    to the symbol, because it does look very nice. If you keep 'em both, I would suggest
    closing the gap between the two a little. \r\nTo make the wordmark play the leading
    role, you could also see what happens if you make the symbol smaller. Although
    I can imagine it might indeed get too light compared to the type when you do that.\r\n\r\nOtherwise;
    go for it. It's nice."

  body: "Maybe let the lines grow a bit thicker at the end of the \"paw\"? That would
    support your metaphor a bit. I actually <em>did</em> see some kind of hand/paw
    of some sort, before you mentioned it. I think it's because it reminds of a lot
    of club visuals I've seen in Copenhagen (I couldn't find a picture, sorry)\r\n\u2013

    be a bit too heavy. It wants all the attention, where -- I think -- the wordmark
    should get it.

    I didn't feel that way from your first entry. If you didn't change it, then it's
    just because it's at a smaller size. You may want to consider having a version
    used exclusively for small sizes that uses <cite>slightly</cite> looser tracking,
    for the sake of visual consistency.\r\n\r\nI really like your letter customization."

  body: I'd go without the symbol completely, I think the type is very strong and
    the symbols aren't adding significantly to the identity. If you do go with a symbol
    though, focus on the weight and the width of the positive/negative space in relation
    to the text. Well done.

  body: Pablo, everyone loves the word mark, why are you forcing a logo with it? Even
    you don't sound too sure about them. There's an old saying, "Good Design is the
    balance between Monotony and Self Indulgence." quit while you're ahead, don't
    try to add more than is needed.
