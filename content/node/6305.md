  body: Welcome to the dark, alluring world of &#34;lo-fi&#34; type.  :-&#41; <BR>
    <BR>&#62; our phone directory <BR> <BR>I think the Helvetica thing is pretty dumb,
    but the splicing-in of those Eras &#40;?&#41; numerals is very interesting &#40;if
    stylistically discordant&#41;. Although the slight slant is bad for lo-res rendering,
    and the color is probably too light&#42;, the structures are smart, like in the
    &#34;6&#34;/&#34;9&#34; - it&#39;s certainly better than any grot numerals, where
    the &#34;3&#34;, &#34;6&#34;, &#34;8&#34; and &#34;9&#34; typically all converge.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; What&#39;s the point size? It&#39;s always good to scan up a pica
    rule alongside this stuff. <BR> <BR>BTW, in a phone book font narrowness is critical,
    so something like Adsans wouldn&#39;t work. Retina would be great, although the
    traps might turn out slightly too strong - which they actually do for Retina&#39;s
    target usage, the Wall Street Journal stock listings - my guess is that Tobias
    F-J overdesigned them on purpose, so they could use Retina to good effect in lower-grade
    papers too. But I&#39;d probably never get confirmation of that...  :-/ <BR> <BR><a

  body: Hello. I really like Retina, the letters when enlarged have sections cut out
    - I believe to reduce bleeding when printed. See this link for samples of it used
    larger than the small type and you&#39;ll see... It was used in the Smithonians
    Cooper Hewitt&#39;s National Design Triennial 2003 <BR><a href="http://www.ndm.si.edu/EXHIBITIONS/TRIENNIAL/content/HOEFLER.html"

    <BR> <BR>Also, I believe that the title &#34;National Design Triennial&#34; is
    set in Retina and for those of you that have the annual&#39;s book, look it up
    and check for me?  <BR> <BR>Or you can try, BELL CENTENNIAL. Created by Matthew
    Carter for the phone company Bell Telephone, it also has a nice ability to print
    at small sizes. It has similar anti-bleed charactertistics of Retina, and may
    be slightly easier to purchase/find. <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/121/bellcentennial-family.html#more"
