body: I had this logo done by an artist, and I'd like to use the same font in a website
  banner heading.  I did copyright the logo through the US Copyright Office, and received
  my copyright in the mail.  So, the logo is copyrighted.  Please don't use my logo,
  but I would greatly appreciate if someone identified this font.  It looks sort of
  like a version of Baskerville.  I can't hardly ever get in touch with the artist,
  and when I do, I forget to ask about the font.
