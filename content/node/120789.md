body: Hi there, this isnt really  a font ID request or at least I don't mean it to
  be! Its more of a history question. I am doing a design project for a restaurant
  in Paris and am intrigued by the S in the original 1920s signage. The rest of the
  type is very close to Neutraface, with the E inverted! I think the architect may
  have been a fan of Richard Neutra but am wondering if anyone knows the origin of
  the style of the S or seen similar examples of it on other signage. I would like
  to add some editorial about it to the menu and blog.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6966320303_5dd090a75a_z_3611.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/1790_3_3686.jpg]
