  forum.\r\nNow i joined and I come out with a big request and hope there will be
  some response:\r\n( I try my best in english)\r\n\r\nI am working on a Corporate
  Design for some Architects in Germany. All the basic elements should be in Helvetica
  Uppercase letters. In my opinion Helvetica Majuscules are not the best solution
  for only uppercase lettering. BUT there is nothing to change-it must be Helvetica.
  Architects.....\r\n\r\nBut working with this decision is quite hard for me and a
  lot of \"small\" problems coming out:\r\n\r\n1.The numbers cap-heights are a little
  smaller as the letters. Would you resize the numbers or letters to the same size.
  And If so is there a special metric system useful. \r\n\r\n2. How would you solve
  the problem with these unbelievable ugly brackets?\r\n\r\nThe text should be set
  very \"compact\" , avoiding the normal tracking to produce a good readable text
  in this small size.\r\nBut also avoiding total confusion. What could be the best
  tracking to get this result. In my example I used metrics kerning and tracking 10
  with 5,84 points ( :-( ). What do think about that.\r\nAlways using a bold and a
  regular style. The Logotype is set in heavy and light styles.\r\n\r\nI would be
  really happy getting some tips and feedback from this experts members in this forum.\r\n\r\nregards

  body: "Many recently released sans faces, in the OpenType format, have both lining
    and oldstyle figures.\r\n\r\nThis solves the compromise found in faces of a certain
    age, such as Helvetica, which haven't been upgraded, and only have one set of
    three quarter height figures that are meant to accompany both capitals and lower
    case setting, but aren't perfect for either.\r\n\r\nSome of these new sans faces
    have lining figures that do, in fact, line, at cap height.\r\n\r\nAlso, as part
    of the OpenType feature set, they may have alternate punctuation which automatically
    provides the adjustment Jens mentions, when \"all caps\" is selected--and have
    the option of tabular or proportional widths.\r\n\r\nEven an older face which
    does have lining figures, such as DIN, is, IMO, not quite right for all cap setting,
    because the figures are somewhat condensed in relation to the capitals. Again,
    this is because they are required to work with the lower case as well.\r\n\r\nYou
    should contact FontShop.de--they should be able to help you find something suitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    f.e. Fago is no alternative. Like I wrote it must be Helvetica or a look a like."

  body: "@ Jens:\r\n\r\nThanks a lot. That is exactly what I mean. Scaling the numbers
    should be no problem. But shifting the hyphen and parentheses must be done manually
    in second layer. For the basic elements of the CD it could be done, but if the
    complete font setting should be like this, it would be to much. In case it should
    have been done, are you able to do it? I'm not. An if so, could I contact you?

  body: "For the CD elements, if you work in InDesign, you could use character formats
    with a baseline shift to position the hyphens and parentheses.\r\n\r\nDo I read
    this correctly, you/your customer think about using Helvetica all-caps for everything,
    e.g. letter text, invoices etc.? I think for stationery and the like you could
    get away with an all-caps setting, but for everything, it might be too much and
    be badly readable.\r\n\r\nJens"
