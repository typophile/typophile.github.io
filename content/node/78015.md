body: "I just got through creating a font and when I applied it to a random letter
  I typed in TextEdit (mac) 2 random $ signs appear on the page. They can't be deleted.
  They are not glyphs. They are just stuck there and in fact it's possible to type
  over them and you can see them underneath the letters on top! \r\n\r\nI sometimes
  don't see them and sometimes there are one or two, depending on what you type. Now
  I'm also seeing random - symbols that appear and change when I adjust the type size!\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have any idea what the hell this is or how it can be fixed? God have mercy on the
  font designer that faces this. This is terrible.\r\n\r\nI'd like to sell this font
  eventually and I can't have this glitch in it!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to anyone
  that can help me out."

  body: A bit more information and an image might be helpful. What format is the font
    in? If Open Type is there feature code involved that might have some involvement?
    What software did you use to generate the font? Does it exhibit this behavior
    in any other applications?
