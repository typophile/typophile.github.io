  body: I've built my own classification groups in Font Explorer. Haven't come across
    a system that would do it automatically.

  body: Thanks very much everyone! I've been using Linotype Font Explorer for some
    time now, but I wasn't sure if there were some easier way to sort my fonts than
    going through them manually. I'm going to give FontCase a shot, I'll let everyone
    know how it is for future reference.
