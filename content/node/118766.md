body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThis is my first font ID request, really hoping some of you
  out there are able to help.\r\n\r\nI've found a classic-looking serif font, on the
  cover of an issue of GQ magazine. It's characterised by very circular serifs and
  shapely punctuation.\r\n\r\nProfuse apologies to more experienced typophiles, I'm
  relatively new to describing fonts characteristics. \r\n\r\nAny help given will
  be hugely appreciated. Many thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
