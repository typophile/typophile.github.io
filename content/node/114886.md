    body: Since the company has a low budget and no extreme need for that exact font
      on its website, I was just trying to find out if, among the various services
      and websites offering free and open source fonts, there is something with a
      similar mood to Fago's. Of course I am not going to use Fago on the website
      without paying for it, but I think the company has the right to choose whether
      to use a free font or not. :)

  body: I find these situations to be quite awkward, actually. Of course the company
    has the right to choose whether to use a free font or not, but I also wonder,
    if the company has no money for a one-time fee of 159 euro to establish a good
    brand identity then I have to wonder why you would even want to start up a company
    in the first place. I want my clients to be passionate about the design of their
    company and value it accordingly.

  body: 'I know of three freely-available egyptians that will let them judge for themselves
    the balance between identity and price: Aleo, Arvo and Roboto Slab. There is a
    semi-payware fourth, Museo Slab. All can be found here ([[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/]])
    and all are enough unlike Fago that the difference should be visible even to a
    tunnel-visioned accountant that hasn''t taken his eyes off the bottom line for
    the last fifty years.'
