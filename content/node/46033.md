  body: It is likely a custom font. Nike has been having them made for their ads for
    a while. Still, I could be wrong. You might want to look up plazm fonts and see
    if they did it.

    it's United. Quite expensive :)\r\n\r\nSorry next time I'll search.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    has a cheap alternative to United ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot."

    least the \";-P\" should have inspired you! Use both sides of your brain!\r\n\r\nSPARQ
    <=> SPQR --- they have a very similar \"look\". Nike = Greek godess of Victory
    (Latin Victoria), so merely looking at the thread title alone, I thought SPARQ
    might be a misspelling... So, what modern font would best express the classic
    (ancient) Roman ideal express most?\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"

  body: "\"Any credence to this connection? Perhaps...\"\r\n\r\nI personally believe
    it's more in the line of \"Hm, spark sounds good. Active. Incentive. Yeah, name
    it so. Oh, and spell it with a Q: Sparq, [delete]so that it reads like Iraq[/delete],
    [insert]so that it catches the eye[/insert] and is conformist with new Web 2.0
    naming conventions.\"\r\n\r\nI doubt the Marketing guys of Nike thought of the
    Roman (farfetched, admittedly) connection. I mean, you were the first to get it.
    Is that something specific American, or is it not en vogue to have classical education
    any more in general, a world phenomenon?\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"
