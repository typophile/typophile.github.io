    Grotesk Cond (Bold)]]</strong> is also an exact match except of /R.\r\nThere was
    an old version of Akzidenz Grotesk Condensed Bold with a straight /R leg but I
    can't find it anymore.\r\nYou can try to embolden the Akzidenz Grotesk Condensed
    (not Bold) which still has a straight leg, but I don't know how close it would
    be to your sample."

    body: Thank you so much! That was very helpful! I have to redesign the logo for
      a school project and was wondering if I should stick with the same typeface
      or use something similar...

      this is the closest option!
