body: Hello, i am wondering how can i create a font that would function like standards
  [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] fonts - e.g. Stone IPA or Times. I have
  designed all necessary characters, correctly named them, created a custom FontLab
  encoding file (.enc) - based on Stone IPA, and tried genereting some PostScript
  Type 1 fonts. However the character mapping is different when typing on a Mac. When
  i try e.g. alt-w, i shoudl get reversed w, but i get something else instead. Does
  anyone has experience with phonetic fonts? How shoudl them be generated on a Mac?
  Any advice is greatly appreciated.

    <BR> <BR>Many of the characters in the IPA set are direct derivatives of characters
    of the Roman alphabet. For a designer it is tempting to reuse the already designed
    glyphs to save time. While rotating characters 180 degrees results in maintaining
    the correct contrast, flipped &#40;mirrored&#41; characters look inconsistent
    with the rest of the set. <!--attachment: correction_of_contrast-33897.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*45.8*Stone%26%2344%3b+Times+and+Fedra*correction_of_contrast%2epdf

    <BR> <BR>The first IPA &#40;Passy 1888&#41; does not include any mirrored characters,
    but many rotated ones. There have been many subsequent revisions, and additions.
    Earlier phonetical alphabets use more accented characters &#40;Lepsius 1863&#41;,
    later ones introduce many new glyphs &#40;Pallum and Ladusaw 1986&#41;. 1993 revised
    IPA seems to be what we use today. <BR> <BR>My question is whether the &#39;wrong-looking&#39;
    contrast is a desirable effect of IPA. Should an &#39;ereversed&#39; looks like
    a mirrored &#39;e&#39;, or should it work like a letter on its own. Is it necessary
    to relate &#39;Ksmallreversed&#39; to a regular &#39;k&#39;? If there were to
    be letters on their own, it would make sense to &#39;correct&#39; their contrast.
    Please have a look at the attached document. The red ones look wrong to me, but
    maybe I am missing something. I would like to avoid replicating the already made
    mistakes and look at the intentions of the alphabet. Any advice is very welcome. '

  body: 'This is an interesting issue. For one thing, I wonder why Stone &#40;made
    by a chirographic designer&#41; would have &#34;incorrect&#34; weight distribution
    - maybe somebody at ITC added those? Otherwise your hunch that it&#39;s <i>supposed</i>
    to look like that might be true. <BR> <BR>One thing to consider is that the layman
    doesn&#39;t consciously care about &#34;correct&#34; strokes, so maybe it doesn&#39;t
    matter either way! In which case you should just save yourself the effort. The
    other thing to consider is that IPA is not meant for immersive reading, and in
    fact has horrible readability. This means that even if laymen do in fact mind
    &#34;incorrect&#34; weights in the <i>subconscious</i>, in the case of IPA that&#39;s
    moot. <BR> <BR>So if you make the strokes &#34;correct&#34;, you will be appealing
    to certain designers, and you won&#39;t be harming the reader. If you make the
    strokes &#34;incorrect&#34; you will be saving time, which you could say benefits
    the world more! <BR> <BR>&#62; Terminal of reversed e suddenly heavy is very strange?  <BR>
    <BR>This is a very good point, and causes an interesting observation: Even if
    perception of letterforms relies partly on the chirographic pattern of strokes,
    it certainly relies on symmetricity as well - especially in the consciousness
    &#40;where IPA works&#41;. <BR> <BR>And this brings on a VERY interesting question
    that I&#39;d never thought of before: if symmetricity is valuable, does that mean
    that within the standard/conventional Latin alphabet itself there are places where
    &#34;correct&#34; stroke weight causes discomfort? Is this why fonts with vertical
    stress, or constructed fonts, have a certain appeal? <BR> <BR>&#62; I will also
    check with some linguists. <BR> <BR>Just be careful: when gauging the layman,
    the questions you ask have to be very carefully considered -and presented- otherwise
    you will be guiding the answers. You have to carefully prod the consiousness to
    see what the <i>subconscious</i> is actually feeling. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I vote
    for &#34;incorrect&#34; stroke weight. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>Peter, when you say you are working on an IPA font, what is your actual
    intent: to support phonetic notation by linguists or to support the kind of subset
    of IPA often used in dictionaries. Full IPA support for linguists cannot be realistically
    done without Unicode and OpenType: the IPA alphabet is a generative system involving
    combining marks that need to be dynamically positioned. John Renner&#39;s Stone
    IPA tries to do as much as it can with kerning, but it is not very satisfactory:
    you need GPOS mark positioning to avoid clashes with extenders and in mark stacks.
    Ligation is needed to form word contour symbols. <BR> <BR>Finally, it is useful
    to bear in mind that numerous IPA characters are also used in the orthographies
    of natural languages, especially in Africa, so even if your intended market for
    new typefaces is linguists or lexicographers it is not unlikely that people may
    use the fonts for setting normal text. '

    the second time in like a year. I guess every Coalition of the Willing has its
    cracks.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>To be fair though, I think the distinctions you point
    out are indeed highly relevant. If this is for setting the occasional non-basic
    character in an otherwise plain-ASCII script, then it makes more sense to &#34;integrate&#34;
    the IPA glyphs. But if it&#39;s for setting &#34;pure&#34; IPA strings, it strikes
    me that the effort to give the glyphs &#34;correct&#34; strokes is better used
    somewhere more rewarding &#40;to the user if not the ideological play of the designer&#41;.
    One other thing: the chirographic &#34;rules&#34; of stroke weight distribution

  body: 'My recommendation to look at Gentium is mainly to see how Victor has handled
    the details of the &#39;reversed&#39; and &#39;rotated&#39; forms distinctly from
    the &#39;normal&#39; forms. Consider, for example, the open o vowel: the IPA letter
    that many designers treat as simply a rotated c. In Gentium, and also in some
    older and less chirographic IPA typefaces, this letter has its own form, its own
    identity, largely independent of the form of the c. I think this is good and useful
    and enhances both legibility and readability. <BR> <BR>Regarding the specific
    adjustment of contrast in Fedra, as shown in Peter&#39;s PDF, I think some of
    it works well &#40;the flipped epsilon and the open o&#41;, but it is too stronly
    applied in the flipped e, and looks very wrong in the rotated forms. I recommend
    that Peter take some time looking at Cyrillic typefaces and observing how mirrored
    forms like <i>zhe</i> and reversed forms &#40;in the sense of contrary to expected
    contrast pattern&#41; like <i>ya</i> are handled. Rather than a strong application
    of typical contrast pattern, these forms employ fairly subtle weight shifts. This
    is often especially noticeable in the bowl of the <i>ya.</i>'

  body: I don&#39;t take IPA as a writing system as Cyrillic, Latin are. More a tool
    to help to understood how to pronounce some words. I don&#39;t know if complete
    books set in an IPA font!? Its generally more unique words or couple of them used
    conjointly. At least in dictionnaries, language teaching books and so on. <BR>
    <BR>I take more IPA as a list of codes than a pure writing system. So, I don&#39;t
    see how a true design for flipped forms will help anything. <BR> <BR>May I wrong,

  body: Fedra IPA is made specifically for a set of dictionaries, it will probably
    exist only in PostScript, and it has to work with the main body text which is
    set in Fedra Serif. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your comments -- very useful, as usual,
    the truth is probably somewhere in between. I started making these revised contrast
    shapes when i realized that all flipped characters are fairly recent ones, probably
    at the times of photocomposition and early digital type. They didn&#39;t exist
    in metal, so i tried imaginging how they would look if they did. <BR> <BR>It is
    a good idea to look at Cyrillic and Gentium. Also, Victor&#39;s modification are
    subtle but ellegant.
