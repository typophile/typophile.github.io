body: "The following is from the specfication for Glyf tables in Apple's OTF file
  specification. http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6glyf.html\r\n\r\n\"If
  the x-short Vector bit is not set, and this bit is set, then the current x-coordinate
  is the same as the previous x-coordinate.\"\r\n\r\nIs is not clear whether they
  mean the *actual* x coordinate or the *relative* x coordinate.  What is actually
  stored in the table is relative offsets from the previously listed coordinate, so
  if the above statement refers to relative coordinates it would mean if you have
  a string of x coordinates \"3,3,3,3,....\" (indicating a constant angle for some
  stretch)  that just one \"3\" would be stored for that stretch.  OTOH if the above
  spec means *actual* x coordinates, it would mean that only in the case of a series
  of x's indicating a vertical line (i.e. no change in actual x coordinate) would
  all those x coordinates be collapsed to 1.\r\n\r\nSo I can't tell from the spec
  which they're referring to.  And you can't tell from looking at most ttf files because
  the above spec only applies when x coordinates are 2 bytes as opposed to 1, which
  will be in an extreme minority as most x offsets form the previous x will be small.\r\n\r\nSo
  an obscure question maybe, unless you have to parse TTF/OTF files directly (as in
  an application).  I wouldn't blame you guys if no one here knows this, but if knowledge
  of the TTF/OTF spec cannot be found here, then I don't know where.  "

    would do you know the answer to my question.\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: Thanks I'll get back in a bit and report what I found.   "Look at someone
    else's source" - what a concept.  THanks again.

  body: 'They look at the actual x coordinate which is what I first assumed as well.  But
    if the goal is space savings you might as well save all repeat relative offsets
    when they''re the same, (just as in the glyf spec any arbitrary flag is saved
    and repeated when the same as the previous).  But if sourceforge interprets it
    as the actual x coord and get away with it it must be OK.  '
