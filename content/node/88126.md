  at 40 East 35th St.  The structure started construction in 1940, but was not finished
  until 1948.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what font this is?\r\nAlso, is there any significance
  to the spacing (or lack thereof in some cases) to post war typography?\r\n\r\nTHANKS
  SO MUCH!\r\n\r\n<IMG SRC=\"http://i1218.photobucket.com/albums/dd407/m2park/TYPE.jpg\">"

  body: "It is very similar to \"Bernhard Gothic SG\" but the 'R' isn't quite right.
    It almost looks like more than one font as the 'W's appear to be different. It
    might just be in the Bernard family as it has flavors of \"Bernhard Fashion\"
    as well. The only font that I could find that had a similar 'R' is \"Eckhardt
    Titling JNL\"\r\n\r\nIf no one else can find the exact font you can put something
    together with those. Sorry I couldn't be of more help. Good luck!"
