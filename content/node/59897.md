  is government and foundations. The G in grants represents the start button on a
  computer and the typeface is [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/corporate_s_bold/|Corporate
  S Bold]]\r\n\r\nI don't design many logos so any feedback/suggestions would really
  appreciated.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/smartgrants_5128.png]"

  body: The Power-On is a cliche as far as its use in logos goes. I would consider
    some entirely different concept.

  body: "I agree with Epsilicon, but if you want to keep the power button theme then
    I suggest you have a look at it because the G looks a lot like an Euro symbol
    (except the Euro symbol has two horizontal stripes, instead of one), or in other
    words, it strikes me more like an E than a G. So I suggest looking into that (maybe
    make the bottom half of the G come a bit more up or make it connect with the horizontal
    part of G).\r\n\r\nI also suggest to increase the space between smarty & grants,
    because (to me at least) it seems to be one word, instead of two. (or was that
    intentional?\r\n\r\nP.S. English isn't my first language so sorry for any weird
    use of the language & type-o's."

  body: It also might be read "Smarty rants," which may be even worse.

    - it''s appreciated! I think I''ll have to play around with making the power-on

    posts and saw that I was wrong. I tried to read it correctly, but I wasn't...
    It definitelly doesn't read Grants... Sorry. You'll have to change that.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
