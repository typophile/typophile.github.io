  body: On a PC, every font is a member of a family that consists of 1-4 fonts but
    no more. The typical family consists of regular &#40;roman&#41;, italic, bold
    and bold italic. Of course, this is just a technical family, and fonts may also
    belong to much larger meta-families including additional weights, condensed or
    expanded, etc. However many fonts are in the overall family, they must be sorted
    into discreet families of 1-4 fonts, and this controls the relationship of font
    styles so that, when you press the italic button in Word for example, you get
    the font that is associated with your roman font in a particular family. Does
    that make sense? <BR> <BR>In your graphic, the large name at the top of the window
    is the font name, which includes the style extension &#40;e.g. ITC Officina Sans
    Bold&#41; and which corresponds to the &#39;Full Name&#39; in the font file. The
    smaller name below, labelled &#39;Typeface name:&#39; is actually the name of
    the discreet font family &#40;e.g. ITC Officina Sans Book&#41;. So in this case
    you probably have a family that shows up in menus as <BR> <BR>     ITC Officina
    Sans Book <BR> <BR>and which contains these four fonts <BR> <BR>     ITC Officina
    Sans&#42; <BR>     ITC Officina Sans Italic <BR>     ITC Officina Sans Bold <BR>     ITC
    Officina Sans Bold Italic <BR> <BR>&#42;This font may or may not include the style
    extension Regular. <BR> <BR>Of course, the overall ITC Officina family contains
    many more than four fonts, so these are organised into additional 1-4 style families.
    <BR> <BR>In OpenType fonts, there are name table fields that allow you to maintain
    the functionality of the 1-4 style families in Windows while also grouping larger
    number of fonts together. Adobe takes advantage of these in their split menus,
    and I suspect future versions of MS software will also.
