body: "I'm currently trying to construct two very unusual glyphs to go with the Minion
  font family.\r\n\r\nThe first is the IPA character for the sound <em>j</em> as in
  \"les <em>j</em>eux sont faits\", sometimes called \"ezh\", Unicode 0292. Unfortunately,
  I haven't found a suitable example. The glyph looks like the top of the z glyph
  combined with the bottom of the numeral 3.\r\n\r\nThe second is the character \"hv\"
  used in Gothic transliteration. It looks like a combination of the h and u glyphs
  but without the lower right foot/serif of the u. Unicode  scalar value is 0195,
  plus I've attached my first feeble attempt at creating one.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
  I have no experience at all in designing type.\r\nAre there any language/letterform
  aficionados who have dealt with these characters and who have two minutes to drop
  a comment?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    you a message as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAs you may all have noticed already,
    I've put up an attachment that works (for me, at the very least). It's a quite
    funny character, indeed, so do check it out."

  body: "So, in conclusion one may assume that the forms of these two characters are
    very much in the hands of the designer -- I'm still quite unsure about the details
    of the glyphs, as there is little material to study and compare. They are just
    too rare.\r\n\r\n(eg the right part of the \"hv\" -- a lowercase u? Something
    else? And the bottom of \"ezh\" or \"dram\" -- numeral 3? lc j? lc one-story g?
    Oh well.)"

  body: "David, your hwair is quite respectable looking. One thing to check: the two
    counters should be slightly narrower than those of the h and u, in the same way
    that the counters of the m are usually narrower than that of the n. This stops
    the letter from being too wide overall.\r\n\r\nI recently had to design an ezh
    for my SBL BibLit typeface. Earlier, in the unreleased IPA portion of Sylfaen
    that I made for Microsoft in 1998, I reversed the contrast on the upper strokes,
    which seems quite common and follows a natural broadnib ductus. But for textual
    harmony I think it is better to match the stroke contrast of the z. I've put an
    image of the SBL Biblit ezh online at http://www.tiro.com/John/ezh.gif"

  body: "Well, John, that's exactly what I feared would be inevitable: Meddling with
    those tricky B\xE9zier curves! (I was hoping I could somehow cobble the glyphs
    together with parts of other, existing glyphs ...)\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough,
    the lc \"m\" in Minion consists of almost exactly two \"n\" glyphs together! The
    basic \"n\" form is consistent in other glyphs, as well -- an \"m\" in the mask
    layer of the \"hv\" glyph (which consists of \"h\" and \"u\") fits it exactly!\r\n\r\nStill,
    as you will observe in the uploaded picture \"m_vs_hv.jpg\", the \"hv\" glyph
    appears to be somehow wider, even too wide, and less dark than the \"m\". Hrm."
