  Language of the Text</a> \u201D\r\n12.02.2007 \u2013 19.02.2007\r\n\r\nMy gratitude
  goes to my associates G\xFCl Ka\xE7maz Erk & Selma G\xF6ker for having made this
  project feasible, and to all the 2nd year students involved, for having undertaken
  the task in one week only, and with admirable results.  Last but not least I'd like
  to thank Dr. Hakan Ertep & Dr. Tevfik Balcioglu for their understanding.\r\n\r\nThe
  letters of the alphabet, the characters of a typeface are building blocks ; as well
  as I believe that writing is architecture, <em>may graphic design & typography not
  be banned</em>."

    letterform (besides <em>triangle</em> & <em>square</em>).\r\nIn the gallery the
    images of the architectures are just reported as text references."

    of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edutainment\">edutainment</a>,\" and
    that was the first time I heard that word.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
