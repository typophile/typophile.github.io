  some problems attaching my file. I've made a new font & even though there's nothing
  new to it, I do like the outcome. Now my question is if it's actually worth kerning
  (since there's nothing new to it & I really dread the process of kerning) & if so
  if any of you have any tips on kerning?"

    the .gif, I would say the comma's/quotes could use some more body. Maybe by making
    them longer a bit. They are not too different from a period, right now. That ampersand
    is a nice touch. :)"

  body: Please show us some text set in it or better still, show us how you think
    it might be used if not for text. It's hard to critique a face outside of a context.
    I think there are some fixes to do before kerning. Maybe not too. Seeing how you
    plan to space it matters too - spacing and shape relate to each other. It seems
    a little wide in your sample. Or have you just not thought about that aspect yet?
    It does seem like it's worth going after a bit more even if it just ends up just
    being a learning experience. You can't know if it will go 'all the way' yet. And
    I think that's okay. The style is a good one to be working on just now it seems.

    \"copy/pasterie\").\r\nI'm glad you like the ampersand, Quincunx... I had a regular
    one stroke keyboard-like ampersand first, but changed it afterwards ;-)"

  body: "- Why not connect the dgbqp to their vericals sooner so the counter shape
    is less completely round?\r\n- A related point the joins on those same letters
    & the joins on the rnm seem a little clotted or heavy\r\n- The m & w seem overly
    wide to me. I am not suggesting a big change - just a small one.\r\n- The k feels
    awkward to me.\r\n- The ascenders are so short they are beginning to a little
    cramped to my eye. \r\n- the h seems odd with one leg lifted like that. Why is
    it like that?\r\n- The weight is at the top & bottom rather that the two sides.
    Is that because the face is so geometric & you have not accounted for the illusion
    that creates? Or is it on purpose?\r\n- The counter on the 4 seems small. \r\n-
    The 3 needs to be reworked. It feels awkward.\r\n- The paces between words seem
    too big and the kerning between letters seesm too tight.\r\n- The dots on your
    puntuation are too light.\r\n\r\nI like the way your s seems to be top heavy &
    yet balances. I ca't tell if it's going to be okay in the long run yet since there
    is no PDF but if you can carry it it could be a nice feature and point of difference
    with other fonts of this kind. I suggest setting more text with it and seeing
    what combinations are uncomfortable. If you want I can send you some pangrams
    to try. In general though it is holding together nicely. I like the size of the
    opening on your c. It feels just right. I really like your y. I would try to be
    sure that other glyphs fit nicely with it litterally and in terms of matching
    it's 'feeling'. "
