  you guys can help. It's simillar to Gill Sans Display, but not quite. In the image
  attached it's the typeface that says \"syst3m\", but it does not have those vertical
  lines in it. That's something the designer seems to have added. If it rings a bell
  please let me know! Thanks -Derek\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/syst3m_6387.jpg]"
