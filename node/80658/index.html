  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">At some point I learned about trying to make strictly horizontal and vertical handles with my beziers, wherever possible. And I avoid unnecessary points... e.g. a perfect circle ought to be four points. 

When I open other people's fonts, particularly scripts, the curves look so perfect. Like someone took a circle or ellipse and then chopped it half (or wherever). Or maybe did the equivalent of drawing a stroke in illustrator and outlining it. 

When I try to draw curves on my own, I'm awkwardly stretching first this horizontal handle, then that vertical, then the horizontal... as the curve seems to bulge towards one side or the other. Just when I think I have it perfect, I zoom out, and it's not right, the curve's skewed. I look at this image and think "how'd that get so clean and perfect, especially where the the bowl fattens.

Is there some trick to this, a way of measuring the length of handles relative to each other? Or is it just eyeballed?

You'll have to switch back to Bezier mode before final output to fine-tune some things, and probably before that because certain operations don't work as predictably in Spiro mode, but I think you'll be happier with the curves you produce once you get used to it.</div>

• Optimally each handle should extend about 1/3 of the distance of the curve. But you have to break this rule a lot.
• Good curves look continuous and not like a series of smaller curves. You have to shift-drag nodes along a curves to get the sweet spot.
• Learn to work by shift-clicking on curves and dragging them around instead of using the handles. Only touch handles to make minor adjustments.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the responses so far. Dunwich's especially, it never even occurred to me to just draw the extrema points and go from there, but it makes sense as I think about it. And the shift-clicking on curves too, I'd been strictly working with the handles. I never really played with manipulating the curves directly because mostly I've drawn in illustrator. I'm not sure if illy even allows this.

I will also check out Spiro and the remix tools. <em>edit: so I have to run cygwin emulator to run fontforge, then figure out how to add the plugin? Don't suppose there's an easier path for a lazy windows user?</em>

Nick - as for deleting the center point on the curve, when I open fonts I often see these points, and when you outline them in illustrator etc. you get dozens of extra unneeded points. But if I see a center point in, say, fontlab, does that mean the designer added them? Or just some quirk of how fontlab draws the glyph?

JM: I used your graphic because it struck me how perfect the curves looked. Since it was the inspiration for the thread, I decided it would be suitable to show what I meant (to show what really nice perfect curves look like, as opposed to the crap I produce). I was in no way criticizing you or anything you've made. In my ignorance I thought the little blue points were the handles on the beziers, and it struck me how consistent they were. But apparently they're not. My apologies.</div>

It does, but it doesn’t work well. Your best bet when drawing type is to just not use Illustrator for anything other than prototyping. I have yet to find anything better for drawing type than Fontlab Studio.

Stay away from Fontforge if you’re not a competent Linux/UNIX user.</div>

To each his own: personally, I find CorelDraw 9 to be superior to ANY other program for drawing fonts but, then again, I've been a CorelDraw user since version 1.

<em>if I see a center point in, say, fontlab, does that mean the designer added them? Or just some quirk of how fontlab draws the glyph?</em>

It's not a quirk: it's the proper way to draw bezier curves for PostScript. Autotracing in ANY program tends to introduce a lot of superfluous points: it's best to draw the oultines on your own, from scratch...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Working with Illustrator, if you can, do any outlining in a pre-CS3 version of illustrator. I still have CS2 installed on my machine for exactly this purpose. It does a good job of minimizing the number of points and not creating overlapping points. In my opinion, this feature in CS3 and higher is broken.

I always use Illustrator to draw glyphs, probably because I have years of practical experience working with it. Just a question of ease of use.</div>
