  body: I just noticed how different the n's are ... probably not a font.  If you
    could suggest something with a fancy 'A' and 'y' ... similar but doesn't have
    to even be close ... it will be appreciated.

  body: I stand corrected! You'll have to excuse me for not wanting to trawl through
    dozens of Bodoni digitizations to confirm this one, so let's just leave it at
    'Bodoni'. I really was convinced it was Times. Good one, Simon, and sorry for
    giving the impression I was trying to snag your ID. ;^)
