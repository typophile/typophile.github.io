  but the ampersand was different and the serif tapered much sharper.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tiffany.com/\r\n\r\nThanks"

    Can anyone else confirm?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hoefler and Frere Jones retooled the logo a few years back under the art
    direction of Paula Scher at Pentagram.\r\n\r\nThey also created a font family
    called Sterling. I don't believe it will be released commercially however.\r\n\r\nThis
    screengrab is from the AIGA design archives site:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sterling_3777.png]"

  body: "Yeah, I don't think Sterling will ever be released publicly. Tiffany also
    commisioned Pantone to come up with a special Pantone Tiffany Blue (PMS 1837 as
    in the year the company was founded) for their boxes, bags and other collateral
    (Print March/April 2004).\r\n\r\nIt just bugs me that Tiffany keeps mixing Sterling
    with Helvetica in their ads. It's like commisioning a custom Ferrari and then
    buying floor mats at Costco."
