body: "I am reproducing a 1938 Elto Cub outboard motor gas tank top decal.  A couple
  years ago I had some great help here finding the main font named Stymie.  It is
  perfect.  \r\n\r\nNow I am down to some final BOLD lettering that is different.
  \ I ran these (attached) files against WhatTheFont engine and came close.  It recommended
  Chocolat BOLD.  But the lower case \"e\" and \"k\" are clearly different.  And I
  think Chocolat BOLD is much more recent than 1938 ..\r\n\r\nI have attached pictures
  of the only two areas of the tank that have this different looking bold smooth font.
  \ These are pictures from an original 1938 gas tank (a small section of it), so
  they are a bit blurry. The lettering has blended over the years.\r\n\r\nI am hoping
  there were not that many rounded type fonts in the 1930s .. so maybe some good eyeballs
  here could help.  I will attach two files for review.\r\n\r\nThanks !\r\n\r\nDenny
