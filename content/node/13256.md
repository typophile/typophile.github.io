body: "hello all, \r\nI am designing a logo for a local barbershop quartet organization
  called 13th Colony Sound. It is an organization of mainly retired gentlemen that
  get together and perform. \r\n\r\nWith the logo, from what I understand, they want
  to capture the feeling of barbershop quartet as well as their southern \"Savannah\"
  location. The first I feel has been not to hard to capture. But with the Savannah
  feeling, I've tried to be a bit more subtle, using a Clarendon for the mustache
  and modified Clarendon for the nose, giving it that old-timey southern feeling.
  I want the logo to be fun, avoid the impulse of using a barbers pole, but reference
  the barbershop with the slicked over hair. I think the 13 should read as a nose
  and mustache first, and the number 13 second.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts, is
  it working? Is there a unified nature to it, or is this just a bunch of elements
  thrown together? How can I make this better? Thanks.\r\n\r\nhttp://studentpages.scad.edu/~sreinh21/13thColony.gif"

  body: There is so much distance between the nose and mouth that I did not read it
    as a mouth at first. You might want to consider reducing or condensing the 3 some.

    use an quote mark? Keeping it inline with an all-type logo?)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanks for the comments, I'm condensing the 3, making the mouth more of an
    oval, and less of a circle. Also Im making the eyes look a little more like eyes,
    and not dots.\r\n\r\n\"I\u2019m not sure why there\u2019s a giant sperm on the
    top of the face.\"\r\n\u2013In context I don't relate the slicked over/old barbershop
    ad look of the hair to sperm. Point taken though. \r\n\r\nI'm not trying to make
    this an all type logo, just the 1 and the 3. i appreciate the help"

    Try playing with the scale as well because his eyes are too close together.\r\nTim"

  body: Why not make it all type based? We're designers, of course, so maybe the non-character
    elements stick out more, but I think it'd be fun to at least try one that is all
    type-based.

  body: aluminum, I am totally with you. My instinct tells me to do an all-type based
    logo, but I wonder, is it appropriate. If the organization was more design oriented
    then yes it would seem. My intention for the logo is for the viewer to view a
    well designed illustration, i suppose, of a barbershop quartet singer, then the
    1 and the 3 are to pop out. Kind of an "oh yea!" type of thing. It was based on
    the name "13th colony sound." I do understand that the eyes resemble apostrophes,
    and that might be why there's a push for an all-type based mark. I really appreciate
    your comments and suggestions everyone, this is very helpful.

    happy with the result, but wish I had more time to get your thoughts regarding
    the wordmark.  With such short time alotted for this, I had to go ahead make some
    decisions rather quickly. Thanks for your great help! \r\n\r\nhttp://studentpages.scad.edu/~sreinh21/BikeParty/HTML/barbershop.htm"
