  body: If you are interested in free, distressed typefaces, check out www.misprintedtype.com.
    There are many free typefaces available and the ones you need to pay for are not
    expensive. I cannot say what is most appropriate for your project, but you may
    find more subtlety in Eduardo Recife's treatment of distressed letterforms.
