  and thought I managed to recover some stuff, though most of my fonts are unusable
  (font files showing up as Unix Executable Files) and I am urgently searching for
  Johann-Light and I am coming up short on all fronts.\r\n\r\nAny help or suggestions
  on where to find it or something similar? This sans serif font has a more whimsical
  feel to it."

  body: 'Just a guess regarding the unusable fonts: If you are trying to recover rather
    old Mac fonts, the actual font data used to be stored in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork">resource
    forks</a> of files in Classic Mac OS. You could try accessing this data by using
    "ditto --rsrc-fork" when recovering from your backups. '

  body: I don't know, there are so much different font variation. I usually use google
    fonts. At least they are very good quality and you can be sure they would work
    on all websites. According to the <a href="http://essayguard.com/services/essaysmaster">reviews
    on Essays Master</a> Google Fonts is really useful and simple site to get fonts.
    There are pretty many of different variations.
