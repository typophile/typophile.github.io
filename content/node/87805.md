    Capitals presented here.

  body: "Sorry Riccardo\r\n\r\nI should have been more clear... sorry. The very condensed
    forms with lighter verticals is very much of the Rustic ilk. Ondine \"squooooooshed\"
    and very condensed  :-0 does take on the shapes. I was commenting on the historical
    value.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RC_5218.png]\r\n\r\nOndine has
    a much higher weight to height ratio in its intended use and is from a different
    century. Odd that one would think to do this to a font to achieve that end. Notice
    the bold horizontals which bow to the Hebraic and Arabic forms."

  body: "Thank you for the follow up Michael. I wasn\u2019t familiar with Rustic capital
    style.\r\nThat said, I\u2019m afraid very few people care about historical or
    stylistic accuracy, or plausibility, and when they squoosh, they squoosh for saving
    space, not for attaining some effect. Which is sad (and ugly to boot)."
