    to this act on their web pages and online courses.

    are subject to the same laws and ethical standards as any other profession?

  body: "I can't speak for UK laws, but a lot of US laws pertaining to disability
    issues have some rather large loopholes in them.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing some of the
    issues related to graphic design, such as public signage and government produced
    documents adhere to some more specific regulations. However, things like web sites
    really haven't been regulated to that great of an extent yet. Again, I'm just
    talking about US laws at the moment. I know the UK has been a bit more specific
    regarding some of this (and, of course, any legislation in '95 likely doesn't
    have a whole lot of relevance to specific things like the Web)\r\n\r\n"

    research <em>hints</em>:\r\n\r\n1. Adaptive Environments.\r\n2. EIDD.\r\n3. The
    Power of Information (Mayo and Steinberg).\r\n4. Go to the European Disability
    Forum and search on media disability.\r\n5. W3C WAI and WCAG.\r\n6. IBM Able.\r\n7.
    Photosymbols.\r\n8. And for a proper student enrag\xE9e, something has happened
    with Watchfire and Bobby Online.\r\n "
