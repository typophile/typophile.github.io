body: 'Greetings all. I have a monospace font called Impersonal which was designed
  in Fontographer, and a user has recently complained that the spacing is so crowded
  that some letters actually overlap. This seems to be happening only in some applications
  on Mac OS 9.x. I built the font in OS 9.6, and have successfully tested it in Microsoft
  Word, Adobe InDesign, Illustrator and PhotoShop in OS 10.3.5. I can&#39;t replicate
  the problem, except in Lemke&#39;s FontBook, where, sure enough, the spacing does
  in fact look much too crowded. A screen grab from InDesign is attached, showing
  how the font is supposed to look &#40;in the red box&#41; and how it actually does
  look in FontBook &#40;blue box&#41;. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: Impersonal_Problem-48409.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*41.3*Impersonal+Problem*Impersonal+Problem%2epdf

  <BR> <BR>All characters in the font are the same width &#40;580&#41;, and there
  are no kerning pairs. I don&#39;t know why Lemke&#39;s FontBook would jam everything
  together, or why the spacing looks bad in whatever word processor this user is using.
  It works fine for me in all other applications. <BR> <BR>Any ideas? I&#39;m not
  sure how to solve the problem since there is no kerning or other metrics to adjust.'
