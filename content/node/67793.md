body: "I've been quite interested in the idea of creating a couple of fonts for a
  while now, but although I'm a skilled graphic designer, (and therefore good with
  Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Quark) when it comes to software for creating fonts
  I'm really not sure where to start.\r\n\r\nA few years ago I did briefly have access
  to a copy of Fontographer, which at the time was a real standard for this kind of
  software. Is this still the case or should I be looking at getting another program?
  What is the best software for creating fonts now?\r\n\r\nAll tips, hints and recommendations
  will be appreciated."
