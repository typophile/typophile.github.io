<div class=commentbody><i>...would you have trouble equating Christians with Nazi's?</i> <br> <br>What do you mean? If you are pointing out that many people who considered themselves Christians joined the Nazi party and supported Hitler, obviously this is terribly true. If you are pointing to the contribution of 19 centuries of Christian antisemitism in European culture to the making the Holocaust possible, you will get no argument from me. However, if you are suggesting that the tenets of Christian belief and Nazi ideology are the same, then obviously this is not true. They are, at least, different, and most people would agree that they are plainly incompatible: you need to grossly distort one to arrive at the other. <br> <br>Also, I'm increasingly of the opinion that the term 'Christian' is close to meaningless today, and probably has been since long before even the rise of protestantism. There is no religion called Christianity, and the most that can be said is that the term recognises the central position of the figure of Christ in a great number of different religions that do not agree on who or what Christ was.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>no religion called Christianity <br> <br>Perhaps no single religion, but a group of religions. Any religion recognizing the divinity of Jesus may reasonably be called Christian. This leaves out Jews,Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and probably Unitarians.

<div class=commentbody>BTW, William, you should know that a recent BBC survey (<i>slightly</i> more objective than some of your sources...) showed that there was greater support for Israel's "policy" towards the Palestinians than there is within Israel itself! Not even counting its 10% Arab population. What does that tell you? Or at least us, who are not encumbered by a legacy coping mechanism... <br> <br>You can pretend to be compassionate (or even merely pragmatic) as much as you want, but the fact on the ground is that the US (in its broader political presence of the House and Senate, even more than the White House) unwaveringly supports apartheid measures such as the limiting of marriages and the construction of artificial concrete borders*. Only the people already brainwashed are fooled. Claiming that popular opinion guides foreign (or even domestic) policy is part of the deception. So is the use of "Democracy" like a blunt weapon. But this two-faced approach will get you in the end. <br> <br>* Something you won't hear on CNN or Fox: <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3334235.stm target=_blank>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3334235.stm</a> <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>As a U.S. citizen, I neither support nor reflect the actions of the U.S. government; in the same way, being a Jew doesn't make one a human incarnation of the state of Israel. Let's try to remember that the set "Jews" overlaps with but is different from the set "Israel." It's sloppy and inaccurate to equate the two. Plus, it annoys us Jews. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Certainly, but let's not make that a convenient escape. Jews are responsible for the actions of Israel, since Israel is The Jewish State. US Jews are responsible for the actions of Israel <i>and</i> the US (although they might prioritize one over the other as they see fit). I'm responsible for three.

However, off the top of my head, I can think of at least a few sects who at least consider themselves nominal Christian that do not believe in the divinity of Christ and/or who believe Christ's sacrifice redeems us only of individual sin. <br> <br>My main point is that the term Christian doesn't refer to anything specific.

<div class=commentbody><i>It is my observation that how an individual or subgroup interprets and applies the set of beliefs is as important as the beliefs themselves, or moreso, when it comes to how the faith is actually lived.</i> <br> <br>Absolutely. The idea that a religion is a set of beliefs reflects, in my opinion, a distinctly individualist, protestant interpretation: what a friend of mine -- herself a protestant -- calls 'head religion'. It ultimately leads people to think they can be religious without actually doing anything. Catholicism is emphatically a set of beliefs <i>and a set of actions,</i> both individual and communal, and this is also the impression I have of Judaism. There are things one should believe and there are things that one should do, and together they define the way one should live.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Stop the frenzy, back on topic, and see what I've found by chance: <br><a href=http://www.undt.co.uk/pukkaexplanation.html target=_blank>http://www.undt.co.uk/pukkaexplanation.html</a> <br>It's an interview conducted by Steven Heller, for a new book he's working on, about the education of type designers, with Marcus McCallion on his typeface Pukka. <br>McCallion is the mind behind the Undt type foundry and works also with Jonathan Barnbrook on the development of Virus faces. <br>The points expressed in the interview are very similar to what Heller have already said in his many articles and books on the Swastika topic, and McCallion's answers keep underlining what I consider the point, which was, in a very similar way, the same behind Jonathan's own Manson "craze", and behind this Microsoft Dingbat silly story. <br>The discussion fostered, of course, from the inspiration behind the Pukka typeface which, needless to say, puts in discussion the demonization of the Svastika and the polivalent meaning of symbols as we already talked about at typographi.ca, using a swastika form (both cw and ccw) for its "x" glyphs. <br>That's, more or less, my idea and intention, when I talk of "redemption" of symbols put to an ominous use.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Freedom of speech exists only to the extent of getting people to think they actually have it when they don't. Freedom of speech is also beneficial in reducing the motivation for freedom of <i>action</i>: when you can complain about something to your buddies (although never really in mass media) you are less likely to <i>do</i> anything about it. The anti-establishment ideas are not new, they're all out there, so discussing them is moot. The important thing is to make people more vegetative by giving them comfortable illusions like freedom of speech and democracy. <br> <br>> Why designers, instead of complaining about non-issues, don't start employing this typeface on pieces against racism .... <br> <br>That's verbotten because it would limit the ability of the System to keep perpetrating those things. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Freedom of speech is something guaranteed by some <i>states,</i> it is not something guaranteed by companies -- such as eBay --, which reserve the right to discriminate as to what is said or expressed in or via the services that they offer. Freedom of speech means that you won't be arrested, fined, thrown into jail, executed, etc. <i>by the state</i> for saying things, and this is the basis on which it must be judged. It is fair and accurate to observe that some states that affect to guarantee freedom of speech also impose limits on that freedom, but it is neither fair nor accurate to present, as an example of the restriction of freedom of belief, the decision of a company like eBay exercising its rights to define the ways in which its services may be used.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>Freedom of speech means that you won't be arrested, fined, thrown into jail, executed, etc.</i> <br> <br>Many people who have excercised such rights by way of peacful protests no longer suffer from this illusion. How about getting gassed, beaten and firehosed in Canada sound? <br> <br>I recall the Ottawa free trade talks which included the countries of Central America. The then Prime Minister Jean Cretien had just issued a scathing lecture to these countries on human rights abuse. CBC interviewed one Central American representatives directly afterwards asking for reflections on the human rights lecture. The Central American representative pointed his finger to the TV monitors in the hallways showing civilians almost drowing pinned to a fence. His response was, <i>it looks like fairly low bar, I think we can manage.</i> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, as I said: 'It is fair and accurate to observe that some states that affect to guarantee freedom of speech also impose limits on that freedom'. I'm not debating whether freedom of speech is illusory, I'm saying that it is disingenuous to use the service policies of a company like eBay as evidence of a lack of freedom of speech <i>because such policies are under no obligation to provide freedom of speech.</i> When peaceful protesting students at UBC are pepper-sprayed by RCMP officers reporting directedly to the Prime Minister's Office, it is an infringement of freedom of speech; when eBay says it won't allow you to sell SS memorabilia using its services, it is not. The government has an obligation under the constitution to provide a level of freedom of speech that includes peaceful protest. eBay is under no obligation to allow you to sell SS memorabilia.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The example you cited is an "additional example of abuse". It was the same government, same Prime Minister. The example I was citing was the Ottawa "Free Trade Talks".

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, there are two things to take into account when comparing different democratic states: one is the mechanism of democracy employed and the other is the political culture of the society. Neither of these things can be considered in isolation, either from each other or from other factors, including external factors, but together they provide a basic understanding of the differences between, say, Canada and Finland. Only some of these differences can be understood in terms of different democratic mechanisms (e.g. first-past-the-post vs. proportional representation); in order to 'accumulate an unimaginable variation of different ideals' you need a political culture that encourages such diversity as well as the mechanism to give voice to it. It also helps to be a relatively small country in which ideas are a greater factor in everyday political discourse than geography and regionalism. <br> <br>Bearing these two things (democratic mechanisms and political culture) in mind, let me answer your question: <i>Is Israel a democracy John?</i> <br> <br>Yes, Israel is a democracy, and in purely mechanical terms, it is much more like Finland than like Canada. Indeed, one can easily argue that proportional representation, which in the Finnish political culture reflects a diversity of ideals, is one of the factors contributing to what you object to about Israeli government policy. For example, extremist settler groups can find a voice in parliament as a result of proportional representation, and can influence voting blocks on issues affecting the occupied territories. At the same time, Israel manages its own 'unimaginable variation of different ideals' -- especially unimaginable to those who see Israel only in terms of the Palestinian conflict --, including a very significant peace movement and a democratic judiciary that has been effectively utilised by human rights organisations representing Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories. Considering the particular political culture -- and the external factors that contribute to it -- that resulted in the election of Ariel Sharon, you might pause to consider what kind of country Finland would be if it had spent the past 50 years in near-continuous conflict with belligerent neighbours.</div>

That Fins should now turn to genocide exterminating the Swedish settlers still on it's shores. That now, Fins would be entitled to build 14 foot concrete walls around these Swedes, shoot their woman and children, and also any Swede that <i>dare protest,</i> bulldoze their houses, separate them from employment, farms and fields.

The Germans put an end to the threat. After which the Fins drove out the Germans returning to the threat of Russia. This stopped at the end of the cold war.

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, if 'Israel is a democracy for Jews only' how come they have representatives of Arab political parties sitting in their parliament? How come they have an Arab judge sitting on their High Court? How come my Arab Israeli friends are able to vote in Israeli elections? How come my Arab Israeli friends would rather be citizens of Israel than of, say, Syria, or even Jordan or Egypt? <br> <br>Understand, I'm not saying that Israeli democracy is anything like perfect, or that the legal position of Arab Israelis can't be significantly improved (not least by prohibiting private discrimination against them by employers, etc.). But it is a calumny to say that Israel is a democracy only for Jews. <br> <br>It is also a calumny to accuse the Israelis of genocide: a calumny against both the Israelis and the Palestinian fighters. When much of the world's media was swallowing the lie that Israeli troops had deliberately massacered civilians in Jenin (a lie that still gets repeated, despite even the report of <i>Palestinian</i> doctors in Jenin that the massacre never took place), the Palestinian Authority was declaring a military victory in Jenin because 15 Israeli soldiers had been killed in the <i>battle.</i> If the Israelis wanted to practice genocide, this whole conflict would be over in a matter of minutes. Instead, Israel puts its soldiers at risk conducting infantry searches for armed militants who have declared themselves to be dedicated to the destruction of Israel -- not to peace, not to human rights, not to a separate Palestinian state: 'Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it' (Hassan al-Banna quoted in the Hamas Covenant) --; if it were interested in genocide, Israel could level entire towns with missiles without any risk to its own soldiers. As I've said in the past, much of Israel's actions in the occupied territories are immoral and illegal -- including the crime of turning off the water supply to Jenin during the incursion --, but calling it 'genocide' is unsupportable by the evidence of either the method or the result.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John Butler <br> <br>Germans, nor the Italians, (I have personal knowledge of Italian right of return immigration practices regarding ancestry) require racial purity, proof of "motherhood", or spiritual gravity towards specific religions as condition to their return immigration practices. They require proof their ancestors lived in Germany, or Italy. Skin colour is not a requirement. <br> <br>That is not racism.

<div class=commentbody><i>Skin colour is not a requirement. [...] That is not racism. That is claiming ancestral rights.</i> <br> <br>Interesting. Skin colo[u]r is not a requirement in Israel either. <br> <br><i>Why, do you think the German state is racist?</i> <br> <br>Actually I don't. But <a href=http://www.indybay.org/news/2002/12/1553620.php>the article you cited</a> seems to think it is. It cites the Right of Return law as proof that Israel is "racist." (Do you read the articles you link to?) So by extension, Germany's immigration laws would also fall into that category. (And who knows how many other countries...) Or perhaps the article just <b>applies that standard selectively to Israel,</b> as you seem to be doing. <br> <br>I'm actually quite fond of modern Germany. I have a degree in German. I almost took a job there a few years back.</div>

<div class=commentbody>A person who converts is a full Jew, including the right of return. This demonstrates that Judaism is not a race as defined traditionally or by the state of Israel. <br> <br>Qualification for return has nothing to do with race. Israel has people of every color, including Jews of Ethiopia and from all corners of the Arab world, who racially look the same as their Muslim cousins. <br> <br>Your readiness to cite and repeat rubbish put out by haters of Jews and Israel, in spite of its falsity and malice being pointed out to you by many people here, is pitiful.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>...your own recursive propaganda juggernaut.</i> <br> <br>Having read plenty of pro-Israeli media that overlooks even the most grievous atrocities committed by the IDF, I have no argument that propaganda -- in the sense of unapologetically biased reporting -- exists and is a real barrier to understanding the situation in the Middle East. But the majority of propaganda I see favours the Palestinian cause and regularly misrepresents both Israel and the Palestinian militant organisations. This is true of much of the reports from Reuters, Associated Press, BBC and other wire services and frequently cited news sources. Reuters, for example, regularly refers to Hamas as an organisation 'fighting for a Palestinian state', while failing to report that this (Islamic theocratic, non-democratic) state is intended to occupy the entire territory of Israel. <i>This</i> propaganda juggernaut has completely distorted the history of the Arab Israeli conflict, and it has been swallowed whole by a depressingly large number of presumably well-meaning, liberal people in Europe and North America. And then there is the anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish propaganda in the Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority. I have a very good friend who lives in Cairo, who reports that most of the Egyptian population believes that 'the Jews' were responsible for the attack on the World Trade Centre and offers as 'evidence' the 'fact' reported in Egyptian newspapers that no Jews showed up for work at the WTC that morning. And this is in an Arab country that has a peace treaty with Israel, so one can only imagine what the Syrians, Saudis, etc. are being told by their governments. <br> <br>Rather than 'listening to the world', why not try being committed to the truth? There's plenty of propaganda from both sides to sift through, without adding to it by making inapplicable and insupportable accusations of genocide and racism.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> the majority of propaganda I see favours the Palestinian cause <br> <br>If that's really the case, it's because you're listening to a broad spectrum. It's a sad truth that what Americans are listening to matters more than what anybody else is listening to, and that happens to be the Jewish flavor of things. <br> <br>My compaint isn't that Jews get all the propaganda, it's that: <br>1) They get the lion's share in the world's remaining superpower. <br>2) The citizenry of that superpower doesn't realize the lopsidedness. <br> <br>When somebody wields power repressively and deceptively, it's bad for the world. I have no problem with concentrated power (remember, I'm a monarchist), I have a problem with injustice, and more power it wields the deeper we're in the hole. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>William <br> <br>I am sorry, it seems to me that you were trying to show me something. <br> <br>Anyway, you pointed to this link, <br> <br><a href=http://www.indybay.org/news/2002/12/1553620.php target=_blank>http://www.indybay.org/news/2002/12/1553620.php</a> <br> <br>and gave personal expression that Israel's immigration policy is <i>not racist.</i> That you may be black, yellow or any colour as long as you are "Jewish". Ironic, well know anti-semite <i>Henry Ford</i> said, "You can have any colour you like as long as you like black." <br> <br>This is a clear case of <i>Ethnoism</i> which is more pernicious than <i>Racism.</i> This contradicts <i>Common Law Inclusion</i> of a <i>Right of Return</i> immigration policy. Therefore, it is misleading. Which, I assume, explains your confusion. It could have been written <i>Every Jewish person has a right to immigrate to Israel, the rest of you, we don't care if your ancestor was Jesus Christ, bug off.</i> What do you think? Just a suggestion. <br> <br>By the way William, your words in italic. <br> <br><i>A person who converts is a full Jew, including the right of return. This demonstrates that Judaism is not a race as defined traditionally or by the state of Israel.</i> <br> <br>I am not sure if this is in affect, but I believe the law is changed, or in the process, that Jewish converts will not be so allowed <i>Right of Return.</i> <br> <br><b>NOTES:</b> <br> <br>1.) I accept a nation has a right to draft their own immigration policy, racist, ethnoist or not. <br> <br></div>
