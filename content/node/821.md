    I&#39;d say the lettering on that sign is a somewhat westernized rendition of
    an old Byzantine script. The T26 font seems to be closer to the authentic stuff,

    Greek Orthodox Manuscripts or rather manuscripts held as important to the Greek
    Orthodox church. -- Hmm. I&#39;m curious now. I think I&#39;ll do look.

    they perceived it to be. Meaning, the humanists had mistaken the manuscripts which
    they found, started copying the forms of letters, et voila now we have the roman
    letter form. I&#39;ve simplified the problem entirely but you must see my point.
    Perhaps someone somewhere saw in a manuscript an illuminated letterform, liked
    it, assumed it to be of the Highest Order and thus most appropriate. More conjecture.

    and being on vacation I am away from my library. Off the top of my head the lettering
    on the church near Stephen&#39;s office is not a direct copy of any hand I can
    recall. I think there is more than a bit of poetic licence in that one; it also
    reminded me of some recent work I&#39;ve seen in Moscow.  <BR>I will be in Athens
    on Friday, so can have a look and try to see if I am mistaken and can find an

  body: 'The lettering is more Russian/Bulgarian than Greek. This is a style of lettering
    called Vyaz&#39;, which is often used in Russian Orthodox icon painting. It is
    ultimately derived from Byzantine Greek forms. The example Stephen posted is a
    simplified Vyaz&#39; typeface, adapted to the Latin script of course. Very often,
    Vyaz&#39; lettering is incredibly complicated, featuring letters of varying heights
    that interlock with each other or form ligatures. Here is a piece of Vyaz&#39;

    <BR> <BR>On a little side offshoot, I&#39;ve found this site that has some interesting

    <BR> <BR>As far as a tattoo goes, I would be very interested in something along
    the lines of the style John Hudson posted.  I only have to learn the language
    a little and/or get something to translate for the tattoo first. &#40;maybe I&#39;ll
    have it for the next TypeCon.&#41; <BR> <BR>I like how the interlocking sample
    that John posted has both a lettering and runic look to it because of its condensed
    nature.

    it into a more easily readable style, but there are several letters that I&#39;m
    not sure about. Also, the text is in Old Church Slavonic, and uses letters that
    are no longer part of the typical modern Slavic alphabets. I have a font in the
    ustav style that includes all the necessary letters, but as I say I can&#39;t
    identify all the forms in the vyaz&#39; sample: some of the variants are beyond
