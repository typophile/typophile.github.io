  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Sorry if this topic has been discussed to death before.</p>
<p>Typophile.com has a Type ID Board, which, I suppose, was designed to be the place to post Type ID Questions. Spam aside, that&rsquo;s largely what goes on there. There&rsquo;s also a General Discussion Forum and a Design Forum, where Type ID Questions appear rather frequently too. You can&rsquo;t blame the posters for that: the former Forum says &lsquo;Anything goes&rsquo;, and the latter deals with &lsquo;A to Z, and everything in between&rsquo;. Still, to some – at least to me – Type ID Questions feel misplaced outside the Type ID Board.</p>
<p>So how about moving the Type ID Board to the topmost place in the Forum Menu? That might be just the way – and an easy way too, I&rsquo;d figure – to have most Type ID Questions ending up in the Forum they really belong.</p>
<p>Best,
Bart</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To me the ID section is a necessary evil (at least on a relatively laissez-faire forum such as this) because otherwise <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ID requests would end up in General Discussion&hellip; So putting it at the top seems to make sense. However from watching the ID section intently for the past few weeks I can attest that: it&rsquo;s so busy that it makes the rest of Typophile look secondary; there are often quite shady font recommendations, which we are not even allowed to confront&hellip;</p>
<p>So I ask, what&rsquo;s worse: being mildly annoyed at seeing a misplaced ID request (and the ensuing awkward silence) which however a moderator -or other kind soul- can certainly help out with; or having IDs -and especially shady answers to them- take over Typophile (even more)?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my own &ldquo;solution chain&rdquo;: if we can enforce a ban on ID requests across the board, let&rsquo;s do it. If we can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t want to: enforce higher ethical standards in the ID section* and/or annex it so that: people who have a high regard for type designer rights don&rsquo;t have to watch; and people looking don&rsquo;t think Typophile is for bottom-feeders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Or at least allow people to have ethical discussions there.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, most people who use the ID section do have proper respect for type design. But those who don&rsquo;t sadly have free rein of the place.</p>

<p>You, sir, are prescient. :-)
Over the past 2-3 months I&rsquo;ve been injecting ethical considerations into the ID section; there are only ~3 people there who mind, but they can get quite vocal about not letting ethics cramp their addic&hellip; uh, lifestyle. One of them is a covert pirate, one of them is a &ldquo;your type IP is my type IP&rdquo; (AKA &ldquo;plagiarism is actually just inspiration&rdquo;) sort of guy, the other one is just a retired troublemaker. The rest are mostly decent folk though; some of them have actually adjusted their approach, I hope because they realize that Typophile&rsquo;s existence is tied into the creation of the things they so enjoy IDing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are other worrisome signs, for example that very few people who frequent the ID section spend any time at all anywhere else on Typophile, and that many people who ask for IDs never look at anything else even in the ID section, much less try to help anybody else ID a font; sometimes they don&rsquo;t even check back on how their own threads are developing -for example if somebody points out a case of plagiarism- once they have the ID. This is nothing short of parasitic.</p>
<p>Typophile&rsquo;s image has long been hurt by font IDs, and the belief that IDs are a way to introduce new people to the world of type is simply not borne out by what&rsquo;s happening on the ground. Overall I believe the ID section harms type design.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that&rsquo;s common at many forums.</p>
<p>I used to help moderate another group and what drove me crazy was when people said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time to check back for replies, please email them to [address]&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d delete the address and tell them that if they couldn&rsquo;t bother to check back then don&rsquo;t post questions.</p>
<p>I think etiquette in general is in decline. I remember many years ago when one of my professors invited a well-known designer from New York to speak. That guy was a class act. Flew in from New York, arrived on time, suit and tie, a well-organized presentation that was obviously customized especially for us, friendly and polite to everyone, and the next day he FedEx&rsquo;d a handwritten thank you letter to the professor. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t recall the guy&rsquo;s name, but to this day I remember his style and manners.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Patient Zero here is Slashdot, the tech site that pioneered one elegant way to police trolls: crowdsourcing. Slashdot has an automated system that randomly picks a handful of readers and gives them, for a day or so, the power to describe others' comments with terms like &ldquo;funny&rdquo; or &ldquo;off topic.&rdquo; Those descriptions are translated into a score from -1 to 5. Readers can set their filters so they see only comments with high ratings—and trollery effectively vanishes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Would such a system technically be possible on Typophile?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@John: Do you think people deliberately post their ID questions in another forum than the ID Board? That doesn&rsquo;t sound likely to me. If you have an ID question and you see there&rsquo;s a dedicated ID board, why not go there?
I can think of two probable reasons why ID questions end up in other forums: either the title Type ID Board is confusing, or the ID-forum is being overlooked altogether. Moving the ID Board to the top position of the forum menu would be an attempt to fix the latter problem. Renaming the ID Board, like others proposed, might solve the former.
Why not try both? Seems we already have some supporters of that idea.</p>
<p>@Hrant: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Ax (or offload) the ID section. End of problem. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Are we addressing the same issue? I started this thread because it bothers me to find so many ID requests outside the ID Board (not only in the General Discussion Forum or the Design Forum, but also in the Critique Section). How would &lsquo;axing&rsquo; the ID Section solve that problem? 
I think any type discussion board will always attract type ID questions – just like every city will attract tourists. Some people don&rsquo;t like tourists in their city. They will be happy if tourism is regulated, if the main sights are clearly signposted, so the tourists will easily find them. These paces will be crowded, but if you don&rsquo;t want to encounter tourists, you can just choose not to go there. Works better than enforcing bans, in my opinion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Making the ID section more prominent would make the whole of Typophile look more like a type ID service, harming non-ID activity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To me -and many others- occasional misplaced ID requests are a lesser problem than having too many ID requests (in the right place). One big reason is there&rsquo;s no easy mechanism for a user to shun the ID section.</p>
<p>Typophile should not harm itself to be useful to people who would never consider being useful to Typophile. In fact it&rsquo;s worse than not being useful in return: IDing too often comes from and leads to piracy and the promotion of plagiarism. Even if we&rsquo;re wise enough not to crusade against those, it harms Typophile&rsquo;s image -hence future value to type design- to play along.</p>
<p>To be fair, in the past few weeks things have gotten much better in the ID section, in terms of ethics. But it remains that the drawbacks of having an ID section outweigh the benefits, in my opinion. Based on my observations I have to conclude that the experiment (getting casual users to truly appreciate type via the ID &ldquo;gateway&rdquo;) might have been worth a shot, but sadly it failed.</p>
<p>Tourists aren&rsquo;t evil, but -due to the nature of most tourism- too many can very much ruin a city. I remember when I went to Moscow and Novosibirsk a few years ago: the latter is where I felt like I was in Russia.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you have an ID question and you see there&rsquo;s a dedicated ID board, why not go there?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Well, the &ldquo;why not&rdquo; consists of a couple of reasonable assumptions.</p>
<p>One is that people only visit the ID board if they&rsquo;re actively interested in helping others with type ID questions, since to do so requires an effort.</p>
<p>The other is that many people who could help ID the font in question don&rsquo;t have this active interest, but might passively respond to an ID question placed before them if they knew the answer.</p>
<p>If type ID questions could be charged for, like advertising, then at least putting type IDs in our face would help support the forum.</p>
