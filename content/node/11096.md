body: ' I am a third year Graphic Design student at The Arts Institute at Bournemouth
  and am looking for some help with regards to my final major project. The brief for
  this project is as follows: <BR> <BR>&#39;Examine through broadcast media the changing
  role of written language <BR>within the expanding digital world highlighting its
  inaccuracies and deviations from the communicative accuracy of the spoken language.&#39;
  <BR> <BR>Although heavily emphasised towards language development another major
  <BR>aspect is to highlight the development of the written word into more screen
  based solutions, in effect type for the screen. <BR> <BR>Any ideas, contacts or
  places to reasearch would be gratefully accepted. '
