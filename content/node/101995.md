    because texts are embedded as graphics and not as web fonts. For the rest, it's
    hard to tell which font it could be for such a small rendering. What's the sample
    origin website? Could be easier with more samples, larger or code."

    everywhere else. Knowing this, one of them could also have been used for the menu.
    Knowing this, I'm going for Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nEDIT: that's definitely NOT Gill
    Sans, nothing's really matching even considering the small rendering... I'm clueless
    at the moment. Reminds me of Neutraface (/E and /A low crossbars) but I really
    doubt it could be it..."
