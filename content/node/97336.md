body: "I'm creating a logo for an interior design/architecture company, attached image
  is one of my proposals, but the client keep telling that he need more elegant typeface.
  I've tried san serif fonts like gill sans and skola sans.\r\nWhat does he mean by
  elegant? is it like bodoni/didot, or some scripts or what?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_5327.png]\r\nhere
  is my client comment for this design:-\r\n\" Can try to add color yellow in the
  name HAITHAM JAFFER OR in TAG LINE\r\ntag line font size to be revised\r\ntry to
  change name HAITHAM JAFFER font to be more elegant\"\r\n\r\nAny suggestion for the
  font(preferably free)? especially something that suits interior design/architecture
  company\r\n"

  body: Your first task is to understand what he means by "elegant" and the only way
    to do it is to compile a list of options and see which ones he picks. For all
    we know he might be thinking something like <a href="http://www.dafont.com/dali.font">this</a>.

  body: Coming from a client, elegant could be almost anything. Definitely focus on
    what they are trying to achieve and how it fits into the brand identity they are
    imagining.

  body: "Like apankrat said.  You need to figure out what the client means; maybe
    show them some different font samples and ask which one(s) have the feel they're
    looking for.  \r\n\r\nOf course as the designer your recommendation may be something
    totally different than they have in mind, but understanding what they have in
    mind may help clarify how they view their company and the company's future direction."

  body: "> I've always been confused about the meaning of elegant\r\n\r\nWords like
    \"elegant\" can mean different things to different people. \r\n\r\nSame thing
    with color names. Google a descriptive color name (such as \"teal\") and you'll
    see considerable variations. If a client tells me they want a certain color, I
    pull out a swatch book and make sure we're both thinking of the same thing."

  body: "It's not as bad as that. Sure, ask the client for examples, but if you try
    too hard to nail down his terminology he's going to think you're dumb and/or insecure.\r\n\r\nBTW
    I need to add to my list: thin.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: But if you guess wrong then you actually are being "dumb". Don't try to nail
    down the terminology, just be sure you know what they are trying to communicate
    and really hear what they are saying to you.

    properly. In fact most clients are pleased that you want to understand them clearly.
    \ \r\n\r\nAnd it's better to spend 30 seconds pinning down what they mean instead
    than spending hours on a layout they won't like because you misunderstood them."

  body: "I guess it depends on how much the client wants the designer to follow directions
    versus doing some creative interpretation. I think the most fruitful client-designer
    relationships are founded on a sort of trust where making things too explicit
    neuters the positive potential.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "...and asking them for every single thing makes you look as if you're just
    creating what they told you. So they don't actually need you to charge them more
    than any school kid would to just put pieces together.\r\n\r\nA nice questionaire
    at the beginning with letter forms, shapes, colours is a nice test to ask them
    what they relate each of these shapes to? And then from their brief of the company
    get the actual liking what will fit their mind. While also giving you enough space
    of creativity."
