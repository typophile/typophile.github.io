  body: "That thread's about the current logo. I think kos is referring to <a href=\"http://www.logotypes.ru/gif.get?gif=Oakley%5Flogo2\">this
    one</a>, which looks to be based on <a href=\"http://www.logotypes.ru/gif.get?gif=Oakley%5Flogo\">the
    previous one</a>.\r\n\r\nEdit: those links should work if you paste them into
    a new browser."

    to be sure, you're asking about <a href=\"http://yellowsnowmn.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/oakley_logo.gif\">this</a>
    logo, correct?</em>"
