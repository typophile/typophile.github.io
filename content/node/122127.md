    \r\nSome of their fonts are at MyFonts https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Parachute/\r\nLuc
    Devroye has a very large collection of links to Greek fonts http://luc.devroye.org/greek.html\r\nDon"

    to be theirs. \r\n\r\nThe Luc Devroye collection is really extensive! But hard
    to look into every entry. \r\n\r\nI was hoping to be able to find it more easily
    with that distinctive \"x\", but I guess I'll have to give up..."
