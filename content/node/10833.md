  body: You&#39;re thinking of Marks of Excellence by Per Mollerup. Great book.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m looking specifically for the very latest examples of typographic logos.
    Preferably those which are, heretofore, unpublished.

  body: I was going through one of my collections of  gifs and jpgs I&#39;ve taken
    from sites in the past year&#40;s&#41; and thought this would be a good contribution.
    I can&#39;t remeber where I got it from &#40;either the designers site or the
    company&#39;s site&#41;. <BR> <BR>The designer has taken into consideration of
    how tech. will be applied to its application and taken it to the next level.   <BR>

  body: I do have the logolounge book, and am familar with their site, thanks. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m looking for examples that you all may have encountered first hand
    - logos that struck you for one reason or another, but not necessarily those which
    have been featured or honored by others. Secret gems that quitely go about their
    work without the attention of mainstream design media. <BR> <BR>Thanks
