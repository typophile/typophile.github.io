  body: "I hate to be a killjoy, but the fonts on Blambot are not FREE. Check the
    license. I'm sure it still says non-commercial work. \r\n\r\n(A few minutes later.)\r\n\r\nHere
    is the license downloaded with one of the downloadable fonts:\r\n\r\n<cite>These
    fonts are freeware for independent comic book creation and non-profit use ONLY.
    ( This excludes use by \"mainstream\" publishers, (Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Oni,
    Image, SLG, Top Cow, Wildstorm, Crossgen and their subsidiaries) without a license
    fee. Use by a \"mainstream\" publisher (or it's employee), and use for mainstream
    comics, or non-comic for-profit endeavors incurs a license fee be paid to Blambot.
    In Essence, this means:\r\n---- Anyone may use these fonts for non-profit projects.\r\n----
    If you are a self-publisher/creator you may use these fonts for any independently
    published project, for profit or non profit.\r\n---- If you are an independent
    publishing comics through a mainstream company (see above) there is a license
    fee.\r\n---- If you are not an independent comic creator and you intend to use
    these fonts in a commercial project, there is a license fee.\r\nE-mail Blambot
    for specific fonts' license fees, and for an invoice for your records.\r\n</cite>"
