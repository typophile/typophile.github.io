body: Hey, <BR> <BR>My boss is having troubles with her font managing software. She
  is using a G5 with suitcase and 10.3 fontbook installed. From what I can tell there
  is fight going on between the 2, and it involves the d.fonts. Any and all info would
  be appreciated about incompatibilities, resolutions to said trouble, and things
  to do to streamline the font management process. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Walt

  body: I think that you need to write more info about the &#34;troubles&#34;. <BR>BTW,
    I don&#39;t think that &#34;General Discussions&#34; is the right place for your
    question. Try &#34;Build&#34;.
