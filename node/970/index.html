		<div class="commentbody">Interesting thread. <BR> <BR>David, your questions are superb, and in part answered in the book &quot;The Alphabet and the Brain&quot;, which deals (in large part) with reading directionality (although left-right, not up-down). <BR> <BR>US books have the spine text going down while the European convention is up. No idea why. <BR> <BR>I prefer the right windows where the text is going up. Maybe it's the way different people prefer to tilt their heads? <BR> <BR>But also, I'd consider Steve's suggestion. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer the 'top-down' orientation. (I'm an American and a lefty, if that's relevant.) <BR> <BR>My rationale for my visual preference (beyond any theories about my physiological/ geographic biases) is in 2 parts: <BR> <BR>1) If I'm not mistaken, readers' eyes move across the tops of letterforms (lowercase), along with examining the word shapes formed by the acsenders and descenders. The top-down allows more air space (so to speak) for the eye to read the forms. <BR> <BR>2) The window frame acts like a sitting point for the type. To my eye (and therefore my mind), the type feels 'seated' on the left, as though it's using the wooden frame as a base. Its placement looks more considered to me. <BR> <BR>A caveat: upon second (and subsequent) glances, the righthand one feels more active to me, as though it's moving up, rather than sitting nicely still. If you're looking for a more active, irreverent, young, (blah, blah, you get where I'm going) appearance, the righthand may end up serving your purposes better. Use the potential difference from the 'norm' to your advantage.  <BR> <BR>Ultimately, I agree with Jacques' first post, just ask some people you trust in the office about it informally. (Just be careful, maybe some designer will want to use that orientation for your stationary&hellip;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good morning from Finland. <BR> <BR>Well, I am used to, left eye up, reading down. It also makes marketing sense if a book lies cover up to produce them in that fashion. At least some sense. Obviously it is not in fashion everywhere. <BR> <BR>However I don't think the window will often lie &quot;cover up&quot; as it does not have one. <BR> <BR>Mind you if the window went sideways it would not be a question. Or if it was, the question would be, should the sign read right way up, or, upside down? <BR> <BR>My advice however is to pick what you like the best as long as it is the window on the left. Left eye up, reading down. <BR> <BR>However I would remove those stairs because it will certainly be hard for anyone using them to read that sign. Also about my earlier observation, I would not make things easy for those folk that look in your window!! <BR> <BR>So that said. Ignore all of my previous advice and pick the window shown on the right. <BR> <BR>And leave the stairs where they are. <BR> <BR>? <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR>Lanston Type Company <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">there is a paragraph on Binding in 'Designing Books' Hochull, Kinross: Hypen Press. pg 101 <BR> <BR>it suggests if the spine is broad enough to have it horizontal. then goes on to say:  <BR> <BR>'If they are vertical, traditionally in German-language books text runs from the bottom up (except on large-format volumes that are laid front cover up in the bookshelf, so that the spine title can be read normally).

		<div class="commentbody">Vincent, <BR> <BR>For the most part I agree. But, more often than not, it is impossible to run the name of the volume horizontal. Also you probably can read the book title from the cover when lying down. A stack of magazines? The top one, stack of books the top one. But books tend to have more personality than magazines. Well. at least that's the way it was in my day. <BR> <BR>Besides, I do not subscribe to the theory that just because you are left handed, you are left eyed, or visa versa. <BR> <BR>Also I am not sure we can move our heads to the left or right any easier. My old noggin just gets dizzy no matter how I look at it.  <BR> <BR>Kids, be kind. <BR> <BR>I figure we just read from left to right. There are those that don't. <BR> <BR>If we rotate our heads to the position of &quot;left eye up&quot;, that eye is closer to the beginning of the text because it is up. If printed the opposite way, then the opposite is true. Unless we tilt our head the other way and theoretically all things become equal. Assuming, naturally, that the head is central to the text. Have you ever noticed how difficult it is reading the spines tight against the wall. My books closest to the wall left, I keep my books that are right reading upwards. My right reading downwards books I keep closest to the right hand wall. Try it, you will thank me later. Especially when you are as old as me. <BR> <BR>But, still we have those stairs, I think you may fall down if you choose the picture on the left, increasing liability insurance. <BR> <BR>So still, I stick to my position, at least for now, with sign as illustrated in the right hand picture. <BR> <BR>I think, it was the right hand picture.

		<div class="commentbody">Allright guys! <BR> <BR>Thank you all for your thoughts, it really is an interesting matter. <BR> <BR>This is how I decided to do it - in the middle left window, reading upward, aligned to the top right of the window. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14453.jpg" alt="MC signage"> <BR> <BR>Motivation: if you look on Google-images for conference stand, very large corporate banners etc, the all go upward. I do think the reason for this is the downward=negative and upward=positive explanation. I think the book spine is just a different discussion, although personally, being from The Netherlands, I am used to downward titles, and also the point that it's readable when the book is on its back seems logical to me. <BR> <BR>But since this signage is more like the &quot;vertical text on a big object&quot; matter than a title on a book cover, I choose the upward option. Also consider that the windows are very big, the text as you see it in the picture is almost 1 meter high! The alignment changed because think the text should have some ground under its feet, so its now grounded on the right side of the window.  <BR> <BR>Thanks for the advice and the food for thought!</div>

Also, in this case, the head is not central to the type. Making the beginning of the text closer to the left eye if you tilt your head left. The other way is not equal.

		<div class="commentbody">Another way to think about it is:  <BR>Where would one normally look for the start of the text?  <BR> <BR>On printed matter, the first place you look by habit is  <BR>the top. Text, whether it is right-to-left or left-to-right  <BR>goes top to bottom. So running vertical text down  <BR>from the top implicitly follows this rule.  <BR> <BR>Out in the world, everything starts from the ground  <BR>and goes up. There is no <i>top</i> outside to use as  <BR>a reference point, after all. So, text looks more &quot;natural&quot;  <BR>going from the ground up (or from the horizon up).  <BR>On the other hand, if the text was near the top of a  <BR>building, running down might be better. <BR> <BR>I guess my point is that it's more important where you  <BR>think the eye will go first and start the text there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">caspar, I think you've found the right solution! <BR> <BR>As far as titles on spines go, I just found the following bit in Marshall Lee's 'Bookmaking':  <BR>&quot;&hellip;it is a fact that italics and cursives are much more easily read from bottom to top. This position is actually less of a departure from the normal horizontal arrangement for them than it is for roman type, the latter being perpendicular to the normal angle, wheras italics are turned considerably less than 90</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, <BR> <BR>For the most part you design with rules. But the rules don't make the design. More often than not I would prefer the work of a non designer following well established typographical rules than a bad designer abusing them or working without knowledge. Admittedly however, some brilliant designs are successful by playing with, or teasing both the rules and their makers. <BR> <BR>This particular problem, I believe, has no traditionally established rules. Maybe one, running stacking type downwards, are to some, an offence. But this specific design problem has irritated many in the past. Solutions are only to be found by compromise of established reading habits and therefore reasonably, leads to, as we can see, &quot;individual&quot; solutions.  <BR> <BR>The &quot;individual solution&quot; is Caspar's, he is the designer, and he shows us his solution. <BR> <BR>And from what I can make of it, a good one. <BR> <BR>Now I could say what I would do, however that would be my solution, not representative of Caspar. His individual solution is of paramount importance. <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR>P.S. Hope you got insurance. I think when I fell I banged my head and now I am a nice guy. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>
