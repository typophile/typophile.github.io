    to wade through. I only hope this year&#39;s contest will bear similar fruits,
    and we see some design concepts not seen last year. Perhaps if we limit the number
    of submissions one can submit, designers will be more selective about what they
    send in. IMHO, Rich Roat <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2009.html">described

  body: Hey, I personally discuss <i>chocolate</i> on Typophile! Lettering obviously
    has a lot of synergy with type, even more than aviation has synergy with boating...
    So it&#39;s fruitful to discuss it, at length even. I do it myself, to the extent
    of the little I know about it. But discussion aside, it&#39;s not crazy to think
    that something as singular as a logo on a mass-produced t-shirt benefits by being
    focused on the topic. The two popular-vote shirts didn&#39;t have the superb execution
    of the jury winner, but they were more appropriate, more in tune with the entity
    they were conveying. <BR> <BR>I might be sounding like a fundamentalist, but focus
    in a visual piece is a virtue, right? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I was wondering why
    the jury chose a lettering piece. Because it was well-executed? Or if you look
    at the jury members, you might see a tendency to favor &#34;organic&#34; things.
    I love animals, but if you don&#39;t really like type that much, maybe you shouldn&#39;t
    spend so much time with it? John Downer for example is a highly skilled and talented
    letterer, and he seems to be increasingly focusing on that instead of type design.
    I still hope he has some great secret type design he&#39;ll spring on us &#40;I
    mean besides Paperback, which so far is disappointing&#41;, but if he&#39;s more
    in harmony with lettering, why force it? Focus is good. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Look, I don&#39;t know precisely why my design was chosen &#40;although I&#39;m
    happy and grateful it was&#41;, but there was nothing in the guidelines saying
    you had to use type. Other than including the name &#34;Typophile&#34; and sticking
    to certain practical limitations, pretty much anything could qualify. <BR> <BR>A
    purely typographic solution is an obvious choice for a Typophile shirt because
    of the general subject matter, but that&#39;s just one possibility. Why limit
    it to that? And, after all, the other one that was chosen &#40;which I think is
    a really cool shirt, by the way&#41; was an <i>illustration</i> and didn&#39;t
    have any more type on it than mine.

  body: The submitter&#39;s responsability is limited to the piece&#40;s&#41; submitted,
    not the <i>result</i> of the competition. The result is the responsability of
    the organizers&#42; and jury. As for the submission guidelines, I don&#39;t think
    it would have been smart to have a strict typographic requirement &#40;that would
    have potentially excluded genial non-typographic submissions&#41;, but maybe a
    nudge in that direction would have been helpful. I mean like in your case, since
    you make great fonts as well as lettering, it might have prompted you to submit
    a typographic piece instead, and it might still have won! On the other hand, such
    a nudge would have to be endorsed by the jury, and I&#39;m not sure they would
    have gone for it. <BR> <BR>&#42; To be fair, the organizers did a superb job overall
    &#40;as I&#39;ve said before&#41;. The only thing that was a no-no was allowing
    submissions from Typophile staff. <BR> <BR>&#62; the other one that was chosen
    ... was an illustration <BR> <BR>Yeah, but not of a dog or broadnib pen or a paintbrush,
    but of a <i>typecase</i>. Plus the original version &#40;which for some reason
    lost the &#34;California Job Case&#34; punchline&#41; had type in it. <BR> <BR>The
    kind of shirt I personally would have ideally liked to see chosen would convey
    the passionate and technical discussions of type that we have here. It&#39;s hard
    to do that without being trite, and I know that my own submissions failed pretty
    badly overall. <BR> <BR>All I know is, this is type-land, so the ideal shirt would
    be typographic. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    the only one to toss his designs into the ring&#41; - but since we are divorced
    from the selection process &#40;one was chosen by a panel of judges and the other
    by popular vote&#41; I see no harm in it. <BR> <BR>I think the trick here is selecting
    a shirt that looks <i>cool</i> and not <i>overly geeky</i>. The job case shirt
    has a nice ambiguity to it, so only type people get it. That said, I&#39;d say
    we&#39;ve shipped equal amounts of shirts - no one of the two is clearly dominating

    generally&#41; <BR>If you had a competition among a small, tight-knit online community,

    then the question of <BR>whether to include staff submissions wouldn&#39;t be
    an issue. <BR>The overriding factor would be, Let&#39;s have some fun. <BR> <BR>When
    you include big-name judges and cash and prizes, <BR>when you get exposure at
    major design portals, <BR>then you widen the scope and heighten the expectations.
    <BR> <BR>So Jared and Joe now have to weigh <BR>the joy of submitting and the
    competitive desire to WIN <BR>against the perception of wrongdoing should one
    of them win. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s a tough call, but it&#39;s easy for outsiders.
    <BR> <BR>Last year, this issue was discussed, if only briefly.  <BR>Because I

    <BR> <BR>Just to be clear, me neither. When it comes to Typophile, I have faith
    in Jared and Joe, otherwise I would mind that they are the de facto &#34;kings&#34;
    here&#42;. But you can be sure somebody will complain &#40;probably right here
    on Typophile&#41; and create malaise. <i>And again, for what real gain?</i> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>As for the &#34;just have fun&#34; thing, I guess there are different
    ways of having fun. Some people can have fun just organizing something like this
    and seeing it come through so well &#40;and I suspect J&amp;J did enjoy that aspect&#41;.
    You can&#39;t eat your cake and have it too. Sometimes, you can even enjoy just
    looking at how well the cake is made and how other people are so enjoying it.
