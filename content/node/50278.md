    (Scroll down a bit and click \"KLTF Transformer\" to download. Requires FLS 5.0.2
    Mac/Win.)\r\n\r\nAlso have a look at Christian Robertson's \"Interpolated Nudge\"
    <a href=\"http://betatype.com/node/18\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I know people
    who use both side by side."

  body: Thanks a lot Karsten Lucke. Could you please tell me how does one starts running
    the Glyph Transformer from within FontLab 5.02 after instaling it. I tried in
    vain to find out and did not succeed.

  body: "After installing, the first thing to do is assigning keyboard shortcuts to
    each of the three scripts, this is described on page 1 of the PDF (which is also
    in the zip'ed folder). In brief: For each of the scripts, first select the script,
    and then click the shortcut icon and select one of the shortcut places from the
    shortcut pulldown menu. In future, you'd access scripts only by shortcut. Use
    of the scripts takes three steps:\r\n(1) Select all nodes that should stay where
    they are. Then click shortcut assigned to \"Select Fixed Nodes\".\r\n(2) Select
    all nodes (like the other pole) that you want to move. Then click shortcut assigned
    to \"Move Nodes\".\r\n(3) In the dialog which pops up, use arrow keys to adjust
    the nodes you selected as \"Move Nodes\".\r\nEverything inbetween the \"fixed
    nodes\" and \"move nodes\" will be interpolated.\r\nThere are a few examples with
    screenshots for this in the PDF. I think the screenshots tell more than my description
    here.\r\n\r\nThis is the same as FLS's function \"Contour / Interpolate Nodes
    ...\". There however you need to drag/drop each node individually, while Transformer
    allows to adjust more than one node at the same time.\r\n\r\n(I have some ideas
    for more automatic bolding/lightening from a single master, but don't have the
    time to do this in the near future.)"
