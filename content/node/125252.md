body: I'm trying to solve a mystery regarding the origin of the bitmap font that later
  became Tahoma. Does anyone know how to reach Matthew Carter, the man who designed
  Tahoma, Bell Centennial, Verdana and many other fonts? If so, please forward him
  my email address or send me his contact information. Thank you. Sincerely, Tom Quinn

  body: Although Carter is the accessible type, what you're looking for is well-documented.
    He drew the bitmaps first (from scratch) then wrapped outlines around them. What
    "mystery" have you encountered?

  body: I ran across several documents dated in the late 1980's that appear to be
    drafted using the Tahoma font which was not officially released until 1994. Several
    older attorneys have told me that they purchased a software package for their
    Mac SE and early PC's that contained templates using Tahoma or its identical twin.
    I'm trying to solve this mystery for a client.

  body: If it is the same documents you've requested help on prior to this in other
    forums, please post something more than the word "Quinn". People who are trying
    to identify a font would love to see, for instance, lowercase letters such as
    a, e, g, k, r, y -- the more they have to work with the more likely it can be
    positively identified. Having a good amount of capital letters is also a big help.
    It also would be nice if it is a high-res scan (300 dpi) rather than a 72 dpi
    jpeg or smartphone camera shot -- small details can make a critical difference
    especially when dealing with sans serif faces. Last, but certainly not least,
    post it in the Type ID section -- not here.
