    Script]] by Dieter Steffmann but according to [[http://www.typophile.com/node/87248|Akira's
    expertise]] (and we can blindly trust him), Brock script is nothing but a rip-off
    mix of [[http://myfonts.us/td-orsjZv|Balmoral]] for uppercases (/M) and [[http://myfonts.us/td-7URLuw|Amazone]]
    for lowercases (/arc).
