body: Hi guys <BR> <BR>here is the new stuff i ve been working on. IFMSA&#40;international
  federation of medicine students associations&#41; ED will assist in diferent ways
  all over the world in case on an emergency or disaster <BR> <BR>the mission was
  to design a simbol that includes E&amp;D, i replace de ampersan with the plus symbol
  because it reminds me like a red cross but obviously with other colors. i use a
  simple language with the E and D and try to show a unified world for this cause.
  the letters are DIN from fontshop international beacuase i find it very transparent
  and simple thinking on the universality of the logo.  <BR>Once a have all done,
  the solution of the E and D remids me too much to the CE of the European Union,
  is just me or this means reconsider the logo? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26755.gif"
  alt="logo"> <BR> <BR> <BR>i also develop a poster to call for apllications, what
  do you think about it? <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26756.gif"

  body: cristian, this is a case where the context sure helps. i initially felt that
    your symbol was too busy &#40;and it certainly does contain many elements&#41;.
    but after seeing it on the poster i think it works very well! <BR> <BR>but i do
    think that if that logo needs to stand alone on a letterhead or some small mailer,
    it would be nice to have a version without as many words. the reason i think it
    works well on the poster is that the green bar and text become a headline to the
    copy of the poster. they&#39;re somewhat removed from the logo because of their
    function. <BR> <BR>nice.

  body: 'I&#39;m not convinced that the &#34;D&#34; is evident enough. You might need
    to somehow connect the &#34;D&#39;s&#34; stem to the &#34;&#43;&#34; symbol or
    some other alternative. To simplify the logo you could consider separating the
    elements of the logo and creating a style/usage guide to control their application.
    For example, the circular mark is either first read &#40;usually top right&#41;
    or it is incorporated into the primary graphic design &#40;as in your poster&#41;
    and the &#34;IFMSA-EMERGENCY &amp; DISASTERS&#34; is a tertiary read via positioning
    or size relative to the circular mark. BTW, where does 3M come into the picture?
    Are they the primary sponser? <BR> <BR>RE: Poster &#40;only read this if you care
    to read my take on it as a communicator&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;BE PART OF US&#34;
    works great graphically, but it reads funny. Some alternatives might be &#34;Take
    Part With Us&#34;, &#34;Come Join Us&#34; or just &#34;Join Us&#34;, &#34;Be a
    Part of It&#34;, etc'

  body: 'The logo: Nice. I agree that the &#39;D&#39; could be a bit more literal,
    but it&#39;s not bad as-is. The words circling the logo are a bit much and take
    it into the realm of some sort of &#39;official seal&#39; but maybe that&#39;s
    OK. <BR> <BR>The poster: Very nice, except that you need to loose the globe. It&#39;s
    competing with the logo as the central focus.'

  body: does the IFMSA not have an existing logo and/or is this green bar with the
    abbrev. it?  <BR> <BR>I ask because your explaination suggests that this ED unit
    is only 1 particular service or wing of the IFMSA - if so, should your symbol
    not include the real IFMSA logo so that the symbol your creating here will be
    the standard for all other dept or service symbols to follow.  - and then with
    that you may find that its going to get diffucult to design the ED part for units
    such as &#40;I don&#39;t know&#41; Nurses and Surgeons  - NS or Disease &amp;
    Research - DR. <BR> <BR>I think this might be what is the busy-ing factor - clarifying
    who the organization is and then what the service is. you have suggested ED twice
    - written and abbrev. - so this Emergency and Disasters seems to me the organizations
    primary purpose or even its name. <BR> <BR>I might say to  put emergencies and
    disasters around the circle and lose the fluff words - that way IFMSA stands alone
    and so does the circle - but they can be used together on top of each other too.
    <BR> <BR>or maybe I&#39;m way off - who knows.

    that i would need a less bussy version for other applications, i think i will
    use always the new version <BR> <BR>Scott <BR>I agree about the D legibility but
    i am not so sure that i prefer the corrected version i am posting here, i have
    not make a decision yet, maybe you guys can help me with that. BTW thamks for
    the text corrections, i will trust your intuition, because english is not my native
    language and this things happends some times, infact i like better the new call
    <BR> <BR>Darrel <BR>i delete the words, to much information for me. about the
    central focus on the poster i think the new logo helps on being more important
    than the globe <BR> <BR>Tanya <BR>you are right  about IFMSA, actually they have
    a logo &#40; <a href="http://www.ifmsa.org" target="_blank">www.ifmsa.org</a>
    &#41; but it really don&#39;t help with the concept i am working on here, maybe
    in a future i can help them on changing their logo. ED is a that, a wing and a
    particular activity of IFMSA, so i think you read it ok. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26792.gif"

  body: The new position of both the logo and globe definitely reduces the competition
    between the two. I&#39;m still not completely sold on the globe, though. I think
    the poster works great without it and the globe is maybe just a bit too much.
    <BR> <BR>The new logo...hmm...the old one didn&#39;t have enough &#39;D&#39; and
    the new one seems to have too much &#39;D&#39;. Can you drop one of the connectors
    in the D to the &#43; and still have it read?

  body: 'Christian: <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve done a really good job applying the recommendations
    from this critique. You&#39;ve made some great improvements. <BR> <BR>RE: Logo
    - I agree with Darrel, that connecting only half of the &#34;D&#39;s&#34; stem
    might keep it from dominating the logo. I suggest using the top half, as the bottom
    half may look like a backwards &#34;G&#34;. Also, the &#34;&#43;&#34; looks centered.
    Another way to decrease the dominance of the &#34;D&#34; might be to offset the
    &#34;&#43;&#34; to the right. Tanya&#39;s suggestion about the circling type helped
    a lot. Much better. <BR> <BR>RE: Poster - I&#39;m not sure that you have enough
    word spacing between &#34;BE&#34;, &#34;A&#34;, and &#34;PART&#34;, and then &#34;OF&#34;
    and &#34;IT&#34;. The space between &#34;PART&#34; and &#34;OF&#34; seems OK.
    The globe &#34;O&#34; works for me. The new logo definitely demands more attention
    than the globe, but I see a relationship between them that is advantageous. Because
    of the size and shape relationship between the logo and globe, it communicates
    to me that the E&#43;D organization is global. I assume this is what you intended,
    and I think it works. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

    <BR>I donno - its a toss up. <BR> <BR>I also just wanted to mention that your
    solution to un-busy things with the IFMSA on the circle too is just great. Its
    much clearer to see that they are the org and this layout will be ten times easier
    to apply to other units.  <BR> <BR>the symbol would make great pins or badges. '

  body: Was there an option C where the separation between the foot of the &#34;E&#34;
    and the lower buttocks of the &#34;D&#34; lines up with the &#34;D&#39;s&#34;
    stem? It seems like that solution would create an implied line for the lower stem
    of the &#34;D&#34;. Otherwise, I feel exactly the same about the two options as
    Tanya. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: 'The poster: Can you raise the logo and the text so that the reader isn&#39;t
    staring at the doctor&#39;s crotch reading the info? &#40;try shrinking the logo
    slightly in addition&#41;  <BR> <BR>Also, could you finagle the doctor&#39;s head
    so that it&#39;s not tilted to the side so much? He looks a little intimidating.
    I&#39;d shrink him a bit and move him and the green floor up so &#34;3M&#34; has
    some room. The &#34;BEAPARTOFIT&#34; needs to be taken down in size and spaced
    out better. Be careful. If you do shrink the doctor, try putting the URL on the
    top or just leave that blue space open. <BR> <BR>Good luck! This is nice. <BR>
    <BR>I think A works better than B for the logo. Scott&#39;s &#34;C&#34; option
    might have merit. I mean, he said &#34;buttocks.&#34;'

  body: 'Great job Christian! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious why the logo elements are weighted
    differently from the 3-color logo. In the 3-color logo, the &#34;ED&#34; is clearly
    the primary read, but in both of the 1-color logos the IFMSA and &#34;&#43;&#34;
    are the primary elements. For a consistent message, you might try weighting the
    background circle more heavily, then screening back the IFMSA and &#34;&#43;&#34;.
    The EMERGENCIES &amp; DISASTERS can probably be black. <BR> <BR>RE: Poster <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m still in support of the globe and the doc sillhoette. I support them
    both for primarily the same reason. The globe assures that you are communicating
    a global aid organization, which is a cool thing to be a part of. The doc might
    look a little intimidating, but to me, it&#39;s almost like looking at a superhero'
