  several years ago.  I know I used two different fonts and have already identified
  the first one.  Here is what I know:\r\n\r\nI first used it 3-5 years ago.\r\nI
  distinctly remember using a font categorized as \"handwriting\"\r\n\r\nI would love
  an exact match, but if that is not possible, I am looking for a font that:\r\n-has
  a larger upper bowl\r\n-crosses over the stem at all three junctures\r\n-has rough
  edges instead of smooth\r\n-has a comparable slope\r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/binquestion_5116.gif]"

  body: The K in my logo is in fact Rage Italic but the "B" is from another font and
    I am not sure which one.  I am positive I did not alter the letter, just used
    different fonts.

  body: "I think you nailed it with Mistral.  Looking at my logo vs. the gif I uploaded
    it is definitely heavied up.  Pretty sure I ended up with the font and the drop
    shadow merged together in that file.\r\n\r\nYou guys are good!\r\n\r\nThanks alot."
