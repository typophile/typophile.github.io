    at it as a chance to get some highly-coveted, well-designed, ultra-snazzy playing
    cards - <em>FREE!</em> Ya can't beat that."

  body: I dig the playing cards. The concept was indeed clever marketing, the results
    highly collectible and fun. I'm happy to see the folks at P22 taking it a step
    further and making the second edition an even broader collaborative project. Can't
    wait to see the new deck!
