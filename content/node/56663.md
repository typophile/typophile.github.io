  What is the corresponding meaning of Optical and Metrics that appear in apps like
  Illustrator or InDesign equivalent of FontLab? My problem is cos my font have manual
  kerning and when testing at any of this Adobe apps I see that when I set my font
  as Metric is looks good (kerned) but when I set it to Optical, some ghlyps overlap
  each other... :(\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!!!"

  body: When you set any of the Adobe apps to Optical it partly or maybe completely
    ignores kerning/spacing in the font, and spaces it optically. With Metric selected
    the app uses the spacing and kerning of the font. At least that's what I thought
    it did. :)

    in indesign or illustrator...\r\nso Optical is how the font looks like without
    any feature in fontlab? is the way I put my glyphs?"

    optical kerning is kerned how the optical kerning algorithm thinks it should be
    kerned. But it doesn\u2019t kern well enough to not require manual intervention,
    which sort of negates the point of using it. And it can be a disaster at text
    sizes."

  body: Well to my experience, optical kerning works wonderfully with Adobe 'originals'
    (e.g. Arno Pro, Chaparral, Adobe Garamond Premier, etc.). With other typefaces
    it depends. Sometimes you get satisfactory results, while with some others you'll
    have the kerning going absolutely bananas. I have to confess that I mostly use
    metrics kerning, and trust the type designer's judgement more than the application's
    algorithms.

  body: I've only ever used Optical for really large text. Or if I'm testing a typeface
    that does not (yet) have kerning. Then it can be a quick fix for testing purposes.
    But as James already said, it often requires manual intervention.

  body: I don't think Optical spacing will produce overlaps by itself, if anything,
    it wants to make sure letters never touch at all (like serifs between r and w),
    even where this would in some cases be desirable for better spacing.

  body: 'Maybe I should explain why I thought there were (maybe) problems with the
    side bearings. If you do all you spacing via kerning rather than side bearings
    and let your shapes go past the side bearings, that might overwhelm the logic
    of the optical spacing mechanism. '

  body: "In general, i prefer optical (= Indesigns interpretation) to metrics, if
    the font I use is badly spaced/kerned. With \"good\" fonts, I usually trust the
    type designer (metrics setting).\r\n\r\nAnd I like the optical setting for adjusting
    numbers of font that have only tabular figures. Optical always looks better then
    than metrics if used in text environment instead of tables.\r\n\r\nmikej: to turn
    off kerning completely (neither indesigs interpretation nor font designers kerning)
    you have to enter a 0 (zero) to the field. Then you get plain metrics without
    kerning."

    ability to get it right which mostly I do when I get a typeface from a respectable
    foundry... if however it is some what of a 'type designer in training' then a
    bit of manual kerning is required especially on headlines.\r\n\r\nOptical: for
    numeral (numbers) as on some typefaces seem to be a little out... Trade Gothic
    is a classic for the numerals being a little whack in my opinion."

    2008 issue of Step Inside Design had an article that included samples of House
    Industries' Studio Script collection. The spacing was completely messed up. I
    could be wrong, but my guess is that they used InDesign with \"optical\" spacing
    enabled. There's no way it was the built-in metrics. The letters didn't even connect
    properly."
