  do. Previously when I've printed it's been from large printing houses, and a couple
  hundred a pop.\r\n\r\nMy friend doesn't want to spend as much as a large printing
  house would charge, so can anyone suggest someplace I can get cheaper cards printed.
  They're only 2 colour and I've explained a cheaper place = lesser quality. I live
  in Toronto, but don't mind sending them out somewhere."

  body: "Haley,\r\n\r\nI've had many friends that need a business card - fast. Our
    solution: I buy cover stock #110 from Staples. I run it through 10 up to a sheet
    on a 4/c laser printer (Okidata) and cut (well, I have a person who does superb,
    accurate xactoknife slits....)\r\n\r\nIf there is a bleed - then we use an 8-up
    format, so we can give (till it) bleed(s)...\r\n\r\nThey go home happy - and we
    are cheap, cheap, cheap.\r\n\r\nAnd... yes, they look professionally printed and
    we receive many-a-smile.\r\n\r\nOr... you could go to Popular Printing in NY -
    fast, reliable, not expensive. Here are their business card prices:\r\nhttp://popularprinting.com/BC.html\r\n\r\nP.S.
    Ricardo - I just did check out where you asked - and boy are they expensive \r\n1
    color  1 side 500 cards $170 (and maybe a 10% off) (and they don't even quote
    4/c just 3/c 500 cards for $285)\r\nGuys I use - 4 color 1 side  UV coating applied
    500 cards $39 bucks - no discount...."

  body: "\"No business cards\" are better than \"cheap quality cards\".  Thermography
    is cheap and rightfully so. Real cheap.\r\n\r\nIf you are skilled, one colour
    business cards, top quality paper, (Hand made perhaps,) letterpress which is suited
    for short run work, would improve your clients intentions.\r\n\r\nOne of the most
    important aspects of a designers obligations is consulting your clients. And I
    should add, will help build your \"reputation\". Not that that seems important
    in this day and age. \r\n\r\nGiampa\r\n\r\n"

    did my own personal business cards that way, only I cut them myself, but they
    turned out awesome. The look the same as the last set I sent out to a professional
    printing house.\r\nI have a friend who owns a letterpress studio so maybe he has
    an easy way for cutting business cards already made. I'll look into it. "

    a cheap alternative I have found for my own business cards (and I've probably
    mentioned this in the other thread I linked to, above) is Avery Clean Edge Business
    Cards. 200 cards per pack, available for either laser or inkjet printers. Nary
    a rough edge in sight!\r\n\r\nMore info here: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.avery.com"

    really are a miracle of modern science, or technology: the sheet comes out of
    the printer, you fold it inwards along the edges of the cards, and you pop them
    out -- and presto! A co-worker saw them and told me that a few years ago these
    same Avery cards did have rough edges, and was surprised at the smoothness of
    the current ones."

    a better job cutting and it is much less expensive (I have a lot of friends....
    lol ... that need instant cards.)\r\n\r\nAlso Giampa - we have used Popular Printing
    for many flyers and business cards - amazing, but their work is fine. This is
    my recommendation when money for a client really counts. Take it or leave it --
    but it is very rare for me to make any recommendations, especially when it hinges
    on my reputation. Otherwise, for our high-end quality magazine, etc. we use a
    printer near Columbia, South Carolina. We've beat them up enough to give us the
    top of job we expect. Considering my husband has more than 50 years in the printing
    business, knows it inside out -- well, nevermind - to some of us quality still
    counts."

    stay away.\r\n\r\nIf you're printing your own, go down to Kinkos, choose the highest
    thickness card stock that will go through the printers, and print a few sheets
    with crop marks. An xacto and a straight edge work fine for low-runs.\r\n\r\n"
