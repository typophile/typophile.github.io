  way. I am looking for an alternative with a taller x-height and possibly a bit more
  condensed. Perpetua is close, but not a winner.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Sabon is a close match to Mrs. Eaves (or should I say Mrs. Eaves is a close
    match to Sabon). \r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/samples/emigre/MrsEaves.gif\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/samples/adobe/Sabon.gif\r\n\r\nLook
    at Monotype Sabon which is slightly more refined and narrower. I don't  have source
    to show you.\r\n\r\nAlso, just found Arena New by Gunter Gerhard Lange on Berthold
    site. It's got a larger x-height and more condensed than Mrs. Eaves.\r\nhttp://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90098.html\r\nThe
    sample is hard to review so I suggest downloading the PDF of Transitional type
    sample from their home page.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"
