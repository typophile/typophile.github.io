<p>1.Geulah:
&ldquo;Regarding the dagesh in the gimmel of geula, you might be right. Although you know, most dagesh is missing in modern Hebrew with nikkud, except for the beit, kaf, peh, and taf. The dagesh in other letters is merely grammatical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the last part. About the first part: not just right, let&rsquo;s see what your Rebbe said:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GeulaRe_5831.gif]</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Geulah_4154.gif]</p>

<p>Who is the Mateh Moshe?</p>
<p>This seems to be a clear souce for a gimmel degusha, a gimmel with a dagesh.</p>
<p>I found a few sources in the Amidah prayer, the Shmoneh-Esray, where Jews beseech G-d to deliver them from exile, and other places in the Jewish prayerbook.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/goalyisroel_6084.jpg]
.
.
To which Rebbe are you referring? A rebbe simply means &lsquo;my teacher&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t you know that? King David even called his enemy &ldquo;rebbe&rdquo;, just because he taught him something (Avot). The Lubavitcher Rebbe called everyone &lsquo;rebbe&rsquo;, except one person. He called him, &ldquo;hahu eesh&rdquo;, &ldquo;that guy&rdquo; to avoid speaking &ldquo;lashon hora&rdquo;, malicious speech.</p>
<p>Maybe, geulah has a gimmel with a dagesh, maybe not.</p>
<p>John, can you search your data base if the geulah ever appears in the Tanach?</p>

<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rebbi_4687.jpg]</p>
<p>.
.
In the Talmud, the person called &ldquo;Rebbe&rdquo; was a very great person. He was so great that we didn&rsquo;t need to say his name.</p>
<p>Among Lubavitcher Chassidim, the Rebbe refers to the Lubavitcher Rebbe, of sacred memory. But in each generation, the Lubavitcher Chassidim referred to their rebbe as the &ldquo;Rebbe&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe said about his predecessor and himself for a supporter of Lubavitch who no longer wanted to give money to Lubavitch, claiming that he knew the sixth Rebbe, but did not know this one, &ldquo;Tell him, we&rsquo;re all the same person, but just in a different body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which work by the Rebbe do you refer? Yalkut Moshiach U&rsquo;Geulah?</p>
<p>A &ldquo;rebbe&rdquo; in general refers to ones teacher, from the simple cheder teacher, to the esteemed rabbi who lectures in the advanced yeshiva.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See Leviticus 25: 24, 31, 48</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, do you know the Tanach by heart? Are these examples of the word &lsquo;geulah&rsquo; with a gimmel dagusha?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have my Tanach here. Can you scan the verses please?</p>

<p>My first response to Dr. Chomsky&rsquo;s thorough presentation of Rabbi Kimchi&rsquo;s broad knowledge of classical Hebrew Grammar, is that it lacks a comprehensive analysis of its topics, and a systematic presentation.</p>
<p>Who is writing to?</p>
<p>Peers, who appreciate his subject matter and array of examples, do not need a paragraph overview or two and a definition of a rule of the Hebrew Grammar that those examples illustrate.</p>
<p>I am a student of Hebrew Grammar. Not a peer. I seek a short overview of each rule of Hebrew Grammar. I would gain increased knowledge from a comprehensive analysis of its topics, and a systematic presentation.</p>
<p>I hope the other books suggested on this topic are not as limited as this one.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Israel, you may like Weingreen&rsquo;s <em>A practical grammar for classical Hebrew,</em> which is well structured and quite clear. Complex topics are followed by a summary, making it easy to check that you have understood the preceding explanations and examples. For example:</p>
<p><cite>‘Dagesh Lene applies to the six letters בגדכפת and, when inserted in them, hardens them by changing the sound from spirant to momentary. Dagesh Lene occurs in these letters at the beginning of a syllable, provided no vowel immediately precedes.’</cite></p>
<p>This still leaves some questions, but these too are clarified. For instance, if the preceding word ends in a vowel, will the gimel etc. at the beginning of the next work take dagesh or not?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the nature of the problem ( the book by Chomsky).  But the main question is: did you read/study Kimchi?  Because of you didn&rsquo;t study Kimchi how do you know what is wrong or right with Chomsky?</p>
<p>I think that I said that before. Don&rsquo;t look for How-to; read again the post by Bill about the kamats katan: with every rule there&rsquo;s a chain reaction!!! You can&rsquo;t just look for rules. You need &amp; have to study everything: verb pattern groups, the verb system, the noun system, pronouns etc. etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>That is why  I don&rsquo;t understand: &ldquo;Instead, David and I search for different examples in Tanach, or in rabbinical writings, to derive this simple matter.&rdquo;???</p>
<p>The main goal with &lsquo;your Rebbe&rsquo; was to save me time + words. BTW, the Rebbe is Shneur Zalman of Liadi. And you didn&rsquo;t answer my question: do you understand the Rebbe, the Hebrew?</p>
<p>What is the name of the siddur (year, publisher)? There&rsquo;s a problem with this sample; that is why I like to see a scan.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John and David,</p>
<p>Thank you for your advice and remarks. I think you, John, get the drift of what I complained about. David, you seemed to defend Dr. Chromsky by asserting that there is no simple rule, only chain reactions.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Many people believe mistakenly that the two-day High Holiday of Rosh Hashana is in a similar theme as of the other holidays in this season: remorse for past short-comings, and a firm resolve for a better future; blessing for a good and sweet year; a time to get closer to G-d; and happiness for the Torah.</p>
<p>Actually, Rosh Hashana stands apart, as it is not self-centered, and having to do mainly with us. Rather, the focus of Rosh Hashana is only upon G-d&rsquo;s role as king of the universe and every single living being in it.</p>
<p>In that way, Rosh Hashana is a universal holiday, which affects all humanity - perhaps, more than any other holiday (although many people point to Chanukah for its universal message of religious freedom).</p>
<p>The sealing of ones fate, so to speak, is about three weeks later, on Hoshana Raba. According to Chassidic understanding, based upon the teachings of Jewish mysticism, if one is not satisfied with the outxcome of G-d&rsquo;s judgement, one still has the opportunity to &ldquo;turn over the cart&rdquo; and earn remarkable blessings by dancing excitedly on Simchat Torah, as is the custom of Lubavitchers. We are never satisfied with whatever we get. :)</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Ktiva vachatima tovs - may you be written and sealed for a good year!</p>

<ol>
<li>According to the rule of Dagesh Lene pertaining to the six letters בגדכפת quoted by John, the word &ldquo;G&rsquo;alo&rdquo;, &ldquo;[G-d redeemed [the Jewish nation]&rdquo; preceded by the vowel &ldquo;u&rdquo; should not be with a dagesh.</li>
</ol>
<p>John, you referred to some problems with this rule. What are they?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>In my JTS English translation of Tanach, I don&rsquo;t see the word &ldquo;Geula&rdquo;, redemption, but similar words. chazar kushia l&rsquo;ducteh, the question returns. John, is &lsquo;Geulah&rsquo; &lsquo;גאולה&rsquo; as spelled, anywhere in Tanach? I don&rsquo;t think that I ever heard it in a quote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Rebbe, in Hebrew? I am unsure as to what you refer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Rabbi Scheur Zalman of Liad, or the Alter Rebbe, the &ldquo;old Rebbe&rdquo;, as Lubavitchers refer to him, or the Rav (as he is often called, because he composed a revised version of the Shulchan Orech, the Codes of Jewish Law), or the Baal HaTanya (as he is often called, because he composed a famous systematic work explaining the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov, composed many works in Hebrew. His most famous works are: a) Likutei Amarim/Tanya; b) Shulchan Orech; and c) Torah Ohr and Likutei Torah.</p>
<p>Are you referring to one of these?</p>
<p>If yes, I have studied them repeatedly in Hebrew.</p>
<p>His style is similar to the writings of Maimonides, in that he is both exceedingly clear, yet extremely concise, to the point &ldquo;each letter he writes is weighed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Like Rambam (Maimonides) in Mishnah Torah, Rabbi Scheur Zalman of Liady devotes much discussion and deliberation about the shapes of letters in a Torah scroll. Likewise, he was super attentive to the rules of Hebrew grammar.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michel,</p>
<p>Thank you for these five examples of the word, &ldquo;גְּאֻלָּה&rdquo;, &ldquo;redemption&rdquo;, each with a dagesh both in the gimmel and lamed.</p>
<p>This word, &ldquo;גְּאֻלָּה&rdquo; is not with a shuruk (with a vov), but with a kubutz under the aleph, and without a vov.</p>
<p>Hence, the correct way to represent &ldquo;גאולה&rdquo; with a vov, is to place a dagesh both in the gimmel and the lamed.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Geulah2_4104.jpg]</p>
<p>.
.
When I originally quoted this term, גאולה, I really wan&rsquo;t referring to any point in Hebrew grammar, or to its typical Biblical usage. Rather, I was referring to itsusage in modern terms, as the end of גלות, the 2,000 year old exile of the Jewish people, known as the גולה, the diaspora. By inserting an aleph, א, into the word, גולה, between the gimmel and the vov, the results are: גאולה, redemption.</p>
<p>This was in continuation to my quotation from the book, &ldquo;Letters of Light&rdquo;, which attributes Divine significance to the meaning of an aleph.</p>
<p>Our discussion was parenthetical.</p>
<p>Why is a vov included in the spelling of &ldquo;גאולה&rdquo;, and not without a vov, like the Biblical spelling: &ldquo;גְּאֻלָּה&rdquo;?</p>
<p>One answer can be like David&rsquo;s pointing to the habit to drop the vov or yud in words spelled with nikkud, and their insertion when words are spelled without nikkud.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest that here too the reason of inserting the vov is because of a lofty reason.</p>
<p>The Biblical term, &ldquo;גְּאֻלָּה&rdquo;, is different in its usage than &ldquo;גאולה&rdquo;, which refers to end of &ldquo;גלות&rdquo;, or the &ldquo;גולה&rdquo;. A vov refers to the concept in Jewish mysticism of &ldquo;hamshachah&rdquo;, a drawing down from Above to below, or how G-d illuminates this world.</p>
<p>If so, you might ask, isn&rsquo;t there also a vov in &ldquo;גולה&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The basic Chassidic belief from the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov is that even during this time of &ldquo;גלות&rdquo;, exile, G-d is with us in an open and revealed way.</p>
<p>We say this in Psalm 23:4-:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ps_23_4_4198.jpg]</p>
<p>.
Chapter 23:4
&hellip;ki atah eemahdee&hellip; for You are with me&hellip;</p>
<p>Atah, You refers to G-d directly, His very essence;
eemahdee, are with me refers to an essential relationship.</p>
<p>This shows that G-d&rsquo;s presense is not normally hidden, but enjoins a person, even in times of trouble.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I visited Rabbi Loeb’s grave when I was in Prague.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was told that in World War II, when the Nazis were leveling Prague, many non-Jews gathered by Rabbi Loeb&rsquo;s gravesite, for there was a tradition among the non-Jews that in times of peril, they should collect by his grave, as Rabbi Loeb would protect them.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>The oldest standing synagogue existed in Prague. I believe the Nazis destroyed it. It housed the body of the famed Golem, creatred by Rabbi Loeb, upstairs in the attic, among the shaimos, old books and manuscripts that contain G-d&rsquo;s holy name.</p>
<p>Once when the fifth Lubavitcher Rebbe, the Rebbe Reshab, was traveling, he took his only son, Rabbi Joseph Isaac, with him to that synagogue to pray. Rabbi Joseph Isaac was only a young boy then, and curious, he ascended the stairs to the attic to see if there really were the remains of the Golem there. After a short time, he descended with a scared white look on his face. The Rebbe Reshab took a very long time to pray the evening service. He then told his son: &ldquo;I had to turn around the heavens for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why did he say that?</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Many years later, the Nazis overran Prague, and invaded this synaggue. Two Nazis brazenly ascended the steps too, in search of the Golem.</p>
<p>One Nazi pierced his bayonet into the pile of old books and manuscripts, to show that no such Golem was there. He froze, and died on the spot. His colleague, the other Nazi ran down thesteps with a frightened, white face. He died a short time later.</p>

Apparently, the rule cited by John holds true, that the gimmel has a dagesh when it begins a word, but it does not have a dagesh after it follows a vowel.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this are found in Jeremiah 32:7-8, shown above, where the world &ldquo;geulah&rdquo; has a hei and a patach, or better known as the &ldquo;hei hayadu&rsquo;ah&rdquo;, when an object is singled out with the preface, &ldquo;the&rdquo;, as it is used in English.</p>

<p>The old Jewish quarter in Prague is very well preserved, Israel, as is most of the rest of the city. Prague was spared from major aerial bombardment during the war and, with characteristic perversity, the Nazis planned to preserve the Jewish quarter as a museum of the people whom they intended to destroy. There are at least two pre-war synagogues still standing, as well as the cemetery, and many houses and buildings where Jews lived, ran businesses, and met in the many philanthropic and devotional organisations. It is a fascinating neighbourhood to walk around.</p>
<p>[Another place of pilgrimage for every visitor to Prague should be the crypt of the Orthodox Christian Cathedral of Saints Cyril and Methodius. This is where seven Czech commandos, responsible for the assassination of the SS security chief Reinhard Heydrich, the &lsquo;Butcher of Prague&rsquo;, made their last stand against almost 800 German troops.]</p>

<p>Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi — Siddur Rabbeinu Hazoken</p>
<p>Kehot Publication Society:
“Compiled by Rabbi Levi Y. Raskin
Marking the 201st anniversary of the publication of the Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi‘s Siddur with this special bicentennial edition. A well researched, definitive and encyclopedic edition that offers citations and explanations of the sources and reasoning, behind Rabbi Schneur Zalman&rsquo;s rulings about halacha, prayer phraseology and pronunciation&hellip;</cite></p>
<p>I have an earlier copy of this, which I rarely use.</p>
<p>Most Lubavitchers use a weekday prayerbook, and a Sabbath an holiday prayerbook, called &ldquo;Tehillat Hashem&rdquo;. This, the Siddur Rabbeinu Hazoken, is purely a scholarly book.</p>
<p>The seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe himself used an older edition printed in Vilna, Lithuania at the Romm family printing establishment, called the Torah Ohy Siddur, which included the rulings and explanations of his scholar maternal grandfather.</p>
<p>Apparently, you are referring to something specific there.</p>
<p>As you know, Rabbi Schneur Zalman was a Hebrew grammar master, and sorted through seventy editions of the prayerbook until he composed his version of the Nusach Ari, the liturgy of the holy Ari&quot;zal. This liturgy is unigue as it parallels the 13th path of the splitting of the Sea of Reeds for those who do not know which tribe they belong to. The other 12 paths have been lost. The other popular liturgies were introduced relatively recently.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>At first glance, it will then be possible to determine a logical sequence for a kamatz katan, I think, but the sequence needs to include a multiple wild card.</p>
<p>In a CSUB string can wild cards be included, John?</p>
<p>If not, then a conditional set of strings can then be created.</p>
<p>My guess is this will be the case, then, for the hataf kamatz katan, and maybe even the shva-na and the meteg as well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see it unravel.</p>
<p>There is a very beautiful custom I learned among the Sephardic Jews to extend the customary greeting of:
l&rsquo;shana tova t&rsquo;katev v&rsquo;t&rsquo;chataym both on the first and second nights of Rosh Hashana.</p>
<p>Ashkenazic Jews do so only on the first night.</p>
<p>Logically, if we say that Rosh Hashana is one very long day, we should do so only on the second night.</p>
<p>In any case, the impact of this custom is that G-d sees that His children are united together, and like a parent towards children united together, this awakes His good will to bless them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David,</p>
<p>In Lev. 25:29, the gimmel of &ldquo;guelato&rdquo; (the last word in the verse) is without a dagesh, even though it is not preceded with a vowel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what a letter that has either a weak dagesh or a strong dagesh is called when it has no dagesh.</p>
<p>Earlier, I remarked on John&rsquo;s statement about the impact of a dagesh that a &ldquo;&hellip;“spirant” sound is soft, smooth, and longer, while a dagesh sound is hard, abrupt, and shorter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, a letter without a dagesh is &ldquo;spirant&rdquo; - soft, smooth, and longer.</p>
<p>John, what you are saying is that the sound emitted when a letter has no dagesh is different than a letter which has a dagesh, in all circumstances (not only in beit, kaf, peh, and tav).</p>
<p>For example, in Numbers 24:5, we begin &lsquo;davenning&rsquo; every day with the word&rsquo;s of Bilaam&rsquo;s blessing for the Jewish people, after seeing that their tents were assembled in a modest manner, with the openning of the tent not facing the openning of the neighbor&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<p>Mah tovu - how goodly&hellip; would be pronounced differently if there was not a dagesh in the teht.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mah_4395.jpg]</p>
<p>.
Is this physically possible?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Israel, you do understand, don&rsquo;t you, that the Tiberian system of nikkud preserves many distinctions that no longer exist in spoken Hebrew? The Ashkenasi pronunciation, which I believe you use, does, unlike the Israeli Hebrew, distinguish two pronunciations of Tav, with and without the dagesh, but not a difference in pronunciation of the gimmel with and without the dagesh. And evidently there was a difference in ancient times. There are many other examples. That&rsquo;s why this whole thing is so arcane.</div>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I disagree, based upon very simple logic.</p>
<p>First, in historical terms, many people use the past as a living lesson to learn from in a way that improves their lives.</p>
<p>As learning from Avot and to cultivate good midot is an important factor at your institute to become a mensch.</p>
<p>So, you see the past is a vital part of the future.</p>
<p>Second, the difference between the customary (often unlearned) pronunciation in Israel, and many millions of certain Jews in America, and an older manner of speech used by millions of other Jews in the whole world, is only at this time.</p>
<p>But, as they say, &ldquo;the times they are a&rsquo;changing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the words of our sages of blessed memory, we say every day: &ldquo;[&hellip;He] raises the lowly to supreme heights.&rdquo; Today, it&rsquo;s lowly and arcane, but tomorrow it will be lofty and significant.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s important to know both systems well. Hedge your bets, as they say. :)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the future of Reform Judaism. It&rsquo;s a factor to deal with today, but it may be less and less of a factor in the future.</p>

<p>It is possible to define glyph groups that can then be employed like wildcards in context strings.

		<div class="commentbody">The vocalisation of the Bible text as standardised by the Tiberian &ndash; i.e. Palestinian &ndash; Masoretes, represents the pronunciation as current around the 8th–10th Century, i.e. more than a thousand years after the last of the original consonantal texts was written. We know for a fact that this mediaeval pronunciation did not perfectly match the ancient pronunciation, because of those places in the text where the vowels do not match neatly the number of consonants, the most famous example being the vocalisation of YRShLM as if it were YRShLYM. As I wrote in one of the other threads, vowels are the most fluid aspect of language, both in terms of individual pronunciation and in terms of regional and historical variation. A vowel is a movement of air through the throat and mouth, and as such is much less precise than a consonant, which is a restriction or stoppage of air at a specific point in the throat or mouth. I remember reading some time ago about a linguistic professor who had trained himself to perfectly produce cardinal vowel sounds according to the open/closed, front/medial/back analysis of vowel sounds, but this was remarkable exactly because this is not how people normally talk.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michel,</p>
<p>You are living proof the the Talmud&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;ya&rsquo;ga&rsquo;ta u&rsquo;ma&rsquo;tza&rsquo;ta&rdquo; - if you really search, you&rsquo;ll find!</p>
<p>John,</p>
<p>So, the Golem&rsquo;s remains are still here with us. And I assume the ancient Torah scroll, I think one of the oldest, is similarly &lsquo;living&rsquo; proof of one of Masoretic texts.</p>
<p>I know that every Purim holiday, when we recite this passage from the Sefer Torah scroll, we &ldquo;read&rdquo; both versions out loud, even if only one version is written there.</p>
<p>About the wildcard searches, I will discuss with you by email what I have in mind. Actually, I want to use this feature in a few different ways, as we will discuss.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>In Michel&rsquo;s example, this is a strong dagesh, because most gimmels which follow a vowel do not have a dagesh. Usually, only a gimmel which begins a verse has a dagesh. Some gimmels that begin a verse do not have a dagesh.</p>
<p>What is a gimmel without a dagesh which begins a verse called?</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>On Rosh Hashana, as I recited in the prayerbook the holiday prayers, I noticed the appearance of the gimmel a lot, whether it had a dagesh or not, and whether it followed a vowel or not.</p>
<p>First, I noticed that in general the gimmel appeared with much less frequency that most other letters. Is this why its form is less significant (i.e. more narrow)? :)</p>
<p>Second, when any noun followed after a &ldquo;hei ha-ye-di-ah&rdquo;, a hei with a patach (eg. the xxxx), the first letter has a dagesh. Hence, even if the gimmel follows after a vowel, in this case it has a dagesh, and is not necessarily a strong dagesh.</p>
<p>In this second example, what is this dagesh called?</p>

<p>It seems that knowledge of kamatz katan, hataf kamatz katan, meteg, shva-na etc. is important to correct pronunciation.</p>
<p>It seems Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist etc. should teach their adherents these Hebrew grammar rules, and Hebrew type designers should include the glyphs for kamatz katan, hataf kamatz katan, meteg, and shva-na, in their fonts.</p>
<p>To do so, the Unicode Consortium should support usage of all these glyphs. Hence, not only should kamatz katan and meteg be supported, but hataf kamatz katan, and shva-na, should be allocated Unicode values as well.</p>
<p>Since we find multiple publishers using hataf kamatz katan, and shva-na, the Unicode Consortium has no reason to object to supporting them properly.</p>

<p>Thank you for this sample, and the link to the Aleppo Codex.</p>
<p>Are there similar links to other versions of the Tanach text, where one can view it in its entirety online?</p>
<p>Excuse my ignorance, but can you list the different versions, ages, and minor textual differences of the various Tanach texts?</p>
<p>Which one are the Dead Sea Scrolls most similar to?</p>
<p>I was told that no scholar has documented the differences comprehensively. Is this true?</p>
<p>Do each of these versions exist as Unicode texts? If they do, then to create a comprehensive chart of differences should be rather simple. Is this not true?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Israel, your quote is not from Avot proper, but rather a passage from Sanhedrin (90a), which in turn is referring to Isaiah 60:21, where your example of the shva na is from. This passage is traditionally read before studying a chapter of Avot.</p>
<p>I am really baffled by where you are going with these examples, and why you are asking about what Biblical grammar books say about them. Why don&rsquo;t you just read the books?</p>
<p>By the way if I&rsquo;m not mistaken a chataf kamatz is always pronounced as a kamatz katan, ie as &lsquo;o&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;a&rsquo; in Israeli pronunciation.</p>
<p>John, the changes from ancient pronunciation are not only in vowels, but also consonants. If I remember rightly scholars say that without the dagesh the &lsquo;beged kefet&rsquo; letters all had soft sounds. IIRC the soft gimel had the sound of g in George, the soft dalet the &lsquo;th&rsquo; in &lsquo;the&rsquo; and the tav the &lsquo;th&rsquo; in &lsquo;thin&rsquo;. Also the ayin had the &lsquo;ng&rsquo; sound, rather than being just a glottal stop, like aleph. Apparently Yemeni Jews still pronounce the soft tav with a &lsquo;th&rsquo; (the askenasi uses an &rsquo;s'), and Iraqis pronounce still pronounce the ayin as &lsquo;ng&rsquo;.</p>
<p>By the way, I suspect Hebrew would sound more beautiful if all the soft sounds were restored. Both Mandarin Chinese and French&ndash;to me the most beautiful sounding of languages&ndash;have no hard sounds (t, k, etc) at the end of syllables. They are also both &lsquo;court&rsquo; languages, whose pronunciation was I believe deliberately refined. Perhaps the same thing happened with ancient Hebrew, as letters at the end drop the dagesh, and so the sounds are soft&ndash;not fully closing the mouth and sharply cutting the sound, as in the English &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I am aware that this is not from Avot proper. Nevertheless, I decided to begin citing examples of shva-na etc. from Avot, I would use this Biblical verse, as many people associate this with Avot, as you explain.</p>

<p>I am no scholar of Hebrew;  I once had projects related to natural language processing but I have not worked in that field for more than 10 years, though we have a strong research group in that field in my department, the <a href="http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/"><strong>RALI</strong></a> (Université de Montréal). I am not qualified to tell you what is available and what is not.</p>
<p>I found some online resources <a href="http://www.bible-researcher.com/links08.html"><strong>here</strong></a>. If I just look at the various versions available on the mechon mamre site, the <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0.htm"><strong>Cantillated Tanakh</strong></a> is utf-8 encoded but is is made of about 930 different files. Other versions on their site are so encoded that I could find no way to produce a utf-8 text out of them. I have found no plain text utf-8 versions that are almost ready to compare.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><cite>I am really baffled by where you are going with these examples,</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of citing these samples is two-fold.</p>
<p>First, it is incumbant upon the Unicode Consortium to include the shva-na, hataf kamatz gadol, and the meteg used in nikkud texts (which may have a slightly different form than the meteg used in the Bible) as Unicode values in the next version of Unicode. I believe by posting the extensive use of them will influence the decision of the Unicode Consortium.</p>
<p>Second, I am a professional expert Hebrew typesetter. There are three other people that I am aware of that are also professional expert Hebrew typesetters. However, their knowledge of Hebrew grammar is poor. By posting these samples, I believe that they will be able to professionally typeset important Hebrew texts with these correct markings. As a result, future generations of readers of these texts will be knowledgeable much more than the sorry state we are in today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><cite>and why you are asking about what Biblical grammar books say about them?</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am trying to increase my knowledge of Hebrew grammar in order to program these Hebrew grammar rules into a large set of &ldquo;smart&rdquo; OpenType Hebrew fonts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><cite>Why don’t you just read the books?</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am currently studying the book on Hebrew grammar by Mr. Seow which you recommended, and on Biblical Hebrew Grammar by Prof. Chomsky based upon Rabbi David Kimhi&rsquo;s understanding.</p>
<p>John Hudson recommended two other books in particular by Joshua Jacobson, which I have, and another one, which I will have soon.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think there is such a thing as a hataf kamatz katan.</p>
<p>The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud|wikipedia article niqqud]] doesn&rsquo;t mention it, nor does Seow&rsquo;s grammar. But both of these, as well as my &ldquo;Ben Yehudah&rsquo;s Pocket English-Hebrew Hebrew-English Dictionary&rdquo; say that the hataf kamatz is pronounced the same as the kamatz katan. However, in the Wikipedia article they say that &lsquo;Tiberian&rsquo; pronunciation has a short &lsquo;o&rsquo; for the hataf kamatz. I don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s about, but in any case there is no &lsquo;hataf kamatz katan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I suspect that the the texts you show are simply making the kamatz larger in the hataf kamatz to remind people that it is pronounced like a kamatz katan. But it&rsquo;s always pronounced that way, at least according to the Israeli system.</p>
<p>I know that in Ashkenazi pronunciation, which I assume you use, all of them are &lsquo;o&rsquo;, and there are no distinctions in pronunciation between the kamatz vs the kamatz katan or hataf kamatz.</p>

<p>Michel&rsquo;s follow-up message showing the scan of the Aleppo Codex indicates that the gimel is missing in this source, while the variety of print editions I have based on the Codex Leningradensis indicate that it is present in that source.

<p>Have you ever seen in any literature about Hebrew grammar mention about a &ldquo;hataf kamatz katan&rdquo;, or seen a sample of &ldquo;hataf kamatz katan&rdquo; in any other book besides a Shay Lemorah publication?</p>
<p>William suggests that Rabbi Shmuel Winefeld made it up, because there is no Wikipedia article about it yet, nor does Mr. Eliezer Ben Yehuda doesn&rsquo;t mention it in his “Ben Yehudah’s Pocket English-Hebrew Hebrew-English Dictionary”.</p>
<p>If you placed Rabbi Shmuel Winefeld on one side of the scale, and then you placed Mr. Eliezer Ben Yehuda, the father of modern Hebrew, upon the other side of the scale, who pray tell would outweigh the other?</p>
<p>Are the writings of the Rishonim available to read in the original, I assume, Hebrew? I am sure JTS has them to review and make photo-copies. Do you know their names and authors? I&rsquo;m talking about Rabbi David Kimchi&rsquo;s sources.</p>

<p>Three times it&rsquo;s spelled as in the Long Blessing After Eating Kinds of Special Fruit, Cake, or Wine, with a &ldquo;hataf kamatz katan&rdquo; (twice with a hei and dagesh, and once with only an ordinary hei with a makef or rafe over it).</p>

<p>I grew up as a kid with an ordinary memory. I didn&rsquo;t remember where I put the keys a half hour ago. I couldn&rsquo;t recall my cousin&rsquo;s name, and I just saw him a few months before.</p>
<p>But after I became a Chassidic Jew in my early twenties, I was advised to compose a monthly report to the Lubavitcher Rebbe, which I concluded by asking for his blessing to succeed in learning Torah.</p>
<p>The blessing was fulfilled as I gained a remarkable memory too, like you, for success in learning is aided by a great memory.</p>
<p>Anyway, I fasted earlier, and am hungry now. Anyone want some cheesecake? :)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that Bill is wrong.  A hataf kamats is also a kamats katan, an &ldquo;o&rdquo; (in short: the kamats was an &ldquo;a&rdquo; &ndash; e.g. katal + an &ldquo;u&rdquo; &ndash;e.g.  kul -&gt; kol. when the pronunciation was an &ldquo;a&rdquo; or an &ldquo;o&rdquo; (kamats hatof/hataf kamats )?  your origin, area.</p>
<p>Short history: back&hellip;. the old days the  kamats katan was tsere; also kamats katan with two dots was tsere. kamats —  kamats gadol or wide;  patah — patah gadol; segol — patah katan.</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>I hear your view and read your historical precedences. But Winefeld published in his books both a &ldquo;kamatz katan&rdquo; and a &ldquo;hataf kamatz katan&rdquo;, too. So, in his mind, &ldquo;hataf kamatz katan&rdquo; must serve a different purpose.</p>
<p>He must have something in mind. Plus, knowing his mentality as a heredi scholarly rabbi, he must have a strong source in the writings of early Rishonim to hold his view and publicize it. Plus, did you see the list of endorsees he has for his works? Eliezer would hide under his couch (if he could fit) and hide out of shame. :)</p>

<p>I would like to present a scan of what you have, and a scan of a Shay LeMorah sample to the Unicode consortium, so that Unicode values will be added for these two glyphs. Then, in the future these two symbols can be inserted into Unicode Hebrew data files of Tanach and other texts.</p>

<p>William,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><cite>Did Rabbi Winefeld distinguish between a “hataf kamatz” and a “hataf kamatz katan”?</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, in different books Rabbi Winefeld published texts that had both “hataf kamatz” and “hataf kamatz katan” and &ldquo;shva-na&rdquo; graphic symbols. He did this intentionally. He invested money into a custom-made TrueType font that included these glyphs as separate entities.</p>
<p>Your explanation does not address this possibility.</p>
<p>My guess is if we sort through early writings from the early Rishonim about the nuances of Hebrew grammar, we will find a discussion of this aspect of Hebrew speech. If so, it becomes just as valid and significant as &ldquo;zei a mensch&rdquo;, the importance of maintaining a Jewish standard. One aspect is behavioral, and another is verbal.</p>

<p>His 10 year old daughter served a steaming bowl of chicken soup with a puffy matzah ball one Friday night. The rabbi eyed how I delighted slupping it up. He commented, &ldquo;If the discussions of Judaism don&rsquo;t bring a Jew closer to practicing Judaism, the chicken soup on Friday night will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Rochester, NY, the Chabad House had a small but very popular &ldquo;Beginner&rsquo;s Service&rdquo; each Saturday morning. Many members of the large nearby Reform temple snuck away from the weekly services to join the Chabad House &lsquo;minyan&rsquo; just before its conclusion, to participate in the &ldquo;hot&rdquo; kiddush. While the Reform members were munching on some warm delicious kugel, the rabbi remarked: &ldquo;Some people become more observant because of seeing Chassidic joy, some people become more observant because of learning profound ideas in Judaism, but others become more observant because of warm kugel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My kugel is calling. :)</p>
<p>Shabbat Shalom!</p>

<p>Note the small asterisk to indicate a shva na in the Lubavitch publications, and the short vertical line in the ArtScroll books.

<p>Your posting is from Kehot of Israel.</p>
<p>My two postings are the original and the Otzar edition. The original was pasted together from many older prayerbooks to avoid copyright infringement; hence, it features many many different versions of the traditional &ldquo;siddur&rdquo; typeface. The Otzar was made to be its clone, like Windows is a clone of Macintosh (which is a clone of Xerox, which is a clone of John Warnock&rsquo;s brain&hellip;).</p>
<p>I will try to locate the missing Kehot of New York version, newly typeset. The director thinks no one knows what a shva-na is, and reduced the size of the asterisk to very very very small. (The Rebbe never liked Yossi as head of Kehot - I never said that.)</p>
<p>John, if we don&rsquo;t do something, people will speak of dinasaurs and shva-nas in the same breath. Can&rsquo;t Unicode spare a few code values?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Nancy, the shva-na walked the earth over two billion years ago. It descended from a wild boar, or ape, or something&hellip;uh, uh&hellip;wild cow. Yeah, that&rsquo;s it. Phhh, now that&rsquo;s kosher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is this accurate?</p>
<p>If so, one simply can search this sequence chaf-kamatz-lamed-space or khaf-kamatz-lamed-space and replace it with chaf-kamatz_katan-lamed-space or khaf-kamatz_katan-lamed-space, or just build this GSUB directive into the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; OpenType Hebew font. Right?</p>

<p>Currently, there is no Unicode value for shvana. So, when I add these glyphs to data files using InDesign ME, a different Unicode value is actually added instead.</p>
<p>So, later, after the Unicode Consortium adds a shvana to the Hebrew section of values, I will have to search and replace these additions which I made to the data files, and also repeat this glyph in the font, once with the original fake Unicode value, and again with the new true Unicode value.

<p>For example, most Hebrew words contain three root-letters. Each root-letter belongs to different group of letter types.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There appears to be specific patterns among different kinds of Hebrew words, when contructed in the same manner (meaning: with the same sequence of nikkud), then the first shva always becomes a shvana.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;hei yediya&rdquo; is a pronoun, like the preposition in English, the, as in &ldquo;the rain in Spain&rdquo;. In Hebrew, the preposition, the, is a single letter, hei (usually with a patach), and is attached to the noun following it (hence, its a pronoun). When that noun begins with a letter and a shva, then a shvana symbol is added in order to indicate to the reader that it should be pronounced as a shvana.</p>
<p>This is something that can simply be programmed into a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; OpenType font with the GSUB routine for automatic replacement, like what John Hudson did in SBL-Hebrew for the furtive patach.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/samples_ha_shvana_4928.jpg]</p>
<p>As we discover and define all the other kinds of patterns which produce a shvana, then these become a list of rules to program into OpenType.</p>
<p>David, do you think it&rsquo;s possible now?</p>
<p>This then can be done for the kamatz katan, etc., with G-d&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>Can this be done with the taamim and nikkud to decipher the rules for the taggim as well?</p>

<p>In your example above, you show how the Kehot editor (the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe or one of his ancestors) and the Shay Lemorah editor (Rabbi Shmuel Yehuda Winefeld Shlita) mark differently the word, &ldquo;u&rsquo;v&rsquo;shachbacha&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This word either has two shvanas, like the Kehot example (the first and third shva), or it only has one shvana, like Shay Lemorah (only above the third shva).</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uvshachbecha_shvana_6537.jpg]</p>
<p>Notice that the Kehot example does not acknowledge the kamatz katan. The Shay Lemorah example does mark it (under the shin).</p>
<p>Perhaps, this is a key to the difference.</p>

<p>Clearly, the exception to this rule is when the first letter is a yud.</p>
<p>As an aside, much discussion is devoted to a word which begins with a yud in Jewish mystical literature, indicating its special status.</p>
<p>For example, G-d&rsquo;s holiest name begins with a yud. The form of each letter is made from the shape of the yud. Although it is the smallest letter in size, it is (its gematria) represents the structure of every being (ten sephirot).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David,</p>
<p>I started at the first page of the Kehot daily siddur, because it was more comprehensive in its text than Shay Lemorah books. I didn&rsquo;t have many ArtScroll books about me, as I am a Chabadsker and use Kehot books more.</p>
<p>I looked for different kinds of words, beginning with a letter and a particular nikkud, and then in second slot, another letter with a shva, and an asterisk on top of the second letter to indicate that it was a shva-na.</p>
<p>I categorized the different kind of words into groups. So far I presented three kinds: 1) a letter with a chirik first, followed by a second letter and a shva(-na); the exception was when the first letter was a yud; 2) a shuruk first, and then a second letter with a shva(-na); I didn’t find any exceptions; and 3) the first of a letter pair was an ayin and a patach, followed by the second part of the pair, a letter with a shva(-na).</p>
<p>If you feel that these examples are not right, I did not err, the editor of the Kehot prayerbook differs with you. I believe that was the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, or one of his predecesors.</p>
<p>BTW, I am showing these preliminary samples to Prof. Aron Dotan for his feedback, too.</p>
<p>I do not understand how you can differ with authorities much greater than you. Your understanding must be based upon a different set of rules. A forth&hellip; :)</p>
<p>Seriously, so far, the pattern of shva-na in the Kehot prayerbook is very logical.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t address books. I bought a few books, and am studying them, although they are far from systematic in their presentation or analytical. Prof. Chomsky&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;R. D. Kimchi&rsquo;s Hebrew Grammar&rdquo;, and C. L. Seow&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;A Grammar for Biblical Hebrew&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I simply reported my findings from the Kehot prayerbook, and books by Shay Lemorah, which for my purpose did not address grammatical rules or logical rules, but simply found groups of similar patterns.</p>
<p>The GSUB routine is a simple search and replace feature built into &ldquo;smart&rdquo; OpenType fonts. I am addressing shva-na as strings to be searched and replaced.</p>
<p>Are shva-nas affected by the taamim/cantillation marks, as you suggest? I haven&rsquo;t seen evidence of this.</p>
<p>Please cite examples where the same verse which has or has not a shva-na is affected by having taamim, to the point that a shva becomes a shva-na, or a shva-na becomes a shva.</p>
<p>As everyone is free to come and go as they wish, but if one sincerely values the subject, and is in the position to contribute, it would seem selfish not to participate intentionally.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our sages obm warn in the Chapters of the Father: &ldquo;Lo habayshan yilamed&rdquo; - &ldquo;one who refrains from asking or teaching in turn fails to learn more&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Israel, the Seow book is quite systematic and analytical, so I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about. I share David&rsquo;s bafflement. Here on p. 10 are the four rules for when a shva is vocal:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is at the beginning of a word&hellip;</li>
<li>It is the second of two, in immediate succession&hellip;</li>
<li>It comes immediately after a strong dagesh&hellip;</li>
<li>It comes immediately after a long vowel&hellip;</li>
</ol>
<p>I have put ellipses in place of the Hebrew examples, but that&rsquo;s the full content of the four rules.</p>
<p>Now the complication is when the dagesh is strong or weak, and whether the preceding vowel is long or short. And whether the dagesh is strong or weak is also influenced by whether the vowel previous to it is long or short, according to Seow.</p>
<p>Thus the big issue is when a vowel is long or short. And this cannot be told from syntax alone&ndash;from the string of letters&ndash;because the vowel is always long if it is on an accented syllable, according to Seow. And syntax does not indicate accent.</p>
<p>Now according to Chomsky, the division of vowels into short and long was an innovation of the Kimhi family, and it seems to be a real question as to whether this ever really existed before. Evidently you can ascertain whether something is a schva na with a dictionary look up system, and a dictionary that gives you the correct accents. But it is not a matter of syntax alone.</p>
<p>Now if the Lubovicher Rebbe #7 had a different system, that is a different matter. Either he had another system and rationale, in which case you ought to be able to ask someone, or he just got it wrong.</p>
<p>If you find out the Lubovicher system, it looks like that is only going to be for setting type for Lubovichers like yourself. That seems to me very limited, but if you want to do it, that&rsquo;s fine. Just don&rsquo;t imagine that it&rsquo;s either the Kimhi system or modern.</p>
<p>As I said, my own conclusion in all this is just to go with the modern system, as explained by Chomsky. For there is no certainty at all about whether the Kimhi system is a correct view of the Tiberian system of nikkud, and now Hebrew is a living language. In anyone&rsquo;s memory of a century ago, both Ashkenazi and Sfaradi pronunciation followed the modern rules, according to Chomsky.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I was refering to the other book.</p>
<p>Seow&rsquo;s book is very good. It&rsquo;s aimed to teach. His chapters are called &ldquo;Lessons&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the Talmud, there are basic commentaries after one studies Rashi and Tesephot. One is called, Meharsha. Under his commentary is Chochmat Shlomo and Maharam.</p>
<p>I recall that I asked my teach about 30 years ago about the ease to read the understand the questions of Chochmat Shlomo, while Maharam was difficult to read, as his remarks were often cryptic.</p>
<p>My teacher explained to me that Chochmat Shlomo was a teacher, and experienced at wording complicated matters in a way that is easy to understand.</p>
<p>I think that this is similar to a difference in Seow&rsquo;s and Chomsky&rsquo;s books.</p>

<p>Apparetly, there are at least different methods to determine when a shva should a shva-na. This is (only) one method. There are two different methods.</p>
<p>I tried to express this earlier a few times.</p>
<p>As proof to this, we find different book publishers who identify a shva-na. Each mentions the source for their decision-making process. The results are different, too.</p>
<p>In the books from Kehot of USA, used by hundreds of thousands of people every day, one method is used, based upon the Rishonim, early post-Talmud scholars.</p>
<p>In the books from ArtScroll, also used by other hundreds of thousands of people every day, a different method is used, by the later authorities, Ibn Ezra (12th century) and Vilna Gaon (19th century).</p>
<p>In the books from Shay Lemorah, used by less than a hundred thousand people, a third method is used, by &ldquo;early Rishonim and Minchat Shai).</p>
<p>When David remarked that my examples of shva-na were incorrect, he failed to cite support or produce visible examples. Tonight, when I recited the Havdallah prayer, I used a booklet from Shay Lemorah. I noticed that the booklet was different that the Kehot rules I cited earlier. This is likely what David saw too.</p>
<p>Instead of concluding that it&rsquo;s wrong, I say that it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Apparently, if you apply 3 different sets of rules of shva-na, the same verses will look differently: each will identify a different number of shva-nas.</p>

<p>I think that this is whay confused me earlier when reading his book on David Kimchi&rsquo;s Hebrew Grammar.</p>
<p>Did Chomsky, the great scholar and grammartarian, simply translates Kimchi&rsquo;s work (a great feat in itself), or introduce something innovative unique to Chomsky? It seems that it&rsquo;s the former, and not the latter.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in your reading of both books, you see a difference in the way that they understand rules of Hebrew grammar.</p>

<p><cite>&hellip;if the Lubovicher Rebbe #7 had a different system&hellip;</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rabbi M.M. Schneersohn, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, did not have any different system. No one has introduced a new meaningful system since the &ldquo;Age of Hebrew Grammar&rdquo;, as Chomsky calls it.</p>
<p>Rabbi Schneersohn was appointed by the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, his predecesor, to direct Kehot. Hence, he was likely responsible for editing its expanded prayerbook.</p>
<p>The fifth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, actually introduced a short version of this payerbook, together with other popular prayerbooks (of other nusachs), at the beginning of the 20th century, when they were in short supply after WWI.</p>
<p>Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liady, the first Lubavitcher Rebbe, actually produced the famous Nusach Ari prayerbook, based upon comparisons of many different prayerbooks, and incorporating certain rules of Hebrew grammar.</p>
<p>The system used by Kehot is based on his decisions.</p>
<p>The first Lubavitcher Rebbe was a contemporary of Vilna Gaon. Our understanding of the universe and the soul is from Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liady&rsquo;s explanations of the Baal Shem Tov&rsquo;s teachings of the Arizal&rsquo;s understanding. Vilna Gaon&rsquo;s explanations are no longer understood, and hence irrelevant.</p>

<p>I typeset for everybody. Your assumption is simply assumption.</p>
<p>I have seem no evidence that there is any new system.</p>
<p>The issue is to make existing Unicode data of the Tanach appear with a shva-na etc. automatically, so readers can pronounce words correctly, students can learn what these symbols are, and why they appear.</p>

<p>I am confused.</p>
<p>The Tiberius system is our source for the nikkud, right. How old is it? (Could you post a link to a good explanation of it.)</p>
<p>Kimchi is a presentation of the understanding of his predecessors about this system, with some contraversial elements. From about 800 years ago or less.</p>
<p>Chomsky is a scholar from the fifties, who presented Kimchi in English. That&rsquo;s less than sixty years ago.</p>
<p>Then, in modern Israel, Ashkenazic Jews adopted Sephardic pronounciation, because the Israeli government chose to standardize on one way to pronounce words.</p>
<p>They are two separate issues. Unrelated.</p>
<p>As I understand it, modern Hebrew pertains to vocabulary alone. New words were introduced for objects and activities that did not exist earlier. There is only one form of Hebrew grammar. (I don&rsquo;t even get how Biblical Hebrew grammar differs from Hebrew grammar, if it does.)</p>
<p>They are two separate issues. Unrelated.</p>

<p>I did a bit of research on Chomsky.</p>
<p>Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Chomsky">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Chomsky</a> says: William Chomsky (1896-1977) was an American scholar of Hebrew, born in Ukraine, who was a professor at Gratz College. He was made faculty president of Gratz in 1932, a position that he held for thirty seven years. He also taught at Dropsie College, a graduate school of Jewish and Semitic studies. from 1955 until 1977. He was a renowned specialist of the history of the Hebrew grammatical tradition, before and after David Kimhi (1160–1235). His obituary (New York Times, 22 July 1977) describes him as &ldquo;one of the world&rsquo;s foremost Hebrew grammarians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a great Hebrew grammar scholar, but not another Kimchi. You just like him because his name was William, and he taught at Gratz College.</p>

<p>The first 14 pages of MY Seow&rsquo;s book doesn&rsquo;t mention anything about shva-na, except on page 10. Please scan the page you have, if it&rsquo;s different than mine.</p>
<p>Seow only mentions the 4 rules you cited earlier.</p>
<p>Remember, with all due respect to the science of Hebrew grammar, my intentions are definitions which can be searched and replaced. Period.</p>
<p>It seems that you and David are not thinking &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;. Perhaps, when people are not &ldquo;frum&rdquo;, they are not flexible either.</p>
<p>In OpenType, a string can be substituted for a different string using the GSUB routine and MS Volt. Then, existing data without that special character in the string can appear automatically, as John Hudson accomplished in SBL-Hebrew with the furtive patach.</p>

<p>You appear to distinguish between Kimchi-esque Hebrew grammar based upon Hebrew sequences divided by having long or short vowels, and spoken Hebrew grammar based upon no special distinction.</p>
<p>It seems that you&rsquo;re saying that Chomsky and Seow follow down the path that Kimchi tread down.</p>
<p>Finally, you conclude that there is such a thing as Mishnaic Hebrew Grammar and Biblical Hebrew grammar, because non-punctuated Scripture used the letter vov more often that the Mishna, which was punctuated.</p>
<p>You might be correct in your understand of these issues, but I think not.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the way non-traditional Bible scholars tried to suggest that G-d was represented in the Bible with different names, because at different periods of time people related to G-d differently, by different names.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice fairy tale, like the earth being billions of years old, had cold blooded dinasurs the size of tall building&hellip;now, the fairy tale is warm-blooded, and even taller, or shorter, depending upon the expert &ldquo;scientist&rdquo; you ask.</p>

<p>The last two rules need to be linked to other rules to get the full picture.</p>
<p>If you go through the chain of links, to the issue of the strong and weak dagesh and long and short vowels, you will understand it. If you won&rsquo;t take the trouble to study it, you won&rsquo;t understand it. Sorry to be so blunt, but you are going on and on without studying the basics of this complex system.</p>
<p>You are going to see that the long and short vowels depend on where the accent falls in the word, so that you can&rsquo;t get whether something is a shva na from the sequence of letters and vowel points alone.  Kimhi and followers laid down these rules and they are what they are. I&rsquo;m not saying I like them, but if you want to set type following them, there&rsquo;s no way to automate it from the sequence of letters without a look-up of words, and indication of where the accent falls.</p>
<p>I am not saying that the Bible uses more vavs. That isn&rsquo;t what I wrote. Do you understand the meaning of the conversive vav, vav hafuch? It changes the past to the future, as in &ldquo;ve&rsquo;ahavta&rdquo;. That function of the vav exists in the Bible but not in modern Hebrew.</p>

<p>I spoke to Prof. Dotan just now. He stresses the same point, that the &ldquo;<emphasize>determination of the shva-na (the sounded shva) and an ordinary shva (the unsounded shva) is only determined by the nikkud, but never only by the letters</emphasize>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Prof. Dotan left the door open though to an analysis as to why letters can not be grammar rules.</p>
<p>He also stated clearly that the determination of whether a shva is an unvoiced shva or a voiced shva-na, this is completely dependant upon context, even when the spelling of that word is identical. The difference though is whether the kamatz immediately before the shva is gadol or katan. When it&rsquo;s gadol, it&rsquo;s past tense, and the shva is unvoiced. But when it&rsquo;s katan, it&rsquo;s an imperative, and the shva is shva-na and voiced.</p>

<p>As always, you ask very good questions.</p>
<p>Why learn for many months if its pointless? What&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>Prof. Dotan said explicitly that according to the rules (Seow&rsquo;s four, or Bachur&rsquo;s five [he said Vilna Gaon took it from Bachur, who lived before Kimchi]), GSUB replacement can not be done.</p>
<p>&hellip;according to the rules, that is.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;You want to go around the rules and do it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he advised to learn the nikkud rules very very well, and the grammar rules inside out. Why? Because it&rsquo;s doable.</p>
<p>He stressed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the letters; it&rsquo;s the nikkud!&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David,</p>
<p>I think understand what you are saying, but I don&rsquo;t think youy understand what I am saying.</p>
<p>Like your and Bill&rsquo;s view, I must learn these books about Hebrew grammar and nikkud, to speak intelligently about anything related to these subjects.</p>
<p>Like your and Bill&rsquo;s view, based upon the the four rules enumerated by Seow, based upon Kimchi&rsquo;s analysis (as explained by Chomsky), it is impossible to simply clasify all kinds of shva-na by a sequence of letters and nikkud.</p>
<p>Dotan agrees that based upon these 4 or 5 rules (he explained that Vilna Gaon copied Bachur&rsquo;s definition of 5 rules, long before Seow articulated them), it is not possible to do as I seek. Again, the stress here by Dotan is &ldquo;based only on these rules&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yet, Dotan interpreted that I seek to think &ldquo;utside the box&rdquo;, in a unconventional way, around the rules and not by the rules, like learning how something works by reverse engineering it. To do in this way, then what I seek is possible to accomplish (instead of 4 or 5 rules, there is a series of GSUB routines involving sequences of nikkud and kamatz katan being replaced by nikkud and kamatz katan with certain shvanas). But, I need to gain expert understanding of the dynamics of nikkud, and also kamatz katan, too.</p>
<p>Is this clear?</p>

<p>Prof. Dotan stressed 5. Not 4 or 6. 5 rules. He listed each one. The 4 from Seow and another one.</p>
<p>Those are the grammatical rules defining when a shva is a shvana.</p>
<p>He then explained that I was trying to define when a shva is a shvana by context, i.e. the sequence of nikkud, not letters. First, he rejected this possibility, and afterwards reconsidered. To accomplish this goal, he advised me to become expert in nikkud (and Hebrew grammar in general). But he stressed over and over nikkud. Then, he suggested tht I speak to him again in a few months after I gained expertise in nikkud.</p>
<p>He definitely thought my goal was worth the effort, as he thought that it was possible to achieve.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Israel, of course Seow&rsquo;s text book is not original scholarship, and does not claim to be. Its purpose is to teach grammatical rules developed or discovered by others to those learning Biblical Hebrew. What is the 5th rule that Seow&rsquo;s book doesn&rsquo;t give?</p>
<p>As to the idea of automating the kamatz katan and shva na, the question is first of all automating based on what.</p>
<p>If you want to get it from just the sequence of letters, that is not possible because first of all there are quite a number of words in Hebrew that have the same letters and different vowels and a totally different meaning. So I would think that the existing &ldquo;autonikkud&rdquo; must give you options when there is ambiguity.</p>
<p>The second possibility is that you have nikkud already, but without distinguishing the shva na and the kamatz katan. The example Prof. Dotan gave you of the same vowel sequence that can be either a kamatz katan or not, depending on its meaning, seems to me to refute the possibility of fully automating the process.</p>
<p>But generally, you are going to have to find a means of telling from the letters and nikkud alone whether the accent is on the final or penultimate syllable. I don&rsquo;t know whether that is possible, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>Another possibility is paying attention to the meteg, if that is used. Then you can get somewhere, because according to Seow the meteg is sometimes used to mark a &lsquo;long&rsquo; syllable, and also a sheva na. If you can automatically distinguish the different kinds of meteg&ndash;and that seems pretty difficult&ndash;then you might be able to do it. But that assumes that the meteg has been put in systematically. But here you have evidence that there is not infrequently non-systematic spelling going on&ndash;such as in the varying treatment of the shva na in different prayer books.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that there is no way around it except through a look-up. And since you can do it through a look-up, there is really no advantage to the end user whether you do a spell check or encode things in the font. So again I don&rsquo;t see the point of the exercise. The spell check and auto-nikkud programs already exist, and if they don&rsquo;t mark the shva na, there is no reason why this couldn&rsquo;t be added.</p>
<p>ps I was referring to the Chomsky article mentioned in these threads, not his book.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I humbly disagree. According to Prof. Dotan an identically spelled word with a shva, and then a kamatz preceding it, the shva is not a shvana unless the kamatz is a kamatz katan. First kamatz, then shva; or first kamatz katan, then shvana.</p>
<p>Hence, the GSUB set of shvana routines must operate AFTER the GSUB set of kamatz katan routines.</p>
<p>What about words that have different nikkud preceding the shva? If the kamatz occur two or more letters before the shva, does the same rule apply? Does it, David?</p>
<p>According to Prof. Dotan, the meaning is mainly in the letters, but the determination of the shva beinga unvoiced shva or voiced shvana is only from the nikkud. If the kamatz precedes the shva, then the different meaning can be determined if the kamatz is gadol or katan.</p>
<p>Please cite me identically spelled words, letters and nikkud, that either have kamatz more than one letter before it, or no kamatz at all. I will ask Prof. Dotan if there is an indicator. Are their such words?</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done it yet. John Hudson says it possible to have a look-up exception table, or maybe even a look-up &ldquo;do-it-here&rdquo; table. I didn&rsquo;t see how in Volt. Maybe with the Adobe tools.</p>
<p>For sure, this is uncharted territory, as no OT font to date has done this, but it can be done.</p>

<p>How?</p>
<p>My impression was the opposite. This was the key to determining a shva or a shvana. When Prof. Dotan heard this, he totally changed, and encouraged me strongly to pursue this. He then repeated over and over, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the nikkud, not the letters. It&rsquo;s the nikkud, not the letters. It&rsquo;s the nikkud, not the letters.&rdquo; &ldquo;Study the nikkud very well.Understand how they interact with each other. Also Hebrew grammar, but mainly the nikkud.

<p>I think this is because of two things:</p>

<li>
<p>Rejection of one or more of the rules mentioned above, based on inferences from the writings of certain Rishonim authorities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Prof. Dotan stated, with all due respect, the עם הארצות &ldquo;limited knowledge&rdquo; :) of the prayerbook editors.</p>

<p>In fact, when I told Prof. Dotan that I was a Chabadnik, he apologized retroactively for calling a certain גדול בישראל great Jewish leader such a disrespectful term. He used the word, &ldquo;Harsh&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I told him, as a Chabadnik the word, harsh, only applies to the way G-d treats us to keep us in the Galut so long. Nothing else is harsh. He agreed.</p>
<p>Like Abraham argued with G-d about His decision to destroy Sedom, Chabadnikim argue with G-d. We do what He instructs, but we argue.</p>

<p>First, it is possible to make the process automatic.</p>
<p>Second, automatic insertion by a font is much easier and much less time consuming that an add-on product.</p>
<p>If the data is preexisting, as much data already is, one would have to run it through the spell checker outside InDesign ME. For there is no add on as of yet for InDesign, although it could be written in a script. However, an smart OT font is the fastest, simplest, and best way to go.</p>

<p>Until the Unicode Consortium assisns a value to the shvana, no spell checker or auto nikkud program can do anything, even if somebody updated them. Which they won&rsquo;t because there&rsquo;s no money in shvana, kamatz katan, etc.</p>
<p>The advantage is to teach Jewish children, for publishers, and Christian Bible students, teachers, scholars etc. Maybe Hebrew poetry too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I consulted the Eretz Chemdah organisation <a href="http://eretzhemdah.org/qna.asp?PageId=3">http://eretzhemdah.org/qna.asp?PageId=3</a> regarding discrepancies in different prayerbooks which mark the shva-na.</p>
<p>I received this reply (selection):
<cite>There is a fundamental disagreement regarding specific Shva incidences (&ldquo;Sheva Merachaif&rdquo;). A few siddurim (including the classic Chabbad Siddur) mark Shva Na following the system of Rav Zalman Henna (who lived about 300 years ago). However, all of the recent literature with which I am familiar rejects his approach. Artscroll&rsquo;s markings reflect the accepted opinion.</cite></p>
<p>Who was Rav Zalman Henna?</p>
<p>Prof. Dotan refered to a person named Bachur who Hebrew grammar views were adopted by Vilna Gaon. Who was Bachur?</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that Prof. Dotan said that in a situation that a shva follows after a kamatz, if the kamatz is katan then the shva is voiced ie. shva-na, but if the kamatz is gedol then the shva is unvoiced ie. shva-nach. See the sample above. In factm, I repeated the rule back to him to confirm that I got it right.</p>
<p>But Eretz Chemdah said the very opposite:
<cite> After a Kamatz Katan, the Shva would be Nach.
I believe that a Shva Na cannot appear after a Kamatz Katan.
However, A Shva Nach can appear after a Kamatz Gadol.</cite></p>
<p>Are they simply incorrect, or did I recall Prof. Dotan&rsquo;s words incorrectly, or are there two views?</p>

<p>Are you saying that Shay Lemorah has more than one chumash? One version (in a custom made font, with a shva-na as a small asterisk within a circle) which I have, and another one too (in FrankRuehl with an enlargened shva) which you have? Plus you have a Yeminite chumash from Israel (in Koren-bold).</p>
<p>I prefer the shva-na symbol above the letter, either as Kehot&rsquo;s floating asterisk, Shay Lemorah&rsquo;s asterisk within a circle (ArtScroll also uses a short vertical line (like the rafe taam - unicode 058F) (Unicode should assign another code for shva-na, as we see that it is not a shva-na <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafe">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafe</a>) to the below the letter enlargened shva. It draws too much attention to itself, where as the above the letter is bother subtler but &ldquo;does its job&rdquo; to draw the users attention that this shva is different than a shva without this mark. Do you agree?</p>

<p>No. I&rsquo;m just saying that for some reason there&rsquo;s a problem with the &ldquo;Insert image&rdquo;, so I didn&rsquo;t post more images (shay la&rsquo;morah). The chumash with the font FR isn&rsquo;t shay la&rsquo;morah.</p>

<p>This is up to the printer. If they don&rsquo;t have alot of ink then &ndash; 2. It is the second of two, in immediate succession + 4. It comes immediately after a long vowel. If they have a lot of ink  then &ndash; 3. It comes immediately after a strong dagesh. See Seow page 347.</p>

<p>First, Prof. Dotan said, based upon the 4 or 5 point system of grammatical rules, this is impossible. After I pointed out that even if two identically spelled words can be defined differently, because one has a kamatz-gadol, and the other has a kamatz-katan, then Prof. Dotan changed his tune.

<p>Eventhough I am stuffed fll of latkes and have traces of sufganiot in my mustache, nevertheless I have not forgotten.</p>
<p>Rav Henna&rsquo;s more complicated system seems to be best suited to attain my goal. Rabbi Shmuel Rabin of Toronto, Canada, warned me that Rav Henna&rsquo;s system produces more shva-nas and has ore complex rules, but who cares, says I.

<p>The additional views, of the Minchas Shai, Eliyahu Bachr, and R' Zalman Hanau (Henna) are based on grammatical issues of which they differ.</p>

<p>The son-in-law of the near-by rabbi (a Av Beis Din and Dayan/Judge of a Rabbinic Court) showed in the R' Joseph Cairo&rsquo;s Code of Jewish Law, the commentary Magen Avraham expose on the applicable use of the shva-na, defining the rules for their contextual placement.</p>
<p>The additional views, of the Minchas Shai, Eliyahu Bachr, and R' Zalman Hanau (Henna) are based on grammatical issues of which they differ.</p>
<p>Hence, the advance OT fonts I propose will have automatic placement in any nikkid or nikkud/taam text based upon the MA&rsquo;s definition.</p>
<p>Then, the very same font design will also be available in 3 flavors; Minchas Shai, Eliyahu Bachur, and Zalman Henna.</p>
<p>Four versions of every font. They all share 98% of the same code.</p>
<p>Does this make sense?</p>
