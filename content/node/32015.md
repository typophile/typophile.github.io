  is a polaroid of where I live and love. I hope you like it.\r\n\r\nInspired by Argentina
  and its culture, Alejandro Paul\u2019s Candy Script captures the country\u2019s
  spirit. It comes from the tradition of window sign painting, but its thick hand-brushed
  characters - with alternates for almost every upper and lowercase letter - have
  a personality all their own. Tons of OpenType alternates included, over 600 characters
  in all. <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/download/pdf/candyscript.pdf\">Read more about
