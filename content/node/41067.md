  from the 1957 board game <em>Careers</em> by John Waddington Ltd.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering
  if any suggestions could be made for either of the two san serifs on this board
  space; I did wonder about Franklin Gothic for the condensed 'May Enter Hollywood'
  but it doesn't look quite right.\r\n\r\nThe uncompressed type is, I think, Gill
  Sans Bold?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/careers_1_6280.jpg]\r\n\r\nMany

  body: I think you're right, but that 1 looks more like Arial Bold to me, which doesn't
    fit the date.

  body: The condensed typeface is one of the condensed faces from the old Monotype
    Grotesque series. The one also looks like it's from that family. They may have
    substituted it for the standard Gill Sans one, which is indistinguishable from
    an I or an l. I am pretty sure there was also an alternate one for Gill Sans,
    but I don't recall that it looked like that.

  body: 'Also, <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BureauGrot">Bureau Grot</a>
    would be a good substitute for the condensed face. It was based on Monotype Grotesque. '

    faces \u2013 the 'R' has a little kick that the Monotype Grotesque does not. "

  body: Bureau Grotesque didn't exist in 1957 (it was designed in the Nineties), so
    it was some other typeface in the original. What I meant was that BG may be the
    closest you can get with what's currently available.
