body: I have long used Torino BT as a text font, and recently obtained Torino OPTI
  Bold, Extra Bold, Heavy. I was delighted to finally have a bold, but Torino doesn't
  co-operate. It 'substitutes' a font like Old Standard bold, which is similar, but
  will not show Torino OPTI Bold, now named as simply, 'Torino bold' Having re-named
  the entire family, the problem persists. I'm stumped. Can anyone shed light?

    When communicating, it's best if you do not assume that everybody else is exactly
    like you.\r\n\r\nWhat is the computer operating system? What software? Perhaps
    a courtesy link to the font? How did you install the fonts? Did you do the obligatory
    reboot to see if this fixes the problem?"

  body: "To me it seems that BT und OPTI may indicate that these Torino weights come
    from different foundries. Maybe one or more of their font name and/or style entries
    are too similar and cause a font name conflict. Are you sure that you have deleted
    all of the font caches after \u2018fixing\u2019 the names?"

    body: Well, I've re-named all these as simply 'Torino', with the usual modifiers.
      There is a Torino Medium,and a Heavy, which have a Regular as their font subfamily
      names. I don't know which 'font cache' you mean. Where would I find that?
