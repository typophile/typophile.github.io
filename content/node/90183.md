  cover & posters. \r\n\r\nI'm under the impression that Courier is the standard typeface
  for scriptwriting. However, this might seem a tad generic, so I'm tempted by something
  more contemporary (set it modern day). I've been curious of Officina & Stag. Would
  anyone have any thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for any sort of input!\r\n"

    & poster. It'd be nice to 'nod' to the format & type.\r\n\r\nThanks for the link,
    bookmarked!"
