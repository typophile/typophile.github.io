  some of the detail in the fill of the letterforms (the little lines) seen in the
  letters below. Eventually, I'll have to probably draw what I want by hand, but I'm
  hoping to find a usable substitute to include on mockups...\r\n\r\nAny leads?\r\n\r\nThank
  you thank you!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2907077367_24e4f934e9_4931.jpg]"

  body: 'Yep, I know it. Pretty much what I''m looking for is a script typeface with
    this type of shading within the letterforms. On the original, you can see that
    there are little lines to give the shaded illusion when printed.  '

  body: "hi,\r\n\r\nthis is the engraving lady and yes, this is engraved, probably
    by hand.  \r\n\r\nits not a font.  do you have the plate (or die) or just the
    print. \r\n\r\nthere are 2 categories for this kind of font available: script
    and calligraphic (calligraphy.)\r\n\r\nthe \"lines\" are either the shadow cast
    within the \"cut\" or the guide lines scribed first. neither of which will help
    you.\r\n\r\nif your task is to replicate this, best and (historically \"correct\"
    according to the market) is to re-draw it in illustrator.  it will be lovely.
    \ and maybe you can use the lesson learned for someothing else."

  body: "Offhand, the only font I know that has these kinds of fills is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/treasury/|Treasury]],
    a revival of an old MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan 1875 typeface by the same name,
    by Canada Type. Patrick Griffin and Rebecca Alaccari made a very ornate script
    with lots of variations that can be used, including two styles of fills.\r\n\r\n-
