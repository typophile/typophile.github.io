  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everybody,
I am planning to start my own web developing business. First, I will be starting off at home and then seeing how it goes and will decide to take it to a bigger level. Keeping in mind the present scenario, web designing and internet based business are proving to be one of the most profitable businesses, but having said that it’s important here to deliver the best. I just want to get as much information as I can and tips before really getting into it. I am planning to start with one or two small projects and then thinking of expanding my business when having enough of work and resource. What do you people think on that?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I opened an Internet Web hosting and design/support business in 1996 when it was rare to find someone who could spell Internet, much less know how to deal with it. We were profitable until we sold the business early this year. However, &ldquo;profitable&rdquo; can be misleading. We had a dedicated server which was a fixed monthly cost. The only other direct charge was our ISP support. It was a home business, so there was no rent. In other words, what was left over was &ldquo;profit,&rdquo; and it kept food on the plate and lights on in the house. We had 200 hosting accounts at one point.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, your competition is not the guy down the street offering the same services you are, it&rsquo;s outfits like GoDaddy and 1and1 who offer hosting and page design software on the cheap, so you services are no longer required&ndash;at least for the brochure-type sites.</p>
<p>Think about the added dimension of offering a full marketing package, of which the Web is only a part. This sort of service, if developed and pitched well, falls more into the advertising arena than into simple Web design work, and the money is significantly better.</p>

<p>No, sorry, your topic is not specifically about type, typography, font making or fonts, neither is it specifically related to any of those things.</p>
<p>So I am chucking it out. I&rsquo;m not a moderator and can&rsquo;t take any practical measures against it, but I draw your attention to the basic facts of the matter. This is a typography forum, dude, not a web design or a business forum. Please, if you don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>Please. Thread topic relevance rating: minus five stars.</p>
<p>Curt, why are you responding to this? You&rsquo;re doing the wrong thing too man.</p>

The fact that you are in a forum labeled GENERAL DISCUSSIONS and ANYTHING GOES makes your argument kind of weak. Ultimately, good forums HAVE a &lsquo;general&rsquo; area to keep people like you happy by not cluttering up the more narrow topic areas.</p>
<p>But, anyways, this is a spam post, so it should be deleted.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a slim chance that it could just be a very naive and annoying person actually personally asking this question all over the internet, but more likely it&rsquo;s an SEO farm testing phrases. There&rsquo;s been a lot of this going on lately. They&rsquo;ll come into a forum and post a semi-grammatically correct post that relates somewhat to the forum. They then do this multiple times all over the internet to track SEO stuff.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello,
Starting a web design business from home is not a bad idea; it’s easy to do some small projects on own and then after having a market position, you look out to expand. Web designers are in demand as maximum of business owners are attracted towards internet. It’s an excellent opportunity to capitalize on this. I came across a good information package called [url=http://www.2ono.com/web-Design-Business.html]web design business startup kit [/url]. It will teach you how to start a web design business, How to build a profitable web design business and run it from home or an outside facility, finding clients offline and online and tips and ideas for promotion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>well, spam or no spam, I got to read about Curt&rsquo;s business and it made me think.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing Curt!</p>
<p>So as a designer who might make their money from internet hosting, the main product you&rsquo;d be selling them is the design, and try as much as you can to bring that out of the browser, onto paper and other things, because that&rsquo;s value that big hosting companies don&rsquo;t offer, thus giving you the competitive edge?</p>
<p>I think a lot of it is like eBay too, market makes a difference, tell a story, look into it and find out why it&rsquo;s valuable and you&rsquo;ll do a better job of selling it.</p>
<p>For Curt or others: How hard would it be to start a hosting service, and would that possibly be a good idea for a freelance designer, to give them a more stable income flow month-to-month while their contracts get shuffled around?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Most of our customers absolutely resisted a high-end design. It was a hard sell to convince them that a good design would really have a return on the investment&ndash;often it is simply not true <g></p>
<p>Starting a hosting service is really fairly simple. Get a dedicated or managed server somewhere, figure what is a competitive monthly/yearly fee for hosting clients, and go for it. I recommend not using a shared server; dedicated/managed gives you absolute total control over what you can offer. We charged $14.95/month per hosting account and paid $69.95/month for a dedicated server.</p>
<p>Your best bet for new clients is to watch for new business announcements or pound the pavements. Be particularly on the lookout for the really new who have no brand identity, no printed material, no Web presence. The Web site design and hosting may be your foot in the door and may result in a complete brand development.</p>
<p>Always keep in mind the economic state of the USA at this point, and don&rsquo;t scare a new client with the whole package price. A small piece here and there can be developed over time.</p>
