    they have weird hours so make sure you check them.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pabook.com/\r\n\r\nIf
    you are interested in printing, there is Rohner Letterpress who have one of the
    best letterpress capabilities in Chicago.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rohnerletterpress.com/\r\n\r\nThere
    is also a Book Arts center, which I haven't been to, but always wanted to go while
    I lived there:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bookandpaper.org/home.html\r\n\r\nAnd, you HAVE
    to go to Millenium Park, which is pretty cool, specially in summer time:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.millenniumpark.org/\r\n\r\nAlso,
    as someone mentioned above, avoid Navy Pier. It's cute, but it's not that nice.
    Go to the Hancock center observation room though, the view is more than amazing.\r\n\r\nTry
    going to neighborhoods like Wicker Park/Bucktown and Wrigleyville, they are nice."

    it.\r\n\r\nI'll second Prairie Avenue Books and the Goldstar though. Around the
    Wicker Park area (which is where the Goldstar is), I'd also recommend the Beechwood
    Tavern (great jukebox, cheap beer) and Leo's Lunchroom (huge sandwiches, great
    potato salad). If you're in the mood for a pub crawl in that area, you could also
    hit Rainbo, the Inner Town Pub, Zakopane, & Phyllis' Musical Inn.\r\n\r\nYou should
    also check out the Newberry Library. If you're an out-of-towner, you can get a
    day-pass (you have to have an Illinois ID to get a year-long Reader's Room pass).
    Quite a nice collection of old books (Nuremberg Chronicles, Plantin's Polyglot,
    Ratdolt's Euclid, etc.), as well as volumes from the early 20th century. If you
    want directions on the 'el' and a short walkthrough of which floors the various
    collections are on, email me off-line.\r\n\r\nI've been doing some work on the
    Vandercook Universal I at the University of Illinois lately. If you feel like
    playing with some type while you're here, you're probably welcome to come by for
    a day (I'll have to check with the folks I'm working with).\r\n\r\nGreat Thai
    food (southeast Asian in general really) is off the Argyle stop on the red-line

  body: "[WARNING: This is completely off-topic. If you don't care about how I feel
    about Millenium Park in Chicago, do not, under any circumstance, read this post.
    Thank you.]\r\n\r\nWell, frankly, a lot of my dislike hinges on personal taste.
    I can't stand Frank Gehry's buildings. And I'm horrified that the city paid an
    unholy sum of money for a building that's not even a building, but is a giant
    sculpture. I think if you pay a man to design an amphitheater, especially if the
    man is a world-renowned architect, he should make some minimal attempt at designing
    it with a mind for acoustics. What we have is a pretty steel frame with speakers
    hung from it, over a flat green lawn, in front of Gehry's bulbous, tiled homage
    to himself. \r\n\r\nThen there's Anish Kapoor's humongous steel bean. Not even
    sure what to say about it, since it's been under a canopy for the majority of
    its life. Once again, I'm not a huge fan of Kapoor, and I've no doubt that less
    money could have been spent on a sculpture that's as good as the bean, and is
    actually visible. Although I'm sure that once all the welding seams are completely
    buffed, I'll faint in a swoon.\r\n\r\nThe 2 monolith fountains ... I just don't
    get it. And the pseudo-classical colonnade on Michigan and Randolph -- well, I'm
    once again prejudiced in my hatred for useless historicism. To its credit, it's
    not as horrific as the H Washington public library.\r\n\r\nBut aside from my unbending
    beefs with the art and architecture, I just can't get over the amount of money
    wasted. I don't remember the figures anymore, but the amount that the whole project
    went over-budget was truly staggering. And on the few occassions I find to go
    to MP (I take drawing classes there once in a while), I don't see many Chicagoans.
    Most of the folks there seem to be the out-of-towners going to the museums and
    shopping the 'Mag mile'. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we have one of the worst public
    school systems in the country, which is deperately in need of funding (as well
    as other major changes, no doubt), but what the city gets is a nice park? Huh?
    No doubt tourism brings a mess of cash into the city's coffers, but I just can't
    get behind this one. Probably because the kids from CPS wind up at my college.
    Luckily for them, it's 2 blocks from the park. So I guess they can forget about
    their criminally sub-par secondary education, and go play in the fountain or look
    in the bean-shaped fun house mirror.\r\n\r\nSorry for the rant. I should be able
    to see the humor in all of it."

    at all. Compulsory schooling was invented to: teach the kids the Official Party
    Line; and free the moms to work (i.e. slave). It's just a gilded brainwashing/babysitting
    scheme. And how could it be anything else in this system? And that park is the
    decoration that distracts from the truth about the system.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
