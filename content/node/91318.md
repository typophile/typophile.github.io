  body: What makes you think it's a font? It's on a sloping curve with the leg of
    the x tucking rather neatly under the a. Most probably custom.

  body: "Thank you for responding, I just called  the client and he  said it was made
    in microsoft word and that he made it, mind you hes a 60 yr old non-tech person.
    Thats the only information I know. When he attempted to find the font he missplaced
    it, so the search began. I asked him if it was custom made and he pressed that
    it was not.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your help!"
