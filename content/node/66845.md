  (or opt not to)?\r\n\r\nPlease tell me to mind my own business if you like but I'm
  genuinely interested in how your mind works... \r\n\r\nMine's fairly self-explanatory
  (incuding the lacklustre typography!) but some aren't. For example, why are some
  smaller than the suggested size?\r\n\r\nI'm really intrigued by some avatars..."

    graphic was sent to me by a fellow Typophile, in gratitude for some assistance
    I had provided, and was written by his calligrapher friend. It is one of the nicest
    things anyone has ever given me.

    when I realised I could centre the stem. I like the way it looks like some kind
    of alien scarab. Sometimes I change the colours."

    from its extensive use in Tlingit as well as in several other orthographies for
    indigenous languages of the Pacific Northwest of North America. Not having the
    diacritic in a typeface is one thing, but there\u2019s a surprising number of
    fonts out there which have the diacritic but don\u2019t actually support its use
    on anything, or only support it on the precomposed characters specified in Unicode
    and not on anything else. Notice how the diacritic is visually aligned with the
    center of the italic X, how it\u2019s approximately the same width as the left-to-right
    stroke, and how it\u2019s positioned just a bit more than one stroke width from
    the bottom of the X.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for this avatar is because I really
    love Victor Gaultney\u2019s Gentium and I\u2019m patiently waiting for a new release
    of the full font..."
