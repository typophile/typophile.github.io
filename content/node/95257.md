  body: "It was originally a designed logo - not a font. Since then, [[http://cruztypedesign.com/|Ray
    Cruz]]  created a proprietary customized outline font for the company or its advertiser,
    Young and Rubicam - I think it was named \"CamelFont\". There have also been a
    number of fonts unoficially created using the Camel logo as a guide. The only
    one I can find right now is  [[http://www.nerfect.com/typecof.html|Coffin Nails

    The easiest way to find it out would probably be to ask directly to [[http://logopond.com/members/profile/35527|Gal]].\r\nPart
    of the /C, makes me thinking to a [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/serpentine/|Serpentine]]
    (Oblique Bold) customized.\r\n\r\nEdit: finally, got it! [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/konabold.php|Kona
    Bold]], manually slanted."
