<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Pick up a copy of the Wall Street Journal tomorrow, early, before it sells out. WSJ is supposed to unveil its redesign April 9. <br> <br>This paper is known as a 'financial' newspaper, but less known is the fact that WSJ has the best daily feature writing in the country on a consistent basis. <br> <br>Now, maybe design to match. <br> <br>I was worried that WSJ was going to become another horrid McPaper, the USA Today. But then I read that the redesign is being done by Garcia Media. <br> <br>bj <br> <br>Here are a few links. <br> <br><a href=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/business/1017788129.php target=_top>http://www.ojr.org/ojr/business/1017788129.php</a> <br> <br><a href=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2001/dec01/dec03/5_fri/news1friday.html target=_top>http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2001/dec01/dec03/5_fri/news1friday.html</a> <br> <br><a href=http://www.garcia-media.com/in_the_press/examiner.html target=_top>http://www.garcia-media.com/in_the_press/examiner.html</a></div>

<div class=commentbody> Brian, <br>Thanks for the heads-up! It's also helpful to own a pre-redesign issue, for comparison. Along with the press release I'd give up a few pounds for a large digital setting - mostly to measure ink gain against a hi-res scan of the actual output. Please?... <br> <br>BTW, in terms of content my fav daily has gotta be The Herald Tribune. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Who the hell has time to read a newspaper nowadays? And who wants all those old mountains of newsprint lying around in untidy piles? I don't even have steady work, but I don't have the time or patience for newspapers. Sorry - I love print, but I've never understood the appeal of newspapers. Give me a weekly mag like The New Yorker or something like The Atlantic any day. Perhaps if I'd ever seen a beatiful paper in my life I might feel different and have some time for them. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Re: Lacava. <br>Thanks for the reference, but The National Post online: <br><a href=http://www.nationalpost.com/ target=_top>http://www.nationalpost.com/</a> <br>is busy, busy, busy with information and design elements so I'll have to try to find it at a big newsstand. <br>While Lacava Design at: <br><a href=http://lacavadesign.ca/ target=_top>http://lacavadesign.ca/</a> <br>is Flash-based and it wrongly detects that my plug-in is not up to date, not letting me in.

<div class=commentbody>WARNING: I wouldn't want to turn this thread into a discussion of press gain (at least not entirely so), but please allow me this digression of sorts: <br> <br>> the typeface in question would be in the stock listings <br> <br>Oh, good thing you told me - I almost scanned the wrong section. "Scanned?!", you ask? Well, I've been obsessed with measuring press gain in newspapers for a while now. This is partly because Nour (Patria's Armenian counterpart) is supposed to end up as the body face for a daily newspaper. Another reason is my fascination with trapping - something not usually needed but potentially very beneficial in a newspaper, *especially* for tiny type like in stock listing... <br> <br>So what I would love to be able to do with TFJ's new font is to superimpose a small snippet of hi-fi outline data over a hi-res scan of actual output. A big favor to ask, maybe, but something I will do once I have the scan for you guys. <br> <br>In the meantime, you can check out the following images: <br> <br>A scan from my "target" newspaper, next to a rendering, with measurements: <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/armnews2.gif target=_top>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/armnews2.gif</a> <br>Point size: 8 <br> <br>This one is not my own comparison; it's from an article by Gurtler & Mengelt in Visible Language: <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/latnewsp.gif target=_top>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/latnewsp.gif</a> <br>Point size: they don't say. <br> <br>Now, the Armenian sample clearly exhibits much more gain than any western newspaper would find itself stuck with, and even the second image is probably too drastic these days, but as long there's *some* gain, I'd like to measure it. <br> <br>BTW, in case you'd like to see how bad it can get, here's a staggering overlay of Mandel's masterful Colorado font (used for phone books): <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/armnews2.gif target=_top>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/armnews2.gif</a> <br>Point size: ~4 <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody> What a nice press release. And what a nice font. Those fractions are genial - and phenomenally legible at that size - as are the alphabetics. And the font has 10 "uniwidth" weights too, wow. But I'm a sucker for technical wizardry... On the other hand, I even like the name! <br> <br>BTW, am I correct in noting that the paper quality is a bit lower now than before, or is that just within expected variance? If it is lower, then that makes Retina even more impressive. Another coolness is the trapping. Look at the bold "N" in the zoom view - it's clearly superior to the old Helvetica results. And the characters with small bowls (like the "R" - not shown there) have that distinct Bell Centennial thing going on. <br> <br>Anyway, if nobody at THF minds, I'd still like to scan and post a couple of more views of Retina: one showing a short paragraph, the other at very hi res. Tomorrow. <br> <br>TFJ + THF: Keep it up! <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody>OK, first a caveat: my scanner is only 600dpi optical, so anything greater has been interpolated - but it *is* an Agfa. The thing is, 600 is beyond the absolute resolution-fidelity of the reproduction anyway. *However*, gain can still be measured. <br> <br>The first is at 1200dpi, and it shows the good effects of the killer trapping, in some key letters. It also shows how the lc "g" has been reduced in the x-height to make more room for its descender. <br>(~250K) <a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_1.gif target=_top>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_1.gif</a> <br>Note: I've applied some gentle Levels, Unsharp Masking, and Posterize. <br> <br>The second is at 2400dpi, and this is the one I would like very much to be able to superimpose the outlines. If anybody could pass this request to TFJ for his consideration, I'd be very grateful. <br>(~300K) <a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_2.gif target=_top>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_2.gif</a> <br>Note: This is a raw scan, just posterized down to 128 shades. <br> <br>The third shows a rare text block in Retina (600dpi). WSJ is till using Helvetica for most of their tiny text blocks - but maybe this was a test to see if Retina could replace it wholesale. <br>(~200K) <a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_3.gif target=_top>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_3.gif</a> <br>Note: Tweaked as #1 above. <br> <br>---- <br> <br>What's really interesting about Retina is this: <br>If you consider that optimization for small sizes and press gain goes hand-in-hand with a certain "funkiness" in letterforms (like severe trapping, and exagerated counters - look at the lc "e"), it looks to me like Retina actually has a lot more room "down below". In effect, among the three lower limits (reproduction fidelity, font features and reader acuity), Retina removes the font issue: it could be used even much smaller than in the WSJ, were it not for limit #1, but especially #3. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody> Retina does work successfully even smaller -- we've proofed the fonts down to two point (!), and they still read comfortably. Of course, at this size you're really depending upon reliable printing. Sheet-fed offset on coated stock is a little more hospitable than the maelstrom of the WSJ print facility. <br> <br>Here are some additional high resolution scans of Retina and its predecessor. These are true 1,200 dpi scans, unadjusted. (They're also about 2mb each, so download them at your own peril.) <br> <br>www.typography.com/press/wsj_after_retina.gif <br>www.typography.com/press/wsj_before_retina.gif <br> <br>At some point I'd like to rescan these in color, but these should do for now. <br> <br>Despite Mr. Stalin's nanofont goofiness above, I do think that these kinds of atomic metaphors are useful for agate type. Like Bell Centennial, Retina has a lot of burlesque moves that are incomprehensible in large sizes but essential in small ones. In explaining this to Joe and David at the Journal, Tobias likened these strangenesses to particle theory, noting that when you reduce things down to an atomic scale, the laws of physics break down. I thought it a good comparison. </div>

Where 0.05mm ink spread makes no difference at 72pt, it's sure going to have an effect down there at 6pt. </div>

<div class=commentbody> True, true. There are also a lot of structural things you can do that go beyond ink traps and other "local" treatments -- perhaps someone here can post an illustration of the cent sign from the boldest of the Bell Centennial fonts. It's diabolically clever, and once again a reminder that Matthew Carter has all the good ideas. The fink. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Right, that's it with the cent sign there. the key thing is you need to open up the closed counter, so Carter's done that by trimming down the vertical bar. I have to say though that I'm a bit surprised that there's no taper to the ends of the vertical bar into the body of the character. <br> <br> <br>Joe </div>

<div class=commentbody>> www.typography.com/press/wsj_after_retina.gif <br> <br>First, thanks for that scan. It's much much better than mine (no surprise). <br> <br>I've taken the liberty to do two things with it: <br> <br> <br>1. Crop out this string: <br> <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_4.gif target=_top>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_4.gif</a> <br> <br>If TFJ is indeed "listening", I'd like to revise/downgrade my request for outlines to just those three letters (at that weight, of course). If it doesn't happen, no biggie - if it happens, super nice of him. <br> <br>BTW, it's interesting to note that some of the trapping is still visible - a sure indication that Retina has more room "below". <br> <br> <br>2. Splice together a comparison of pre and post numerals: <br> <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_5.gif target=_top>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_5.gif</a> <br> <br>I'll note again that the quality of the paper/reproduction seems lower in the Retina sample: look at the decimal points (which I'm presuming are rigid rectangles in the outlines). <br> <br>But the point of this comparison is the *structures* of the numerals, and Retina's are so superior to Helvetica's (while remaining stylistically homogenous), it's not even funny. <br> <br>---- <br> <br>Thinking some more about what I previously wrote concerning the three "lower limits" of legibility (with respect to size), I realized that the untapped potential of Retina (I mean untapped by WSJ) isn't really in terms of size (especially considering that the average WSJ reader is more likely to have faltering vision, being more "senior"), but more in terms of fidelity (or actually, lack of it): TFJ has made a font which can work well in much poorer reproduction conditions than we're seeing here. Now, a trapping axis would be *so* nice, but at least its [apparent] absence gives us something to look forward to! <br> <br>> Tobias likened these strangenesses to particle theory <br> <br>Not to be too literal, but let's not forget that we're physical beings in a physical world! <br> <br>I in turn might draw a parallel between the states of matter (solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma) and the states of reading (here with respect to size). I once sketched this rough graph: <br> <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/optic_01.gif target=_top>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/optic_01.gif</a> <br> <br>It tries to show a correspondence between size and optical compensation (here I mean things like more open counters). Above a certain point size (nominally 24 here) there is no need for compensation at all. Below a certain point size (like 5), the extenders [have to] become so short that you'd break down and use all-caps - at that size immersive reading is virtually impossible anyway. And the segment of least slope (here between 8 and 12) is the most delicate part, where boumas (word shapes) have to be just right. I could elaborate more, but you might be bored senseless already, and it's getting late over here... <br> <br>So let me try to wrap this up: <br>The reason for the non-linearity of the graph is due to the "fighting-sisters" nature of Legibility versus Readability: they come into play differently depending on type size (among other things, of course), and together they give up three states of reading: <br>1. Below comfortable immersive reading: here legibility is king (queen?), and x-heights have to swell, for example. <br>2. Immersive reading: readability is more important than legibility - and for example ITC-style x-heights ruin everything. <br>3. Above comfortable reading: legibility is a non-issue (although what might be called "decipherability" is key), and readability is moot. What counts most here? What I call "drama" (avoiding the potentially misleading "beauty"). <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Were you thinking I forgot? :-) <br> <br>So I scanned the Retina specimen from "Language, Culture, Type"*, and did the compositing myself: <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_4a.gif target=_top>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_4a.gif</a> <br> <br>* <a href=http://www.atypi.org/lct/ target=_top>http://www.atypi.org/lct/</a> Worth every penny. <br> <br>It's not the best quality (and I hope I chose the correct weight - the Agate Five), but hopefully it gives you some idea. <br> <br>Thinking about this some more, I feel more comfortable in restating that Retina goes further than it needs to in this specific commission/application (the WSJ stock listings), but that *does* mean it can survive even worse repro conditions and/or smaller sizes. <br> <br>hhp</div>
