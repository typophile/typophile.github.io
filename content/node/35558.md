  body: "Hi tilboy,\r\n\r\nFont-Choice: I think there are many rounded well executed
    fonts which are far better than the ancient VAG Rounded used in your draft. I
    can recommend \r\nGotham Rounded \r\n(http://www.typography.com/catalog/gothamrounded/index.html)
    or \r\nChevin \r\n(http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=GTT0000003).
    \r\n\r\nLogo-Appearance: The first thing that came into my mind, is that the rainbowish
    forms look like a tunnel/cave or is picturing sending out a signal. Also I think
    that the square form with rounded corners is more Caravan like. \r\nIf it should
    be the rainbow form, you can maybe use the C or c to build the caravan rainbow.
    \r\n\r\nThe tracking for the word Caravan is to loose and the tracking for center
    to tight. Also I would correct the space on the right and left side of the v.
    Also the space between r and a is to loose.\r\n\r\nAre there other ideas/variants/drafts?\r\n\r\nDerya\r\n\r\np.s.
    I like the second draft, but the word center looks bigger than the word caravan."

    What do you think if you enlarged Caravan the full width of graphic and brought
    \"center\" below it centered or right justified?\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.holadesignstudio.com"

  body: "that's great. i immediately got \"happy trailer!\" out of it, which was silly
    enough to make me smile out loud. it's rally good.\r\n\r\nfew technical things.\r\n\r\n1)
    your rainbow is egg-shaped. the ellipses are taller than wide. why for?\r\n\r\n2)
    rainbow stripes are different sizes in an odd way. why is the center one thicker..?\r\n\r\n3)
    i could drive a caravan through caravan, specifically between a and v, then v
    and a."

  body: "Hello everybody. Thank you all for your advices. I really appreciate the
    fact that you spend time to see my work and advice me. \r\n\r\nDerya: About the
    font,I was not so sure for my choice. I mean i know i want a rounded font but
    maybe it won't be this one. Thank you for the links. \r\nAbout the logo, you are
    right about the shape (caravans are squared with rounded corners, only some few
    very old models are rounded) but it looked better that way in the center of the
    ''rainbow'' or ''target''.\r\nAbout the tracking and the spacing u are absolutely
    right. I will correct it! \r\nI had few others ideas but i'm not sure if i should
    show them yet. \r\nThank you again, you've been very helpfull!\r\n\r\nHola: Yes,
    you are right, i need to make smaller the word center. About your idea with the
    ''center'' below the ''caravan'' I try it and i did'nt like it.But I didn't try
    the below and right justified idea. I will. \r\nThank you so much!   \r\np.s.
    I visited you website. Your work is really good.\r\n\r\npatricking: I'm glad you
    liked it, and more glad that you smiled when you saw it!  I wanted a happy logo.
    \r\n1) and 2)  i made it that way because i wanted also to be like a half target
    (except a rainbow) and the caravan to be in the center.  Maybe i should try it
    again like you said.   \r\n3) hahaha, you are right my friend! I'll fix it! \r\nThank
    you for your comments. \r\n\r\nI' ll make some changes and i'll be back again.
    \r\nThank you all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n "

    I'd change the colour of the grey arcs to yellow ones...
