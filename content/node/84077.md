body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nThanks to Typophile, I was able to make great strides on
  my personal logo last year to better brand myself as a designer. As someone who
  has always had an affinity for typography, I wanted to incorporate my initials D
  L S into it as letters. I like it, but I still get criticism that it's a little
  too \"out there\" and too feminine to represent me as a designer. Any ideas how
  to improve it? Where do I go from here? I've tried so many variations that I'm a
  little burn out, which is why I'm branching out to you guys.\r\n\r\nThanks for your
  help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/7_3_3618.png]"

    time we classified as feminine. Your logo should be consistent with the work you
    do (and the tastes of the clients you hope to attract). If graceful, delicate,
    and organic are adjectives that describe the work you do and want to do, then
    this is not \"too feminine.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I look at this logo, I see <em>SSS</em>.
    I wouldn't have guessed <em>DLS</em>, and even after I read your post I had to
    strain to pick out the <strong>d</strong> and the <strong>l</strong>."

    as an engendered term but still, Mojo, you bring up a good point: my work isn''t
    often this graceful nor delicate. Should I just go back to the drawing board?'

  body: "Here are some updates! I've sketched out a hundred things and as soon as
    I start working with them in Adobe Illustrator I don't like them. Here's one concept
    I've been working with--does it have promise? Where should I go with it? I'm including
    three phases of its development to show you a little of the process (3 is the
    newest). I like the Escher element especially the last, #3, starts to connotate.
    I guess I just don't know if it's my style because it's rigid, but I think the
    logo also conveys adaptability which is definitely part of my work--I do a lot
    of different projects from solar energy to babies... How do I put that all in
    one logo!?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5250.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_4715.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_5784.png]"

    make?  For example, what 3 keywords should come to mind when people see your identity?  How
    does the idea of a monogram support that message?  Could you give some examples
    of your work or link to your portfolio?  I do like the idea of suggesting a 3D
    form, and your last example seems to have the most potential in that direction.  '

  body: "Hi Luma! Thanks for your comment. So I suppose three keywords that would
    set me apart from others would be ADAPTABLE, INNOVATIVE, STYLISTIC. I have strong
    style, but design for a lot of different venues from solar energy corporations
    to baby books, and want to emphasize that in a logo. Mostly the work I do myself
    is more fun and \"youthful\" as I'm still in college. So I say adaptable in that
    I can design for what one needs me to design for. I'm innovative because I address
    whatever media in a way that will be most efficient while maximizing the third
    keyword, style. I have styles, not just one: I can design in a variety of ways.
    In short: versatility? I don't want my logo to be too rigid, too absent, but I
    also don't want it to be too graceful or too weak.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to my
    outdated portfolio: <a href=\"http://davidlernerschwartz.com/portfolio.html\"
    target=\"new\">DLS</a>. Thanks in advance for the help!"

  body: After looking at your work and reading the above, I wonder if the latest round
    of ideas are too minimal and too geometric.  I don't get those themes from your
    work.  Perhaps something less abstract would be fitting, as I don't see a lot
    of abstraction in your portfolio.  A monogram is already abstracted from the names
    it represents, and if you want people to get to your URL, you might need to emphasize
    your name.  Designing a personal brand is one of the hardest tasks a designer
    does, so good luck!

    part of the S instead of the L, removing the vertical stroke of S and keeping
    L as a lowercase straight line.\r\nBy the way, there\u2019s no need that one reads

    What do you mean by "there's no need that one reads the logo as dls?" Just curious!
    Thanks again.

    connect it immediately with you instead of a shoe boutique or a chandler's.

    I took your idea and played with it a little and got the image on the bottom.
    I put it alongside #11, which was my favorite from the logo sheet I made. Thoughts?
    Too complicated? This also introduces problems for scaling, etc.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Also just noticing now how I have to rework the \"3D\" feel at the bottom of the
    logo, but don't worry about that yet! Just love to hear your thoughts."

    screwy."
