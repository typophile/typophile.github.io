  body: Nice idea. <BR>Is it too cheesy to add little stubs on those &#34;drops&#34;
    to give them just a hint of being letters?  <BR> <BR>BTW, what do they do? <BR>

  body: The mark is really nice. Colors, shapes, angle, space. Works for me. I just
    wonder if a rounder, more geometric face would be better, more in keeping with
    the shapes??

    As are the droplet shapes. They are quite the <BR>trend among young bucks these
    days and showing up <BR>everywhere, especially on the Web. A little modification
    to <BR>those forms &#40;as Hrant suggests&#41; isn&#39;t a bad idea. <BR> <BR>I
    do see what you&#39;re doing with the &#34;dp&#34;, though, and I think <BR>you&#39;re

  body: hmmm... the stubs aren&#39;t doing it for me, a little bit distracting. <BR>
    <BR>maybe try experimenting with cuts like on this attachment. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4343.jpg"
    alt="david powers inc."> <BR> <BR>another suggestion is to incorporate the colours
    from the mark into the type ie. make &#34;davis&#34; blue, &#34;powers&#34; green
    and maybe &#34;Inc.&#34; green or grey. should give it some overall unity. <BR>
    <BR>and as someone else said another typeface could work better. also which ever
    typeface you use try making the stroke width of the type equal to the stroke width
    of the mark. <BR> <BR>iota.

  body: When I said geometric, I was thinking along the lines of Avenir or Gotham.
    Stronger still might be to use all uppercase characters. <BR> <BR>I agree with
    Stephen that Interstate has been used to death. It needs a nice vacation at Nice
    or Malta.

    that Gotham surely does.

    In fact I was working on Proxima when Avenir was released and almost threw in
    the towel. In then end, I decided that it was different enough to merit completion.  <BR>  <BR>And,
    I don&#39;t know, but I certainly <i>hope</i> Proxima has as much potential for
    overuse as Gotham. ;-&#41;'

  body: The reason Proxima doesn&#39;t have overuse potential has <BR>nothing to do
    with its quality or style. It is lacking in <BR>neither. It has everything to
    do with promotion and <BR>distribution. A Hoefler font is going to get more visibility
    <BR>and promotion than a FontHaus font. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m fine with that. But I
    understand why Mark, as the  <BR>beneficiary of any royalties, is not.
