body: I have some new logos to post, let&#39;s start with this for an architect company.
  I&#39;ve used the classic compass/architect ideia built from the first letter from
  the company name &#40;A&#41;. The &#34;swoosh&#34; &#40;oh my god&#41; reflects
  the Q tail and need more work &#40;this is just the sketch&#41; and induces the
  compass movement. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m quite happy with the type used and classic mood
  I take from the logo.  <BR> <BR>Any critique that could help improve it? <BR> <BR>thanks.

  body: adriano <BR> <BR>i like it a lot, i think you reflect in a very good way the
    &#34;managment of spaces&#34; &#40; did i express it o.k.&#41; arquitects have.
    in order to  improve this you should try other weigths on the curve that form
    the bar of you A, i think is a like weak  <BR> <BR>nice color <BR>CG

  body: Hi cristian, <BR> <BR>yes, I know right now the weak part of it is the curve
    that complements the A. I&#39;ll work on it and post a new version. thanks for
    your time.

  body: I don&#39;t think the logo needs a 3D form, in fact i would avoid that. The
    purpose of the arc is to <BR> <BR>1. complement the A with the Q tail feeling
    <BR>2. indicates that the compass rotates around the left a arm.

  body: 'Adriano: I like it very much. It is very elegant. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t mind
    that the left stroke of the A does not have a &#34;footing&#34;. But I also see
    what Hrant is reacting to. Could this be solved by reducing the weight of the
    right-hand stroke and perhaps the size of the serif? <BR> <BR>One other point:
    I have this urge to push &#34;ARQUITECTOS&#34; to the right and space it so it
    aligns with the serif of the &#34;A&#34;. How would that look?'

    it is that I see a little out of balance the sizes of the logo-text and the logo.
    You said you wanted to play with the curve and the Q tail and need more work:
    I think that is a good and nice point. Maybe playing with that the first, the
    rest &#40;the sizes&#41;, will come up naturally. Why don'

  body: I also like the idea of picking up the tail of the Q as the shape for the
    arc.  It would tie the two together nicely. <BR> <BR>I must say, however, that
    the first instance is quite elegant.

  body: in my opinion the logo concept is great. i don&#39;t like swooshs so much..
    i think if the swoosh was more calligraphic then geomatric, and so alittle more
    complex in its dynamism, it would be nice, and compliment the A more.

  body: I have only one opinion, its very delicate, are the designs of the client
    delicate, do they design highways or just maybe apartments, ask yourself does
    the logo represent the kind of business.

    with Itay K... feeling more caligraphic rather than  <BR>geometric will help this
    thing.

  body: Adriano, <BR> <BR>this IS a nice concept, but if you wouldn&#39;t have mentioned
    the compass, I wouldn&#39;t have seen it &#40;that might be due to the fact that
    the swoosh indicates a motion that the left arm of the compass - the right arm
    being the one defining the center of the circle - isn&#39;t very likely to do
    ... if I see it right&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, the &#34;A&#34; does have a technical
    feeling.
