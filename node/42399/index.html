		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a student, it would depend on the library, but probably. I’ve already dropped $400 on fonts this semester—and it’s only a month in! It would have been even better during my sophomore and junior years when I had less money to spend and was just using whatever bootleg fonts were going around. I also think professors would be less likely to give fonts to students if the cost of a years worth of fonts was about equal to two good textbooks.</p>
<p>This would also be a great deal for the organization I work for. We don’t have a huge budget so our display types don’t change much because we can’t justify dropping money on a font to use it once or twice. Paying a subscription fee would make a lot more sense, and allow me to avoid getting every font purchase approved. I would have very little trouble getting $100 per <em>month</em> approved if the collection were big enough.</p>
<p>Edit: On a related note, I would be especially likely to use it if the whole thing operated using FEX.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My answer would have to be &ldquo;It depends&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d like to have the option to choose between this and current standard licensing. I&rsquo;m assuming that you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to license an entire library for $100, so if I could choose maybe 2 full families in fully-featured OpenType and a handful of single-style fonts (probably display but not necessarily) this offer may be worth it. I&rsquo;d much rather be able to pick a few things that I think would work for me than be saddled with whatever a default licensing package might be. Of course, I&rsquo;m speaking as someone who is currently a hobbyist user of type, not a professional.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle I see would be enforcing this licensing scheme. Have self-obsolescing fonts been developed? How would you retrieve the fonts after 1 year? Would this system be based on the honor system?</p>

<p>That depends on the foundry. Many foundries do not upgrade you for free. Many more do not even offer discounts. On the other hand, an OpenType font often has far more in it than a normal PostScript Type 1 font may have. So a free upgrade there wouldn&rsquo;t really be fair in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>There will inevitably be a lot that changes in the next generation font format, and a lot that stays the same… just like every other technological step. But I personally don&rsquo;t expect the attitude toward the terms &ldquo;licensing&rdquo; and the idea of protecting intellectual property to change. In fact, if I were betting, I&rsquo;d say that the next format will offer foundries even more protection somehow.</p>

<p>Sadly, it is. Usually in graphic design courses, not typography ones. I once worked with a teacher who laughed when I said I was saving up for Adobe&rsquo;s font folio. He came in the next day with a copy on disk, and thought I was foolish for not accepting it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for all your comments. I was just trying to gauge your opinions.</p>
<p>Currently for several of our clients, we offer a licensing deal as follows: For a yearly fee they gain access to our entire library. As we come out with new fonts, they get access to those as well. When they use our fonts in their client&rsquo;s work, they bill price of the relevant fonts to their client. We offer them a discount on the font price that they can either pass along to their client, or take as a sales commission.</p>
<p>We also work with them to develop designs that they feel are useful.</p>
<p>So far it is working nicely.</p>

So are you saying that you give the design firm full access to the typefaces for design and layout purposes, but charge a discounted price for the font when it is actually put into use?</div>

Yes. So if you use typeface A-Light for a client1 you purchase the license of A-Light for the client at a discount. When you use typeface A-Light for client2, you purchase the license of A-Light for the client at a discount. And so on.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like that idea. It monetizes a practice that some designers have already. Some designers will download entire foundries' libraries, not legally of course, for use in the design process. Then, after the work of getting the typefaces approved by the client, etc., they will properly license the font from the foundry.</p>
<p>Your idea is the same, except legal. As an added benefit, the actual purchase of the typeface comes at a discount, and you get access to the newest fonts and perhaps unique fonts that otherwise would be unavailable. Nice compromise.</p>

<p>BTW I have been a P22 Clubmember for a few years now, because I like that concept too. Just a shame that their Library is somewhat limited. So for THIS concept to work there has to be quite a broad base of fonts to choose from &amp; maybe the possibility to change your prefs and such.</p>
