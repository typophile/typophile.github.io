  \r\nHe describes it as \"classic business-type\" font. \r\nAnyone have any ideas
  on: \r\n1/ What typeface this is;\r\n2/ Visual references to classic stationary
  that use openfaces; I am not very familiar with the genre;\r\n3/ What other fitting
  classic business openfaces might be? (He is very enthused about it being an openface)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nBetsy

  body: "Assuming that this IS from the 1920s about all I can contribute is the observation
    that a lot of letterheads and business cards in that era were engraved rather
    than set in type. The foundries had a few typefaces for letterheads and cards,
    including this one from the ATF 1934 catalog that imitated engraving:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EngraversShadedATF1934@40_4913.jpg]\r\nAs
    for the design, splayed tops for M were a lettering favorite and this is an effective
    way to present the idea in a formal way -- an inverted W supporting a V.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "This one looks easier. That's [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Futura|Futura]]
    by Paul Renner and to be specific, the Medium weight. I can't find an outline
    version but it's no more a problem nowadays. There are enough vector softwares
    on the market to recreate this treatment properly and quite easily actually. But,
    if you like to, I could also find some Inline's.\r\nFor the previous case, I'm
    sorry for haven't being helpful last time, I decided to focus my search on alternatives,
    assuming that this kind of treatment could be reproduced. I'll try to bring some
    good Open/Inline/Engraved typefaces."

  body: "If \"by something similar\" you mean an open/inline version of a sans or
    near sans with the flavor of the 1920s and 1930s without going to the extremes
    of Art Deco, then an interesting option is Lucian Bernhard's Bernhard Gothic Extra
    Heavy modified to an open version:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BerhardGothicXtrHeavyOpenSM_6740.jpg]\r\nThis
    would be legible at small sizes suitable for a letterhead.\r\nThe medium weight
    had a splayed M which could be used as model for the Extra Heavy, and would accept
    modification such as the nested V on top.\r\nDon\r\n"
