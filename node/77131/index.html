  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've recently finished a book written in Word 2010. I'm told that the final product will look far better if I use inDesign to adjust Word's somewhat clunky formatting. I now have a copy of inDesign, but no understanding of how to import Word documents and work with them. (Adobe's Help system doesn't seem geared toward importing and typesetting books.) Might anybody here be able to refer me to a suitable reference?

Thanks,
Michael</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In InDesign, go to File > Place, find your Word document, and click "show import options" in the import window before you click OK. If you already have styles set up in Word, you can convert them directly to InDesign styles, as long as you define the InDesign styles before you import. However, if you've never designed a book in InDesign, you'll probably want a tutorial of some kind, as you mention. I'm afraid I can't think of any InDesign book design tutorials, though I would certainly recommend Bringhurst's The Elements of Typographic Style as the best basic guide to book design. Incidentally, are you the author or the designer? Or is this a self-published piece? If it's self-published, then go right ahead and design it yourself, but as you probably know, a publisher would just want the Word files so they can have their own designers design your book. Hope this helps.

Launch InDesign, go to the Help menu and select InDesign Help. That will take you to an index page of help files for that version of InDesign.For example, if you have the CS4 version of InDesign, it will send you here:

Index to InDesign help files (CS4):
http://help.adobe.com/en_US/InDesign/6.0/index.html?trackingid=DYNQB

Importing text:
http://help.adobe.com/en_US/indesign/cs/using/WSa285fff53dea4f8617383751001ea8cb3f-6f41a.html

Creating long documents (books):
http://help.adobe.com/en_US/InDesign/6.0/WSa285fff53dea4f8617383751001ea8cb3f-6ccba.html

Their help files are useful reference, although I think that good tutorials (like Lynda.com which I mentioned previously) are a great aid.

		<div class="commentbody">If this book is your first InDesign project, I'd strongly suggest getting the assistance of someone who is proficient with InDesign to help you set up your files properly and get you started.

InDesign is a complex program used primarily by graphic professionals, and there are many ways you could screw up if you make a rookie mistake. You need to properly set up master pages, auto page numbering, prepare and apply paragraph style sheets throughout & character style sheets, use "space after" settings rather than blank lines to separate paragraphs, need to set hyphenation & justification settings, "keep" options, maybe create a baseline grid, and on and on.

I've used InDesign for years and I still screw up sometimes. Doing a book as your first project is just asking for problems unless you get some assistance.

No publisher I know of would have trouble with these characters. The quote marks are especially best left as U+2018, 2019, 201C and 201D (e.g., "curly" quotes). There is no algorithm that can "restore" them -- try 'Twas the night before Christmas . . . And as long as the text editor at the publisher's office supports Unicode General Punctuation, it will support dashes as well. The ellipses are a different issue, some styles prefer the ellipsis character, others periods with varying spacing in between.</div>
