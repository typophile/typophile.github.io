  body: "According to the German Wikipedia article the czech / slavic name R\u016F\u017Ei\u010Dka
    is pronounced something like roo-zitsh-ka.\r\n\r\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u016F\u017Ei\u010Dka\r\n\r\nI
    don\u2019t know if this is accurate (and in case it is, if this was also the way
    R. R. pronounced it or if he changed it to make it more memorizable / more obvious
    to pronounce in an English speaking environment)."

  body: I once referred to Ruzicka in a presentation using a slightly slavic pronunciation
    (the best I could manage without being too obvious about it). Afterward, Matthew
    Carter pulled me aside and quietly informed me that everyone at Linotype just
    called him Roo-zee-ka.
