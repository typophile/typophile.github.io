  body: "Sorry, it sounds probably helpless and lazy but to me, this logotype has
    nothing really distinctive. You could re-do the same starting with any standard/neutral/basic
    sans of your choice, simply editing it a bit. The only thing you need to keep
    in mind is /k design. You could start from [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/helvetica+neue|Helvetica
    Neue]] to [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/myriad|Myriad]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/trebuchet|Trebuchet]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/arial|Arial]]...\r\nMy choice here, Trebuchet
