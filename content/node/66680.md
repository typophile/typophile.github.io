body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/and_4995.jpg]\r\nIs there a name for this
  \"and\" glyph? (Is it even a glyph or more of a dingbat?) More importantly, which
  typefaces have this? I've seen this in metal type a few times, but I can't recall
  the typeface. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    search for Catchwords on MyFonts you will find the whole character set.
