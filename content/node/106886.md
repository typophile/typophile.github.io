  am looking for designers that I might consult in choosing an appropriate Japanese
  typeface. \r\n\r\nJapanese will only be used for select wall graphics and headings,
  and not for lengths of text. We have a curator on staff that is available to write,
  edit, and proof any text, but I am very much out of my league when it comes to understanding
  the design connotations of Japanese fonts. I am not so terrified of pairing Garamond
  with the Japanese version of Hobo (an obvious clash), as I am with pairing the Latin
  and Japanese equivalents of Bodoni and Tisa in a single headline.\r\n\r\nAt the
  moment, I do not know which Latin typeface I will go with, though it will likely
  be a conservative serif because the show's objects date from the 13th\u201319th
  centuries. \r\n\r\nThanks for any leads!"

  body: "The default typeface style in Japanese is \u660E\u671D <em>minch\u014D</em>
    \u2018Ming Dynasty\u2019, the style which is the equivalent of bog standard serif
    in Latin typography.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a bit more dressy appearance,
    there\u2019s the \u6559\u79D1\u66F8 <em>ky\u014Dkasho</em> and \u6977\u66F8 <em>kaisho</em>
    styles. The <em>ky\u014Dkasho</em> style is used in textbooks, and is a sort of
    \u201Chumanist\u201D intermediate between the rigid <em>minch\u014D</em> and the
    more naturalistic styles that imitate brush writing. The <em>kaisho</em> style
    is patterned after traditional woodblock printing, and it is still the platonic
    ideal of Japanese characters. For even more fancy stuff you can use a \u884C\u66F8
    <em>gy\u014Dsho</em> \u2018running script\u2019 style, which emulates the fluid
    but careful writing of a skilled calligrapher. The <em>gy\u014Dsho</em> style
    is still readable but can be tiring for long runs of text.\r\n\r\nIf you have
    a short piece of text that is not really meant to be easily read but is instead
    more just artistic, you can go all the way to \u8349\u66F8 <em>s\u014Dsho</em>
    \u2018grass script\u2019. This can be nearly unreadable, so that the reader has
    to concentrate on some characters to make out exactly what they\u2019re supposed
    to be. It\u2019s the typical style of calligraphy you see on wall hangings of
    poetry and proverbs and the like.\r\n\r\nYou sometimes may have use for a \u7BC6\u5B57
    <em>tenji</em> \u2018seal character\u2019 style. This is based on the forms of
    characters used in \u5224\u5B50 <em>hanko</em> signature seals that are used instead
    of handwritten signatures. Their use outside of the <em>hanko</em> context, without
    red ink, often gives a very archaic feel that hearkens back to ancient China.\r\n\r\nThere
    is also the \u30B4\u30B7\u30C3\u30AF <em>goshikku</em> \u2018gothic\u2019 style
    that is the Japanese equivalent of sans serif. It\u2019s probably not appropriate
    for a book on samurai, except maybe for back-cover blurb stuff or in contexts
    where the print is particularly small and hard to read otherwise.\r\n\r\nOther
    styles out there include handwriting, imitations of other scripts (Latin, Cyrillic,
    Hangul, etc.), and geometric stuff.\r\n\r\nBrowsing images using these various
    terms will give you a good idea about how the various styles appear and are used.
    Even if you hire a designer, the exposure to Japanese typography will be useful
    in reviewing the designer\u2019s work.\r\n\r\nOne thing that annoys everyone is
    Japanese text set way too small or light in the midst of Latin text. This is usually
    done in an effort to make the Japanese text fit existing Latin layout, because
    Japanese characters have much higher height and depth. Accept that you have to
    have more leading for the Latin text, don\u2019t punish the Japanese text by squashing
    it into unreadable oblivion."
