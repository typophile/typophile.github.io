  is rendered using Cufon, I have checked through the code and there is no reference
  to the name of the font.\r\n\r\nThey have recently reduced the font weight so the
  type on the website looks lighter than in the image I provided.\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be hugely appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yell2_4952.png]"
