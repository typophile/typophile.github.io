    still unsolved. Displace is a good one to add to the list of alternatives.

  body: "\"The Stroke Sans\", mentioned in that earlier discussion is the closest,
    if you edit out the penstrokes that connect the strokes of the letters.\r\n\r\nAnother
    candidate is CG Lisbon/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/?refby=bowfin|Lydian]],
    which is an old calligraphic sans that has the same broad pen calligraphic feel.\r\n\r\nI
    think this lettering might be easy-ish to draw with the pen tools in Illustrator,
    or some such application.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
