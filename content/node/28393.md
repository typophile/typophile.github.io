  body: "I must fill in here, because I have found that these tests are not really
    consequent. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the tests are great, but I got a little confused
    using them.\r\n\r\nI am a control freak by nature, so I ran all the tests on the
    same font.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to see that in some of the test-tools, the fonts
    will pass, in another test-tool I could get a warning and on the third I got an
    error.\r\n\r\nThey also have different \"rules\" on what they call a correct font.
    I have experienced differences in the vertical metrics, for instance.\r\n\r\nIn
    other words \u2013 it seems impossible to satisfy each test with the same font
    file. Don\u2019t ask me why ;-)\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it\u2019s very good also
    to try your fonts in different apps, on both Mac and PC, and on different computers.
    Print them on different printers, and if possible make print-proofs at some prepress
    company.\r\n"
