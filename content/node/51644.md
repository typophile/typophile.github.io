  would love some criticism on my personal logo design. I'm finishing school right
  now, so this would be going on business cards and stationary that I will be giving
  to potential employers in  the graphic design industry.\r\n\r\nI'm going for something
  simple and clean, but I also want it to be more masculine than feminine. I'm planning
  on using letterpress or an embossing for the final product on a fairly heavy stock.
  \r\n\r\nMy name is Bekka Palmer, hence the bp. \r\n\r\nAny advice/criticism/comments
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nBekka Palmer"

  body: "@ Lex:\r\n\r\nNegative connotations aside, I think we can agree that symbol
    was effective.\r\n\r\n@ Bekka:\r\n\r\nFirst thought is beefing-up slightly the
    thin parts of your logo. They may get lost when you size them down for letterpress
    printing. Second, is there a reason for the cartwheeling logo? It does not say
    \u201Cclean and simple\u201D IMO. What would it look like without the spinning?
    \r\n\r\nI think letterpress on heavy stock will be a great first impression\u2014like
    a really firm handshake. Good luck out there!"

  body: "@ Ace:\r\n\r\nOh definitely - it's a good-looking logo. I really like the
    choice of colours. I agree that the thins need to be thicker as well.\r\n\r\nThe
    spinning could work if it were tiled as a wallpaper and used as a background image.
    The logo itself doesn't need to be rotated like that.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    I think you could simplify it but thats my .02 cents.
