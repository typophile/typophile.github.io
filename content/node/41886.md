  body: "It's infinitely scalable Dan but usually you don't want to deliver halftones
    to a printer. That's their job. This is pretty cool on a special effect level
    though. Bookmarked.\r\n\r\nThere's also a way to do this in Photoshop with patterns
    and blending modes.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "But it's not a halftone in the typical sense, requiring line screens and
    all that jazz. The printer is still going to have to separate the images into
    their own halftone, which I suppose might introduce that wavy effect (can't recall
    the specific name), but that's still on the RIP end.\r\n\r\nBeing able to design
    a vector graphic at 1/100th size is going to be much smoother than designing a
    bitmap at 100 feet by whatever for a giant poster, and I'm sure the RIP will appreciate
    it even more."

    dots for any font in your system.

  body: "Moire. Very possibly that might happen with these images. Another reason
    it would be scary to be designing to scale and then have it output much larger
    - very unpredictable.\r\n\r\nTrue about the vector - I wish that was the case
    but I need photos. My criteria is if I have a choice and the entire background
    is raster, or the printer requests it, I deliver PS files. They're going to be
    just as large in an Illy or ID file. They're also going to be just as large no
    matter what scale you are designing at. PS completely supports vector if you know
    what kind of file to deliver the type remains sharp, even at 3000 plus points.\r\n\r\nIf
    you make an impossibly complex vector file, then the RIP will reject it, doesn't
    matter if it's 1\" x 1\". This used to happen all the time to people that had
    created a selection in PS and made it into a clipping path without knowing what
    tolerances were allowed in the dialogue.\r\n\r\nYou can also have fun with this
    type of effect in PS by printing with different line screens. You have a lot of
    control over the shape and frequency in PS (just don't try sending it to a printer)
    and most laser printers will print anything thrown at them. So I used to \r\nprint
    out photos (my base was 35lpi with a 45 degree angle line), resample them with
    a scanner and assemble. Fun.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong - I like this link for
    special effects\u2026\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: great post, my congratulations for sharing this, the only thing i dislike
    is that some things that the software does for you, force you out of your own
    creativity it is rather abstract and not actually part of the creator, these tools
    are so powerful that need to be used with caution so as not to disregard your
    own limits.
