  Porchez]] designed Sabon Next for [[Linotype]] in 2002.\r\n\r\nThe original [[Sabon]]
  was designed by [[Jan Tschichold]] in 1967 for [[D. Stempel AG]]. The typeface was
  commissioned by a group of German printers, who wanted a good text face that would
  appear the same on all three metal type mechanisms used at the time (hand-set foundry
  type, the [[Linotype Machine]], and the [[Monotype Machine]]). Its design was based
  on [[Garamond]].\r\n\r\nSabon was later converted for use on photo-typesetting machines.
  Still later, it was made available in digital format. The digital Sabon is distributed
  by [[Linotype]]. In 2001\u20132002, [[Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez]] revived and extended
  Sabon, creating the type family [[Sabon Next]]. Sabon Next is distributed by [[Linotype]],
  and is part of their [[Platinum Collection]].\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com\">Linotype's
  website</a> includes an overview of all of the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1436/sabon-family.html\">original
  Sabon font</a> weights, and all of the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/53159/sabonnext-family.html\">Sabon
  Next</a> weights as well."
