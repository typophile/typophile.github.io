body: "Greater Albion has just released three new families on Myfonts.com.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/jonquin/
  | Jonquin]] was inspired by some hand lettering seen on a World -War One recruiting
  poster. It\u2019s a family of three faces for display work and headings designed
  to be used readily as an 'All-Capitals' face as well as in upper and lower case
  format. Regular and bold weights are offered, as well as an even more decorative
  incised form. The whole family is ideally suited for poster and advertising work,
  as well as book and record covers and period themed signage.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jonquin_6366.jpg]\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/luscombe/
  | Luscombe]] is a boisterous and lively display face, recalling the shaded and outlined
  faced much beloved of 1920s poster and advertising artists, while offering a regularity
  of outline that those faces often did not achieve. It\xEDs ideal for poster and
  display work, or for signage with a subtle period feel. Mix the two faces to add
  emphasis where it\u2019s needed.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Luscombe_6662.jpg]\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/zenia/
  | Zenia]], offered in regular and bold weights is a homage to the streamline era
  of the later 1930s. It\u2019s a distinctive display family, glyphic yet still intuitive
  and easy to read. Use it anywhere you want that 30\u2019s streamlined feel, or perhaps
  in science fiction inspired work particularly those that have a \u2018past inspired
  future\u2019 feel...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zenia_4345.jpg]"

    me for straying off topic.)\r\n\r\nI like the Zenia tri-line.\r\nIt does have
    a kind of Brazil (the movie) vibe.\r\nAm I mistaken, or is this a departure from
    your usual fare? \r\nIt could be set in a specimen with more discretion, letterspaced,
    say, as a wordmark."

  body: "Nick - Zenia is a bit of a departure from m usual themes, though I''ve done
    a couple of other designs with a 30's inspired theme.  Glad you like it anyway.
    \ \r\n\r\nSometime I want to put in the effort to make up a proper specimen books
    of all my typeface families- the samples here are really just that, quick samples.\r\n\r\n"
