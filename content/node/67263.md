  body: Just use comic sans and papyrus - if your designs work with that, they should
    be able to work with just about any typeface... :-)

  body: "I try to be vary careful about licensing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should elaborate.\r\nMy
    client is buying me a copy of the font as I am their only designer. \r\nDue to
    time lags in purchase orders and invoice sign offs the font purchase can't be
    approved today. Is there a licensing issue I'm not understanding? As a friend
    to type designers and lover of type I would hate to make an incorrect move here.\r\nPlease
    share any insight you have into this matter. It would be greatly appreciated.\r\n"

  body: "Sorry, I was assuming the worst.\r\nBecause it is normal for the purchaser
    to receive a font licence, not a third party.\r\n\r\nWhy don't you just pay to
    licence the font yourself, and bill your client, as they are paying for it anyway?"

  body: Yes. That is normally my preference. Weird situation. Weird client. Ugh. Thanks
    for the response.

    relatively useless, because we\u2019re bound to suggest things that aren\u2019t
    likely to be residing on your hard drive. So then you you\u2019ll have to go purchase
    licenses yourself and what\u2019s the point of that, if the fonts are on their
    way? \r\n\r\nHow long is this \u201Cweird\u201D situation going to take? Are we
    talking weeks?!\r\n\r\nMight be more effective to list the options you have available
    to you currently and let the Typophiles kibitz on which will be the most suitable
    stand-ins.\r\n\r\nShould be entertaining."
