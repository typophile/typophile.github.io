  body: "To me this has echoes of <A href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?&q=Americana&x=20&y=11&sample_text=armes&update=0\">Americana</a>,
    as if perhaps this was drawn using Americana as an inspiration. Without any duplicated
    letters it is hard to be sure that this isn't hand-drawn.\r\n\r\nDo you have any
    other samples of this 'font'?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
