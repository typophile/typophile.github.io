  to the text face. I'm thinking Nick Shinn's lovely Scotch Modern. but is there something
  closer? Should I be looking for something with a tad more weight so as to more accurately
  resemble the letterpress/inking?\r\n\r\nReally appreciate any advice."

  body: "Yeah, it's a Scotch all right, and you can start from any one of a number
    of reasonably faithful digital revivals. Matching the ink spread could be difficult,
    as many digital versions have tiny hairlines. If you can use a font tool to add
    boldness with an outline, you might be able to get a lot closer.\r\n"
