  companies to create one unified mark. One mark uses Futura, the other Palace Script.
  In my eyes this isn't a combination that works. The business is luxury homes, so
  I would like update the type to create a sturdy, upmarket yet contemporary combination.
  And avoid the retro route!\r\n\r\nScripts are a particular weakness of mine, so
  particularly looking for suggestions on that front. I guess a high contrast black
  italic could work too. Any examples of contemporary sans/script combinations also
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    To keep it classic and luxurious, I think that a good choice of a script-like
    font would be something along the lines of [[http://favwork.com/FribergDesign/1518]]
    or another 1950-60s-esque font. Keep it classic.\r\n\r\nAs for pairing Futura
    with it, are they using Futura regular or condensed? If they're using condensed,
    try another condensed font like Bebas, Helvetica Neue Condensed, etc. I think
    that Helvetica would be a good pair with a script because of it's capital R's,
    but I understand if you don't want to use it for a logo since it is about as mainstream
    as it gets."

  body: "Thanks for the reply! And the suggestion, I think you are on to something
    there.\r\n\r\nThey are using regular at the moment, but I am looking to switch
    that over to a condensed face, as I think that will work better with the script.
    It should also help it feel a bit more solid. \r\n\r\nAny more for any more?"
