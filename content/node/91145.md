  body: "Looks like some form of Garamond because the \"T\" looks exactly like the
    one from the Adobe CS5.5 Master Collection (Adobe Garamond Pro). However, the
    \"&\" doesn't match exactly... And the \"e\" looks a little slanted. The \"t\"
    is also tapered off... Damn. I can't put my finger on it. I know I've seen it
    somewhere.\r\n\r\nIf you only care about the logo, you can probably get away with
    Garamond, maybe with a thicker stroke. The \"L\" has a white outline so the foot
    of the \"R\" gets overlapped."
