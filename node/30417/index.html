Is there a font that&rsquo;s easy for a beginner to emulate when learning to build letters? Also, is there a good book that explains the design of contemporary letterforms as opposed to those based on handwriting?

<p>Are you trying to work on Serifed type or Sans?</p>
<p>When I was learning what letters were all about, I would just open Times or Helvetica to get a sense of where the thicks and thins should be and why.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the sans faces that give me trouble. I can whip out a pen and draw serifed romans off the top of my head, but when I start trying to build sans letters out of strokes in illustrator my proportions get really gross.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try studying the designs of Futura and Helvetica.</p>

<p>If you can draw your characters on paper, scanning and tracing those isnt a too big step? Get your stroke width and such as right as possible in your drawings, and clean them up later when you&rsquo;ve traced them and when you&rsquo;re in FontLab/Illustrator.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re not familiar with bezier-curves, then I suggest you so some general exersizes first to get the feeling of the tool.  Like tracing a linedrawing of something, you know, things like that.
Letters are a difficult thing to do when you start&hellip; I&rsquo;ve noticed that, eventhough I do know bezier-curves quite well. But when it comes to drawing glyps with it, they aren&rsquo;t too smooth. (yet! ;))</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not really going to find one source that it is gonna be your bible. Get the Bringhurst book as well. I learned from Cabarga&rsquo;s book and Bringhurst. Once you get the basics down, I did what Choz suggested and cracked open some of my favorite fonts in FontLab to look at their digital construction. For me, drawing by hand didn&rsquo;t mean jack until I started digitizing.</p>

<p>The book is also very attractive, and I&rsquo;m happy to have it as part of my graphic design library. I don&rsquo;t think you have to be a type designer to appreciate it, just someone who is interested in type.</p>
