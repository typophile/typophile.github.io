body: "I am having trouble identifying this serif face taken from the Black Sails
  opening sequence. It has all the characteristics of a Garamond, but the very low
  chin on the capital G throws me off. The W is not in this sample, but if you check
  the video you will see it has the typical crossed strokes. The actual Black Sails
  logo at the end is Goudy Old Style, and the sans serif caps Alternate Gothic (unless
  it\u2019s Trade Gothic, still need to verify). \r\nhttps://vimeo.com/84162805\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jamin_black-sails_type_5947.jpg]"

    it\u2019s the actual design of the typeface. Ryu, you\u2019re a star! :)"

    Sails titling.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MVBCelestiaAntiquaONTESRGCKMWQ_4857.gif]\r\nAdobe
    classifies Celestia Antiqua as a Geralde Oldstyle. My question is what Geralde
    Oldstyle font with smooth rather than rough outlines comes closest to Celestia
    Antiqua.\r\nThanks.\r\nDon"

    comes closest to Celestia Antiqua -- at least for the upper case --  is Centaur?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CentaurInUseSimilarBlackSailsMovie_4578.gif]\r\nDon"
