    the very modern structures that work well on screen. \r\n\r\nThere is also this:
    \r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Merriweather&subset=latin\r\n\r\nI
    will be working on this design for the next 6 months+. Merriweather is a work
    in progress and will will be improved regularly. This means you can request improvements
    and even fund specific features if they are not already funded. \r\n\r\nFor more
    information and to stay updated you may want to grab the Flickr stream \r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/55990250@N02/\r\n\r\nand

  body: "Thanks Pablo! There are now 4 weights available. The fonts available now
    (May 16 2011)  will be replaced fairly soon with a newer set and then again finally
    with a set which has some elementary kerning as well.\r\n\r\nThe next set will
    be a set of 4 upright sans serifs. After that there will be italic for both the
    serif and the sans.\r\n"

    These fonts are betas. They will go alpha when it has all been tested together.\r\n\r\nI
    realize this is very very atypical and actually Thomas Phinney made some great
    points online about this essentially arguing that this method of releasing a font
    is intrinsically flawed. I basically agree with him now but that said - for now
    the course is set for this project. I will see it through. And if that means some
    re-flow occurs then that is the price of using a font that is meant for screens
    in a print project!\r\n\r\nThere are now 4 weights available to use - but problems
    with IE mean that only two of them are absolutely reliable. I am almost thinking
    of using a new name for the extreme weights ( assuming Google would be OK with
    such a thing). "

    arguing that this method of releasing a font is intrinsically flawed.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know - it seems like reflow is a normal price to pay if you want wide-spread
    beta-testing of a font, which is not a bad thing (especially if it's going to
    be free).\r\n\r\n> They will go alpha when it has all been tested together.\r\n\r\nWhat
    Craig said. During my college years I made up the term \"double-alpha\" to mean
    a program that was guaranteed to crash the moment you ran it. :-)  After beta
    you typically go \"rc\": release-candidate.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Richard - It means that you can't see the lightest (thin) and the heaviest
    (heavy/black) weights in IE because of a flaw in the way that IE interprets weight
    tags. I wish I knew if I was going to be able to adopt a work around. I am sure
    someone wants to pressure MS into doing the right thing and allowing fonts to
    have more than a binary set of possible weights in IE.\r\n\r\nRE: alpha beta -
    Oh! Sorry, I thought it was the other way around. I thought it was an alpha candidate
    when you thought it was 99.9 done. Thanks for the correction.\r\n\r\nFree or not
    free having things that are fairly broken floating around for nearly ever - (
    people don't update their fonts like they do software ) is a bit like making space
    junk. You can do it now... but eventually you will wish you had not. "
