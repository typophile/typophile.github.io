body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've been working on and off on this typeface for the last few
  months. While I did start creating one a few years ago, I'd consider this my first
  \"real\" attempt at a full font. While a lot of the details are more suited to display
  purposes, I'm also trying to make it work at smaller sizes (maybe a separate text
  version?). \r\n\r\nI haven't really shown it to many people yet and I'd like to
  know what you think and if it's worth continuing with. I'm mainly concerned about
  it looking too amateur-ish and wanted to know if there are any glaring beginner
  mistakes/things I've missed. \r\n\r\nI've drawn the upper and lowercase, some very
  basic punctuation but no numerals or diacritics yet as I first wanted some feedback
  on the letters/overall feel so far. I'm also figuring out Open Type along the way
  with some ligatures, stylistic alternates, possibly swash characters, but I'm only
  just beginning. \r\n\r\nThis is the regular weight and I'd to make light & bold
  weights and an italic at least to start with.  I've been working on the spacing
  for a while but it's still got a lot of fixing to do; there are some combinations
  I just can't seem to get right. There is no kerning or hinting yet (save for automatic
  hinting when generating).\r\n\r\nThanks very much in advance! It's really appreciated.\r\n\r\nClaire\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/qualtagh_3673.jpg]"

  body: "Hi Claire,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, don't be modest. Perhaps just a few percent
    of Typophile members are professional type designers, the rest of us are, just
    like you, enthousiasts. We all try our best and, as you said, hope to learn from
    each other. :-)\r\n\r\nAs for your design, I like it very much. It feels almost
    constructivist yet with subtle details. Overall I think that those details might
    be better off when you add some contrast (thick and thin). I feel that /s/ and
    /S/ are too wide, as well as /a/, which looks wider as /d/. /t/ is a bit too narrow.\r\n\r\nI
    can understand you're having difficulties spacing; the extra lines before /e/
    and after /d/ make it hard. But don't change them!\r\n\r\nKeep going!\r\n\r\nIf
    you're interested, please critisize my own design @ http://typophile.com/node/68295\r\n\r\nJean

  body: "Hi and thanks very much for your comments! \r\n\r\nI hadn't noticed the width
    of the upper and lowercase S but now that you mention it, it does stand out. I
    have progressively been adding some contrast (originally it had barely any) but
    I'm a little concerned the horizontal strokes on the top of the /a/, /g/ etc.
    might get too thin.. I'll play around with it though, well pointed out. \r\n\r\nI
    was unsure about those extra lines for a while, especially with the spacing difficulties,
    but without them it looks a little plain so I'm glad you recommend keeping them
    in!\r\n\r\nI had been following your earlier thread; I'll definitely have a look
    at the second part. \r\n\r\nThanks again!"
