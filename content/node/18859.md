body: "Hey, this is a background of a current 4th year research project I am studying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  have been researching into the term Democratisation of Information (accessibility
  of information to the general public). I came across thisterm as a result of an
  early interest in how western culture has become bombarded with information and
  how as a result of this it has become harder and harder to access accurate information.
  After thinking about the possibilities surrounding this term I came up with a selection
  of possible angles that proved to be somewhat inter-related with design, technology
  and information excess. They are,\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 Punctuation / language changes\r\n\u2022
  From page to screen (reading on screen vs. paper)\r\n\u2022 Aesthetics, the loss
  of tactile qualities on screen\r\n\u2022 Accessibility and value of design\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  began experiencing a significant amount of trouble narrowing this topic down, due\r\nof
  it's broad nature. So to progress I began to think about this situation from a different
  angle. Instead of focusing on the technological ramifications I decided to think
  about the implications that uncertainty is having on people. I am thinking about
  how western society has become terrorized by fear, whether concerning national security,
  road safety, protection of public health, natural disasters, etc. and how \"every
  form of risk is ever-present, contagious, and needs to be accounted for or immediately
  eradicated\". From here I have begun to think about how \"safety and security obsessions
  are leaving behind ever-more-visible traces, especially in public spaces, in the
  form of smoke-free zones, surveillance cameras\" etc. With the information I am
  gathering I intend to interpret fear and space through typographic exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone has any comments to make on possible angles for this, it would be much appreciated.\r\n"

  body: "Fear and uncertainty in these United States tend to be handled in different
    ways by different groups. Those with \"religious\" inclinations tend to retreat
    deeper into dogma, because all Western religions claim to be in possession of
    absolute truth and describe a <em>temenos</em> where the elect may collectively
    ward off the fear. This trend is evidenced by the growing influence of right-wing
    Christian groups in the political arena.\r\n\r\nA great many of those who walk
    no dogma simply ignore--or, at least, attempt to ignore--the fear and uncertainty,
    and retreat into their own little worlds, a task that has been made far easier
    by the increasing availability of portable electronic devices. Look in any public
    place and you will find cell-phone performance artists, Blackberry or Palm Pilot
    junkies, or iPod <em>isolatos</em>--all intensely wrapped up in their own personal
    little worlds, and increasingly oblivious to the presence (and rights and needs)
    of others.\r\n\r\nBoth responses contribute to the dissolution of the social fabric:
    the pious by drawing lines between the saved and the damned, and the clueless
    by being, well, clueless.\r\n\r\nHow do you interpret this typographically? I'm
    not sure, but it looks like we're in deep Dada to me..."

    were, don't be too short sighted. You can make a more meaningful analysis is you
    study a longer historical period: more time, more changes.\r\n\r\nInformation
    is not less accurate now than ... when? Consider how patent medicines (eg Cure
    for Cancer etc.) used to be advertised c.1900. First, some magazines stopped accepting
    ads for them, then they were legally prohibited. Was fear of death, particularly
    infant mortality, any more palpable in those days, when it was more likely than
    today? How could it be, given that people adapt to the norm?\r\n\r\nIt's very
    easy to deal in generalizations, but all you're doing is gossiping. A tightly
    focused typography study would give you the chance to get specific, and see whether
    this idea of \"bombarded with information\" holds any water. \r\n\r\nI think it's
    a myth, and that corporate concentration, narrowcasting and tightly focued demographic
    marketing lessen the amount of information people receive. But if you are going
    to study the idea, surely you would have to do some kind of statistical comparison
    of (a) then and now? Or else you will just end up recycling the usual cliches,
    which is bombarding your professors with familiar information. "

    terrorized by fear, how does it compare to the threat of nuclear annihilation
    during the Cold War?  What about xenophobic reactions to Irish, German, Japanese,
    Russian, Central European, Mexican immigrants, among countless others?  If it
    has become harder to access accurate information, what about pre-internet days?
    \ What about pre-telecommunication days?  Certainly the Hearst publishing empire
    didn't operate by accurate, dispassionate journalism.  \r\n\r\nI think you have
    some strong assumptions at the heart of your project, and I'm not saying that
    they're wrong, just that they need to be identified and examined as you find the
    direction your project will take.\r\n\r\nAlso, would it be possible for you to
    elaborate a bit more on your bullet points above?  I'm not quite sure what they
    mean in this context.\r\n\r\n--Jim K."

      In many cases, it is astounding what information is available. I can access
      the latest findings in the field of quantum physics at MIT. And in spite of
      what the major media wants me to think, I can find plenty of the missing info
      on any subject.\r\n\r\nIf you mean that there is more deceit now, I wholeheartedly
      agree. \r\n(Hey! Where are we going, and why are we in this handbasket?)\r\nIt
      part of the general breakdown that is sure to occur when morality is relative,
      and corrupt natures are allowed to rationalize to their hearts content.\r\n\r\nHow
      this relates to fonts? I'll leave that to hrant, who is sure to have strong

        the post says this was an initial area of interest that is somewhat inter-related

        on the four angles that came from researching the democratisation fo information,
        but they are related in certain respects.\r\n\r\nSince the main post my angle

    Relativism, the idea that there is no truth, is something I don't think many people
    agree with; on the other hand pluralism, the idea that many different value systems
    can all be equally valid, seems to be fairly prevalent, at least on the intarweb.
    I think when you're exposed to viewpoints of people across the world, you start
    to see how even though two philosophies are different - even contradictory - they
    can still express the same universal human truths.\r\n"

    It's very hard to blame one's-self, especially for something abstract like the

    we accept that we are limited, we become less oppressed. We are told to daydream
