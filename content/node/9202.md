  think&#41;. I&#39;ve unsuccessfully run software over it but nothing close came
  up. Any ideas... <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65147.gif"

  body: There&#39;s something maddeningly familiar about this, but I just can&#39;t
    place it. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a font. There&#39;s a bit of Coronet in
    there, but it&#39;s definitely not that. I can also a bit of Trafton Script, but
    again even less of a match. I have a strong suspicion that this is the italic
    of a roman face like Bodoni, but again I draw a blank. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve picked
    a doozy, Paul. It&#39;s stumped me, anyway.

  body: I&#39;ve been looking at this one too. My first impulse is that they took
    a script font, but replaced the &#39;r&#39; letters with an italic from another
    font.  <BR> <BR>The script font I thought it resembled was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/ballantines-script/ef-demi-bold/testdrive.html?s=prairie+style&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank">Ballantines Script</a> &#40;a.k.a. Dianna&#41;. I can see that
    the &#39;y&#39; and &#39;s&#39; aren&#39;t quite right, but someone who knows
    how to tweak a font might have started with this style.

  body: Doing some more hunting, and I still think the &#39;r&#39; comes from a different
    font, but I think the rest of the script comes from an old Z-series film type
    script. I have a German Script Font book from 1993, and it shows that a company
    called Typo Bach in Frankfurt and Munich was using a bunch of those Z-name fonts
    that show up in the Solotype Catalog. It turns out that Zither &#40;Solotype Catalog
    p. 95&#41; is nearly identical, except that the loop on the &#39;y&#39; in the
    sample is bigger &#40;and the &#39;r&#39; is a true script &#39;r&#39;&#41;. It&#39;s
    a better match than Ballantine&#39;s Script, which I now see has a slight bend
    in the vertical stems. In the Photo-Lettering Catalog this was called &#39;Nightingale
    Script&#39;, I think.  <BR> <BR>Turns out that Zither was apparently digitized
    by Opti, and possibly by Dan Solo, because I have a sample in the Script Font
    ID Guide &#40;below&#41;:<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65213.gif"
    alt="Zither sample"> <BR> <BR>I will make a larger sample of &#39;prairie style&#39;
    using OptiZither, and post it shortly.

  body: Ok. Here is my crude attempt to use OptiZither to reproduce this sample. I
    used the &#39;r&#39; from Times Roman. What it shows me is that I may not have
    the exact Z-script that was used for the original, but the method seems credible
    to me. As you know with film type, lenses could be used to rotate the slant of
    the type, so my backslanting may approximate what was done. I think it was done
    to make the italic &#39;r&#39; fit, and I think they may have used a different
    &#39;r&#39; because the original letter looked wrong stylistically, was harder
    to read, or they just wanted a more vertical style and the r didn&#39;t work well
    that way. Who knows? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65218.gif"

  body: Wow! Thanks Mike - that&#39;s very helpful. I was coming to the same conclusion
    that it could be a mix of typefaces. The funny thing is - I was in the supermarket
    last night and saw a box of Lindt chocolates. The Lindt logo font looked a lot
    like this prarie style. Anyone know the font used by Lindt? Otherwise I will look
    at Ballantyne Script &amp; OPTI Zither.
