body: "We are getting a logo redesigned, and when we asked the designer what font
  he used, he said \"Untitled Regular\" and attached a font file with nothing in it.
  \ This should have been a warning. \r\n\r\nI got him to send a screenshot of the
  font page, and have attached that, but I have already tried Identifont, WhatTheFont,
  and any other font things I could find.\r\n\r\nAfter going through Identifont's
  \"similar fonts\", I have gotten this far:\r\nIt is not Camphor, but that's the
  closest I could find - the numbers are all wrong, and I think the font is thinner
  than Camphor.\r\nIt is not Frutiger Next - the j is rounder, the dots are round
  not square, the N might be wider, and the numbers don't match.\r\nIt is not Motiva
  - the ends of the C's are flat, not angled, and the numbers don't match.\r\nIt is
  not Proxima Nova - the numbers again, and also the shape of the lowercase a.\r\n\r\nStumped.
  \ Stumped stumped stumped.  If we get no answer, I am not sure what to do - request
  a different font on the logo?  I am 98% sure the designer does not know what font
  it is.  But we like the logo in the end.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU!\r\nSheri Cheng (new member
  and font-o-phile)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mystery Font-1379442415_5681.jpg]"

  body: Yeah, it's not that either, as the 1 is different in the numbers, but that
    is another close option that I might be able to ask the designer to use instead.

  body: Sorry, it's in fact Segoe WP. I think they may have also updated Segoe UI
    for Windows 8, to match the WP version.

title: NOT Frutiger Next, Camphor, Motiva, or Proxima Nova.  But close.
