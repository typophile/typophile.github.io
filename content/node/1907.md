  body: hmm... <BR> <BR>   I don&#39;t know what to say. I think maybe you want to  <BR>scrap
    it, and start anew. Do you want to capture the  <BR>meaning of the word at all
    in the letterforms you  <BR>design? The geometric shapes work for a construction  <BR>company,
    but not for communications,and not divine. <BR> <BR>   The forms are looking very
    randomly generated to me.  <BR>The &#34;E&#34; is very squared off. It bothers
    me the most.  <BR>I can almost make it say diving. The &#34;V&#34; and second
    &#34;I&#34; are  <BR>most proportionate, so if you continue, I would work off
    of  <BR>those 2 letters. just duplicate the second &#34;I&#34; for the first.  <BR>The
    &#34;D,N,E&#34; must be condensed. Overall,  <BR>#5 shows the most promise. <BR>
    <BR>   There is really not enough playing going on. Maybe  <BR>draw, scan and
    trace for a bit before digitizing? <BR> <BR>Why did you choose the word Divine?  I
    am also curious.  <BR>I&#39;d like to see the final version of any progression  <BR>you
    decide to make. <BR> <BR>Good Luck, <BR> <BR>Andrew <BR> <BR> <BR>

    letterforms in ancient manuscripts. I see nothing constructiony about this. '

  body: 'Yves: <BR> <BR>As I mentioned in my first posting and as Andrew confirmed,
    these letterforms are not yet closely related. It looks like at least three different
    typefaces have been thrown into the mix. In addition it doesn&#39;t look like
    there has been an attempt to equalize their weight. <BR> <BR>I agree with Kemie,
    therefore, I disagree with Andrew regarding the appropriateness of the look. I
    think the forms, although somewhat unrelated to each other, do a pretty good job
    capturing the concept of divinity. I think you just need to focus in on one of
    the forms and make sure the rest work with it. <BR> <BR>Like Darrel, I mentioned
    previously that the &#34;i&#39;s&#34; dots are too light. The squared dots that
    Adriano illustrated work better, but considering the word you might try finding
    a dingbat to use as the dots'
