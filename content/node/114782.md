body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI am a final year student at Nottingham Trent University, desperate
  for some primary research for my dissertation on typography.\r\nI was wondering
  if anyone could offer their opinion on any of the following questions...\r\n\r\nIs
  typography a craft?\r\nHas the quality of type design been affected by digitization?\r\nAre
  all new typefaces just an imitation of existing designs or is it still possible
  to achieve original type design?\r\nHas the internet become saturated with poor
  quality type design?\r\nIs it possible to avoid?\r\nWhat defines good typography?\r\n\r\nAny
  help or comments you may give will be extremely helpful and much appreciated.\r\nThank
  you,\r\nSophie Metcalfe"
