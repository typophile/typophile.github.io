body: "Im on my schools computer and ran across some strange font files. . . im attempting
  to simply browse them and use them in my project comps.\r\n\r\nthe file types are
  . . . \r\n\r\n.afm\r\n\r\n.inf\r\n\r\n.pfb\r\n\r\n.pfm\r\n\r\nNever heard of these
  types of files. I looked at adobe type manager lite and it only runs on older OS
  versions. . .but still dont know if that has anything to do with this situation.
  \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames"
