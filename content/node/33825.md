  a better look at the specific typeface I'm interested in:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C3_organisation_Logo-zoomed_6292.png]\r\n\r\nWhatTheFont
  has it pegged as Skopex Gothic. It looks sort of similar to my sample, but it's
  not the same. Any better guesses from the board?\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n"

  body: This font is a lightened DIN font. (Guess it comes from the FontShop cut :)).
    There is such a light DIN font from a familly called "WAC Mittleschrift". Unfortunatelly
    I don't know where to find it.

  body: Maybe I am reading you wrong, harrisson, but the type hasn't been "lightened"
    for the logo. It's actually FF DIN Light, straight out of the box.

    only managed to OCR-guess one or two glyphs.
