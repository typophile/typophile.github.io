body: "I'm unsure of the best way to present this paragraph. The first has oldstyle
  figures and the second has lining. \r\nThere's a mix of currency (R), numbers, percentages
  and times of day. \r\n\r\nTo my eye the lining figures look neatest, but perhaps
  I should think about using oldstyle because it's part of an extended block of text
  where there will be other numerals dotted around. \r\n\r\nI've turned the am and
  pm into small caps and now wonder if the R (rand) currency symbol should be a small
  cap too (if I go with OSF). Is it conventional to have the currency symbol before
  the numeral or after?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SA info_6662.jpg]\r\nWhat's
  the general preference?\r\n\r\n(And I've just noticed that hyphen between Cape Town
  and Simon's Town, which I'll change to the word 'to'.)"

  body: "Hi Bendy\r\n\r\nDefinitely o/s numerals with the small caps, and this nice
    classy face.\r\nFor the \"R8\" I'd manually decrease the height of the R about
    10% I don't know that a true small-cap will be appropriate there.\r\n\r\nFor the
    phone number you might consider changing 'Tel' to small caps as well. \r\n\r\nIf
    you do end up with the lining, be sure to bump the hypens up a half-point or so
    ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nPeter\r\n\r\nhttp://slowprint.com/almostfreelp (Almost Free

  body: "Seconded.\r\n\r\nI think the hyphen in Cape Town - Simon's Town is confusing
    too. Makes me think you are making an aside. The word \"to\" would work better."
