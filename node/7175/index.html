		<div class="commentbody">I don't think this thread really belongs in the Build section, which perhaos is why no one has responded to it. It doesn't, so far, touch upon the implications of ClearType rendering for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->making<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a 'sweet spot' for ClearType rendering which is somewhere around 130dpi. At this resolution, the pixels are small enough for the visible artifacts of the subpixel colour filtering to largely disappear. Below that resolution, e.g. at the old Windows norm of 96dpi the physical pixels are too large for the technology to produce optimal results: the text will still look more faithful to the individual type design, but the fuzz is likely to be noticeable. I used a Toshiba laptop with a native resolution of 133dpi for the past couple of years, and ClearType works very well on this machine. I recently switched to a Dell with a resolution of 146dpi and, of course, ClearType looks even better. I've also seen it in use at 200dpi, and this is really splendid: actually better than quite a lot of what passes for printing these days. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note, also, that you can tune the ClearType rendering system on your computer to get the best results for a) your monitor's native gamma and b) your personal colour sensitivity. See <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/1.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/1.htm</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> for more information.

		<div class="commentbody">Dominik, ClearType is really designed as a technology for LCD screens. It works by effectively increasing the x-direction resolution by addressing the individual RGB sub-pixels in an LCD pixel. On a CRT screen, the pixels are not composed of discreet sub-pixels; rather, the colour value of the whole pixel is adjusted to display different colours. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interestingly, and for reasons that are not completely understood, many people do find a slight improvement in font rendering using ClearType on a CRT screen, as compared to traditional greyscale antialiasing. The effect is quite minor, and the best guess as to why it seems an improvement is that ClearType is leaking small amounts of colour into adjacent CRT pixels, and this makes curves smoother than with traditional antialiasing. Because CRT is not the target technology for ClearType, little study has been made of its affect on CRT screens.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One last thing: about CT versus non-CT comparisons, what has always seemed hoaky to me is the use of italics type to exhibit the advantages of CT. We rarely read italics type continuously.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Using italics is useful to show immediate and obvious benefit of ClearType to the rendering of traditionally difficult diagonal strokes. It is pretty obvious that ClearType makes italics more readable, because it maintains the structure of the letters, which is broken in the stepped b/w bitmap, and the notan, which lost in greyscale. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So that is a basic improvement in both the aesthetic and functional aspects of one particular kind of type on screen, and it is an obvious improvement easily relatable to the increased x-direction resolution, which has made it useful in showing how ClearType works. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personally, I tend not to use italics in my comparisons, because I already <!-- raw HTML omitted -->know<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that italics are going to look better and be more readable under ClearType.

		<div class="commentbody">This looks good, Hrant. But you have made it a bit easier for yourself by making the stroke weight of the roman two-pixels, and effectively two pixels for the italic too. The effective weight of the ClearType is somewhere between one and two pixels, which I think is preferable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You may find the image below interesting.

		<div class="commentbody">What's interesting is that you can do a tradeoff between the &quot;integerness&quot; of weight, and crispness. In an italics, since you have to give up very crisp forms anyway, you actually acquire the ability to deviate from integer weight wihout any [additional] penalty. So I can make my italics slightly lighter or darker pretty easily. However, you're right to imply that a proper relationship with the roman has to be maintained, and making the italics too light would be bad (especially since my angle* is already strong). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some related stuff: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I like to have stroke contrast; and -as I implied above- a 2-pixel stem font isn't necessarily too dark since it can have 1-pixel horizontals; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I could make the Roman lighter too (if also less crisp); <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Using a lighter weight for emphasis in running text isn't so bad - not as bad as the other way around. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Crispness can actually be a differentiation technique. It's possible that the best companion to a grayscale Roman is a b&amp;w italic, or&hellip; shudder&hellip; a b&amp;w upright cursive! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* The angle is actually dictated by the medium to a fair degree, btw. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then there's the issue of what weight looks good - and that depends on effective resolution greatly. I think the color in your &quot;best&quot; (3rd row) italic is very good. But maybe a 2-pixel stem weight with looser spacing would be comparable? Anyway, ideal color needs to be worked into the equation with everything else, like chromatism, crispness, etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; there is no grey <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->True, but you could say that the three channels in a [properly calibrated] display are defined as producing no color when lighted with equal [numeric] intensity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>
