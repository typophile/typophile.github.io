body: "Hi all,\r\nI've been working on a new script font named dearJoe 5 and I am
  encountering a problem I've never seen before: After manually kerning the whole
  thing I am now testing the font (in Photoshop etc.) and I notice that in some letter
  combinations, when they overlap, the letters are not displayed correctly. Where
  the overlap is, the color is inverted: what should be black shows as white. When
  not overlapping all characters seem fine.\r\nNow I could not find the solution myself
  and I hope it's something simple like a problem with the contours but really I couldn't
  tell. \r\nSo my question is: what could cause this problem, how do I solve this
  and is there a way to check all characters at once for this error?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot for helping me out on this.\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nJoe"

    is the RIGHT direction and is there a way in which to treat the whole font at
    once to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJoe"
