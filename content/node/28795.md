body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am developing an identity for a company called One-1 (the request
  was to use either \"ONE\", \"1\" or a combination of both) at the moment I am at
  an early stage of development and would like to look at alternative fonts from the
  current one that I have chosen (just to see what works).\r\n\r\nIn terms of design
  this (attached gif) is the direction I am taking at the moment (although if looks
  very similar to another identity you are aware of please let me know)\r\n\r\nThe
  fonts used are \"Reforma Grotesk Demi\" for the ONE and \"Reforma Grotesk Medium\"
  for the 1 the use of medium to bring the kerning a little closer. The key for the
  font is not to thin and the number 1 requires the curve at the top (sorry don't
  know the technical name here) the curves just gives that little bit more recognition
  to the number then a straight variation.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on alternatives that
  I should try out - anything more modern would be good. One-1 is a fitness / personal
  training company.\r\n\r\nTIA"

    Cocon</a> for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cocon_6343.gif]\r\nI
    thpought the number 1 was a bit hard to fin. I think it could be more obvious.
    How about shoving the 'E' behind the '1'?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/one1_5390.gif]"

  body: "Hi Alex,\r\n\r\nCould try a curvy font but I think the roundness of the E
    would make the 1 even harder to \"see\" - I'm am not worried about the 1 being
    to obvious I like that you may have to work for it - don't really I follow \"shoving
    the 1 behind the E\" comment - what do you mean?"

    the vert stem of the E narrower, and the moving the letter e bit to the left.

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions guys - may have a look at Klavika (nice) but try
    a different 1 to contrast and retain the top curve.\r\n\r\nAlex I hadn't tried
    lowercase as it didn't have the uprights - that said if I look at your suggestion
    of \"putting\" the number 1 infront of the \"e\" it would give me a straight edge
    and possibly the illusion of the 1 - I'll give it a try as a variation, cheers."
