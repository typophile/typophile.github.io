  how that kind of fonts manage the equal width size for \"i\" and \"m\" the same?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  and sorry! :D"

  body: "I don't know how \"superb\" it is, but...\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you're not
    clear on the meaning of \"kerning\".\r\n\r\nEvery character in a font has a certain
    width. These widths are where the normal spacing in a font comes from.\r\n\r\nIn
    a proportional font, these widths vary, depending on the <em>proportions</em>
    of the character. So, as you mention, the \"i\" and the \"m\" would be different
    widths.\r\n\r\nIn a monospaced font--also called non-proportional--, the characters
    are all made to fit into the same width. So, the \"i\" is made wider, or has more
    space around it, and the \"m\" is made narrower.\r\n\r\nKerning is a method of
    adjusting the spacing between certain pairs of characters, such as \"A\" and \"T\",
    for which the normal spacing is too loose or too tight. A monospaced font would
    never have kerning pairs.  If it did, it would, in effect, cause some characters
    to have different widths, and then it wouldn't be monospaced anymore."

  body: "There are also mono style fonts which are made to give the look of a mono
    without actually being one. They have different widths and probably kerning as
    well but of course then, by definition they are not Monospaced.\r\n\r\nIt is not
    easy to make the width of the m & i that same. But if you look a many Monospaced
    fonts you will begin to see what the strategies being used are.\r\n\r\nYou may
    also ant to look at the Wiki\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/12054?\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/12410?\r\n\r\nThe
    last wiki entry also has links to relevant threads "

    is \"typewriter-like\" with the emphasis on the \"like\" part. It isn't monospaced
    like the typewriter fonts it imitates.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "If you want to have a set of glyphs that will set both monowidth and proportionally
    spaced, then kerning will do the trick.\r\n\r\nOf course, the glyph widths should
    be all the same.\r\nNext, kern the font.\r\nSo, \"kerned\" will be the default.
    (But not in Word.)\r\nBut if a typographer wants monospaced, then all that is
    required is to enter \"0\" in the kern field of the Character palette in InDesign.\r\n\r\nIt
    would be possible to do it the other way round, i.e. to kern a proportionately
    spaced font to set as though it were monospace, however, there would be a problem
    at the beginning of lines.\r\n\r\nThe easiest thing to do is two separate fonts,
    one monospaced, one proportional.\r\n\r\nI have actually had requests for a kerned
    (proportional spaced) version of Panoptica, but as the whole raison d'\xEAtre
    of that typeface is to be monospaced-unicase, to provide a proportional version
    would negate its personality."
