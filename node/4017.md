body: I have been reading with pleasure the discussions here on this board for some
  time and decided to jump into the fray even though I&#39;m just a hobbyist in this
  field. <BR> <BR>I was wondering what measuring system designers and typographers
  now use.  Do people still use the traditional British and American mesaure &#40;point
  = 0.3515 mm&#41; or the PostScript &#40;Adobe&#41; point &#40;= 0.3528 mm, precisely
  1/72 inch&#41;? What is the &#34;default&#34; measure now when you talk about points
  and picas without specifying what system is used? <BR>It is all rather confusing
  and f.ex. Bringhurst, in The elements of typographic style, doesn&#39;t mention
  which measure he uses in his text &#40;although it seems to be that he uses the
  old one&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: Thanks for the answers. I suspected that this was the case. There is certainly
    not a lot of difference between the two systems &#40;old system, 1 inch = 6.02
    picas, new system 1 inch = 6 picas&#41; but there is a difference all the same.
    Do you know if the  Didot points have also disappeared?

  body: 'I love points, picas and inches only because of the coherence of the system:
    the number 12 multiples allow you to get a module every single pica line, or every
    six 14 pt lines, or every three 8 pt lines ..... and the harmony is never lost.
    I can'
