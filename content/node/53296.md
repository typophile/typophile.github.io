  body: "For a start:\r\nS and R are too wide. The head of R is too big and too wide.
    There is too much weight difference on the S, make it more monoline. The upper
    curve could be shallower. A is too narow. E too wide. K too narrow, the upward
    stroke should sit higher. What happened to the H, man? Wasn\u2019t there enough
    space? It\u2019s the narrowest letter in there, very awkward.\r\nThe spacing is
    very tight. Not a problem at this size, but if it\u2019s going to be set smaller.\r\n\r\nBest,
    J\xFCrgen"

    I think the R is what makes it charming. Thoughts?"

  body: "Good improvements.\r\nThe break from horizontal to curved in the D seems
    too abrupt.\r\nIs this the size it'll be? I find the ink traps a little distracting."

  body: At this size, the S looks somewhat thin in terms of stroke width.

  body: "In addition to the two comments above:\r\nThe head of R hangs down (bottom
    curve), the leg is too light.\r\nK: upward stroke a touch lighter, downward stroke
    a touch heavier and a bit steeper.\r\n\r\nIf it will be for lots of different
    sizes, i would do a version without ink traps for display sizes."
