  body: "No match at the moment, not even a name. I firstly thought as COS is a sub-brand
    of H&M, it could have been [[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=site:typophile.com/node+hm+ampersand|Ampersand]]
    (sample [[http://www.typesample.com/samples/Y9ehZ|here]]). HM Ampersand is very
    close to [[http://playtype.com/index.php?q=node/139|Du Nord]] designed by Jonas
    Hecksher. Reminds me a bit of [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik|Graphik]]
    too. My guess would be (a very common usage with Scandinavian companies/designs),
    they may have commissioned a Northern Europe foundry/design firm like [[http://playtype.com|Playtype]],
    [[http://www.a2-type.co.uk|A2-Type]], [[https://monokrom.no|Monokrom]], [[http://www.schick-toikka.com|Schick
    Toikka]] or maybe Swiss (Lineto, Optimo, Grilli Type, Milieu Grotesque...) but
    I'm surely missing a lot.\r\nFound also 2 more ones, somehow similar: [[http://www.newrailalphabet.co.uk|New
    Rail Alphabet]] and [[http://www.a2-type.co.uk/html/regular_light.html|Regular]]
    both designed by A2-Type (their designers have also worked for Playtype)."

    checked their website but only 'Aper\xE7u' with the assumption it couldn't have
    been one of their typefaces as they almost all look a bit odd/quirky/hipster-ish
    (like Radim Pesko's) and your sample was not.\r\nMy 2 cent now. I'm obsessed by
    typefaces but this one not. To me (but doesn't want to sound blase), it's \"just\"
    another re-interpretation of Helvetica (like Ampersand). Earmarks have been erased
    (/R leg, /a counter...) and faux-monospace treatment has been applied. For the
    rest, Graphik looks far better to my eyes."
