    some unidentified Frutiger-like ... yeah, <i>what</i> is it? Yuck.

    <BR> <BR>Yves, what&#39;s funny is that the other posters must be better. Generally,
    Oscar posters are gaudy and glamorous but most of the time the typography is well
    considered and &#34;elegant&#34; in that hollywood way. This poster is clearly
    the work of system fonts. There is nothing unique about the poster&#39;s typography,
    much less the illustration which seems like a quick posterization/threshold in
    Photoshop. I like the &#34;color&#34; idea, I just don&#39;t like those colors.  <BR>
    <BR>So, no idea what type &#34;Oscar&#34; is? I can&#39;t believe the master is
    stumped!'

    it was to begin with. BTW, I actually think that poster is Good Design, because
    it perfectly matches what Oscars Night really is... <BR> <BR>hhp
