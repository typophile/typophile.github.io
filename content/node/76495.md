  is not just an empty space but instead has an element in it.\r\nit does get displayed
  when i write it in indesign for example but not doesnt work in aftereffects.\r\nIn
  after effects just a blnk appears , also in indesign when i transform letters into
  paths the element in the space disappears!\r\nWould be great if anybody would know
  a solution to  this as i really dont know what to do with this anymore!"

  body: "This was discussed a while ago -- perhaps some googling will turn up the
    thread.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time: the space has sort of a special status in typesetting.
    As remarked in another thread, LaTeX doesn't even <em>have</em> a space \"glyph\",
    it calculates the space (in the 2-dimensional meaning) between two characters
    and 'moves' the rest of the text to the right.\r\n\r\nThe older thread discusses
    the 'meaning' of a dedicated space glyph as well as the repercussions it has on
    typesetting -- f.i., what should happen if your space should be compressed or
    expanded to justify a line?\r\n\r\nI think the best solution would be to move
    the glyph to another character -- any one will do, but you might prefer to have
    it accessible with a standard keyboard. What standard keyboard character can you
    do without? Tilde, perhaps?"

    the problem either or?\r\nIsnt it possible to give the space something like a

  body: "in my font i have somthing called \"BEIN HADVEKIM\" where the space is substituted
    to an alternate glyph.\r\n\r\nIn turns out that even though the alternate glyph
    is displayed, the width does not change, meaning that indesign traets this glyph
    as a width value glyph and not a glyph he should display.\r\n\r\nin other words,
    indesign reads the with of the space and uses it in the text level, so even though
    i substitute the glyph, the value that indesign uses for the text is the original
    space and not the width of the substituted glyph"

  body: "<cite>Isnt it possible to give the space something like a real value so it
    works just as a regular glyph?</cite>\r\n\r\nA space has a \"real value.\" In
    every font. Think it through. InDesign, for example, lets you modify a character's
    width (scaling), sidebearings (tracking), etc. Why should a space be different?\r\n\r\nApplication
    programs that don't permit this with all characters still allow it with a space,
    just as long as they allow justified setting. That's where your complaint about
    \"a value\" lies . . . with setting justified copy. And that has nothing to do
    with the font, it's all the business of the layout program.\r\n\r\n<cite>oh and

  body: "@charles_e: after effect is a programm for making movies or rather sequences
    to make movies of. It basically the movie equivalent to photoshop! so basically
    my typeface blank doesnt work in aftereffects but the blank of this other typeface
    does! what is TeX? is it like a setting i can activate?\r\nalso it might be important
    to say again that the filled blank works in indesign fine until i convert all
    letters into paths,thats when it dissappears insteat of converting the element
    of the space aswell. in after effects it doesnt even work from the start."

    use is completely different than any of the software I have experience with.

  body: "When I had this same problem, I inserted an alternate space glyph in the
    calt OT feature, like this:\r\n\r\n<code>feature calt {\r\n  sub space by space.alt;\r\n}
    calt;</code>\r\n\r\nThe result can be seen [[http://myfonts.us/aYz0ww|here.]]
    Make sure you turn on the \u201CContextual Alternate\u201D mark in the Advanced
    Typography panel (the ff icon). It works fine in InDesign even when you outline
    the text since InDesign supports the calt feature, but I am afraid After Effects
    doesn\u2019t (I don\u2019t work with that software, sorry).\r\n\r\nSo if you really
    need that glyph in After Effects, the best solution can be, as Theunis said, moving
    this alternate glyph into another, not-so-important slot."
