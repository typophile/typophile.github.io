body: I've been looking here and Google for a little while now, and I am still having
  trouble finding what font was used for the logo on MacGyver.  Was this one of those
  custom hand-drawn logos, or is it a font (based on a font)?  Any help/answers are
  greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance everyone!

  body: "The show was on starting in 1985, which is mostly pre-digital for fonts,
    so I looked in books of film types (even though I don't know if this logo dates
    to the start of the show). I can't say I found anything that jumped out at me
    as the answer. The G and C are sort of like Copperplate Gothic, but with a Latin-looking
    serif, although the other letters seem to have only the barest suggestion (if
    any) of serifs. The closest typeface I found with a slightly similar G (Orchard
    Wide, in the Photo-Lettering catalog) was similar in general feel and letterforms,
    except that it had an A that was flattened on top, or had a top serif, as did
    most of the A's in other similar fonts. Many of these other fonts also had a leg
    on the R that was more separated from the stem, unlike your logo. \r\n\r\nI know
    my collection of film type references is far from comprehensive, but I was at
    a loss to find anything very close. This makes me want to say 'custom', and yet
    I wonder whether they would have cared enough to pay for custom lettering, given
    the transience and riskiness of TV series. Maybe someone with a better selection
    of older typefaces can pin this down, but if I was given the task of re-creating
    it, and the condition that I had to start with an existing font, I think I would
    use <A href=\"http://www.treacyfaces.com/050806_TFArrow_2c5a.html\">TF Arrow</a>,
    which I think was the closest in general shape I could think of. I'd have to modify
    the C and G, but I think it wouldn't be too much work, and might give something
    close enough to pass casual inspection.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
