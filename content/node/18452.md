    touch the "l". You've got something there that looks a little bit like a cap "A".

  body: "You can also type \"/f_l int\" (note the space after /f_l). The slash is
    required so FLS knows \"f_i\" is the glyph name not three individual glyphs.\r\n\r\nIf
    your \"l\" and the \"l\" in \"f_l\" are not too different, you might create a
    kern class with \"l\" as base glyph and then kern the \"l\" only. So: \"_l_1:
    d l' f_l f_f_l\".\r\nIn this example, the first \"_\" in the class name indicates
    to FLS that it's a kern class. The \"l\" in the class name reminds you of the
    base glyph (which you have to kern in FLS). And the \"_1\" [one] is a hint that
    this is a leftside-of-a-pair-class, or first class. (A rightside-of-a-pair-class
    would have \"_2\" at the end.)\r\nRight from the start, for a kerning class containing
    \"I\" \"Idotaccent\" \"Igrave\" \"H\", you should prepare TWO classes nevertheless
    -- one for \"I\" \"Idotaccent\" \"Igrave\" \"H\" being the first glyph of a pair,
    one for them being the second glyph of a pair (\"_I_1: I' Idotaccent Igrave H\"
    and \"_I_2: I' Idotaccent Igrave H\"). Anything else would bring you into trouble
    when compiling the kern feature later."

    wonder if you could elaborate a bit on what you mean by \"ligatures that have
    their own postscript names\". The authoritative source, Adobe Glyph List for New
    Fonts (http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/aglfn13.txt ) does
    not list any single of those you quote. \r\n\r\nThe legacy Adobe Glyph List 2.0
    (http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/glyphlist.txt ) includes
    ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl but not st. But that said, these are considered legacy names
    since they're absent from AGLFN. According to AGLFN, you should use the algorithmic
    names (f_f, f_i, f_l, f_f_i, f_f_l, s_t) in all cases. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Of course if you use the names like \"fi\" or \"fl\" for the standard ligatures,
    it won't break anything. The difference between AGLFN (Adobe Glyph List for New
    Fonts, http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/aglfn13.txt ) and
    AGL2 (Adobe Glyph List 2.0, http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/glyphlist.txt
    ) is that the first lists the recommended glyph names (\"best picks\", so to say)
    while the second also lists \"legacy\" names that will also be understood. For
    Unicode codepoints not listed in the AGLFN, you need to follow the algorithmic
    approach that is discussed in the \"Editing Fonts\" chapter, \"Glyph Naming and
    Character Encoding\" section of the FontLab Studio 5 manual. \r\n\r\nA."
