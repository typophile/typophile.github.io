body: "In FontLab, using the \"Drawing Tool\" (the button with the pen icon and plus
  sign) results in superfluous BCPs created on straight line corner nodes. Anyone
  know how to prevent the extra handles from being created?\r\n\r\nFor example, reading
  the FontLab manual, for drawing lines using the Drawing Tool: \"add a point, just
  click... to create a line point, just release the button\"... this produces corner
  points with BCPs included. Other tools (Add Corner Tool, Rectangle Tool) don't make
  this mistake.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/draw-tool2_4625.png]\r\n\r\nHere
  the \"Drawing Tool\" example has yellow BCP indicators on top of the corner nodes.
  How can this be prevented?\r\n"

    corner tool to position your extrema points and then pull your curves out of the
    hard shape. It\u2019s much more efficient. Use the Robofab line macro and you
    don\u2019t even have to waste time closing up the shapes."

  body: "@Dunwich - Interesting tip on using the Add Corner Tool exclusively, then
    pulling curves later. I looked in my bag of RoboFab scripts that come with the
    current version, but couldn't find the \"line macro\" you mentioned. I'd like
    to try it out, where does it live and what's the file name on the script? Thanks.\r\n\r\nWhile
    using FontLab's tools I always have the feeling that there must be a more intuitive
    method, or that I'm missing a preference setting, or perhaps I'm just not holding
    down the correct option-shift-command sequence.\r\n\r\nThe main concern I have
    with the Drawing Tool, as shown above, is the extra (yet zero length) handles
    that are added to every straight line corner. Also shown in the example are indicators
    for closepath (blue node) and startpoint (grey arrow). These indicators are absent
    on the contour created with the Drawing Tool. Another reason to avoid using the
    Drawing Tool?\r\n\r\nI would love to hear from anyone who wants to share their
    \"best practice\" method for drawing contours, Drawing Tool or otherwise."

  body: "The RoboFab line tool is in the dropdown menu to the left of the macro subfolders
    dropdown. It comes with others, tool, but I haven't figured them out.\r\n\r\nMy
    impression is that the drawing tool probably works better for Illustrator users
    who just want to draw shapes without being too anal about the details. Not so
    great for type designers who want to view in and worry about absolute control
    of details down to 1/1000th of an em. "
