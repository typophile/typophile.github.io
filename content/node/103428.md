  body: Typically a modification like that would be done by the font's author/licensor
    (and with their knowledge/permission). Even changing something as simple as the
    name is more complicated without the original source files, since it involves
    decompiling/recompiling the font. [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/|TTX]]
    would be one tool to use; it converts fonts to XML, so you could use a text editor
    to search for and modify the appropriate name entries (there are several), then
    recompile. (Worth mentioning that many font/software licenses prohibit modification
    or decompilation, so, you know, be kind, don't get into trouble, etc.)

  body: "Most EULAs (these days) forbid any kind of modification. If you do decide
    to violate a EULA's no-mod clause, make sure the resultant font doesn't leak out
    (which in a large company is pretty impossible though); and if it does leak out,
    be prepared to pay for that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    modifying the name would help track who has it.\r\n\r\n:tony"
