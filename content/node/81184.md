body: "Hey guys, just had a little tiff with a moody copywriter at work, talking about
  the way a \"deck\" or subheading should look. I work at an online publication and
  we have a lot of old newspaper types here, was hoping to get some opinions on this.
  \r\n\r\nHe's saying that the break in the deck from one line to two should happen
  so that they are as close as possible in width, which i agree with, except for when
  the second line would be longer than the first. Am I incorrect? Should I be breaking
  headlines and subheadlines without regard to keeping the first line longer than
  the second?\r\n"

  body: "I usually use \"deck\" to mean a short paragraph below a subhead that briefly
    introduces an article. As far as subheads go, yes, they often look best with the
    first line longer, but there may be a specific reason to break it differently:
    for meaning, to allow a narrower column, to allow a larger font, to avoid splitting
    a name, etc. So it depends on the specific instance as well s the overall style
    of the publication \u2014 the choice is a stylistic one as well as an aesthetic
    one."

  body: Your colleague would probably like to see both lines as long as possible,
    as white space was considered somewhat precious, if not downright effeminate,
    in a certain style of news design.
