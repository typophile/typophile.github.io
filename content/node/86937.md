body: "Hi,\r\nI'm designing a cultural magazine mainly focussing on music through
  gonzo-ish journalism and am considering using Nobel for copy.\r\nI'd would really
  like to get DTL Nobel for this but am afraid the Regular weight would be too dark
  and the Light, well, not enough. The tone of the magazine dictates decisiveness
  but I can't help thinking Frere-Jones' Nobel Book would be a safer one (though the
  x-height is very small and I'm not too fond of the spacing).\r\nMy main question
  then is: Would it be suicidal to go for DTL Nobel Regular and possibly Light for
  copy?"
