body: Found a couple of really close matches (Pacific Sans, Condor Comp, Engebrechtre)
  but the right leg of their letter 'R' doesn't quite match the one used here. Any
  clues...?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2hntajb_6691.jpeg]

    Grotesk]] (/R close but overall not matching), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/normandy-isle/|Normandy]]
    (same kind of /R but same problem, off)\r\nFor the rest and part of this /R (which
    could easily be redrawn starting from /P and adding its top right quarter as leg),
    that looks pretty close to (if not matching) Pacific Sans, as you suggested. \r\nYour
    chance is probably to  contact [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Alternateve-Vintage-clothing-Branding/4166399|Vanessa
    Pepin]] and ask her directly.\r\n"

    the website her portfolio links to. If I still don't get a response I'm surely
    it can be easily redrawn like you suggest.\r\n\r\nWhatFontis - this was one of
    the fonts a found to be very similar but upon very close inspection the R is still
    slightly off."
