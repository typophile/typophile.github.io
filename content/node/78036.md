body: "I am wondering, if there are still any standards on how tall you draw your
  letters within the em-square.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ems_6350.jpg]\r\n\r\nFormerly
  type foundries had their own standards on how \"big\" a typeface was drawn into
  the em, usually with a standard cap-heigt of around 700 units (within 1000 units
  for the em). The x-height, ascenders, descenders etc. were then apropriately scaled
  to meet the cap-height standard.\r\n\r\nToday it occurs to me, that type designers
  don't use any standards any more (right?). I found these arguments for that - do
  you find anything further?\r\n- with a cap-height of around 700 upm, some parts
  of the font (accents or even ascenders) will reach out of the em and will be cropped
  in some programs (on screen).\r\n- if line spacing is left to auto, it often looks
  too tight. Sometimes ascenders and descenders even touch. If the letters are drawn
  smaller into the em, the line spacing looks larger and in most cases better.\r\n-
  on the other hand, some users might get confused if a font with the same point size
  all of a sudden looks much smaller.\r\n- also some fonts with tiny details might
  have \"resolution\" problems when drawn too small (e.g. Zapfino with extremely tall
  ascenders).\r\n\r\nIn my own practice I tend to scale the letters down, so that
  all (or at least most) parts of the font are within the 1000 units of the em. Nothing
  gets cropped, line spacing looks good, but some users have to get used to apply
  bigger point sizes when they use the font.\r\nWhat are your habits?\r\nDo you decide
  from case to case or do you use your own standards?\r\nAre there other arguments
  I missed?\r\n\r\nThanks for your thoughts,\r\noliver\r\n\r\nPS: I am not interested
  in the technical aspects of the metrics as discussed here:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/77906\r\n"

  body: "Nice question.\r\n\r\nI've generally been following the first model, with
    caps at around 725 units. Uppercase accents then fit up to about 975 units, and
    descenders go down to about -225 units. However in my latest creations I'm more
    tending to scale the letters down so cap height is about 575, cap accents up to
    850 and descenders to -165, which avoids crashing as you mentioned. My opinion
    is that default line spacing should be deliberately designed into the font to
    look as polished as possible. (No crashing.)\r\n\r\nWord space is another one
    that sometimes seems not to get designed carefully."

  body: "If you just want to ask \"what do people do\" that can be done without getting
    technical. But you then bring up \"arguments\" (your word) for why people should
    do certain things.\r\n\r\nThe arguments given are based on understandings or misunderstandings
    about some of the technical aspects of metrics. So I can't discuss those arguments
    for or against different kinds of spacing without getting technical and bringing
    up some of the same things (like what programs/OSes do what line spacing determined
    how) that are in the thread that you said you didn't want to talk about.\r\n\r\n>
    - with a cap-height of around 700 upm, some parts of the font (accents or even
    ascenders) will reach out of the em and will be cropped in some programs (on screen).\r\n\r\nGoing
    beyond the em does not result in cropping in almost any programs. Both Mac OS
    and Windows use things other than the em to determine where to clip, as discussed
    in that other thread.\r\n\r\n> - if line spacing is left to auto, it often looks
    too tight. Sometimes ascenders and descenders even touch. If the letters are drawn
    smaller into the em, the line spacing looks larger and in most cases better.\r\n\r\nIn
    typical Mac and Windows applications (like office type apps), line spacing is
    determined by things in addition to the size of the letters relative to the em,
    and you can set those metrics as you wish to get more generous line spacing. In
    more sophisticated DTP apps, yes, this can be an issue, though of course those
    users are supposedly more sophisticated and could adjust the spacing.\r\n\r\nThe
    technical aspects are discussed in that \"other thread.\"\r\n\r\n> - on the other
    hand, some users might get confused if a font with the same point size all of
    a sudden looks much smaller.\r\n\r\nAgreed.\r\n\r\n> - also some fonts with tiny
    details might have \"resolution\" problems when drawn too small (e.g. Zapfino
    with extremely tall ascenders).\r\n\r\nFor this case, I don't see that a slight
    variation in size of the letters (in font units) is likely to help. Instead, change
    the resolution of the em. (e.g. 2000 font units instead of 1000).\r\n\r\nI haven't
    checked this, but I wouldn't be surprised if I learned that when Apple did their
    famous rescaling of Zapfino for OS X 10.2, they simply changed the size of the
    em while leaving everything else constant. Zapfino got smaller, but (if my supposition
    is correct) it would have done so with no loss of detail or change in the outlines.
    The max units per em (UPM) for TTFs is 16K, so that wouldn't have been a problem.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks for your help so far, especially Thomas for clarifying a few things.\r\nI
    understand, that one needs to get a bit technical to answer my question, I just
    wanted to avoid to start the same metrics discussion again...\r\nYes, I'd like
    to know if there are still some principles in use to choose the size of the letter
    drawing. And of course, I'd like to now the reasons why or why not people use
    them (sorry, the word \"argument\" was probably misleading - \"reason\" would
    be better)\r\n\r\n> Going beyond the em does not result in cropping in almost
    any programs. Both Mac OS and Windows use things other than the em to determine
    where to clip, as discussed in that other thread.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\nIn
    Excel (Mac 2008) letters of some fonts are cropped while you're typing (Helvetica
    System TT). They will be displayed right once you leave the cell, but the accents
    look like they belong to the upper line. This doesn't happen if you design the
    font completely within the 1000 upm.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/excel_5759.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
    another one in Word (Mac 2008) with Times (System TT):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/word_5157.png]\r\n\r\nI
    don't think this is marginal. I actually find it quite annoying. But maybe I'm
    wrong if I always thought that the reasen for this cropping is drawing beyond
    the em."

  body: "From the answers I got here and thru the ATypI mailing list, I'd like to
    propose this model (for latin fonts):\r\n\r\n- Draw your letters completely within
    the em, so that the bounding box of all letters lies within the em. Use global
    guides to mark your actual (visual) ascenders, x-height etc. \r\n- For your Vertical
    Metrics you can then use easy values to make line spacing consistant:\r\nmake
    all ascenders (TypoAscender, WinAscent etc.) the same value; same for all descenders;
    make all line gaps zero.\r\n- If you run into resolution problems, set the upm
    size to 2048 (or even 10000).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/em_6374.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nadvantages:\r\n-
    no clipping nowhere and no annoying accent wizardry\r\n- line spacing is consistant
    (and also looks quite good as it appears slightly bigger)\r\n- the font looks
    a bit smaller as usually, which makes the default 12pt setting in many programs
    a much better choice\r\ndrawback:\r\n- users have to get used to a smaller appearance
    of the font when they apply the point size\r\n(which I think is acceptable)\r\n\r\nIt's
    a bit like back to hot metal type. Like \"Ascender\" and \"Descender\" would be
    the edges of your lead letter and you can't go beyond.\r\nWhat do you think?\r\no."

  body: I agree with Karsten. It is not the job of a fontmaker to compensate bugs
    in OSes or applications. The interface between the fontmaker and the application/OS
    developer is the (OpenType) specification. If a font, which is conformant with
    the requirements and recommendations of the specification, behaves bad, then the
    bug is on the application side.
