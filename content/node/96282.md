  body: Don't know (or think) if Nelio design has been based on an existing (or not)
    typeface. It reminds somehow [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bickham-script-mm/|Bickham
    Script]] and some of its alternates. There's also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-champion-script-pro/|Champion
    Script]], mainly the lowercases, uppercases look too flourished.
