How is this working? This is for a wedding photographer that wants to appeal to the less traditional bride, but not alienate the more traditional bride. She selected the color.

I do have to place one comment: looking at the elements it doesn't become clear it is for a photographer. I would like to see a few reference points for that.

O, one thing. I think the centrered text should be equaly placed. It is too perfect.

thanks! I know that is my concern too...but I am not sure what to do to make it more obvious. To me it would work better for a cake decorator or an invite designer or a seamstress ...but what can I do to make it look more like a photographer that is not cheesy?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps you can explore the artistic style currently being used, with an illustrated camera.  OR perhaps more emphasis on your Name and Title.  The latter should read "Pictorialist" for an added layer of fun.  A pictorialist references the photography folks of the late 1800's and earily 1900's exploring various methodology to produce a "painterly" effect, and more over, to show the public that Photography IS an art.  Your business card has a 1800's Victorian flare to it and I would advise that further exploration of that period will give you a unique look and feel your looking for.

		<div class="commentbody">I personally would not worry about the photography or camera aspect of the card. As you said, this is about <em>wedding</em> photography, so lenses and shutters are too literal.

		<div class="commentbody">My suggestions:
1. Make the secondary matter as large as possible (within the contsraints of the design) and the word PHOTOGRAPHER even more, so that it stands out.
2. How about losing one of the lines by combining the e-mail with the url, like (info@)loribaetcetera?

		<div class="commentbody">This is a total design reversal, but if I recall my youth, Victorian pictures were often presented in oval frames that contained ornate bric-a-brac designs in the corner. So moving the decoration outside of the oval, and putting the information inside, where the photo (we called them tin-types back then) went might create an impression that is more photographic.

Just an idea.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi there,

The first one that you had took on this playful, victorian meets cute style, and I liked it.  I think that the brown is a much darker value - I'm sure if you desaturate this thing, you'll see that the brown is a lot darker, and for some reason, it feels like too much contrast - like it's competing with the rest of the layout.  

I liked the victorian elements to the first mock up, and think you should push it further in that direction. A lot of cool stuff came out of that time period.

ALSO, this all depends on what kind of photographer this person is - let their style determine your concept!  If they shoot kids a lot, then I think you're headed in a good direction.  

Good luck!
