  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Although I normally steer clear of the bland, overused fonts, there are rare times when I have to use them. Now is one of those times.</p>
<p>I am digitizing the archives of a programming-language-standards group. Their meetings were run according to Robert&rsquo;s Rules of Order and their documents were meticulously formatted and tracked with version numbers, so this project has to rigorously respect the history.</p>
<p>That means I&rsquo;m stuck with Times New Roman or a near clone for many of these documents. It doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m stuck with bad typography necessarily, though. I can make non-substantive typographic changes, like shifting acronyms into small caps, introducing old style figures when they&rsquo;re used in the text rather than headers or tables, and so on.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my question, which I&rsquo;ve explored before unsuccessfully:</p>
<p>What is the most typographically complete version of Times on the market?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for text figures, italic text figures, small caps, and italic small caps at least (we deal with a lot of acronyms, some in book or document titles).</p>
<p>The restriction is that I can&rsquo;t use compatible but recognizably different typefaces. The glyphs have to recognizably be Times.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On Nick&rsquo;s recommendation I picked up Starling and am impressed. It is a surreal experience to be able to set text properly in what is essentially Times New Roman with text figures, small caps, sloped small caps, and ligatures. Being able to tame all the figures and acronyms - some of which are in book titles and so require italics - restores the spotty, shouty mess Times New Roman makes of our technical documents to some semblance of a calm woven texture. What a relief! Starling has solved my typographic problem.</p>
<p>Four observation on Starling from my casual study of it:</p>
<p>First, Starling has another advantage over Times New Roman, though I didn&rsquo;t make use of it in this project; Times New Roman only comes in two weights, but Starling offers six, which gives the typographer much greater control over the text&rsquo;s color on the page.</p>
<p>Second, on the flip side, Times New Roman has a much more extensive collection of glyphs, including extended Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, and Cyrillic. One does expect a ubiquitous face like TNR to support more languages than most. I didn&rsquo;t need those characters for this project, but others will.</p>
<p>I considered whether the two weights of Times New Roman might be used to fill in those gaps in Starling. TNR regular weight may or may not match Starling book weight closely enough to blend in, and I couldn&rsquo;t tell in my skim whether bold TNR is close enough to heavy Starling to match. Even if these weights are close enough, the lack of small caps in TNR means this approach to supplementing Starling would leave the extended Latin set incomplete, since there would be no extended Latin small caps to match TNR&rsquo;s extended Latin upper case. Further, the other four weights of Starling would then be left without equivalent characters.</p>
<p>While eyeballing the weight in Font Book I noticed that the axis of TNR&rsquo;s O and Q don&rsquo;t match Starling; TNR rationalized their axis, even though the lower-case letters (most visibly the o) retain a humanist axis that doesn&rsquo;t match. There may be other differences as well, but that&rsquo;s enough reason alone not to try to use TNR to extend Starling when additional characters are needed.</p>
<p>So, for projects requiring those additional characters, the ideal solution would be to add them to Starling, which would be a significant undertaking.</p>
<p>Third, neither Starling nor TNR has superscript and subscript figures, which is surprising considering TNR&rsquo;s widespread use for academic and scientific manuscripts. Calculating them as most word-processors do produces results as satisfactory as calculating small caps - that is, better than nothing but by no means good.</p>
<p>Although both faces include half and quarters as preformed fractions, TNR also includes thirds and eighths. Most word-processors can&rsquo;t calculate these at all, so their inclusion avoids a choice between using typographically awkward manual fractions or modifying the fonts to add them (assuming numerator and denominator figures are included to make that a trivial edit). Neither Starling nor TNR includes numerator figures 5 through 0 (1 through 4 are included in Starling, 1 through 3 in TNR), or any denominator figures, making repairing the fonts difficult.</p>
<p>In technical work, superscripts, subscripts, and fractions come up a lot, even though most fonts provide little support for them. Adding these forty-two characters to each of Starling&rsquo;s twenty-four fonts would give it another edge over TNR.</p>
<p>Fourth, a helpful but relatively easy change for the font designer to make is adding tabular (monospaced) figures (both lining and text). This makes the face better suited to financial use, since financial text tables become easier to compose. Neither Starling nor TNR includes them yet, despite TNR&rsquo;s widespread use in offices.</p>
<p>Overall, I was surprised by how much typographical support is missing from Times New Roman. Although I knew about its basic typographical deficiencies (the modernist exclusion of text figures and small caps), I still expected it to have a greater advantage over Starling in these other areas, given TNR&rsquo;s huge office-user base and its much longer history of active development. Instead, with a little work Starling&rsquo;s developers could easily extend it to exceed TNR&rsquo;s numerical support, though meeting or exceeding TNR&rsquo;s linguistic support will take more work.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even without these features, just being able to set most Western European text properly makes Starling a huge improvement over Times New Roman.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I noticed on the Font Bureau page describing Starling that William Burgess Starling designed it in 1904. As that was before Times Roman even existed, I was a bit puzzled; how could it be a modified version of Times Roman.</p>
<p>So I searched, and found this on the web:</p>
<p><a href="http://chutzpah.typepad.com/slow_movement/design/page/2/">http://chutzpah.typepad.com/slow_movement/design/page/2/</a></p>
<p>which seems to go into quite a bit of detail on the story.</p>

<p>Times Roman does strongly resemble Plantin. The Monotype revival of Plantin, however, dates from 1913, which is also after 1904. Even if Stanley Morison was a &ldquo;character&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s no reason to suspect the origin of the Plantin revival.</p>
<p>This may not be an issue, since Burgess could have used the original Plantin typeface as a source of inspiration, of course.</p>
