  body: Can't find a match but... They use [[https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/karbon|Karbon]]
    for their [[http://www.kesko.fi/Documents/19366-Kesko_Corporate_Responsibility_Report_2012.pdf|corporate
    identity]] and it looks to fit almost perfectly all logo letters except /S. So
    may be they started with Karbon and tweaked /S.
