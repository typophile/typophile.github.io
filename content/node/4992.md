body: I bought an HP business inkjet 1100 which works fine but prints incomplete text
  &#40;missing characters, even missing lines&#41; when using the Adobe Type Mannager
  Deluxe to load postscript fonts, when this program is off text prints ok, but when
  it

  body: I was confused, true type fonts do print well while ATM is on,the problem
    being postscript fonts. Should I upgrade the operting system? or consider converting
    my postscript fonts to true type? Do converted fonts work well?

  body: 'I converted a couple of postscript fonts to true type format, they worked
    but had a couple of bugs: <BR> <BR>1&#41; They had a bunch of innecesary extra
    vector points in the outlines, specially on curves <BR> <BR>2&#41; They rendered
    awfully on screen <BR> <BR>Is there a way to avoid this?'

  body: Doing a clean format conversion is not trivial - Fontographer for example
    is pretty hopeless. But FontLab is supposed to be really good, and there are some
    small stand-alone utilities for doing that which also have good reps. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I fooled around a bit and assume that the vector points apparition is implicit
    in the switch between cuadratic and cubic curves.  <BR> <BR>What about screen
    rendering ? <BR>

  body: 'TT curves need more on-curve points, but fewer BCPs, than PS. But some conversion
    algorithms &#40;like Fog&#39;s&#41; brute-force it and put way too many points
    - and sometimes ruin things too. Try this for example: take an &#34;s&#34; that
    has no explicit inflection points in its spine &#40;so just a point at each end
    of each spine curve - nothing in the middle&#41; and convert it to TT... <BR>
    <BR>Screen rendering: <BR>Actually, unless the hinting is totally ruined &#40;something
    Fog would probably do though...&#41; the TT renderer will generally do a better
    job than the PS renderer! But if not what you can do is turn on anti-aliasing
    for all PPEM sizes. You can use FontLab or VTT to do this. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Actually, TT curves need more total points, period, for reasonably equivalent
    curves in all but a few simple cases. However, it&#39;s certainly true that most
    conversion approaches tend to use more points than one might think necessary in
    an attempt to get a closer match to the original. This occurs because you can&#39;t
    make a perfect match to cubic curves with quadratic curves &#40;though you can
    going the other direction&#41;. <BR> <BR>Contrary to what Hrant suggests, it is
    my experience that auto-hinted TrueType generally does not render as well as auto-hinted
    Type 1. You can of course do a lot more with manual TrueType hinting, but when
    we&#39;re talking simple conversions without manual work, yes, the rendering generally
    suffers. Even if you do it in FontLab. Turning on anti-aliasing for all sizes
    will help, though. <BR> <BR>T

  body: I guess any conversion entails a loss of efficiency&#42;, which accounts for
    both the increase in points and the decrease in hinting quality. But doesn&#39;t
    the same thing happen the other way? Take a good TT font, convert it to PS, and
    you&#39;ll end up with more points and worse rendering. So I suspect it depends
    on the quality of the conversion most of all. <BR> <BR>&#42; Are you sure PS to
    TT is lossless? <BR> <BR>As for on-screen rendering quality, it&#39;s pretty clear
    to me that the TT algorithms are much better - it&#39;s just that it&#39;s harder
    to take proper advantage of them. Like stickshift versus automatic transmission.
    Certainly in Windows, PS rendering is the pits - and on the Mac you had bitmaps
    to help out - although no longer, since they&#39;ve now adopted the full-fuzz
    delusions. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'No, this isn&#39;t a matter of &#34;loss of efficiency.&#34; Given a constant
    em square, the cubics used by PostScript are a higher order math than the quadratics
    used by TrueType. They are a superset. You can go the one way losslessly, and
    not the other. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m taking it from this discussion that you have never
    read my article on font formats. It&#39;s available in various locations, including
    here: <BR><a href="http://www.font.to/downloads/TT_PS_OT.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.font.to/downloads/TT_PS_OT.pdf</a>
    <BR> <BR>There&#39;s no question that &#42;if&#42; one puts manual hinting work
    in, TrueType will look better than Type 1 in Windows in apps that use the OS rendering.
    It also helps if the developer manually fixes up the outlines, if they were converted
    from Type 1. However, we&#39;re talking about automated conversions. In such cases,
    they generally look the same as or worse than the original. <BR> <BR>So, yes,
    the TrueType format has a bazillion capabilities that Type 1 lacks. But hardly
    any of these get used particularly well in simply converted fonts that have not
    had any manual work. Even with pretty good converters, it has always been my observation
    that Type 1 fonts converted to TrueType render about equally well at best, and
    generally look worse. <BR> <BR>When you&#39;re talking Apple&#39;s current OS
    X rendering, it&#39;s not at all clear to me that there is any reason that even
    superhinted TrueType should fare any better than auto-hinted Type 1. <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>T <BR>'

  body: Back on the Type 1 to TrueType angle again, I should add that my comments
    about TT autohinter quality are solely for the readily available retail-priced
    solutions. Various companies have proprietary or high-end TT autohinters that
    may do a significantly better job. Ditto the outline conversion. <BR> <BR>Now,
    going from TrueType to Type 1, the outlines aren&#39;t harmed any, and the readily
    available auto-hinters are pretty good &#40;and likely to improve more soon&#41;.
    But mostly it depends on how well hinted the TrueType was, and the particular
    imaging environment. Getting worse and getting better are both pretty plausible
    outcomes, as is &#34;different but equal.&#34; <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T
