  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>To date, the Ridley and <a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/may/25/us-box-office-robin-hood-kites>Russell</a> reunion tour has coaxed a mere $66.1m (?46m) from audiences across the pond. That&rsquo;s small change for a tentpole release these days – especially one that reportedly cost $200m – and Robin Hood will do well to creep past $100m before the theatrical cycle comes to a close. But studio heads know that even when a movie disappoints in the domestic market, they can, if the circumstances are right, rely on the international arena to prop it up.</p>
<p>That usually means having a universal, well-executed story with recognisable cast. Comedies, for example, are notoriously poor travellers because of cultural differences. The way the studios see it, everybody responds to a gun and a girl, but not everybody will get a gag. So something like MacGruber (see chart below), the US comedy that opened poorly over the weekend and is based on a sketch known only to Saturday Night Live aficionados, would appear to be dead in the water.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve got an action movie directed by Ridley Scott that boasts a firmament of international stars like Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, veteran William Hurt and the darkly charismatic Mark Strong, you&rsquo;ll fancy your chances overseas. Universal&rsquo;s international distribution machine has drummed up $125m for Robin Hood so far, and that&rsquo;s in line with the received wisdom that a major studio release tends to gross two-thirds of its worldwide total outside North America.</p>
<p>But even a slickly produced movie with a name cast needs a leg-up, and any marketing maven will tell you that in the pantheon of leg-ups they don&rsquo;t rank any higher than the Cannes international film festival. Previous Hollywood releases like The Da Vinci Code and Shrek 2 have benefited from a promotional push on the Cote d&rsquo;Azur, and Robin Hood is no different.</p>
<p>The studio saved money on a global publicity tour because it got the world&rsquo;s press in one place and created a nice buzz in the opening weekend. The follow-up weekend was solid, and the movie&rsquo;s international gross will end up sparing Universal&rsquo;s blushes. After a relatively soft opening weekend in North America for Shrek Forever After, the DreamWorks Animation-Paramount people might be wishing they&rsquo;d secured an opening night berth on the Croisette, too. Then again, that movie&rsquo;s initial international foray over the weekend delivered excellent results.</p>
<p>Kites is a Bollywood movie that sneaked into the top 10 this weekend. It was released through Reliance Big Pictures, a division of the influential Indian telecoms, finance and entertainment conglomerate Reliance ADA Group that partially bankrolled Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s new-look DreamWorks and has been running around Hollywood signing production deals with a host of talent from Brad Pitt to Julia Roberts to Brett Ratner.</p>
