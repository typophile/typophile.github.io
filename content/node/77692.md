body: "After a painstaking search to identify just the right handwriting font, I found
  this one, pasted a screenshot into an e-mail and sent it to a colleague for feedback.
  What I *didn't* do was note the name of the font, or bookmark the site. Now, of
  course, I want to license it and can't remember the name/vendor/foundry.\r\n\r\nIt's
  an OpenType font with lots of alternate characters to create a more realistic simulation
  of handwriting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/script_5658.jpg]"

    is a FontShop exclusive.
