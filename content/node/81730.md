  body: I don't normally comment on these threads, but I think you have some serious
    proportional issues that need working out. Your b,d,p,q don't relate well, your
    u looks like a y (it is a y) and they are both too narrow, and your caps are a
    mess. That M is going to kill you, and the J is going to catch itself on the ledge
    and break its neck. It would behoove you to show the caps and the lowercase at
    the same size. Sizing them to fit on one line does no one any good.

    you have done, but the whole thing still looks sloppy.\r\n\r\nFrom a proportional
    standpoint, look how much white space is present in the h, n, m, u, and then contrast
    that with the round forms (b,d,q,p,o,c,e). Either the round forms are too narrow
    or those others are too wide. The very vertical characterization of the p, b,
    d, q, seems at odds with the rounder o, e, c. The v and y look drunk in comparison
    those the other glyphs.The middle of the w is too wide compared to the right and
    left side. The f and t look to narrow, and the foot on the l does not need to
    be there. The bottom bowl on the g is too narrow and a bit square. the bottom
    diagonal of the k needs to move more to the left. The x is terrible, and overall
    the spacing is really, really bad.\r\n\r\nI tell my students that a properly spaced
    and poorly drawn font is much more useful than a beautifully drawn poorly spaced
    one. If you concentrate on spacing this sucker, it will give you more insight
    into how to draw it.\r\n\r\nGood luck."

    like a plan that makes a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nHm, not sure about that new \"W\".
    It gets much more complex and dense than the other letters so it might just stick
    out too much (and clog \u2013 you'll probably hate making the Bold). Personally
    I'd probably stick with the one you had before but (1) make it a little narrower
    and (2) you might try lowering the apex \u2013 maybe it doesn't have to reach
    all the way up to the cap line. That way it can also get a little less wide."

    be necessary to change anything. And yes, your hooks look too light.

    to placement. From what I have researched, the horn on the /u/ can be either moved
    down or sticking out of the top (usually it is based on whether the face is serif
    or not).\r\n\r\nMost every example I've found has the horn on the /O's/ and the
    /U's/ reaching a different height. \r\n\r\nI assume you're more correct than myself

    horns at different heights. I'd be interested to know what Vietnamese people make

    over the letters in Vietnamese it would be best to keep the horns in one alignment."
