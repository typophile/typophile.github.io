body: "Should the font have kerning pairs for all the possibilities, or is it acceptable
  to skip pairs that will never exist in words?\r\n\r\nIn designing the kerning pairs
  for the Armenian font I came across some pairs (like co-yi or tso-hi) that will
  never occur in a real word (not even in foreign words), but the pair is drawn in
  such a way that they will partly overlap if typed by mistake.\r\n\r\nShould I create
  a kerning for such pairs?"

  body: "The paradox is that it can take longer to think about and analyse it than
    to actually do it! :-)  In Armenian especially the non-alphabetic characters aren't
    many; although the alphabetic ones (not to mention the floating marks) require
    much heavier kerning than in the Latin alphabetics.\r\n\r\nMore than kerning though
    the real problem in Armenian is the detminental effect the requirement of tight
    spacing can have on the actual forms of the glyphs, especially descenders.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "That is one of the main issues I am facing. I decided I will do all the features
    for this first OTF project and save a reference for future fonts.\r\n\r\nAs I
    understand you Hrant, if it is faster to skip it is OK? I am still analysing the
    kerning and positioning of the marks, which will be a lot of work. Even there,
    the marks go over a few of the glyphs only, so I will do the features for only
    those pairs.\r\n\r\nTight spacing is a big issue in Armenian. Most of the fonts
    available today are not designed in a very good way. They either lack the needed
    spacing/kerning, or the glyph is designed in within its own bounds and requires
    minimal or no kerning, which of course is bad font design."

  body: "I was actually saying that sometimes simply deciding what to skip can take
    longer than not skipping. I think generally a good compromise strategy is to make
    some intelligent macro decisions about kerning (for example \"I will kern the
    alphabetics with anything/everything\" or \"I will not kern between consonants
    and floating marks\") and just do all the rest blindly. It's only when the deadline*
    is too tight for the kerning job at hand that you have get more clever (or lower
    your standards :-) for example by using linguistic frequencies, grammatical realities,
    etc.\r\n\r\n* If there is one; for labors of love (like Armenian type design usually
    is) often there is no deadline... The problem is you then have to define some
    other \"barrier\" in order not to still be working on the damn thing on your deathbed!
    \ :-)\r\n\r\n> Most of the fonts available today are not designed in a very good
    way.\r\n\r\nThat's the understatement of the \"tar\"...  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
