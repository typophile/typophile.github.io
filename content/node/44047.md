body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nI'm kind of stumped on a technical issue here, and was
  wodering if anybody could help.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to wrap up my first font, and
  it has some alternates, like so:\r\n\r\nfeature calt {\r\n\tsub [fshort lshort]
  l' [b f h k l] by l;\r\n\tsub [fshort lshort] f' [b f h k l] by f;\r\n\t\r\n\tsub
  l' [b f h k l] by lshort;\r\n\tsub f' [b f h k l] by fshort;\r\n\t\r\n} calt;\t\t\r\n\r\nIt
  also has some oldstyle numerals:\r\n\r\nfeature onum {\r\n  sub zero by zero.onum;\r\n
  \ sub one by one.onum;\r\n  sub two by two.onum;\r\n  sub three by three.onum;\r\n
  \ sub four by four.onum;\r\n  sub five by five.onum;\r\n  sub six by six.onum;\r\n
  \ sub seven by seven.onum;\r\n  sub eight by eight.onum;\r\n  sub nine by nine.onum;\r\n}
  onum;\r\n\r\nWhen I test my font in Illustrator CS3 at home, it works file; I can
  use the OpenType panel to use my alternates, and when I select Proportional Oldstyle
  I get my oldstyle numerals.\r\n\r\nBut, in Illustrator CS at work, the alternates
  button is disabled and selecting different figure options doesn't do anything.\r\n\r\nI'm
  using FontLab Studio 5.0.2 for Windows, if that's important.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"

    'calt' code - looks like you're substituting a glyph with itself for both l and
    f. Whassup with that?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Hi Tom,\r\n\r\nI don't entirely understand that myself.\r\n\r\nIf you hop
    on over to http://pics.livejournal.com/oogby/pic/0000x4bw/ , you'll see what the
    alternates do: they shorten f's and l's when they're followed by a lowercase letter
    with an ascender.\r\n\r\nOn the word 'wallflower', the 'llfl' bit goes short-normal-short-normal,
    which I think is pretty spiffy. Without those first two lines, it's short-short-short-normal
    in FontLab, which looked kind of funny to me. \r\n\r\nThough... I just tested
    that in Illustrator CS3, and it's doing the short-short-short-normal thing. I'll
    have to fix that..."

  body: "It's a bit picky & doesn't address you problem, but your alternate glyphs
    should be .short -- as in l.short and f.short.\r\n\r\nAs to the behavior of CS
    opposed to CS3, Does CS support OpenType?"

  body: "AFAIK, Illustrator CS and CS3 have essentially the same OpenType support.
    Mind you, there will have been some bugs fixed in there somewhere.\r\n\r\nI understand
    the net effect of the code, but the first two lines of substitutions take l and
    f and replace them with themselves. In any case, the latter two lines are completely
    adequate to achieve the desired effect if you just want the letter styles to alternate.
    If you wanted to get the shortened form to repeat, then you would need to chain
    the letters or write the code differently.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    I should really get the latest patch and see if that changes things.\r\n\r\nI'll
    have to remove those lines tonight and see if if behaves differently in Illustrator
    than it does in FontLab."

  body: "To continue on the tangent...\r\n\r\nI tried removing the odd calt lines,
    and it's not alternating in Illustrator (or Fontlab anymore). Bummer. I should
    probably read more about how this stuff works.\r\n\r\nBut, I finally requested
    the 5.0.4 patch, so maybe that will make FontLab and Illustrator behave consistently,
    at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    like this, after having discovered the existence of 'ignore' statements:\r\n\r\nfeature
    calt {\r\n\tignore substitute [l.short f.short] l' [b f h k l];\r\n\r\n\tsubstitute
    l' [b f h k l] by l.short;\r\n\tsubstitute f' [b f h k l] by f.short;\t\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\nStill
    no lock with Illustrator CS though."
