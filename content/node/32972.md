  for tech support, all to no avail. So here goes!\r\n\r\nI was recently playing around
  with a new font and testing it in InDesign. Well, the client decided to add another
  version of the font so I decided to rename the font. I unloaded the font from ATM
  (Windows), regenerated it with the new name, reloaded it and opened InDesign. Well,
  InDesign was still displaying the OLD FONT NAME!! It wasn't until I RENAMED the
  font FILE that InDesign showed the correct font name.\r\n\r\nAfter some searching
  I found various \"AdobeFnt##.lst\" where the \"##\" is a 2 digit number, and deleted
  them, but it STILL seems to equate a font name with a particular font FILE.\r\n\r\nSo,
  two questions then: One, am I loosing my mind or has anyone else seen this? And
  two, if I'm NOT loosing my mind, why in the name of all that is good about working
  with modern type would Adobe keep such a list instead of just always reading the
  @#!$%! GUI?!?!?!?!\r\n\r\nSorry, I'm done ranting now. Any info would be greatly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nKen\r\n"
