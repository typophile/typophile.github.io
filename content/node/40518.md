  body: "Depending on your point of view about this, there are an <em>awful</em> lot
    of very similar fonts to be found in the 'Techno' category at Dafont.com. I am
    no longer surprised at how often I find the answers to Techno font ID questions
    by setting the sample to the mystery font letters and then scrolling the selections
    looking for a match.\r\n\r\nIn the commercial world Identikal, Psy/Ops, and T-26
    are some of the places I look first for 'Techno'. Ray Larabie's work bridges both
    worlds, as he has made many free fonts of this style, with polished up commercial
    versions.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
