  from a town called Rochdale in England. I'm a fully trained Graphic Designer and
  my work consists mainly of font design and typography. I'm here to learn and give

    the conversation is as you guessed about Graphic Design, for the most part. It
    will be nice to mix with people who do the same work as me and share the same
    interest - type.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\nPS - Linda, Rochdale should UNDER
    NO CIRCUMSTANCE be immortaized."

    So many choices, so little time...\r\n\r\nPresumably you're not up for any <a

    jokes either? I can't remember what it sounded like, but it's a fun picture."
