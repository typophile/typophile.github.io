    Web Fonts']] [[http://www.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Josefin+Sans&subset=latin#variants|Josefin
    Sans]]. \"Geometric, elegant and kind of vintage, special for titling. It is based
    on 1927 Rudolf Koch's Kabel, 1930 Rudolf Wolf's Memphis, 1927(?) Paul Renner's
    Futura.\" as described by it's creator, Santiago Orozco.\r\n\r\nYou should also
    check [[http://typekit.com/|Typekit]], their pricing is very reasonable and in
    case if your client doesn't want to pay there is a free plan available, of course
    with some limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSB "

  body: altsan, as a freelance Web designer & developer of over ten years, I've always
    provided my clients with the best solution for their needs. That includes free
    alternatives to my paid services. I consider it the only honest thing to do, as
    my clients come to me for my expertise. While it might cost me the occasional
    job, it earns me long-term clients and steady business. So yes, I would agree
    that it is better to earn our pay by showing why it is better. That said, sometimes
    the free option *is* better, and I'm never going to mislead a client just because
    I want to earn a buck.

  body: "Alex, those are very good questions.\r\n\r\nI don't recommend tricking people*,
    and I don't blindly advocate something simply because it benefits a certain group
    of people. I try to consider things case-by-case. In this case, when I read \"My
    client insists on Futura\" but a free alternative is sought, there's clearly a
    lack of proper valuation of type. Either the client should pay for the font they
    so badly want (which is actually the norm) or the designer has to absorb the cost.
    What seems to be happening instead is the designer hoping to con the client so
    nobody has to pay for the real thing. But yes, we do constantly have to demonstrate
    why quality costs money**. That comes with the territory.\r\n\r\n* When a regular
    Joe asks me how to simply type in Armenian on their computer, I don't try to sell
    them a font; I point them to Arasan (warning them that it's not Unicode) or this:

  body: "@hrant, Thanks for pointing out nuances I hadn't quite picked up.  \r\n\r\nTo
    clarify where my mentality comes from, one of my long-standing pet peeves is people
    who thoughtlessly use the default fonts (mostly Times and Arial) for everything
    without even thinking.  I don't deal with graphic designers or marketers, but
    rather with everyday professionals who need to knock together a document or presentation.
    \ I try to encourage and educate people like that to make more intelligent & professional-looking
    use of fonts.  So in a way, I'm actually in the habit of seeing it in peoples'
    best interests to tell them where they can find legitimate, quality fonts when
    there's no budget for purchases.  Libertine and various other open source fonts
    are common recommendations of mine.  (I'm currently rewriting a product user manual;
    one of my very first alterations was to change it from all Times New Roman to
    Libertine and Utopia, which are certainly more readable at the size they're using.)\r\n\r\nI
    must say that coming to Typophile has exposed me to some interesting alternate
    perspectives."

    \"ice-breaker\". The hope being -at least for me- that once you've nicely implanted
    a sensitivity that takes them beyond their default choices, some of them will
    go on to valuate type design, or at least the resultant fonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
