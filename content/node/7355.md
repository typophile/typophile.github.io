  body: The link system is highly unintuitive and annoying, even with the note. I
    can&#39;t see it would add anything positive. <BR> <BR>The title says &#34;Untitled
    Document&#34;, which you might want to change to something more meaningful. <BR>
    <BR>The images under &#34;ex. type&#34; and &#34;more&#34; are very nice, and
    you might consider using them &#40;randomly selected&#41; when the home page loads.
