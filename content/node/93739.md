  on them! I am also thinking about putting these into print and start selling them
  to a niche market on the internet. So, I need to know if what I'm designing is complete
  crap that won't sell. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. There are four
  of them live right now. <a href=\"http://bryanthomas.me/wallpaper/\">Check them
  out here!</a>\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    to see patriotism getting some design attention. Anyways, I would double check
    your kerning throughout the wallpapers, especially in the words \"Tyranny\" and
    \"Conservative\". \r\n\r\nCheers"
