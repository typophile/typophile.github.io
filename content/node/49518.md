body: "Hi There\r\n\r\nI'm working on a redesign for a small local Dutch newspaper
  with a printrun of around 25.000 copies. Here some digital sketches.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/regiokrant_5234.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  local newspaper attends an area where there is little to none interest from the
  mayor newspapers being spread around here.\r\nThe area this newspaper services is
  close to and within a city (Groningen) where there are quit a few newspapers. However,
  all of these are focussing on the city itself.\r\n\r\nThe \"Regiokrant\" connects
  a few villages around Groningen with a few districts of Groningen City. All \u2013
  geographically \u2013 are neighbours. This paper brings them closer together. \r\n\r\nBeside
  this it brings quality. Readers tell them that unlike those other papers, this one
  they like to read because of the stories. With them the glass is half-full instead
  of half-empty. This positive approach is appreciated.\r\n\r\nI have tried to reflect
  this in the logo. \r\nPeople interact with people. \r\nIn the balloons (the outer
  shape of the 'O') you find two men. Not in number 3.\r\n\r\nBy the way: Don't mind
  the colorscheme. I'm still working on that.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of giving them an
  emotion, but am still pondering which emotion would be best. (Happy, curious, interested
  ...).\r\nBut I want to do this with as little elements as possible. \r\n\r\nOke.
  Here my question: Does image number 1 read as \"regiokrant\"?\r\n\r\nAnd second:
  any other comments?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the following link before pressing on with a speech bubble solution:\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.eachday.com/2007/8/1/bubble-logo-insanity\r\n"

  body: "I didn't read the speech bubbles as containing faces even after you told
    me. Eventually I saw it but it looked like you just threw a { in a speech bubble
    for a while.\r\n\r\nI agree, 1 is awkward."

    gradient will not reproduce well on newsprint.\r\n\r\nRoss"

  body: "The concern posted about the gradient has validity. Quite frankly, the gradient
    likely isn't necessary. However, I disagree with overall concerns expressed with
    regards to difficulty identifying the speech bubbles and faces, both were immediately
    clear to me.\r\n\r\nI would experiment some more with different options on how
    to incorporate the speech bubble(s)/face idea. Perhaps you will come up with another
    version you like better. That said, I think you are on to a very nice logo.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\nMichael

  body: 'Its looks like a web 2.0 logo. Is it a web based newspaper? I didn''t understand
    the speech bubbles/people - all you show is a hair line. If its suppossed to represent
    a community i don''t understand what somebody''s blank face and detailed hair
    cut has to do with anything. But as someone else said - the whole speech bubble
    thing is flawed from the outset. '
