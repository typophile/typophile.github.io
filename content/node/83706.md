body: "I was hoping for some thoughts on writing urls with inital caps. I have friend
  that believes that urls that contain two words should be displayed (example only)
  like so: SuperGreat.com. He sent me to a couple of sites that say that's the most
  readable for users. However I rarely if ever see it, and it feels kind of outdated.
  I feel like it kind of makes sense in body copy but using it for display doesn't
  click for me.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Unless, of course, you have a bet on it. Matters of taste cannot be argued...or
    so said Thomas Aquinas.

  body: There is a real problem with some URLs when there is no way to parse the words.  To
    get someone to type in a string of characters from memory is actually very hard
    unless they understand the words that it spells.  Initial caps is an excellent
    strategy to overcome this problem.  There are other ways, such as color or boldness.  In
    the end it is not a matter of right or wrong, but a matter of achieving a goal
    such as getting people to actually visit your website.

  body: 'Note that the base domain name (supergreat.com) is not case sensitive, but
    the path (anything after the slash: supergreat.com/greatstuff) is, so incorrect
    capitalization will make the path invalid.'

  body: "Thanks guys. Joshua, I wasn't worried so much about the path, where case
    is very important. I was just asking about the \"designed\" display appearance
    of using SuperGreat.com as opposed to supergreat.com.  \r\nI just don't see initial
    capped urls used hardly anywhere in relation to visual design. It could be I'm
    looking at too many \"design\" things.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the comments!"
