    regulatory difficulties that cost them money. They are very likely to come looking

  body: I suppose that this sign, then, needs to be treated as a <em>logotype</em>,
    similarly to other things that appear on packaging, such as the symbols for RoHS
    compliance, CSA and UL approval, FCC authorization, and so on. Which makes me
    wonder if it even belongs in any normal fon, as opposed to a special font of useful
    logotypes - but it was assigned a Unicode point, which, of course, leads me to
    fear that some types would include variant forms due to simple ignorance rather
    than rebellion.

  body: Yes, it is something like a logotype. The only variation I make when including
    it in fonts is to scale the outline so that it corresponds to the height of the
    lining numerals, since it will almost always be used in concert with them. I don't
    think it is something that needs to be in every font, and the reason it has become
    relatively common is that it was included in the WGL4 set, which was adopted as
    a basis for a lot of pan-European OT fonts.
