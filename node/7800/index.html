I don't even know what a pattern is, but I have this mental image of someone at a yard sale buying something whose worth and use they could never fathom. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I mean, sure, some of the matrices are in a museum somewhere, but just imagine the lucky bastard who buys the patterns at some estate auction. Will he save them? Or will he throw them away? Will he even know what they are?</div>

Patterns were generally made of brass as far as I know; expensive raw material&hellip; On the other hand, if some guy can end up with a lost Elvis recording in a suitcase bought at a garage sale, then hey, who knows what typographic treasures are wallowing next to the washer-dryers of suburbia!  :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Many gems have been lost this way, but often it's not easy to blame anybody - you can't see what the future holds after all. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>
