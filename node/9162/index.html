  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">OK - my big New Year resolution to myself was to design my first type face in 2005. <BR> <BR>I have been giving this a great deal of thought and would like a little advice from the pros. <BR> <BR>My basic question being, what is the best type of face to start with? Display? Text? Serif or sans serif? <BR> <BR>I ask because unlike the great American novelist, I am not bursting with a type face that burns in my soul, demanding to be put to paper. I do not have any great philosophy that I desire to translate into a face. <BR> <BR>I am just a type geek who wants to learn about the process of creating a face. I am viewing the project as simply a learning experience. <BR> <BR>My nature is to tackle more than I can handle. I do it all the time in life. You know, design the next great face and all that. But, the truth is I could not do it out of the starting gate if I wanted to. I just need to learn to walk before I can even think about running. <BR> <BR>So, what say you? Any suggestions for a guy who wants to work on a face as a recreational and learning endeavor?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is a question I was asking myself, as I&#39;m doing the same thing &#40;have a copy of &#34;Learn Fontlab Fast&#34; in the mail, will probably buy Fontlab shortly thereafter, etc&#41;. I think the smartest thing to do is realize that, as with most creative pursuits, your first effort will most likely be a throwaway, and do whatever seems most interesting to you. In my case, that means a blackletter face, with some novel features &#40;I hope&#41;. <BR> <BR>I guess it also depends on what you&#39;re most interested in learning. How to make a &#34;useful&#34; typeface? Something flashier? How to master the tools for type creation? A yen to play around with OpenType&#39;s more gratuitous features? A desire to play with ideas of readability and legibility? A need to revive some neglected old style of type? Figuring that out should answer a lot of questions. <BR> <BR>I personally feel like starting with a serif body font would be the hardest thing imaginable; there are so many already and there&#39;s a lot of work involved in getting one to look good. And I&#39;m still wrapping my head around the subtleties of the 10,000 available modernist sans; there&#39;s no way I feel qualified to start with one of those. By contrast, I have a lot of opinions about blackletter type and it&#39;s not a field that&#39;s exactly bursting with activity at the moment, which gives me some freedom. <BR> <BR>Also, this site has a ton of useful advice for beginners: <BR> <BR><a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/" target="_blank">http://briem.ismennt.is/</a> <BR> <BR>His advice on workflow is particularly helpful.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&#62;do whatever seems most interesting to you. In my case, that means a blackletter face, with some novel features &#40;I hope&#41;. </i> <BR> <BR>Hey Forrest, that was exactly what I thought when I started designing type a year and a half ago, too. You can see my results at <a href="http://www.typeoff.com" target="_blank">http://www.typeoff.com</a> &#40;look at the &#34;Ignaz&#34; fonts&#41;. Good luck! <BR> <BR>&#60;pep_talk&#62;Mike, I&#39;m a big theory-nerd myself, but when it come do designing, I like to sit down and just do it &#40;and keep doing, and so on&#41;. Your hands and your eyes will surprise you. After you&#39;ve gotten some results, you can step back from it and begin examining things, and getting advice from others. But in the beginning</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; advice from the pros. <BR> <BR>Pros? Where?!  :-/ <BR> <BR>If you don&#39;t have a &#34;Big Idea&#34; to work from, I&#39;d say you need some severe design constraints. Like take a shot at making a font for pharmaceutical packaging. Or a font that&#39;s as Art Nouveau as possible &#40;whatever you end up thinking that means&#41;. BTW, soon after gettting started in type design for real you might actually end up finding yourself <i>overwhelmed</i> with ideas, and be faced with Puijilittatuq. &#40;Look it up, dude, it&#39;s cool - cold even. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>And whatever you do, don&#39;t let arbitrary circumstances &#40;like a particular marking tool&#41; determine the outcome. &#34;Think with your brain.&#34;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK - so just dive into the deep end, I guess. That is what I was thinking in the first place, but thought it was worth the &#39;ask&#39;. <BR> <BR>I am really interested in the technical aspects of design. So, I am tempted to work on a text face, but I know the complexity of a text face would be overwhelming. <BR> <BR>Maybe I will not make any other commitment other than to start scribbling ides on paper? <BR> <BR>Thanks Dan, Hrant and Forrest for the replies and encouragement. <BR> <BR>Mike</div>
