  at http://www.tammi.fi/? It\u2019s an interesting-looking slab serif, which at first
  reminded me of Joshua Darden\u2019s Freight Micro.\r\n\r\nThe site belongs to a
  Finnish book publisher.\r\n\r\nOlli"

  body: "There are a couple of odd features to these letters, but the one that struck
    me most is that the foot serifs are off-center. I searched with 'tammi' as the
    sample, using 'slabserif' at MyFonts, and went through all 340+ fonts, and the
    only one I noticed there with off-center foot-serifs was <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/corzinair/\">Corzinair</a>
    from Typodermic. As you can see, it's close, but not exact.\r\n\r\nThis says it's
    not a foundry that MyFonts sells, or it's a custom font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I've also searched Veer and FontShop, as well as FontPool. Nothing shown
    as slabserif seems to match this, so it seems like it must be from an independent
    foundry, or custom.\r\n\r\nI'm curious if anyone will pin this one. Olli, have
    you tried writing to the site and asking what they used?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    first place); I was just curious. So I'm kind of embarrashed by the amount of
    work you've done, Mike \u2026 Thank you!\r\n\r\nOlli"
