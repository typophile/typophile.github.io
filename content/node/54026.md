    a visual reflection \u2013 linking with the ability to manage. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Perception_3431.jpg]\r\n\r\nUsing
    this above, or not... but the o in Dot is also a 'dot'. But I'm sure you've seen
    that.\r\n\r\nWhich do U want to emphasise? ability to manage or the unique name
    'Dot'?"

    but I think you probably need to keep going with it and develop it more.\r\n\r\nAlso
    is it me or is the O in dot doing odd things? And I think you need to tighten
    up the space between the first a and the first n in management."

  body: "Also...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DotsInOrder_5905.jpg]\r\nit is
    intersting to know that the size/distance of a space between items is what makes
    our brains group them together.\r\nAgain this could be used to reflect the ability
    to manage 'things'.\r\nI'm very fascinated by perception. The eye sees, but it
    transmits different information to the brain. One kind of information is the info
    about size, shape, colour and alike. The other is orientation, where it's placed
    and it's position in relation to other objects.\r\nThat's is why illusions confuses
    us."

  body: I think you're onto something with the first logo. However you need to work
    on the placement of the dots within the letters - on screen the center of the
    o looks off-center and the dot of the t looks a bit wonky (yep, that's a technical
    term!). I would suggest using a dot in the center of the d as well to see how
    that looks.

    I gave up... \r\n\r\nvisual perception...  a good way to start again... I think
    this may bring some thoughts.... ok one thing i have to ask about.... what is
    the link between perception & managing? do you mean that a good perception leads
    to god managing?\r\n\r\nfor the logos i did... all of them deals with the name
    of dot... now i will work on the other side youve mentioned... management \r\n\r\naha
    aha... now i get you ... you mean the ability to connect dots for example = the
    ability to manage and understand..... \r\n\r\nthanks for the precious advices
    ... this is what i had in college ' cognition '... thanks alot you have been really
    helpful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeter\r\n\r\nwhich one is the third down? i should
    add numbers....sorry\r\n\r\nsure... i will work on it & show you the results\r\n\r\nalso

  body: "top right: \r\nthe grey-dot-name has same colour as the background bar, therefore
    belongs/has a relationship with it. The bar bar is curved (here only in one end)
    and it could be understood as being a 'slice' of a massive dot.\r\n\r\nBlack bar
    with grey name:\r\nwas an earlier stage. And experimenting with the dot, as a
    dot only. And a thought that missing letters rarely is an obstical in reading,
    one often 'fill in' the missing parts in order to make up a meaning.\r\n\r\nBlack
    dot: \r\njust as it is, using same process as above.\r\n\r\nNext 3:\r\nPlaying
    with the negative space in the d. And funny enough.. placed behind it, and moved
    a bit - it's an door opening inwards for the viewer. A nice welcome I thought,
    maybe not appropriate... U know.\r\n\r\nLast 4:\r\nthe grey ink-dot could on all
    items produced be placed at a different position. The Biz card might have the
    dot below the name, the letterhead above, the comp-slip behind it and so on...
    managing the dot in reality. I made it 'ink-like' to create a contrast to the
    typed out name, to add life and emotion/excitement.\r\n\r\n : )   roger over\r\n"

    dot g.\r\n\r\nWorth a try?\r\n\r\n#4 in the second batch may be the strongest
    one but it doesn't look that professional to my eyes. Probably because of the
