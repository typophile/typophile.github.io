    adspeak, like the transcript of a sales pitch. (On the premise advertising is
    \"salesmanship in print\".) With lots of incomplete sentences, and copious paragraph

  body: "Tiffany: <em>If the text is such that the meaning, the phrasing, is most
    important then you should be able to break it as such.</em>\r\n\r\nWhich is, of
    course, one of the ways in which verse is broken into lines, although not the
    only way.\r\n\r\nThai is always broken by phrasing, but in that case the breaking
    is not by lines but using spaces. Individual words within phrases are not spaced.
    This means that Thai would lend itself very easily to the kind of arrangement
    shown in the VSTF method, since the analysis by phrase has already been done,
    and you would only need to replace the space characters with line breaks. I can
    imagine that editing an English text for this method might be an interesting task.
    It seems to me that what the VSTF method is doing a lot of is extra-visualising
    punctuation, i.e. they are using linebreaks to emphasise things that are already
    explicit in a well-punctuated text. Of course, a lot of punctuation is stylistically
    discretionary, so the linebreaks can also be compensatory for absent punctuation.
    This means someone is making editorial decisions about possibly ambiguous phrasing.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, the whole thing rests on the assumption that the text in question has
    a singular meaning that can be determined by breakdown of phrases. Recently I've
    been talking with Fiona Ross and Robert Bringhurst about Sanskrit examples in
    which entire sentences are written without punctuation or word breaks in order
    to be deliberately ambiguous. Fiona cited examples by the writer Bana, in which
    a sentence might have three different meanings, depending how you divided it up."

    is easier to grasp by the reader. I started looking for natural breaks in sentences
    when setting introductory (usually centered) type. I then moved to asymmetrical
    settings because of my dislike for centered type.\r\n\r\nThe example below is
    taken from a client's 1997 annual report. The bodycopy (ITC Officina Sans) is
    set justified on two columns. The asymmetrical type treatment shown was used to
    introduce each of six sections throughout the book (always on a right-hand page).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Text1_6701.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n(I
    apologize for the use of Trajan)\r\n\r\nI would never consider setting an entire
    book with this asymmetrical treatment. But I feel it offers a good counterpoint
    to more regular body settings. It doesn't need to look like poetry or haiku. That
    can be controlled by the typesetter.\r\n\r\nHere's a more recent example (using
    TheMix):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Text2_6134.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt
    all comes down to care and attention to detail. Utilizing natural line breaks,
    checking line endings, adjusting the rag when necessary, identifying and removing
    rivers...that's all part of being a good typesetter. \r\n\r\nStill, I am completely
    opposed to having type set by an algorithm. The samples provided by LiveInk are
    rife with rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Ken"
