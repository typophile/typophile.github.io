    so many unfinished pixel types, they dwell in the darkness of greyscale tiffs
    and see the light about once a month. If I had this program

  body: 'Grayscale pixelfonts allow a designer to define the pixels as being a shade
    of gray, not just black or white. They do this by filling the &#34;virtual pixels&#34;
    with partial outlines. Please see the &#34;A&#34; that I just posted in this thread:

    <BR>That glyph has a height of 12 pixels. <BR> <BR>Some of us think there&#39;s
    no better form of onscreen text, not even ClearType. <BR> <BR>It would be wonderful
    if BItFonter could output grayscale pixelfonts too. <BR>You might want to talk
    to the UltraFonts people about it: <BR><a href="http://www.ultrafonts.com" target="_blank">http://www.ultrafonts.com</a>
