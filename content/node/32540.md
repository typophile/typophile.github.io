  and studying Art Direction?\r\n\r\nI recently found out that my school offers Art
  Direction.  Personally, I've always been better at recognizing problems and putting
  things together than coming up with the ideas myself.  But then I looked at the
  course lists, and its basically the same classes.  The only difference is basically
  a class on copywriting vs. a class on package design.\r\n\r\nWhat do you know about
  the two majors?  I could follow either one at this point with no losses, but does
  it really matter?\r\n\r\nI radther take this package design course than the copywriting
  course, but thats the only thing."

    yourself than neither direction would be a good fit for you since creative ideas
    are at the core of the profession.\r\n\r\nAs far as a direct answer to your question.
    I'd assume the Art Direction major would be geared more towards the advertising
    field."

  body: "Some people are more cerebral, others are natural wellsprings of unbridled
    creativity bristling at the seams. For instance, I'm personally not that good
    at randomly coming up with cool art. I have to really focus and come up with a
    concept. Others can point their magic finger at a pile of trash, proclaim \"Art!\"
    with a capital A, and it becomes just so.\r\n\r\nThe point is, each of us has
    our own talents, and being able to recognize talent in others and being able to
    organize them together is in itself a talent. \r\n\r\nAs to the Art Direction/Graphic
    Design degree, since they'e almost exactly the same, why not get both? Dual major.
    Remember though, even if you have a degree that says \"Art Director\" doesn't
    mean that you will get that specific job. You will always have to pay your dues
    and start out as a Jr.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As Ken rightly says, Art Direction would be geared towards advertising, marketing
    and sales promotion. Culturally and conceptually there is a big difference between
    these activities and the rest of graphic design. \r\n\r\n'Art Direction' is quite
    a misnomer because while ADs are typically paired with copywiters in ad agencies
    as creative two-person teams \u2013 no ad agency team I've spoken to has ever
    defined their work as an exact split between words and images; both parties are
    'creatives' who are employed to come up with vast quantities of fresh ideas to
    shift product. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, the advertising/art direction educational
    programmes that I've seen firsthand tend to put students through large amounts
    of ideas generation \u2013 which doesn't sound like your strongest suite. Although
    the visible effects of advertising art direction may appear disparate, the conceptual
    toolkit required is really quite small and very sharply honed.\r\n\r\nConversely,
    your abilities with <em>recognizing problems and putting things together </em>
    make you sound like a natural for general graphic design, including packaging."

  body: "speaking personally, the graphic design degree curriculum sounds better.
    many, many designers become art directors -- often right out of school -- so i
    don't feel the AD track holds that many benefits, esp. if one would truly enjoy
    doing graphics work as well.\r\nhone that \"recognizing problems\" skill, because
    it will be invaluable whether you're a designer or an AD.\r\ni'm not sure about
    the belief that art directors mainly work in advertising, sales or promotion.
    they are also involved in every realm of graphic arts."

  body: "Eric,\r\n\r\nI think you should reconsider the copywriting vs the packaging
    course. One course in package design is not going to give you much, but a copywriting
    course can really give you some insight and skill. Most designers are lousy writers,
    and writing is what you need to separate your self from the rest. If you ever
    get into the advertising world, it is the copy and account people who throw the
    most weight. Those art directors are rarely thought about past their last layout.
    Even if you never do the ad agency thing, good writing is a skill you should have."

  body: As an art director, I can tell you that my job is more concept-oriented than
    that of a designer. As pointed out above, the same core competencies are needed
    for both jobs. Do you enjoy more developing concepts and picking the right elements
    (fonts, illustrations, photography) and the people to pull them off, or doing
    the hands-on design work yourself? It's not that designers never come up with
    concepts or ADs never do design, but it comes down to how much time you invest
    in those two areas. Once you've been an AD for 3-5 years, you should be able to
    come up with headlines and copy points (not necessarily finished copy) and a CW
    should be able to come up with visuals (though not necessarily be able to art
    direct a photo shoot). If that is something you want to do, go the AD route. But
    really, school only begins your education -- you'll be learning for the rest of
    your life. So if the "designer" courses appeal to you more right now, take 'em.

  body: 'Good writing is a skill <em> everyone </em> should have, and we''re progressively
    losing it. It makes me sound prematurely ancient to say it, but my undergraduate
    students are so much <em>less</em> capable with both their spoken and written
    language than their predecessors. I find it unavoidably depressing. Young designers
    especially need to get over themselves about their innate antipathy towards words.  '

  body: "It's unfortunate that you'd have to choose between learning package design
    or copywriting. It also seems odd that Art Direction and Graphic Design are two
    different majors. \r\n\r\nI'd say you'll use the copywriting skills in almost
    every aspect of design, whereas package design is more specialized. Honestly,
    anyone with a strong core knowledge of design could probably apply it to packaging
    and learn it quite easily (I hope I'm not offfending any lifelong package designers
    by saying that). \r\n\r\nToo many designers are dependent on other people (some
    with very little experience) to provide them with copy. Copy can make or break
    a concept. To be able to skillfully craft a simple headline or a good tagline
    is essential to the design process, and not an innate ability of everyone claiming
    to be designers. Also, it will make you all the more appealing to your prospective
    client/employer."
