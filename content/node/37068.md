  a more modern logo for use on some guitar products we have coming out in the fall.
  \ Any thoughts,  likes or dislikes - here's a few ideas:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logofarm3_4801.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  font is Fontin Sans with a 4 degree shear applied in Illustrator\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance!"

  body: "What happened to dot on the 'i'!\r\nI definitely like that revised one better.
    I'm thinking perhaps the typeface isn't quite the right fit. You've got a lovely
    vintage feel with the graphic and I'd love to see a typeface with even a slight
    retro/vintage feel to it.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of guitar I think of script-like
    typefaces but either modified or custom-made logotype.\r\n\r\nI believe you need
    to find a way to get the graphic to fit with the type, at the moment it they feel
    separate\u2014and they definitely are, looking at your original concepts. "

    designed our current Script font logo a couple of years ago and I am starting
    to dislike it, first because it is very reminiscent of one of our main competitors,
    but most importantly because it covers a large amount of vertical room, making
    it hard to fit on some of our newer products, like 7mm diamater cabling and stratocaster
    pickups (check out www.tonerider.com if you have no idea what they are).  Here's
    the script logo we currently use on packaging but not on products.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logoblack150_5734.gif]\r\n\r\nAlso
    some of the letter forms are just plain ugly, like the \"e's.  "

  body: "The thinner text looks better. Perhaps you can sland the graphic the same
    angle as the name is.\r\nI like the current logo, but you are right about all
    the guitar brands who also have a script logo. It\u2019s good to seperate from
    them.\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: I like the thinner, and would even farther in that direction, but I'm not
    sold on the font, or the shear, which I find disconcerting. Fontin has an Italic
    you might consider.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tonerider_4302.gif] or
    smallcaps. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/toneridersm_3819.gif]

    is clean? If so the thinner weights would convey that better than the heavy, imo.
    But if the word you'd use is fat, then never mind.\r\n; )"

  body: "litera - the logo critique forum?  ouch, didn't know there was one.  should
    I move it, or repost?\r\n\r\nThe shear reminds of the Eras family, which is a
    good thing for me, although they were hopelessly overused a few years ago.  \r\n\r\nAs
    for the sound, we do everything from vintage \"clean\" products to some fairly
    high output stuff - for example a new British-style distortion box is in the works
    that can really scream.  Describing tone in words is hard, but in a font.  I suppose
    that's why I am posting here!  "

  body: One other idea that came to me that fits in with the name and product is to
    have a little occilating soundwave form trailing off the end of the 'r'. Like
    the name is sustaining. It would take someone with more drawing ability than me
    to pull it off.

  body: "Hi Andrew.\r\n\r\nCan't you adjust the existing logo rather than create a
    new. Don't know if the type is appropriate (i would have to know more about the
    product) but it is so much nicer than your new options. The T could be reduced
    (it is slightly thicker which will make it fit better if you reduce it (some space
    saved already) then you could decrease the angle slightly and get rid of pickup
    (some more space saved). Definetly get rid of the shear. Applying stuff like forced
    italics and shears is just a big no-no."

  body: "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nWell, a new logo it was...and Fontin Sans saved the day.
    \ I love this Font, a great mix of the suprising and the familar.\r\n\r\nI mixed
    it with Gill Sans (can't remember which weight of the top of my head) to create
    one of our new products - a compressor effects pedal.  The prototypes are all
    done and we are working on the production tooling.  Here's a view - what do you
    think, font friends?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CP-1small_3956.jpg]\r\n\r\nBTW
    this is a real photo of a real screenprinted prototype, not a rendering, before
    you ask.   I can't render 3D knobs that look this good."

    \r\n\r\nAre you going to have an analog delay? I prefer that to digital because
    the decay is a nice ethereal effect for flute. Right now I am using an old pink
    Boss that I'm told is a collector's item now (I think I bought it in '80). Someday
    it will probably die."
