body: Hi Everyone, <BR> <BR>It was great to meet so many of you for the first time
  and to catch up with TypeCon friends who I had fallen out of touch with. I&#39;d
  like to echo some of you who have already stated just how  informative and friendly
  the conference is. I&#39;m simply amazed at how well it has progressed. The very
  first one set the tone and it is still ringing true. Okay, that&#39;s a bit cheesy
  but you know what I mean.

  body: Well, I&#39;m slowly getting back to reality.  <BR> <BR>TypeCon was great
    and it was wonderful to meet so  <BR>many of you. I think, for the most part,
    I was able to  <BR>express to you just how much I admire some of you  <BR>and
    what wonderful inspirations you are. If I didn&#39;t  <BR>get the chance this
    year, I&#39;m  <BR>hoping for the next. I&#39;m planning to be there and  <BR>I
    hope you will be as well. <BR> <BR>The highlights were many and the biggest was
    of course  <BR>being in the same room as all of you. <BR> <BR>Other great points,
    for me, were; <BR> <BR>1&#41; <b>Peter Bilak&#39;s presentation</b> <BR>2&#41;
    <b>Stuart&#39;s LazyDrinker</b> <BR>3&#41; <b>Some great spacing and kerning files  <BR>from
    Bitstream</b> <BR>4&#41; <b>Knowing I can only do better on next  <BR>years type
    quiz.</b> <i>&#40; I actually won the most  <BR>typographically challenged prize.
    Thanks Keith and Tiffany,  <BR>for humoring me and grading my test. &#41;</i>
    <BR> <BR>There are way to many good things to talk about. <BR> <BR>I should try
    to post later when I am more together.  <BR>It is actually a little hard to get
    my head around it all. <BR> <BR><b>The biggest surprise;</b> Kent on the dance
    floor. <BR> <BR>Kent, you can really tear a rug up! Nice. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Glad to meet and talk to many of you. Because of TypeCon, I have about four
    new projects &#40;both design and research&#41; I want to pursue. I rarely ever
    write anything down, but I kept digging out my pink pad to jot down what was running
    through my head. For a young guy like me, this was a great experience. It was
    very inspiring. Thanks, everyone.

  body: John, Hrant --  <BR> <BR>Matthew was commissioned recently to create a new  <BR>design
    to be cut in wood type by the Hamilton Wood  <BR>Type &amp; Printing Museum in
    Two Rivers, WI. &#40;Carter says  <BR>the invitation caused him to realize that
    wood was, in  <BR>fact, a technology that he had never created type for  <BR>before.&#41;
    His design is an all-caps, chunky, latin-serif  <BR>design and is called Carter
    Latin. One of the more  <BR>notable aspects of the design is that it has two variants  <BR>--
    a positive and a negative -- which can be combined  <BR>for interesting figure-ground
    interrelationships. The  <BR>typeface is done, but the font is still being manufactured,  <BR>I
    think. Matthew confessed that last weekend was the  <BR>first time he&#39;s actually
    seen it. It will be available in  <BR>wood, one size only for now, I believe --
    12-line &#40;about  <BR>2 inches&#41;. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s nothing about this
    project on the <a href="http://www.woodtype.org" target="_blank"> Hamilton website</a>
    yet. <BR> <BR>Matthew has the rights to produce a digital font, but says  <BR>he&#39;s
    not inclined to do it any time soon, so that the  <BR>Hamilton can have a measure
    of exclusivity for a while. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    in the Goldstein Gallery at the University of Minnesota earlier this year. I had
    the pleasure of admiring the type at that time and after a quick google search
    discovered that the font was already available digitally. Unfortunately I missed
    98% of  Carter&#39;s presentation, but it&#39;s exciting that the Hamilton Woodtype
    Museum is undertaking the creation of new typefaces in wood.'

    a Chilean vernacular unique specimen or something? Of course not.  <BR> <BR>In
    this days, one of the things now in Southamerica i guess, is the discuss about
    identity in graphic design, and the production of a local typeface scene.  <BR>
    <BR>In some of the details about the serifs and proportions in my rescue are &#34;vernaculal&#34;
    i guess, related to the imperfection maybe...thats pretty latino. <BR> <BR>M.

  body: The process for creating the Hamilton Offset typeface was interesting. It
    reminded me of the deconstructed type in the 90s, but it&#39;s far from it. I
    think it&#39;s great that they are still interested in making new woodtype. Matthew
    Carter&#39;s design is great. And as expected, he did something that&#39;s just
    a little bit different! Hey, let&#39;s organize a trip to Two Rivers!

  body: 'The funniest thing at TypeCon: <BR>When Si introduced himself as moderator
    of the Blog and  <BR>Communities panel and said, &#34;I&#39;m Si Daniels and I
    work for  <BR>Microsoft. Sorry about that.&#34; <BR> <BR>The most frustrating
    moment: <BR>Scoring a 6 on that &#42;lousy type quiz &#40;okay 8, if I give myself  <BR>2
    points for getting my name right&#41;. I had to second  <BR>Stephen&#39;s assertion
    that it needed some questions from  <BR><i>this</i> half of the last century.
    &#40;&#42;No offense Kent, it&#39;s just  <BR>that you have to come down to the
    rest of our levels to  <BR>speak to us. Haha. I guess next year I should do some  <BR>homework.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>The warmest fuzzy: <BR>Realizing that the people you&#39;ve looked up
    to forever are  <BR>genuinely warm, friendly people. &#40;Awww.&#41; <BR> <BR>The
    truest prediction: <BR>Jill Bell lamented that the Mac OS Finder should be able
    to  <BR>recognize and activate fonts by double clicking them. The  <BR>guy from
    Apple granted her wish 4 hours later when he  <BR>gave a demo of Apple&#39;s Mac
    OS X update, Panther &#40;Mac OS  <BR>X 2.6&#41;. <BR> <BR>The strangest moment:
    <BR>Sitting at lunch with Delve Withrington, hoping he doesn&#39;t  <BR>notice
    me staring, thinking <i>Is he really an immortal vampire?</i> <BR>By the end of
    the conference I still couldn&#39;t tell... <BR> <BR>The second worst moment:
    <BR>Realizing that our room did not have high speed internet  <BR>access. <BR>
    <BR>The worst moment: <BR>Realizing that, not only did our room not have high
    speed  <BR>internet access, but that the hotel&#39;s &#34;business center&#34;  <BR>consisted
    of a single PC and a single chair in a closet-sized  <BR>space that was constantly
    occupied. &#40;I humbly suggest that  <BR>TypeCon &#39;04 be held at San Francisco&#39;s
    wireless enabled  <BR>Herbst Theater or similarly equipped venue for us tech-
    <BR>spoiled kids.&#41; <BR> <BR>Biggest regret: <BR>Flying on Priceline. Leaving
    Sunday morning. Essentially we  <BR>missed the one day of the conference that
    was dominated  <BR>by people of my own generation -- Test Pilot, Miniml,  <BR>Aesthetic
    Apparatus among others. <BR> <BR>The simplest pleasure: <BR>Watching Jim Parkinson
    beaming like a proud parent over  <BR>the pages of Indie Fonts 2. The book itself
    was a catalyst  <BR>for a pile of his recent releases. I&#39;m sure he was both  <BR>relieved
    to have the work done and proud of the showings.  <BR>Note to self: invite Jim
    over for Sunday dinner sometime. <BR> <BR>Funnest time: <BR>Sharing a panel with
    Si, Jon, Armin, Stephen and Jared.  <BR>There were some genuine good laughs. I&#39;m
    glad we could  <BR>pull off a smoke screen so that not everyone realized  <BR>that
    we were sitting up there modeling the emperor&#39;s new  <BR>wardrobe.'
