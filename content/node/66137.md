  geometry but with a modern feel? \r\nSomething like gotham will not work as i'm
  looking for a font with terminals paralel to baseline like in avant garde or helvetica.\r\n\r\nAll
  sugestions are very welcome\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nBest regards"

    \u201Cterminals paralel to the baseline\u201D. Are you talking about how Gothams
    terminals are at an angle, as opposed to completely vertical or horizontal? Perhaps
    you'd like <a href=\"http://typographica.org/2008/typeface-reviews/graphik/\">Graphik</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.vllg.com/Village/Galaxie_Polaris#panel=poster\">Galaxie
    Polaris</a>? (The latter doesn't have the 90 degree terminals, but they are rather
    close to it.) Another one that might be of interest is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/neuzeit-grotesk/\">Neuzeit
    Grotesk</a>."

    what I was trying to say :). I'm looking for something whitout that angle. And
    yes helvetica is not as geometric as avant garde, I was just refering it as an
    example about it's terminals.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks a lot for your sugestions...
    very nice, Galaxie Polaris might be just what they're looking for.\r\n\r\nStill
    open to another suggestions though"
