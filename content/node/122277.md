body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PLATE 030_6663.jpg]\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nJust
  to introduce myself, I manufacture obsolete components for old Land-Rovers (pre-1984
  models).\r\n\r\nOne spin-off is to reproduce the sort of data plate shown above.
  This was riveted to capstan winches fitted to Land-Rovers from about 1971 onwards.
  We have had a request to have new plates made and would like to use the correct
  fonts.\r\n\r\nThe 'Fairey Winches' font appears to be different to the rest of the
  text (dot of i and the y differ).\r\n\r\nPlate is about 112mm x 30mm.\r\n\r\nBest
  regards and Happy New Year,\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The angled top bar of the F and the high contrast between thick/thin (a,
    h, n) seem to rule out Monotype Grotesque Bold.\r\nThe /a/ in Fairey is different
    from the /a/ in the rest of the text.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fw_6716.jpg]"

  body: "Not necessarily. Keep in mind that we are dealing with the pre-digital era
    here (I\u2019m assuming the plate dates from the 1970s, given the information
    supplied by the original poster), and other weights of the face do not have that
    angled terminal on the F:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MTGrotesque_5758.png]\r\n\r\nI
    displayed the bold because the overall letter forms seemed to be the best match,
    but given that it is a logo it may well be a mix of several weights, or a heavier
    weight, that has been customized.\r\n\r\nIf you think there is a better candidate
    that fits the historical time frame, by all means post it.\r\n\r\nThe person seeking
    the ID already stated that there are two fonts he needed help identifying, that\u2019s
    why I posted the suggestion of Univers for the balance of the text. Neue Haus
    Grotesque might also work for the smaller text:\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/nhg/\r\n\r\nBut
    all of this is provisional without a larger, higher-resolution sample...."
