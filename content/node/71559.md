    is not really a news face either, which is why Peter Bil'ak produced Greta.\r\n\r\nFor
    text, one must consider the large amount of press gain that occurs on newsprint
    paper.\r\nFor headlines, one must consider the length of extenders in multi-line
    settings, and how the face sets when tracking is reduced, among other things.\r\n\r\nFurther
    to my comment on Comic Sans, I *seriously* question your pursuit of \"friendliness\".
    Faces which you deem friendly, such as Expo and Novel, are too soft and shapeless
    for news design, which requires instead styles which are dispassionate and authoritative.
    \r\n\r\nFor many reasons, news type is one of the narrowest, most conservative
    areas of typography. Unless you have some experience in the genre, it's best to
    not stray too far from the conventions."

    printing conditions typical for bible printing results in a need for a more solid
    design. This is a similar brief as it would be for a newspaper font, so no wonder
    a paper actually picked it up. It is unique enough to stand out, but still very
    legible, although in this sample paper I wouldn't mind a tad more leading. As

    You mentioned Gulliver and Swift, these fonts have short ascenders and descenders

    this way. But if space isn't an issue, you can choose something more traditional.\r\n\r\nAlso,

    consistent widths of the lower case letters, the squarishness of the curves, and
    the narrow space character, further contribute to a lack of sparkle. The soft
    and nuanced finish which imparts friendliness when the face is inspected closely
    is a display quality, and will be problematic in text practice, especially for
    your particular audience.\r\n\r\nHowever, the short capitals and old style figures
    add interest, and it could be an OK magazine face, if the fit is opened up here
    and there.\r\n\r\nThink of your readers. What's friendly for them will be something
