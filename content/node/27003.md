body: OK, so when should ragged right  be hyphenated? I prefer a hard rag, but I can
  see how hyphenation might save a little space and make the rag a bit less jagged.  <BR>
  <BR>Also, I wonder what you all think about ragged right captions under photos.
  This seems to make sense to me, and yet I do see publications that H&amp;J their
  captions. This seems to lead to inferior overall spacing. Any thoughts?
