body: "I came across this news item today:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/01/25/arabic_programming_language/]]\r\n\r\nIt
  seems on-topic because of one specific characteristic of the language mentioned
  in the article:\r\n\r\n<cite>By varying the lengths of the lines that connect the
  Arabic letters that make up the language's commands, Nasser can reshape the appearance
  of his code without altering its function, producing programs that are both practical
  and artistic.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe means by which that feature is implemented using
  ordinary Arabic typefaces, though, may clash with the use of more authentic Naksh
  typefaces which already have kashida."
