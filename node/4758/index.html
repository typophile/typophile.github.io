  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Heya 'philes, <BR> <BR>Can anyone explain (or point me somewhere that explains) about typographic standards in legal documents - such as End User License Agreements?

Ostensibly, these are in capitals because they are more important; the irony of course being that this type is the most difficult to read of all. <BR> <BR>I looked at this thread about business documents and wasn't led to believe that there were any legal obligations to the typographic standards (akin to cheques being invalid when signed in red ink). <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/28059.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/28059.html">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/28059.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>Is this simply an aesthetic default by the legal profession?

There is a minimum type size required by law, or the contractual information is not considered binding. I had an acquaintance get out of a contract based on this defense. I can't recall the measure off hand but it is based on old Linotype metal type size standards. Linotype was used in setting legal documents because of oft required line changes that were facilitated by the Linotype process. And, though not used much anymore, the metal type size is still the legal standard.  <BR>  <BR>Gerald</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As a lawyer, I think I can comment generally, though of course details vary from place to place. Needless to say, my response should not be taken as giving legal advice to anyone about how to draft their contracts! <BR> <BR>(1) There are very few formal standards for typefaces in legal documents like contracts. Courts do sometimes have quite detailed standards, specifying minimum size etc. The Supreme Court of the United States, for instance requires documents to be in type no smaller than what it thinks is 11 point (which it ascertains by measuring the apparent size of the type: Times 11 point, eg, fails). <BR> <BR>(2) There often are standards which require particular clauses to be made prominent if they are to be effective. To that extent the &quot;prominence&quot; of particular clauses may matter. One judge said that some clauses were so unfair and unexpected that they ought to be written in red bold type with a hand pointing to them in the margin. <BR> <BR>(3) Attempts are often made to &quot;incorporate&quot; contractual terms by placing them on the back of documents which are not inherently contractual. For instance, an invoice (since ex hypothesi it is issued after the agreement has been made) is not obviously a &quot;contract document&quot;. Yet it often attempts to incorporate terms. Similarly with tickets and so forth. In these cases, the prominence and obviousness of the contractual terms may matter. <BR> <BR>(4) Contrary to what is generally believed, I do not believe that the use of small type stems from any desire on the part of the lawyer to make terms hard to read. The lawyer, when s/he wishes to obfuscate, does it by using incomprehensible language, not invisible ink. It flows, I think, simply from a practical desire to cram a lot of text into a confined space. When lawyers do not have space constraints, they generally opt for legible (though not always readable) typography. <BR> <BR>(5) On the whole, the lawyers would always be happy to have the type larger. It tends to be the client and the designers who want small type. Clients generally don't like reminding their customers more than they absolutely must that they are entering into a legal transaction at all. It's a passion killer. <BR> <BR>(6) No doubt typographical help could improve these dreadful documents. But the underlying problem is one of wordiness in a confined space. The real remedy is rewriting in clear language: a lawyer's job, not a typographer's. <BR> <BR>(7) Many of the contracts one sees are hopelessly badly drafted. Many of them would fail to prove enforceable in court. But people go on using terms that are unfair or unenforceable, because experience shows that most people do not go to court, and do not know their rights. And from inertia and conservatism, two well-known friends of the law.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Avante Garde hurts my stomach every time I see it.  In the mid-eightys, when the computer industry chose Avante Garde as one of the original 35 &quot;freebe&quot; fonts included with every laser printer, it made me ill to think that the world would be flooded by pages of it instead of something well designed like Futura.  Luckilly, computer companies are more likely to consult good typgraphers these days. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>
