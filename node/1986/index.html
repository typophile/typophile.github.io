		<div class="commentbody">Concerning what Rich Roat wrote (!) concerning his well-placed preoccupation with craft, in the context of this good-samaritan-style contest allow me to make the following suggestion: <BR> <BR>Maybe the submissions should be regarded as only nearly-finished, and the winner should be: <BR>1. Judged based on the assumption (or rather the hope) that -once chosen- the designer will refine it before production. <BR>2. Provided with (entirely voluntary) recommendations by the judges as to how to improve the craft (but no recommendations concerning the concept). These recommendations can be taken up by the designer, or not. <BR> <BR>I think it should be a balance between concept and craft (not letting the latter take absolute precedence) - and I suspect many or all of the judges might agree. A shirt with horrible craft shouldn't be chosen, but one with a great concept that just needs polish shouldn't be discarded as-is, for the simple reason that it takes too long to make it user-ready to justify the largely intagible gain from the weak possiblity of winning - this thing has turned out to be pretty competitive. When you know you've won, you're much more motivated to finish it up for real. <BR> <BR>Also, a question: is it possible to revise a submission, or should people simply submit a new version alongside? <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My take on contests is that you submit your best work. If you don't have time to do your best work, don't submit it. Contests are non-revenue projects, so I don't think they should be regarded as &quot;spec work&quot;. And having printed a few t-shirts myself, I'm sure Jared &amp; co. are not going to suddenly be the recipients of a financial windfall on the sales of the new typophile t-shirt. Anything they do make, they certainly deserve for creating this great forum.  <BR> <BR>If some of the folks commenting in this discussion are creating entries for this contest, maybe you spend more time creating a good design rather than thinking of excuses and rationalizations for a bad one.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On the other hand, it's probably safe to say that the better a graphic designer, the less time he has to design a shirt with no reward and minimal prospects of success. My point is that if you make the &quot;polishing&quot; provisional (to be applied to the winner only), and you make that fact clear, you then open to door to greater and higher-quality submissions, even if they're of an &quot;exploratory&quot; nature. Look at it this way: the designer is submitting nearly-finished work-in-progress to the client. This is important because this client is a mute until the moment of truth. <BR> <BR>Free work is to be encouraged. But choosing the judging parameters carefully helps improve the eventual results. In fact, the official judging guidelines say nothing about highly exacting craftsmanship. Maybe that was an -unwitting- good &quot;feature&quot; of this contest? <BR> <BR>Anyway, I don't mean to whine. I think one great side-benefit of this contest is that it serves as a tool to learn how to do this better next time. This type of thing is a novelty, with a lot of potential, and it can only improve with critical real-world testing. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
