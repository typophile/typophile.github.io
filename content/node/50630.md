  and the teacher has assigned a project that was inspired by Typophile.  It is ligature
  based symbols.  We are supposed to think 50 years into the future, rethink and rewrite
  a ligature for LOL, AIH, ILY, BTW.  I honestly don''t have a clue where to begin.
  Can anyone help?  D '

  body: ligatures in the past have either been stylistic, or to resolve the issues
    of typesetting. The "fi" ligature is one with a more practical aesthetic goal
    -- with normal even spacing, the top of the f would overlap the i, creating an
    ugly blob, so type designers long ago created an "fi" character that looks cleaner.
    There are other ligatures that are more for the sake of evoking a certain feel,
    less practical than the "fi" ligature. http://www.dstype.com/capsa.html << Dino
    dos Santos' fonts have a lot of these ligatures, like the "ip" ligature. Typically,
    these sorts of ligatures are associated with giving off a classical, old-timey
    feel. But as your teacher's assignment hints towards, ligatures may have a future
    purpose as well -- commonly used acronyms could be made into one character with
    a distinctive shape. I would read up on the history of the "&", and how it evolved
    from the Latin "et," meaning "and." This is essentially what your assignment is.
    I think what most of your classmates will do, and what I think you should veer
    away from, is typing out "LOL" in Illustrator, then trying to morph the bottom
    leg of the L into the O, and then morphing the top right of the O in the lop of
    the last L. To me, this is just arbitrary shape making. I would revisit the &
    as a means of of making it easier for those writing long lengths of text to write
    the word "et" faster. In the case of modern texting shorthand, the goal is not
    to necessarily make the handwriting easier, but to save glyph space, as cell phone
    screens are small and it's laborious to write out full words with a phone. So
    I would look at the typeface your phone uses, and the default font your IM application
    uses, and use those as a starting point for your ligature. Then, I would think
    about the meaning of each word, and how that could be expressed in the shape of
    he ligature. Maybe you incorporate in other punctuation marks, like a question
    mark, or exclamation point.
