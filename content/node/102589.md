  and reading through these forums has helped me along tremendously. I'm running into
  some issues with font naming recently that I haven't had the luck of getting resolved
  by reading what's already here, so I thought I'd reach out.\r\n\r\nEssentially what
  I'm trying to create is a family of six styles that appear in Adobe applications
  as styles 300\u2013800. This is working great, but I'm also wondering if it's possible
  create three pairs with a regular & bold relationship, without having to change
  the family name. Ideally I'd like to pair off 300 & 600, 400 & 700, and 500 & 800,
  with the first style being considered a \"regular\" weight in the Microsoft Office,
  and the second style being considered \"bold.\" I've noticed that many large font
  families have only one weight with the \"font is bold\" box checked, and I'm wondering
  if this is just a technical limitation.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to be make it so that
  end users can easily hit the bold button for the styles 300, 400, and 500 and end
  up with the correct \"bold\" style being displayed, without affecting how the styles
  appear in Adobe applications? If not, is there a way to disable the ability to auto-bold
  so that the bold button in Office at least does nothing?\r\n\r\nAny advice would
  be really helpful, and please let me know if this info is already somewhere in the
  forums so I can read up.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help,\r\nSam"
