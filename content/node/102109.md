  with the genereted font file .ttf because the file size is too large and make the
  preview of it very slow. It also making word slowing down. The size is nearly 1900

  points is too hard because i made a \"destroy\" font.\r\n\r\nAnything i can do to
  reduce the size of the generated font file ??\r\n\r\nThanks a lot\r\n\r\nGuilhem"
