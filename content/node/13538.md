  Addison Dwiggins was an accomplished type designer, illustrator, and graphic designer
  (he even invented the term [[Graphic Design]]!).\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the century,
  Dwiggins went to Chicago to study at the [[Frank Holmes School of Illustration]],
  where he was one of [[Frederic Goudy]]'s first pupils.\r\n\r\nIn 1927, his famous
  book [[Layout in Advertising]] was published. He was one of design's first critical
  voices. One of his common critiques was that type foundries were not making type
  that was appropriate enough. He disliked European moderns, like [[Futura]], [[Kabel]],
  and [[Erbar]]. [[Mergenthaler Linotype]] charged him to do better, and he did, creating
  [[Metro]], his first typeface.\r\n\r\nHe would go on to work with [[Chauncey H.
  Griffith]] at Mergenthaler Linotype to create [[Electra]] and [[Caledonia]], as
  well as several other designs that unfortunately were not published.\r\n\r\nTypefaces
  designed by William Addison Dwiggins, including his experiments. The dates shown
  reflect the time period in which WAD worked on that experimental number:\r\n\r\n[[Metro]]
