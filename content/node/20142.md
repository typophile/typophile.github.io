  aim is to express norwegian values through a typeface. I was hoping that you guys,
  could help me out in the initial stage. As i guess there is not many norwegians
  here, although some might be familiar with my country, i would appreciate if you
  know about other similar project, good books, links on the internet, or just thoughts
  and comments about how i should get started.\r\n\r\nI have been looking into swiss
  typography and i know there is a obvious link. Also german blackletters inspired
  norwegian typography in the early days.\r\n\r\nHope you can help me out in some
  way.\r\n\r\nthx.\r\n\r\nhenrik fjeldberg "

  body: "Except for the modern links above, you might have found a slim topic. I grew
    up around Norwegian-Americans but none of them designed fonts. Even a Norwegian
    type designer is going to be challenged to single out (cultural?) \"values\" that
    can be translated into a unique typeface. Besides this, most typefaces are designed
    to express something in a particular kind of document, or something slightly less
    broad than a national \"something\". Even if one were trying to compose an exclusively
    \"Norwegian-looking\" document of some kind, one would need to travel back to
    a time before the Latin alphabet was use in order to be clear of Sweden, Denmark,
    or Spiekermann.\r\n\r\nNow in Boston, we have a single letter, a \"B\",  in a
    specific font, that sums the whole culture up. NY, being twice as mouthy and not
    nearly as discerning, needs two letters and the font doesn't matter. Most other
    places, Seattle, the Bahamas or Milwaukee, e.g. have nothing much to show for
    themselves typographically."

  body: "Henrik,\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could focus some of your research on how Norway
    has used design to project a national image to an international audience. \r\n\r\nThis
    would include the Norwegian tourist authority and, obviously, the design work
    done for the Lillehammer Olympics. \r\n\r\nIt might be interesting to speak with
    some of the people involved in these campaigns, because they had to deal with
    the very issue in which you are interested, although embracing issues beyond typography.
    \r\n\r\nAs a balance, it might be usefull to look at trends in Norwegian art,
    writing, music and film, as they relate to popular culture.\r\n\r\nThis idea that
    a particular culture can be captured in type is interesting. I believe that there
    is some truth to it, but that it is an  elusive idea among countries that share
    a common cultural heritage. \r\n\r\nI assume that you have seen Kitchen Stories,
    which would be an interesting, and amusing, point of embarkation for a project
    like this if you want to be whimsical. \r\n\r\nGood luck. "

    but it is the first thought that came to my mind.
