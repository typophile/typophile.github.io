body: Given the recent revolution in web font technology, I find this an interesting
  question. Will we see web fonts with extended symbol coverage?

  body: "I'm not sure what you mean by \"symbol coverage\" but the answer is surely
    yes.\r\nWhy wouldn't web fonts with all kinds of code points be used? It's not
    like the browser has to support a particular range or something like that.\r\nIt's
    just a lookup.\r\nEither the font has the character or it doesn't. And then, if
    the fallbacks don't have it either, you get the black box."
