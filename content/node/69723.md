body: "So I was using my Williams Caslon font to set a book, and decided to use the
  \"all small caps\" option. This was to access the (ahem) very cool feature of special
  small caps figures and parens, to create discrete citations for display quotes.
  \r\n\r\nI tried at first setting up a \"character style\" to do this, as in that
  dialogue box you have the option of choosing \"open type all small caps\". But when
  I saw the result, I freaked out, because the numbers were too small, and there was
  no kerning to the colon, and it looked a wreck. \r\n\r\nHad I hallucinated doing
  all that sizing and kerning of small cap figures? Then the penny dropped: fake small
  caps. InDesign wasn't using the small caps figures or the kerning in the font, but
  creating awful fake ones, with no kerning. When I formatted the citations directly
  using the fly-out open type panel, choosing \"all small caps,\" and everything looked
  good, with all the kerning. Relief. \r\n\r\nBut it ought to be possible to create
  a character style that uses real \"all small caps.\" Is the problem of the \"character
  styles\" creating fake small caps for \"all small caps\" a bug in Indesign CS4?
  Is it corrected in CS5?  "

    is doing this? Have you tried it with other fonts?

    might be something wrong with my Open Type code, though if so I don''t know why
    it should work when going directly to the "all small caps" option in Open Type.
    I''ll ask them to check it out.  '

  body: "Bill \u2014 Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have CS 4 to check. Did you try a
    different font, as Christopher suggested? If the procedure works with another
    font, then I would suppose that the problem would indeed be with Wms Caslon, not
    the app.\r\n\r\nBut I took a quick peek under the hood and I don\u2019t see anything
    obviously wrong in the {smcp} and {c2sc} features. Works in CS 3 as expected.
    But this is not my bailiwick, so I can talk to MR and DJR about it when WmsC comes
    on deck (there\u2019s a few things in the queue ahead of it).\r\n\r\nCan you send
    me a PDF of a page with the problem in place, so I can be sure I\u2019m interpreting
    your description correctly?"

    caches helps?

  body: "@ William\r\n\r\nIf this would be a bug in Indesign CS4, it probably is already
    documented on Typophile, because it would be a fat bug.\r\n\r\nI often wonder,
    why the people here, that have problems with their fonts, don\u2019t destroy the
    outlines with one of the FontLab effect macros, remove the kerning and just post
    the vfb file, if the font is made with FontLab. And if it was made with a different
    program, the working files in the format of these programs would likewise ease
    the help."

  body: "So now I have tried to reproduce the problem, after deleting my former \"character
    style\". This time when I set it up, it worked correctly for my font, as well
    as Benton Sans Black, which has all small caps. So perhaps I made an incorrect
    choice in the dialogue box the first time. I don't know because I deleted the
    style, and can't check now.  \r\n\r\nHowever, when I continue to type after the
    affected characters, which theoretically should continue the same style, I do
    get the fake small caps again. And I was able to reproduce this apparent bug using
    Benton Sans Black.\r\n\r\nHere is an image with Williams Caslon:\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/all_small_caps_problem_6241.gif]\r\n\r\nOn
    the right most numbers, you see the original full size bold italic. The others,
    starting on the left are bold and bold italic, with the \"all small caps\" applied
    either directly or as a character style. Then I continued typing the same sequence
    after the formatted characters, and got the fake small caps. \r\n\r\nMy experience
    seems to be 1. a mistake I made in setting up the dialogue box, which I can't
    reproduce immediately. 2. Also some kind of bug in Indesign CS4, though I don't
    know exactly its dimensions.  "

  body: "Bill \u2014 Do a couple things for me, please. Go into your Preferences and
    under the Advanced Type change the Small Caps percentage. That should affect your
    fake small caps; does it?\r\n\r\nSecond, highlight one of those fake small caps
    (just a figure, because it looks like parens aren\u2019t being affected) and take
    a look at what\u2019s being applied.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that the OT menu will
    show that All Small Caps is applied. Does it indicate that the relevant Character
    style is applied and is there an override (+) next to the name? Does it happen
    to indicate that the Small Caps styling is also perhaps applied on top of the
    OT All Small Caps? That would be a bug and might yield what we\u2019re seeing.\r\n\r\nWill
    you see if you can reproduce this behavior with letters as well as numbers?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    can you ascertain whether it is your SC figs or default lining figs that are being
    reduced by the faux percentage? (By setting the numbers and manually changing
    the size by the percentage to see which matches.)\r\n\r\nNot sure what all these
    tests will tell us, but I\u2019m just trying to gather more info since I can\u2019t
    test this myself.\r\n"

  body: "Kent, nothing seems to affect those strange small figures, smaller than my
    small cap figures. I changed the preferences in Advanced Type, and it didn't affect
    them. Then I tried turning off the \"all small caps\" and it didn't affect them.
    They are labeled \"default figures\" in the open type menu, and even changing
    them to other figures doesn't do anything. The formatting seems stuck and locked.
    \r\n\r\nSince I was able to replicate this problem with Benton Sans, I'm pretty
    sure that it's not a problem with my font, which is the main thing I was concerned
    about. And I can work around it in InDesign. Right now I'm under deadline to get
    the book rewritten after copy editing, and also lay it out and set it, so I'd
    rather let this issue go for now, and let others worry about it.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help! \r\n\r\nps. I will just try shutting down my computer and seeing
    whether when restarted it is still a problem. Just to eliminate that it's coming
    from my computer being 'on' too long. "

    off the hook. It might be useful to understand what CS4 is doing, but I hear you
    about the deadlines. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll be curious to find out if rebooting clears
    anything. Who knows? \u2014 a corrupted resource or something.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise,

  body: "Ok, so I worked a little more on this. I rebooted, and opened up a new text
    box, in the same file, and both my font and Benton Sans works properly with the
    \"all small caps\" function. But in the old text box, the problems will happen
    as before. \r\n\r\nHere's the complication that didn't occur to me until now.
    This file was originally done on Abobe InDesign ME, as it has both Hebrew and
    English, and then was opened in CS4. --The book is a commentary on a Jewish classic,
    the Ethics of the Fathers, and I have the Hebrew there along with a translation
    (done with an Israeli) and my commentary. \r\n\r\nSome of the defaults buried
    in the text boxes are still InDesign ME defaults, and that is causing some weirdness
    here, I think.  \r\n\r\nI'm still using the Hebrew and English in the file and
    all is otherwise setting well. I have a feeling that this problem has arisen not
    because of either my font or InDesign CS4, but because of the importing of the
    original file from InDesign ME. \r\n\r\nI have a feeling this is not supported
    and probably not worth bothering about. I just hope no other weirdness pops up.\r\n\r\nI
    guess my only question at this point is whether I can scrub the file of weirdness
    from imported information, but I'm afraid that fixing what isn't otherwise broken
    is not smart.  \r\n\r\nThanks to all for helping me to trouble shoot this."
