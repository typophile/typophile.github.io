  body: These look all like near-matches to me. I think it  <BR>might be something
    by Rian Hughes or Factor Design.

  body: Yves, are you thinking of Rian&#39;s <a href="http://216.220.51.54/typepreview/typepreview.cfm?font=RegulatorBold&amp;size=48&amp;text=%28NO%29">Regulator</a>?
    The parenthesis don&#39;t match very well.

  body: I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s it, because the vertices on the N in <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FB00013303P1"
    target="_blank">&#39;Relay&#39;</a> from Font Bureau are clipped in the heavier
    weights. The parenteses are right though.
