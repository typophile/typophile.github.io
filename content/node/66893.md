body: "I've tangled with identifying this font before but at that time there was no
  Typophile to help. Hopefully this mystery can be cracked once and for all. This
  time its on a decal I'm remaking. Note the G is rounded on the outside corners but
  has straight corners inside. It also looks to have flat sides on all sides unlike
  the Eurostyle G. Very clean straight font. I'll post two examples. One is the original
  italic look and the other is a version I straightened in case it's a modified font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EngleMedium_5931.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/EngleMedium_4536.jpg]"

  body: Thanks for your help. Oxide looks really close. I'd have to modify it to condense
    it and then modify the G a little as well. I may just make it from scratch if
    no one has a match.
