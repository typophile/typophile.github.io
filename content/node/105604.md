  body: "Firstly thought it could have been harder, a big customization of some obscure
    techy freebie but I found [[http://www.dafont.com/miniskip.font|Miniskip]]. Just
    need to start with Miniskap (middle weight of Miniskip), tweak it a bit (/E crossbar
    terminal, /i dot) and job should be done.\r\nAlternative: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/aura|Aura
    T-26]]"
