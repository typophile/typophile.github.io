body: "Feedback please, cause I've been looking at this too long. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nI
  was asked to design a logo for an Seattle neighborhood blog to be called \"Around
  SODO\" - short for \"south of downtown\". It's a gritty urban hood known for a sports
  stadium, light industry & warehouses, Starbucks & Tully's HQ, light rail and freight
  rail, low-rent artists' studios, and a nightclub or two. \r\n\r\nI was going for
  an industrial yet eccentric, lively look. It's designed for screen resolution. I'm
  using grayscale so I won't be distracted by color at this stage. \r\n\r\nI have
  tried two stencil fonts for the letters SODO, one angular, one circular. I've tried
  angular and round fonts for \"around\" - lower case for informality. The graphics
  suggest travelin' around or city blocks, buildings, train tracks. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/around-sodo-logo-ideas1_4145.gif]"

    first two concepts work well for me.  Playing off the Around word is fun, but
    I stress that it must work with the architecture.\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\ndaniel"

  body: No disrespect, but I've got to mention that someone has misinformed you about
    the origin of the neighborhood name. SODO is short for "South of the Dome," not
    "South of Downtown." The name was contrived by boosters of the warehouse district
    south of the since-demolished Kingdome Stadium. Although Starbucks Headquarters
    is definitely within SODO, the Showbox Theater is in downtown Seattle right across
    the street from Pike Place Market, which is miles north of the SODO area.

  body: "processcamera,\r\nNo, there actually are two Showbox theaters. The one in
    SODO was opened in 2007, according to the link I provided.\r\n\r\nYou are right
    about the Dome, but since it doesn't exist anymore, \"south of downtown\" is now
    appropriate. "

  body: "I appreciate your clarification, dinazina. I didn't know a second Showbox
    had opened in 2007, plus the marquee photograph above is actually the downtown
    venue. Here's a photo I found of the sign lettering outside the funkier Showbox
    that's in the SODO neighborhood:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Showbox

  body: Okay, thanks for THAT clarification. Funny, the "X" right above SODO seems
    to subliminally suugest it might feature x-rated shows...
