  body: Two fonts that will get you closer, I think, are <a href='http://www.dafont.com/gourdie-cursive.font?text=ProDesigns&psize=l'
    target='_blank'>Gourdie Cursive</a> (a mix of the two fonts in the download) and
    <a href='http://www.fontspace.com/mouser-fonts/reynolds-chancery' target='_blank'>Reynolds
    Chancery</a>. Both fonts are from Mouser Fonts (Jerry Landers).

  body: I think Mike's choices are indeed closer than Poetica which is just too clean
    for this use.
