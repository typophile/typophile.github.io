  target=\"_blank\">Grotesque Bold</a> by Wooden Type Fonts and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/rama-gothic/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Rama Gothic Exp Heavy</a> by Flat-it, top suggestions by Find-My-Font,
  but it isn't either one.\r\n\r\nAny idea?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    one might work as a substitute.\r\nNo guarantee as to the legitimacy of these
    fonts. Some are based on rips of digital fonts created by other fontmakers, which
    are then eroded or otherwise abused. But there is some interesting original amateur
    work.\r\nDon"
