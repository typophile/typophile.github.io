  which were published by Kahnt in Leipzig in the early 20th Century. They have the
  following quite attractive hand-lettering and I wanted to see if I could fine some
  more examples, but am not quite sure the best way to search for them.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nHas
  anyone else come across a lot of lettering like this or does anyone know what this
  style might be called (or if anyone has digitalised them)?\r\n\r\n<img src=https://www.schubertiademusic.com/img/catalog-4/93/Mahler%206th%20title288.jpg

  body: "Thanks, that\u2019s really helpful. I should have realised that that was
    the style; it\u2019s the lack of ornamentation which threw me.\r\n\r\nI think
    Koloman Moser\u2019s lettering is most similar to the sample and is probably what
    interests me the most. It\u2019s somewhat less extrovert than Klimt\u2019s (e.g.
    the bars on the A are horizontal rather than at a 45-degree angle) which appeals
    to me."

  body: "Thanks for the further comments. I\u2019m not sure how well a straight digitalisation
    of this would work, since it\u2019s charm seems to be in the irregularity of the
    letters.\r\n\r\nI also like how the treatment of the accents changes depending
    on the size. Compare the \xFC in \u201CF\xFCr Grosses Orchestra\u201D to the \xFC
    and \xE4 in \u201CF\xFCr 4 H\xE4nde\u201D in the lower right text-block. Or the
    C in the large \u201CC F Kahnt\u201D with the smaller one in \u201CCopyright\u201D
    on the line below. "

  body: This looks vaguely similar to a monolinear style of writing developed by Austrian
    calligraphy Rudolph von Larisch. He was influential in the early twentieth century
    century. I don't know if von Larisch ever did anything in the mode of Jugendstil,
    but it seems possible that artists who studied von Larisch's technique might have
    translated it into this kind of Jugendstil lettering.

  body: "This was a very common lettering style at the beginning of the 20th century
    in Germany and Austria and numerous typefaces in this vein got issued from 1904
    onwards, e.g. Negrita by Genzsch & Heyse. You\u2019ll find this and lots of other
    examples in Taschen\u2019s \u201CA Visual History of Typefaces and Graphic Styles\u201D
    from page 74 onwards.\r\n\r\n"
