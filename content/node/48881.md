  as main area). And she wants a business card. I tried some designs, but I can't
  get anything good out of it. \r\n\r\nShe wants the font \"avant garde\" (gothic
  or somehting like that I think).\r\n\r\nAs she is a stand-alone consultant, she
  doesn't have a logotype - and I don't think that's necessery. Are these designs
  too plain? They aren't mine, but I was thinking something like that.\r\n\r\n"

    seem to have misplaced my Avant Garde!)"

  body: "Hhahaha. That was a really good one Theunis!!!\r\n\r\nBut I don't know, perhaps
    it's too sexistic. Most of her clients are having problems with the things you
    painted. =)"

  body: "Well okay ;-)\r\n\r\nI think your samples are <em>very</em> business-like.
    Well, they should, being from a bank.\r\n\r\nTry something with lots of white,
    and as thin a font as you can find. Nothing compressed -- keep it open and friendly.
    Add lots of tracking.\r\n\r\nDon't crowd the text. If you need to include lots
    of contact information (as the tiny print in your samples), try putting this on
    the back side, and keep the front side with your mom's name as clean and clear
    as possible.\r\n\r\nColoured text, rather than black, might work, but maybe you
    should steer clear from light blue (although I would associate it with dairy products).
    A pale red -- but not pink! -- conveys a 'human interest' (with a slightly feminine
    slant). Blue, green, purple, orange, brown and cyan do not. Pure, bright colors
    (red, green, cyan, hot pink) stand for 'intensity' and/or 'urgency', that you
    could do without."
