  in identifying this typeface. From what I understand it is of Bodoni origins but
  would be great to identify which designer and foundry created it.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nSimon"

    What's the source of the image you posted? Personally, I think it looks like an

    \ and total blackouts.\r\n - Herb"

    getting in contact with the original author but with no luck. I appreciate it's
    not to everyones taste and needs development but it sits nicely for a current
    logotype project."
