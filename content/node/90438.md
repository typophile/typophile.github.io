  to find symbols to represent certainty (knowledge, as in \u201Cwe know this for
  sure\u201D) and the opposite: uncertainty.\r\n\r\nExclamation mark / question mark
  is just a tad too obvious for this case."

  body: "Hmm. Yeah. Good ideas. I guess what I picture in my mind is a solid form,
    more of a logo like symbol because they need to stand out next to a headline.
    Example:\r\n\r\nX Know: Greenhouse gases are warming the planet.\r\n\r\nX Don\u2019t
    know: How far greenhouse gas levels will rise.\r\n\r\n(X = the symbol)\r\n\r\nThose
    mentioned could perhaps work knocked out of a circle or square, but wouldn\u2019t
    stand out enough as plain text."

    uncertainty, it seems what you need is a stick figure shrugging with palms up,

    little guy. His name is U+2368 Functional symbol tilde diaeresis. Looks mighty
    uncertain, no? And then you could have one with a straight \"mouth\" for certainty.\r\n\r\nOn
    second thought, emoticon-like symbols might really be too childish. But maybe
    losing the dots and just having a block/dash/minus, and a wiggly tilde-like thing,
    could work? Or maybe verticals would be better than horizontals, so you'd have
    a vertical bar and a wiggly vertical. That would actually slightly allude to the
    formal opposition between exclam and question, without being as literal."

  body: Aside from the question mark to indicate uncertainty, the only symbol I can
    think of that is specifically associated with the opposite is three dots arranged
    at the points of an upright equilateral triangle. That is used in mathematics
    to represent "Quod est demonstratum" - Q. E. D., this has been proved.

  body: "Probably not what you want, but:\r\n\r\nIn symbolic logic, an open square
    character usually means \"It's necessary that\", i.e. that what follows it is
    true no matter what--there is no possible situation in which it would be false.
    \ An open diamond (often just a rotated square) means \"It's possible that\" (in
    other words, that what follows it is something that is not <em>necessarily</em>
    false).\r\n\r\nIn addition, one uses the turnstile (a vertical line with a short
    horizontal line coming out of the middle of its right side) and double-turnstile
    (same thing, but with two horizontal lines very close to each other).  Turnstile
    and double-turnstile both mean, roughly, \"It is provable that\" as long as there
    is nothing immediately to their left.  So the turnstiles mean almost the same
    thing as \"It's necessary that\" in many contexts.  Sometimes they have slightly
    different meanings, but I doubt the distinction would matter for your purpose.
    \ (If there's something to the left of the turnstile, it means, roughly,that what
    follows is provable from or is justified by what precedes the turnstile.)\r\n\r\nYou
    can probably find examples of these in any font designed for typesetting math,
    e.g. in a default LaTeX setup."

    very subtle and strong at the same time (oxymoron?), something only a few of the
    smartest readers would pick up on it, but still \"graphical\" enough to work as
    a lead-in for the rest. Thanks anyway! \r\n\r\nI love these scarce moments when
    Typophile is all about obscure knowledge and true typohilia again, as opposed
    to the ID-my-font-or-do-my-homework direction it\u2019s usually going in nowadays."
