  that, I've been drawing type since I was a child and eventually grew up a little
  and became a graphic designer along the way. My hobby is now taking a serious turn
  as it's about time I tried to share and even sell my typeface designs. My first
  attempt was a hand drawn, all caps, neoclassical serif face that I named 'Carrig'.
  Carrig being the Irish word for 'rock' (I'm based in Ireland) and the typeface itself
  was strongly influenced by classic letterforms carved into stone and weathered by
  time.\r\n\r\nSo, now I am developing Carrig into a full family and here, with the
  Roman weight, I have drawn a full set of lowercase characters to suit the style
  of their uppercase parents.\r\n\r\nBefore I release this to the world, I would absolutely
  love some considered criticism (or praise!) so that I may improve it. As I am a
  novice, I am a little bit wary of making \"schoolboy errors\" and any advice anyone
  here can give will be greatly appreciated. And... as this is my first post, I promise
  to become involved with the community \u2013 if you'll have me :)\r\n\r\nYou can
  look at further examples on my website \u2013 [[http://paulogoode.com/carrig-roman-typeface|Carrig

  body: This is very good, charming and distinctive. The only thing I can really object
    to is the numeral 3, the upper half of which is stunted and lacking on all counts.
    The bowls of the numerals could generally stand more polishing for weight distribution.

    and /V look like they're leaning over to me, but that might be an intended part
    of the historical style you're aiming at."

    I know I have to rework my numerals, thanks for giving me confirmation. I'm equally
    happy that you appreciate the rest, cheers!\r\n\r\nThank you @Catharsis, before
    publishing this I had loosened the kerning on each individual letter as it was
    much tighter, I will view again. I can't see the leaning issue myself, but then
    again, I'm so close to this, it's hard to step back and be objective... hence
    coming here for opinions. I will check my axes once more. Thank you!"

  body: "I can corroborate that the right arm of /V /v /y appears to range farther
    than the left and leaves a lot of space under it. I recommend pulling the bottom
    a bit to the right and preserving the present width.\r\n\r\nA forward-balancing
    /S tends to work just fine in context and can be left to personal taste. That
    said, I hope you will consider re-creating the dollar sign independently, perhaps
    with different terminals as well."

    when advised to sign up here. I will take those points on board and yes, I was
    being lazy with the dollar symbol and I already have that down to be reworked.
    \r\n\r\nMy next question to anyone would be, is my font saleable? Is it too similar
    to another? I've been heavily influenced by Baskerville and the inscriptions from
    the Trajan column, is that obvious and therefore detrimental? Or do you see Carrig
    having its own merits and personality? \r\n\r\nI've made a conscious decision
    to avoid any straight lines in the letterforms (punctuation excepted) with the
    aim of giving  the typeface a natural warmth and friendliness... does that come
    across?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your considered opinions.\r\n\r\nPaulo"

  body: "You can say that again @Glider (sorry \u2013 it had to be said!). Fair comment
    about the x-height being big, that's been a deliberate decision because it's my
    first proper attempt at font creation and I'm designing via a combination of what
    I like and what feels intuitive. My original drawings (16 years ago) were calligraphic,
    hence the remnants of a hand drawn/unfinished style that you're picking up on
    and, as a strong influence, I've always loved how (some) Garamonds have an open
    /P bowl. I'm leaning towards keeping the /P and /R open to retain personality
    and differentiation, but will definitely look at joining the /Q.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    about open it too? I\u2019m thinking of a gap at the bottom of the circle, while
    the right part of the bowl joins the tail.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Carrig-Example-for-Typophile_3937_4652.jpg]\r\n(brutally
    ham-fisted chopping to illustrate the idea)\r\n\r\nBy the way, I very much like
    the flow of your |g| (though perhaps it could be very slightly wider at the bottom

  body: I think that's its big selling point, a generous x-height and classical warmth
    at the same time. People looking for both don't have a lot to choose from. I think
    this is because ever since ITC turned Garamond into plastic in 1975, everyone
    has been warning against doing that again, while laying all the blame on one attribute.

  body: I'm noticing the 8 is really bold. I know it's hard to mess with an 8's weight
    after you've gotten the curves just so, but set it among some lowercase and I
    think you'll see the need.
