  body: "That is incredible\r\n\r\nThis reminds me, on a much less sophisticated level,
    of how some grad students used type in the early days of computers (mid-1970s).
    This was in the geography department at the university I was attending. They wanted
    to make a map with light and dark shading to show the distribution of something
    (population density, maybe). The only thing the computer could print was ASCII
    characters, so they made the thing print using different glyphs for each zone.
    A \"light\" zone would use periods; a dark zone m's (m of course is quite dark
    in a monospaced font, which was all the computer had then); a mid-zone i's. With
    a bit of experimentation they had about five levels easily distinguished."

  body: The consistently brilliant folks over at Veer had several elaborate illustrations
    constructed out of type in recent catalogs, as I recall, but these works by Paul
    Smith are really humbling, I think. And uplifting at the same time. Ah, I love
    type.
