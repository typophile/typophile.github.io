body: "I'm designing a brochure which will be printed in both English and Russian.
  The client (an architect) is adamant that the text should be fully justified. It's
  not my preference, but I am willing to concede on some things to promote a happy
  working relationship.\r\n\r\nHowever, my extremely limited knowledge of setting
  Russian means I have no idea if \u2013 or where \u2013 one should break words with
  hyphens. I don't want a soggy lump of text full of rivers.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have
  any experience of this? Should I stick to my guns and insist on ragged right? I'd
  be interested to hear people's views."

    would be: Install the Russian dictionary and the computer will probably hyphenate
    correctly for you."

    may be the occasional mishap :-) But nothing dramatic a typesetter should or an
    editor shouldn't take care of.\r\nJust remember to set the language of that text
    to Russian."

    word is relatively long, so the absence of hyphenation is more likely to create
    readability problems.\r\n\r\nMikhail Leonov,\r\nSenior Software Design Engineer,
