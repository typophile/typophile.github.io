  body: "Other versions (ripoffs excluded) include the caps of <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/kudos-kaps-nf/'
    target='_blank'>Kudos Kaps Five NF</a>, which has no alternates and does not have
    your W, <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/brandegoris/' target='_blank'>Brandegoris</a>,
    which has lots of alternates - but still not your W - and, lastly, Dave Fabik's<a
    href='http://www.dafont.com/deroos-caps.font?text=Sunken+Well+tavern&back=author'
    target='_blank'>Deroos Caps</a>.\r\n\r\nBasically, with these four fonts, you
    get what you pay for in the mix of quality and character count."
