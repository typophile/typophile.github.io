<p>There are references to &ldquo;Allentown EMS,&rdquo; which, when EMS is set in small caps, seems inconsistent because Allentown is capitalized. The general rule I came up with to deal with this is to only put non-proper nouns in small caps.  So things like Allentown EMS are capitalized but where EMS appears by itself, it is in small caps.  If Allentown EMS is referred to as &ldquo;AEMS,&rdquo; that too is in full-height caps because it abbreviates a proper noun.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m having a PhD-like problem. The text is peppered with kHz and MHz. I&rsquo;m thinking of using the solution proposed <a href="http://typophile.com/node/33815#comment-202926">here</a>.</p>
<p>Does this sound reasonable to people?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say without seeing this in your actual setting, but I don&rsquo;t think things like this <em>need</em> to look «consistent» (because otherwise, the only sensible solution would be to just use the full caps for acronyms). I suspect you may be having a hangup that you don&rsquo;t need to have.</p>

<p>Hrant, you may have jumped the shark here. Your post may haunt you.</p>
<p>In tech writing, capital letters are all over the place in the middle of sentences: spec acronyms, company names, company acronyms, people names, descriptive letters after names, units of measure, etc.  And how do we  keep the reader from wanting to stop at the capital letters? Answer: we use a typeface that has small capital letters. This is the simple, clear solution.

<p>J. Tillman and Michael Boyer raise an interesting point. A font with a large x-height, and esp. one where full cps aren&rsquo;t as tall as the lower-case ascenders,  minimizes the difference between lower case and full cap letters (and full &amp; small caps). The only question is how well such fonts work with subscripts and superscripts. My initial guess is they can work just fine, but you&rsquo;d have to do a bit of testing to be sure.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but: Duh.
Also: As Michael indicates, Gentium&rsquo;s x-height isn&rsquo;t at all large.</p>
<p>What are we arguing about here?
I&rsquo;m saying that some conventions of technical typesetting are junk*,
and the careful addressing of how smallcaps should be working seems
to be overdue. It has probably never been done; people were probably
oblivious to typographic refinement (not the same thing as typographic
snobbery) and simply used TNR and whatever other junk was just
sitting there. Ben is trying to improve his/the situation, and he&rsquo;s doing
it in the best place possible - so let&rsquo;s be a bit lucid here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just as some conventions of type design.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, this is not a reply to any of your posts here, but I am going to quote you to define what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we arguing about here?&rdquo; Always a good question. The problem we&rsquo;re discussing is the one defined in the original poster&rsquo;s first sentence. &ldquo;I have some technical text with tons of abbreviations and initialisms.&rdquo; In the link in that same first post Florian Hardwig said: &ldquo;Recently it was my task to ‘calm down’ a text churned up by all-caps names, acronyms &amp; abbreviations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader&rsquo;s eye wants to stop when it gets to all these capital letters in the middle of the sentence. That&rsquo;s the problem. And in the internet age, we have all become technical writers and technical readers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;and the careful addressing of how smallcaps should be working seems to be overdue.&rdquo; Indeed. After reading numerous posts on small caps in technical writing, I conclude that the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; are very complicated. (If you are interested, check out  <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/84025">http://www.typophile.com/node/84025</a> where a bewildering number of options are offered, in the pdf, to be considered.) It seems that for ALL instances of capital letters in the middle of a sentence, the writer (or typesetter) should evaluate each one individually and make a decision:
-leave it as regular capital letters
-use small caps
-use small caps and lower case,as in the link in the original post
-use the bigger size small caps
-use the bigger size small caps and lower case
-try a number of typefaces and reevaluate all the options over and over
And if the typesetter goes through the book, thesis, or paper and makes a thoughtful decision for every instance of capital letters, is that a success? Do we need the 147 rules of small caps explained in the supplementary book to the Chicago Manual of Style? Or does the reader want a simple standard, that can easily be applied across multiple books in the universe, for easy-to-read technical material?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be kind to the reader. Let&rsquo;s be kind to the tech writers. Keep it simple and understandable. For technical writing, just use a typeface that has smaller-than-usual capital letters. Michel Boyer kindly demonstrated how effective it is. Forget about any small caps. (This is heresy in this forum, of course.) There are lots of fonts that meet this requirement, in addition to the ones Nina and I have suggested. Just do it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m actually a big fan of smallish (main) capital letters.
And I don&rsquo;t pretend everybody needs smallcaps all the time;
for one thing I don&rsquo;t believe smallcaps should come included
in (most) base fonts: most people will never use them, but
they&rsquo;re paying for them anyway. I&rsquo;d rather charge extra for
them to people who know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>There are however two important points you might be missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes caps actually need help standing out. <em>Especially</em>
in technical writing. This is because -unlike in something like a
novel- the reader often needs to [go back and] <em>scan</em> the text
for important words, and these words are quite often proper
nouns (ie capitalized).</li>
<li>Immersive reading is not about the reader making choices,
it&rsquo;s about the designer accomodating the human reading
mechanism that readers don&rsquo;t know about, and don&rsquo;t need to
know about. Readers are not &ldquo;confused&rdquo; by caps of different
sizes - they just read. But when caps are the wrong size (they <em>do</em>
need to vary depending on the contexts of density and meaning)
<em>then</em> they snap out of it, and pay for our avoidance of complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>So: You certainly don&rsquo;t encumber the reader&rsquo;s consciousness
with rules; but you do try to follow the quite complex &ldquo;rules&rdquo;
of how humans actually read (without them even realizing it).
Compare this to cars: engines are very complex, because they
need to be; but simplifying the usability for the driver is of
critical importance.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, regarding your two points&hellip;</p>
<p>If you want to capitalize a word, just do it. With a font that has smaller-than-usual capital letters it&rsquo;s not intrusive. You don&rsquo;t need small caps.</p>
<p>The reader wants to see small caps (or capital letters) used uniformly across different books. If the reader is looking at several different Python books, and small caps are used differently in each, it will be aggravating. You using small caps predictably in your book is not sufficient. Thus if the rules for small cap use are not clear, or if they are being made up on the spot by this forum or the writer, there is a problem. (&ldquo;and the careful addressing of how smallcaps should be working seems to be overdue.&quot;) And this is the case. Technical writers will be clearer (and less aggravating) to the reader by NOT making up their own rules, but just by using an appropriate typeface.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe a reader can, should or wants to
care to this extent. And this is exactly why [text]
typography is an under-the-radar sort of endeavor.</p>

<li>
<p>By that logic we should limit ourselves in all

<p>It does depend on the type of work.
But most scanning <em>is</em> for proper nouns.</p>

<p>I can buy this.</p>
<p>Snobbery:
In the microcosm of type design, the only thing I&rsquo;ve seen that can
be construed as snobbery is something I can actually be accused of:
seeing text fonts as superior to display fonts; I get flack for that
sometimes, but I stand by it. Besides that the only mildly offensive
thing I&rsquo;ve seen is better characterized as one-upmanship: &ldquo;My font
has 137 more contextual alts than yours!&rdquo; This is a problem Matthew
Carter once referred to: people are putting so many bells and whistles
into their fonts they don&rsquo;t spend the time thinking about the basics.
This might also be why people like Thomas Huot-Marchand are
complaining* that there&rsquo;s little real innovation in type these days.
We&rsquo;ll fix that this year&hellip;  :-)</p>
<ul>
<li>See Ruxandra Duru&rsquo;s recent paper:
<a href="http://www.eina.edu/arxius/docs_2/Duru_Ruxandra.pdf">http://www.eina.edu/arxius/docs_2/Duru_Ruxandra.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What snobbery do you see, specifically?
I&rsquo;d like to help you fight it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Times Roman was a pretty good font</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Metal Times with ink gain was/is indeed great. But my main
point above is that anybody who thinks it&rsquo;s a good idea to
use Times for everything (even within a given field) really
does not get visual communication. And by the same token we
need to not feel so constrained by what readers supposedly
mind so much that they can&rsquo;t handle any deviation from.</p>

for important words, and these words are quite often proper
nouns (ie capitalized).</p>
<p>And this raises the speculative question: How much would a typeface like Gentium interfere with scanning for proper nouns. There are two extreme views. 1. If the capital letters are smaller they&rsquo;re a lot harder to see, so of course there will be a heavy scanning hit. 2. Well, the initial capital letters may be smaller but they&rsquo;re still capital letters, which look different than lowercase letters, and they&rsquo;re higher than the lower case x-height; the reader knows what the letters look like and will still find them.</p>
<p>Would any speculators offer a gut reaction (brain reaction) as to which way you are leaning?</p>

When a student gives me a thesis to read, I ask for the pdf, preferably with hyperlinks for equations and references. I don&rsquo;t scan the paper, I search the pdf. More and more journals and even books are available in pdf format. So, for that market, I would not worry too much about proper names that are hard to find in a paper version.</div>

<p>I agree with you. Does that make me a snob?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m really after is the notion that design should play an instructional role in someone else&rsquo;s writing. Example: Rich Hendel had a student explain to him that he&rsquo;d chosen a sans at a small setting size for a work on Shakespeare &ldquo;to challenge the reader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dunno what Rich said to him; my reaction was &ldquo;if you want to challenge the reader, write your own damn piece. It&rsquo;s not your role to interject that challenge to an author&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The specifics of the goblet may change over time, but Warde got it about right.</p>
