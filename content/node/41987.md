  body: "So Linotype has a photo of Stanley M on their site. Shows how integrated
    the type biz has become.\r\n\r\nAbout 1990 I got an amazing bit of promo from
    Monotype. I wish I'd kept it. It shows an \"old-fashioned\" printing shop [excuse
    me: \"printing office\"]. You know, guys in neckties and sleeve garters at work
    at a platen press, a composing bank, and at a stone. Then in the background you
    can see a typesetting machine, maybe circa 1900. But the machine is a dang Linotype
    machine.\r\n\r\nThe clowns at Monotype's ad agency must have had no idea what
    a Monotype looked like. Nor, obviously, did the clowns within Monotype who ran
    the ad work have any idea what their own machines of not so many years before
    looked like.\r\n\r\nThis was back when Lino and Mono were still battling it out
    for the emerging \"desktop\" market, and each was trying to establish its heritage.
    An old typesetting machine meant \"heritage,\" I guess. Who cared what kind of
    machine.\r\n\r\npowers"
