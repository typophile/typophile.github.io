body: "Typophile, I wish you a new year to grow and educate in creativity.\r\nCreativity,
  the process of having original ideas that have value, is now as important in education
  as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.\r\n\r\nDear colleagues
  & friends, this year`s card is visible at :\r\nhttp://homes.ieu.edu.tr/~asegalini/bureau/2007_christmas_card.jpg\r\np.s.
  To view the last year`s card type \"2006\" in the URL.\r\n\r\nBest Whishes,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2007_christmas_card_5232.gif]"

    for so long been just about producing more and more graduates, I can't tell you
    how much I agree with you. \r\n\r\nMerry Christmas to you Alessandro."

  body: I always appreciate your sideways comments that seem designed to lead toward
    discovery rather than prescription. Looking forward to another year of the same.
