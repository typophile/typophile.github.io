    I'm thinking you might need some very constructed display font, dunno. Or maybe
    you could be quicker by making it yourself (like try making a \"P\" out of a \"B\"
    by just chopping off the bottom bowl &ndash; but it might not look that good).\r\nWhere
    are the font ID heroes hiding? :)"
