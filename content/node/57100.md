body: "Hi all,\r\nI haven't logged in in a long time, but would very much value your
  opinion on this logo. My client (and friend) are at an impasse when it comes to
  the name font used in this logo. The \"G\" component is fine, but my client would
  like to see his name bolder, which I am not necessarily opposed to, but he has given
  me a couple suggestions as to fonts he would like to use which I have given a strong
  opinion against. I'd like to hear what you think of what's there now, and what you
  think of any of his suggestions as well as any suggestions of your own. The font
  used now is (I hate to even say it) Helvetica Neue. Haha I know the most over used
  logo font out there. The fonts he has suggested are Verdana, Eurostyle, CopperPlate
  Gothic and Lucida Console. Any help would be much appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JPEG

  body: "My two cents:\r\n\r\n\"GOODWIN\" looks great, and I see no reason why you
    shouldn't use a heavier version of Helvetica or any other (Neo) Grotesk. \r\n\r\n\"exteriors\"
    tracked out and wide (streched?) needs work. Why not set it in the same width/spacing
    as the name, just smaller? I would also try to achieve equal colour on both lines,
    perhaps by using a slightly bolder weight for \"exteriors\"."

  body: god forbid! it's not stretched, just the extended version of the font, but
    it is tracked wide.

  body: he's now leaning towards Bell Gothic Black, any thoughts? He likes the serifs
    on the I and G but I find them a bit off balance.

  body: I can see what you mean by how it looks set in Bell Gothic. I actually tried
    it in Gill Sans Black and think it looks pretty good, much better balance at least.

  body: Gills Sans is nice, but it doesn't have the slab serif on the I, he's seems
    very particular about that
