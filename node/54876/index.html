  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>To me, bad typography is typography that does a poor job of conveying the message that the designer wishes to convey.  In general, good typography follows certain rules, pertaining to size, style, and format.  Generally good typography is easily readable and accomplishes its goal.  When asked to find some examples of bad typography, I thought what better place to look then Google.  Man did I find some.  It is amazing what horrible design decisions have been made for public signs!</p>

This first one is probably the least offensive of the four that I found.  I mean, the school name and sign is still readable, it&rsquo;s just that the curvature of the words makes it a little more difficult to make out.  Also the curvature makes the spacing between letters a little funky, so probably not the best typographic decision in the world.</p>

This next one is just weird.  I really thought it said &ldquo;Lilly&rsquo;s Horal&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Lilly&rsquo;s Floral&rdquo; at first.  The way that the semi-cursive letters run into each other makes it hard to read and just weird to look at.  This totally breaks the rule of adequate spacing between letters.  Was the designer blind when he/she designed this sign?  All I can say is that I would never want this type of sign representing my business.</p>

This third picture is also kind of amusing.  I guess the font itself isn&rsquo;t that bad, (I mean, it could be worse), but the vertical baseline of the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; really doesn&rsquo;t work here.  First of all, the letters run together and look like the stacked capitals &ldquo;WTF&rdquo; which is pretty funny all in itself.  However, when you look at it closer, you realize that it is supposed to read sideways &ldquo;THE.&rdquo;  The problem is that at first glance a viewer sees &ldquo;WTF MAC STORE,&rdquo; when it should really say &ldquo;THE MAC STORE.&rdquo;  Personally, I find this a very big mistake by the designer responsible for this sign.</p>

I personally think this last one speaks for itself.  Spacing problem maybe??  LOL!</p>
