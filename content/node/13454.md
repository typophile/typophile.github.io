  body: "Thank you very much for the scan, Shu. That should work nicely.\r\n\r\nWith
    this much better view, it looks as if someone simply drew it with a mono-width
    (mostly) tool and left it as is. The result is completely inconsistent in the
    details, but, to me, wonderfully consistent as a whole.\r\n\r\nIs any relevant
    info given (foundry, designer, date)?"
