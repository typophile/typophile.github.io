  useless here. The organization has no high-res or vector copies, according to my
  contacts, nor any idea of what the font might be.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching both the
  logo itself and my attempt at separating the letters out for, hopefully, easier
  ID-ing."

  body: "As you note, this is a very similar to University Roman.\r\nIt originated
    in Stunt Roman, a lettering design drawn by Ross F. George in the late 1920s with
    the Speedball pen and published in the Speedball books. The most extreme features
    were modified over the years and this is how it looked by the mid 1950s:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Speedball17StuntRoman@50_4190.jpg]\r\nDigital
    versions have been made by Letterhead Fonts, as Speed Roman, and by Nick Curtis,
    as Hacky Sack NF, but neither is as close as the 1950s lettered version.\r\nThere
    was also a version by by Robert Trogman for Photolettering, called Celtic, that
    was almost identical to the 1950s lettered version, but it has not been digitized.\r\nA
    more conventional version of Stunt Roman was produced by Philip Kelly with Mike
    Danes at Letraset in 1972 and distributed as University Roman. Digital versions
    from  Letraset, ITC, Adobe and others.\r\nTake your pick as to which version fits
    your needs.\r\nDon\r\n"
