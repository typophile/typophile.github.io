body: "I am looking for a name of this particular newspaper typeface (and closest
  digital version). The attached sample is from Aberdeen Journal, but most other UK
  papers (Western Mail, Manchester Guardian, Caledonian Mercury, Daily News, etc)
  used identical typefaces.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aberdeen_Journal_1900_4642.jpg]\r\n\r\ncheers,

    above mentioned. As of what typeface it is set in, sorry that is beyond my skill.
    All experts here will probably know.
