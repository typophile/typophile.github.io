  body: "Each of the repeated letters 'i' and 'e' are different. That usually means
    that it is not a font, but hand-drawn. \r\n\r\nThis style is similar to a number
    of popular new script fonts like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emily-lime/bombshell-pro/?refby=bowfin|Bombshell
    Pro]] from Emily Lime. The foundry has several others with a similar feel. Also
    Eurotypo, and Trial by Cupcakes (see [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/trial-by-cupcakes/anna-clara/?refby=bowfin|Anna
    Clara]]).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
