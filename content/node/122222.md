  body: "The Walbaum I recognized right away, but the sans was proving impossible
    to ID.\r\n\r\nUntil, that is, I located a PDF of the bulletin online. If you open
    the PDF and go to File > Properties > Fonts, it lists all the used typefaces.
    Pleasantly surprised that I picked the right version of Walbaum (Monotype). Thanks
    for introducing me to Clearview...."
