body: "hey everyone,\r\n\r\ni just purchased Graphic Design The New Basics by Ellen
  Lupton and Jeffifer Cole Phillips and can't figure out what typeface is used for
  the cover, and then throughout the book.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling that Univers is
  what is used in the book, at least for the text copy, but i'm not 100% sure.\r\n\r\nsample
  can be found [[http://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Design-Basics-Ellen-Lupton/dp/1568987021/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product|here]].\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: The cover looks like <a href=http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013>Knockout</a>,
    but the inside text looks like something else.

    the inside I believe it's Univers used.\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: The book's colophon (page 247, below the list of student contributors) identifies
    the cover typeface as Knockout and the rest of the book as Univers.
