  body: "Hi Dan\r\n\r\nWell there is <a/href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1490/spartan-family.html\">Linotype
    Spartan LT,</a> which has what you might call a regular question mark, like the
    one in the sample on ebay.\r\n\r\nYou might also have a look at <a/href=\"http://www.linotype.com/308/dinneuzeitgrotesk-family.html\">Neuzeit
    Grotesk Light.</a>\r\n\r\nThere again it depends on what you mean by 'nice'; as
    it says in the full font name for Spartan this is a face designed for classified
    advertising at about 5pt. In other words its a bit like Bell Gothic in terms of
    its initial design function. Consequently all of the Spartan letterforms look
    really distorted when compared to the Futura model it was taken from. \r\n\r\nYou
    could look at R. H. Middleton's Ludlow Tempo or Gerald Giampa's revival of <a/href=\"http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/twentiethcen.html\">Lanston
    Monotype Twentieth Century.</a>\r\n \r\nIMHO, the idiosyncracy of the question
    mark in Futura is a small price to pay for the correct proportions of the rest
    of the face... especially in the capitals.\r\n\r\nIf you think the question mark
    is that bad you could always have a go at drawing your own."
