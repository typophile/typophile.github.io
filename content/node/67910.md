body: "I\u2019m a student at Pratt Institute working on my Senior thesis project.
  The main part of my project is a blog meant to start discussion between those interested
  in typography and those interested in graffiti. It is still in its early stages,
  however, I am attempting to get visitors to comment on the posts. My hope is that
  the site will start conversations between visitors around the topics and ideas I
  discuss. I\u2019m also conducting brief email interviews on my topic, so if anyone
  would be interested in answering a few questions please let me know. The blog is
  at [[http://allcityorphan.wordpress.com/]]"
