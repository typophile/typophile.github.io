  &#43;0000 &#40;GMT&#41; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.ukpoint.biz/jkhkj/1000/" target="_blank">Get
  your business logo in an hour!</a> <BR> <BR>Do you need a logo for your company,
  website, or event? Then you&#39;ve already talked to several design firms that asked
  you from $500 to $2000 for 3-5 mockups, and promised to have your logo done in a
  month or two. But why spend a lot of time and money on a logo you may not finally
  like at all, just because it is custom? <BR> <BR>Now you have an opportunity to
  have a great logo that you really like in just a few minutes, risk-free, and at
  unbeatable price. Swift Logos offers pre-made logo designs that allow you to create
  your own custom logos without having to hire an expensive design studio. <BR> <BR>You
  can choose the logo you like most from hundreds of great pre-made logos created
  by our professional designers, and instantly receive it in editable Adobe Illustrator
  and Corel Draw files. Write in your company name and slogan, and in no time you
  will be able to use it for your company letterheads, brochures, website, and other
  marketing materials. Do it yourself or have us customize it to fit your needs. <BR>

    art in standard AI, Corel formats. <BR> <BR>So the business plan is related to
    stock imagery, with varying levels of licensing/exclusivity. <BR> <BR>However,
    there would certainly be copyright issues down the road if two separate businesses
    licensed the same image from Switf and thought they had made sufficient changes
    to it qualify for a unique copyright. <BR> <BR>And of course, the font police
    should be alerted: <BR> <BR>&#34;Please remember to intall the font prior to attempting
    to edit the logo. You can use any font you choose but for your convenience, we
    supply you with the font that we use in the sample.&#34; <BR>'

    most valuable tools a company has. <BR> <BR>If someone thinks they can get the
    right image for there business from stock logo art and for such a low price then
    I would imagine that there business has little chance of succeeding. <BR> <BR>Serious

    <BR>I&#39;m pretty sure this would have won the judges over. <BR>I have to say
    the sample was very easy to use. <BR>And I now have a pirated copy of Square 721
    Bold Extended BT! <BR> <BR>Schwing! <BR> <BR>Tanya. No, no, no. &#60;i&#62;Actually&#60;/i&#62;
    that&#39;s a miniature version of a Miss Saigon poster, with a decapitated granny
    holding a longboard. But you are correct. Those are in fact small white birds
    stapled to the poster.
