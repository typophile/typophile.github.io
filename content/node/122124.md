  utility under Windows 7 Pro x32 on another machine. Whenever I try to use this utility,
  system brings up Windows Installer with an error message that says:\r\n\"Windows
  Installer is looking for, but can't find:\r\nMicrosoft Opentype Font File Properties
  Extension.msi\"\r\n\r\n... and gives a browse function for this installer file.\r\n\r\nThis
  utility works fine if I select the \"cancel\" button on Installer window, however.\r\n\r\nI've
  tried removing this utility to reinstall it, but I get the same error message. Could
  anyone shed some light on what the problem could be?\r\n\r\nAlso, will this utility
  run under Windows 7 Pro x64?\r\n"
