  body: "AS much as we may surround our selves with cement, plastic and glass, we
    are no less a part of nature than anything else on earth. You can't really step
    out of nature, so what's your definition of nature? Where do you draw the line.\r\n\r\nMy
    point: perhaps you could look at old signage - rusting, pealing, crumbling, covered
    in lichen, mould - Home to birds. Going back to nature.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"
