  a Blackletter influence, but I found the overall minimalistic and nostalgic design
  great. Often a contradiction \u2013 I find \u2013 and here these ideas work in harmony.
  \r\n\r\nI personally loved the package, hope this is interesting to some.\r\n\r\n<img

  the helpers of Father Frost, the Russian Santa Claus. "

    is still operational and back in gold communist days it was easily identifiable
    by a very strong vanilla smell that drifted in the air around it. You would drive
    toward the airport outside of Moscow and would literally smell the factory several
    blocks away.\r\n\r\nThe smallcaps say \"Milk Chocolate\"."

    nice. The company is the biggest Belarusian \r\nchocolate producer. Given that
    for many in Belarus the Soviet \r\nUnion as a \u201CGolden Age\u201D is the point
    of reference for a national \r\nidentity, it does not surprise me that a simple

  body: "After some research I think you are all right. \r\n\r\nFirstly the holiday
    season special design is supposed to represent [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snegurochka|\u0421\u043D\u0435\u0433\u0443\u0440\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0430/Snegurochka
    - the Snow Maiden]]. So this is just traditional folklore. The shape of the ornament
    is most likely supposed to be a traditional russian headwear called \u043A\u043E\u043A\u043E\u0448\u043D\u0438\u043A/Kokoshnik,
    as one can see it here on the [[http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA_(%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80)|Russian]]
    or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoshnik|English]] Wikipedia page\r\n\r\nThere
    are plenty of interpretations of Snegurochka wearing such a hat:\r\n[[http://www.google.ru/search?um=1&hl=ru&newwindow=1&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=c_APT53MK4ahOvvU3IAF&ved=0CDsQBSgA&q=%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B3%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0+%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA&spell=1&biw=1280&bih=710|\u0421\u043D\u0435\u0433\u0443\u0440\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0430
    \u043A\u043E\u043A\u043E\u0448\u043D\u0438\u043A on Google.ru.]]\r\n\r\nSo mainly
    it is just folklore and most likely does not really have an distinct ideological
    flavor to Russians! \r\n\r\nAs the Snow Maiden is one of the main New Year/Christmas/Winter
    figures in folklore the design elements are probably supposed to evoke mainly
    the association with snow crystals. However the ambiguity might or may not be
    intentional, one can not say. There is an Orthodox Christian element in the design
    as well. This is due to the Kokoshnik. As the headpiece is inspired by an architectural
    element of Russian churches from the 16th and 17th century, which even has the
    same name: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoshnik_(architecture)|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoshnik_(architecture)]].\r\n\r\nTalking
    about propaganda is probably way too strong, as it is just culturally embedded
    knowledge which of course has impact on belief-systems, but to somebody in a mainstream
    culture it is perceived as neutral! Therefore the designer might have just made
    use of folklore for the sake of nostalgia, as for the mainstream there probably
    is no ideological flavor to it. One can only speculate, if the choice to draw
    on folklore with Christian roots was a conscious choice or not. \r\n\r\nBtw, this
    is how the back looks like:\r\n<img src=\"http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/5003/chocback0012.jpg\">\r\n\r\nIt
    reads on the back that it is available in NY - Brooklyn at Desly.com 242 47th
    Street, 11220 NY. Tastes a bit like a mix between general European backing chocolate
    and milk chocolate. I posted the NY address just if somebody were interested in
    a very out of the ordinary way. ;)"
