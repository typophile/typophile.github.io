<p>When Eye magazine printed a review of Gunnar Swanson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Graphic Design &amp; Reading&rdquo;, I went to get a copy from the local Borders. The register guy said &ldquo;you know this magazine costs $28?&rdquo; Which of course provided the perfect excuse for my suave-act reply: &ldquo;Yeah, but I have to buy it - I&rsquo;m in it&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Overall, the article is just that, and I think John&rsquo;s &lsquo;moronic&rsquo; is way too harsh. It does give the idea that an interest in fonts can be quite enjoyable, which is great.</p>
<p>But these sentences were for me bad journalism:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Graphic designers, who often have fonts to sell, can be cranky about where their p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s come from, and they seem to be getting crankier by the minute. Maybe it&rsquo;s because there is less and less demand for original typefaces;&rdquo;</p>
<p>First, I would think that actually a very small percentage of graphic designers produce and sell fonts. Second, if the demand for original typefaces was falling off I think I would have heard about it on Typophile. My impression is the opposite.</p>
<p>The tone of &lsquo;oh those whacky people&rsquo; is standard journalistic fare, and not a serious issue, though I think it is shallow. Someone at the New York Times who makes claims about the type business should really feel a need to check their facts, which she obviously didn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey everybody - maybe the article was a bit of fluff, but then again you don&rsquo;t often see articles on type or fonts in major newspapers, and nice to see Mark S get a plug. I read it online every day for many reasons, and certainly when Paul Krugman does an op-ed piece, usually describing the end of Western Civilization as we know it, under the current admininstration, but this is for another comment area. Oh, by the way, Barbara Kruger and her trademark style, knock out Futura Bold Italic on red, are just about everywhere, including in places like &ldquo;Real Simple&rdquo; magazine, and just about anywhere else.

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>&hellip;maybe the article was a bit of fluff, but then again you don’t often see articles on type or fonts in major newspapers&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Just as well, considering their usual quality, lack of precision and focus on the goofy and irrelevant (ban Comic Sans? yawn &ndash; it isn&rsquo;t even fresh filler). Most journalism is increasingly characterised by functional ignorance of the topics being reported on, supplemented by hasty Internet research &ndash; the result of hiring journalism school graduates instead of writers, I suspect &ndash;; journalism about type seems particularly embarassing to me, but maybe people in other professions feel the same way about coverage of their own fields. Having been dumbed-down in &lsquo;quotes&rsquo; by a number of journalists over the years, I think I&rsquo;m entitled to be harsh.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>My wife is an economist, and in economics the term of contempt for an article that is substandard is &ldquo;journalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I just recently talked to a fine journalist who has covered one industry for much of his career, and he says he regularly has to explain to serious people that he is not like what they see on TV - he actually understands what he writes about. He thinks the big problem is that journalism school is the worst preparation for journalism, because you come out being ignorant of every subject.</p>
<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if as a rule journalists had humility and were willing to learn, and wanted to learn.</p>
<p>This particular article is such a relatively mild and harmless example of the problem that I can&rsquo;t see getting too worked up about it; the phenomenon generally is a really grave problem,</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Congratulations to Mark, but the basic message of the article was summed up by her use of &ldquo;font wonks&rdquo; to dismiss every opinion in the article as essentially irrelevant.</p>
<p>I am always please to see any coverage of font design in the Times (and the Times is still the best US paper I know of hands down &ndash; maybe not saying much as Hrant put it) but while they currently have a light but serious article on the furniture fair and cover home design well and often, they have always managed to dismiss font designers as essentially nerds.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have to agree with John Hudson. Moronic is an apt description. It reads like a high school paper—poorly researched, not well thought out, and hastily written.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>It is good to see Mark&rsquo;s article referenced. Maybe people will read it and maybe even think about it. Maybe.</p>
