  has lost its meaning. Usually this is a sweet, endearing gesture on the part of
  a family member to rekindle family ties or pride.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not do a lot of
  this type of work, primarily I deal directly with type.  But, my clients are smart,
  articulate and inquisitive people so their wishes usually interest me.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Crest_4813.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  crest is from a client planning her wedding.  It is the icon for women in her family\u2014\"loosely
  the meaning is [that] Kelly females [are like] busy bees [we] make [the] best honey...\r\n\r\n\r\n...Or,
  Irish women pick the best men, do the best work, and raise the best children.  or
  something like that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crest and heraldic \"thing\" is not my bailiwick,
  but I do get a kick out of working with some arcane piece of iconography. To my
  surprise, we Americans have gone in for this sort of thing for a long time, making-up
  crests and heraldic devices for our own mongrel, North American clans.  (My client
  has no clue what the initials underneath the behive mean, if anyone knows the knowledge
  would be much appreciated!)\r\n\r\nThis is a copy of my client's aunt's wedding
  invitation, the family crest is blind embossed on it. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kelly_Invite_3679.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  invitation is french-folded and the text commercially engravied.  This means that
  the letters were drawn by hand onto an engraving plate or die, the drawing being
  mediated by a pantograph machine.  Frederick Goudy, great American typographer,
  believed in the good virtues of the pantograph. But many typographers think it sounded
  the death-nell for type. It is interesting to note that this is also true for the
  popularization of the pantograph machine in stationery. In the stationer trade,
  it is said that the \"Masterplate\" system, manufactured and marketed by the Cronite
  company, single handedly destroyed the hand engraved social stationery industry.\r\n\r\nThe
  pantograph style of this invitation is Lucerne.  In the trade we refer to it as
  Gothic. Nomenclature for lettering styles in the stationery trade is not the same
  as typography or other industries where lettering is used.  In commercial American
  engraving, Lucerne is an \"in-line\" example, which refers to the many strokes (or
  cross-hatchings) that make up the shading of the letters. For the gun trade, this
  articulation of tone is called \"shaded\" as in the Shaded Roman style so popular
  on \"London Best Guns\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lucerne_UC_5224.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  is a close-up of the Lucerne style from this invitation. Such fancy types are generally
  used for formal occasions and announcements, like weddings. When reviewing any type,
  it is important to remember that pre-fabricated letterforms of any kind were originally
  made to look like the hand drawn originals laboriously created by scribes prior
  to the invention of moveable type. So, it is quite natural that many lettering styles,
  especially the formal, fancy ones would replicate the intricate, ornate decoration
  of Fraktur or Black Letter from around the same time as Gutenberg's invention (moveable
  type)."
