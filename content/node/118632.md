  would be perfect for a project on which I'm currently working. Does anyone here
  by chance know?\r\n\r\nhttps://creativemarket.com/brand\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/creative

    I can't find the thread.\r\n\r\nIf memory serves, the script was custom calligraphy.\r\n\r\nI
    don't remember if the sans was identified, but Alright Sans Bold is close for
    Market (though the a is too narrow):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/okay-type/alright-sans/bold/"

    for the thread, but likewise couldn't find it. Glad to feel like not such a dunce.
    ;)\r\n\r\nThanks for the heads-up on Alright Sans. I'll have to keep that one
    in mind - it's lovely! But in this case, you're right - it's very close but not
    quite right. The angle of the legs on the \"R\" and \"K\" are a bit different
    as well.\r\n\r\nThank you, thank you, thank you!\r\n"
