    this. I'm not sure how I feel about it; it seems like there's not very much substance
    and that you don't really start your rhetoric until the last slide, so your argument
    is not very strong. Otherwise, though, it's always interesting to hear about what
    goes in to certain typefaces directly from the designer, so I appreciate your
    posting this."

    to market software at novice users and the Home market (NOT the normal business
    customers that most software was being made for). \r\n\r\np.s. The Dark Knight
    has fixed his problem."

    notes open. \r\n\r\nThe overall talk is about showing that Microsoft was making
    software for home computers in every house and made a Consumer division ('93).
    Software was made not for designers, businessmen but novice common people. Common
    people love it. Designers hate it but it wasn't made for them it was made for
    dummies.\r\n\r\nvincent\r\n"

  body: "Vince, I was reading the notes. What I'm saying is that your argument (from
    what I gather \u2014 not trying to set up a straw man) is that Comic Sans somehow
    reflects what design is all about, because it reflects what the consumer wants.
    I'd really like to see that argument developed further, particularly the idea
    that design is about reflecting what the greater public wants."
