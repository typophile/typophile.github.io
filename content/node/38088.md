  by the European Union. The argument is about the European Central Bank\u2019s preference
  for EYPO in Cyrillic, which does not match the Cyrillic spelling of \u201CEurope\u201D
  in Bulgarian and Russian either. \u2013 Bulgaria is the only state within the EU
  which uses Cyrillic. (See more about [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=1&idart=135|in

    EU. If others join should the Bulgarian spelling be the only one used on the bank
    notes? Or should additional spellings be used too? \r\n\r\nCyrillic is a bit dull
    - I'm waiting to see Arabic be required to support \"European\" languages."

    across it google investigating a matter).\r\n\r\nBut Banknotes are uniform, and
    in the Latin script a unification of spelling has been adopted on the banknotes
    as well. While in documents the Euro is referred to as euro, euras, eur\xF3 depending
    on language (and some others), on the banknotes it only appears in the \"euro\"
    spelling.\r\n\r\nSo a unification within the cyrillic has a precedent. What should
    not happen, however, is, if all cyrillic countries were to use \u0415\u0412\u0420\u041E,
    \u0415\u0423\u0420\u041E (a mere transliteration of EURO) should not be considered.\r\n\r\n"

    \u0415\u040E\u0420\u0410 \r\nBulgarian: \u0415\u0412\u0420\u041E\r\nMacedonian:

    \u0404\u0412\u0420\u041E, \u0415\u0412\u0420\u041E\r\n\r\nFrom the article: \"In
    standard literary Ukrainian 'euro' is spelt \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043E ('evro'),
    although Russian-influenced \u0454\u0432\u0440\u043E (pronounced 'yevro') is also
    possible and more common in large cities across the country, South-Eastern areas,
    and among Russophones.\"\r\n\r\nBelarusian is the odd one out, it seems. I think
    the Belarusian pronunciation is basically the same as the pronunciation used by
    at least some Russian speakers, but the difference is that Belarusian uses phonetic
    spelling. It's as if some hypothetical quasi-anglophone language with phonetic
    spelling used \"yooro\" for euro."

    clearly.\r\n\r\nWhat I had in mind is the fact that some Russian dialects used
    the pronunciation [w] for \u0432 in certain positions instead of the more standard
    [v]. Refer to <a href=\"http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map15.html\">this page</a>
