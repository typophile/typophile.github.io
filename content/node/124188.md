  tirelessly. I tried what the font and I ask numerous graphic designer but we've
  seem to hit a dead end.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows where or how to find this font I
  would greatly appreciate your help! Notice that the capital 'A' and 'G' are so special.\r\n\r\nThank
  you[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot 2015-03-24 at 13_3675_5430.38.50.png]"

    or was created using an electric typewriter.\r\n\r\nThe typeface may not have
    a digital equivalent.\r\n\r\nA much larger sample would aid the search (letters
    need to be at least 100 px tall and scanned at a decent resolution to run through
    visual database searches).\r\n\r\nThe type used elsewhere on this cover (not shown
    in your sample) is set in Kabel and Helvetica, but neither is a match to the track
    list and credits...."

  body: "In 1981 the record industry was a long established user of photo type products
    which were used to distort typefaces to compress or expand width, height and other
    features.\r\nMy impression of the image -- here enhanced to facilitate visual
    examination [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SansWideDreams1981Typophile124188_3643.jpg]
    is that this is a font that has not been digitized, which was applied in an expanded
    width version. There is also a possibility that it was a typeface for a an electric
    typewriter of the era, but the record industry was not noted for typewritten album
    covers. Also, very few typewriters could produce proportional spacing.\r\nIn any
    case, It is not possible to duplicate it exactly with a digital font, but there
    are some digital fonts that correspond to most of the letter forms. \r\nAfter
    looking at quite a few I settled on a font by Tobias Frere-Jones, which is being
    sold by Font Bureau as Poynter Gothic Text http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/PoynterGothicText/styles/\r\nHere
    it is, used to display some of the album text [img:sites/default/files/old-images/PoynterGothicTextAsDREAMS_5869.jpg]\r\nHere
    it is, stretched horizontally 120%, and used to display the same text \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PoynterGothicTextwidth120pctAsDREAMS_5707.jpg]\r\nMost
    people would not notice any difference.\r\nPerfectionists could edit _A_ to have
    a broad flat top and _G_ to have a closer fit on the crossbar and spur and tinker
    with other letters to suit their taste.\r\nDon"
