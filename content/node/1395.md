    the uc U &amp; T shouldn&#39;t be a bit wider, and  <BR>there are weight problems
    top and bottom of the uc G. <BR>The uc C seems to be leaning too much to the right.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not so keen on the style of the leg of the uc R  <BR>&#40;that&#39;s
    personal though&#41; but it does seem to be  <BR>floating above the baseline,
    so you might want to  <BR>optically correct that and have it end a bit lower.

    of your lowercase &#34;round&#34; characters are very nice, but the &#34;diagonal&#34;
    ones &#40;vwxyz&#41; are not following the style. <BR>And your uppercase letters
    are too &#34;conservative&#34; &#40;see, for example, your &#34;E&#34;, &#34;F&#34;
    and &#34;T&#34;&#41;. Try applying the asymmetrical serif to the uppercase too,
    and making them wider. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a good start anyway. <BR>Good luck! :-&#41;

  body: The asymetrical serif idea is rather interesting - I have  <BR>recently been
    working with Eplica and that has some <BR>&#40;seemingly&#41; extreme serif detailing.
    But once set at  <BR>&#39;normal&#39; reading sizes they are quite harmless. What  <BR>am
    I trying to say? Try to judge it at the sizes you intend  <BR>it to be used at.  <BR>
    <BR>The lc t,v,w,x,z seem to be a little out of place. All the  <BR>rest of the
    glyphs possess fairly organic traits, whereas <BR>these seem to be too &#34;sharp&#34;

    the &#34;negative space&#34; stuff&#41;, and great support material &#40;like
    the classification and glossary&#41;. Very serious effort. <BR> <BR>In trying
    to figure out if you&#39;ve hit the mark in balancing your design for the intended
    size usage, the primary factors are: vertical proportions; color; and spacing.
    Each has to make sense in the context of the others. A good &#34;bad example&#34;
    is Mrs Eaves: x-height is ideal for large setting, color is ideal for midrange
    setting, and spacing is ideal for small setting: three-way mismatch. Chucara is
    balanced much better, but I&#39;d say that: <BR>- The &#34;text&#34; cut is a
    bit loose. <BR>- The &#34;small&#34; cut is a bit light. <BR> <BR>On the other

  body: 'Thanks! <BR>But I&#39;m still confused: it seems to me that the first two
    columns are set at the same size with different leading, and the last two columns
    are set another size &#40;but the same between them&#41; and different leading.
    Am I going blind? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Juan Pablo, I took a close look at your
    page 21, and I&#39;m seeing a classic problem that shows up in efforts to compare
    economy. <BR> <BR>Given a set of fonts &#40;and a given setwidth&#41;, the two
    factors you can control are point size and leading &#40;tracking is bad&#41;.
    The results you&#39;re looking for are a balance of readability and economy &#40;and
    not simply a total preservation of the former at maximal economy&#41;. Readability
    is of course nearly impossible to measure &#40;while economy is very easy&#41;,
    so it&#39;s best to match the various settings in outward appearance &#40;very
    different than true functionality&#41;, see which ones are how economical, and
    try to subjectively balance that against an informal evaluation of readability.
    &#40;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m explaining this well...&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, the
    tricky technical part is making the outward appearance consistent across the different
    fonts. We already know that apparent size is what counts and not point size, but
    there&#39;s also the issue of apparent <i>leading</i>. A reader&#39;s &#34;appreciation&#34;
    of a setting is firstly based on how big the type is, but secondly also based
    on the ease of doing a return from the end of one line to the beginning of the
    next - and this depends on apparent leading. <BR> <BR>So for example let&#39;s
    look at the middle four columns &#40;page 21&#41;, ignoring Chucara Text and Bell
    Centennial.The apparent size between them is mostly fine &#40;just Clifford is
    smallish&#41;, except for Times, which is much smaller. But the apparent leading
    is way off: Chucara Small has very little, then there&#39;s a gap toClifford,
    a bigger gap to Celeste, and then bigger one to Times. So I think you have to
    play with the point/leading of each to get them to really match in outward appearance,
    <i>then</i> you can really compare economy versus readability. <BR> <BR>It gets
    even trickier afterwards though! Once you have those matched, you need to feel
    your way between what appears more readable &#40;while in fact that&#39;s <i>legibility</i>&#41;
    versus what is in fact more readable. For example, Clifford has a smaller x-height
    than Chucara, which means it has longer extenders however: depending on the usage
    size and the type of setting, this can be an advantage, even though Chucara will
    always seem more <i>legible</i>. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s also another issue: when
    you&#39;re comparing fonts with a wide span of widths &#40;like Times versus Clifford&#41;,
    you need to worry about the proportion of linebreaks in your test text, because
    design widths affects economy much more depending on that. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'OK, now p19 makes sense! <BR> <BR>I would say that in the first comparison
    the &#34;Small&#34; style seems slightly larger on the body than the &#34;Text&#34;
    &#40;even though it&#39;s set 0.4 pt smaller&#41;, but it also has less &#34;apparent
    leading&#34;. While in the 2nd one the apparent sizes are very well matched, but
    the &#34;Small&#34; still has less apparent leading. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Setting
    the leading solid for everything won&#39;t work for the same reason that mainaining
    the same point size across the different fonts won&#39;t work: the proportions
    of the face on the Em affects everything. It&#39;s well known for example that
    fonts with larger x-heights need more leading. <BR> <BR>So I think you have to
    1&#41; match the apparent sizes, then 2&#41; match the apparent leadings, then
    3&#41; compare the economy, then 4&#41; balance it against readability. And always
    remembering that you can sometimes gain readability by <i>reducing</i> the apparent
    size. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
