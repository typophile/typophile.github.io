body: "Hello,\r\nFor my very first time, I have created a webfont in two formats via
  FontSquirrel (hurraa!), but how do I check them? When I open the .ttf web-version
  in e.g. InDesign, everything is OK, but how do I install .woff/.eof, so I can watch
  it/write with it in my browser (Safari)?\r\nI have no web-applications at all, and
  no experiance with webdesign."

  body: 'It''s the whole point of WOFF/EOT that they can''t be installed in a regular
    operating system.  You just link them in your HTML/CSS files and the browser will
    use them. So to test it, you need to prepare a HTML page. The FontSquirrel Generator
    download package should have such test documents already in it. '

  body: "Thanks Ralf. My problem is, that a customer seems to have a few problems
    with some kerning/spacing-issue in a font I have convertet. And I can't see this
    in the test-docu from FontSquirrel! But mayby I have made some bad 'choices' in
    FontSquirrel? Here's my settings:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/17_3986.23.47.jpg]"

  body: "Web browsers normally won\u2019t use the kerning information in fonts. This
    might be the source of the spacing issue. To force modern browsers to use pair
    kerning, add the following line to your CSS text declarations that are using the
    custom font:\r\n\r\n<code>text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;</code>\r\n"

    it's use, but it's not because it's ideal, and I look forward to when I won't
    need to anymore. It was always a kludge. You can get some more info here:\r\n[[http://www.typotheque.com/articles/opentype_features_in_web_browsers]]\r\n\r\nYou've
    really just got to keep an eye on the browser updates at this point, unfortunately.\r\n\r\n"

    strongly recommend combining BOTH approaches rather than taking either by itself\u2014unless
    you prefer one version or another with some kind of ideological passion that takes

  body: "That's a good article. A bit behind on some details, though. Notably Firefox
    switched suddenly to using the \"new\" syntax recently. So you need two lines
    for Firefox, one \"old\" and one \"new\" if you want to catch all browsers....\r\n\r\nTurning
    on the common features that ought to be on by default currently looks like this:\r\n
    \ -moz-font-feature-settings:\"calt=1, liga=1, clig=1, kern=1\";\r\n  -moz-font-feature-settings:\"calt\"
    1, \"liga\" 1, \"clig\" 1, \"kern\" 1;\r\n  -ms-font-feature-settings:\"calt\",

    excited to let you know that we at Fontlab Ltd. have just released the 2nd beta
    of TransType 4 for Mac OS X. With this build, you can convert any font (OTF, TTF,
    plus a number of other formats) into WOFF and EOT webfonts. \r\n\r\nTransType
    4 beta 2 is available free of charge at http://bit.ly/trt4macbeta2 \r\n\r\nThe
    current build 4762 will expire on February 28th, 2013. However, by the time that
    build expires, we will post another build with more features and bugfixes. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!
    \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"
