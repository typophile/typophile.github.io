  is the right sub-forum, so admin please feel free to move this thread. I am looking
  for someone who can layout the cover and interior text of a novel. I have a very
  small budget, but can pay a little for someone who would like to take a shot at
  it. I Please send me an email if you are interested and I can provide more details.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance! "

    with the design and execute it\"? There is a significant difference in cost. Even
    amongst the cheapest of the cheap\r\n(people who work at university presses),
    an interior design will go for about $500 for something simple like a novel, and
    a cover (jacket) from $500 to $800. That jacket charge will likely include typesetting,
    but the interior will add around $4 a page for something simple like a novel.\r\n\r\nNYC
    prices are a bit higher . . ."
