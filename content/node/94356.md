  body: "You or someone will  probably find the font(s), but if not, and all you need
    is a vector  version, you can easily create one with Corel Draw or Adobe Illustrator.
    Either by manually drawing them or by using their auto-trace facilities. There
    are also some free auto-trace programs available, findable with any search engine.\r\n\r\n

  body: Thanks Herb. I could draw it myself using illustrator but I would much rather
    find the font and recreate the logo in minutes and not hours to be honest. It
    doesn't even have to be exact, just close.

  body: Does Univers come close enough? Look for one of the extra or ultra condensed
    variants. "Love" could be regular weight, the other text is bold, heavy, or perhaps
    even as dark as black.
