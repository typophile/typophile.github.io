  buttons have been designed, used, discarded, found and now repurposed. <br><br>Everyday
  information -- once carefully designed by some anonymous person -- passes through
  our hands. Without a thought it does its job and ends up in the trash, or left to
  carelessly flutter to the ground to be found and repurposed.<br><br>Each button
  is of course unique. These are not scanned and printed. They are found, curated
  and lovingly composed in a circular frame.<br><br><a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/35569/\">Read

  body: Brilliant concept, expertly executed. TypeCon will be a button fest, but these
    will be prized like jewels.
