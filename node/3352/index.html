  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've launched a new pixel font foundry. I'm new to many aspects of the game, and don't know what to make of the site's initial performance. <BR> <BR>Last eleven hours: approximately 450 unique visitors, 180 downloads of the font collection pdf, and zero sales. <BR> <BR>When I published my pdf, I tried breaking the fonts into outlines. It didn't display as well, nor did it print as well as embedding the fonts. I'm puzzled as to why. So I published the embedded font version. <BR> <BR>My question: is font exctraction from pdf widespread? I wouldn't think it is, but what do I know? <BR> <BR>My products could simply not be as appealing to flash designers as I thought. I'd like to think that it's too soon to say, but, the initial stats have me concerned.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tyler, you could always add a quid pro quo to the downloading of your PDFs. Meaning, request an email address. If they are looking to steal your font, changes are they won't give you a real email, but if they are sincere in their interest, I would think they'd give you a real name and email. Maybe this would help the odds. (Just a thought.) <BR> <BR>Steve! I thought the answer was: License it! No wonder my debt is out of control. Hehehehe!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kyle, as I hinted at above, my true feeling about consumers is not a mistrustful one. I do not really think that pdf font extracting is a widespread phenomenon. <BR> <BR>The reason I posted the question is really pretty embarrassing. I posted the pdf because I was afraid that the site design might be too click-heavy for potential buyers to view the larger portion of the font library. This, of course, points to poor site design in regards to the ultimate purpose of the site: to sell products. <BR> <BR>I saw that 180 users had looked at all of my pixel fonts at a glance. Embarrasing fact number two: I was dismayed that so many people could see the wide variety of decorative styles and not make a single purchase. <BR> <BR>Such was the faith I had in my untested (in the market place) products. I'm still excited about the site and its launch. I'm simply getting an education. Necessary, I know, but no less awkward for me in the interim.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tyler, <BR> <BR>The amount of visitors, or PDF downloads has nothing to do with what's going on. Dude, you gotta show the fonts man! The only reason people are downloading the PDFs is becuase they're sick of clicking just to see the fonts. <BR> <BR>Your ability with Flash is great and all, but c'mon 6 clicks to see a preview of a specimen showing is just too much work for anybody to see a mini preview of your fonts. <BR> <BR>You're not selling your ability to make Flash animations, you're selling fonts and if we can't see 'em, we're not gonna buy 'em. You need to make it easier for a potential buyer to buy. <BR> <BR>As suggested above, you could certainly take a cue from Atomicmedia.net in the way the fonts are shown on the home page as larger easier to get to previews with a price and a buy now button. You MUST make your fonts appear buyable, your execution hinders this greatly and as a result your sales will continue as they currently are. <BR> <BR>I sincerely hope my advice it taken as constructive criticism and not as anything other than that. I'm all for new foundry's being successful but I see some obvious flaws in your marketing execution that will hinder your success especially since you've probably invested in a secure cert, a shopping cart and a merchant account. <BR> <BR>Good Luck! <BR> <BR>Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tyler, nice site. I agree with Stuart, too many clicks for such a small showing. The &quot;big reveal&quot; is a little disappointing. Especially when it is white type on a pale background. Quite hard to discern exactly the type. It gets a little tedious having to choose between the loose and tight versions as well. Could ye just lump them together? I don't think this thread was meant to turn into a critique! But I think you have some really excellent designs there, we just shouldn't have to drill down so much and so often just to get to them.  <BR> <BR>&gt;&gt;Last eleven hours: approximately 450 unique visitors <BR> <BR>I don't know about web traffic, but that beats the hell out of &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; ; ) Good luck mate! <BR> <BR>kris.</div>

The first is a new method of browsing the fonts, the second, a new way of previewing, testing, and adding a selected font to the cart. <BR> <BR>I think this will  take care of access problems, but would welcome any feedback you may have.
