  I fear the font will stop being supplied with future versions of MS Office. There
  is no reason why that should ever happen, but I can't help the thought. \r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone else have a similar fear? Otherwise it really must be a case of OCD..."

  body: You're generally justified in assuming that if there's anything Microsoft
    can f*** up, they will. But after 96 years, Century Schoolbook has claimed a secure
    spot in the typographic canon.

      Schoolbook has claimed a secure spot. It has been supplied with MS Office since
      version 4.3 (1994), so it seems very unlikely indeed."

    anyway.

    body: I have to agree. I find their feeiling of supriority quite extraodinary.
      Though, their version of Baskerville does look better.

  body: But since Century Schoolbook is used for U.S. Supreme Court briefs, it's impossible
    the font will be discontinued. Tens of thousands of documents would become useless.

    Cambria, etc.), for instance, are incredibly efficient tools. And let\u2019s not
    forget also all the remarkable work done for them by Matthew Carter."
