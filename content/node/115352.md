  inside book cover so that the fonts are clearer. I've identified the title font
  as Edda Pro with some stylistic alternates and customization.\r\n\r\nI would like
  some help with the author and subtitle fonts; namely, the fonts for \"HELENE WECKER\"
  and \"A Novel.\" \r\n\r\nThank you all in advance, and thanks again for being such
  an awesome community and resource."

  body: "HELENE WECKER lacks earmark letters and is small scale so I can't say anything
    definitive. But based on what I can see it looks like something by F.W. Goudy
    in the ball park with his Kennerley Old Style of 1911 [now also sold as LTC Kennerley,
    TC Kingsley & Goudy Bookletter 1911], or one of the fonts that it influenced,
    including Horley Old Style, LTC Village No. 2, Village Titling, etc.\r\nDon"

  body: "Yes, Bickham Script with an extension looks about right for the subtitle.
    LTC Kennerley seems to be the closest for the author font, especially if I squat
    down the font just a tiny bit.\r\n\r\nThank you, Mike and Don!"

    the K it found no matches) from the Search using your wonderful Guide and it was
    the only font shown.

  body: Benni - There were all sorts of alternates for Edda and it doesn't appear
    that Edda Pro has that M (perhaps I missed it). The only digital version of Edda
    I'm aware of with all of your characters (the J and N were modified no matter
    what the font) is a 1992 version copyrighted by both Font Bureau and Microsoft.
    It was bundled with an early version of MS Publisher and never sold outside that.
    Which is just as well ... because the font is, interestingly, very badly made.

  body: "Ooo, thank you, Mike F. Woot!\r\n\r\nRe Edda, yes, the M, N, and J appear
    to be modified--the N and J more slightly so. The M is very customized, and understandably
    so, since the regular M is just...ugly. \r\n\r\nI am unimpressed with the Edda
    font, but what did impress me was this particular use. It's very apt and nice
    for this particular book cover (loved the book). I would never have given this
    particular font another glance if not for this cover.\r\n\r\nThank you all so
    much!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://theculinarycellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wecker-Golem-and-Jinni-book-cover.jpg\">"

  body: Hmmm ... what I'm saying, Benni, is that <em>exactly</em> that M is in the
    FB/MS version. It matters little, though, since the font is tough to come by legitimately
    and is poorly made.

  body: Ah, yes, sorry, I misread. Edda or even Edda Pro won't be a font I'd likely
    buy anyway. As much as I like this cover, I can't think of too many instances
    where I'd want to use Edda.

    is a 100% match. It seems that  F. W. Goudy  concealed  his true identity as a

  body: "Golems are are dumb helpless beings created from mud . Artistic representations
    of them are heavy and formless, i.e. without defined features.\r\nEdda is half
    way there in that it is formless, but it is too cloud like. More suited to a ghost
    story. The cover says that there are wispy vapors of spirits hiding in the dead
    frozen arch, perhaps a winter of the soul after some great loss.\r\nIf that's
    not what the story is about,  I would have chosen a heavier unstructured font
    for the title.\r\nBut since you loved the book, perhaps I am being too critical.
    Feel free to ignore my 25 cent opinion :)\r\nBTW Golem wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem\r\nDon"
