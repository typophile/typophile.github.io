  body: "The initials look similar to an old metal typeface called Vogue Initials.
    There were a number of these ornate initial typefaces, but my books only show
    a few. I guess the lower case letters are from a serif italic.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thank you Mike. The lower case letters have the exact same ornate quality
    as the initials. I wish I could have gotten a better image. Your help has given
    me a great starting point, so I'm very grateful!\r\n\r\nThanks again! Janet"

  body: "One of the other Typefaces shown in that book was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-fournier-le-jeune/|Fournier
    Le Jeune]], which has been digitized by Lanston Type. unfortunately, it has only
    upper case letterforms, even though it has some as small caps. I think you might
    achieve a similar effect by using these initials with an appropriate italic type.\r\n\r\n-

  body: That's a great idea Mike. It might be way too much to have the whole thing
    be ornate. I had no idea this style was so old. Funny how modern it looks. Thanks
    again.
