  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hey. this is a poster for a concert at The Eaves (see logo forum). the main band is casiotone for the painfully alone. they are sort of lofi glitch pop. think 80s beats through a low tech casio keyboard with him singing over it. he sings alot about being lonely and that his house is full of mice. <BR> <BR>the poster will be letterpressed on 17x23 mohawk superfine soft white paper. im going to do an edition of about 40 and sell them at the show for around $10 each. <BR> <BR>this whole concept is really early. so ill be devloping it heavily over the next couple days. i like the first one waaaay more than the second, but thought i oughtta post both. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40986.gif" alt="">  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40987.gif" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The first one has problems with legibility - the hand distracts too much. I also don't think the hand's style matches the type. What is the story behind the rat/mouse? <BR> <BR>The second one is too messy, does the hands have to be there?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for the words john. i certainly was trying to avoid hand scripted pink and blech. squiggly line drawings of.. anything. thanks for noticing. your from portland? i may be moving out there next year. <BR> <BR>here's the next version-no major design changes, just had to add the name of our visiting artist and change the colors, which actually is apartial solution to the readability issue. <BR> <BR>the two colors are pms 381 and 3115. if anyone besides me out there is a pantone whore i know youve already run for your books. anyway, ive done some testing, and on letterpress these two ink - when laid on top of eachother - create a green that is deeper and brighter and either by itself. should make the name pop. but a little readability trouble is fine with me. dont want to make it too easy on the viewer. ha. <BR> <BR>that green looks super yellow on my moniter, but its green. like the pantone. thoughts? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41296.gif" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really really love the hand/glove. Colours in the most recent revision look good. <BR> <BR>The 80's type isn't strong enough to avoid being overpowered by the strength of the glove. I think you should fill the channel in the characters with either white (which would really pick it out), or if you're bothered about the number of colours, fill it in with either the green from the mouse or the background colour. Just to stop the glove interferring. <BR> <BR>I don't think the mouse and the hand are working together in the composition. It would be nice to see the hand over the mouse more implying protection, or the gap between the thumb and the forefinger cupping the mouse's body. At the moment they feel quite seperate.</div>
