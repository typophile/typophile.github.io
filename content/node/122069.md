    glad someone else chimed in. \r\n\r\nThe calligraphy appears to be an attempt

  body: 'Jiulian, this is NOT a font; you will never find a font to match this. It
    was created by hand, using a brush or a pen (or both) and is one of a kind. Both
    Riccardo and kthomp5 have told you this. You may find something similar--several
    excellent suggestions have been suggested by kthomp5. If all you need is the word
    "Moliere" then put this in Illustrator and auto-trace it. '
