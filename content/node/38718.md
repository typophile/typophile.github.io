  body: "This is like some of the work done by Nick Curtis, but I checked his site
    for scripts and also looked at his old Freebie fonts. There were no exact matches,
    but I think you're right that this is from the Deco era. Nick's closest styles
    were <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/pismo-clambake-nf/\">Pismo
    Clambake</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/jaunty-gent-nf/\">Jaunty
    Gent</a>, which only show that the era is similar to his work here.\r\n\r\nIs
    Nick around? Do you recognize this script from one of your books?\r\n\r\n- Mike

    I don't know if this is available in digital form, although the shading of the

    two Gracia scripts at MyFonts, but they are not similar to this in any way. If
    requested I can make a scan from my book and show the entire font, but I will
    need to restart my computer to post the image (grrr!).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Nice work Akira. In Jaspert it says that 'Gracia' (Amsterdam) is one of the
    names it was sold under; also 'Donatello' (Niebolo) and 'Hertha' (Berling). The
    original design goes back to 1926 to Wagner & Schmidt, then cast by many foundries
    in 1927. Troubador Open was a Haas design by E. Thiele from 1931, if I read this
    right.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    originally made his fonts as Mac shareware only. The original Rechtman, I believe,
    can be downloaded from the <a href=\"http://www.erik.co.uk/font/script.html\"

    target=\"_blank\">Faces.com</a> sells commercial versions of some of Rakowski's
    fonts. Presumably they are superior to the old shareware in technical quality
    or character set - but I don't know that for a fact."
