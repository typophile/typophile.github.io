body: hi, sorry if i am posting in the wrong place but i was wondering if anyone would
  be able to tell me where i could get a copy of designershock, by stefan gandle.
  I know there has to be some way i can get my hands on a new or close to new copy.
  I have looked on amazon and no luck, the only copy for sale does not have the cd.
  thanks in advance.
