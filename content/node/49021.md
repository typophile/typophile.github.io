  me their names or availability? I don't even know which script got used in the middle...
  or which modified sans serif is going over the top, or even the decorative antique
  serif at the bottom in brackets, let alone the highlighted wedge serif in the middle...\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, B\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bottle-ref_5177.jpg]"

    are (although yes, the 'Star Trek' association is unfortunate...!)\r\n\r\nAs far
    as the beer/bier lettering at the sides goes, I can't figure out if it's a regular
    compressed sans that has been skewed vertically, or whether it came 'off the shelf'
    like this (I only know of one typeface that was axonometrically skewed, and can't
    remember its name)."
