  from the early 70's and I believe it is related to Clarendon. Other fonts that close
  but were ruled out include Egyptienne, Rockwell, Chunkfive and Blackoak."

  body: Not perfect (mainly the x-height), I like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/champ-ultra|Champ
    Ultra]] by Bob Alonso for the big red central title.

  body: "I believe this early 1970s book cover for a New York publisher would very
    likely have used _Behemoth_ by Dave West at Photolettering 1960, probably photo
    narrowed to fit the cover. Digitized as PL Behemoth  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/atbehemoth/\r\nDon"

  body: "The Photolettering company, like others in the field, produced several widths
    of its designs. \r\nBehemoth, as used in _Chariots of the Gods?_ appears to be
    the condensed version of Dave West's Behemoth. The digitized PL Behemoth is the
    semi-condensed version. An expanded version [or perhaps the regular] was digitized
    by Bob Alonso as Champ Ultra in 1995.\r\nDon"
