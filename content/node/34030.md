    I mark this as found, or is there still a discussion about it being Filosofia

  body: "<em>So there\u2019s more than one version...</em>\r\n\r\nI didn't realize
    that was the case until this thread brought it to my attention. The version I've
    used is copyright 1996. It seems that Emigre (and Zuzana) have updated the font,
    including the OSF. I notice that the spacing is better in the new version, too."

  body: "Good morning?! Could you somehow verify for sure that it has in fact been
    re-spaced? Because that would cast extra suspicion on why they never re-spaced
    Mrs Eaves (which has much worse spacing than anything) even though it had a formal
    OT re-release.\r\n\r\nAnd what could be the reason for having a raised \"3\" at
    first, and then lowering it?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, the version currently offered at myfonts.com is 4.0801. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/filosofia/regular/win-t1/246667/\">They
    indicate</a> that the regular weight (Windows PostScript) contains 2777 kerning
    pairs. The version I licensed for a project a few years back contains 194 kern
    pairs! And that is consistent with a thorough analysis that Kent Lew provided
    in this thread: http://typophile.com/node/459#comment-2948.\r\n\r\nClearly, there
    have been updates. \r\n\r\nIt strikes me as a little odd that the earlier release
    had the raised \"3.\" I can only speculate that it was recognized as a mistake
    and therefore corrected in a subsequent version."

  body: "Interesting - thanks.\r\n\r\nI wonder if they did the spacing fix in-house
    or\r\nthey out-sourced it. In any case, I hope that one\r\nday somebody will fix
    the spacing of Mrs Eaves too.\r\n\r\nI've actually heard a rumor that James Montalbano\r\nonce
    did exactly that for some client (undoubtedly with\r\npremission from Emigre).
    But you know how rumors go.\r\n\r\n> Clearly, there have been updates.\r\n\r\nIt
    would have been nice to alert users about it,\r\nand maybe even provide the upgrades
    for free.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I agree on all counts. I find the 194 pairs totally inadequate, and Mrs. Eaves
    is a nightmare to work with in most settings.
