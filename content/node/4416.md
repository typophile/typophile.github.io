  body: Fine Hand by Letraset?.....with some some alternate characters &#40;T, v,
    P&#41;? <BR> <BR>p.s. I&#39;ve been tracking the forum for a couple months and
    haven&#39;t had the nerve &#40;or speed&#41; to try to identify anything, so my
    apologies if I&#39;m way off base or use the wrong terminology, etc.  I&#39;m
    not a pro.....just a wannabe....haha

    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Nancy, glad you got your feet wet. Looks like a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fine-hand/fine-hand/testdrive.html?s=Thanksgiving%2BPoint&amp;p=48">perfect
    id</a> to me! &#40;The alternates are built into the font.&#41;

  body: Good call Nancy, and welcome to the forums! <BR> <BR>They stole the T from
    the Th ligature and just embellished the P a bit.

  body: Whoopee!  I got one. I was wondering how they did that T......thanks for the
    explanation. <BR> <BR>Now I have a question myself about this one.  Does Letraset
    bundle some of their fonts with some software and if so, do they not include all
    the alternate characters when they do that?  I have Fine Hand and several other
    Letraset fonts, but I could not find the Th ligature or v or P on the character
    map.  I know I didn&#39;t buy Fine Hand separately, so it must have come bundled
    with something &#40;?&#41;

  body: Hello Nancy. Good to have you. Go register! <BR> <BR>Fine Hand is also licensed
    by LInotype and ITC, and they have a  <BR>bundling history, though I don&#39;t
    know with what exactly. Wish  <BR>there was a list for those sorts of things as
    good as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/default.aspx">Microsoft&#39;s</a>.

    <BR>Picture It! 2000 and 2002. <BR> <BR>I got my copy bundled with something,
    though, and I don&#39;t have Picture It!. <BR>I&#39;ll check CD&#39;s when I get
    home in the morning.

    show Fine Hand on the font list on the CD...hmmm. Oh well, it must have come bundled
    with something I have and it doesn&#39;t have all those nice alternates in it
