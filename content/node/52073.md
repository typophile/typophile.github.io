  The company's an online marketplace for tickets(like stubhub and getmein). The site
  is launched early next year. They look at them self as a no-nonsense (in the sense
  that they initially wanted thir site to loook like craigslist), young+fresh, high
  quality company.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for a corporate typeface for these guys?
  Obviously, i've thought of using meta all the way. I'm not a very big fan of meta
  \ though. I thought that a nice slab or sans could  do.\r\n\r\nthanks:-)\r\n\r\nalex "
