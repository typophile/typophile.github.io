body: "Hi all, Id be really grateful for input on this one. It looks to me to be similar
  to Granby and is certainly of that era in terms of when the lettering was applied
  to the sign but its baffling me abit. The 'Stores' word looks to have slightly different
  proportions to the 'Lina' word so they are maybe from different fonts. Perhaps it
  was just an old school signwriter/maker who didnt want to play by the rules, though
  hopefully someone here can enlighten me! Any help/thoughts on this much appreciated.\r\nThanks\r\nArran"

  body: "This is a pretty old shop, and I think that's the original sign. So it's
    probably the work of an English sign writer. Go back there and have a look as
    they sometimes wrote their names very small in the corner of the sign somewhere
    in the olden days.\r\n\r\nAnd buy some fresh pasta while you're at it! I love
    that shop. (or I did when I lived in London).\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "Thanks for the response Nick. I took that snap so have been fairly close
    up, but havent actually checked for a signature in the corner \u2013 will definitely
    look out for that. Do you have any thoughts on fonts that might come close to
    either of the words 'Lina' or 'Stores'? Its actually the 'Lina' word Im more intrigued
    by as the Stores word looks to at least reference Granby or Johnston.\r\n\r\nps
    I bought some pasta from there \u2013 very tasty indeed!"
