  body: Judging by the majority of the business cards I currently have littering my
    desk and note board, I think &#39;cell&#39; or &#39;c&#39; would be the most commonly
    accepted abbreviations. But I have also seen &#39;remote&#39;, &#39;rem&#39;,
    &#39;mobile&#39;, &#39;mob&#39;, &#39;m&#39;, and &#39;clr&#39; used.

  body: I always refer to my cell as my &#39;mobile&#39; phone. But, for a businesss
    card I would go with &#39;cell&#39;.

  body: In Germany, I mostly use the mobile net the cell-phone-user is in, as it is
    an added information &#40;calls from d1 to d2 are more expensive than d2 to d2
    and so on&#41; <BR>So I often end up using D1 or D2 as abbreviation. It doesn&#39;t
    work so wel with the E-net, as it is confusing &#40;although no one would thing
    of a phone number as an eMail-address :-&#41;&#41;

  body: '&#34;Cellular&#34; is a specific technology, like 3G or PCS. So &#34;Mobile&#34;
    is more generic, and often a more appropriate term. <BR> <BR>For cards I prefer
    M or MOB or Mobile.'
