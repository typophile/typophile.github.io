  New &#40;sorry if I offended anyone&#41; ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I wanted to tweak the apostrophe
  and comma because they seemed too thick so I changed them a little in Fontlab. I
  started from a .ttf file and saved as Type 1 &#40;Set as bitstream&#41;. My modifications
  worked fine but when I print, some letters seem to have thickened a little &#40;u,
  r, and n especially.&#41; <BR> <BR>There is no such change on screen, only when
  I print it &#40;using an inkjet printer&#41;. What could cause this? Is there another
  way to save that will keep it from doing this? Is it a matter of bitmaps or something?

  so detailed explanations would be very nice! =&#41; '

  body: 'Probably the hinting is being thrown off &#40;especially since you&#39;re
    switching from TT to T1&#41;. Hints are &#34;extra&#34; instructions embedded
    in fonts to help them render more consistently in low resolutions&#42;. It&#39;s
    something you can tweak yourself, but it&#39;s a lot of work to do right. On the
    other hand, it&#39;s possible that Fontlab&#39;s auto-hinting will do a decent
    job for you. Your best bet is to keep the font as TT, and possibly tweak the hinting
    just for the characters you&#39;re modifying. <BR> <BR>&#42; Normally this affects
    screen rendering most, but for smaller point sizes even laser printers can exhibit
    funny artefacts. <BR> <BR>The other possibility I can think of is a counter direction
    issue. Contours that are turning the wrong way will render slightly darker - although
    I&#39;m not sure why only some of your glyphs would exhibit the problem. Also,
    proper contour direction for TT is opposite that of T1! You can check everything
    manually: T1 contours have to be counter-clockwise for black bodies, and clockwise
    for white &#40;like the inside of the &#34;o&#34;&#41;; or you can use FontLab&#39;s
    automatic process. <BR> <BR>BTW, I think Courier New is covered by the MS font
    EULA, which prohibits font modifications of any kind, even if it&#39;s just for
    &#34;internal&#34; use. But I personally recommend ignoring such clauses in EULAs,
    although I might advise you not to publicize it too much.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Bonne

    no MS <i>font</i> EULA: the core system fonts are covered under the terms of the
    <i>operating system</i> license, according to which opening and modifying the
    font would count as decompiling a system component. I&#39;m willing to consider
    arguments of this kind regarding retail font licenses, because there is room for
    debate in what is &#39;normal&#39; for such licenses, but core system fonts are
    a different kind of thing, developed, paid for and provided to users under a completely
    different model from retail fonts.'

  body: Actually I&#39;m only using it as a school project. <BR>Keeping it in TTF
    worked, thanks! I thought changing it to postscript might make it print better
    but it did the opposite. What are the main differences between T1 and TT? <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve had similar problems with a font I started creating, on screen it
    appeared nicely but printed on inkjet and even a bit on laser some shapes were
    a lot thicker than I had made them. I had created it in illustrator and then imported
    to fontographer. <BR> <BR>Would this be because fontographer might have a worse
    hinting engine than Fontlab&#39;s? Any tips on how to import my font from fontographer
    to fontlab? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to start another thread about EULA in release,
    sounds to me like interesting stuff.

    affects pixel sizes &#40;measured in ppem, i.e. pixels per em&#41;, not point
    sizes, so fractional point values are handled exactly the same way as full point
    values. The rasteriser calculates the relationship of point size and resolution
    to determine ppem size. At low resolutions, there may be no visible difference
    between close point values, e.g. 6pt and 6.25 points, since ppem sizes are whole
    numbers so the rasteriser always rounds to the nearest ppem size.

    have to check the version number of the font to confirm whether you were dealing
    with the OS version or the web package version, since the former almost certainly
    leapfrogs the latter &#40;if it hasn&#39;t yet, it is almost certain to in Longhorn,
