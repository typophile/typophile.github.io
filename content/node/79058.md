body: I've recently been thinking about printing technology and was wondering if inkjet
  output (especially on uncoated paper) "needs" lighter outlines than a font for laser
  or imagesetter output might need. Certainly metal fonts were designed with ink spread
  in mind, so do computer fonts need the same kind of adjustment or is inkjet inkspread
  not that big a deal? As a side question, does the fact that inkjets have some spread
  that other output techs don't mean that fonts like the original digitizations of
  Centaur and Bembo which were always "too thin" in offset and laser output might
  actually be "right" when printed on an inkjet?

  body: The surface of the paper has a lot to control the weight of the type. I use
    laser for smooth paper and delicate type. I use the inkjet for vellum or textured
    surfaces.

    get the chance to speak with Mike, be sure to ask him to tell you the story of
    Starling. And set aside at least 30 minutes. Well worth it.

  body: I think the question is too general. There is so much variation between printers
    and, of course, paper. It's not a question of inkjet vs. laser, for example. A
    good inkjet printer using a good quality inkjet paper has negligible ink spread.

  body: "Also, while the very earliest inkjet printers were crude dot-matrix printers,
    current ones print at resolutions similar to those of laser printers. As a result,
    the droplets of ink involved are small ones.\r\n\r\nAs well, given that the printer
    converts font outlines to dots, normally if corrections for ink spread are required,
    dealing with them appropriately is more the responsibility of the printer designer
    than the font designer. One certainly can, by choice of typefaces, deal with any
    remaining uncorrected ink spread, just as people did in the letterpress era. But
    that's choosing faces with greater stroke contrast and lighter lines - not detailed
    adjustments to typeface outlines.\r\n\r\nThere are just too many kinds of paper,
    and models of printer, out there for the font designer to effectively deal with
    this the way the designers of the newspaper legibility faces could deal with the
    technical problems of their era.\r\n\r\nAnd laser printer resolution, on the other
    hand, keeps going up... so designers have the freedom of treating printers as
    if they're magical devices, able to put exactly what is specified on the paper.
    This is great - once <em>that</em> problem is dealt with, type designers still
    have plenty of other things to worry about."

  body: Thanks for your answers. I guess the upshot of it all is that using an inkjet
    printer doesn't "fix" the thinness of early fonts and that if I want a decent
    Bembo or Centaur, I'll need to shell out for a newer digitization rather than
    relying ink spread to make the late-80s Type 1 versions I have on old 3.5" disks
    look better.
