    well&#41;, but maybe it&#39;s being applied to literally? Just an brainwave -
    maybe I&#39;m making so sense &#91;in this context&#93;. <BR> <BR>Trying to think
    more lucidly: The &#34;E&#34; and &#34;S&#34; seem to have a particular rare charm.
    <BR> <BR>One other thing: I like the separation in the &#34;G&#34; - maybe implement
    that more. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' John - The reliance on the &#41;&#40; parenthetical shapes makes Cronus
    a tough one to pull off. Maybe Scoles can find a similar font that does it. <BR>
    <BR>Somewhere out there, there&#39;s a font based on the McDonald&#39;s Golden
    Arches. While executed okay, it maintains a gimmicky feel. <BR> <BR>Gimmicks are
    fun. Uh, I use gimmicks. But sometimes the end result is not highly usable as
    I have learned. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":&#40;">
    <BR> <BR>&#40;Emigre&#39;s OutWest comes to mind&#41; <BR> <BR>How do you see
    Cronus being used? The answer to that might tell you which direction to take it.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, Cronos is also the name of an Adobe font.&#42; <BR> <BR>I enjoyed
    some of the other faces on your site more than Cronus &#43; the design- and type-related
    content is a good read for Typophiles. <BR> <BR> <BR>www.famished.org <BR> <BR>good
    luck, <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>&#42;do a search on this site to learn more about Cronos. '

  body: ' Thanks for the feedback guys. <BR> <BR>Hrant, I agree with your favorite
    letters. I also like the numeral 2 a lot. <BR> <BR>Good idea on the &#34;G&#34;
    <BR> <BR>To answer BJ&#39;s question, I really didn&#39;t have a use for the font.
    I&#39;m strictly a hobbyist when it comes to fonts. I have to say, though, that
    the comparison to OutWest is an unsettling one because I had always mocked OW
    for its unusability. <BR> <BR>Cronus seems to me to be a concept font, kind of
    like in the fashion industry where they have bizzare outfits on the runway but
    end up using just a couple of elements in their next mainstream clothing line.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks again guys and I will put my thinking cap on to see where to take
    this font... '

  body: OK, thanks to the brutally honest feedback, I have redesigned this font. I
    have also changed its name to Tourmaline due to the similarity with &#34;Cronos.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Basically, I liked the &#34;french fry&#34; shape but decided I&#39;d
    totally overdone it, and that a little bit goes a long way. With that in mind...

  body: ' John - The Art Deco is coming through very nicely and the ligatures are
    a nice touch. <BR> <BR>I think you have a brand new font. Now, with these new
    shapes, the letters that seem out of place are the C D G and Y. <BR> <BR>I think
    you have an entirely diff. cool font &#40;Nu Art Deco?&#41; if you play off the
    sharp style of the &#39;U&#39; which is my favorite letter. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    C ligatures are also great. The OF ligature looks... off. TH is great. <BR> <BR>Nice
    progress, it&#39;s much better than the first display of the font. Art deco rocks. '

  body: ' I see the remnants of the &#34;french fry&#34; shape as being vaguely &#34;arts
    &amp; crafts&#34;, vaguely &#34;Metropolitain&#34; -- the H as it stands now is
    not particularly Art Deco -- but it works, in my opinion. I think every typeface
    should have surprises. <BR> <BR>The letters that for me don&#39;t fit now are
    O and S &#40;the rounder S, not the elongated diagonal S&#41;. The O seems too
    modern. I have yet to fit on a curve that seems right for the face. I was thinking
    maybe a geometric O, but it&#39;s a narrow face.... '
