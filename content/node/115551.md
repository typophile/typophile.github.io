  body: "<blockquote>The <strong>category section</strong>  is absent from the new
    site, by the way, hence the confusion.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nfully agreed! The advantage
    of the category section is that one gets the possibility of accessing the library
    by <em>visual means</em>. Which on the old site got lost a bit on the second level,
    because many families appear several times. Also it was not possible to compare
    weights such as italics, condensed, extended, whatever between families. The FontBook
    app is better of course, but unfortunately lacks this kind of type browsing. I
    still miss a digital implementation of a \u2018type browser\u2019 like <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kupfers/8571656301/\">Berthold
    E3 Headlines</a> or Photolettering\u2019s One Line Manual of Styles. Or Photolettering\u2019s
    <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nicksherman/8609661427\">Alphabet Theasaurus</a>.
    Books like these were rather expensive to produce and for the user, finding the
    right category was always a bit cumbersome. One had to go through the alphabetical
    index first or guess in which classification slot a particular typeface could
    be hiding. And the text in which the typefaces could be compared was of course
    fixed. This could be made so much better, faster and flexible today, but no one
    has really managed to come up with something that comes even close to these books.
    \r\nI think this could be extremely useful when one is looking for a condensed
    text typeface for small text on packaging. Or a bold condensed sans for magazine
    headlines. I think that the lack of this sort of dedicated browsing is one of
    the reasons that unexperienced designers who are looking for a typeface for a
    claim or a brand name usually pick a far too informal script instead of an italic.
    As far as I know, there is simply no web based type browser (my fonts, monotype,
    linotype, anyone?) that allows a user to fast and easily compare similar italics
    with each other in the way one can compare scripts \u2026"

    body: "An interesting tool! Checked [[http://www.identifont.com/differences?first=DIN&second=DIN+Next&q=Go|FF
      DIN and DIN Next]] :\u2013) It does not do what I expect from a digital type
      browser though. As a user, I either think I know what might be similar, or I
      do not know this yet. As a logical consequence, a digital type browser should
      primarily be able to show me what it thinks that is similar instead of asking
      me. In the case of this particular Identifont menue, I\u2019d expect it to work
      it in a way that when I type / pick a name of a typeface I\u2019d like to see
      in the left window, Identifont will present a range of fonts that I can klick
      through in the right window. The name field on top of the right window could
      be used to  add fonts to Identifont\u2019s choice, so that I can compare my
      own guess with that of Identifont."

  body: I really like the new site...real web fonts in use, a responsive design, and
    lots of nice content to discover. [Gosh, I get design-geek shivers looking at
    nice web fonts on my mac w/ retina screen.] The only small suggestion I would
    make is to make your feature section on the homepage to have a little more structured
    grid on large screens. Currently, the content of each box has a lot of visual
    variety and seems to be a bit messy...where a bit more structure (quiet) would
    let each box wave its own flag rather than jostling with each other...

    provides a very 'basic' tool to explain the type differences and it shows rapidly
    its internal limitations as you pointed it out.\r\n\r\nIf you're interesting in
    comparing the many designs of one single typeface,\r\ntry the <em>Garamond</em>
