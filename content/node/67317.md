    a font that is compatible with the orthography.\r\n\r\nA font that's personable
    with a calligraphic flair is good for prayers in general. Something like the current
    header font, Elli from The Font Bureau, would be good for a few lines on a poster,
    though perhaps a bit kitschy depending on the accompanying imagery (I can't really
    think of any spiritual poster I've seen that isn't kitschy), and too informal
    for a page of text.\r\n\r\n"
