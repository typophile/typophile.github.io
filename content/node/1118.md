  body: Nope, a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/tabletpc/"> Tablet PC</a>,
    where you are drawing with a stylus directly on the screen.

  body: Cintiq really is it. <BR> <BR>At least if you are trying to use the stylus
    for any type of artistic feature. It has much more presure sensetivity and such.

  body: When I got my first 6x9 Wacom tablet in &#39;95 I envisioned my <BR>ideal
    computer being just that size/weight with no additional <BR>hardware. Think no
    keyboard - rather true, robust dictation <BR>instead; wireless; super long battery
    life, and no external <BR>monitor - a direct drawing interface screen like the
    Cintiq. <BR>In my recent search for a new system I took a serious look at <BR>the
    latest tablet PC&#39;s. However they only approach what I&#39;ve <BR>been waiting
    for as the specs still fall short, overall. <BR> <BR>I know this is tangential
    to your initial question but I thought <BR>anyone interested in the Cintiq is
    forward-thinking enough <BR>to perhaps share my vision.

  body: I have tried the Fujitsu Stylus and the Motion Tablet PC. The  Stylus is a
    600x800 screen, and the Motion is 768x1024. Both are less than enthralling. Paper,
    pencil and ScanFont are really the way to go here. <BR> <BR>The highest resolution
    touchsceen I&#39;ve seen is the NEC LCD2010X-T at 1280x1024. I don&#39;t think
    it has the pressure granularity that a Cintiq has. Public-use kiosks and specialized
    design tools are two different things. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll reconsider Tablet PCs
    when Apple ships one.
