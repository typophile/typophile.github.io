		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Tiffany. <BR> <BR>I'm attaching a jpeg image of a typical plaque. <BR> <BR>I've actually been doing a fair amount of research on this over the past several days, and I'm learning that, as usual, you get what you pay for.  I have a budget for the simplest casting process, which gives you crudely cut letters and ornamental borders. <BR> <BR>Most commercial operations use a computer-driven process. They take my art, in the form of an eps file, and produce rubber a mold, which in turn replicates a negative image of my plaque in plaster. The molten bronze is poured into the plaster mold. Even  if I do a great job of the typography, this process forces a two dimensional object to live in three dimensions, and the results are dicey. <BR> <BR>To make it worse, in 3d, a letter needs &quot;draw,&quot; that is, seen in section, it has a bit of a slope on each side. This allows the casting to be separated from the mold after the bronze has hardened. The foundry sands the raised elements to a &quot;satin&quot; finish&ndash;but as they remove material, the letter forms get fat &amp; awkward. It's like applying a &quot;bold&quot; style in Word. <BR> <BR>I've tried to minimize the bad effects by using a robust sans serif font (Syntax), which can stand up to some abuse. It's also possible to get better results by doing a chemical etch instead of a casting, but many of my clients expect a cast plaque. <BR> <BR>For about 3 times my per-plaque budget, good foundries will create a mold by hand and use some real artistry in shaping letters that are sculptural and quite beautiful. <BR> <BR>The question remains, though, are there any techniques out there that will let me improve the results without tripling my budget? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/67459.jpg" alt="Common plaque close"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Daniel, the boards are a little touchy. If you do send a post and receive an error the best thing to do, before you try posting again, is to refresh the page. <BR> <BR>I'll take care of the duplicates. <BR> <BR>I wonder if using an unbracketed serif typeface, such as <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=FF.11118.3.11&amp;attributes.sampleSize=48&amp;sampleText=AaBbCc+Handgloves&amp;sampleSize=288" target="_blank">Scala</a>, might be suited for this? I personally don't like Scala printed on high quality paper because it is just too crisp, it sparkles too much. However, I do like it printed on cheap paper as it softens it up a bit. I wonder &hellip;. Hmm.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Daniel, could you show a nice close-up (maybe by placing one of your plates directly on a flatbed scanner and making a hi-res image) overlaid with the actual original letterforms? <BR> <BR>Maybe if we know exactly how the letterforms are being &quot;degraded&quot; by the process, we can figure out what [kinds of] fonts can survive it best - and quite possibly even <i>improve</i>. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I second Hrant's suggestion: it would be good to get some close-up images of what happens to the letters in this casting process. Ideally, it would be good to have close-ups of the rubber and plaster molds too, so we can see to what degree the degradation is due to each stage of the process. One way to address 'crudely cut' letters is to use letters that are deliberately 'crude' in appearance (although not crudely made) such as Koch's Neuland, but stylistically this might not meet your needs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This certainly seems like the sort of thing that a Multiple Master font would have been good for: perhaps Chapparal MM. Alas, I pretty sure you can't buy it from Adobe anymore.  Failing that, you might be want to look for a face that has a lot of individual weights and a &quot;spartan&quot; finish: Stone's <a href="http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/html_pages/MagmaOverview.html">Magma </a>comes to mind; perhaps the &quot;halo&quot; version of the light weight.</div>
