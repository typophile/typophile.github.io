  body: "Hi Serge,\r\n\r\nthis is, as you know, a custom logo and therefore there\u2019s
    no font with such a \u2018R\u2019.\r\nSimilar forms for l, e, i:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/standard-bq/ex-bold/\">Berthold
    Standard  Extra Bold</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-sb/med-ext/\">Europa
    Grotesk SB-Medium Extended</a> (latter is a little bit closer than any original
    Helvetica, afaik).\r\n\r\n"
