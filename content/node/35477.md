body: "No better way for a programmer/typophile to begin their first post than with
  a cheerful <i>hello world</i>.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what I will post in the future.
  I figure images of some nice typography would be quite snappy. Let's start now...\r\n\r\nI'm
  a huge fan of Arabian inspired calligraphy. One main difference is the character
  set and the fact that it is written from right to left. I suggest readers of this
  post <a href=\"http://www.sakkal.com/ArtArabicCalligraphy.html\" target=_blank>see
  some classical examples of Arabic calligraphy</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd now, onto the newer
  styles of Arabic calligraphy! The following are in use in Dubai, UAE. See the attachments.\r\n\r\n1.
  Nakheel (Property Development)\r\n2. Arabian Hub (Property Development)\r\n3. Sama
  (Media)\r\n4. Gulf Art Fair\r\n5. Gulf News (Newspaper)\r\n6. Khaleej Times (Newspaper)\r\n7.
  Dubai Bank\r\n8. Dubai International Arabian Horse Championship\r\n\r\nI'll add
  more late. There's a couple of jewels that I cannot find right now.\r\n"
