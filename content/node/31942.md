  body: "So far I have had no luck finding this. The closest resemblance, at least
    from a 'structural' standpoint was <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/drewfonts/jester/extended/\">Jester
    Extended</a> from DrewFonts.\r\n\r\nWhat does this scan come from, and how new
    (or old) is it? Is it the only sample of these letters you have seen in use? \r\n\r\n-
