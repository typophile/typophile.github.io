body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI was wondering what popular san serifs have the best color and
  spacing when set in body text sizes?\r\nIn your expert opinion do you believe in
  general that humanistic san serifs have between color, spacing, and textual reader
  flow than other sans serifs: geometrics, grotesks?\r\n\r\nI am not a fan of Helvetica
  with it\u2019s uneven spacing and color. I have seen and admired the type samples
  of the commercially unavailable Haas Unica and feel it is a better design than the
  different commercial flavors of Helvetica.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance."

  body: "I agree with you that humanist proportions--oval rather than circular--space
    better and work better for text. However, when there is a smaller x-height, as
    in Futura, it does seem to help the spacing of geometrics in text. I'm not sure
    why--maybe it allows looser spacing while still keeping the words together visually
    as a unit. I've been particularly impressed by how Vesta--oval and pretty narrow--works
    in text. Still, none are as good for extended text as good serifs, I think. \r\n"

  body: "Hi William,\r\n\r\nThank you for your keen insights. I prefer serifs for
    extended texts as well. I have seen but have not had the opportunity to use Vesta
    yet... it is a well designed and quite legible at smaller text size.\r\n\r\nYou
    made a really interesting observation regarding geometric san serifs... I am wondering
    if you or other typophiles could expand on your thoughts about the smaller x-height
    geometric sans that allow looser color/spacing while keeping the words together
    and legible in textual settings.\r\n\r\nI am also wondering what you think are
    the most legible and best color/spaced humanistic san serifs. I really admire
    Avenir which seems to have both traces of humanistic and geometric  letter forms.
    When I am comparing potential humanistic san serifs are look at the fluidity of
    text flow in textual settings as well as how the individual letterforms flow from
    one letter to the other... I am curious to see which humanistic san serifs Typophiles
    might think are the best in color and spacing in textual settings."

  body: Legato reminds me of Stone - and Lucida. They seem to belong to a distinct
    kind of sans-serif font that is becoming very popular with designers these days.
    I'm not sure that there's a name for this category as yet, at least not one that
    doesn't lump them together with, say, Gill Sans.
