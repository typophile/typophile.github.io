body: "I wondered how Stephen managed to have double the number of posts of the next
  most prolific poster. Tonight when I logged in, I saw the reason: there are two
  of him! (And when you mouse over the icons, both say \"Stephen Coles's picture\".)\r\n\r\nI
  need to find out the secret so I can get my work done and still have time to have
  fun.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DoubleStewf_5888.png]"

    ID thread on his iPhone while the water boiled.

  body: So, James said perhaps he was connected via iPhone. I was out to dinner and
    while waiting for my bill, I fired up Safari on my iPhone, and got the big "this
    page is in Flash, but the iPhone doesn't have Flash lego block". So how do people
    browse via the iPhone?

  body: I think it's just the start page that doesn't work at all on the iPhone. On
    the phone, I usually directly access my user track page, which works like a charm.
    The cool thing is that the top nav bar is replaced by a HTML version, so once
    you're in there, you can navigate and all.
