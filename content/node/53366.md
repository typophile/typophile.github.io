  and I cannot in layman's terms find an explanation or definition of 'head.yMax'\r\n\r\n(Point
  2) Also noticed that Font Validator nearly finds fault with every Font I own that
  I run through it. What is it with that?\r\n\r\nI run free & nasty fonts off the
  web through Font Validator. \r\nProblems found with the font.\r\n\r\nBeautifully
  designed and reputable commercial fonts through it.\r\nProblems found with the font.\r\n\r\nFonts
  that come with Apps through it.\r\nProblems found with the font.\r\n\r\nFont Validator
  normally has issues with most of my fonts.\r\nYet, the Fonts run correctly in real
  life?\r\n\r\nSo I think, what chance has a newbie got with Font Design when Font
  Validator picks out something on every font!...whether it's processes or standards
  being left out,wrong sizing, contours or nodes not being to its liking, etc?\r\n\r\nPlease
  comment on either point.\r\nCheers"

    table. xMax is the topmost extremum found in all glyphs, usually calculated automatically
    e.g. by FLS5.\r\n\r\nAs to the more general question: Like every testing tool,
    FontValidator tests what its programmers told it to test. Regard results as hints
    -- in the end it is <em>you</em> who decides if this or that is an error or not."
