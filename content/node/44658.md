  but the reason that have been taken me to write you is because i\xB4m trying to
  find the best typeface to represente John Ruskin Gallery in Cambridge School of
  Art,\r\n\r\nI was thinking to bring up the connotations from the Art & Crafts Movement
  with William Morris influences as well. I\xB4m not sure whether i should be using
  Calligraphy or Lynotype. The sign for the Gallery is going to have Ruskin Gallery
  written on it but as well I\xB4m thinking to create a symbol with just R G in a
  circle to be recognised by all the viewers\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hear your comments!\r\nKind
  regards"
