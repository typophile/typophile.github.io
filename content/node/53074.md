    emphasized.

  body: "I would suggest looking more closely at the type and trying other ideas/typefaces.
    Perhaps look at some vintage American industrial or Constructivist logo designs
    for inspiration and guidance. \r\n\r\nWhen looking at your spacing\u2013don't
    you find it queer that the two Ts in the middle draw so much attention? It looks
    like they are meant to add meaning with the strong counter shapes they produce,
    when it's actually just a case of you not putting thought into the spacing between
    each letter. "

  body: "First off, thanks for the thoughtful feedback.  I do want to clarify something
    that probably didn't come across in the original post - the logo shown is an existing
    logo which I am trying to overhaul into something with a more professional aesthetic.
    \ Not that this point matters a whole lot, but in these situations it is sometimes
    good to keep some resemblance to the original to provide a mental link for those
    who knew it.  So, perhaps this is something to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nThe kerning
    point is a good one, and I agree wholeheartedly.  The logo I showed was first
    done about four years ago, and I will fully admit that I used to be pretty naive
    with respect to that sort of thing.  I'm glad it came up though, because the issue
    has been on my list of 'fixes' and I appreciate the fact that others feel the
    same.\r\n\r\nAs for the emphasis on the H, it was cribbed from this logo here:
    \ http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5a/Browning.svg\r\n\r\nI kind of
    like the quirky turn-of-the-century industrial aspect that it represents, and
    would like to keep it in the overall design if possible.  That said, if I or someone
    else comes up with a better way, that's great too.\r\n\r\nThe Constructivism comment
    is great - I didn't know the style by that term, but that is exactly the sort
    of thing I had in mind for this.  Thank you so much for educating me on that bit
    of information :)\r\n\r\nWith all this in mind, can salisae or anyone else suggest
    some specific typefaces or concepts that would be worth applying?  Please forgive
    my lack of depth in this specific subject area; I am trying hard to learn.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for all your help.\r\n"

  body: I also want to add that one typeface that I tried and kind of like is Neutraface.  That
    said, one sees this *everywhere* these days, so I'd like to avoid something that
    might be cliche.  The lowered crossbar on the H is something that provides some
    emphasis and might be a way that I can reduce the difference in height between
    the T/H and the other characters.  Do you all feel the same way about Neutraface
    getting played out?  If so, I may find my way with a different typeface and lower
    the crossbar myself as I manually edit the logotype if I can find a way to do
    this without it looking 'off'.

  body: "Sorry to keep replying to my own thread, but I guess the ability to edit
    one's post goes away after a bit.\r\n\r\nHere is the most recent effort on this
    logo overhaul.  A few of my own notes:\r\n\r\n1.  I think that extending the T
    arm and hooking it into the H whilst dropping the H crossbar reduces a lot of
    the emphasis that the H used to have, while retaining the look.\r\n\r\n2.  The
    extended arm on the T is also suggestive of a construction square.\r\n\r\n3.  The
    lowercasing of the I was done because I felt it was getting 'lost' amidst all
    that T action going on right next to it.  It also invokes an umlaut. While we
    all know there's no such thing as an umlaut I in the German language, I wanted
    to reference the Germanic origin of the name (which is a family name).\r\n\r\n4.
    \ The overall color of the logo was changed to red which I feel is a much stronger
    color than blue and plays into the Constructivist/construction angle of it all.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    thanks for any criticism that you might have.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo

  body: "The font in the Browning logo has big slab serifs that form a strong horizontal
    element to unite the letters into a single shape (important here because \"Trittenbach\"
    is such a long name). You've achieved the same effect by spanning the letters
    with the cross stroke of the T. \r\nIt appears that the T and H are not only bigger
    than the other letters, but proportionately thicker. How would it look if you
    reduced the stroke weights to match the letters in the middle?"

  body: "That looks a whole lot better! PublishingMojo's comment about the weight
    is definitely something to look into (offset path). Also, look into balancing
    the middle horizontal aspect (H crossbar with the A crossbar, etc.)\r\n\r\nI personally
    don't mind the N extra feature but that's just me. It adds more character and
    makes it memorable. "

    thought I'd come back again and show the final draft.  The figure has some tweaking
