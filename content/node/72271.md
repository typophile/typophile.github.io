  \"A\" looks good too.\r\nI would settle for something similar.\r\nMaybe something
  that belongs in a vintage boxing match.\r\n\r\nThank you, thank you in advance."

  body: Very close Andreas, but I don't think that's it. The "K" is very different
    from Eurostile.

  body: K and E in WORKERS look like from a different font (some weight and width
    of Futura?) or much distorted. Also the two R's in that word look slightly different
    (see upper left corner). I think there is some manual work in it.
