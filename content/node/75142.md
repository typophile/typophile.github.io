body: "(the title isn't what you immediately think, honest!!)\r\n\r\n\r\nHello there,\r\n\r\nI've
  been a stalker of these forums a long time, and I'm hoping you can all help me with
  this request.\r\n\r\nA little while ago, I remember reading a journal or a blog
  someone had written that basically had a long list of \"free\" downloadable typefaces
  you could get, but then pointed out that they were exact copies of original typefaces
  (some of which are default on most computer systems) and this relates closely to
  my 8,000 word dissertation and FMP that I am researching for my Third Year of University.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is, I've lost the article between now and then, and only have a handful
  of examples to work with.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm asking, is what free fonts do you know
  of that are confirmed to be rip offs of original typefaces (is original the right
  word? I hope so). If you know of the article, even, that would great also!\r\n\r\nThank
  you for any help you can give me here!"

  body: Actually Nick, I think there is some confusion. Bouwsma has, over the years,
    appropriated "Arthur's style " and possibly a bit of his work. That statement
    is probably not blunt enough, but it will suffice for the moment.  Most, if not
    all of his "creations" (Bouwsma) are the result of Arthur's generous mentoring
    and the use of a tool, the Coit pen, that Arthur was instrumental in designing.
    I find it odd, and offensive that Bouwsma never mentions Arthur or the books that
    were the source for some of the fonts he claims are his "creations."

  body: I can't agree with that statement. Just because people use the same tools
    and work in the same field does not make them rip-offers. A lot of designers are
    (at least at first) inspired by their teacher, sometimes to the degree that the
    works look a lot alike. This is not new, as this was the case already centuries
    ago, when artists were organised in guilds and transferred their knowledge in
    a master-student relationship. Inspiration is not the same as ripping of, especially
    when a lot of people are fishing in the same pond (like in typedesign). And then
    there is the phenomenon of the revival, working in a specific style (like geometric
    sansserif). Are all designers that create a new geometric sans-serif be called
    rip-offers of Futura? It seems silly.

    There might be a lot of fonts out there, which are closely \"inspired\" by originals,

  body: "I am a little unsure, but here I tend to agree with Uli (which is rare indeed).
    Although I am glad to have Huckleberry, because it means I have a pretty good
    font ready to hand to visualize this great typeface (I wouldn't even know where
    to get Mark Twain), I do think that Canada Type should ask those designers still
    alive whether or not they would agree to having their intellectual property revived.\r\n\r\nI
    was always glad to have Canada Type, because they basically revive old typefaces
    which would otherwise, for the most part, not be available on my Mac, and then
    I couldn't work with them. On the other hand, it does not feel good to know I
    am using a font which was NOT made with the consent of the designer. There should
    be some more respect here. I think Rebecca and Patrick are doing good work, saving
    many of those typefaces I am particularly fond of - but they should really really
    give more credit to the original designers. It must be quite strange for Gustav
    Jaeger to read his name on the Myfonts website, although he never consented to
    have something like Huckleberry made. \r\n\r\nHmmmmm..... my moral compass does
    not like it. Although I would of course not put it as rude as Uli did, because
    I do understand that Rebecca's and Patrick's reasons are by no means purely monetary,
    I daresay it is close to criminal, nevertheless. Maybe not in a legal way, but
    certainly in a terms of moral. *sigh*"

    on typeface-designs (not the font files of course), which are not in public domain
    yet, even if it is not illegal. Anyhow this is a question where the problem of
    \"similarity\" is a very gray area, and an ideological black&white view does not
    do justice to this problem. \r\n\r\nOne could claim Sterling is a rip-off of TNR,

    most people would see it as a legitimate product, right?\r\n\r\n"

    Helvetica and Arial. I'm currently at the beginning stage in my project where
    my tutor literally wants to see loads and loads of made images, to do that, I

    Antiqua. It's not about taking the typefaces and saying: This is wrong, this is
    right, it's about educating and giving a choice. I mean, even Helvetica and Arial
