  (I'm assuming this was hand drawn). I need a classy script font for a client's Deluxe
  Kombi Van Service but I don't want to pour in hours drawing it myself by hand.\r\n\r\nHe
  does a lot of events like weddings so I'm looking for something that looks quality,
  elegant, a little bit retro and a little bit \r\n'hipster'.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any
  help, cheers!\r\n\r\nBilly."

    target='_blank'>Mousse Script</a> and <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/silk-script/'
