body: "In maths, double-struck letters are used every day. Today I\u2019ve found out
  they have a quite interesting history. From the Wikipedia article:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n[Blackboard
  bold] originated from the attempt to write bold letters on blackboards in a way
  that clearly differentiated them from non-bold letters, and then made its way back
  in print form as a separate style from ordinary bold, possibly starting with the
  original 1965 edition of Gunning and Rossi's textbook on complex analysis. Some
  mathematicians, therefore, do not recognize blackboard bold as a separate style
  from bold: Jean-Pierre Serre, for example, has publicly inveighed against the use
  of \"blackboard bold\" anywhere other than on a blackboard, and uses double-struck
  letters when writing bold on the blackboard.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nAnd from another
  [[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.text.tex/Vb0DuAgmPO4|discussion]]:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n[Such]
  symbols were first used in polycopied/mimeographed notes, and similar materials
  prepared on typewriters. Although (as I recently mentioned in another thread in
  c.t.t) there was at least one office typewriter (an Olympia) for sale by the mid
  1960s with a built-in \"poor man's bold\" doublestrike function, for a long time--until
  the era of Typ-It insertible type bars, and not too much later the IBM Executive
  and Selectric lines of typewriters--about the best that could easily be done to
  fake \"bold\" was to overstrike an uppercase I (or a single quote) on your R or
  C. Given a Selectric, one had the further option of doublestriking your R, C, Z,
  Q, or N with a slight offset (this involved manual intervention with the device
  that carried the \"golf-ball\" type element, and was very hard to do consistently).\r\n</blockquote>"

    necessary to overcome the limitations of the physical media. I guess that Typ-It
    insertible type bars were a little before my time: I began operating dedicated
    strike-on machines in 1966, when the Varityper 1010F had been well-established
    for years, and the IBM Selectric Composer was just emerging. Fake bolding wasn\u2019t
    necessary on either of these machines if you purchased a boldface type element.\r\n\r\n"
