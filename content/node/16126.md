body: Does anyone know where I can access Union (as seen at <a href="http://praegnanz.de/essays/391/union">praegnanz.de</a>)
  which is a free analogue to FF Olsen? Anyone know of quality Olsen alternatives
  (preferably free)?

  body: "It was my understanding (according to Vitaly Friedman's <a href=\"http://www.alvit.de/blog/article/20-best-license-free-official-fonts\">25
    Best License-Free Quality Fonts</a>) that Union was available for free from the
    Danish Ministry of Education. However, upon following the link provided, there
    seems to be no discernable download available and unfortunately my Dutch is a
    bit rusty, so I can't really make heads or tails of the page I'm directed to.\r\n\r\nI
    figured that as long as it's license-free, I may as well take advantage of it.
    I would've preferred getting some useful information, but thanks for the snide
    comment anyway, hrant."

  body: "> Union was available for free\r\n\r\nWhich is fine. But your apparent desire
    to avoid paying for\r\nFF Olson at all costs (pardon the pun) can't be expected
    to\r\ngo over well in a place like this. Also: getting something\r\nfrom a source
    that most certainly <cite>has</cite> paid for it, and for\r\nthe ability to distribute
    it, is way different than simply\r\nfinding a free imitation. At the very least,
    it would en-\r\ncourage more such font commissions.\r\n\r\nSo my objection wasn't
    to your attempt to find Union.\r\nSnide? You prefer Chester's reaction? Or maybe
    you'd\r\nprefer the reaction of the many font fuhrers in our\r\nfield, who might
    have you blacklisted for even asking\r\nsuch a thing. I was actually being quite
    gentle.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "as i speak german, i can give you a bit of help. gerrit writes essays about
    fonts, named \"type of the day\". mostly they're free fonts (i mean really free,
    no ripoffs or something), and he always writes something about the law-aspect
    of it. how you may use it and not, etc. \r\n\r\nunion was built by Morten Rostgaard
    Olsen who also designed - right, you guessed it - FF Olsen. this was a \"spin-off\"
    designed (or released?) for the danish ministry of culture.\r\n\r\napparently,
    this ministry had this font as a download on its page, with the EULA only in danish.
    so he assumed it was free (yes, i know.. he shouldnt..). then, someone got him
    an english version of this eula, and there is the sentence \"these fonts may be
    used in projects related with the danish ministry of culture. for other uses,
    please contact M.R. Olsen. Adress: [...]\". \r\n\r\nafter a while, the site was
    updated and there was just a notice to contact mr. olsen directly if you would
    want to use it."

  body: well hrant, but you cant just say everybody who uses freely available fonts
    is a bad guy. not all clients are ready to pay for fonts - not all projects can
    be reason to buy new fonts (often i do small jobs for like 50$ - how should a
    font fit into this budget?). if there is a free (and worth!) alternative, i think
    people should be able to use it.

    body: I'd wager many people here (like myself) are *not* professionals who can
      write things off on their taxes, or bill a customer. So anything quality that
      is (legally) free is definitely of interest to people who don't want to "steal"
      fonts, and don't have a lot of money. I keep seeing your  attitude in different
      threads, and finally had to say something.

  body: "one reality is that you simply do not need to license new type for every
    project. it is possible to use the same group of well chosen (and properly licensed)
    type families for many projects. any designer who thinks they can't possibly do
    this needs to stop and start again. \r\n\r\nit is understandable, however, that
    one might want to experiment. that said, it shouldn't be at the expense of the
    type designers. \r\n\r\nthe best thing you can do is allot a certain amount of
    money in a given time period specifically for licensing type. make a list of fonts
    you would like to -- albeit slowly -- license. budgeting is key. (if not you'll
    end up like me, so much type and very little credit.)\r\n\r\nmason, if you think
    hrant was mean, be glad that yves or myself didn't answer the call first. =^>
    in the grand scheme of things, typefaces aren't expensive. sure, there are foundries
    whose type i can but covet from afar as i'll never have (well perhaps someday)
    a budget for them. but think of it this way:\r\n\r\nif you started a logo project
    for a client. and they suddenly disappeared after only haven given you a deposit
    and yet weeks later you see a truck driving down the road with one of your ideas
    for them on it. how would you feel? typefaces are less expensive than logos. \r\n\r\nwe
    are in a business that requires certain tools. yes, we have to pay rent and buy
    food and pay utilities. but we chose our career and so we chose the expenses that
    go along with it. "
