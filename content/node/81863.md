  to find an answer, and this is the only reason I have subscribed to this list. So
  please give me a break and put me out of my misery by shedding light on my ignorance.\r\n
  \r\nI am currently doing an on-line job that involves grading standardized writing
  tests for seventh graders. Something peculiar I have noticed in their handwritten
  answers is the odd writing of an \"s\". Instead of the top and the bottom of the
  \"s\" being at 12 and 6 o'clock, these \"s\"'s have been written so that the top
  and bottom are more at like 2 and 8 o'clock. And they are always very fat and very
  curvy.\r\n \r\nI am culturally deprived, as I do not watch tv, nor do I follow much
  but music and politics. I am also a tad older (48), and therefore am sure I am not
  running into the same things that a seventh grader would.\r\n \r\nSo, can someone
  help me out here? I've tried googling \"s\" logo images, and I even thought maybe
  Justin Bieber wrote his name this way (I do, after all, get some popular culture
  exposure when I log on to my e-mail account, so I know he is all the rave with this
  crowd). But no go.\r\n \r\nAny kind soul prepared to help me out with this one?
  I thought it seemed like a good place to ask the question. And I am a curious sort,
  at that.  Pardon me if you previously read this in the general discussion area,
  but I think I've been re-directed to post here."

  body: Oh, sorry.  Well, the discussion seems to be getting somewhere in the "general
    discussion" area, and a sample has been posted there by someone else, who has
    run into the same thing.  Thanks.  I think I'll just stay over there on this one.
