body: "Dear Type Technicians,\r\n\r\n\r\nI have posted a little piece of software
  in your favorite script language that you can use to hack your OpenType features
  into your fonts.\r\n<em>Dancing Shoes</em> does not invent the features for you.
  But it takes care that they are put out in the correct order and syntax, and works
  around some possible bugs with FontLab\u2019s built-in FDK compiler that should
  work according to the manual. For instance some <em>script</em> and <em>language</em>
  tags must not be preceded by others, although that should not be important according
  to the manual.\r\n\r\n<em>Dancing Shoes</em> is especially useful if you generate
  feature code with multiple scripts, languages and lookupflags within one feature.<!--break-->\r\nBut
  it can also ease the recurring task of applying features to all your fonts. Because
  you\u2019ll most likely always use the same naming scheme for your glyphs (<em>.sc</em>
  for SmallCaps etc), you can keep these in a separate, hard-coded file, and re-apply
  them with one click or from within another script.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou initialize the
  DancingShoes object:\r\n<code><strong>\r\nfrom dancingshoes import DancingShoes\r\nshoes
  = DancingShoes(glyphs, features)</strong></code>\r\n<em>glyphs</em> is a list of
  your font\u2019s glyph names and <em>features</em> your hard-coded and ordered list
  of feature names.\r\n\r\nThen you can add substitutions like this:\r\n<code><strong>shoes.AddSubstitution('liga',
  'f i', 'fi')</strong></code>\r\n\r\nor, more complicated:\r\n<code><strong>shoes.AddSubstitution('rlig',
  'afii57457 afii57455', 'uniFC61', 'arab', '', 'RightToLeft,IgnoreBaseGlyphs', 'ARABIC
  LIGATURE SHADDA WITH DAMMA ISOLATED FORM')</strong></code>\r\n\r\nYou can then print
  the feature code like this:\r\n<code><strong>print shoes.GetFDKCode()</strong></code>\r\n\r\nor,
  in case of a FontLab font object, use the helper funtion (<em>font</em> being your
  FontLab\u2019s font object:\r\n<code><strong>\r\nfrom dancingshoes.helpers import
  AssignFeatureCodeToFontLabFont\r\nAssignFeatureCodeToFontLabFont(font, shoes)\r\n</strong></code>\r\n\r\n\r\nFor
  now, only substitutions and positioning lookups (Type 1 and 2) are supported. Which
  should be enough for most use scenarios. Other lookup types (like mark positioning)
  will be added later.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll find it here, along with documentation:\r\n[[http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/code/dancingshoes/]]\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
  free.\r\nBut as always: Should you use it for production of your professional fonts,
  a donation is highly appreciated."

  body: "Yanone, \r\n\r\nby \"manual\", do you mean the FontLab Studio manual or the
    Adobe FDK for OpenType documentation? (http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html
    ). We certainly recommend using both documents for reference. However, one needs
    to remember that FontLab Studio 5 uses the AFDKO library version 1.6, while Adobe
    now ships AFDKO library version 2.5. The new version of the library will be used
    in Fontographer 5 and in FontLab Studio 6. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    the FDK compiler in FLS5 is much older, which is why <em>Dancing Shoes</em> tries
    to provide work-arounds to some of its quirks.\r\n"

    to all your fonts.\u2019</em>\r\n\r\nWhich is a sensible thing to do. As you probably
    know, in the FM tools, including DTL OTMaster, listed OT Layout features that
    don't match the character set are simply removed during compiling. This makes
    it possible to use a standardized OT Layout features file that contains <strong>all</strong>
    possible features and to generate OpenType fonts (in batch with DataMaster). Everything
    that is supported by the AFDKO is supported by the FM tools also.\r\n\r\nLike
    DataMaster, OTMaster supports the latest build of the AFDKO 2.5. Because it is
    possible in OTM to export the features in a file, one can re-use this file in
    the app for compiling OT Layout tables for other fonts (batch is on the to-do
    list). For instance FontLab Studio users can easily update their fonts this way.
    The exported features file needs some updating then though, because of the syntax
    changes since the AFDKO 1.6.\r\nIn contrast with DataMaster, OTM will not supply
    the user with detailed info concerning syntax errors, so some knowledge of the
    matter is required.\r\n"

  body: "Malcolm, \r\n\r\nthe Adobe FDK for OpenType library used by FontLab Studio
    is incorporated into the source code of FontLab Studio. Fontlab Ltd. has a license
    for the source code of AFDKO. We do not use the freely downloadable binary version
    of AFDKO, since the use of AFDKO inside of FontLab Studio requires direct linking
    into the source code. \r\n\r\nWo when Adobe releases an updated version of the
    AFDKO source code, Fontlab Ltd. will be able to update FontLab Studio \u2014 but
    this is not always completely trivial. \r\n\r\nSince version of 1.6 of AFDKO,
    Adobe have extended and changed many aspects of the library, and introduced new
    functionalities (such as intelligent outline scaling or the Adobe autohinting).
    Also, support for mark attachment and additional lookup types have been added.
    Finally, some major changes to the syntax have been done. So we do need to modify
    FontLab Studio on our end to make it work with newer version of the library \u2014
    therefore it's not a change that the users will be able to do themselves. \r\n\r\nOur
    work on Fontographer 5 is well under way, quickly approaching release. This will
    be the first product that will incorporate the new AFDKO library. FontLab Studio
    6 and TransType 4 will follow later this year. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"
