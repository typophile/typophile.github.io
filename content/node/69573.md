body: "I went to see an exhibition today on the life of women in Helsinki 100 years
  ago. In one room there was an old aluminium pawn shop sign which stated opening
  times as: 10\u20131/2 4, that is 10 to 15.30. In Finnish, puoli nelj\xE4 (puoli
  = half, nelj\xE4 = 4) is the same as half past three, but I've never seen it written
  like the sign in the museum. Unfortunately I was not allowed to take pictures there,
  I would've loved to show it to you!\r\n\r\nBelow is a very rough reconstruction
  of the essence of the sign (as per requested by Chris!)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/panttilainaamo_3614.jpg]"

    is also the way we say it.\r\n\r\nOn a sort-of laterally-related note, the Swiss
    50 cent coin reads \"\xBD Fr.\" (for \xABFranc\xBB/\xABFranken\xBB), which visitors
    usually find funny, or confusing, or both.\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CHF_50_Rappen_1969.jpg"

    the sign made perfect sense, I've just never seen anything like it."

  body: "\"\xBD Fr.\" is greatly more informative than \"ONE DIME\". It even beats
    its counterpart \"QUARTER DOLLAR\" because it's in numerals and doesn't require
    the language."
