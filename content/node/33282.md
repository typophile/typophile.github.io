  it, as the Stars' is somewhat cheesy. Star = A, get it? And Helveticaaaa... Always
  tough adapting second-hand goods (it made more sense when they were the Minnesota

    later bought a game with 3D players and painted them Boston Bruins vs Chicago

    grew up playing ice hockey on ponds, rivers, flooded backyards and fields but
    when we got older and more competitive you had to play only indoors on rinks and
    never use your good skates on ponds since they aren't smooth and have lots of
    twigs and sand in the ice. You can play the game anywhere there is refrigeration
    and aircon. I use to play at the old Sky Rink in Manhattan which was on something
    like the 17th floor, 33 between 10th and 11th. \r\n\r\nGo Canucks!\r\n\r\np.s.
    As the story goes Bobby Hull invented the curved ice hockey stick when one day
    after practice he put his wet stick against a heater and it caused the blade to
    curve. I use to try to curve my own stick by soaking it then wrapping it with
    tin foil and putting it in the oven. This unfortunately makes the fibreglass tape
    on the blade come loose. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

    my table hockey and I had all the cards of all the players. But I was to be damned
    if I was gonna go out and get more just to be complete to the last of Charlie
    Finley's California \"Golden Seals\" or the dreadfully small but slow Penguins.\r\n\r\nUnless
    you consider the hammer throw as tossing an on-curve and off-curve point as far
    as you can, I think hockey is about as close to type design as you can get. Don't
    you?"
