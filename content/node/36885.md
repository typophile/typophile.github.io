  been generating fonts for my own use which is fine, but now I find myself needing
  to prepare fonts for other people to use in different languages and on different
  platforms.\r\n\r\nIt seems like OpenType should be the most universal format, right?
  (I'm going through the FL manual, trying to figure this part out) And is there a
  different encoding I shuold be using to prepare fonts for Spanish/Basque language
  for use on PCs? (They say that they can't acccess some accented/special characters
  in the font files I sent them.)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    Is it plugged in? Is it turned on? Many years ago when I worked for a computer
    company, they found that 40% of their service calls were taken care of simply
    by asking these two questions. Likewise, maybe you should ask "them" which font
    format "they" are currently using, and how "they" access the characters.'

    Being unfamiliar with the PC platform, what is the usual way to access accented
    characters?\r\n\r\nI also seem to have a problem in CS2 when generating different
    weights of a single opentype family. The first application I use the fonts in
    has access to all weights, but any subsequent CS2 applications only have access
    to a limited number of weights. Has anyone experienced this before?"

    use the ALT key and the numeric keypad: ALT+0193 = \xC1 through ALT+255 = \xFF.
    However, it's likely that your Spanish-language clients are using a <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/keyboards/kbdsp.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Spanish keyboard</a>, and have direct keyboard access to the
    accented characters. Mousing over the various keys on this interactive layout
    will give you the Unicode desginations for the letters; just make sure in FontLab
    that your accented characters' Unicode match the layout numbers."
