  worrying about it&#34; and focusing on the single-story versions in your handwriting?
  <BR> <BR>2&#41; In Sans faces:  should the two forms ever be mixed &#40;double-decker

    <BR> <BR>Mixing: <BR>The various combos are pretty common, except for having a

    Depends. But generally bi-s are like spinach: funny taste, but good for you. <BR>

  body: '1. No. I have no memory at all of my first consciousness of the difference
    between the single- and double-storey a and g. I have no memory of ever having
    a problem with the distinction. However, I learned to read quite late &#40;around
    seven years old&#41;, and I suspect most of the books I competently read first
    used the double-storey versions. By the way, there&#39;s something to be said
    for learning to read after one has developed a reasonable vocabulary: one gets
    to start with much more interesting books. <BR> <BR>2. Yes. I think there are
    very few non-italic typefaces in which the single-storey a looks good, while the
    either version of the g can be used much more liberally. Frutiger is a good example
    of a typeface that very successfully matches the double-storey a with the single-storey
    g, but there are very many others.'

  body: 1&#41; I remember loosely that I thought of printed letters as doing things
    that handwriting couldn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t. It &#40;the bi-level &#39;a&#39;
    and &#39;g&#39;&#41; just seemed like another weird no-reason rule of Life that
    I needed to know and not question. I was a very passive kid. However, it did seem
    to make a little sense, since I remember thinking the same thing about serifs.
