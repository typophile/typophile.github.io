What typographic treatments lend themselves for effective heavy metal-ness? <BR> <BR>Feel free to post examples, or throw out ideas.

		<div class="commentbody">One thing comes instantly to mind. (the obvious first, right?)&ndash; Headbanger's Ball &ndash; The &quot;gnarliest&quot; black letter you can find &ndash; and less rotunda-schwabacher shapes more textura-fraktur &ndash; the more mediaeval the better. or on second thought what about more of an &quot;einsturzende neubauten&quot; approach?  <BR> <BR>are they heavy metal ala WASP/Judas Priest, Poison/Ratt, Motley Crue/Can't think of one, Black Sabbath (60s 70s)/Blue Oyster Cult/Led Zeppelin?  Seems to me the Speed Metal bands were always a little more &quot;evil&quot; in their &quot;look&quot; while heavy metal bands seemed to have their tongues more in their cheeks. I might look at the early seventies stuff &ndash; Zep, BOC, Black Sabbath</div>

I go crazy with the red). <BR> <BR>* (840K) <A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/wat.jpg" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/wat.jpg">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/wat.jpg</a></A> <BR> <BR>Anyway, shapes like the ngao (those spiky things at the edges of roofs), but certainly the atmosphere of Siam (to use a now-politically-incorrect term) inspired me immesurably. Take a boat on the big, filthy Chao Praya, and you'll feel the &quot;cockroach crawling up your spine&quot; - to use an Armenian expression. It all feels *real*, unlike so much in the West these days. Anyway. <BR> <BR>BTW, in my Daam Entity, Brutaal is the original concept, but Cristaal was actually made into a font first, and then Domination Available (a name taken directly from an ad I saw in Thailand) was the lurid climax, so to speak. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

From where I sit, as a designer, it would be best to always keep in mind the originality ,or lack thereof, of a logo I might design. However, it would do my boss no favor to spend more time than has been allotted per logo. So, if the client's budget is roomy enough for new type, then I would be nuts not to go that route.

		<div class="commentbody">tiffany, budget is most certainly an important issue here but more important is the integrity of the client and designer. the fact is that with experience, custom display type and letterforms are really not that hard to produce. it takes a little while to become accustom to it but it is not very difficult. as a matter of fact, i just finished up a trademark for a client and it took no more then 20 minutes for one mark. trust me, i've taught many students these same skills. it's just a new way of working and seeing typography. you need to remove yourself from the computer for a few rounds. after a few revisions by hand, you can then move to the computer. the trick really is producing a couple of unique letterform directions that speak to the client and then focus your time on the pictographic elements. this is really no different then how you would approach a trademark while using a text face. the difference is the time you would spend putzing around your type collection is spent producing letterforms that do a better job of describing your client in the long run. this is only one of many reasons why you should use custom letterforms. another is the fact that you can work out all the strange and interesting relationships between individual letters more fluidly. a text face can't do this as well. it's letter combinations (except ligatures) are utilitarian. they need to work well with all other letters in the alphabet. the fact is that they don't always do such a great job of this. custom letterforms work in and around each other accenting and stressing or pairing and differentiating with fluid ease. this is why most of the best marks in design were produced in an era where designers could not be lazy. their only option was to produce trademarks by hand. in most cases if you could not do this you had trouble even pursuing a career in design. the computer has really not made this any easier. it has only illustrated the point that a text face is not a display face. <BR> <BR>nad x, i'm glad you agree. but the fact is that even with so many text faces to choose from, a text face is still not a display face. realistically though, most people producing and using type are not very type literate and many of the cheesy &quot;typefaces&quot; out there, are in actuality display faces. if you have trouble producing your own type, many of these faces can work with some proper optical adjustments. these sorts of faces can also provide great inspiration. although i would never purchase a &quot;typeface&quot; from t-26, they do in fact have many creative ideas in regard to unique or interesting letterforms. my suggestion is to use these as creative inspiration but not as a final design for a client. as far as the nike mark is concerned don't give it to much credit. the spacings between the &quot;n&quot; &quot;i&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are way to small. that said, the fact is that this mark was most likely done in the way i have described. the version you are speaking of was designed prior to the computer revolution. just because a mark looks simple does not mean it's execution was simple. masterful works usually only look simple. <BR> <BR>as a last note (i think i already mentioned this) the use of the word logo is incorrect. logo is short for logotype. a logotype is a word mark. most trademarks are not just word marks. the correct term is trademark with the appropriate abbreviation being mark. this is more then just semantics. it's like calling a bicycle a car. though both are forms of transportation a car is very different from a bicycle. <BR> <BR>sorry for the long post&hellip;  <BR> <BR></div>

T-R-A-D-E <BR>This is not a coincidence. <BR>The word trade appears in the word trademark to signify that the mark exists in a context related to trade. <BR>In many countries, you can even register your trademark, so that no-one else can use it to trade with. <BR>Music, in common with many activities where an identifying symbol may be appropriate, is not always related to trade. <BR>Therefore, trademark is not always the correct term for an identifying symbol, especially in cases where (as in this thread) the symbol is not being designed for an organisation primarily concerned with trade, or a purpose primarily concerned with trade. <BR> <BR> <BR>2.Where you did not respond directly (or otherwise) to what I said: <BR>&gt;&gt;not unless you can give us all another applicable example or replacement for the word trademark.  <BR>I pointed out the error in your directive that the correct term is 'trademark' - I said that this wasn't always the case. <BR>In what way does that place upon me the obligation to come up with a term that will be correct in all situations? Jay, just use terms where they are appropriate, and if one doesn't exist, try stringing a few words together to get your meaning over. <BR> <BR>&gt;&gt;you might be getting a little over zealous. long ago i used to listen to punk rock and heavy metal and i fondly remember wanting to believe that there was some high and lofty artistic value to the music because of it's pseudo elitism (the more obscure it is the cooler it is). <BR> <BR>Maybe you were talking to someone else here, can't work out what it has to do with me. <BR> <BR>&gt;&gt; you said &gt; Gutterb</div>

		<div class="commentbody">steve,  <BR> <BR>1. as a matter of fact, music labels, bands etc. offer a product that could be classified under trade. so the term trademark still holds here. almost everything that you can legally trademark has a trademark. <BR> <BR>2. trademark is in fact correct. so my question still holds. if it is not a trademark then what is it? it's sure as hell not always a logotype. though the argument could be made that most bands do in fact use logotypes or word marks. <BR> <BR>3. i took you statement &gt; &quot;Gutterb</div>

		<div class="commentbody">bj, are you kidding me&hellip; i'm amazed that you would pose such a ridiculous question. but to answer, i think you're completely missing the point. no typeface can account for every individual letter pairing possible. this alone should be enough to answer your question but i will go further. because it is really much larger than this.  <BR> <BR>it really is less crucial that the type is unique in its letterforms (though important, this is only a side benefit). there are plenty of custom or hand done trademarks that use mundane faces like helvetica for instance. because they are done by hand means they are done with a keen sense of artistry, with emphasis placed on the letter pairings found in the word. the time spent crafting each letterform in it's relation to other letterforms pushes these marks into a realm that no type set text face can match. the importance of doing marks by hand goes beyond originality and into craft. it's the fine crafting of each letterform into a piece of display type.  <BR> <BR>this craft is also about not being lazy. typographers of the past knew many things that we are losing today due to ignorance and computer convenience. the more you discard your craft and treat it idly the more standards of excellence we lose, and the bigger the onslaught of ignorant graphic design hacks we create. if creating a trademark is as simple as turning on my computer and typing out something in a text face, than everyone with a computer and one hundred free typefaces is a graphic designer. all you are doing is making this paradigm more and more acceptable. <BR> <BR>you may think i'm an idealist but we should all be maintaining these standards. their implementation helps guarantee that we all have jobs.</div>

A degree of wandering from the topic is one thing but this is getting silly. <BR> <BR>As briefly as possible: <BR>Trademark is not <i>always</i> the correct term, esp. when trade is not the primary purpose. <BR>In cases where trademark is not the correct term, logo may or may not be the correct term. <BR>&gt;&gt;webster is progressive <BR>Yes and Oxford about as staid as they come, but both accept that logo is not restricted only to type. Oxford even goes so far as to suggest that logo isn't always an abbreviation of logotype, but can be an abreviation of logogram etc. <BR> <BR>BJ &gt;&gt;Steve is not incorrect in his Gutterball/they construction.  <BR>BJ, I don't think Jay(W) has that in mind as the error. <BR>I think that's too subtle - he just hasn't read the words properly, or he hasn't grasped the idea of saying 'this <i>may</i> be the case BUT I don't think so'. He's a serial misinterpreter, I think he uses miscomprehension as rant fuel or something <BR> <BR>OK, that's enough. <BR>Jay(W), answer this however you like, you tempted me into a reply before, I already wish I had gone with my instincts and ignored you. <BR> <BR>Now, having used up lots of this thread on nothing, I'm going to give some more thought to the original question - 'What typographic treatments lend themselves for effective heavy metal-ness?'</div>

It morphs and is really controlled by common usage amongst the masses.  <BR> <BR>Today, in everyday conversation, the common term for any mark that is used to ID a product, person, company, etc. is 'logo'. People also use wordmark, trademark, logotype, bug, icon, etc. <BR> <BR>So while your historical definition has merit, it really serves no purpose to debate its use in every day language. <BR> <BR>Except for sounding elite in client meetings and/or gaining from the enjoyment in partaking in silly debates online ;o) <BR> <BR>As for using custom type for every client, if you can do it, and feel that it is so important, then more power to you. <BR> <BR>Custom type is often a great solution. That said, there are a lot of great typefaces out there that make great raw materials for a logo/logotype/trademark/whateveryouwanttocallit <BR> <BR>Personally, I don't side with either argument&hellip;it all depends on the needs of the client, budget, timeline, etc.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&quot;Logo&quot; is defined generally as: <BR> <BR>&quot;A distinctive name, symbol or trademark of a company designed for easy recognition. [ &lt; LOGOTYPE.]&quot; (American Heritage Dictionary, Third Edition) <BR> <BR>As &quot;logo&quot; is derived from the word &quot;logotype,&quot; it's important to know that a logotype (in the context of a piece of type) could be a trademark, a stamp, a word, phrase or ligature set in a specific proprietary or nonproprietary typeface. Logos were often made into a single piece of type, hence the term &quot;logotype&quot;. In modern usage, even a proprietary color used in a distinctive way can in some cases carry the effective and legal force of a logo in identity systems. Proprietary fonts are often employed in this manner as well. <BR> <BR>The Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), for example, often omits its famous &quot;eye&quot; logo in printed or broadcast advertising when it would conflict with the design of the piece, instead relying on its use of Didot or other identifying elements to reinforce its corporate identity. (Philip B. Meggs, A History of Graphic Design, Second Edition, 1992, p. 381.) <BR> <BR>Here are some of Paul Rand's ideas on the subject of logos, taken from his book, &quot;Design Form and Chaos&quot; (1993): <BR> <BR>&quot;Here is what a logo is and does: <BR>A logo is a flag, a signature, an escutcheon, a street sign. <BR>A logo does not sell (directly), it IDENTIFIES. <BR>A logo is rarely a description of a business. <BR>A logo derives its MEANING from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around. <BR>A logo is LESS important than the product it signifies; what it represents is more important than what it looks like. <BR>The subject matter of a logo can be almost anything.&quot; (p. 56. Parentheses and emphasis in original, uppercase substituted here for italics in original.) <BR> <BR>&quot;A street sign is a kind of logo. Trying to locate an unfamiliar street that has no marker is a bewildering experience. Whether the sign is beautiful or ugly, serif or sans, only the name matters. A logo and a street sign have this in common</div>

The dictionary says elitism is &quot;The belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority, as in intellect, social status, or financial resources.&quot; <BR> <BR>So I can't agree with you. Just because you believe your better than someone doesn't make it so and certainly shouldn't be what defines you as a graphic designer. <BR> <BR>Having elite skills at graphic design, well, sure&hellip;that's a good thing. But elitism is just plain arrogance. <BR> <BR>And why in the hell did you dig up a year old post in the first place? (And why does a55hole get blocked but assholes doesn't?&hellip;and isn't this thread much more entertaining if we discuss the ways the naughty-filter works instead of the definitiion of logo and if Jay is an a55hole or not?&hellip;and why am I writing like a script-kiddie?&hellip;and did I spell 'script-kiddie' correctly?)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">wow&hellip; there's way to much here to even respond to. i'll hit the big topics and try to keep it short. <BR> <BR>on the issue of &quot;logos&quot;:  <BR>1) it's a low brow term. that does not mean that logotype solutions themselves are low brow.  <BR>2) just because the dictionary has adopted the incorrect term and defined it does not mean it's correct. many notable identity designers would agree. <BR>3) paul rand was producing work when the abbreviations &quot;logo&quot; was coming to power as a word. this does not make it a correct term either. <BR>4) i do agree that it has become a common term though and that is the reality of it. i don't chastise people over it only people that should know better. my effort was to expose the reality of the term. i think you guys are way to entrenched in an improper blanket term. <BR> <BR>on the issue of elitism: <BR>1) elitism is a beneficial element in culture. it creates high standards. it's there and will never go away. our industry (design) is based on it. get used to it and learn to embrace it. <BR> <BR>on the issue of insulting people: <BR>1) most of the statements i make sound outlandish because they are. most of them are written as jokes with some truth behind them. in the written language they come across with little humor. i'm sorry for that. most individuals i know, in person, who read these posts laugh. it's humorous how up in arms you guys get. <BR>2) steve, you are still incorrect. the statements you have listed are very general and site no one individual, directly. i have only reverted to name calling twice. and i've admitted to it when doing it. it is a weak way to debate. <BR>3) if some people in general feel insulted that is their own perceived and individual problem. people need to toughen up. i can't believe how sensitive you are being. you'd have a hard time living in places like NY. <BR> <BR>on the issue of using lowercase: <BR>1) it's more efficient while typing and is a modification to the written language. it omits what i consider to be little needed formalities. it is a push toward utilitarianism and minimalism. my doing it is expression of these ideals. david, would you insult wim crowel for his new alphabet because it has no caps? your attempt to discredit through what you perceive as technical inconsistencies is one sided. <BR> <BR>on the issue of posting to this thread: <BR>1) i found the title interesting. i grew up listening to punk rock and heavy metal. <BR>2) i was shocked by the typographic practices with in it. i think it's in bad taste and sets a bad example to people learning this craft. to see professionals practicing in this manner sets bad standards. <BR>3) i couldn't help it i had to say something. i'm sorry my initial post came out to strong. i was mostly joking. but i don't apologize for it's honesty. these sorts of practices are bad for the craft. they make it seem ok to be a lazy typographer. i stand by this. <BR> <BR>on the issue of my class: <BR>1) it is going well, thanks for asking<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> the class is full every term so much so that i have to ask students to drop. the students have given it amazing reviews each and every time. as a matter of fact i've never seen a bad review. if it were as awful as you are suggesting simon, the school would have been alerted to my offensive and outlandish behavior and never asked me to return. that is obviously not the case. <BR>2) the principles i teach are sound. they are a benefit to the industry establishing standards that are very important for young designers. laziness is not permitted and i'm surprised you don't feel the same. <BR> <BR>i still think this has gone on to long. i've done nothing to damage design here. i've brought up important standards that we should all be striving for. these forums should be an attempt to rise out of hack-dom. not submit to it and defend it. my initial joke of being ashamed has sadly turned out to be true. i would have expected higher standards here.</div>

Here's hoping&hellip; <BR> <BR>&quot;laziness is not permitted and i'm surprised you don't feel the same.&quot; <BR> <BR>When did I become an advocate for laziness?

		<div class="commentbody">darrel, i'm enjoying the debate as well (slow on this end too). i think everybody is secretly. <BR> <BR>i feel i've done a pretty good job of outlining elitism in design in many of my posts to this thread. but i can do it again. <BR> <BR>our world is one of hierarchies. i don't always love this i just accept it. i think you guys have misunderstood this or i haven't expressed it clearly. these hierarchies are alive and kicking in all human endeavors. what makes you think design is any different? what makes certain designers better? are they in fact &quot;better&quot; on some rudimentary level? or is it simply the opinion of a large segment.  <BR> <BR>what makes you a designer and not your client or your mom? you have a better skill set, training, sense, eye or whatever. the fact is that you are casting yourself into a position based on hierarchies. <BR> <BR>design is subjective. it's all opinion even the few concrete issues in design like legibility are opinion (though i doubt anyone here will admit it). legibility is the kosher opinion we can all throw around and take no heat for. because design is based on opinion it becomes subjected to elitism. it's a world of cool. we create cool or pander to it in most of what we do. the world of cool is one of the biggest realms of elitism. cool runs rampant through the industry.  <BR> <BR>this is the reality of the industry and i find little need to debate it. what would be an interesting debate though, would be, is elitism positive or not?  <BR> <BR>i pose the argument that a healthy dose of it is very good. it establishes high standards that allow some to excel and others to parish. this is the natural order of nature and the world. there is no need to fight it just join the game and enjoy it. take a strong part in it. high standards are what guarantee that you have a job. they make you the designer and not your client or your mom. wouldn't that be bad.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">darrel, <BR> <BR>&gt; That's not really how we should perceive ourselves (or how any industry should perceive themselves, other than maybe royal families or evil dictators.)  <BR> <BR>i think it's a knee jerk reaction to vilify elitism. there are many elitists who are healthy happy friendly people. elitists are not evil fascists. <BR> <BR>i'm talking about design generally which applies to graphic design as well. design is subjective in general and in it's details. can you think of an area where it's not (without reverting to the typographic legibility line)? <BR> <BR>&gt; Maybe I'm not understanding your definition.  <BR> <BR>i guess this is part of the problem. with elitism can come arrogance, rudeness, etc. but not necessarily. not all elitists are arrogant. but most are. all good things have bad things about them and all bad things have good things about them. i'm just focusing on the positive elements of elitism. <BR> <BR>emotionally no one likes being talked down to. but when it happens to you or you're placed in that position it pushes you in one of two ways. 1-you make changes in yourself and strive for something higher. 2-you do nothing. this is illustrated well in school. there are those that fight the elitism found with in and remain ignorant. then there are those who rise to the challenge and learn new things becoming elitists themselves. our american society today is too quick to try and deny social hierarchies and elitism because it's not p.c.. i think most all the great things in culture owe themselves to elitism. art, design, typography are just a few of them.</div>

It is also possible to know with strong conviction that you have successfully answered the clients problems through your design without being elitist about it. <BR> <BR>I think perhaps what can be said is that designers do need humble confidence, not arrogant pride. <BR> <BR>Here's a good quote for you: <i>Elitism is the subconscious assumption that worthy persons must be built up, and unworthy persons must be degraded.

		<div class="commentbody">hector,  why'd you read this thread and then waste even more of your time posting to it?  look at the top of your browser there's a back button. <BR> <BR>here are a couple of parts from a few reviews i thought some of you might be interested in. it's for a book by William A. Henry, titled &quot;in defense of elitism&quot;. <BR> <BR>Published prior to the crescendo of criticism against affirmative action and related programs, William Henry's new book suggests an interesting interpretive framework. Put off by the excesses that result from extending good causes to the extreme, Henry focuses attention upon the dialectic between elitism and egalitarianism since World War II. In his view, egalitarianism has triumphed, thereby eliminating the creative tension between the two that fuels progress in American society and culture. To quote him, &quot;the positive side of egalitarianism, the will to tolerance, [must be] coupled with the positive side of elitism, the intellectual suppleness to tolerate and accept diverse elements in society while holding firmly to one's own values'&quot; to sustain the balance (194). With no check on its egalitarian tendencies, American culture loses the capacity to distinguish or to judge among alternatives. <BR> <BR>William Henry was a two time winner of the Pulitzer Prize (once for reporting, once for criticism) and served as Time Magazine's culture critic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jay: <BR> <BR>All of that might have been appropriate under a topic of &quot;elitism in design&quot; or something such. But this thread has gotten so far off topic as to be laughable. <BR> <BR>Further, when anyone calls you on a point, such as justifying your definition of &quot;logo&quot; vs. &quot;logotype&quot; &ndash; based only on your stated opinion against my three definitions (dictionary, historical context and Paul Rand's description), you rather deftly change the subject rather than meet the challenge. <BR> <BR>This thread was about Heavy Metal Typography, but you have subverted it along a twisted path of rudeness, pseudo logic and unsubstantiated assertions. <BR> <BR>Hector's point is well taken. I, too, am tired of this. Hand drawing a logo for a heavy metal garage band will hardly have any effect on &quot;the problems that continue to plague American society.&quot; Your shifting of the discussion to a defense of elitism and its effect the work ethic in the world economy is simply a bizarre attempt to justify your rude, insulting, unwarranted and rather ludicrous holier-than-thou original post. <BR> <BR>If anyone cares to review the entire thread, it's rather humorous to chart the twists and turns Jay has taken to avoid answering for himself, especially taking into account the original purpose of Jared's first post. <BR> <BR>I doubt that Jay would accept such poor argument development (and run-on logic) in a paper by any of his students.</div>

In terms of his views on the state of contemporary society, Henry was a just a tired old hack with no more authority than the guy in the pub. <BR> <BR>Much more accomplished theorists than Henry have defended elitism, and much more accomplished theorists heve denounced it. Surely from your own elitist position, you would have to rate the opinions of these trained and talented professionals above the rantings of an ill-informed amateur hack. <BR>(Although, you hold your own opinion on the definition of common words as a higher authority than any dictionary, so maybe I should expect you to value Henry's views above anyone else's). <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>To post these reviews of Henry's book is <b>condescending</b> because you ought to assume that the people reading the post are capable of finding out for themselves what elitism is, without having to be told by you. <BR> <BR>To post these reviews is <b>naive</b>, because it demonstrates that your understanding of political and social issues is based not on an informed appreciation of relevant debates but on the populist rantings of hacks. <BR> <BR>Your naive condescension is <b>unfounded</b> because your post makes it clear that the level of your social and political awareness is several steps below that of many of the contributors to this board, particularly those people who you have aimed your comments at. <BR> <BR>Hmm&hellip;unfounded and naive condescension&hellip;what does that add up to? <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey. <BR> <BR>Wotta coinky-dink! I was directed to this site by a friend in Seattle who's currently also working towards being a graphic designer. We were comparing schools and after hearing gush about her typography class (which apparently was taught by Jay Wilkinson, it was the exact same exercises and the same principles), I was jealous as hell. My typography lessons were a couple weeks doing a letterform and a glossary sheet defining &quot;serif&quot; and &quot;x-height&quot; in an intro to graphic design class. <BR> <BR>So I may not know a heckuva lot about type (but am taking recommendations for New Orleans area classes/schools), but I do know about umlauts. Well, rock 'n' roll umlauts anyway. Where in any other media an umlaut is a symbol denoting pronunciation (or at least that it is a <a href="mailto:foreign-@ss">foreign-@ss</a> word yer looking at), in R 'n' R it simply means that the umlauted band is making claims to RAWK! No pronunciation changes need apply.  <BR> <BR>David Roughs</div>
