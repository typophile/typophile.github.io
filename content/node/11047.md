    you&#39;re making the &#34;fauve&#34; look really work, and some of the stuff
    &#40;like the &#34;t&#34;&#41; is very interesting - but I&#39;d have to think
    about those a bit more. <BR> <BR>For starters, I would recommend making the ascenders
    slightly taller. And your inclination angle is 4 degrees &#40;right&#41;? I would
    go for a nice integer slope, maybe 1/15 &#40;=~3.81 degrees&#41;, so you can manually
    control your slopes during font editing pretty easily. <BR> <BR>BTW, could we
    see a character set? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    also like what you have working here. Did you use the wireframe &#43; brush &#43;
    cleanup technique on this one? My guess is no, but just curious. Also, the slope
    is intended to compensate for backslanting in a semi serif right? While it&#39;s
    balancing nicely now, did you try it a bit less, perhaps half of current? The
    reason is I&#39;m wondering if people will pass over your design because &#34;there&#39;s
    only italics.&#34; <i>On a side note: Hrant, please explain in more detail the
    benefit of having the slope as an integer for &#34;font editing.&#34; </i> <BR>
    <BR>I think some of your spacing issues are coming from the length of your serifs
    on many of the characters in addition to the ear on the g. I&#39;m looking specifically
    at the top of the i, p, n, r, v. Compare the top serif of the n with the top of
    the m. I might even reduce all the x-height, left-pointing serifs to &#40;or slightly
    less than&#41; the current m. This might allow it to be balanced with less sloping.

  body: '&#62; please explain in more detail the benefit of having the slope as an
    integer <BR> <BR>Well, you should use a measurement that&#39;s most convenient
    to work with. Degrees are really an arbitrary unit in digital type design - slopes
    on the other hand have an inherent usefulness. <BR> <BR>For example, let&#39;s
    say that -because of the admittedly established practice of using degrees- you
    want an angle of about 12 degrees. Doing a Tangent on that and then inverting
    it, you get ~4.7, so you would choose 5 &#40;which comes back to ~11.3 degrees&#41;.
    Now that you have a slope of 1/5, you know that for every &#43;5/-5 units you
    move vertically, you need to move &#43;1/-1 unit horizontally. It&#39;s not only
    easier to work with, it reduces rounding issues too. <BR> <BR>BTW, Randy has a
    point about the inclination angle &#40;assuming there will be an italic down the
    line&#41;. If you reduce it&#42; you will have room for more incline for your
    italics. Otherwise you can use the same angle for the italic, but you&#39;ll have
    to make it ridiculously cursive for it to stand out, and you&#39;ll still have
    problems - the main functional distinction of an italic &#40;to a user, if not
    a chirographer&#41; is its slant. <BR> <BR>&#42; But not below 1 degree, or ~1/57
    - or better 1/50, 1/55 or 1/60 for convenience. In practice it seems that any
    slope less than about 1/30 will start getting problematic at smaller sizes. I
    use 1/16 for Patria Italic &#40;and Harrier&#41; - I have a preference for powers
    of 2. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR>Yeah I hear you on the technical side. Nothing says you have to do this yourself
    though. Have you sent Pill to any distributers? They would gladly do it for you,
    might take some percentage points off the royalty but after all, this is supposed

    on what your customers expect. Emigre fonts for example have minimal kerning pairs

    over them. The more you can do the better, but don&#39;t get discouraged from

    tachnical skill&#34; as Hrant did. It&#39;s as much important as the design itself,
    maybe more. As long as you care about spacing good since the early stages of a
    design, you will very likely need minimal kerning. Of course it depends on the
    design, but I would not use automated tasks of the software.'
