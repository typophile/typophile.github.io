  body: my thoughts exactly. the "base" appears to be (to me) Futura, in a heavier
    weight (hard to say exactly due to the amount of extra stretching/slanting). The
    F is not a letter at all, rather a 1 placed over a black box to create the effect
    of a letter. finding the 1 with only that single character will be the chore.

    font having /F and /1 that could fit together so perfectly.\r\nAnd if you have
    a [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/168347/|closer look]], that
    looks not even well drawn to me. But, if you still need something to start with,
    you could take any generic sans of your choice, from Futura, Avant-Garde or even
    Gill Sans, slanting it on purpose. A quick way would be using [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/diamanti-diagonal/|Diamanti
    Diagonal]]."
