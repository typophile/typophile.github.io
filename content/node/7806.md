body: Hi everyone,  <BR> <BR>yes Fontlab is the best font-editor?, but I&#39;m having
  so much troubles with the program. Is it the system &#40;OSX 10.3.6&#41; or is it
  me?, I&#39;m having a legal copy. The people at Fontlab can&#39;t help me much,
  maybe there is someone who can help me?, th last few weeks I cannot start up Fontlab
  &#40;4.6&#41;, the programs starts up but halfway after the message &#39;caching
  ATSUI fonts&#39; the program quit. I&#39;ve tried to start up in OS9 and OSX.  <BR>
  <BR>Anyone knows what the problem could be?, at fontlab they suggested to reinstall
  the system, but that is to much for me,  <BR> <BR>thanks in advance  <BR> <BR>greetings  <BR>
  <BR>zoe <BR> <BR>&#40;I&#39;ve posted this topic also under &#39;general discussion&#39;
  since i did not know there was a &#39;build&#39; section&#41;

  body: Zoe, <BR> <BR>Reinstalling system will not help. Reinstalling FontLab won&#39;t
    help too. <BR>You must disable bad fonts. <BR> <BR>Johnych
