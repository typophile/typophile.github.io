  body: "It's just a regular space -- copy from there. Its encoding as character U+00A0
    makes it 'special' -- and only if the software it is used with <em>does</em> use
    this for what's it been assigned a code point to.\r\n\r\nFairly modern software,
    such as Adobe InDesign, doesn't really <em>need</em> a hardwired fixed space,
    it can emulate its behavior.\r\n\r\nDoes your font license allow modification?"
