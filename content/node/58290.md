  body: 'I took it from a booklet of a poster-festival in Chaumont 2 years ago, and
    the designer who did the posters & booklets & stuff is Mathias Schweizer. He did
    a font called Ikea Black, made out of one piece of furniture. I didn''t find out
    it is a home-made font or not, but I think it''s pretty fat. (by wich I mean:
    awesomely cool)'
