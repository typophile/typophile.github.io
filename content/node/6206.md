  body: Fabio <BR>good work you have here <BR> <BR>in &#34;pico sans&#34; i think
    you should keep the secong &#34;a&#34;, the first one looks like an &#34;alpha&#34;
    to me, i also think that the &#34;v&#34;, &#34;w&#34;, &#34;x&#34; you can make
    more curve, looks to rigid to me. <BR> <BR>in the case of &#34;pico serif&#34;
    i think that you should be carefull with the &#34;j&#34;, it can be confused with
    an &#34;i&#34; at first sight, also i think the &#34;c&#34;, &#34;s&#34;, &#34;t&#34;
    , &#34;i&#34; and &#34;m&#34; looks too small to me, compare to the other letters,
    and &#34;x&#34; is too thin if you look the &#34;w&#34; and &#34;y&#34;, and &#34;T&#34;
    can be a little more wide. <BR> <BR>i hope this could be usefull.........................CG

  body: 'Capeto,  <BR>  <BR>The translation of Pico, in english is Peak <BR>Your meaning
    is:  <BR>  <BR>1. the top part of a mountain that tapers to a point, or such a
    mountain itself.  <BR>2. the protruding bill of a cap; visor.   <BR>3. the point
    of highest intensity, achievement, value, position, or the like.   <BR>Example:
    a stock market peak ; at the peak of her development as a singer  <BR>4. any tapering,
    pointed protuberance or projection.   <BR>  <BR>Here in Brazil, Pico is a slang
    for:  <BR>  <BR>1. Illegal graffiti in big Builds  <BR>For example, see this Pico:  <BR><a
    href="http://www.pixegraffit.hpg.ig.com.br/predio_arsenal.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.pixegraffit.hpg.ig.com.br/predio_arsenal.jpg</a>  <BR>  <BR>2.
    Very good PARTY or very COOL place!  <BR>For example: Ipanema in Rio de Janeiro

    I think there&#39;s more brazilian guys around here than americans, btw try to
    keep your IM online man <BR> <BR>Remember a year later or so, when we talked about
    make a new pixel serif, and I showed to you my &#39;little son&#39; ??&#40;the
    pic right here below my name&#41; .. So, here u are, with your first baby .. congrats
    pal, it looks great. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t wait to see how will u fit the serif
    caps &#39;M&#39;, &#39;Q&#39; in a 9x6 grid .. It will be a though work !  <BR>
    <BR>Some draws in Pico Sans and Serif looks as the same IMHO &#40;like low m,
    n, r, q, z&#41;. I think u can work better on these ones. <BR> <BR>So, this is
    it. When u updated Pico, post here ASAP, I would like to see how are u doing.
    see ya

  body: the text sample looks nice, the double-s is  <BR>better now and the curve
    &#34;w&#34; is more coherent. <BR> <BR>but i think the ascenders&#39; and descenders&#39;  <BR>incoherencies
    should be fixed; for instance, <BR>&#34;d&#34; is the same height of &#34;l&#34;,
    but &#34;f&#34; is 1px  <BR>down. &#34;p&#34; and &#34;q&#34; have descenders
    longer  <BR>than &#34;g&#34;. imho, ascenders&#39; and descenders&#39; <BR>height
    should be the same for all characters. <BR> <BR>also, the &#34;t&#34; could be
    reduced in 1px. <BR>and the dots in &#34;i&#34; and &#34;j&#34; could be bigger
    <BR>and higher. &#34;j&#34; could be widened in 1px too. <BR> <BR>the &#34;S&#34;
    and &#34;f&#34; on the title are much better <BR>than the ones shown in the settings.
    <BR> <BR>and finally, i think most of the uppercase still  <BR>needs some work...
    most characters look narrow <BR>to me. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;&#62; <BR>sim, tenho
