  touring Europe and producing a TV show of weekly episodes released on it's own YouTube
  channel. I will spend one week in a region of a country trying to uncover a hidden
  treasure. I mean by that, an artist, someone who perpetuates a very old tradition
  or someone who has a peculiar passion. The uniqueness of the show resides in the
  fact that I will not visit any cities and will focus exclusively on tiny villages
  and the countryside.\r\n\r\nI am now building a website (that will later link to
  a Kickstarter page) using GoDaddy's website builder. So far it is perfect for me
  who possesses zero knowledge in programming.\r\n\r\nAnother area where I have zero
  knowledge is in design, thus this post.\r\n\r\nWhat would feel right, font-wise,
  for the tour's website, keeping in mind that my show will be light, warm and familiar?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  would it be a good idea to go for a pair of fonts or stick with one and utilize
  an all caps version for titles?\r\n\r\nMy budget is very limited, so I can't lie
  and would love it if your suggestions rely on fonts included in Windows ;) \r\n\r\n******\r\n\r\nI
  would like to take this opportunity and ask you about choosing the official colors
  of my projects. I don't really have a preference except that it should be a choice
  that reflects the three qualities described above.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nPhil\r\n"

    a good text font, and a good harmonious display font for larger sizes.\r\n\r\nBTW
    you don't have to stick to \"system fonts\" \u2013 luckily there are a number
    of good free fonts out there these days (although do be careful of the lion's
    share of bad ones). One great place to look is Typographica's annual round-up
    of favorites... although actually few of those are free. The last two years:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/features/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2012/\r\nhttp://typographica.org/features/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2013/\r\n\r\nColors:
    we're a monochrome crowd around here :-) but hopefully you'll get some good suggestions.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    ghastly.\r\nActually, I don\u2019t discriminate on the basis of color, but Radiant
    Orchid is, IMO, dif\uFB01cult to work with."
