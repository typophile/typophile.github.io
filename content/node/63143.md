  degree. In this year we're asked to work on one 8 month-long project; thesis. I
  would be very appreciative just to hear anyone's thoughts/suggestions/comments on
  my project idea.\r\n\r\n[THE PITCH]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/texting_5821.jpg]\r\n\r\nAn
  exploration of hand communication. It's evident that a large percentage of the world's
  population communicates more frequently via digital devices. This undoubtedly affects
  the shape of culture, language and communication. \r\n\r\nSome of us spend more
  time and effort with the tools to communicate, than with the quality of the communication
  itself.\r\n\r\nIt is my intention to explore all of the ways we communicate manually,
  by hand, with the hopes of discovering an engaging medium to share this information.
  Most likely printed ephemera.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/122154814_462df2f7c6_4700.jpg]\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas or suggestions of what to look for are greatly appreciated!\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "My sugestion is \"far from graphic design\" itself, but if you are going
    to study the world\u2019s population communication via digital devices there is
    a new study (I did not read it...) of the Portuguese author Ant\xF3nio Damasio
    about \"Rapid-fire Media May Confuse Your Moral Compass\". Occording to USC Annenberg
    media scholar Manuel Castells, Damasio\u2019s study has extraordinary implications
    for the human perception of events in a digital communication environment.\r\nMore

    that helps.\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

  body: "Brainstorm rant:\r\n\r\nWell, just make sure the actual thesis posits a question,
    and attempts to answer it. It shouldn't really be an information dump. Don't put
    the horse before the cart. ie. \"I want to do this so I ask this question.\" In
    my experience, the strongest theses have visual component that complements the
    written component. Of course you can do it the other way around, but then the
    thesis ends up being a long artist statement for the most part. \r\n\r\nI think
    your initial idea has a spark. Broadly speaking, well yes, technology always changes
    the way we communicate/relate/engage one another. In what instance is this a good
    thing or bad thing? ex. I'm going to the movies and I want to let someone know
    where I am. Text messaging seems appropriate, right? Ok, now, I want to break
    up with my girlfriend...   see where I'm going?\r\n\r\nThe question ends up being,
    how do these technologies change us, change language, change the communication
    rather than simply stating that they change us. Because that answer is, yes. This
    is the common pitfall in most theses\u2014the \"this, therefore that\" argument.
    Steer away from tautology. \r\n\r\nYou said the phrase, quality of the communication.
    It's worth exploring. But this word is loaded. What is quality in a communication?
    Concise? Explicit? These are things you will have to explain.\r\n\r\nI think you
    have a nice start and plenty of time. Good luck!\r\n\r\nReading material: Amusing

  body: "Thank you Antonio and bleachmilk (especially). Quality of communication is
    an issue that has been playing a larger role in my research lately. Some questions
    along this line are: \r\n\r\n- Is communication 'selfish' in social networking?
    \r\n\r\n- How much of social networking is really mutual? How much of it is just
    entertainment? \r\n\r\n- Does textspeak alienate people?\r\n\r\n- Why do communication
    software tools hinder our creativity?\r\n\r\nMore to come, I gotta run!\r\n\r\nAdditional
    thoughts are welcome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Milward, BDes\r\nOntario College of Art

    with my rambling.\r\n\r\n\"Why do communication software tools hinder our creativity?\"\r\nJohn
    Maeda would probably say that Adobe products hinder creativity. (But I'm not designer-claiming.)\r\n\r\nAnother
    one is: Can social media be sustainable? But more importantly, should it (or can
    it) be?"

  body: "dirtcastle,\r\nYou are quite correct given the information I have provided
    here. Much of my thoughts have revolved around the social aspect of hand communication.
    However, there is a large graphic side to this project, and to date I have a bank
    of provoking imagery in hopes that I'll be able to produce 3-5 great pieces of
    design. \r\n\r\nBut. I posted my idea so that I might also find some advice on
    how to marry the two. I <strong>always</strong> struggle at this step; my mind
    seems to work well in each individual type of thinking (textual/informational
    + visual), but can't quite make the leap from one to the other.\r\n\r\nSo to answer
    your question, I have no idea where to draw the line....I'm an obsessive philosopher
    and a last minute designer. Help?\r\n\r\nbleachmilk,\r\nThank you for mentioning
    Maeda, I saw his book on simplicity a while back and will now check it out. \r\n\r\n<cite>Can
    social media be sustainable? But more importantly, should it (or can it) be?</cite>\r\n\r\nInteresting
    thing to think about. \r\nIt is clear that social media is not a true and healthy
    form of socializing. It will also always require a power source. These two statements
    are loaded, I realize, and require further investigation (so thank you for making
    me think of these answers).\r\nI also need to think about how I can graphically
    relate this back to the hand.\r\n\r\nWill keep you posted, and please I encourage
    more discussion here\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Milward, BDes\r\nOntario

  body: "If this is a design program, I would avoid straying too far into the realm
    of behavioral science. That said, the interesting side of this topic (however
    amorphous it is) is on the social and behavioral side. For example, many studies
    suggest that handheld communication is fueling anxiety in young people and altering
    family dynamics. But any meaningful discussion on those topics requires some hard
    scientific data. \r\n\r\nInstead of looking at how design influences behavior
    (which is more of a behavioral science issue than a design issue), I would suggest
    one of two approaches to this thesis.\r\n\r\n1. Create your own design solution
    to this problem. Identify the shortcomings -- as you see them -- of all the different
    types of communication. And then tackle them with your design. That's not very
    scientific or thesis-like, but it's firmly in the design realm and it would be
    much more than simply re-packaging research.\r\n\r\n2. Make the subject of your
    thesis a graphical representation of the subject matter and/or statistics, and
    then have the writing be about the best way to represent the topic.\r\n\r\nJust
    a few ideas.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Oh yeah, and maybe delineating design from media, because a big question here
    is the role of design in the context of a particular medium. For example, different
    types of handheld phone/computers.
