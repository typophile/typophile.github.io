  body: "Just pasted a 100 x 100 pt square from illustrator, it came out about 152
    units in height Fontlab\r\n\r\nI think its the UPM size I'm using, it multiplies
    everything 1520 / 1000 = 1.52 times\r\n\r\nDo is mean I can not have a custom
    UPM and must use 1000?"

  body: It looks it can be solved by having 1000 as UPM while pasting, and when you
    have all glyphs in fontlab , change UPM to 1520 afterwards....
