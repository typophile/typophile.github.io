  is the diagonal stroke in the \u20187\u2019 or the loop in the \u20186\u2019 called?"

    Or the vertical link in the \u20185\u2019? And how would I begin to talk about
    the various parts of the figure \u20188\u2019 it\u2019s not really something they
    cover in any article on type anatomy\u2026\r\n\r\nAnd for the \u20186\u2019 how
    would you contrast that with the part that descends to form the upper left side
    of the glyph"

  body: "I'd call the horizontal part of the 7 the arm, the \"vertical link\" in the
    5 the stem, and the sections of the 8 the upper and lower bowls (they both enclose
    a counter). \r\n\r\nAs for the 6, the part that isn't the bowl would be called
    the stroke.\r\n\r\n"

    Aziz\u2019 example, of what you think would be appropriate?"

  body: "hmm. I\u2019m not a fan of extending the term \u2018stem\u2019 to anything
    vaguely vertical, as I think it should be reserved for vertical, stressed strokes.
    A few terms already exist\u2014I know the horizontal part of the \u20185\u2019
    is called the flag, but as far as I know nobody has ever named the other numerals\u2019
    parts. Here\u2019s what I came up with?\r\n<img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/dWPfknQwrRLWgq0OU5-KHdIwwPvl-_Be5V9a2OkdLoNcGpxKx9BWP5cyZLNgCPtCaYCaYJP_RYM=w1894-h948
