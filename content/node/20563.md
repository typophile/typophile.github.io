body: "I'm the editor-in-chief of my high school newspaper, The Riverdale Review.
  I'm pursuing a redesign of the paper of the summer, and I've been looking for a
  typeface to be the centerpiece. I've ended up wanting to use <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rsantos/atlantica/\">Atlantica</a>
  by Ricardo Santos as the main display and body face. I was wondering if anyone has
  had any experience using Atlantica, especially in newspaper or magazine settings
  or could recommend similar faces. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nMaybe
  to help you hone in on what I'm looking for: My goal was to replace our use of Times
  with a face that would be somewhat reminiscent of it (transitional, a certain smoothness)
  but more fun and distinctive. I like that Atlantica has strong stroke contrast,
  but not quite like Bodoni or another modern font, and that the lc gives me a mildly
  similar feeling to Times, but the uc feels fresh (it reminds me a bit of cuneiform,
  actually). Also, it's important to me that the face I settle on has a lot of flexibility
  in having small caps, oldstyle figures, and preferably text and display cuts."

  body: For what it's worth, other faces I was strongly considering were Farnham (good,
    but maybe too bluntly powerful), Miller (too much stroke contrast), Veritas (too
    much contrast again), Poppl-Pontifex, and Baskerville 1757.

  body: "This doesn't have all the features you seek but it is a progression of Times,
    I have only used it for some visuals for a newsletter, but it looks good, free
    to try out as well.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/lido-stf/\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Thanks, timd. I have taken a look at Lido STF, but it's more similar to Times
    than I want. Also, as it's lacking too many "features" for me, as I would like
    the face I choose to be able to accomodate my every typographic whim.

  body: "auricfuzz, I have Atlantica (very nice text font BTW) but I haven't tested
    it yet with newspapper/magazine layouts, only for a rock band cd layout. I think
    the best thing you can do is to send Ricardo an email (he's a very nice guy, so
    I'm sure he will reply) and he can help you out on some PDF beta testing for your
    newspaper or magazine settings demands.\r\n\r\nContact him at info (at) vanarchiv.com\r\n\r\nAll
    the best for your project and please share the design with us :)"

  body: Thanks a lot for the suggestion, adriano. That's a really good idea; I'll
    do that when I have a few minutes. I'll put some stuff up once I progress farther
    in the redesign; right now, I don't have anything concrete, only a number of ideas
    that I'd like to implement.

  body: I don't want to be annoying, but does anyone otehr than adriano have experience
    with Atlantica at all, since if I'm going to use it, I'd like to know any benefits/pitfalls
    of it? Thanks.
