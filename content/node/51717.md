  and every year I am thinking if its time I going \"incorprated\" or some such, instead
  of having clients sign me a check in my name, I'd become a company. It'd be for
  side freelance work, as I dont do all that much freelance, somewhere around $4-5000
  a year.\r\n\r\nI am wondering how some of you that have done that like it, as opposed
  to not being incorporated, and what in your view are the pros and cons to think
  about? Lastly, if I were to do this, I know you can do it through a government or
  state website or local gov office, but was wondering if there was a place online
  that handles it specifically for designers needs?\r\n\r\nthanks for any info!\r\n\r\n"

    'n' fall act if you have clients on site.\r\n\r\nIf you are incorporated, you
    will have to take minutes, so that's a bit more paperwork. And, you CPA will probably
    want you to pay yourself a regular amount on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nYou can do
    the papers on line, but I can't vouch for it.\r\n\r\nAt your billing, I honestly
    wouldn't sweat it. Get a DBA and open a business checking if you wan't to be more
    legit."

  body: If you're making $4-5K a year, then incorporating will probably not make that
    much sense for you, unless you expect that amount to spike dramatically in the
    near future. Of course it is true that you could be sued as an independent contractor,
    but the fees you have to pay to incorporate, the amount of paperwork you need
    to do, and the time involved would not be worth it in my book. You probably still
    need a business license from both your city and state, if you haven't done that
    already, even if you're just a sole proprietor -- I don't remember what the cutoff
    is, but when you make over a certain amount you need to legally get a business
    license.

  body: "Hi all, and thanks for your input. Sounds like I my billing its not worth
    it, eh? In the meantime I did do some checking online and from other sources,
    and it lead me to this place:\r\n[[http://www.legalzoom.com/]]\r\n\r\nThey seem
    legit and relatively cheap. It sounds like maybe a LLC might be the best fit for
    my situation if anything? Here is a comparison of the two options\r\n[[http://www.legalzoom.com/business-formations/summary-compare-business-formations.html|Link]]\r\n\r\nstill
    thinking on it. I am going to talk to my tax guy what kind of saving I may or
    may not get from LLC.\r\n\r\nthanks again for the pointers\r\n"
