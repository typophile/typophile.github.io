I wanted to introduce you to a project I am involved in called IBeam. <BR> <BR>Basically last year we started this project as part of Architecture Week here in the uk. We essentially worked with some leading architects to see how they think about type and created a series of fonts based on their concepts. Here are some images of the typefaces.. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/26833.gif" alt="Alsop"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/26834.gif" alt="dRMM"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/26835.gif" alt="feilden"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/26836.gif" alt="formdesign"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/26837.gif" alt="futuresystems"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/26838.gif" alt="hemingway"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/26839.gif" alt="nealhuston"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/26840.gif" alt="perrella"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Chris, <BR> <BR>It seems like an interesting project, but it seems a bit removed from typography. Looking at the process the artists are asked to go through, they seem to be designing 36 bits of square clip-art, which someone else then arranges in visually interesting way. The clip-art may be mapped to a particular letter, but there doesn't seem to be a link between a letter and the particular image it's mapped to.  <BR> <BR>You could draw comparisons to the FUSE project, but in that project practicing type designers (mostly) were given a theme, and they designed a font around that theme. With your project you've asked people with regular jobs (architect or dancer) to design a font somehow related to their job. Your project is interesting; it's just somewhat less typographic than FUSE, which kind of ran it's course anyway.  <BR> <BR>With FUSE most of the fonts had some typographic qualities, an A was supposed to be an A (eve when it didn't look like an A) - this doesn't seem to be the case with your project - you refer to your template as a 'landscape' not a character map, you only allow one case and no punctuation. The person drawing the glyphs has to be reminded not to use color - seems like art is being forced into a font file.   <BR> <BR>That's not a bad thing, but perhaps it explains the lack of discussion.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si <BR> <BR></div>
