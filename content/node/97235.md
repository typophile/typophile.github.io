  \r\n\r\n--\r\nI would appreciate very much if anybody can help with the name of
  this FONT and/or URL or even a very very similar FONT for a Wordpress Theme project
  I'm working on, and after over 1 wk of searching, I have yet to find something so
  recent/stylish or even close.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I can return the favor!\r\n\r\nThank
  you for you're time and help in advance.\r\n\r\nKindest Regards,\r\njayism\r\n@OpenDevs"
