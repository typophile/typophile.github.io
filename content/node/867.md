  Gotthard &#40;quite possibly a ripoff clone&#41;. <BR> <BR>This one is driving me
  crazy, &#39;cause  it keeps belittling me with &#34;Come on now. You&#39;ve seen
  my unique <b>e</b> and my sexy <b>k</b> <i>lots</i> of times. Can&#39;t you remember
  <i>anything!?</i>&#34;. <BR> <BR>I hate that when type mocks me. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/13940.gif"

  body: The font is WTC Thaddeus, designed in 1982 by Thaddeus Szumilas. It was the
    WTC design just before Favrile that I ID&#39;d for you recently, and it shows
    up in that same book by Lawrence Wallis, &#34;Modern Encyclopedia of Typefaces
    1960-90&#34;. Maybe you need a copy of that book to help you with those Brendel
    fonts.

  body: It looks that way, eh? Well, I just found an old copy in very good condition
    and it&#39;s on it&#39;s way &#40;superseded the ordering of the Solotype Catalog
    for now&#41;. <BR> <BR>Until it arrives ... I&#39;ve nailed a couple more IDs
    on my own &#40;Corvinus &amp; Sackers L Roman&#41; and I&#39;m down to seven remaining
    puzzlers. Thanks yet again Mike. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, Robert Wakeman, who made
    that Web page you bookmarked that included a sampling of Favrile, pointed me to
    <a href="http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html" target=_top>Castcraft/OptiFont</a>
    as the source of his copies. They don&#39;t show Favrile online, but an e-mailed
    response states that they have the tyepface in &#34;lots of weights&#34;. For
    your records ... if you care.  &#60;g&#62; <BR><br>

  body: I&#39;m not as surprised that they have it as that you got a reply from them!  I
    have written to them before and it seemed like my e-mail vanished into the void.
    Did they give you any idea what they would charge for the font&#40;s&#41;?  <BR>
    <BR>I would love to know what fonts they have , since they claim to have acquired
    the Solotype Collection. I understand Dan Solo has given up the business. Can
    anyone confirm that?
