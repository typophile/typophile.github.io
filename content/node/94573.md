body: "I tried posting this on my personal blog/site and it crashed in a really nasty
  way \u2014 repairing that is going to take ages. As well as other things.\r\n\r\nThe
  thing is: my girlfriend passed away on July 7, on the 52d day in hospital and care
  \u2014 a second brainstem stroke proved to be unsurmountable (is that a word?).
  I don\u2019t have words for how I feel about this (and somehow I still have to share\u2026).\r\n\r\nSo
  now I am designing cards and ads featuring \u2018her\u2019 font: National Light
  (are you reading this, Kris?).\r\n\r\nMiep Jukkema\r\n1954\u20132012\r\n\r\nwww.miepjukkema.nl
  (that\u2019s still running ok)"
