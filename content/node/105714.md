  I run into a question:\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you know the proper width for each
  glyph?</strong>\r\n\r\nI'm worrying that, for instance, the width of my \"A\" is
  too long compared to other letters. Is there a mathematical way or something like
  that, other than just the naked eye to figure out the correct proportions?\r\n\r\nI'm
  mainly having this issue with the Caps.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    you can look at the widths used by other typefaces, particularly ones similar
    in style to the one you are designing.\r\n\r\nI have a web page at\r\n\r\n[[http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/propint.htm]]\r\n\r\nwhich
    may be useful, particularly if you are designing a conventional text typeface,
    in providing some starting points."

    construction of letters according to the golden ratio, or divine proportion, was
    the correct way to go about it. Others like Giovanni Cresci believed that using
    the naked eye and one's own discretion was better. So there isn't one way in making
    it \u201Cproper\u201D, but I'm sure there are guidelines I don't know about that
    could help you improve your typeface."
