  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Would you have any advice on job search strategy for a professional font developer (15+ yrs of experience)?

Font design community is relatively small and personally I don't know much about it. Is freelancing common? Is technical font support done inhouse or outsourced? Does it make sense to look at large foundries or smaller independent shops? 

The person in question does not design original fonts, she is font technical expert, knows all about font technologies of the last 15 years. (PS Type1, TrueType, OpenType, manual font hinting, kerning, bespoke fonts production, ClearType optimizations)

How do I to makret her services to the world?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Many type designers these days are one-person shops.  Some of them would rather farm out the technical part of the process, like truetype hinting, opentype coding, or even just kerning.  You could possibly market services in that way.  The bigger foundries have staff to handle the technical side and occasionally are hiring. There are a few inbetweeners like Dalton Maag, who have small staffs or hire on a contract basis.

If your person has 15 years experience, why wouldn't she already know the business?</div>

Thank you for timely replies.

The reason she does not already know the business is that she worked on a salary for a well-known (in our part of the world, at least) font shop and never had to worry about getting assignments. Now her company is not in position to employ her full-time, and I suggested that she continues doing work solo.

She's compliling the list of foundries right now.

Apart from networking at ATypI, what would be a good way to reach out to individual designers?

Post an ad on this site.
Get a Facebook and Twitter account for her service
Put up a website with services explained
Join AtypI and TDC and get to know the members.
Attend type conferences and give presentations


PS: I assume her previous employer was probably ParaType?</div>

Yes, they are well known in the west for their Cyrillic type. I have purchased several of their faces, myself. They seem to be the best known type house in Russia from a westerners perspective.</div>

Nick, I don't really know the size of the Russian market (as measured in money), but ParaType is practically the only local foundry. I have a feeling that since all major foundries developed Cyrillic type, there must be a larger market "offshore", meaning outside of Russia. But my friend is certainly not limited to working on Cyrillic type, she worked on Latin and Arabic scripts as well. (and quite a bit of Cyrillic type for big league foundries was developed by Paratype anyway).

>>I have purchased several of their faces, myself. 

Chris, then chances are you have seen some her work already! We just finished tallying up the fonts from ParaType library that she was involved with, and it came to over 40 typefaces.

Right now we are checking with employers to find out which work was under NDA and will be all set.

Will this forum be a right place to post a resume for a review/critique?</div>
