body: I've used bebas on a few designs ( a few web designs and one print application
  ), I do though have issues with how it looks in smaller point sizes. it basically
  looks almost identical to Alternate Gothic 2, anyone have any recommendation of
  other typefaces with the same look and feel? I'd like to find a paid option that
  will actually render/print well in all sizes.
