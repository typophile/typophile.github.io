  of 3D. I would like to compile an inspiration folder of good work in this area--what
  usually comes to my mind is logo work/letterforms--typophile even has a few that
  i've seen.\r\n\r\nany suggestions/links to images would be appreciated. but no faux-3D
  photoshop-type effects or my hair will fall out"

    and letterforms that have that dimensional, at an angle look.\r\n\r\nWhere does
    one begin, in terms of process? How can you preserve the integrity of a typeface
    when turning it this way and that? "
