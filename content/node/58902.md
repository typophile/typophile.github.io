    Gothic</a>  is very similar to avant garde. \r\n\r\n<a href=\u201Chttp://www.linotype.com/472/futura-family.html\u201D>Futura</a>
    is a good font to invest in, in my opinion. I have found it very useful over the

    Slab 703</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\u201Chttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/collections/chalet\u201D>Chalet</a>
    from House Industries has a retro-modern feel to it.\r\n\r\n"
