body: How can I create a sense of harmony and calmness in a piece of typography?!
  I am trying to visually express (typographically) a scene in a film and im struggling
  with the first part (the busy part is easy!). I guess i could use lots of white
  space to create a calm feel but im stuck on my fonts! Would a serif create more
  balance and reflect harmony? Would a sans serif seem calmer? What do people think?
  Any opinions?...

    you posted some of your experiments here for people to comment on. Be useful to
    see what you did for the busy part as well - assuming you want the two to relate.
    What's the film?\r\n\r\nSpas and yoga centers and the like tend to use sans serifs
    for whatever it's worth. Lower case, often tracked a bit. But harmony might be
    easier to convey with all caps so as to avoid ascenders and descenders. Pale blue
    seems to convey calm. "

  body: "Hi Pattyfab- Good Idea I never thought of looking at spas and yoga-might
    inspire me. The film is Amelie and the scene is where she helps a blind man across
    the road. Here is the link if your interested:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0LNGA2hp8\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see tha pace at the beginning differs from the middle section where shes
    describing everything around them.\r\n\r\nIt would be a bit easier if I could
    use motion typography but I cant. I dont have any experimants to show as yet im
    at sketching ideas stage.\r\n\r\nThanks for your input though!"
