  index. There are many, many foreign accents. However, I am having trouble identifying
  all of the keystrokes. I am using Times as I believe it contains most of the accents.
  Does anyone know where I can access a chart or listing of complete accent keystrokes?"

    body: Thanks Alex. I'll give it a try. I'm on OS X 10.4.5. I was trying to use
      the character palette through the menu bar but not having any success.

  body: You have to enable it via the International control panel in System Preferences.
    Select the "Input Menu" tab of the International control panel. Make sure both
    "Show input menu in menu bar" and "Keyboard Viewer" are checked. You should now
    have a menu with a little flag icon at the top. The Keyboard Viewer will be in
    that menu.

    body: "Hi Mark,\r\n\r\nThanks! I did have the Keyboard Viewer open, however, it
      doesn't show me which keystrokes are to be used for particular accents. I need
      to type in this character >> \u015E  (Latin Upper Case \"S\" with cedille).
      I can select it in Character Palette but it doesn't get inserted into my Quark
      document."
