body: "I've been looking for a Neutraface stencil font. House Industries did a refresh
  of this typeface but does not include a stencil version. Was one ever made? I was
  told there was but have not been able to locate it. Apparently, architects favor
  these stencils and often use the number stencil set on their plans.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  could point me in a direction, it'd be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    it.  It's Carbusier not Richard Neutra. My bad. Go back to doing more important
    things now. :)\r\n\r\nCheers"
