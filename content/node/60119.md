body: "I have compiled this list which I intend to include as an *informative* footnote
  or add as an appendix (after deleting a full section dedicated to small \"Small
  type in use\" from my thesis about Compact Typography).\r\n\r\nI am wondering if
  I have omitted any obvious examples or made any errors?  Any filling in of gaps
  and dates might be fun? LOL\r\n\r\nEarly on (c.1500 - 1800), it is ambiguous as
  to what was used for newspaper printing. Terms like 'Oldface' and 'Modern' are more
  frequent. At the moment my only specific early reference comes from Matthew Cater
  confirming that Fleischman\u2019s Bourgeois Roman of 1750 (assumed by me after looking
  at the Enschid\xE9 specimens) was a type used for newspapers. 'particularly a 8pt
  newspaper type of 1745, one of the first for that purpose.' (p.28 Middendorp, J.
  Dutch Type, 2004)\r\n\r\nMy original idea was to represent something significant
  every 50 years or so and discover what the early example actually were that Carter
  alludes to (but doesn't reveal!)...\r\n\r\nI know I have not done it here but please
  include sources of info where possible, thanks.\r\n\r\nFor context:\r\nSignificant
