  body: I don't want to disappoint you, but this looks like it was skillfully lettered
    by hand. I don't think you will find a digitised typeface that looks like that.

  body: "What Yves said. That's an old, nicely-handlettered logo. There are some nice
    friendly new blackletters out there, but they are not condensed, simplified Lombardics.
    \r\n\r\nHey, typophiles, there's a gap in the market: Condensed simplified Lombardic
    caps.  Get drawing and make a new font! Maybe Albion Home will commission it?
    \r\n\r\n"

    some of Dan Solo's nouveau types have a similar feel."
