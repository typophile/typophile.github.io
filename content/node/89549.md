body: "Can anyone explain this muck? Okay, What I think I know...\r\n\r\nOEM - An
  OEM license covers sales to users who are including a font as part of a package
  deal. The fonts that come with Windows OS and Adobe Illustrator. \r\n\r\nWeb License
  - This license covers use of fonts on web pages. The cost is generally deterined
  by site hits.(?)\r\n\r\nStandard License - This is for general usage based on users
  at one location. \r\n\r\nWhat is sub licensing. What license covers phone apps and
  video games. \r\n\r\nAny help unraveling this confusion would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "OEM = Original Equipment Manufacturer, so usually you'll see ISV (Independent
    Software Vendor) do describe companies like Microsoft and Adobe who include fonts
    with their software products. An OEM license might be appropriate to say someone
    making a GPS, a set top box or a phone. \r\n\r\nSublicensing gives the licensee
    rights to further license. So for example you could license your font to a foundry
    giving them sub license rights to license the fonts to other people or companies.
    \r\n\r\nFor a Web license the typical differentiator is the customer's right to
    host the font on a web server in a variety of formats. \r\n\r\nFor games and apps
    you'd be looking at an ISV license, unless your standard license provides these
    rights.  "
