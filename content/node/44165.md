body: "UK magazine MacUser's cover story is <em>Secret Mac sites -- 50 hottest web
  links that will keep you ahead of the crowd.</em> This morning I received a message
  that Typographer.org is in the list. Apparently they moaned that Bald Condensed
  doesn't get updated as often (heck it's been over a year! :^( ). (I've been hunting
  high and low for a copy of the mag but can't find it anywhere in Gent. Could somebody
  please make a scan of the relevant page and send it to me -- I'd really like to
  see that. Thanks.)\r\nI finally managed to obtain a copy of the mag, so it's not
  necessary anymore."
