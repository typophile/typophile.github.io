  the movie \"Event Horizon\" (terrible movie, I know, but I love the aesthetic of
  these shirts). The font doesn't look that complicated, but I'm having difficulty
  matching it up. I have included some photos <a href=\"http://www.yourprops.com/norm-439b28cd36b2d-Event+Horizon+(1997).jpeg\">here</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.propstore.com/img/products/56/eventh-starcktshirt1_1.jpg\">here</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.propstore.com/img/products/56/eh-justshirt1.jpg\">here</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.yourprops.com/norm-488dc87aaacaa-Event+Horizon+%281997%29.jpeg\">here</a>\r\n\r\nSorry,
  thats all I have. Thanks!\r\n\r\nGavin \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Anzeigen Grotesk looks good; the others don't seem to match on the brackets
    (), although it looks like the letters should be a little narrower.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the reply!"
