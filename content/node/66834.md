  body: "Hi Nancy,\r\n\r\nwhat Jan said.\r\nThis might have started out with a font,
    but if so, it has been heavily customized \u2013\_perhaps beyond recognition of
    the potential base typeface. Or, just as well, it might have been drawn completely
    from scratch. Keep in mind that not every letter is part of a font.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are looking for fonts in a similar style, <a href=\"http://sudtipos.com/home\">the
    Sudtipos foundry</a> is a good starting point.\r\nF"

    either find free or purchase! \r\n\r\nThanx for all the help!\r\n\r\nNan"

  body: "I think what a lot of us forget is that lettering like this has been done
    for a longer time than there have been computers, and probably will always continue
    to be. The reason is that an artist can always see potential in a word or phrase
    to do things that express personality, design, or style, that a computer font
    would never be able to accomplish. Even in these days with some remarkably clever
    OpenType designs, there is a limit to the ways you can expect a font to do things.
    There are no such limits on what an accomplished lettering artist can do. [[http://www.calligraphersguild.org/julian.html|Here
    is a link]] to an article by Julian Waters, a skilled calligrapher and lettering
    artist, writing about Calligraphy, Lettering and Typeface Design. There are some
    links at the bottom of it that can take you to more examples of the work of lettering
    artists.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
