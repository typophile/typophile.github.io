  body: Not that it matters, but Lucian was not designed by Bitstream. It was released
    by Bauer in 1925.

  body: 'Woops! I must have misinterpreted the credits in the FontBook. <BR>When it
    says &#34;<b>Bitstream Lucian</b> <i>1990: &#40;Lucian Bernhard, 1928&#41;</i>&#34;
    <BR>it usually means that the typeface is an interpretation designed  <BR>in 1990,
    after an original by Lucian Bernhard from 1928. <BR>If the typeface actually is
    the original by Lucian Bernhard, the  <BR>credits should read &#34;<b>Bitstream
    Lucian</b> <i>Lucian Bernhard, 1928</i>&#34;. <BR>My mistake.'

  body: 1928, huh? Jasper says 1925. I&#39;m not sure which is right, though. I wonder
    if anyone will ever do the other weights and styles. They are kind of interesting.
