  (It can be best viewed directly on their site groupon.com, also I'm uploading a
  version I have here). On the site it appears to be different?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPablo"

  body: That's the original Extra Bold R. Originally, only the lighter weights had
    the gap in the middle of the R, but when a multiple master version of AGG was
    done in the Nineties, the gap was forced into the bolder weights for consistency
    to make weight interpolation possible. Multiple masters failed in the market,
    but the design changes in AGG persist in certain versions.
