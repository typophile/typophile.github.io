body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nI'm happy to announce that we've done Italics for our Foco fonts.\r\nGentle
  angle, slightly narrower, cursive features; great for subtle emphasis on body copy
  and beautiful at display.\r\n\r\nThe italics are long waited and requested a number
  of times, including here at Typophile.\r\n\r\nHope you like it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Foco_ToTypophile_4667.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/foco\r\n\r\n(A
  few samples and details can be seen on my flickr: http://flickr.com/photos/fabiohaag/3214681859/
  )\r\n\r\nCheers"
