  me. ( Thanks Jim!) \r\n\r\nIt has a section it it explaining & extolling the virtues
  of the f 'logotypes' they made available in some fonts: ff fi ffl ffy ffs ffe and
  so on. There are also Diagonal and other difficult letters combinations in Italic
  such as TA FA VA WA; & Va Pa Wa Yo etc.  \r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to
  study this further it seems like the type Museum in Boston would be the best place
  - do you agree?\r\n\r\nHave any of you spent time looking at these things? Obviously
  their main point is to allow for kerning in the most difficult combinations - but
  have you ever noticed anything else? In addition to the 2nd f getting anew height/shape,
  in some cases I think I see subtle shifts in shape in the new letters - mostly it's
  the crossbar of the f getting shorter in some cases. \r\n\r\nWho might remember
  what the decision making process was like & what combinations may have been considered
  and ultimately rejected?\r\n\r\nThanks! "

    He probably could have given you insight into the Linotype ligatures/logotypes.
    (Though you might have gotten a lot more tangents than you bargained for.)\r\n\r\nA
    more practical contact for you might be Larry Oppenberg. He's head of Gal\xE1pagos
    Design, and on the board of the Printing History Museum (which is in North Andover,
    not Boston, btw), and worked in the drawing office at Mergenthaler Linotype toward
    the end. You can still find drawings in the museum with Larry's name on them,
    I think.\r\n\r\nIIRC, these logotypes were only made for a handful of fonts, and
    you would have had to insert them manually, since there wasn't a place for them
    in the magazine. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'm understanding your first questions about
    the shapes. As far as which combinations, I'd be willing to bet that this would
    have been decided on a font-by-font basis. And the decision would likely have
    fallen to the head of typographic development -- which would have been C.H. Griffith
    (until 1949), then Jackson Burke (until sometime in the 60s), then Mike Parker
    (until the early 80s).\r\n\r\nFor the ligatures, obviously there will be separate
    drawings. The telling thing would be whether there were separate drawings for
    the logotypes or whether there were just alternate spacing specs and directions
    for cutting the logotype matrices from the constituent parts.\r\n\r\nI hope to
    be making a research trip to the museum within the next few months. If I still
    remember this question then, I'll try to see if I can dig up any more concrete
    information for you.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

    Exactly!\r\n\r\n<cite>  If I still remember this question </cite> Thank you very
    much! Actually I will be in Boston in Sept and I had an idea that I should maybe
    go & search too. This is a bit far fetched, but maybe we could go at the same
    time... :-)\r\n\r\nI will contact Larry Oppenburg as well.\r\n\r\nI should also
    note that according to the Linotype book I have the logotypes were keyable from
    an 'Auxilary Magazine' - or insertable by hand. When keyed in the 'fr' was on
    the the 'S'. The 'ff' was on the 'V' and so on.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what I
    wanted to know. Thanks very much - as usual!\r\n\r\n"

    magazine, but yes, on Linotypes that could handle multiple mags, I could see substituting
    one with logotypes. In this way, I suppose the logotypes were basically like precursors
    to the Adobe expert set. Gardner will know more about the logistics of their actual
    use. Maybe this time, he'll have the Linotype machine up and running for you.\r\n\r\nLet
    me know if/when you're coming out to Boston. It's a long shot that I could actually
    meet up with you, since it's a bit of a trek (~ 3 hours) for me to get out to
    that side of the state. But hey, you never know.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\nP.S. Note

    least in some sizes. And I'm sure the drawings are there in the Museum of Printing.
    The idea was, I think, that people could use these ligatures for book work and
    get the effect of the original hand set type. \r\n\r\nLarry Oppenberg was wonderfully
    helpful to me as well; he's invaluable for helping you interpret the measured
    drawings. If anybody would know about whether there were general rules concerning
    the formation of ligatures, it's probably Larry, who remembers the practices there
    at Merganthaler Lino. Matthew Carter and David Berlow also worked there drawing
    type back in the day, and several of Larry Oppenberg's colleagues at Galapagos
    Design.  "

  body: 'Eben, just to clarify: since Linotype matrices do not allow kerning, to get
    not only fi, fl etc., but also fa, fo, fe, fu, with a traditional Caslon full
    f, they would have to do logotypes for these that would fit on a single matrix.
    These were done for Caslon Old Face, probably to compete with Monotype for book
    work. I don''t know how often they were actually used, but they are in the old
    specimen book I have. I kind of doubt that this was done much for other Linotype
    faces, but you could ask Larry Oppenberg. '

    What's interesting is that some of them were just for the roman and some of them

    ways as well. I am also not sure that all sizes had logotype available either.
    But I will take your suggestions and follow this up with he folks who will know.
    \r\n\r\nBill, is it your impression that Caslon had the most special logotypes?\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'I don''t know about metal Linotype''s other faces--a large specimen book
    would give you a pretty good answer. I suspect that in the new faces designed
    for Linotype there would have been less motivation to do f ligatures, because
    there was no need to give the feeling of an old classic, which was the goal with
    Caslon. My impression is that for new stuff they tried to design to the limitations
    of the Lino machine, and tried to make a virtue of the limitations--the necessity
    of short tops on the f''s, the need for wide italics. '

  body: 'The specimen book That Jim Rimmer Gave me shows that it was something they
    did with at least 4 or 5 typefaces or more - all text/roman in style. The book
    itself is not complete and it looks like they designed it so that you could ad
    pages to it. Quite clever really. If anybody is interested I can give a full accounting
    of what it shows. So my impression is that while they may have taken Caslon as
    a special case ( or possibly not! ) it is certainly true that they gave a lot
    of logotypes to for instance the Garamond too. '

  body: "Eben --\r\n\r\nI believe, as Bill says, that the full logotype treatment
    was typically done with faces that were targeted for bookwork. Further, the extensive
    f ligatures/logotypes would have been applied primarily to faces that were adaptations
    of older or competing typefaces, where the overhanging f was an integral part
    of the design (and a customer's expectations).\r\n\r\nFor original designs, you
    usually find that the f has been crafted to disguise the Linotype's mechanical
    limitations, and so, extensive f-combo logotypes were not necessary to achieve
    the proper effect.\r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: "These glyphs were called typographic refinements. The punches in combination
    (double hit) were used in order to make one matrix.\r\nBoth Linotype and Intertype
    manufactured these matrices. Because there were no overhangs allowed in linecastng
    machines special \"true cut\" matrices were made but the tracking was not esthetically
    pleasing. Of course Monotype composition never had these problems.\r\nYes, it
    is true that most of the type families that contained the typographic refinements
    were for book composition. Ludlow display mats were also punched with overlapping

  body: "I have looked at the Linotype drawings at the Museum of printing now. And
    what I found was that 98% of the time what looks a little like variation is in
    fact differences in inking, pressure & so on. So Bill, you were bang on in general
    as I think we all knew you were.\r\n\r\nHowever! I did find some nice examples
    of honest to goodness for sure, no doubt, contextual alteration. Part of what
    's fun with the drawings is seeing the original line erased. \r\n\r\nMind you
    - there might be more - but I only had a day. I wouldn't expect to see very many
    more if there are any at all. What I wish I had time to do is to compare across
    pt sizes. This might not be possible in some cases because the special logotypes
    were not always available in all pt sizes. It is even possible that thye only
    exist in the point size in which I found them.\r\n\r\nSo, here is what I found.
    \r\n\r\nJanson 8pt. The far right serif of the W is wider on the Wa logotype than
    on the W. \r\n\r\nBaskerville. 10pt - rf vs sf - the rf combo forces the crossbar
    to be shorter on the left side ( next to the r ). The sf logotype uses a consistant
    s & the basic special f found it in the logotypes. \r\n\r\nCaslon italic 10pt
    - fs vs fr ( also ffr & ffs)  - the fr combo requires a shorter bar again but
    this time on the right of the f not the left.\r\n\r\nGaramond no.3 10pt. fa vs
    fy ( also ffy) - slightly shorter bar on the fy similar to the example above.
    'fa' has a normal crossbar.\r\n\r\nAs I said in my blog; Larry Oppenberg's help
    in understanding the organization of the papers and how to efficiently use the
    resource was invaluable. Thank you Larry! And of course Gardner's giving me the
    chance to do the research was likewise. Thanks Gardner!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
