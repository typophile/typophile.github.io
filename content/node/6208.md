body: "hi! (first post.) I'm typesetting my friend's linguistics masters thesis; does
  someone know, are the SIL series the best [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]
  fonts available? (they're free from:\r\nhttp://www.sil.org/computing/fonts/encore-ipa.html);
  also, i'm always wondering how to pronounce the name tschichold properly, can someone
  who knows try to phoneticize it for me (ok yes my last name is schmidt, but still,
  ich spreche nicht Deutsches)?"

    <BR> <BR>BTW, even though Tschichold did live in Switzerland, I don&#39;t think
    there&#39;s any cheese in his name. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: If Tschichold is a German name, it should be anglicized as &#34;chick-kolt&#34;;
    if you can, pronounce the second &#34;ch&#34; like the one in &#34;loch&#34; instead
    of like a &#34;k&#34; &#40;not all English speakers can do this&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#40;Ich

    3 SIL fonts are available for free minus the upper case and punctuation, the full

    Sans from Adobe also contains many linguistic symbols, and for screen, Lucida

  body: In response to the first question, no the SIL series are certainly not the
    best typefaces out there with IPA characters. For body text, a far better typeface
    than those Times and Courier clones would be the amazing <a href="http://www.sil.org/~gaultney/Gentium/">
    Gentium</a>, which, coincidentally, is also free. For heads and facts etc, there
    is as mentioned Lucida Sans Unicode, which comes bundled with Windows and possibly
    other Microsoft products, and which works just as well in print as on screen.
