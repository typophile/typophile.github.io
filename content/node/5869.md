  body: Yves, when do you go to sleep?  <BR> <BR>You are so fast at these things,
    the only chance the rest of us have is when you don&#39;t know it &#40;rare&#41;,
    or when you are asleep, or taking a break &#40;do you take breaks?&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>Impressive! ;-&#41;

    I usually sleep between 4 pm and 10 pm Typophile time,  <BR>but even that is not
    always certain... The breaks are few <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    border=0> That would be &#34;Belgische vuurpijl&#34;,  <BR>but still an impressive
    display of knowledge of the Dutch language  <BR>nonetheless. Still angling for
    a job at my conscious and  <BR>responsible company, David? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
