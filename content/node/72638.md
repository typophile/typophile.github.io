body: My question is about linked webfonts, (not the web-safe installed fonts like
  Georgia & Verdana). Is it possible to print using them from a browser? I heard Firefox
  was going to implement this, but have not seen it work yet. Was that functionality
  intended for naked font linking only (.otf & .ttf but not .woff) or a rumor wholly
  unfounded?

  body: "We find that support for printing web fonts varies quite a lot by browser
    and platform. If I recall correctly, it works in MSIE, Firefox/Linux and Firefox/Windows,
    Safari/Mac, Chrome/Linux, and Chrome/Windows. It does not work in Firefox/Mac
    or Chrome/Windows. There's a <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=42499\">bug</a>
    open on the last one.\r\n\r\nOthers have <a href=\"http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?locale=en-US&comments_parentId=497167&forumId=1\">reported
    inconsistent results</a>.\r\n\r\nI suspect that another issue that people may
    be running into is web font providers who strip out the post table from fonts.
    Among other tools, font-optimizer does this. The chance of fonts printing correctly
    seems to be much lower when this table is missing. For this reason, the Google
    Font API preserves this table."

    computer to print a web page that links to WOFF fonts, the WOFF fonts have already
    been converted and enumerated to the system as OT fonts. So this should not be
    a problem associated with WOFF.\r\n\r\nI think the rumor that will not go away
    is that the user or web designer can make their browser window or web site, respectively,
    not match the page size of the user's printer quite easily.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    Don't get it.\r\n\r\n@raph\r\n\r\nDo you know if the testing included style sheets
    specifically for print?\r\n(@media print {} in CSS or, as a link tag attribute:
    media=\"print\").\r\n\r\nAlso, \r\n+1 on the post table problem. A known issue.
    Don't mess with the post table - it's asking for trouble.\r\n\r\nrich"
