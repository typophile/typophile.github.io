  for a while, but I don't know nearly as much as those of you... perhaps you can
  help me ID this one, it's Hollister's main brand typeface, best seen on the bottles,
  bags, and boxes.  Variations of it are used on the website.\r\n\r\nThank you in
  advance for looking.  It's my first post to this board...\r\n\r\nDarrin\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1118_01_b_4599.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "There are a lot of differences - note the straight sides on the 'O' (and
    'D' and 'C' and 'G' etc.) in Alternate Gothic, whereas they are curved in Koehler.
    The letterforms in Koehler are a little more crudely drawn (intentionally so)
    while the forms in Alternate Gothic are more regular. Koehler seems to have a
    little bit of contrast, but Alternate Gothic has none. The terminals of Koehler
    are cut at a greater angle than those of Alternate Gothic...\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Yes.  Upon close inspection I see you are absolutely right.  I was looking
    for those differences while you replied.\r\n\r\nThank you so much -- I never expected
    to find out so quickly!  I greatly appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDarrin"
