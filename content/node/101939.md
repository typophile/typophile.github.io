  that have no fully-enclosed counters can be useful (for ease of manufacturing certain
  things). They're like the inverse of stencil letterforms. Kind of like some of the
  letters here: http://typophile.com/node/76578\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/101919\r\n\r\nWhat
  to call that?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    standard typographic terminology for the thing that is not present.
