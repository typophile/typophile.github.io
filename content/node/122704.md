  in Neutraface. Although House Industries tells me that Neutra supports Turkish (http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface/fontfeatures),
  it seems the Fonts are missing the S-cedilla (\u015F). As I\u2019m not speaking/reading
  Turkish, I\u2019m a bit confused.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nV"

    Take my findings with a grain of salt, but some countries/languages use a comma
    accent beneath the S, while others insist on a true cedilla. Others are seemingly
    ambivalent \u2014 regarding it as a matter of style or preference. Font designers
    have been all over the place with it.\r\n\r\nHere's an explanation and a solution,
    of sorts: http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=9"

    s+ cedilla. AFAIK that should cover Turkish. Do you have the current version,
    or are you perhaps using an older version?\r\n\r\nIn any case, if you can't find
