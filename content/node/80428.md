body: "For some reason in Illustrator I'm getting a giant cursor where text is added
  to the top. If you look at the picture you'll see the black portion is highlighted
  text. Despite the huge cursor the leading appears to be perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nI'm
  not sure if this is related, but the ttf is cut off in MS Word and I'm assuming
  my vertical metrics are off...which is at least one of my problems if not both.\r\n\r\n<img

  for my dimensions:\r\n\r\nAsc:  590\r\nDes:  -287\r\nUPM: 1000\r\n\r\nI've read
  the numerous articles about vertical metrics but something must still be off. Based
  on these values can anyone lend a hand on my OS/2 and hhea?"

  body: The Ascender and Descender, as positive values, don't add up to the UPM; also
    check your bbox values.

  body: "Thanks for the reply oldnick\r\n\r\nSo then UPM should be 877 (which I understand
    may give me weird scaling issues?...oh well)\r\n\r\nWhat about the bounding box
    should I look for?\r\n\r\nI see a huge negative value but not sure where it's
    coming from and not sure how to change it.\r\n\r\nFont BBox (-818, -5678) - (730,
    706)\r\n\r\nWould you mind consulting with me? I'm completely lost about the best
    way to go about this and no changes seem to make it work."

  body: Well, it's pretty obvious that the cursor problem is caused by the HUGE negative
    value in the bbox. You may be able to track down the errant point/object that's
    causing this anomaly by selecting the first character in your font (usually the
    exclamation mark), selecting VIEW &gt; ZOOM &gt; FIT, then stepping through your
    characters (CMD/CTRL+]). When you hit the offending character, you oughta know
    it...

  body: Beautiful. Found some pesky dashes hanging around way way down there. Hopefully
    that will fix the issues in MS Word as well. OldNick you are the MAN!
