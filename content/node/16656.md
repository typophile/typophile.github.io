    sure that it is custom, I believe the Independent was redesigned by a Spanish
    agency when it reduced its size, but that the logo predates the redesign. If you
    want close you could look at Nick Shinn's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/walburn/\">Walburn</a>
    or search Didone on myfonts.com.\r\nTim"
