body: "I don't know if people here will consider this to be a valuable resource or
  not, but I had been looking for something like this online before and could not
  find it:\r\n\r\nOn [[http://ibmcomposer.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=54&Itemid=56|this
  page]] just click on \"here\", and you can download the complete portfolio of typestyles
  for the IBM Selectric Composer.\r\n\r\nThese include Aldine Roman, similar to Bembo;
  Journal Roman, similar to Garamond; and of course Press Roman, similar to Times
  Roman.\r\n\r\nThus, one has a list of the most \"essential typefaces\" from at least
  one perspective:\r\n\r\nBembo (imitated by Aldine Roman)\r\nBaskerville\r\nBodoni\r\nCentury
  Expanded (called Century here)\r\nNews Gothic (sort of imitated by Classified News)\r\nCopperplate
  Gothic\r\nGaramond (imitated by Journal Roman)\r\nTimes Roman (imitated by Press
  Roman)\r\nMemphis (imitated by Pyramid)\r\nOptima (imitated by Theme)\r\nUnivers\r\n\r\nOf
  course, the Selectric Composer could only set text, not headlines - for that, you
  could always use Letraset."

  body: Thanks for the link John - remember the Composer well - we used to set whole
    publications with one before computer typesetting.

  body: Ah, the one eventually found to have been designed by Nicholas Kis. No doubt
    you're right; I just went by the fact that it looked like a Garalde, and thus
    assigned it to the most commonly known one.

  body: Interesting "at" symbol in Journal Roman. I thought that was a more recent
    invention.

    cached at luc.devroye.org [[http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-59656.html|here]] - but
    I have even more exciting news.\r\n\r\nA different document, also displaying the
    IBM Selectric Composer fonts, but with better resolution, is available here:\r\n(https://www.box.com/selectric/1/218213190)\r\nas
    ComposerTypeDesigns.pdf . However, it is an older document, and thus does not
    have some of the typefaces from the other one."
