  for Leopard: Helvetica is Dead.</a></strong>\r\nby Craig Swanson\r\n\r\n<em>For
  years, print-based graphic designers and prepress professionals have fought to replace
  certain Mac OS X default fonts with their existing PostScript Type 1 fonts of the
  same name \u2014 [[Helvetica]] being a primary example</em>.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HelveticaGrave_6654.png]"

    to buy a font!</strong></cite>\r\n<cite>We know this solution goes against a long-standing
    tradition of graphic designers not buying their fonts. In an online survey last
    year, half the designers responding admitted they had purchased almost none of
    their fonts. With only 6% saying they had purchased all their fonts.</cite>"

  body: "Yeah, but the basic statement is kinda wrong.\r\nWhy should everyone (that
    is, every OS X user) <em>have</em> to buy a new Helvetica Neue?\r\nThe version
    of Helvetica Neue that ships with OS X is a TrueType version from Linotype. Apple
    only repackaged it as a .dfont.\r\n\r\nAnd why this arbitrary differentiation
    of \u2018creative fonts\u2019 and \u2018system fonts\u2019? As if the latter was
    in some dubious extra file format that cannot/may not be used for screen or print
    design\u2026\r\n\r\nWhy should I have to licence it from Linotype (or Adobe, being
    a reseller \u2013 no?) again? That was paid with the OS X license.\r\n\r\nThose
    who need to work with several versions of Helvetica (Neue) and are afraid of a
    jumble, they need a proper font management. But then, who doesn\u2019t, anyway?\r\n"

  body: "I'm sorry I don't see why I have to purchase Linotype Helvetica fonts for
    \"creative\" activities when the .dfont iteration seems to do the trick just fine.
    Is there something I'm not getting? Is there a quality difference? The only case
    I see the .dfont might cause problems if you purchase additional weights not included
    on your systems and it cause problems... but again I still don't see the point.\r\n\r\nMikey

    a very popular font. Firms that do a lot of big corporate work may be expected
    to work with all the various weights of Helvetica and Helvetica Neue to keep clients
    happy."

  body: 'On the omission of Linotype as a Helvetica source: It''s interesting how
    many creatives and printers <em>still</em> view early digital pioneers like Adobe
    and Emigre as the only sources for professional type. It''s a mindset that is
    particularly prevalent in print shops throughout the U.S.'

    address this myth, but as I recall it takes it to an extreme with Apple getting
    credit for the ongoing popularity of Helvetica, with no mention (?) of Adobe and
    PostScript. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
