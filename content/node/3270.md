  body: Mads, this is very interesting. Not only are you trying to distill the &#34;essence&#34;
    of handwring apparently, but it&#39;s certainly a genial idea to base it on the
    handwriting of <i>many</i> <b>other</b> people! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hi Mads. Nice work. Reminds me a bit of Keedy&#39;s ol Jot face although they
    are not that similar, but I would guess design process is similar. It is excellent.
    H is very unique but fits well with rest of glyphs. A is a bit too angular, although
    form is very nice. Maybe P should have a tad bigger bowl... <BR>Also alternates
    would be ideal so it does not look too computer generated when used.

  body: 'Mange tak Ole. You are definetly right about the alternatives. I&#39;ll have
    a second look on A and P as well. Though I&#39;m glad that both of you are so
    positive towards it, I&#39;m quite surprised that none of you comment on the X
    and Z.. <BR>I&#39;m thinking the X might be a bit &#39;too much&#39;. Of course,
    this would be solved if there were and alternative without the curl. Also, the
    Z doesn&#39;t have quite the right curve yet, I think. <BR>I&#39;ve been told
    that the T, Y and M stands out because they are very straight-legged in proportion
    to the other glyphs. Personally I like that they are a bit &#39;quiet&#39; in
    comparison to for example the X.  <BR>Any thoughts on this? <BR> <BR>Also, Ole:
    do you have a link to Keedy&#39;s Jot face? Is it Keedy as in Jeffery Keedy? I&#39;ve
    tried searching the board and Google, but haven&#39;t found anything. <BR> <BR>Mads
    <BR> <BR>ps. I keep getting an &#39;Internal Server&#39; error and no upload-dialogue
    when I try to upload pictures to the board. Does anyone know how to solve this?'

  body: Mads -- you might try writing everything and then upload lastly. Take the
    text it puts into your email and then paste it where you want it to go. It seems
    to be working &#40;mostly&#41; lately. Unfortunately I haven&#39;t been able to
    figure out a specific &#34;why&#34; to how it happens.
