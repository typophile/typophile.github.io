body: Hello folks, <BR>This is a strange gaelic/celtic/uncial font - some letters
  don&#39;t even look gaelic/celtic in origin to me. It&#39;s not Libra, Omnia, Priory
  or even Karolinger EF. Any ideas... <BR> <BR>&#60;a href=&#34;<a href="http://www.fontfactory.com/font_id/elphoenician1.jpg"

    &#40;except for an internet freebie that bears no resemblance&#41;. Can you point
    me in the right direction?

    the one. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    way! Doesn&#39;t look like you get many folk posting in this part of the forum
    so I reckon I should do my bit to keep your grey matter ticking over. Heck - you
    Typophiles seem to do it for fun &#40;see Pop Quiz threads&#41;. As for the dogs
    bollux - well, who says I&#39;m Australian? TTFN <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
