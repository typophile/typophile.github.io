  mimic the imperfections that ink can lay on paper even when the typeface is near-perfect
  in its symmetry?  &#40;Seems like a good-enough reason.&#41;   <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
  revert to my Lamarckian views on letterform recognition for a moment...  Have people
  gotten used to the [accidental, or at least naturally occuring] roughness of letterforms?  And
  could it be that now they accept these types of contours as the norm and crave them?

  body: Hmm, my dictionary says that &#39;chunk&#39; is a &#39;thick piece&#39; or
    a &#39;corpulent animal&#39;. <BR>So, I guess &#39;chunky&#39; typefaces are more
    about weight and proportions, not asymmetry and roughness. Also, I see that most
    &#39;chunky&#39; faces have wedge serifs. <BR> <BR>Personally, I think some of
    these &#39;chunky&#39; typefaces are too dark. That&#39;s my only complaint about
    them. Of course, some fonts like digital Electra, are too light. But Avance, on
    the other hand, it&#39;s too dark &#40;serifs are too big&#41;. <BR>Smeijers&#39;
    typefaces &#40;Quadraat, Renard, Arnhem&#41; are well-balanced, I think &#40;I&#39;ve
    read books set in Renard and Arnhem FWIW&#41;. He usually makes thick stems but
    the serifs aren&#39;t so big or heavy. <BR> <BR>This is a interesting topic. I&#39;d

  body: I believe that maybe the &#34;clunkiness&#34; you refer to is an attempt to
    add life to digital type. Some think digital types are overly homogenized and
    monotonous--especially compared to the subtle varieties in a letterpressed page.
    Whitman is surprisingly simple &#40;in some ways&#41; and angular at larger sizes,
    but at text sizes the angles blend with the curves and it becomes a very readable
    font. This is true of the roman and italic. <BR> <BR>I think Scala and Tyfa may
    fall into this category as well. &#40;was Tyfa first designed for letterpress?&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Also, I know I&#39;ve at least read about it on Typophile, the Dwiggins
    experimental newspaper font &#40;which is mentioned on the Quetzal post and in
    Mr. Johnson&#39;s Czech link above&#41; does have these qualities. I have a Fine
    Print issue with a sample, I&#39;ll have to post it when I get a chance. Again,
    at small sizes, these features become more subliminal, right? <BR> <BR>

  body: Kent, <BR> <BR>I assumed Chris knew Goudy designed Pabst Col. Fred Pabst of
    Pabst Brewing Company. <BR> <BR>On the other hand many others would not. <BR>
    <BR>But Kent, I am having trouble with the essence of the question in this thread.
    I have developed a theory but am not sure it applies in this case. <BR> <BR>For
    instance, would they call this chunky? <a href="http://lanstontype.com/Jenson.html"
    target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/Jenson.html</a> <BR> <BR>Or Pabst. Pabst
    is obviously a less serious face, meaning it is for display, where Jenson could
    be both. But there has been mention of false inking. For me Pabst is somewhat
    playful on &#34;false inking&#34;, as if Goudy was making fun of bad presswork.
    Although, as we know it probably has nothing to do with that, Goudy cut it in
    hot metal. It is merely playful, nothing serious, nothing that would sound the
    drums from the &#34;inkist camp&#34;. They would blush to use Pabst as an example.
    After all it makes them look ridiculous. <BR> <BR>Also I get confused when anyone
    speaks of &#34;too bold&#34;, or &#34;too light&#34;. Non of this makes sense
    unless in context of a specific use. Some faces simply are light, or are bold.
    Using the word &#34;too&#34; would have value in historical work, in other words
    if a face was light and the revival was much darker, you could consider it &#34;too
    bold&#34;. Otherwise it really does not have &#34;too&#34; much meaning. <BR>
    <BR>Or does it? Which is where my theory may apply.

  body: 'This &#34;digital type&#34; theory is old news. Sturdy &#40;as opposed to
    Chunky&#34;&#41; typefaces such as Scala and Charter were produced in the early
    days of digital, to deal with the exigencies of the new process, in particular
    300 dpi laser printers. Adobe Garamond also addressed the issue. <BR> <BR>A similar
    problem existed in the phototype era: the hairlines of types such as Galliard
    and ITC Garamond were prone to disappear during the production process. <BR> <BR>You
    can even go back to the early 20th century, and look at the problem printers had
    with using the same font on both uncoated and coated paper &#40;where fine details
    were hard to keep right in big print runs&#41; -- and the need for convergence
    in that era produced the uber-chunky Cheltenham. <BR> <BR>So, this is an ongoing
    technical engagement with &#34;druk&#34;. <BR> <BR>Digitally, we have been through
    the rough early days, emerging into digital mastery -- with extreme high-res typography
    &#40;admittedly, planar lithography can never achieve the palpability of letterpress,
    or the density of toner, but its resolution is superior&#41;.  <BR> <BR>So, I
    would say that the present vogue for chunky type, if there is such a trend, is
    a reaction against the recent high-res phenomenon of typographers spec&#39;ing
    tiny, ultra-light/ultra-fine type on smooth coated stock, a communal indulgence
    to &#34;push it&#34; to a limit that was previously unattainable. '

    <BR> <BR>&#62;Cheltenham was a &#34;retro-fashion statement&#34;, not a &#34;production

    reflection, perhaps I overstated by saying that the need for convergence &#40;one
    typeface for many printing situations&#41; produced its design: rather, convergence
    made it hugely popular, because with its sturdiness it would hold up under abuse,
    and yet with its precisely drawn features, it had a neatness that worked in many

    it appeal to the &#34;Arts and Crafts&#34; set, but its appeal was more widespread

    Goudy Old Style, etc. <BR> <BR>Ultimately, I agree with you on cognitive dissonance

    1905, you can see that display-size Cheltenham has a mechanically drafted precision

  body: 'I&#39;m going to try to respond to what I think the original point was meant
    to get at. I think the terms &#34;chunky,&#34; &#34;clunky,&#34; and even Nick&#39;s
    &#34;sturdy&#34; are misleading. They imply a quality of weight and a stubbiness
    that, while often present in some of the examples cited, is not necessarily inherent
    in the kind of unexpected geometry that I think is the primary characteristic.  <BR>
    <BR>I think that what A. Scott was referring to is what I have called a &#34;digital
    vernacular&#34; -- a quality of simplified and often unexpected geometry being
    applied in otherwise traditional forms. From my perspective this trend traces
    back through faces like Downer&#39;s Vendetta &#40;1997&#41; and Majoor&#39;s
    Scala &#40;1991&#41; to van Blokland&#39;s Proforma &#40;1988&#41; and Carter&#39;s
    Charter &#40;1987&#41; and ultimately to Unger&#39;s Swift &#40;1985&#41;. Pre-digital
    influences include Dwiggins&#39;s experiments on the one hand and the Czech &#34;school&#34;
    &#40;Menhart, Preissig foremost, Tyfa also&#41; on the other. <BR> <BR>It strikes
    me that there are two threads of motivation in these precedents -- one technical
    and the other aesthetic. The early digital faces I cited were, as Nick pointed
    out, to a large extent confronting technical constraints, and their simplified
    geometry comes from efforts to create robustness in the face of coarse resolutions,
    as well as to conserve memory. The character that comes through is influenced
    strongly by the problems set before the designers. <BR> <BR>The other thread is
    an aesthetic one. The Czech designers were essentially operating within the general
    &#34;expressionist&#34; zeitgeist. The willfully coarse finish of Menhart and
    Preissig comes from a desire to infuse energy into traditional letterforms while
    at the same time stripping them of any excess typographic baggage. <BR> <BR>Dwiggins,
    in his own way, was also motivated primarily by aesthetic concerns. His experiments
    in what he called the &#34;M-formula&#34; were foremost an attempt to infuse a
    certain &#34;snap&#34; and &#34;action&#34; to the letterforms. His newsface efforts
    also professed to combat certain optical/technical constraints as well. But I
    think primarily he was exploring a type aesthetic that was influenced by his own
    cultural milieu -- Art Deco and Cubism, among others. This aesthetic is seen more
    overtly in his stencilled ornament and illustration. <BR> <BR>Nowadays, the technical
    constraints facing Unger and Carter are largely overcome &#40;at least in print&#41;,
    and yet Swift and Charter still seem fresh and vital. The continued exploration
    of this formal territory in contemporary designs seems primarily for aesthetic
    effect.  <BR> <BR>Speaking for myself, there is a fascination with taking seemingly
    inexpressive, reductive elements -- straight lines and simple curve segments --
    and carefully combining them to create an unexpected grace or an organic tension.
    The yin/yang of the geometric vs. the organic is an ages-old formal dichotomy
    that can be found interspersed throughout the history of visual culture. The trend
    that we see in some contemporary type designs is just another expression of that
    exploration. <BR> <BR>I use the term &#34;digital vernacular&#34; because this
    kind of expression seems to embody an inherently digital aesthetic: there is a
    sense of &#34;truth to the material&#34; that is appealing. I say <i>&#34;seems
    to&#34;</i> because strictly speaking, of course, this isn&#39;t true at all --
    there is nothing about beziers that lends them more to straight lines or simple
    curves; in fact, the wonderful inventiveness of bezier curves is exactly the opposite,
    that they can be so complex and supple.  <BR> <BR>Similarly, there is nothing
    inherent in the woodcut medium that demands the rough, coarse cuts of the Expressionist
    work of Kirchner as opposed to the fine detail of engravings by Bewick, for example.
    And yet the raw woodcuts seem to evince a greater &#34;truth to the material.&#34;
    [But now, I&#39;ve wandered far afield.] <BR> <BR>Anyway, those are some of my
    reflections on the matter. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

    same.  <BR> <BR>As to the popularity of Cheltenham, which Hector finds inexplicable,

    metal rather than the printed form as the basis for the digital design. These
    new faces were never metal, so they are designed through-and-through with the
    final product in mind by type designers who want to achieve the sturdier forms
    of earlier type. For a while, I didn&#39;t like these newer sturdier faces because

    characteristics, in its heft, and perhaps in its proportions &#40;by &#34;tall&#34;
    I presume you mean a small x-height&#41;, but the mechanical qualities of its
    drafting are at odds with the dominant feature of Arts &amp; Crafts/Revivalist
    type design of the early 20thC, which is its hand-made quality, which is essentially
    anti-mass production. <BR> <BR>Certainly, there were formal qualities in Arts
    &amp; Crafts era design in architecture and design &#40;such as simplicity and
    geometric pattern -- eg in Macintosh, Wright&#41;, which was proto -Deco, -Modern,
    and -Moderne, but in graphics, typography and type design the movement was resolutely
    old-world, and as I said, expressive of the hand in its execution. Again, Goudy&#39;s
    types, and Benton faces such as his Garamond and Cloister, and Cooper&#39;s Black
    -- these are the defining, most used faces of that era, and they bear no trace
    of the ruler, set square, or compass: Cheltenham is very different from these.
    And Century. <BR> <BR>But enough of Cheltenham. I&#39;d rather discuss the present
    day. We do tend to lapse into kicking the old chestnuts around, don&#39;t we?
    In the post where I mentioned Cheltenham, I gave equal space to phototype, but
    no-one wants to talk about that. ITC Garamond is persona non grata! <BR> <BR>Chris,
    you are right in your observation about &#34;anemic digitizing&#34;, many type
    designers &#40;including myself&#41; wrestled with this in the early days of digital
    type. But &#34;anemic phototype&#34; was also a problem -- as an art director
    in the &#39;70s and &#39;80s, I found that the funkiness of old metal type and
    hand-lettering &#40;which I saw in old books and magazines&#41; was something
    sorely missing in the slick smoothness of commercial typography. <BR> <BR>So really,
    this is an endless phenomenon, the battle of art against commercial slickness
    -- it is what propelled Morris into type design, among others. <BR> <BR>Hector,
    I agree with you that Cheltenham lacks subtlety in execution. This can be a virtue
    in a typeface: it will accomodate sloppy printing, and will not embarrass typographers
    who use it without much skill. There are many faces like this.  <BR> <BR>Personally
    &#40;with the precedent and advice of Oz&#41;, I have designed typefaces that
    could have been slicker and smoother, but some judicious awkwardness adds character.
    But no, I don&#39;t like Cheltenham, although I did use it for an ad once, and
    it worked well. '

    saw something that was clearly prime for mass-market popularity, and was got ATF

    the bandwagon, directing knockoffs, revivals, and stuff inspired by older models.
    The part of A&amp;C he saw value in was turning back to historical models for
    type. The auteur-like private press and careful craftsmanship part of A&amp;C,
    well, I don&#39;t know if that was such a big concern to him. Perhaps it was just
    irrelevant, insofar as ATF was solely a retail foundry and not really a printer/publisher
    &#40;its glorious specimen books notwithstanding&#41;. So they just made the type,
    and what folks did with it was up to them. But certainly supplying people who
    were part of the A&amp;C movement could have been only a tiny part of ATF&#39;s
    sales. <BR> <BR>BTW, when ATF knocked off Morris, they didn&#39;t just do a straight
    knockoff, but &#34;fixed&#34; some of the letters in ways that make me cringe

    preceding 20thC modernism, and harkening back to guild days, was retro. But many
    aspects of it were forward-looking. Progressive socialism was a feature of the
    movement. Morris was some kinda feminist, and he and Jane Morris pioneered sensible

    the answer is obvious, but it is not to a laser engine. One engine has to remove

  body: Nick -- <BR> <BR>A more apples-to-apples comparison for you. This is from
    the 1923 ATF catalog, 10 pt. Latin Antique No. 520 on high-finish, coated stock.
    <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/39413.gif" alt="Latin
    Antique No. 520 10 point"> <BR> <BR>I direct your attention toward the top serifs
    of S and G and the top right serif of T in particular. Not quite as sharp as Beaufort,
    perhaps, but sharper than one might expect. <BR> <BR>This demonstration is limited,
    of course, by the 600 dpi resolution of my scanner and the coarseness of screen
    display. <BR> <BR>&#40;Apologies for the slightly oversize width, but I wanted
    to show the whole thing at maximum resolution.&#41; <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Thank you Kent. <BR> <BR>I am without my catalogues. <BR> <BR><i>Consider
    this: at 2540 dpi resolution, the smallest discrete increment is .00039&#34;.
    The Linotype machining process &#40;as just one example&#41; was capable of tolerances
    as fine as .00025&#34;.</i> <BR> <BR>Few people will know just how fine .00025&#34;
    is. Trust me, it is really fine. Lanston specs are, .00010 which is even finer.
    Linotype and Lanston did not share &#34;unit standards&#34; which is &#34;possibly
    why&#34;, but another discussion, not to mention speculative on my part. <BR>
    <BR>In other words, digital 2540 dpi is like &#34;my dear dead grandmother&#39;s
    washboard&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Where as increments for hot metal &#34;machine setting&#34;
    punches <a href="http://lanstontype.com/Punch.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/Punch.html</a>
    <BR> were astounding. Attention should be paid to the quotation marks. <BR> <BR>The
    &#34;increments on the gauge&#34; were so fine you could &#34;not&#34; read them
    without the aid of the built in &#34;powerful microscope&#34;. <BR> <BR>This gauge,
    although not huge, could &#34;not be moved&#34; because it would alter the temperature
    of the materials the gauge was made of. The gauge and punches sat at &#34;same
    room temperature&#34; before the final testing. The National Research Council
    initially dismissed my claims of accuracy until they visited the plant. The height-to-paper
    matrix grinding machine was an optical marvel as well. I learned a great deal
    about optics when I was learning to cut punches. An interesting point, they had
    to pour 6 tons of molten glass to get 1 ounce of optical quality glass. Not only
    that, but the chemistry of the glass was made specifically for this gauge. The
    final trick was to &#34;find that ounce of glass&#34; within '

  body: '&#40;Excellent specimen, Kent&#41; <BR> <BR>Great thread, even if it did
    wander off topic. <BR> <BR>What I get from it is that when discussing a particular
    aesthetic  effect of type, it&#39;s very hard to meaningfully isolate the contribution
    of one aspect of the typography process &#40;in particular font technology&#41;
    from the whole. I suppose that should have been obvious. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m frustrated
    by the level of detail that it&#39;s possible to observe. &#40;A beef I had with
    the Octavo CD of the Manuale Tipografico.&#41; If not 2400 dpi on my little SnapScan,
    what resolution of desktop scanner would do the job? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>'

    <BR>Think nothing of it, I always try to be as distracting as &#34;I am&#34;.
    It&#39;s just the way I was brought up.
