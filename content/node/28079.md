  book and I'm using Trajan for the titling text. If you have time, I would appreciate
  some constructive criticism on what can be done to improve the look/readibility
  of it, I think it looks ok but something strikes me as being NQR, if anyone can
  help I would really appreciate I am a bit out of my depth at this macro tweaking
  level\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nNick"
