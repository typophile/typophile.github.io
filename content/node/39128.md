  been racking my brains and the closest I can get is an usual cut of Optima. I'm
  sure that it's probably something really simple and I shall have to hang my head
  in shame!\r\n\r\nWith thanks in advance and best wishes, Jonathan"

    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/strayhorn-mt/">Strayhorn Light</a>
    that I think share some features...

    wrong. I edited the post replacing  what I had written with \u201CNevermind\u201D.
    Should have marked as edited."

    actually the Optima sits nicer in any layout with the logo so far...\r\n\r\nBest,
