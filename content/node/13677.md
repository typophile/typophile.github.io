  they returned from Chicago, USA, where Bruno worked for [[Monotype Corporation]].
  Initially working on smaller projects, such as refining logotypes, we have been
  entrusted with providing typographic solutions for large, multi-national corporations.\r\n\r\nToday,
  we boast a skilled staff and a high-quality client list, both corporate clients
  and design agencies, many of whom have returned to employ our skills and expertise
  again and again; many of whom have become our friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur People\r\nBruno
  Maag, Managing Director\r\nAfter graduating from [[Basel School of Design]], [[Switzerland]],
  with a degree in Typographic Design and Visual Communications, he emigrated to England
  to work for Monotype in their type studio. After a year and a half in England, Bruno
  transferred to Monotype Chicago where he was responsible for their custom typeface
  department. During this time he re-cut all of the typefaces then in use by The New
  Yorker magazine for use on Macintosh. After returning to England in 1991 Bruno started
  Dalton Maag with Liz Dalton. Bruno is also the current Chairman of [[The Typographic
