  am doing a poster and placing some supposed Scientific Illustration in it. Could
  you give me some suggestion of what font could i use? Do you know of any free font
  available for this test?\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is a design question. Should
  small caps be used in this way? I find them a bit heavy\r\nhttp://yfrog.com/7esmallcapsj\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any info!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Sebastian,\r\nthis is not a font, but handwriting. This style is called
    Kurrentschrift, it was popular in Germany until the 1940s.\r\nYour sample reads
    \u2018Junger Fliegenschwamm\u2019 [young fly agaric].\r\n\r\nSee these older threads
    for more information:\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/67004\">German script
    on \"Das wei\xDFe Band\" movie poster</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/65337\">Beautiful
    handwritten cookbook</a>\r\n\r\nThere are not a lot digital Kurrent fonts. DS-Kurrent,
    the font mentioned in the first thread, will bring you only somewhat close. If
    you need something more commonly readable, try [[Viktor Solt-Bittner]]\u2019s

  body: "Hi Florian,\r\n\r\nGreat answer here. I found one freeware Kurrent style
    font. Wiegel Kurrent\r\n\r\nhttp://www.chip.de/downloads/Wiegel-Kurrent-Font_36248849.html\r\n\r\nnot
    as great as Viktor or Voluta as you posted but it is free and might help to visualize
    the idea in the poster. I am going to try how that looks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nS\r\n\r\n"

    writing an option?"
