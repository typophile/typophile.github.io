  body: "Hi staybeautiful! ;-)\r\n\r\nFunny that you are looking for this font at
    the moment. It was yesterday when I asked myself the same question. Think I have
    started a thread with this theme also.. \r\nDefinitely recently someone has made
    some changes in this logo so that it really looks good now!\r\nAnd I wondered
    who could it be..\r\nThe new ad pages of Lauren now are one of the best.\r\nI
    don\u2019t believe that Fenice - at least using it as it is as a standard font
    - brings you any nearer.\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to see if there is anyone
    joining in here with new information about the making of this logotype.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck\r\nStefan"
