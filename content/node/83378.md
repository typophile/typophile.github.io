  to get an answer to yet.  Lately I have been hand drawing fonts i have found and
  using them in my art to write my writing's. \r\nDoes anyone know the legality with
  drawing fonts? \r\nThanks for taking the time to read this "

    and creating a font that you can use on the computer?\r\n\r\nAnd what are the
    fonts you have found? Are these on your machine? Or printed specimens? \r\n\r\nAnd
    what are you doing with the resulting typefaces? If you're selling someone else's
    design without acknowledgement that's not good.\r\n\r\nAnd are you copying faithfully
    or interpreting/extrapolating from the source designs?"

  body: 'It also depends what sort typefaces. For example, copying a digital font
    of old woodtype which has itself been copied from an old Dover book is, to me,
    different from copying a very unique display face which was recently designed
    specifically as a digital font. '

  body: Hi:) thanks for all your responses.  I am drawing on paper with a fine ink
    pen and creating something new from them. They are old fonts i have found printed
    on things, old newspapers and packaging, mostly decorative ones. I am not copying
    faithfully, i am changing and adding lots to these.  As of now i have not sold
    any, but a few people have asked me recently if they could buy them so that is
    why i wanted to check first.

  body: "Hm, so people want to buy your drawings, or do you want to make them into
    computer fonts? \r\n\r\nLegally I think you're not in trouble either way as long
    as you're not fiddling with someone else's font program. Ethically I'd definitely
    want to be acknowledging the sources and adding a lot of interpretive touches."

  body: "No this has absolutely nothing to do with a computer, the drawings are completely
    done by hand and so much is added and taken away from the original lettering I
    have found. I have asked a lot of people but no one really knows the answer. \r\nI
    don't know a thing about creating a font from scratch, do people not take inspiration
    from other fonts when creating new ones? Thanks so much for your input, I really
    appreciate it:)"

    making fonts...sounds like you''re lettering rather than fontmaking. '

  body: A font is a program that renders a typeface (design) on a computer; lettering
    is when words are created individually by hand.

  body: Lettering can be handmade OR produced on a computer. The real difference is
    that a piece of lettering is produced as a one off solution to a specific problem,
    whereas a font is made to work as well as possible in a large number of unknown
    applications.
