  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I work at an agency that has been around for over 21 years.  The current logo was developed 12 years ago.  The logo fits with our semi slogan &ldquo;Juggling Experts&rdquo; as we explain to our clients how we help them juggle the 4 P&rsquo;s of marketing.  This serves as an excellent metaphor and selling tool for our sales leads.</p>
<p>We feel like the current logo does a decent job of conveying our whimsical/creative yet organized environment (e.g. our employees bring their dogs to work, and the dogs are free to roam the office, we&rsquo;re a little different from your typical agency).  However, we are currently reviewing our logo to determine if an update is needed, considering the cost (easily $10K) to convert all of our material (business cards, web site, letterheads, etc.) to a new logo.</p>
<p>We would like some more outside, honest opinions and reactions to our logo.</p>
<p>Does it make you want to know more about our company?
If you didn&rsquo;t know what we do, what industry would you think we were in?
What does it remind you of initially? 
Does it seem up to date?<br>
Does it convey what we do?
Does it inspire intrigue or confusion?
Is it too simple, silly, serious, corporate, common, or complicated?<br>
Would it look better with a simple change in font or color scheme?</p>
<p>We would love your thoughts, suggestions, and criticisms.  Should we keep it the same and save some serious cash?  <img src="/images/old-images/dca_logo_5911.jpg" alt=""></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just as a quick gut-reaction, I&rsquo;d say the name is the bigger issue. I read DCA/DCPR as the focus which means absolutely nothing to me nor is it very memorable.</p>
<p>I like the ball. Maybe emphasize that while downplaying the big acronym:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/dc_5725.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The sample is just to show scale (ie, type was just slapped on there).</p>
<p>That said, I have no idea how much name recognition/equity you might already have in that acronym.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree that the acronym is a bit long, but I bet the clients, in and around his locale, have taken care of that. I.e. they probably have shortened it to DCA when they talk of their agency. When I started at a type house in 1981 the names we called customers did not even resemble their real identity. WE know, but how forthcoming is DA Design. It certainly is not obvious to the casual onlooker who DA is on first blush.</p>
<p>The bottom line for me is the letterforms. They are fun, but maybe a bit too fun. About 3 hours on the board, I am old fashioned, and you could lend some credibility to the forms and keep the playfulness but at the same time add some integrity to them. The colors&hellip; well the beach ball kind of dictates that unless you went with more mature colors&hellip; but does that defeat the purpose of the youth ethos?</p>
<p>I am so tired of Agencies who use letterspaced, boring, tried and trued, over-used fonts for their ID. Have some fun if it is called for. That is my calligraphic slant coming out! But make it above reproach!
