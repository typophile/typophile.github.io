body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nWondering if someone can help point me in a useful direction
  in identifying a typeface similar to the one used in this film title card. I'm aware
  that it's most likely a hand-job (tsk) but I'm looking to recreate a title like
  this and a starting point with a similar ornateness to build upon would be useful.
  \r\n\r\nNote: Just watched the opening credits to the original film and all the
  credits are done in the same fashion. If that helps I don't know...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ximQyzWH_H8\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nAdam"
