body: "Hey all, \r\nThis is my first post. I have been a silent viewer for a while
  now. \r\nI've written [[http://alecjacobson.com/programs/font/java|an applet]] that
  allows the user to compare any two fonts on her machine. The applet let's the user
  fine tune sizes and location allowing for a close-up and detailed font comparison.
  It's a java applet that runs in the browser (as long as you have java enabled):\r\nhttp://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=89\r\n\r\n<a

  me know what you think and if you have any suggestions for improvements!\r\nThanks"

  body: "Really cool idea and great execution.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I'm questioning
    is the sole ability to compare fonts on one's own machine. Should there be a way
    to compare fonts that one doesn't have/own the rights to? Though I'm not sure
    how that would happen without necessitating a rather hefty online database. \r\n\r\nAnyway,
    like I said, great job so far. And I appreciate the ability to freely move around
    the two specimens. You may also think about incorporating some form of guide system,
    so the user can align the two fonts more easily. \r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Yeah. I totally wish that I could include fonts the user doesn't have/own
    the rights to. \r\nI will look into the possibility of hosting all of my existing
    fonts (I have quite a few) and then having an option to load (my) external fonts.
    \r\n\r\nGuide system is a great idea. I will certainly throw some graph paper
    in the background, at least. Do you think \"snapping\" like Adobe products would
    be worthwhile as an option? Or just an annoyance?"

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nI added three new features: if you type <em>grid</em> that
    will toggle a graph paper background, <em>switch</em> will switch the two fonts
    (so you drag the other one, just in case that feels better) and <em>random</em>
    just for fun, will select to fonts at random. Let me know if these features are
    dumb/too hard to use etc. Thanks."

  body: "If possible I think there should be a type field to change the text. Also
    scaling should be made more intuitive through a pull down menu as opposed to pushing
    the left or right arrows. Also, the switch/grid functions should probably be check
    boxes rather than typed commands. Also, when I type switch, I still can only move
    the red one.\r\n\r\nI like the grid system you have there\u2014it makes it really
    easy to line them up\r\n\r\nGood work so far :)\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "That looks cool enough to be implemented into existing Font Managers, or
    even in a program like InDesign! When I have to combine any two fonts into one
    document, I always have a go at getting their optical sizes right -- not just
    the \"point size\".\r\n\r\nBut I'm finding my old IE keeps the focus on one of
    the drop down lists, so I can't use the arrows without selecting another font
    at the same time ?:(\r\n(Don't worry -- I'll try tomorrow on an up-to-date IE.)"

  body: "Many thanks again for the suggestions and compliments. I have a much changed
    (an hopefully much improved) version up now, still at [[http://alecjacobson.com/programs/font/java/]].
    The old version is still available for comparison's sake, now at  [[http://alecjacobson.com/programs/font/java/old]].
    I implemented some sliders for the sizes, handles for dragging both fonts,  a
    text field (with the option of inputting the old way because I was used to that
    and why not), and some buttons.\r\n\r\nStill haven't found a way to easily host
    fonts users might not have locally. \r\n\r\nAnyway, enjoy and keep the suggestions
    and comments coming."

  body: "Hey, that's already much better! The size bars are an improvement, as even
    the very latest IE keeps keyboard focus on either the dropdownlists or the text
    input box.\r\n\r\nBut the size bars are a bit small ... It must be the long font
    names in my system:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/versus_4079.PNG]\r\n\r\nAnd
    apparently, the Windows version doesn't see OpenType fonts, just TTFs, but I'm
    fully prepared to blaim the Java implementation for that (I'm using Sun's own,
    also the latest)."

    to PC right now, so it helps a lot to see how this is showing up on other browsers.\r\n\r\nI
    have included info boxes (which can be toggled to show pt size or %) and I put
    the sliders on their own row (does this look better on IE?). Hopefully things
    aren't getting too crowded.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's up with the OpenType fonts

  body: "This might be a minor thing, but I would suggest some way of changing the
    default colors.  It doesn't bother me personally, but I'm sure there may be someone
    out there that might be jarred by it.  Maybe a small dropdown next to each list
    where they can change the colors?\r\n\r\nOn a related note, for the same reason
    as above, I suggest that the font colors should not be within the fontlists.  The
    blue especially might make it hard for some people to read the titles (as the
    font names are coming in black).\r\n\r\nOther than that, great job!"

    Also, I''m guessing you are running this on a Windows machine (I only have access
