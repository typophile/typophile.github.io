  body: There are at least two different typefaces at work here, probably both hand-painted,
    especially the top one with its odd proportions. The bottom one bears some resemblance
    to Futura Display or my own Turista Gorda NF, but only some...

  body: "The SOESTERBERG lettering in the lower sample looks like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/%28Futura+Steile%29/fonts/\">Futura
    Stiele</a>. Some of the other lettering looks like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/block-be/\">Berthold
    Block</a>. Of course, anything that old could always be hand-lettered (or use
    decals made from hand-lettered originals).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
