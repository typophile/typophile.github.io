body: "This is a simple monogram I've been playing with, based on my initials (SA).
  I've only just realized how beautifully these two letters combine with Optima, but
  now I can't make up my mind. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monogram_6739.jpg]\r\n\r\nAs
  you can see, progressing through the weights with this shape squeezes the small
  bridge of the <strong>a</strong> until it disappears. I can't decide if I like that
  elegant but fragile detail or if I prefer the stronger but somewhat chunky look
  of the demi-bold. The medium weight is mostly for comparison.\r\n\r\nWhich do you
  prefer?"

  body: "Take it from a professional graphic designer - the \"S\" does not read well
    enough to warrant such as extreme combination. The legibility of the \"S\" is
    lost, and it also takes on a secondary position because it is lower, thus making
    the viewer think your initials are AS, if they can even read it at all. It really
    just looks like an \"a\" with a strange tail.\r\n\r\nIf anything, perhaps you
    could try creating a separation between the characters by clarifying the boundaries
    of each character, possibly by stroking the outside of the \"S\" with a white
    outline. "

  body: "I agree with jimsbee, I don't read the S at all, but knowing what I'm looking
    for I see and read AS no SA. Color might help but I think you need to go back
    to the drawing board and see what else you can come up with. Try sketching first
    then go to the computer. \r\n"

  body: "I'd suggest you try to change the demi-bold to start with your letter S and
    then add the A. SO the top part of the S would change the A not he other way around.
    Now the S is adapted to A and I want the A to adapt to S. This will make the S
    stand out, because now it looks more like a diacritic than a letter.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I'd also try doing that with medium weight not the demi bold. Did you also try
    mixing the weights to emphasize name/surname?"

  body: "the first one is an improvement to what was presented before. It's a pitty
    we can't see the small sized one too, because that one was producing distracting
    diacritic in my eyes. I did make it smaller myself and I guess it works much better...\r\n\r\nthe
    second one is a completely new approach. I like it, but I find the first approach
    much more innovative."

  body: Here's a vote for your second version. I like that one. A bit abstract but
    certainly iconic. The 's' and 'a' are also given equal weight which is its strength,
    IMHO.

  body: "Rather than joining the two letters stroke-wise an abstract approach may
    be easier to make succeed. These are suggestions, ideas only, a few starting points
    you can expand or elaborate upon, or push in other design directions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sa3_6638.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sa1_4305.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sa2_3828.gif]\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I like the first one here with the grey \"a\" and white \"s\", but that's just
    my personal preference. Of the two drop-shadow versions the middle is more successful
    than the last one.\r\n\r\nfont is Zapf Humanist 601: ultra weight for \"a\", and
    demibold weight for \"s\". Rendering the \"s\" at a smaller size makes it much
    easier to fit into the \"a\". The \"s\" can be whatever color you fancy, since
    it's a personal logo.\r\n\r\n\r\nj a m e s\r\n\r\n"
