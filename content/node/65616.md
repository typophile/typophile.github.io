    Demiserif Light]]. It's not an exact match but a lot of the feeling is the same.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks for your kind replies. Mike & Andreas. Looks like it was inspired
    by Rotis Semi serif.\r\n@Andreas, \r\nThe unknown serif is quite different from
    Imperial. I'd like to think it's a not-so-good hybrid of Imperial and Ela Demi
    Serif."
