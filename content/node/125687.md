body: "How can I add a self-created dingbat into the text body, without saving it
  as an image?\r\nOn the image, the second and third dingbats are found on illustrator
  under wingdings; however, I drew the first one (with 3 curved lines) with pen tool
  in illustrator.\r\nWhen I start typing, I have to keep a space in order to put my
  own dingbat (as a shape) in the paragraph. Is there anyway that I could transform
  it into the text?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    TypeTool, Fontographer etc.\r\nYou then would have a font you could call \" my
    dingbats\" and mix into text."
