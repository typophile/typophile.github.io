body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nI really like the effect of over printed colors. How do you
  accomplish this in Inkscape (an open source vector illustration program). Is there
  a plugin that does this? There is a utility- Art Directors Toolkit- I can use to
  learn the RBG numbers but after that I know don't what to do. Unfortunately, Adobe
  products are not a viable option right now :-(\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blend_6633.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/knoll_4866.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/title_4115.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/magnetic4~~_nessemund_101b_4110.jpg]

  for helping"

  body: "Thank you Tiff. That's something I really never though of. It's not easily
    acomplished tho.\r\n\r\n- Select two objects.\r\n\r\n- Path>Intersection\r\n\r\n-
    select and copy the intersection\r\n\r\n- undo until the two objects are in their
    original states\r\n\r\n- paste in place the intersection\r\n\r\n- change the original
    color of intersection to the desired blend color\r\n\r\n- Voil\xE0\r\n\r\nIn Illustrator
    there must be an easier way right and certainly with more control. :-( \r\n\r\nMaking
    incremental changes requires you do all the steps again. I haven't tried more
    than two colors but it does not look possible here.\r\n\r\nBut thanks Tiff...
    if you ever need a baby daddy just holla :-)\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "Mike,\r\n\r\nJust today I noticed an option that appears to provide the effect
    you were after.  It's not in the \"stable release\" yet, but more recent development
    builds let you specify a \"Blend Mode\".  It looks like this is accomplished on
    a per-object basis using the Fill and Stroke dialog.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\nAric"

    builds already built:\r\n\r\nhttp://inkscape.modevia.com/macosx-snap/?M=D\r\n\r\nIf
    you're concerned about instability, you should be able to install a development
    build without uninstalling the most recent stable version.  Of course, you can
    still wait for the next release, but I think the improved font support and the
    new sculpting tool are worth the risk of instability (I haven't personally noticed
    any instability yet).\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll shut up now :)"
