    both great in their own ways. You're in Pasadena?\r\nTry to make it to Typo-SF

  body: "I'm a malcontent - I see flaws in anything*. And I'm rarely\r\nshy about
    revealing them. However each instance of TypeCon\r\nor ATypI is a bit different,
    with different pros and cons, so\r\nI'd need a particular year. Unless you're
    talking about the\r\noverall aspects, which however would be somewhat nebulous.\r\n\r\n*
    Actually though I have trouble with the Yin-Yang symbol.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: The taiji (yin-yang) symbol main flaw is that it always needs a background
    (or a frame).

  body: "I think one of the major \"cons\" of the ATypI conference is its cost. That
    coupled with its being held in the beginning of the Fall Semester makes it impossible
    for many North Americans who do some teaching to attend.\r\n\r\nIn the past TypeCon
    has suffered from a hobbiest v professional split personality. This last one in
    New Orleans finally threw that off and was an important professional event, that
    I enjoyed."
