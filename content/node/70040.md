  Kitchen magazine and also their weekend newsletter - I am pretty sure it is part
  of the family used for the heading too. I cannot find anything but it seems to straddle
  serif and slabs, reminds me a bit of Archer and Soho. I'm beginning to think it
  is a special cut. I would appreciate any help at all.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance."
