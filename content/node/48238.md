  illustrator, but I need to find the PMS number to send to the printer.\r\n\r\nAlright,
  so first of all PMS just means pantone, correct?  Whats the difference between PMS
  color and Swatch #?\r\n\r\nWhats the easiest way to match the colors I already have?
  \ Photoshop?\r\n\r\nThanks!!!!!"

  body: "PMS is short for Pantone Matching System, but is often used interchangeably
    with \"Pantone\" to refer to colors in their library.  The PMS number is the swatch
    number that corresponds to the color from the Pantone library. Unless you have
    a pantone book to flip through (which I am guessing you probably dont) the only
    \"automatic\" way to do it is to use the color picker in Photoshop.  Enter the
    CMYK values into the picker, and click on \"libraries\".  That will give you what
    Photoshop estimates is the closest match.  However, this can sometimes not be
    very accurate.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, if you know you are going to need Pantone
    colors, I recommend picking your colors   from the Pantone swatch library in Illustrator
    to begin with. It is much easier to convert to CMYK from  Pantone than the other
    way around.  Beware however that different programs \"estimate\" CMYK values for
    Pantone colors differently (especially if you are using Quark).  So make sure
    that you proof the colors with either a match print or a Pantone book. "

  body: "get a Pantone Swatch book....  if you are printing SPOT best to know your
    colours. The printer you are dealing with should have one you could eye or go
    to <a href=\"http://www.pantone.com/pages/products/product.aspx?pid=293&ca=1&s=1\">here</a>
    to learn more, I have sent you to the swatch book with spot and cmyk comparison
    good to match to, depending on your printing method of course there are 2 Euro
    or SWOP. Talk to your printer first. Also if you are creating artwork, I suggest
    you use Illustrator for the file, to have control over the colours or so the printer
    can fix any issues you may encounter. With Photoshop, it is going to be raster
    depending on how your graphic is created, you would then need to save it as duo,
    tri or more depending on how many colours and this can be more hassle than it
    is worth. If however it is a image and full colour (cmyk), then you do not need
    to worry about spot colours or Pantone, you ned to make sure your resolution and
    colour settings are correct as per the printers specifications.\r\n"
