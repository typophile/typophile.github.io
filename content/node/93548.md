body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to install robofab into fontlab 5.1.\r\nI am following
  this method : https://vimeo.com/36877594\r\nbut when I am trying to install the
  Font Tools package I get this message in the terminal in the middle of the install
  :\r\n\r\nunable to execute llvm-gcc-4.2: No such file or directory\r\n\r\nAnd when
  I am processing this command \r\nfrom robofab.world import CurrentFont\r\nin the
  macro window in Fontlab, instead of having a clear output window, I get this message
  :\r\n\"can't import dialogs_fontlab_legacy2\"\r\n\r\nI read that I had to made a
  clear install of xcode, but nothing changed. I am stucked here as I am not an expert
  in the terminal.\r\nIf it can be of any help I join the terminal window of the install.\r\n\r\nthanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/termi_5076.jpg]"

    I can tell.

    body: LLVM is the open-source compiler sponsored by Apple and heavily used in
      Apple's products. I believe XCode comes with a copy of it.

  body: '4.2 seems to be their latest GCC-based release, so may have to be installed
    separately. Good thing: Once that''s done, OP has a better chance of getting FontTools
    to work. Not perfect, but better.'
