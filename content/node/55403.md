body: I am confused about determining the width of the non-breaking space character.
  There seem to be two conventions in the fonts I looked at; using the same width
  as the space glyph and the other using half the width of the space glyph. What is
  the logic behind these two conventions?

    be -- as the name suggests -- the breaking behaviour.\r\n\r\nSince line-breaking
    is not controlled by the font, the font designer should treat them identically."

  body: While the non-breaking space is intended to keep things like french quotes
    (which often use a space before the line of text) from becoming orphaned, its
    width can be made smaller. I posted a similar question a while back, but found
    out that the NB space is actually becoming archaic. InDesign will completely ignore
    this glyph and sets space widths within the text menu of the application. I think
    the NB space will still work in freehand.
