  body: "Hi, thanks for taking a look. Times 18 Bold isn't as squat and wide. Also
    if you look at the thin parts of the curves on 'm' and 'h' you will see they are
    thinner on this font. So definitely no strokes added.\r\nAdditionally the obvious
    different slants of the 'h's' and 'm' and 't' top serifs.. \r\nI wouldn't of thought
    someone would've gone to that much effort in Illustrator just for this logo..
    gotta be an actual typeface, but not 100%. The h and y obviously blended together."
