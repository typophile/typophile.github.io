  tried to find info on it but I am coming up with nothing. There isn't even metadata

  help would be much appreciated."

  body: "Ha ha. I have a terrible singing voice.\r\n\r\nYes strange name. I have used
    it to nice effect though. There is also a shadow version and outline version.
    These versions are corrupted, so I would like to see if there are any other versions
    of it.\r\n\r\nJust nothing coming up. Since it's not obviously widely available,
    it's somewhat unique.\r\n\r\nActually what do think would be a good sans to go
    with it? "

  body: "That one is a typeface called Information or Information Extra Bold Wide.\r\nIn
    a quick search didn't find any digitized version with that name.\r\n\r\nAgree
    with formlos and looks also the one used for Petrol in Stephen's link.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a quote from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopaedia-Typefaces-Fifth-Jaspert/dp/1841881392/ref=sr_1_1/002-4804187-2657618?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1178289644&sr=1-1\">Jaspert's
    Encyclopaedia</a>:\r\n\"Information Extra Bold Wide was designed by F.K. Sallway
    in 1958 for Klingspor and taken over by Stempel, and in Germany called Breite
    Fette Information. Some of the Monuments types now also appear under this name.\"\r\n\r\nYou
    have samples in Jaspert's (incomplete) and in Phil's Homage to the Alphabet."

  body: Yes looks very close to 'Not a Number' etc except for one thing. There is
    some distress around the edges of certain letters.
