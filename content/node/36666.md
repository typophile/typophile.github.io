  of a pair of opposite words , then think of their visuals, but they should have
  a common theme. So i took the theme vegetables, and the words hot and cool.. and
  in case u still dont get this image.. its a chilli and a cucumber slice.\r\n\r\nNow
  i need some help.. i need to integrate a word into it, some what like a title on
  it..\r\nttaching some stupid exploration i did.. please help me on it.. and all
  criticism and suggestions are welcome!!\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "\u2026or the critique forum. I think your images combined with type would
    improve by increasing the scale of the type, however for that style of illustration,
    I would look at a more robust and simple typeface. Rather than trying to combine
    the type as closely as you have, try printing the word at various scales, trim
    them close and position against a printout of the image, when you have something
    that you feel works, step back and consider the composition and relative scales
    there may be an opportunity to combine the type with the vegetables in the place
    of a character, but I think going through the process will give you food for thought.
    I would also try this with the water removed \u2013 I feel that it has an autotraced
    feel that doesn\u2019t chime well with the stippling used for tone in the rest
    of the image.\r\n\r\nTim"
