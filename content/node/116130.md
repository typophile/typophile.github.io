    the E is too wide, and the weight falls between Houschka Rounded Bold and Houschka

  body: ">Or it could just be Arial Rounded Bold\r\nThe _O_ is not close enough to
    the almost perfect circle of BENETTON and the N is too narrow. Same problems with
    Helvetica rounded.\r\nAs for the dotted outline, this remains unmatched.\r\nDon"

    Bold in Illustrator based on this tutorial http://www.creativebeacon.com/dotted-stroke-in-illustrator/\r\nI
    was able to make a somewhat matching image this way, but the vector base font
    was unchanged. Seems to be a learning curve here.\r\nDon"

  body: "Here is a progress report on my attempt to use the dotted stroke technique
    in Illustrator. Used a couple of letters from Proxima Nova and set them at 72
    points. Used Transform/scale 800%. Opened Window/Stroke. Set width at 10 pixels.
    Checked dotted line box & set stroke length and gap both at 10 pixels. Got rid
    of the fill so had an image that looked like an outline consisting of small boxes.
    Zoomed so that the two letters filled a fair part of the screen. Did a screen
    grab. Pasted into a paint program -- I used an old one, Paint Shop Pro 7, which
    works as well as Photoshop for these jobs and is a lot less complicated. Cropped
    the image. Reduced colors to 2. Saved as tif. Opened image in an old version of
    Scanfont. Placed it into a font. Saved the font. Opened in Fontlab. Edited the
    little boxes and reduced scale -- in this case it was from about 6000 pixels to
    700 for an O. Did not bother to do the other letters but the technique would produce
    a font with the effect of dotted BENETTON. Time consuming! But works and a skill
    worth learning.  On balance, I doubt I would bother to produce more than a few
    letters for a logo using this technique.\r\np.s. A perfectionist might replace
    the little boxes -- which are awkward to do right on curved strokes -- with little
    circles.\r\nDon"
