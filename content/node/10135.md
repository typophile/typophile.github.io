  body: I don&#39;t know a term for it but it shows the influence of serigraphy and
    Japanese printmaking. It uses areas of solid color/shading to produce a 3D effect.
    The pastel colors of the background compared to the darker and more saturated
    foreground is a standard method of creating perspective. I think I&#39;ve seen
    that same mountain in a book of Adobe Illustrator tips &#40;not sure I can find
    it though&#41;.

  body: I&#39;m not sure what the particular style in your example is called, but
    I believe it is a typical example of guache painting, quite popular in commercial
    illustration in the early to mid 20th century. It is a kind of opaque watercolor
    which dries fairly quickly. This is probably why you usually see lots of flat
    color.

  body: Actually these fruit labels were probably lithographs. But may have been based
    on original gouache illustrations. <BR> <BR>See <a href="http://www.scripophily.net/clicherforol.html"

    the style.

  body: I would describe that as &#34;posterization&#34;. <BR> <BR>A term coined to
    describe the result of reproducing a con-tone image as set of spot colours. <BR>
    <BR>As Tom mentioned, it certainly was a common technique for screen printers,
    particularly in the days of paper stencils before photo-emulsion and consistant
    fine grade polyester mesh. <BR> <BR>Google offers lots of hits.

    <BR>Dutch designer Gielijn Escher &#40;no relation to M.C., as far as I know&#41;
    has a very extensive collection and is the author of a book about this -- it was
    privately published in 1976 in the Netherlands by Rosbeek Printers as a &#39;goodwill
    publication&#39; and probably unavalaible &#40;I may have it somewhere in storage&#41;.
