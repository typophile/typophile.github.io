  document, perhaps as much as 200 \r\nyears old. I wouldn't think there exists a
  font today\r\nto match, but is there any similar font that I might \r\nuse for the
  restaurant's website?\r\n\r\nI note the serifs on the lowercase l, v, a, and d,\r\nand
  the top serif on the uppercase C.\r\n\r\nhttp://clevelanderbar.googlepages.com/Clevelander1.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nredstart\r\n\r\n"
