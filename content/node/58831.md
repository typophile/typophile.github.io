body: "I'm currently designing a logo for a federally funded school program. One of
  my concepts  I sketched out used a type combination of a capital first letter with
  lower case remaining letters, like normal, but the remaining letters had an x-height
  that was equal to the height of the capital ascenders. example (T)(ypofile) the
  \"ypofile\" are the same height as the \"T\"\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on a font face
  to use? I'm not making a killing on this logo, and would prefer to not hand render
  the whole thing.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    a very, emphasize very rough sketch idea of the type face that I'm looking for.
    See the mixture of upper and lower case. I want the weight to match, I just didn't
    fully render it. "
