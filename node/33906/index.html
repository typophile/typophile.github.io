  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So, we've gotten our upgrade to CS3 and there are many improvements.

However, one thing I was looking forward to in the new ID find/change doesn't seem to behave as the manual advertises.

I am using the great new grep tool to find situational changes - in this case, a hyphen between numerals, so that I can change the telephone numbers' style to period-separation. So far, so good.

If I then make the change to period, the found numerals surrounding the hyphen are changed too. Not so good. Manual says to insert the found text variables there, which is basically a stop-change order; I try that, and the actual "found text" string, automatically inserted by the program, is inserted into the text ($01, $02, etc). Not so good either.

If anyone here can guide me as to how to correctly use this tool, I would be much obliged. An illustration is included so that you can see my mistake.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Joshua, I understand your pain. Regular expressions (GREP) are a very powerful mechanism, but at the same time they're also hard to master.

The case you're trying to match is actually one of the sample queries InDesign provides. I tried it out and it worked like a charm :)

		<div class="commentbody">BTW, alternatively to InDesign's provided expression on the "Find what:" field, you can use this one: <code>(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})</code>

I think this one is more intuitive* and does exactly(?) what you want. Translating it to English it means:
— Find a group of 3 digits;
— followed by a hyphen;
— followed by another group of 3 digits;
— followed by a hyphen;
— followed by group of 4 digits.

Then the expression in the field "Change to" means:
— What was found in group 1;
— follow it by a period;
— follow it by what was found in group 2;
— follow it by a period;
— follow it by what was found in group 3.

Simple, eh? ;^)

* The expression that comes with InDesign will match more cases, though; it will find and replace occurrences that have a hyphen, a period, a space, or nothing, between the groups of digits.</div>

The plus sign (+) means "Find one or more of the previous". So in this case it's matching one or more digits.

Didn't know about that problem. If the people on the InDesign team know about it, you can be assured that they're working on fixing it. I don't know when the update will be released (and even if I did I wouldn't be allowed to say; sorry).</div>

Do you know if this was simply a move to protect the sales of a plugin, or is that functionality simply relocated? I'm always surprised when a particularly helpful part of a program is removed in an "upgrade."

I actually never had the need to use this feature. Comparing the two I see that the CS3 version does not have the option "Create New Document", which is what you're asking about, I believe. I don't know why that change was made.

Was the ability to have your InDesign document in an imposed form an important feature for you? I assume you'd use such files just for printing, and that all the changes/corrections would be made in the original version, no? If so, then the lost of functionality is not that big, IMO.</div>

This was a tremendously useful feature for me, and now our production staff may decide that I should stick with CS2 and not upgrade until a plugin that handles this is available (although I think there may be a version of inbooklet for CS3 already).

But this is not the place for these discussions.
