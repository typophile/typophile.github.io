  body: OK. I know this one. <BR>But my book will have a different intention. It will
    be released in the &#34;index&#34;-series &#40;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1581801467"
    target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1581801467</a> &#41;
    <BR>and as such it will be that little helper for choosing fonts for a specific
    purpose. <BR> <BR>So are there any fonts out there that are not in IndieFonts
    &#40;yet&#41;? <BR> <BR>Ralf <BR> <BR>

    whether you&#39;re really the person to be compiling such a guide. <BR> <BR>There
    are lots of independent foundries that are not in the IndieFonts book that do
    good work, and even some that are. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typography.com"

  body: Hi Sylvia, <BR>of course I know what fonts and foundries are out there. I
    just started this thread to ask if there is anything brand new or upcoming I may
    have missed. <BR>I am a little bit astonished that I get only little response
    to my question in this board of hundrets of typedesigners from all over the world.
    The major foundries seem to understand the marketing effect of such books much
    better and already supported me in this project. <BR> <BR>Ralf <BR> <BR> <BR><a
