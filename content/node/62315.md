  everyone who helps with my question!  Thanks!\r\n\r\nI was wondering what font is
  used for the website WireNine.com ??\r\n\r\nThey have their text change upon refresh
  but, if you look underneath the banner on their main page, it will either say:\r\n\r\nStuck
  with another web host? WireNine can help!\r\n\r\nor..\r\n\r\nThe price you see is
  the price you get. NO HIDDEN FEES.\r\n\r\nor... \r\n\r\nBecome a Web Host today.
  Host UNLIMITED Domains!\r\n\r\nor it will say something else as well.  I was just
  curious as to what font they are using there?\r\n\r\nMy other question too was,
  what font they are using for the heading, cPanel Business Hosting ???\r\n\r\nThanks
  to all who help!\r\n\r\n  -Ryan"

    others may see Verdana, Helvetica, Arial or else. So if you post a picture of
    what YOU see, we can help more. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Was late, Jeff said it all \u2026"

  body: "@ Ryan:\r\n\r\nThat is an HTML call and the font in this case is dependent
    on which fonts you have installed on your machine. (eg. If you don't have the
    first option \"Trebuchet MS\" it will try the next on down the chain until it
    finds one that works)\r\n\r\nTHE HEADLINE - \"Stuck with another web host? WireNine
    can help!\"\r\n\r\nuses the following font call.\r\n\"Trebuchet MS\",\"Lucida
    Grande\",Helvetica,Verdana,sans-serif\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nTHE HEADLINE
    - \"cPanel Business Hosting\"\r\n\r\nuses the following font call.\r\n\"Century
    Gothic\",Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\r\n\r\nI'd recommend downloading a Firefox
    plug-in called 'Firebug'... it's great for analyzing HTML and CSS live on a site.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Made an update and slipped a spot. :)"

    records with a name, city and state.\r\n\r\nHas Typophile ever considered changing
    there policy on making all of that information available to the public?"

    not that hard to look anyone up on the web, anyone can do that, same thing with
    court records.\r\n\r\nI simply wanted to know what a font was, not have my message
    deemed as spam.\r\n\r\nMy last question for those that don't think my message
    is spamming, would anybody that views my website be able to see Trebuchet MS even
    if they did not have that font installed on their system?  I'm not sure if that
    is a standard font or not and I'm re-designing my site and would like to use a
    font that everyone can see regardless if they have it installed or not on their
    system.  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nYour's Truely\r\n\r\n   ~ Mr. Spammer.."

    the usual way, meaning without embedding the font in some way. But Trebuchet should
    be installed on almost all computers, at least running Mac OS or Windows. See
    *<a href=\"http://www.codestyle.org/css/font-family/sampler-CombinedResultsFull.shtml\">here</a>*."

    href=\"http://www.typetester.org/\">Typetester</a> has 'Trebuchet MS' listed on
    their 'safe list' but that doesn't mean someone can't remove it from their system.
    When working with type on the web there are no 'for sures'.\r\n\r\nNote: If you
    have have Microsoft Office installed you have Trebuchet MS."
