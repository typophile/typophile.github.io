  a Safari/Firefox canvas web app. I've just now got open Euler spiral splines working
  fairly well. You can play with it <a href=\"http://fontly.com/sandbox/spiro.html\">here</a>.
  Just start clicking within the canvas window.\r\n\r\nIt <em>won't</em> work in Internet
  Explorer. Use Firefox. Also, performance in Safari is weak. Use Firefox. You might
  find that closing your web browser and starting fresh helps a lot with performance.\r\n\r\nThere's
  plenty more to do, including closed curves, corner points, UI niceties, and so on,
  but this should give people here an idea where it's going. I will of course post
  again once it's a usable curve editor."

    Is a particular MacOSX or Firefox version required, or must particular options
    be activated?

    clicking in that empty window, and you should get points. The \"message\" shows
    errors when you push the curves too far for the program. \r\n\r\nHorton\r\nFounder,

    fantastic, but that will improve over time as (a) machines get faster, (b) the
    JavaScript / canvas implementations in Firefox get better (or someone ports this
    to Silverlight), and (c) I tweak the algorithms to do these calculations in even
    fewer floating point steps.\r\n\r\nIf people find it doesn't work even with a

    you abandonned the 'dial' idea you initially mentioned?

    Just the way all the\r\ncurve segments shift to ensure smoothness is by\r\nitself
    a great clue as to the merit of this method.\r\nOf course the big question becomes:
    how would you\r\nindicate that a previous segment shouldn't change?\r\nDoes that
    have to do with corner points? BTW, can\r\nyou have a corner point with or without
    a tangent?\r\n\r\nNow that Windows users can fool with this I think\r\nyou'll
    see a large ramp-up of interest. BTW, on my\r\n1.66GHz Intel Duo the performance
    is close enough\r\nto real-time, human-interface-wise.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the same token though, it's possible to think that the affinity for smoothness
    skews design in the same way that beziers do, if in a different dimension. On
    the other hand, the naturalness can be seen as making up for it, plus any time
    saved by using spirals could be used to contemplate one's design decisions/ideology.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "William: yes, I did abandon the explicit tangent setting in the interests
    of keeping the UI simple. I found that I didn't need it in my own work. If there
    is sufficient demand, I will implement it. Also keep in mind that there are other
    ways (in the full Spiro, but not <em>yet</em> in the web toy) to control the curvature
    in fontly ways, especially the one-way constraints.\r\n\r\nhrant: glad you like
    it, and that the performance is close to acceptable.\r\n\r\n<em>how would you\r\nindicate
    that a previous segment shouldn\u2019t change?\r\nDoes that have to do with corner
    points? BTW, can\r\nyou have a corner point with or without a tangent?</em>\r\n\r\nIn
    the full Spiro, there are corner points and one-way constraints. The one-way constraints
    are there for indicating straight-to-curve transitions. I don't have explicit
    tangents at corner points, but that would actually fit more neatly into the curve
    framework than wrangling tangents at smooth points. If I need a tangent, I usually
    just place a point near the end of the curve. Among other things, that technique
    lends itself more readily to interpolation between masters than does tangent setting.\r\n\r\nThe
    full Spiro also has both G2 and G4 smoothness constraints. Since those are mathematical
    descriptions of continuity, I think I'll borrow terms from Erik von Blokland and
    call them \"steel\" and \"rubber\", respectively. If people played with the C
    version of Spiro, they'll notice that the G4 (rubber) points were the default,
    but you could get to the G2 (steel) by pressing the \"6\" key before drawing.
    I think the steel points are easier, especially for beginners, so they're the
    default in the new Spiro implementation.\r\n\r\nIt will take a little while to
    get everything ported to the JavaScript version. I'm redoing the math to make
    it more numerically stable (not that you'd notice from the \"diverge\" error messages
    in the current version), and am also running into the fact that JavaScript is
    about 200 times slower than optimized C."

    pushing this forward. I found Hrant's question to be the most frustrating aspect
    of sketching with your tool (I trust we're seeing about 1 percent of what's possible).\r\n\r\nDifferent
    curve flavors are capable of replicating all manner of shapes, but each flavor
    produces some more easily than others (especially creating vs replicating). That
    to me is what is interesting here...what will spirals make easy, and what will
    they make difficult? Having a full quiver of drawing options can't be a bad thing!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRandy\r\n\r\nHrant:

    What was the \"dial\" idea again? BTW, I've been trying pretty hard to remember
    a certain curve editing feature/behavior that I need once in a blue moon, but
    is not [directly] supported by either Fontographer or FontLab. For practical reasons
    I guess I've forgotten what it was, although I faintly remember it had something
    to do with tangents, a different way a tangent might come off of something-or-other...
    Oh well.\r\n\r\nRandy, from all indications I have a peculiar sense of humor*,
    but as long as it's not done in malice I do find that sort of thing funny, so
    in fact that did put half a smile on my own face. The other half though was a
    frown, but due not at all to anything Sergej has done (or said) of course.\r\n\r\n*
