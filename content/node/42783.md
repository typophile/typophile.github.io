  a free font called <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/alte-haas-grotesk.font\">Alte
  Haas Grotesk</a>. I probably don't even need to point out that it's ... er ... quite
  Helvetica-inspired.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/altehaasgrotesk_5643.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'd
  love to buy a sans-serif font with a similarly gentle rounding aspect (not looking
  for anything as direct as <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/13208/helveticaroundedbold-font.html\">Helvetica
  Rounded</a>).\r\n\r\nI shouldn't mention my budget for this purchase isn't too liberal,
  so the more affordable the recommendation, the better.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for your suggestions!"

  body: "Good links, all! TDF, I think you've come closest (thus far) to what I'm
    looking for ... I actually like Mustardo even better than Ketchupa. I suppose
    I'm a sucker for a two-story a  / single-story g system in a basic sans-serif.\r\n\r\nThese
    are really good directions. If anyone else cares to share, I'd love more suggestions!
    Thanks!"
