  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>My turn for a dumb question.</p>
<p>Yes, we know that the typographic term <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[[color]]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> refers to the level of gray of a block of text.</p>
<p>But how or why did the word &ldquo;color&rdquo; come to mean that in typography. Obviously the use of colored inks in printing pre-date the use of movable type, and lettering in manuscripts were also in various color inks or tempera.</p>
<p>Was the term &ldquo;color&rdquo; actually derived from another word, language or term much in the same way as &ldquo;font&rdquo;? I am actually interested in knowing since many students don&rsquo;t seem too satisfied with the conventional answer of &ldquo;color&rdquo; means grayness.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of an historic reference and not just a speculative answer?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK, let&rsquo;s take a different approach.</p>
<p>According to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->DICTIONNAIRE TYPOGRAPHIE MULTILINGUE<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> the following are equivalent terminology for &ldquo;type color/colour&rdquo; in:</p>
<p>French &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->couleur typographique<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
German &ndash; none?
Italian &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tono<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Spanish &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Surely an equivalent term for type color exists in both German and Dutch. Perhaps the original root term can be found in either of these places of type infancy.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Very true, Chris.
Type and typography had always been part of the printer craft and guild. The mixing of inks, the eveness of printed impressions, the consistency of ink color and impressions from folio to folio, all this was controlled with great understanding of technique and technology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I find the terms &ldquo;color,&rdquo; Grauwert or tono off-the-mark in trying to describe the subtle yet complex levels of visual effects created by adjusting letter or linespacing, point size, column widths, selection of typeface, weight of typeface, and so on and so on&hellip;</p>
<p>In other words, EVERYTHING that typography involves is contained within the single term <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It embodies more than just the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->grayness<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of blocks of copy, but also the texture created by the glyphs themselves, dazzle, spikeyness, flow, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->textura<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>It just dawned on me&hellip; maybe because the &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; of the Guild kept the terminology obtuse because it indeed embodied all the mysteries of typography.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So, in comparison to the range, detail, descriptive and technical terminology used by type design, typography suffers from both lack and vagueness of descriptive terminology.</p>
<p>This has been my main point, and also the reason why it is difficult to make graphic designers aware of the nuances and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->visual refinement<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that can be made to blocks of copy.</p>
<p>Typographic training rarely goes beyond basic typesetting techniques. Why? Because it is easier to describe and even easier to implement nowadays.</p>
<p>Pick the typeface, point size, linespacing, tracking (letterspacing) and column widths and you are done.

<p>Much of typographic terminology is really just markup and proofing notation with a little bit of type design speak.

<p>This has been my experience, (except that I didn&rsquo;t even know of the term &ldquo;colour&rdquo;). Likely common knowledge here, but another thing that affects the colour of a page for me are the margins; where the block of text sits in realtion to the surrounding whitespace.</p>

This has nothing to do with red or green ink; it refers only to the darkness or blackness of the letterforms in mass. Once the demands of legibilty and logical order are satisfied, eveness of color is the typographer&rsquo;s normal aim.

<p>Totally even color is a solid gray blob - 100% unreadable. Good typography on the other hand relies on a balance of white and black, on a balance of even color and color contrast. Information comes from contrast, not a gray blob. Some people are just not sufficiently in tune with the underlying mechanics of how humans see and interpret things, and not sufficiently critical of precedent, to be able to see the shiny Modernist mantras for the claptrap that they really are; all they do is perpetuate meaningless myths that nobody really even believes in.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The way Felici uses the word &lsquo;color&rsquo; it includes balance of black and white, not even gray. Here is more Felici:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is an essential truism in typesetting, it is that a page contains no voids, only spaces between printed elements. The essence of typesetting is regulating the size of those spaces to control the balance and rhythm between black and white. This is the key to a graphically harmonious page&ndash;one with good <em>type color</em>&ndash;as well as to text that is pleasing and easy to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is an even texture, not a uniform grey that is aimed at in the idea of &ldquo;even color&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I am not saying that &ldquo;color&rdquo; is all that satisfactory term. As Norbert points out in the beginning of this thread, it is not very descriptive or clear. But if you are saying that &ldquo;even color&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t refer to something real and important in type, I think you are very off base. Typographers have known what it refers to&ndash;an important quality in type and page design and composition&ndash;even though they haven&rsquo;t perhaps ever explained it well.</p>
<p>And it has nothing to do with modernism. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the phrase &lsquo;evenness of color&rsquo; predates 20th century modernism.</p>
<p>The people who have been working daily to produce evenly colored pages know what they are referring to. It is not bogus. The question is how to explain it more clearly and fully.</p>

<p>I took &ldquo;evenness of colour&rdquo; to mean that kerning, leading, margins, type choice and size etc. all combine to deliver the look of a page in its own right.

<p>I would say rather that you are not reading what I wrote, but some fantasy of an opponent. I said the term &lsquo;color&rsquo; is not very descriptive, but that it refers to something real, and the challenge is to explain it.</p>
<p>Letter forms are diverse, and obviously deliberately, so that one letter is distinguishable from others. The H and the O don&rsquo;t look alike. But when you space a string of Hs and Os for a typeface, you aim at a quality that typographers and type designers have sometimes called &lsquo;even color&rsquo;. In &lsquo;Letters of Credit&rsquo; Walter Tracy uses the words &lsquo;harmony&rsquo; and &lsquo;balance&rsquo; to refer to this, rather than &lsquo;even color&rsquo;. Others speak of the volume of space between the letters being uniform&ndash;though what that volume is is somewhat hard to define (how far does the volume extend into the &lsquo;c&rsquo;?). What is aimed at is a visual quality that practiced typographers will have a large degree of agreement on&ndash;such on what constitutes &lsquo;good&rsquo; kerning&ndash;what, yes achieves &lsquo;even color&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Evenness of color&rsquo; is not a phrase that denies diversity, but rather tries to express in a not very clear phrase a visual harmony and balance in a diverse group of symbols on a page.</p>
<hr>
<p>By the way, your view that the Enlightenment was opposed to diversity is balderdash. Before the Enlightenment Europeans were busy killing each other over which version of Christianity should be imposed on everyone. The Enlightenment supported freedom of opinion, tolerance and diversity.</p>

<p>I think you do understand Hrant correctly, but his use of the term &lsquo;even color&rsquo; is a misuse of the term, if he thinks it means going to complete grey. It is not what others have meant by the term, as the above quotations indicate. It is about harmony and balance, not uniformity.</p>
<p>Also I might mention that letterforms have both diversity and sameness. For example a degree of uniformity of stem width, serifs etc. A certain balance of diversity and repetition seems to be valuable for readibility.</p>
<p>I think trying to understand that balance would be more productive than ascribing stupid views to those who have used the term in the past. I don&rsquo;t think they were stupid, even though the terminology is poor.</p>

<p>I think the order of desirable attributes is important here.</p>
<p>It seems logical that eveness of colour will conflict with legibility while promoting a better initial view of a page, it also strikes me that the two qualities are separated by scale and action; in that, the reader takes an initial view, &ldquo;mmm… strong rectangular form&rdquo;, then &lsquo;zooms&rsquo;* in to start reading, &ldquo;ahhh… I can read this without skipping lines&rdquo;. There may be a point at which the actions of looking and reading overlap and it seems that the overlap should be kept to a minimum, whether by scientific methods or by personal experience of reading.
So the first action should remain subordinate to the second. However, the action of reading can be disrupted by too wide a gap in between characters, words etc. So it seems that another term would be useful to describe this micro eveness of colour.</p>
<p>*not the best description but hopefully understandable.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m talking about functionality, and the fallacy of the supreme merit of even color. Aesthetics? Some people like a gray blob, others like a gray rainbow. I don&rsquo;t think taste is worth arguing about.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I fail to see what one has to do with the other. The &ldquo;look of the page&rdquo;, not to mention its readability depends on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->uneven<!-- raw HTML omitted --> color as much as even color. It comes from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->balanced<!-- raw HTML omitted --> color, and I don&rsquo;t mean a formal, conscious balance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I am not in any way sure of what you are suggesting as other. An example?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You mean an example of what I think would be better? I think typical current practice (at the high/sensitive end, not the secretaries using Comic Sans for that flyer) is fine, if not great. It&rsquo;s become that way through centuries of pragmatic, instinctive, quiet evaluation/experimentation. It&rsquo;s become that way <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in spite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the superficial, posturing worhip of Even Color.</p>
<p>A good example of the value of uneven color is&hellip; stroke contrast!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I said the term ‘color’ is not very descriptive, but that it
refers to something real, and the challenge is to explain it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s not an ideal term, but explaining it is only a challenge (in fact it becomes impossible) if you think color has to actually be even.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Letter forms are diverse, and obviously deliberately</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>How do we know they&rsquo;re diverse <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enough<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? By taking many second to identify a letter -made in a certain conventional way, mind you- at a huge size? If we really look at immersive reading, it&rsquo;s pretty clear they&rsquo;re not diverse enough - that they can be more diverse and only a certain class of type designer would mind.</li>
<li>Deliberate? You must be joking. The cases of deliberate differentiation of characters (like the crossbar on the &ldquo;7&rdquo;, which most people don&rsquo;t even use) are quite rare. See &ldquo;Canons of Alphabetic Change&rdquo; in &ldquo;The Alphabet and the Brain&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Walter Tracy uses the words ‘harmony’ and ‘balance’ to refer to this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you trying to make this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more<!-- raw HTML omitted --> confusing?</p>
<p>The Enlightenment: people die less or more depending on what the people in power want. Your cherished 20th century, the height of Modernism, saw more deaths that at any time in history. Modernism started with monotheism/Rome. It is a lust for Control, through regularism/predictability/simplicity. It does not match the human reality, at least not more than about half.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the unevennes that makes it recognizable and readable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And virtually everybody agrees with this (it&rsquo;s just the degree/flavor that we argue about). Unfortunately though too many people seem to prefer the numbing incantation, &ldquo;even colorrrrr, ohmmmmm, even colorrrrr, ohmmmmm&hellip;&rdquo; Slap them awake, I say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not what others have meant by the term</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please ask them to use English better then. And they&rsquo;re not stupid, just too susceptible to illusion and pretty phrases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the demands of legibilty and logical order are satisfied,
eveness of color is the typographer’s normal aim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why would you separate the two like that?</p>
<p>Now, I do agree that there are layers of reading - and un/even color needs a different balance depending. However, “ahhh… I can read this without skipping lines” never happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eveness in the overall darkness or blackness of the letterforms-in-mass</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this is confined to theory/hypothesis, at least in terms of function. When you get down to designing an actual font for example, if you try to shoot for totally even color, you&rsquo;re dead. Nevermind that&rsquo;s not even possible - which however doesn&rsquo;t seem to stop people from thinking that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing. Because it sounds nice. Much better than &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to strike this tricky, essentially unattainable balance between black and white, between macro distraction and micro divergence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seems like just another way of saying &lsquo;I am trying to acheive visual balance&rsquo;. A more explicet way but not essenstailly different.</p>
<p>This &lsquo;balance&rsquo; could also be described as &lsquo;eveness&rsquo;. All these terms are remarkably opaque unless you see what someone means by them. It is <em>only then</em> that you can see if you agree.</p>
<p>About this terms color&hellip; Color is a broad trerm sometimes incorrectly made synonymous with saturation. Color is actually inclusive of hue, shade, saturation, lightness, darkness, greyscale etc and so on. It&rsquo;s a big basket - a catch-all.</p>
<p>So I have to agree that using te term color is a very vague way of expressing the idea. On the other hand perhaps deliberate vaguesness is better than an imperfect word that can be more readily misconstrued like &lsquo;eveness&rsquo;. Maybe it&rsquo;s good at provoking the question &lsquo;what could you possibly mean by that&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Color (prisma) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in typography are both measurable (wavelengths, total area density of glyphs on field) as well subjective visual experiences by viewers.</p>
<p>My personal sense of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in typography comes from my person sense of color as a painter in fine arts.  I am able to see text as texture and glyphs as being fine to coarse droplets of ink.</p>
<p>My views on typography are both right brain and left brain.</p>
<p>A pragmatic view of typography is essentially the technical craft of what used to be called typesetting. I guess a more accurate term would be copysetting. It incorporates various guidelines for readability and layout, and allows for a moderate amount of expressiveness. The majority of literature on typography only gets this far in viewpoints and guidance.</p>
<p>For lack of a term, there is an ascendant state of typographic awareness that explores levels of visual perception and cognitive experience. Obviously this is non-exclusive to typography and is more often experienced in music, fine arts, performing and cinematic arts, and mathematics.</p>
<p>This is the realm where we as a community strive to be. This is where Picasso&rsquo;s admiration of Matisse exists, where Salieri&rsquo;s murderous jealousy of Mozart sprang forth, and why arguments between Hrant and Berkson colide with sheer sparks of insight and inspiration.</p>
<p>Maybe this is why <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted --> remains such a vague term in typography, because descriptions fall short of experiencing it.</p>

I mean, lets put aside the diversity of the letters, legibility, logical order, and whatever else that forces itself to be uneven, and make whatever remains even. I mean lets put aside the different faces, different body types, different heights, different quirks of each person in a military troop march, it is simply boring, especially if you have more that a handfull of pages in front of you.</p>
<p>Uniformity I can accept. No, uniformity most of the time I would insist on. Evenness makes things stale. It is the unevenness that stimulates the perception to understand the colorless. In other words it is the unevennes that gives the boring vitality, and the monotonous glamour.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is both impossible and undesirable to get &ldquo;perfect eveness&rdquo; of typographic color.</p>
<p>Though I started the topic thread, I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to describing and illustrating the methods used to view and fine tune text color.</p>
<p>One fact remains true. The calligrapher and typographer must rely on the given language and text of the document. Since the copy is a given, there is no control over the sequence and order of glyphs. Therefore the patterns and textures created by letterforms will always be irregular. Unless you were setting a text block using only a single character, there will always be modulating frequencies and haphazard patterns of positive to negative forms.</p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t dat great!
Dissonance and not symmetry is where the magic lies.
(Hmmm&hellip; I guess I&rsquo;m mixing terms here. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Asymmetry<!-- raw HTML omitted --> vs. symmetry is more appropriate. Or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->melodic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> vs. monotone is even better.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->gris typographique<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is &ldquo;typographic grey&rdquo;;
the German <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grauwert<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (way above) is &ldquo;grey-value&rdquo; not &ldquo;greyscale&rdquo;</p>
<p>All &lsquo;even&rsquo; asks for is a consistent grey-value across a textblock top to bottom and left to right in a page of pure text, such as one finds in a descriptive essay or expository text. The grey-value is constituted by the play of black and white within the text block. &lsquo;Even&rsquo; is an emergant quality. &lsquo;Even&rsquo; at the text-block level does not mean undifferentiated at the letterform construction or stroke contrast level. If it is &lsquo;even&rsquo; the setting is not disturbed by rivers, clogged with areas of greater density of black, such as might be caused by pockets of too boldly rendered double two-story g&rsquo;s. Consistency of grey-value is not in competition with the need for stems bowls and counters to have proper salience and independant cue-value at the microscale of wordform resolution. Professionally-set well-printed pages set in Smeijer&rsquo;s Quadraat, a moderately lively typeface, can have a wonderfully assertive but still consistent grey value top to bottom, front to back over many pages in its running text areas. A ragged right setting, dynamic positioning of the text-block on the page, subheadings or section marks in a contrasting weight, strategically placed running heads and folios, can give pages with a consistent grey value in their running text vitality, articulation and navigability.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eveness&rsquo; or consistency of grey-value at the macro-scale of the text-block is not a power grab of the complacent. And it isn&rsquo;t the only requirement. It has a place within a heirarchy of typographic values. &lsquo;Eveness&rsquo; and consistency of grey-value at the macro-scale of the paragraph or text-block are perceptual processing requirements for a smooth reading experience, an experience not distracted by the subliminally signaling force of non-essential variation in colour or rhythm.</p>

<p>Actually there is a conflict or tension between the need for diversity of letter form, and the evenness of color that promotes smooth, easy reading. It&rsquo;s the job of a designer of text type&ndash;maybe his or her main job&ndash;to reconcile the two. To have a lively, variegated texture, and yet balance and evenness to words and sentences constructed from the letters.</p>

<p>This argument falls apart when you take into account that lack of &ldquo;disturbance&rdquo; is: relative, not least in terms of the reader; and no guarantee that functionality is optimal, not least because there is a chasm between deliberative observation of a layout versus actually reading it. As Optima demonstrates so well, there is such a thing as too-even color, and that&rsquo;s all the evidence one should really need.</p>
<p>A typographer who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> wants Even Color will use a fat monoline sans in all-caps, in a medium gray tone, with just enough leading to make consecutive lines appear as close as consecutive words are. Heck, he might even forego blank spaces! Fortunately, we only have some people <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pretending<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that&rsquo;s desirable, and not even explicitly; when you really corner the Even Color boys with the right arguments, they turn into hot steam&hellip; and disappear.</p>
<p>The problem here might simply be the term &ldquo;even&rdquo;.
But personally I think it&rsquo;s a manifestation of a deeper psycho-cultural problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or grayness are vague terms, we are imparting too much significance to what was meant to be one characteristic of block setting.</p>
<p>For a moment, let&rsquo;s examine the one sentence description found in our own [[Typowiki]]:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>FIRST: Strip away &ldquo;typeface&rdquo; from the definition. Since a block of copy can contain several weights (book, medium, bold), styles (roman, italic, condensed) and even kinds (serif, sans serif, script) of typefaces it is only the DENSITY of glyphs that matter.</p>
<p>SECOND: &ldquo;Paragraph&rdquo; confuses the definition. It is a block or deliniated area of glyphs we are attempting to describe.
A single page can contain several blocks or areas of text which are differentiated by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (captions, sidebars, extended quotations). If our refined definition of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->typographic color<!-- raw HTML omitted --> holds true, then even changing the line measure (indenting) or justification (centering) affects the overall color.</p>
<p>THIRD: Remove any references to &ldquo;readability&rdquo; from the definition. The typographer must look at readability as a separate issue from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can make one or two minor adjustments (leading, letterspacing) that would affect <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted --> while the readability of the text remains virtually the same.</p>
<p>FORTH: For clarity, replace <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gray<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tonal value<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The terms &ldquo;tone&rdquo; and &ldquo;value&rdquo; individually have multiple meanings, but together speak specifically to the range of light to dark. Copy blocks set in or reversed out of actual ink colors (red, blue, etc.) can vary in tonal value so why confuse it with &ldquo;gray.&rdquo; Also, different ink colors can have the same tonal value, so in that instance it is HUE that differentiates blocks of copy.</p>
<p>FIFTH: Keep texture as separate from typographic color. Though both are integral, one modulates the other much in the same way melody and cadence do in music.</p>
<p>By focusing on one perceivable attribute I believe we can arrive at clearer definition of the typographic term <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (though I personally would replace it with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tonal density<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). But before we attempt it, I feel we to exercise our eyes with a few examples. Remember the expression, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see the forest through the trees&rdquo;? You can&rsquo;t see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when you are too close to the type.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good example of the value of uneven color is. . . stroke contrast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ha! I just completed a letterpress job using Monotype Granjon (digital). Had to be &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; a bit but. . .  The stroke constrast drove me nuts. But there has been a bit of a sea change in my thinking and I see your point. Faces at a microtypographic level don&rsquo;t always reveal their significance at a macro level. I think, in regard to this thread, you are dealing with the former. And that is not being addressed otherwise. If one examines Caslon Old Style or Granjon&rsquo;s Civilite, for instance, at the micro level there is seemingly some quite odd stuff that would not rationally seem to make sense, but when they are set in text form, there is a wonderful weave (color) to the page. I suspect that you are right about where to start.</p>
<p>A long while back Letraset decided to revive some of the great Czech faces but they followed Adobe&rsquo;s thinking about digitization and Herman Zapped them to death. They got the harmony and color right, but the faces just weren&rsquo;t much to write home about. They took out the funk.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There is historic relevance in guidelines to achieve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eveness of typeface color<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Prior to phototypesetting and offset lithography, there were numerous variables that had to be contended with that are no longer present in printing today.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;color of a typeface&rdquo; when set in blocks of copy could fall prey to known hazards of the trade; poor line casting, poor quality of casted font, worn, nicked or smashed type, missing or additional &ldquo;lead&rdquo; between composed lines of copy, uneven placement of spacers (inter-character spacing), and so on.</p>
<p>These were all potentially present in typesetting and had to be corrected during the proof stage. The &ldquo;eveness of typeface color&rdquo; could be disrupted by any of these mechanical variables and screening them out was one of several earmarks of quality typography.</p>
<p>With current methods of prepress and printing we no longer consider combing character by character and line by line for inherent typesetting problems. Because of this one should consider method of production and historic context when evaluating &ldquo;typeface color.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald, are you suggesting that Caslon and Granjon were unaware of the affect that their variations on the micro level would have in mass? I think there is good evidence that were acutely aware of this, and very deliberately introduced such variations in a way that both created lively, readable texture, and still gave even color. I am not sure about how even Civilite is, but in other faces Granjon was, and for sure Caslon was aiming at this, as well as a varied texture.</p>
<p>None of those quoted here claim that evenness of color means turning everything to grey. The alway discuss how to balance and harmonize diverse elements.</p>
<p>It is only Hrant who has created the straw-man fantasy of &ldquo;the even color boys&rdquo; who are supposedly on some whacky crusade to turn the world grey to satisfy their lust for control because of their admiration of monotheism, Rome, the enlightenment, the twentieth century and whatever else Hrant hates.</p>
<p>In reality, these old folks were not just aware, but devoted to making typography that achieves balance and harmony with diverse elements. For traditional printers, the typeface with its diversity of forms was already a given, set in metal, and the issue was to mass them in way that is lively but retains &lsquo;even color&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For the type designer the goal has been to strike a balance so the diverse forms of the letters knit into an even texture while preserving and emphasizing &ldquo;stems bowls and counters &hellip;[that] have proper salience and independant cue-value at the microscale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I like Norbert&rsquo;s suggestion to keep even tone and texture as two different variables, which helps clarity. However, I have to disagree that color has nothing to do with readability. As Peter has noted, evenness of the resulting set type aids readability. The point is that you have a predictable, even background, against which the diverse elements in the letters that are key for recognition stand out. If you have variation in non-informational characteristics this becomes &lsquo;noise&rsquo; that interferes with the readability of the text. (My translation of the Ennesonese.)</p>
<p>So yes, Hrant, you can have too much uniformity and that hurts readibility. But you can also have too little and that hurts readibility also. It is the balance that is the key, and your crusade against gray is unbalanced.</p>
<p>You can have different sizes of type with different &lsquo;color&rsquo; as in Norbert&rsquo;s first example. But if you mixed different sizes or colors in the same line it would definitely slow down the reader. (Of course, sometimes you want the reader to slow down, and use italics or caps, but that is another matter.)</p>

<p>Exactly. The smaller text is, the more the &ldquo;strangeness&rdquo; moves from micro to macro relevance. Furthermore, there is a threshold (the deliberative-immersive threshold) below which the reader will realize nothing - although his subconscious is still in tune (it always is). The best recent example of the power of strangeness is the new Houston Chronicle face. Lastly: my feeling is that the nature of this goes beyond strangeness, and directly into ugliness; for a text font to be &ldquo;real&rdquo;, it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to look awkward large.</p>

<p>Yes, and the best interpretation of &ldquo;even color&rdquo; is just that.

<p>Matthew Carter, among others, notes the &ldquo;famously even&rdquo; quality of Caslon&rsquo;s text type. Because of the widespread historical admiration for Caslon on this point, and the knowledge of how difficult it is to achieve a good balance, I said I was sure about Caslon. I have been sure and wrong before, but I am sure about Caslon.</p>
<p>I suppose this makes Caslon and Carter part of the &ldquo;even color boys&rdquo; conspiracy who according to you are out to turn pages into a bleak, featureless grey. Glad I am in good company.</p>

I think there is good evidence that were acutely aware of this, and very deliberately introduced such variations in a way that both created lively, readable texture, and still gave even color. I am not sure about how even Civilite is, but in other faces Granjon was, and for sure Caslon was aiming at this, as well as a varied texture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William</p>
<p>I sort of thought that was what I said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>at the micro level there is seemingly some quite odd stuff that would not rationally seem to make sense, but when they are set in text form, there is a wonderful weave (color) to the page</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d think yes, obviously, the punchcutter (rather than type designer in these cases) was quite aware of how their letterforms would print on the page. Hrant pointed out that there was discordance at the microlevel. I&rsquo;d agree. This hardly means the punchcutter was errant or did not know what he was doing. It simply means that there is purposeful discordance. Which I believe was Hrant&rsquo;s point. That this can result in a page with appropriate color doesn&rsquo;t alter the claim. But it does provide more insight, yes (?); more so than simply re-issuing platitudes passed from one apostle to another.</p>

And by the way, &lsquo;purposeful discordance&rsquo; is a wonderful and very useful concept. I wonder if the fluctuation of axis in types in the Mannerist and Lyric Modernist (Mannerist Revival) tradition are purposeful in this sense.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As Peter says, nobody has said that even color is the only consideration in type design or page design. Hrant your &ldquo;even color boys&rdquo; are just a fantasy, so far as I can see. Who exactly is in this crowd? Bringhurst and Felici, who brought on your attack, explicitly talk about harmony and balance of diverse element. Someone else?</p>
<p>Yes, deliberate variation is important to texture, and I do think Peter is right that the variation in stress in, for example Caslon, is an example. I think to call it discordance is going too far, though. Such variation must be brought into harmony so that, yes, an even color is achieved or else the variation will distract and make the text less readable.</p>
<p>I believe the reason that variation is not so much talked about as even color is that variation in form is a given, and even color is usually the difficult challenge to achieve, whether in type design or page design. You are dealing in design of the roman with two different alphabets&ndash;caps and lower case&ndash;and each letter with a different shape and different differentiating features. To keep these differentiating features noticeable in the blink of an eye, yet with the evenness to guide and not slow down the reader is a major challenge.</p>
<p>In the early days of printing even color was also mechanically also quite a challenge to achieve, which is another reason it was talked about.</p>
<p>Now it is true that you can achieve even color with dullness in page design, or type, so the challenge is much more than even color. But even color is such a huge part of the challenge, and that is why it is talked about. But Tracy, for example, talks about the dangers of dullness as well as the need for harmony and balance.</p>
<p>Now as to being discordant to the point of being ugly or awkward, I think it is demonstrably wrong that this is necessary. Baskerville is a refutation. It is an admirably readable text type, and each letter has a neoclassical balance and beauty,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t deny that you can have effective text types where individual shapes of letters look awkward on their own, but the letters in question must look harmonious in combination with other letters. If a letter looks awkward or discordant in combination&ndash;it fails to harmonize&ndash;then I think the typeface is hurt as a text face by that letter. This applies most strictly to the lower case. With upper case letters, which mark the beginning of sentences, it is possible to over weight them, violating even color, and for this to be functional.</p>
<p>The balance of diversity and evenness is a fascinating business, at the heart of good type and page design.</p>

<p>Quite the contrary! Making things the same is child&rsquo;s play. Making them different, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->intelligently so<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is what&rsquo;s beyond the abilities -but also desire- of so many. And this is why beginner type designers make gridnick fonts.</p>

<p>Indeed. But if you limit harmony to the kiddie kind (superficial formal harmony) you will end up with pointless [text] fonts. The harmony you seem to want is not the one the human reality most needs.</p>

<p>Making glyphs&ndash;or place-holders in a glyph set&ndash;different enough so that role architectural particulars and evoked form have proper salience and independant cue value, but the same enough so that they conjoin constructively on a visual wordform level, and so that the response bias to visual whole-word-form resolution is not compromised, and so that the gestalt impression of the block of text is not problematic, but smooth in tone, vibrant in texture and consistent in its attributes across diverse blocks of text and within itself, is the mark of a professional&ndash;desired by all who know their craft, exacting at both ends, and acheived by a goodly number.</p>
<p>You want to push the &lsquo;different&rsquo; envelope and that is respectable. Others don&rsquo;t, and you are frustrated that they don&rsquo;t or that they don&rsquo;t want to push it us far as you do. You think intelligent difference is a functional benefit. And you are right. But so is formal familiality. They are both important at the subterranean level of processing within the visual cortex, or so I believe. And there is no error in being mindful of the one (sameness / familiality / conjunctivity) if it is not at the expense of the other (difference / divergence / perceptual distance). It is just that your sense of where the inflection points (a term I picke up from Kevin) between the pressures lies is different from others.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what most people think &ldquo;professional&rdquo; means. Strictly speaking, it&rsquo;s much easier to be a professional (make a living, or at least good money) than to do what we&rsquo;re talking about.

At most it makes me sad. But one thing that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted --> make me angry is denial - denial that pushing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be useful - sometimes even denial that pushing exists.</p>

<p>Yes, if there is too much or it is poorly judged but it can also be said that &lsquo;Good Color&rsquo; or is also an important idea - you might say it about a Fruit or Vegi - or even someones complexion if they look healthy. This would be in contrast to having dull looking skin for instance which would be associated with being un-well or spending excessive time in the dark&hellip; When I think of type &lsquo;having color&rsquo; this is the color I think of.</p>
<p>Thinking about type as being darker in the same phrase seems odd &amp; simple to me&hellip; It seems would be easier &amp; more descriptive to just say it is darker.</p>
<p>But this brings us back to the statement already made that the term &lsquo;color&rsquo; does take on meaning over time &amp; that what is meant by it isn&rsquo;t always all that clear.</p>
<p>This ambiguity seems inevitable to me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As the dialog continues regarding aspects of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->typographic [[color]]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> there are two main viewpoints and several issues to consider in order to keep proper perspectives.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Graphic Design &amp; Typography Viewpoint<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The visual experience and adjustments are made at the macro level in regards to blocks of text, juxtaposition with other page or document elements, the graphic designer/typographer wrestles with solving &ldquo;total balance&rdquo; or intentional disharmony if that is the intent. Selection of typeface and fine tuning textsetting are the only means of solution.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Type Design &amp; &ldquo;Punchcutter&rdquo; Viewpoint<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In regards to developing text faces, design decisions are made based on how they resolve at the macro level, with adjustments and fine tuning made at the micro level. Once a typeface is released, there are no adjustments to be made by the type designer.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Issues to consider<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For the benefit of Forum members and readers who may know certain details about type design prior to phototypesetting, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->color<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was often adjusted by the type designer (and punchcutter) for EACH text point size font that was released. If one were to closely examine clean specimen sheets of block settings at 8, 9, 10, 12 and 14 pt. text, the subtle adjustments to design and widths are quite evident. Also, designers of hot metal typefaces were concerned not only with scaling adjustments but also account for printing methods where ink had tendencies to &ldquo;well up&rdquo; and &ldquo;plug counters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scaling of digital fonts from text to display settings is of major concern to type designers today, though not always apparent to your average graphic designer. Training the eye to &ldquo;see&rdquo; type color is the only way to understand what adjustments can be made.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->These illustrations<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Adobe&rsquo;s guide to creating multiple masters might give the novice an idea of some factors involved.</p>
<p>Also, the viewer must take into consideration that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->typeface color<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can only be examined based on final output or near final resolution since the subtle details are lost on screen.</p>
