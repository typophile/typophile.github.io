body: My girlfriend &#40;who&#39;s also a designer&#41; and I are starting our own
  design studio here in Seattle... we&#39;re calling it <b>tart</b> because of an
  inside joke &#40;and also because of the yummy tasty pastry&#41;. We spent most
  of the day brainstorming and working on this logo and would like to get some outside
  thoughts on it. <BR>The type is a tweak of Franklin Gothic. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39971.gif"

  body: 'it looks good small. <BR> <BR>the &#34;ar&#34; pair seems tight compared
    to the others although of course if you increase kerning there you might need
    to do the same elsewhere. it&#39;s just the neg space between the &#34;r&#34;
    and the last &#34;t&#34; that is bothering me: too big compared to the others.
    <BR> <BR>the symbol is not doing much for me as it is, the logotype is the star
    here. i&#39;m not sure what to suggest tho. <BR> <BR>last thing: i like the period.
    gives it character and this sense that this is part of a larger story.'

  body: hi adriano <BR> <BR>i like a lot, my only comments about the tart are, what
    if you do a simplify version in the tart &#40;less curves&#41;, and this is just
    an idea, but what  if your extraction looks more like a bite. <BR> <BR>BTW, i
    agree with marcelo about the ar. <BR> <BR>nice, i like it <BR> <BR>CG

  body: Reminds me of a cotton company. I agree with marcelo, &#34;right now&#34;
    the symbol seems unecessary.  <BR> <BR>When I read the word &#34;tart&#34; I immediatly
    smack my lips..... then I wonder what the cotton ball has to do with the sour
    taste in my mouth.

  body: I think you should reconsider the name if the &#39;inside joke&#39; isn&#39;t
    absolutely fantastic. Or ... if we should comment on it here ... we ought to know
    about the joke. <BR> <BR>What I see is a pretty good logotype &#40;together with
    the period, which I like too ... like the case of the british EAT. the period
    adds uniqueness to the mark&#41; ... and the symbol is a tart of which someone
    has taken a bite. I think the tart/bite illustration isn&#39;t executed very well
    ... should look more natural. <BR> <BR>I agree that &#39;ar&#39; is too tight.
    <BR> <BR>But first of all ... give us the story behind tart. As it is now, I can&#39;t
    make any meaning of it. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>S

  body: I like it. And I like it that you&#39;re not roping yourself into a single
    color combo. <BR> <BR>One nice thing about the word &#34;tart&#34; is that it
    carries at least three connotations &#40;in English&#41; that I&#39;m aware of
    -- the sour flavor, a pastry, and a hooker. That gives you a lot of edginess.
    Good stuff!

  body: The name and the tweaked Franklin type are nice and clean.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    wondering &#40;like cristian and david&#41; if the symbol and it&#39;s relation
    to the company could be made clearer to the viewer. Personally, I&#39;m unclear
    as to what message the symbol is trying convey? <BR> <BR>Hope this helps.

    I also stared at your logo design for a little bit, trying to figure out what
    the connection was between the graphic and the type'

  body: I like the name, but not the typeface. This begs for something a bit more
    fun and a bit more display-oriented, rather than typesetting-oriented. A bit more
    geometric and a bit less industrial gothic. The design seems aimed towards the
    fun and friendly, but the type is pulling it in another direction. <BR> <BR>Personally,
    I don&#39;t think the mark is such a big deal, but it definitely doesn&#39;t say
    &#39;this is a tart&#39; to me at all, but if you both agree that this is a visual
    element that captures the essence of your studio, then convention be damned. If
    you&#39;d like it to be more accessible, perhaps you should do something with
    crust and filling. Right now it looks like a bite, but the bite and the tart edge
    read as the same thing, which confuses both. Here&#39;s a photograph of a <a href="http://www.proppersource.com/images/foods/tart-rasp.jpg">stage
    prop tart</a>, which could be a good model for judging proportions of various
    details, since stage props are designed to read from a distance. <BR> <BR>That
    said, it&#39;s a good sTart. &#40;I couldn&#39;t help myself.&#41; You&#39;ve
    got an intriguing concept to work with.

    It&#39;s not a candy it&#39;s a design studio.

    need or want neutral. <BR>Thanks for the comments, everyone. Everything is being
    taken into account.

  body: How about if only the &#34;T&#34; in tart were reversed out of the cloud shape
    and the &#34;art&#34; would stay black?  This would make a double meaning with
    the word ART so that it would read &#34;T&#34; &#34;ART&#34; as well as TART.  The
    &#34;T&#34; could mean typographic, TEAMED &#40;since there are 2 of you&#41;,
    or suit you to a &#34;T&#34;.  The ART would refer to your business function,
    an art/design studio. <BR>It would still be fun and playful but at least give
    the viewer a hint as to what you do.  As it stands now, it could mean anything
    from a florist toi a baker. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: ha. ok now that peter has said that i saw it too. but ... BUT i don&#39;t
    think it matters. i like the tweaked franklin, i like the full-stop, and i like
    the pastry. i just wonder if bite out of the pastry could be more toothy looking.
    and i also think the color should be tart. like acid green or something.

  body: kinda sad if the people that do notice it won&#39;t have a sense of humor
    about it. it is like our office phone number. the boss had a thing for ducks &#40;it
    was the yuppie 80s&#41; and so the last four digits of the phone number spell
    duck. but, unfortunately, that isn&#39;t the only thing it spells. the only clients
    i&#39;ve had that have noticed that have had a sense of humor about it.

    connotation, it&#39;s very edgy, but not to the point of being tasteless. On the
    contrary, I find it quite yummy. Good choice. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
