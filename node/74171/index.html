  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I began this sculpture about three years ago now. I think it's coming up to a point where I can begin to show it off.

The phrase OK has a fundamental baseness to it. Doesn't it? More often than not a guarded inward type of expression / realization. Ya, it's OK. More often than not - OK - is a personal realization / communication. How ya doing? I'm OK. Or, OK ya I get it. Sometimes it's associated with a subjugation of some sort. OK for now. And I'm sure there are a lot of other meanings behind the expression of saying and being - OK.

So my concept is to combine the letters O and K in the form of a OK ligature, (the letter shapes are part of a stencil font I designed a while back) which gives the sculpture a guarded strength to it in a block-ish sort of mass / volume. But the expression is also incredibly open! And in that there is a want to invite the viewer and a need to share and experience - being OK. I created the sculpture that way so that the viewer can go inside the letter shapes!! The expression - OK - then becomes shared. The viewer is the letter shape fill.

For the first run of OK sculptures one version will be done in chrome - to reflect the viewer and the surroundings. Another version will have graffiti written in black and red (etc.) on white inside and out as an association to rebel and personal expression with the edge done in black. Another will be orange on the outside and yellow on the inside. And on that note, inside and outside are one. Follow around the outside and you will go inside the bowl of the O! So, the inward expression of being OK becomes a strong outward expression of being - OK.

I want to do one eight feet high and have it on permanent display somewhere!! I want to see kids to play inside the letter shapes!! In the long run I'm going to pimp this sculpture. It will be on key chains, it will become a base for tables, it will even become a door stop made of cast iron!!

Anyways, I'm beginning to ramble on, I hope you enjoy my little something or other...
