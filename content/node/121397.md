  designed by Siemens advertising consultant Hans Domizlaff in 1949 or shortly thereafter,
  who perhaps also did the script. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/DeutscheGrammophon2Detail_6608.jpg]
  The complete logo is attached.\r\nI know it's hand-lettered and not produced directly
  from a font. The repeating _e_ and _o_ are not identical.\r\nBut what font or fonts
  might have inspired the lettering?\r\nAnd what fonts since then have this distinctive
  angular formal style?\r\nVery interested in your ideas. Thanks.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

    really far from being even loosely similar... I like also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/capearcona/ca-recape|Recape]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/cabarga+cursiva|Cabarga Cursiva]] (probably
    the closest).

  body: "Thanks to both of you. I had forgotten about Cabarga Cursiva. It really does
    have somewhat of the flavor. The other fonts are also interesting.\r\nIt occurred
    to me that this type of cursive lettering has some similarity to the angular cursive
    style of handwriting that was taught in German schools as  Kurrentschrift http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurrent
    \r\nBut Kurrent lacks the thick and thin character and is less regular.\r\nI wonder
    if there are any more fonts in the Cabarga Cursiva genre?\r\nDon"

  body: Perhaps [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/brimley/|Brimley]] a bit backslanted
    and beefed up has somewhat similar properties. More calligraphic, yet angular
    scripts include [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/torquemada/|Torquemada]].

    interesting to see how it compares if it was expanded in width and the stems made
    parallel.\r\nDon"

    the Kurrentschrift possibility and I came across a digital font by Peter Wiegel
    -- apparently a revival of an old font -- that he called Amptmann Script \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AmptmannScriptAsDG_6316.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: Have you done your usual thrawl of exciting old type specimens? I'm by no
    means as much of an expert as you, but just leafing through some fairly random
    online material, the Lining Jewel Script [[http://archive.org/stream/bookoftypespecim00barnrich#page/586/mode/2up|here]]
    is an extremely angular formal script, as is the Four-Line Pica Script Text [[http://archive.org/stream/fifteenthbookofs00cincrich#page/56/mode/2up|here]].

  body: "Thanks for the BB&S 1907 ref to Lining Jewel Script. The lowercase really
    has some similarity. Also the Cincinnati 1882 Script Text.\r\nBB&S was a notorious
    font imitator, so I expect that digging through the competition might turn up
    more that are similar.\r\nBig problem with the pre WW I font specimen books is
    that all one gets is a few phrases of the font in use rather than a character
    set. Tantalizing but not fulfilling. \r\nYour research shows that this general
    idea was a font genre at least as far back as the 1880s. So digging might indeed
    be productive.\r\nDon"
