  am working on a project that requires a highly legible typeface from a distance
  that&#39;s also friendly and optimistic.   <BR> <BR>I do not know where to start.
  Can you suggest a few typefaces? or direct me to some resources that might be helpful
  for me.  What kind of physical characteristic should i be looking for in such typeface?
  <BR> <BR>Thanks for your input, god bless'

    it too.

  body: Thank you for your reply. I have carefully read through your responses.  <BR>
    <BR>I did consider Arrival, but Keith Tam is actually teaching in my school.  I
    thought it would be too easy to just pick it randomly out of the hat, since that&#39;s
    the only type that i know designed for signages &#40;cough&#42; cough&#42; due
    to Keith&#39;s heavy advertising in his type class, hehe&#41; <BR> <BR>I like
    to explore other options so i have a few to compare from.   <BR> <BR>For this
    project, the phrase &#34;Big City, Here We Come&#34; will be set in large sizes
    on the side of the street for driver to read as they drive, so i guess in a way
    it functions like a highway signage. <BR> <BR>This tag line that i am using is
    to promote an friendly and optimistic feeling it&#39;s ideal that the typeface
    doesn&#39;t feel too cold.

    a research project you should forget your prejudices, and experiment till you
    discover what works best.
