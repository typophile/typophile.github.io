body: Hi, i&#39;m a graphic designer in Portugal, and i&#39;m starting a project of
  a new magazine. And i was wondering what font does the NG traveler use in their
  Titles &#40;not in the logo, sorry for my poor english...&#41; <BR>i&#39;m also
  planning to use Farnham in text and other things. <BR>Can you help me? Do you think
  it will match well?

- body: Hi Jonas, <BR>could you perhaps post a scan? <BR> <BR>from the stampsized
    covers I&#39;ve seen it&#39;s Gills <i>Perpetua</i> <BR>and <i>Griffith Gothic</i>.
    But the sans serif seems to differ from different covers I&#39;ve checked... <BR>
