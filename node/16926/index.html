		<div class="commentbody">I have an old Epson 3000. The heads are outdated, and have some problems, but with a third party RIP I get good results. What I would highly suggest is getting something that will print on banner paper. Mine is 17&quot; wide but I can go up to 44&quot; in length, which fits large page spreads and box flats etc. It can save money over time to not use a whole sheet but only as many inches as needed. Look at ink costs over time as well, I&rsquo;m sure you know. From what I hear HP has the better options, but the RIP is very important, and the support for it. Read reviews of the various softwares, and choose the one that is most stable and/or the one that has the best third-party RIP.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I used an HP DeskJet 1220c/PS for years, and it was great &ndash; worked out of the box with near contract proof colour accuracy via the Adobe PressReady software. PressReady was discontinued a few years ago so I started looking for other options and settled on a DesignJet 10PS (with HP&rsquo;s RIP rather than the EFI one). I bought it from eBay so it arrived without software &ndash; not normally a problem in these days of online driver downloads and updates. Oh dear. HP&rsquo;s support site is a horrific rabbit warren of out-of-date information and the software itself, when I finally managed to get hold of it, is utterly half-assed. See my comments <a href="https://h41186.www4.hp.com/country/uk/en/forums/tree_display.html?forum_id=1&posting_id=54997&pageseq=328026">here</a>.</p>
<p>The big plus side of the DesignJet range is that they use dye-based inks rather than pigments like Epson. This allows a larger colour gamut and reduces problems like bronzing and metamerism. The big downside is that on papers other than HP&rsquo;s own very expensive and hard-to-find range, dye-based ink fades pretty quickly. With the new Epsons, you can print on pretty much anything and get a near-archival lifespan, and there are loads of third party papers available that are nicer and cheaper than Epson&rsquo;s own range. The bronzing and metamerism problems that Epsons were known for have now been pretty much solved with the new Stylus 2400, apparently, so even though I don&rsquo;t have personal experience of that model, based on my experience with HP I&rsquo;d recommend the Epson. Prepress houses agree, at least in the UK &ndash; most guys I speak to now actually call digital colour proofs &lsquo;Epsons&rsquo;!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a review of the 2400 <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/review/23514.html">here</a>, which points up another advantage: great black-and-white prints. B/w prints from my HP come out green, calibration or no.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My perspective on evaluating these printers is different, because I&rsquo;m actually writing the software to drive them myself, rather than using what&rsquo;s provided by the manufacturer. But in a comparison between the Epson R2400 and the HP 10, there simply is no comparison. The latter uses only four inks, of which the black is 18 picoliters (a huge drop size by today&rsquo;s standards). That&rsquo;s why your grays come out greenish - they&rsquo;re printed almost entirely with CMY ink, where on the Epson they&rsquo;d be primarily &ldquo;light black&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also, the mechanical accuracy of the 10 series (I had a 110nr) is nowhere near that of the Epson. For type work, I&rsquo;m absolutely in love with the 1440x1440 mode of the Epson, and, while I was initially skeptical that it was really hitting that accuracy, I&rsquo;m now convinced. By contrast, the HP has visible imprecisions even at 1200x600.</p>
<p>Early Epson pigment inks did indeed have problems with gamut, bronzing, and metamerism. But the latest generation is very good indeed. Bronzing can be a problem, but choosing the right paper helps a lot. As for gamut, I found the CMY inks on the 110 somewhat watery, making rich red-browns and midnight blues hard to attain.</p>
<p>Metamerism is a trickier question, and I really wouldn&rsquo;t want to make definitive pronouncements without doing spectrophotometer measurements, but the greenish cast on the 10 series may also have something to do with that. Try viewing the prints in different light (flourescent, incandescent) and see if the cast stays the same. I know the earlier Epson dye printers (I had a 1270) had really bad metamerism, so pigment is not always superior to dye.</p>
<p>If you do go for the HP, get the 30 series, which is six color and has a reasonably good black dot size - that&rsquo;ll improve text rendering considerably, at the very least.</p>
<p>In any case, enjoy! The quality of sub-$1k inkjets today is absolutely incredible, compared even to high-end pro models from a few years ago. I&rsquo;m sure that whatever you end up with will suit your needs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think a major issue that a lot of people don&rsquo;t bring up when discussing HP and Epson large format printers is how the paper is fed through the machine. Epson&rsquo;s tend to be top loading and when sending large amounts of paper through, jamming is an issue. Also does it make logical sense for a 13x19 format printer to load from the top? I never understand the logic in that construction. You actually have to hold the paper as it prints sometimes to assure your image prints properly.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Raph, really interesting comments. To clarify, the HP I&rsquo;m talking about is the 10PS, same series as the 30 &ndash; so six inks. The greenish cast in six-colour greyscale prints is, I think, primarily a calibration issue. This printer &ndash; along with the 20, 30 and 50 &ndash; has a little built-in scanning head which, as well as dealing with printhead alignment, is supposed to perform a closed-loop calibration for whatever paper type you want to calibrate for. Suffice to say it doesn&rsquo;t work and, in fact, usually seems to make things worse. Although that could be a fault in my unit, rather than a &lsquo;feature&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But your comments reinforce what I thought already: ditch the HP and save for an R2400.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I hate Epson printers - have had two and always problems with streaking, spotting, jamming. They are extremely temperamental machines and it is also virtually impossible to abort a print job without rebooting the printer and your computer - altho this is easier now. I know a lot of photogs who swear by them but mine have both been lemons. Next one I buy will be some other brand.</p>
<p>Plus they are very difficult to calibrate. My scanner and monitor speak the same sweet language but it takes a tremendous amount of work to get a printout that&rsquo;s even close.</p>
<p>Interesting advice above about using it every day, that may be part of my problem. But still, with the price of toner and paper I hate the waste.</p>
