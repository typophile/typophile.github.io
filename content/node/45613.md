  ]] I found it really interesting but too short !\r\n\r\nWhen I have to chose type
  for a project, I always rely on my feelings and lots of testing, wating for the
  love/hate Alchemy to happen and decide for me.\r\nThis <em>method</em>, mostly based
  on luck, is often time consuming, and I often found myself needing to ask for help
  on the forums.\r\n\r\nSome kind of <em>typographica best paring fonts 2007</em>
  would be great, but Give a man a fish...\r\n \r\nI know that it's very subjective,
  but I'd love to learn more about how you experts decide to mix fonts. \r\n\r\nIs
  there some kind of Do and Don't basic procedure ?\r\n\r\nAny help or advice will
  be muchly appreciated.\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Very basic:\r\n\r\n- do not mix 2 typefaces from the same family: bodoni
    + didot, garamond + bembo, futura + gotham...\r\n- do not mix 2 typefaces with
    a strong personality: antique olive + vendome, sansa + cooper black...\r\n- do
    not mix 2 script types: mistral + bello, machiarge + kinescope...\r\n- do not
    think that to look \"modern\" you HAVE to take recent types: you might look incredibly
    modern by pairing a gill sans with a baskerville, if done correctly.\r\n- try
    to superimpose your faces to check if their x-height and kerning fit together,
    it helps giving a feeling of homogeneity.\r\n- the odd couple sans-serif (titles-text)
    is very basic, though very efficient. in case of a doubt, stick to it. get away
    from it if you absolutely know what you are doing.\r\n- check out the families
    of types containing serif and sans under the same name: fedra, meta, frutiger
    (new!), rotis... the problem: most of these types are actually rooted in a consensus,
    they are not expressing much. It's cool for a bank report or an informative brochure,
    but might be weak for a magazine.\r\n\r\ndr"

    many opinions, you really have to do the hard work yourself and over time you
    will develop your own personal style. That will allow you to be different from
    the other designers, and get you clients that appreciate your personal approach.\r\n\r\nDavidR's

  body: Yeah, I used to be a bit paralyzed by this set of choices, too. It really
    does boil down to a judgement call. Usually, pairing type is done to create contrast,
    so, as DavidR points out, a good general rule is to not pick two fonts that are
    so similar they can be confused for each other at a glance.

    very much for sharing your time.\r\nThese are the basic guidelines I try to follow

    thanks for the link, one always learn something in other's <em>opinions</em>.\r\n\r\nJames,
    You're right.\r\nMaybe I shouldn't overthink that stuff.\r\n\r\nLike Chris said,
    I am sometimes paralyzed by the search for the perfect choice. I've read somewhere
    that all the problem of men come from the choice. If they had no choice, they
    would be happy. \r\nBut that's another story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I often find myself using the \"brute-force\" approach. It's a disgraceful
    and barbaric process, but I find it very effective.\r\n\r\nWhen simple reasoning
    and historical accuracy approaches fail to produce a desired result:\r\n1. Select
    the primary typeface\r\n2. Enable your core font collections that you think might
    have something relevant to the task.\r\n3. Set the second line/paragraph.\r\n4.
    Select the first font on the list, then rapidly scroll through the choices with
    the down button, looking at the changes on the screen, and backing up whenever
    you think you've seen something match. Copy the successful matches to the side,
    and proceed all the way to the end of the list. Once there, start scrolling up
    to the beginning. I usually repeat this 2 or three times, at different speeds,
    getting about 5-6 choices, that can then be compared and discarded until you find
    the best one.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "And oh by the way, I didnt say it because it seems crudely obvious, but when
    I am in search of a nice pairing font, what I actually use is my eyes and my feeling
    of \"it's working\" or \"it's not working\". It takes time but if you have enough
    experience and good taste, it's pretty efficient. So, basically, everything written
    here is true. I guess there is no easy way, just give everything a try.\r\n\r\ndr"

    Until you use a typeface in situ its difficult to tell if it works.\r\n\r\nIn
    my former life as a magazine design director, before the Mac changed the business,
    I had the job of redesigning publications. The very first thing I would present
    would be typographic mixtures of heads, decks, text, subheads and callouts. It
    it was great fun putting together all sorts of strange type combos. At first sight
    some of them were unsettling. But it is amazing how sitting with them for a little
    while changes your point of view from revulsion to delight.\r\n\r\nJamesM"
