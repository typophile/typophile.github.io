  body: The Initial Cap is Caslon Open Face, the body text is probably also a Caslon,
    but I'm not sure which one. Perhaps pre-digital?

  body: Er... of course all Caslons are pre-digital, I mean perhaps never digitized

  body: "It's possible that it's a Caslon, since that was one of the most popular
    metal typefaces, but it might also be a Janson. The image is a bit too fuzzy to
    see enough detail, and there aren't enough key upper case characters to be sure.
    If you have the book, you could try using the [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]] to see what it suggests. Try to use the least ambiguous letter
    choices and you will have better results. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
