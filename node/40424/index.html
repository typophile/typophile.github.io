  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I would love some input on this logo i&rsquo;ve been working on for our organization&hellip; I can&rsquo;t seem to get anything more than &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great&rdquo; or &ldquo;I like it&rdquo; out of my co-workers (none of them are designers).</p>
<p>Here is the scenario:
We are America&rsquo;s largest high school assembly program and we speak to millions of people every year. They have not had a designer until they brought me on in july of 2007. You can see the design mess I inherited here: [[http://www.rachelschallenge.com|Rachel&rsquo;s Challenge]]. I am currently working on changing things, most of the work I&rsquo;ve done is marketing collateral, and I am trying to convince them of the need for them to have a unified brand, to update the logo and website. The problem is that they aren&rsquo;t buying it. Any talking points that would be helpful to convince them would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>This is the logo for a new program they are launching:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/legacy_4322.jpg]</p>
<p>I wanted it to be very simple and appealing&hellip; It needs to be kind of trendy while still appealing to educators :) It comes in two parts. the actual name, and then the &ldquo;Power of One&rdquo; graphic. These are actually normally not together as they are here, the &ldquo;power of one&rdquo; is probably going to be used more frequently.</p>
<p>The type is Avant Garde.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>Thank You all in advance!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here is what I think as a design graphic student ;)</p>
<p>Avant Garde is a very-seen typo. And, alone (without &ldquo;The Power Of One&rdquo;), maybe the &ldquo;Rachel&rsquo;s legacy&rdquo; may be not as stronger as it could be!</p>
<p>I think the written part of the logo, The Power Of One, is quite powerful and efficient. It even may be too powerful for logo part &ldquo;Rachel&rsquo;s Legacy&rdquo; shown here.</p>
<p>The graphic part of the logo (the shape next to the word LEGACY) is confuse for me. I&rsquo;m not convinced what exactly it is when I see it, even if I look with some attention. Is it a feather?</p>
<p>If I understand, Rachel&rsquo;s Legacy is an organization named after the first victim of the crime at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. I would care about not using icons of violence and weapons. Maybe the O of &ldquo;ONE&rdquo; with a star in it may refer to some roundel or a target. I would even think about that some people may think that the feather-like shape next to the word LEGACY is a blood stain&hellip; :S</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not a designer yet, I&rsquo;m just a student&hellip; :(</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the responses! They help a lot&hellip;</p>
<p>I was worried that is was a little&hellip; harsh. Now that I think about it, I have no idea why I chose RED of all colors :) I think that if I changed the color to a green or blue that would soften it up alot&hellip; I also have some other devices that can go in the &ldquo;O&rdquo;&ndash;for lack of a better term, the star does look somewhat&hellip;communist.</p>
<p>As far as the &ldquo;feather&rdquo; thing goes&hellip; I don&rsquo;t have a great reason for it to be there&hellip; It is an allusion to heraldry, something older (legacy). It is also there to soften up the look a bit, because Avant Garde is a bit hard.</p>
<p>I have to walk a fine line, making it appeal to educators who actually bring the program into schools, and still making it appeal to students across a wide range of school cliques&hellip;</p>
<p>The powers that be in our organization haven&rsquo;t told me outright, but I have a sneaking suspicion that they would like me to use Comic Sans&hellip; ahhhh.</p>
<p>I will repost when I&rsquo;ve made revisions&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with the colour change suggestion discussed previously, but I find there is still something very militant about it, even with the colour change(green, i think is not a good choice if you want to avoid military) The star graphic and the choice of type I think need more thought. I agree with Robert about the logo and tagline too.</div>
