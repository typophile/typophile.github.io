  body: "Because the site search is fundamentally broken.\r\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s
    on Punchcut\u2019s long to-do list. In my opinion, this would be the most urgent
    issue to address: I don\u2019t really care a lot about favicons and the various
    eventualities of comment editing, but a decent, efficient search is crucial to
    such a great and extensive ressource like Typophile is. Or, to put it in the slightly
    more solemn words of Hugo Blotius:\r\n\u201CA library which is not open to anybody
    is like a candle which \u2013 though burning \u2013 remains hidden under a bushel
    and cannot enlighten anybody.\u201D\r\n;\xB0)"

  body: "The best solution is to go to Google, type in your search terms and site:typophile.com\r\n\r\nThere's
    even a toolbar widget for that but I can't remember how I got it.\r\n\r\nI'm so
    used to that I don't even try the search window anymore. But I don't know how
    to search the typowiki, that's frustrating."
