  someone may be able to point me to a web site or other resource. If it is the 'cyrillic'
  alphabet then, fom my understanding it looks exactly like an 'english' letter A,
  though I would still like to see how that 'A' was drawn or painted during that period.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks.\r\n\r\n"

      of a 15th century Russian letter \u2018A\u2019 (I know very specific!). Something
      along the lines of a photo of letters in a manuscript or on an Icon painting
      or fresco.\r\n\r\nThe closest I have found is the attached image of a lower
      case 'A' (see top entry) , though I am not sure if this is an accurate representation
      of letter forms from that period and place.\r\n"

  body: "alexey, the first letter you're pointing out in your image is the same way
    the  \"A\" is rendered in hrant's first image as the second letter of the word
    \"Bar\".\r\n\r\nHere are several samples all from pre 1902. I think this form
    of cyrillic A is the most interesting. (I wouldn't choose #3, because it may be
    confused with the cyrillic \"L\".\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cyraaa.png]"
