  alley--design a logo and identity for an engineering firm called Meta Engineering.
  I am trying to make some type choices and have a few ideas...if I purchase a new
  typeface I don''t want to spend a lot so does anyone have suggestions for a cheap
  Engineer-ish typeface? '

    it's an old AutoCAD font. \r\n\r\nNothing says \"engieering\" like AuroCAD.\r\n\r\nCan

  body: Interesting that everyone except F. Frank went sans serif on this one. I'd
    lean towards something like Adrian Frutiger's [[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=242570&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=50481&query=SERIFA&SCOPE=Fonts|Serifa]].
