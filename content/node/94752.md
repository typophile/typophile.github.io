    for non-latin typesetting, and whose non-latin parts are more akin hand writing.

  body: "Huge, huge amounts of fonts contain incorrect Panose information. There are
    various reasons for this, mostly due to the difficulty of producing accurate Panose
    information: to date, automated tools cannot be trusted, so the only way to produce
    a complete set of accurate data is manually, which is very time consuming involving
    lots of measuring of individual glyph features and then calculation of derived
    values and then matching of these values to the Panose definitions. Most font
    vendors simply don't bother: they either guess at values based on the very misleading
    names associated with the values in the Panose spec, accept e.g. FontLab's autogenerated
    Panose values (never, in my experience, even close to correct), or set everything
    to 'no fit'.\r\n\r\nThat said, the meta 'Latin Text' category is just about the
    only Panose value that should be fairly easily set for most fonts without measurement.
    But some decisions are also guided by bugs or peciliar interpretation of Panose
    values in applications: a classic case of massaging font data to work around software
    bugs. My guess, looking at the examples you provide, is that someone, somewhere
    along the road found that some unwanted behaviour resulted in some piece of software
    if a non-Latin font were categorised as 'Latin Text' for Panose purposes, but
    that this behaviour could be avoided if the setting were changed to 'Latin Hand
    Written'.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft and other contributors to OT/OFF are currently revisiting
    the definition of Panose in the spec, as covered in the OS/2 table. At present,
    the spec references version 1.0 of the Panose documentation, which isn't readily
    available and contains some significant differences to the <a href=\"http://panose.com/ProductsServices/pan1.aspx\">current
    version</a>, so there is a proposal to change the OT/OFF spec to reference that
    version instead. Presuming that goes ahead, it would be a good first step to cleaning
    up the Panose font data mess, but there will still be thousands of fonts with
    bad data out there, making Panose an unreliable technology for any of the purposes
    for which it was intended or might to which it might be put. I suspect there will
    eventually need to be a certification flag in fonts, by which a font vendor signals
    that a font contains accurate Panose data, and that software will ignore Panose
    data in most other fonts. In other words, the whole thing needs to be rebooted
    if it is to have any value, and I don't see that happening without tools that
    do a better job of automated at least some of the data sets, with corresponding
    validators."
