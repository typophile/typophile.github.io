body: hello all, im currently trying to put a thesis together for my 4th year in college.
  My thesis is based around Erik Spiekermann and how in Pioneers of modern design
  by Jeremy Aynsley, Aynsley writes "Erik Spiekermann has changed the face of German
  typography." My contention is that Spiekermann has not in fact changed the face
  of German typograpy, yet he furthered it from the modernist German typographers
  who had originally changed the face of German design in the early 20th Century.
  My thesis will contain a history of German typography and its evolution from Gutenberg
  right up to the Bauhaus and post modernism. Im havin alot of trouble trying to find
  an individual theory to try and link Spiekermann's typography to that of the Bauhaus.
  Does anyone know of any post modernist typographic theories i could link to this?
  Please help!!
