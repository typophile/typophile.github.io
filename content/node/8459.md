  body: FontLab decompiles the actual OpenType Layout tables in the font, but cannot
    always recompile them because of limitations in the decompiling/recompiling process.
    Subtables are not recognised during decompiling, for instance, or the font contains
    OTL lookup types that the Adobe FDK code in FontLab cannot compile.

  body: FontLab 4.6 is great for developing new OpenType fonts but if you&#39;re trying
    to modify somebody else&#39;s OpenTypes, you will likely hit the problems that
    you describe.  <BR> <BR>Also, there is no universal solution for that. Not all
    OpenType Layout features can be expressed in the Adobe FDK for OpenType source
    code that FontLab internally uses.  <BR> <BR>One of the new features of FontLab
    Studio 5 will be  the ability to leave OpenType Layout tables in binary form when
    opening OpenType fonts. FontLab will have an option to decompile the features
    or not, and when generating the font, you will be able to select whether to use
    the stored binary tables or the features recompiled from the source.  <BR> <BR>This
    will enable the user to perform smaller modifications to existing OpenType fonts
    &#40;changing glyph names, adding glyphs, modifying outlines&#41; even if the
    OpenType features embedded in the font cannot be expressed in source code -- for
    example for Arabic fonts that use GPOS lookups.  <BR> <BR>But this will be in
    FontLab Studio 5. With FontLab 4.6, the only sensible solution is to open the
    OpenType font in FontLab, completely reset the features in the OpenType table,
    perform the modifications &#40;do not reorder any glyphs!&#41; and generate a
    new OpenType font. Then, use TTX &#40;<a href="http://www.font.org/software/ttx/"
    target="_blank">http://www.font.org/software/ttx/</a> and <a href="http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/"
    target="_blank">http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/</a> &#41;. Convert both the
    old and the new fonts into .ttx files by dropping them onto the TTX icon. Open
    them in a text editor &#40;e.g. UltraEdit-32 on Windows, BBEdit on Mac&#41; and
    copy the XML code for the tables GSUB, GPOS and GDEF from the old font&#39;s .ttx
    file to the new font&#39;s .ttx file. Finally, convert the new font&#39;s .ttx
    file into an OpenType font by dropping the .ttx file onto the TTX icon.  <BR>

  body: Actually, no, I&#39;m not taking file size as the only important consideration.
    But performance isn&#39;t any slower with class kerning than with flat kerning,
    either. <BR> <BR>Note that the nightmare around untangling and rebuilding the
    kerning has to do with FontLab failing to re-instantiate subtable breaks. This
    would be a problem regardless of whether you use pairs or classes. <BR> <BR>&#34;It
    does seem to me that if someone paid more attention to the classes, the 15,000

  body: A subtile difference, I suppose. <BR> <BR>As to the difficulties of efficient
    class-based kerning, while I haven&#39;t done &#42;class-based kerning&#42;, I
    do have some experience with something similar. When we first used Plain TeX,
    you were limited in the number of kern &#43; ligature commands you could have.
    The limit was only on the number of commands, so if you wrote &#34;kern f, d c
    e o q -5&#34; &#40;I&#39;ve forgotten the syntax&#41;, you had five pairs with
    one &#34;command&#34;.  Of course, we used this with a Linotron 202 &amp; it&#39;s
    proprietary fonts, &amp; there was no reason to assume that d,c,e,o,q all had
    the same left sidebearing &#40;usually didn&#39;t&#41;, even though they all have
    the same shape. You&#39;d have to run everything off &amp; take a look to be sure.
    A lot of work. <BR> <BR>Cheers, C
