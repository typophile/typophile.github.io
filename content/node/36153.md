    creation. possibly custom.

    recognisable.

  body: "I\u2019ve got a book here that features this identity design as a case study
    for flexible identities. It says there that frog design\u2019s own graphic design
    team created this. And it says that the type is custom designed and based on Frutiger
    (which is recognizable)."

    Yves, not to hijack this thread, but I'm curious what you consider Spiekermann's
    signature style? To me Meta, Info and Officina all feel similar to the frog design
    logo. Am I being naive?"

  body: I wouldn't exactly call you naive ;^P but personally I think the Frog Design
    characters look more like [[Luc(as) de Groot]]'s or [[Michael Abbink]]'s style.
    It's all about basic shapes, curve structures and overall proportions. It's quite
    difficult to put into words, and at the end of the day it often is nothing more
    than a buzzing feeling in the back of the head that tells me what it is.

  body: "For example Erik\u2019s designs have rectangular proportions, while this
    one is more square. Check the quite wide counters on the \"g\" -- if this were
    a Spiekermann design they'd be narrower. Luc(as) and Michael have the same wide
    counters (see TheSans and FF Kievit)."

  body: "I'm with Tiff. The individual shapes are nice, but as a whole, this looks
    like a rounded, Hollandized Myriad/Frutiger with a mismatched, widebody 'g' slapped
    in.\r\n\r\nAnd Yves is right. These shapes are more Abbink or Dutch than Spiekermann."

    logo is set in The Sans, so I thought this was going to be an easy one...

    all wrong.

    He confirms that it was a custom job but hasn't gotten back to me on what font
    it's based on.
