  Webdesign) and find it difficult to close a project down. I think it's difficult
  to find websites that show \"this is how it should be done.\" The vast majority
  of websites only explains the concepts(kerning tracking etc.) and not how you do
  it. \r\n\r\nTherefore, this question: Is kerning a matter of personal taste?\r\n\r\n"

  body: When you kern you're adjusting the distance between characters so the spacing
    looks uniform. Since characters have different shapes, some must be closer together
    than others to create spacing that appears uniform. There is a subjective element
    to it, but bad kerning is usually pretty obvious. If you Google "how to kern"
    you'll find articles that give tips. You could also post an example of type you've
    kerned to get suggestions.

  body: "Yes, kerning is a matter of personal taste. Which is not the same as saying
    anything is correct. Kerning is a matter of harmonious spacing, that is, everything
    needs to work well together. Often, a change to a kerning pair shows a difference
    in one's notion of proper character fit, so a change in one kern value will lead
    to others.\r\n\r\nOccasionally though, changing the kerning of a single glyph
    does not affect other spatial relationships -- witness Slimbach's notion of the
    proper kerning of an apostrophe versus what other equally skilled people deem
    correct.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Professional type designers spend a lot of time carefully
    spacing and kerning typefaces to look just so. Generally, any extra input from
    the end-user is not needed</blockquote>\r\n\r\nExtra \"input\" needed? No, but
    quite often fixes are needed by the \"professional user.\" And by that I mean
    the professional type designer gets things wrong, usually by omission, occasionally
    by error. I'm not speaking of a difference in preference about spatial relationships
    here.\r\n\r\nBut there is no need to give the \"professional type designer\" input.
    Many \"professional type designers\" don't live in a world populated by sentient
    authors, editors, typesetters, and readers. Very hard to convince them otherwise
    -- usually a wasted effort. Just fix things and get on with life.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nThis
    is particularly true in your situation, a logo. Presumably, there aren't many
    letters involved. A type desigenr, working on an entire font, has to make compromises
    in order to get all the letters to work well together. With your rather limited
    set, and a purpose that isn't \"continuous reading,\" decisions will likely be
    different. You can can still get things wrong, of course, but that's different
    than claiming there is a single \"right.\""

  body: "Personal taste yes, but within the culture of professional typography\u2014which
    encompasses the efforts of type designers, kern algorithm programmers and typographers.\r\n\r\nThere
    are, and have been, various conventions and philosophies of how to space letters.
    Here\u2019s an example of \u201Ctight but not touching\u201D from the 1960s:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pepsi_1968_3905.png]\r\nIf
    you decide that the time is right to revive such spacing in your wordmark, you
    will have to do it manually, because neither built-in metrics nor InDesign\u2019s
    \u201COptical\u201D will produce this result.\r\n\r\nNot only should you consider
    each individual letterspace in a wordmark, and manually kern where you see \uFB01t,
    but you might also consider modifying letter shapes for improved overall color.\r\n\r\nHerb
    Lubalin\u2019s masthead for Avant Garde magazine (which begat the typeface) originated,
    I surmise, from him working with one of his favorite types, Futura. I made the
    example below to show a possible interim stage in his design of the masthead.
    The idea is that you can only get so far\u2014in certain kinds of wordmark\u2014without
    going beyond off-the-shelf type.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AGs_4209.png]\r\nMy
    apologies if this old stuff is out-of-date, but it does offer a perspective and,
    being an extreme, clearly represents the principles involved.\r\n\r\nIn recent
    years, many OpenType fonts have been published with alternate glyphs, which enables
    some customization of wordmarks, without having to \u201Ccreate outlines\u201D
    in Illustrator."

  body: "No, it is a good point Nick. \r\n\r\nAnother point is, with short copy, it
    depends on the words themselves. If I were setting\r\n\r\nWAWA BOX\r\n\r\nin a
    logo-type environment, kerning between all the letters could be tighter than if
    the two words were\r\n\r\nWARP DRIVE \r\n\r\nand certainly tighter than would
    be appropriate in the font itself, which has to work when setting long runs of
    text."

  body: "Not just personal taste \u2013 you might want to loosen kerning for a tiny
    use and tighten it for giant use just out of production considerations.\r\n\r\nIt
    is almost always necessary to consider kerning for headlines to articles too and
    certain character pairs can cause problems in a document (this is especially true
    when you encounter something a type designer would not necessarily consider when
    setting the kerning for example a numeral/letter combination).\r\n\r\nI was shown
    two ways of considering kerning \u2013\_one is to print it out and turn it round;
    the other was to partially close eyes and squint at the setting on screen \u2013
    this reduces the characters to a blur and lets you pick out the space in between.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "What about the word 'minimum' that a lot of typedesigners use to set the
    white space they like as a basic setting with the typeface and most important
    the type size involved? By the way, in a logo or in a name (like a movie title)
    you have to deal with characters as if it where individuals. The concept 'typeface'
    should not be important. Often in a logo you can alter some characters (although
    a type designer is often not happy about that) so that you are really creating
    a logo and not simply a headline or typed title. It has to become a form of its
    own.\r\nWhen a typeface is made originally as a textface, often other choices
    are made according to letterform and use of white than you are dealing with in
    a logo or movie title. "
