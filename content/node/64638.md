  do already know that the font used there is (at least close to) Blue Highway or
  Interstate:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/blue-highway.font\r\n\r\nHowever, Blue Highway
  does not containt cyrillic (Russian) chars.\r\n\r\nSo do you know maybe a similar
  font containing them?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\njorges"

    would like to retain that feeling, I would advise to look for something less regular
    than Interstate."
