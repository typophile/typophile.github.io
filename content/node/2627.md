body: Hello again. <BR> <BR>Here is the first version of a logotype for a debating
  meeting. The overlay area of two dialogue bubbles represent the stripes of zebra,
  which is the symbol of Estonian Debating Society. <BR> <BR>This concept will definitely
  be used, but I have a few more days to make changes in the logo. Lighter colours
  are have been requested for instance. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I&#39;m worried about the
  balance and the use of tilted bubble. What do you think? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23640.jpg"

  body: Magnus, <BR> <BR>I like. Have you tried small caps for &#34;Youth Forum Estonia&#34;
    and perhaps some variations on the dialogue bubbles&#39; shapes/angles &#40;more
    rounded corners or ellipses&#41;? Is the color pallette set? You might get a more
    pronounced color vibration effect in the zebra stripes with &#60;i&#62;slightly&#60;i/&#62;
    more saturation.  <BR> <BR>Very nice start.

  body: 'I think this looks really nice. The dialogue bubbles are a good idea, but
    they look crooked. Could you rotate one or both a little more than they are to
    accentuate their different angles? Or make them square to the rest of the design?
    <BR> <BR>I like the saturated colours, but maybe it would work better with lighter
    tints or brighter colours. BTW maybe you could use transparency for where the
    bubbles meet, like this example: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23643.jpg"

    you want or feel that it could work&#41;. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: Transparency at intersection could be a nice idea Jon, but there might be
    a meaning in those &#34;waves&#34;. Youth Forum is probably about opinions. The
    opinions do not necessarily become a compromise &#40;a color which is a mixture
    of orange and blue&#41;. Debates are rather battles where the opinions are waving
    side by side and against each other...  <BR> <BR>From a designer&#39;s point of
    view I find those waves a nice rhythmical part of the whole composition.

  body: You might go to <a href="http://www.wildbrain.com" target="_blank">www.wildbrain.com</a>
    and check out their logo for some inspiration.  You could incorporate the idea
    of seeing or not seeing &#34;eye to eye&#34; &#40;to communicate the idea of debate&#41;
    along with the two dialogue bubbles.

    other bubble shapes. <BR> <BR>Matjaz: I think you are right. I hadn&#39;t given
    any prpoer reflection about that aspect of debate. I was thinking merely in terms
    of trying various techniques. <BR> <BR>Keep us posted Magnus! <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: Okay, I tried other shapes but in my opinion they didn&#39;t work very well.
    So I basically kept the old bubbles, made them a tiny bit rounder, shrinked the
    darker one a little and corrected the stripes. <BR> <BR>Also we finally decided
    to go with more contrast and since the subject of this forum is the drug use of
    young people, vibrant colours fit pretty well. Maybe the contrast is a bit too
    stong? <BR> <BR>Remember that time is up and budget small, so no major changes
    will be made. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24224.jpg"

  body: Those two bubbles seem askew.  My suggestion would be to get them both oriented
    vertical/horizontal, and then maybe rotated clockwise slightly so the red bubble&#39;s
    arrow sticks out a bit.  Right now, it seems tenuous and weak to me.

  body: 'One more typographic detail Magnus, before you send these files to print.
    I think that terminals of the &#34;arrows&#34; should be defined. In this case
    probably by a very tiny curve &#40;see image below&#41;. Not only it makes the
    logo more compact it is more resistant to small sizes and on-screen display, as
    well. It works better with different sign-cutting machines. <BR> <BR>Excuse me
    if this is already done, I can&#39;t see it at this size. <BR> <BR>BTW: I like
    blue-orange color scheme more. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24263.gif"
