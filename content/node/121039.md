  recording on hmv.\r\n\r\nunfortunately the letters are set very tightly next to
  each other AND the cover also has a surface which is not plain.\r\nwhatthefont just
  doesn't work great with something like that.\r\n\r\nwith a little routine i'd say
  it is a garamond - but none of those which i tried fit perfectly.\r\n\r\nsome details
  to note perhaps are:\r\ncapital_r  \"tango-dancing leg\"\r\nsmall_k  \"harlekin-shoe
  bottom\"\r\nsmall_p \"flat-belly\"\r\ncapital_n \"leg and arm not parallel\"\r\n\r\n(source
  is a scan - so no distortion)\r\n\r\nvery interested in identifying (only) the according
  digitized font as well - if at all it exists\r\n\r\n : )[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1111_6268.jpg]"
