  a good OpenType sans serif text font that has a wide variety of fractions in it's
  glyph sets, or allows InDesign to convert keyboarded fractions into \"real\" fractions?</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>I'm
  designing and typesetting a cookbook and need more fractions than just 1/2, 1/4,
  and 3/4. I selected Adobe's Avenir initially, until I ran into this problem.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
  don't know sans serif fonts very well, but there is a lot of experience with this
  among the Typophile people. I would assume she prefers \"real\" (e.g., arbitrary)
  fractions rather than using one of those programs that simply scales down & repositions
  the lining numbers of a font.\r\n\r\nAnybody got suggestions?\r\n\r\nTIA,\r\n\r\nCharles\r\n\r\n"

    has icons that indicate if a certain OpenType feature (like fractions) is available

    foundries/distributors have different approaches; but most of them mention the
    (un)availability of OpenType features in some way on their website.\r\n\r\nF"

  body: "Besides Open Type, there are plenty of font sets that include expert collections
    which let you compose your own fractions, such as the FF Meta family or the Thesis
    fonts, or House Industries Neutraface. These fonts contain complete sets of numerators
    and denominators. \r\n\r\nI come across this problem a lot, since I design primarily
    art books and cookbooks.\r\n\r\nAlternately,  you can create character style sheets
    for numerators (I usually make them 3 to 3.5 points smaller than the regular size
    shift them up 2 1/2 or 3 points. Sometimes I go up a weight if the family has
    enough subtlety) and denominators (also 3 points smaller but no baseline shift).
    Just remember to use the opt+shift+1 character for the slash."

    move. Good habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n*This occurs a lot with Helvetica Neue vs. the STD
    version. The baseline is about 2 points off as is the size, so initially you think
    it's the fractions... ugh "

  body: "As far as I'm concerned, the only sane way is to have numerators, denominators
    and the fraction character all properly kerned, have the numerators also kerned
    with full-size numbers (oldstyle and lining) and a fractions feature set up. That
    way, the InDesign-tagged-text file can have a code around the fractions, and when
    that file is imported, everything is done.\r\n\r\nOf course that doesn't work
    if you don't use OpenType. "
