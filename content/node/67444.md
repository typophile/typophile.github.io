  to the Mystery of\r\nPRINTING.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nGREAT Blest MASTER-PRINTER, Come\r\nInto
  thy Composing-Room:\r\nWipe away our foul Offenses;\r\nMake, O make our Souls and
  Senses,\r\nThe Upper and the Lower Cases;\r\nAnd thy large Alphabet of Graces\r\nThe
  Letter, which being ever fit; \r\nO haste thou to Distribute it:\r\nFor there is
  (I make Account)\r\nNo Imperfection in the Fount.\r\nIf any Letters Face be foul,\r\nO
  wash it, ere it touch the Soul;\r\nContrition be the Brush; the Lye,\r\nTears from
  a Penitential Eye.\r\n\tThy Graces so Distributed,\r\nThink not thy Work half finished:\r\nOn
  still, O LORD, no Time defer,\r\nBe truly a COMPOSITOR.\r\nTake thy Composing-Stick
  in Hand, \r\nThy Holy Word, the firmest Band;\r\nFor sure that Work can never miss,\r\nThat's
  truly Justify'd in this.\r\n\tThe End of Grace's Distribution,\r\nIs not a meer
  Dissolution;\r\nBut that from each Part being cited,\r\nThey may be again United:\r\nLet
  Righteousness and Peace then meet,\r\nMercy and Truth each other greet;\r\nLet these
  Letters make a Word,\r\nLet these Words a Line afford,\r\nThen of Lines a Page compose,\r\nWhich
  being brought unto a Close,\r\nBe Thou the Direction, LORD;\r\nLet Love be the fast-binding
  Cord.\r\nSet, O LORD, O Set apace,\r\nThat we may grow from Grace to Grace;\r\nTill
  tow'rds the Chace we nearer draw,\r\nThe Two strong Tables of Thy Law,\r\nOf which
  the Two firm Crosses be,\r\nThe Love of Man, next after Thee.\r\nThe Head-Sticks
  are Thy Majesty;\r\nThe Foot-Sticks, Christ's Humility;\r\nThe Supplications of
  the Saints,\r\nThe Side-Sticks, when our Faith e'er faints;\r\nLet the Quines be
  Thy sure Election,\r\nWhich admits of no rejection;\r\nWith which our Souls being
  join'd about,\r\nNot the least Grace can drop out.\r\nThy Mercies and Allurements
  all;\r\nThy Shooting-Stick and Mallet call.\r\n\tBut when all this done we see,\r\nWho
  shall the CORRECTOR be?\r\nO LORD, What Thou Set'st cann't be ill,\r\nIt needs then
  no CORRECTOR's skill.\r\n\tNow tho' these Graces are all Set,\r\nOur Hearts are
  but White-Paper yet; \r\nAnd by Adam's First Transgression, \r\nFit only for the
  worst Impression.\r\nThy Holy Spirit the PRESS-MAN make,\r\nFrom whom we may Perfection
  take;\r\nAnd let Him no Time defer,\r\nTo Print on us Thy Character.\r\nLet the
  Ink be Black as Jet;\r\nWhat though? It is comely yet,\r\nAs Courtains of King Solomon,\r\nOr
  Kedars Tents to look upon.\r\n\tBe Victory the Press's Head,\r\nThat o'er Oppression
  it may tread.\r\nLet Divine Contemplation be\r\nThe Skrews, to raise us up to Thee:\r\nThe
  Press's Two Cheeks (Unsubdu'd)\r\nStrong Constancy and Fortitude:\r\nOur slavish
  Flesh let be the Till,\r\nWhereon lay what Trash you will:\r\nTo move the Work with
  Easiness:\r\nThe Platten is Affliction,\r\nWhich makes good Work, being hard set
  on.\r\nThe Bar, the Spirit's instrument,\r\nTo sanctifie our Punishment.\r\nThe
  Blankets, a Resemblance hath\r\nOf Mercy in the midst of Wrath.\r\nThe Frisket,
  thy Preventing Grace,\r\nKeeps us from many a sully'd Face.\r\nCHRIST JESUS is the
  Level Stone\r\nThat our Hearts must be Wrought upon.\r\nthe Coffin, wherein it doth
  ly,\r\nIs Rest to all Eternity.\r\nThe Cramp-Irons, that it moves on still,\r\nAre
  the good Motions of the Will.\r\nThe Rounce, the Spirit's Inspiration,\r\nWorking
  an Holy Agitation.\r\nThe Girts, the Gift of Continence,\r\nThe Tether of th' Unbridled
  Sense.\r\nThe Winter, whereon all doth ly,\r\nIs Patience in Adversity.\r\nThe Footstep,
  Humbleness of Mind,\r\nThat in it self no Worth can find.\r\n\tIf there be such
  a Chance as this,\r\nThat any Letter batter'd is,\r\nBeing come unto thy View,\r\nTake
  it out, put in a new.\r\nOr if Satan, that foul Fiend,\r\nMarr, with a Pretence
  to Mend,\r\nAnd being at thy Goodness vext,\r\nMakes Blasphemy of thy pure Text,\r\nFind
  it out, O LORD, and then\r\nPrint our Hearts new o'er agen.\r\n\tO LORD, unto this
  Work make hast,\r\n'Tis a Work that long will last:\r\nAnd when this White-Paper's
  done,\r\nWork a Reiteration.\r\n\tFINIS."
