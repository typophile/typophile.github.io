  working drawings, have of necessity been digitized with reference to printed specimens.
  Ironically, more recent better-documented designs such as Electra and Fairfield
  have perhaps suffered through not being digitized in this manner.\r\n\r\nWhich are
  the 20th century faces that have been digitized from printed specimens, with the
  attempt to create, in high-res offset output, a facsimile of letterpress typography?"

    with emphasis on rich letterpress-style color. David Berlow's revival of Eldorado
    was also undertaken without specific reference to the original drawings, if I
    recall. DB's digital revival of Juliana (which is on the docket for upcoming retail
    release this year) also referenced specimens.\r\n\r\nMatthew Carter's restoration
    of Monticello started from ancient digital data (which presumably came direct
    from drawings at some point in the evolution) but was reworked considerably specifically
    to get back the feeling of the letterpress Oxford and Linotype Monticello. There
    was a nice poster produced comparing the three versions when digital Monticello
    was released. \r\n\r\n(Of course, you could argue that the original Oxford was
    not 20th century, and so it's progeny don't qualify for your survey.)\r\n\r\n--

    I think Bill's references are more diverse than just making a facsimile of Lino
    Caslon."

  body: "Nick:\r\n\r\nCan we consider Bulmer & Dante here? If I'm following right,
    they can be considered \"twentieth-century\" faces. Both have survived well the
    transition to current-generation fonts. & you know I all but abandoned use of
    digital versions of metal faces years ago; so few came up to the mark.\r\n\r\nI
    use Bulmer quite a bit, and I am happy with its dense color on the page. Usually
    I do not care for the results when a metal face has had weights and other bells
    and whistles added. But with Bulmer I find the semi to be a useful addition. &
    some of the added-on sorts in expert and alternative fonts help me use that face.
    I was happy to see this when it came out, for I was not happy with the Alphatype
    Bulmer, which was all we had for a while, if I recall right. & even the lead Monotype
    Bulmer was difficult to make look good at times.\r\n\r\nI do not use Dante myself,
    but it appears to have survived also.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what the source material
    was for making these renditions. Maybe someone here does. I do recall that Monotype
    made a rather elaborate brochure about the \"new\" Bulmer in the early 90s. Don't
    ask me where my copy has gotten to, though.\r\n\r\nMonticello is quite well done,
    I agree.\r\n\r\nI rarely use Caslons, but I'm eager to see what Berkson comes
    up with.\r\n\r\npowers"

    far as letter forms I am following more the original Caslon--and departing from
    it too--but I trying to capture the effect of 19th & 20th century letter press.
    The 18th Century, pre-Baskerville stuff is much heavier and more irregular--an
    undesirable 'antique' effect as far as I'm concerned. "

  body: "I started working on a digital adaptation of ATF Garamond from printed samples.
    It's useable but I never finished it. Fyris fonts also made a multiple master
    version which I believe was based on scans of printed materials, but they don't
    seem to be around anymore. I'd attach a PDF of my work, but it seems that only
    works for thread originators. The capitals are not perhaps not faithful in structure
    to the original, but the lowercase letters are, and both of them have some pretty
    realistic ink squash happening.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/garamont_5468.gif]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/|Raph
    Levien]] made a few digitizations from the ATF specimen book, so these should
    qualify as well.\r\n\r\nCarter's digitization of Monticello is sweet; I'd like
    to be able to buy it someday."
