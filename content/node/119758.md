  I'm sure I've seen it before in mathematical proofs, but I never learned the name
  of the font. Thank you for helping!"

  body: "It looks indeed very close to New Century Schoobook but I think it's not.\r\nIt's
    a more \"round\" font called \"Computer Modern\" which created by Donald Knuth
    (using his Metafont, stroke-oriented font editor) to be used in Tex (another creation
    of  D.Knuth). \r\nSome versions of it have been converted later to normal TTF/OTF
    font formats:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern\r\n\r\nMr. D.Knuth
    Mr. started to create Tex/Metafont in 1977 when he was pissed off that there was
    no appropriate method/program to print a mathematical paper containing complex
    equations and scalable mathematical symbols.\r\nThe fact the sample is a research
    report and that the text has been seen before in mathematical proofs, is an additional
    evidence it's actually Computer Modern.\r\nYou can check a sample of Computer
    Modern bellow:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comp_modern_font_4625.jpg]"
