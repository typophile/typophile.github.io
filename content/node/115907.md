  body: "This is a custom logo design.\r\nAs for the inspiration for the letters,
    I see the foxtail _e_ used by  Edward Benguiat in ITC Barcelona http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/barcelona/
    and a mixture of Barcelona Heavy and Barcelona Heavy Italic for the other letters,
    modified by adding a foxtail terminated swash to _M_ and two versions of foxtail
    terminated tails to the italic _y_. Replacement of  the dot for _i_ with a heart
    is the finishing touch to appeal to little girls.\r\nDon"
