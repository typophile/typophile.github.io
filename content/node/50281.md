body: "I put Bancroft together years ago with fontographer. I'm in the process of
  updating it with FontLab to take advantage of the OpenType features. Small caps,
  OS figures and lots of lower case ligatures.\r\n\r\nI am afraid the finer points
  of OT programming are out of my grasp and I would like to at least get the book
  weight set up properly before I move on to the medium, bold and italics.\r\n\r\nAnybody
  here have the time and energy to take it out for a spin and look under the hood
  to let me know where or if I am on the right track?\r\n\r\nEmail me at robby@woodardworks.com
  and I'll send you a link to the file.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bancroft_alphabet_6446.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
  not sure if I am asking for too much here. If I am, I don't mind talking about what
  it might cost to make sure things are done right.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    probably tell pretty quickly where things are at from the raw OpenType code.

    first started mucking around with them (following the instructions in <em>Learn
    Fontlab Fast</em> I had it working and tested in under thirty minutes. If your
    test fonts are working in Indesign things are probably fine. \r\n\r\nBut like
    Christian said, just post the code."

    does seem to work in Illustrator and InDesign, on my mac, anyway.\r\n\r\nI have

    substitution to f_i and f_l, with no Unicode number. If you want to leave fi and
    fl in with a Unicode index that's fine, but copy the glyphs, name them f_i and
    f_l, and switch those.\r\n\r\n2. You should switch the double-f's first (or double
    anything. . .)\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature liga { # Standard Ligatures\r\n

    named properly, IMO. Numbers should be named zero, one, etc., with variants using
    a period.\r\n\r\nI use .op for \"oldstyle proportional\", .ot for \"oldstyle tabular\"

  body: "BTW, if you set up oldstyle figures as default (as was done e.g. in the Microsoft
    Corbel and Constantia fonts), please remember to replace then with the lining
    figures not only in the \"lnum\" feature but also in the \"case\" and perhaps
    also \"titl\" feature. Microsoft have not done so, and therefore users who activate
    \"all caps\" in InDesign, end up with all-uppercase text with oldstyle figures,
    which is not optimal. They would need to explicitly switch on lining figures as
    well, which some of them may not be aware of, and there may be OpenType-aware
    applications that do expose an \"all caps\" feature but do not expose the different
    figure styles. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
