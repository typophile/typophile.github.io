  and just wanted your fresh eyes to have a look at it to see if there\u2019s any
  obvious mistakes I\u2019ve overlooked. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/document_3626.png]"

  body: "looks pretty clean and good contrast. what font are you using?\r\n\r\nwhat
    market does the magazine serve? the second variety seems a bit softer, especially
    with the gentle curves on the e and n. will the name be over a solid color or
    be overlaid on an image in any given issue?\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of unbridled

  body: "The type is custom. \r\n\r\nThe magazine is a freely distributed magazine
    to school youth (15\u201319 years old). They write about local culture, basically.
    I guess it will be overlaid on an image, I'm not really sure."

  body: "I guess those lc s's are a bit tight :) I'll fix that. The type is, btw,
    a semi sans playing with the idea of contextual alternates to improve fitting.
    I didn't get to play to much around with it here, though.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/context_6474.png]"

    too serious/formal?"

  body: Good point. The nameplate does sort of fit the style though. The mag is actually
    more of a newspaper in terms of layout, and they use an old style serif for headings.

  body: I think the playfullness in the lowercase fits the target-audience nicely.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/essensen_logo_3636.png]\r\n\r\nSlightly
    revised. I think I'll pull in the top serifs on \"n\" for this. Style before fitting.
    Thank you for the comments!"

  body: "Left side of \"e\" looks slightly dark to my eye, but I need more coffee\u2026
    \r\nLooking nice. I like the \"s\". Overall, in the type (not so much in this
    nameplate) you might want to be careful not to make things lean backwards, optically
    (especially visible in the \"i\").\r\nMind the salt :)"
