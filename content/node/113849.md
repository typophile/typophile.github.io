  CD?\r\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/7840/10048925pt5.jpg\r\n\r\nIt is to my
  knowledge one of the first computerized Blackletter fonts, with a quite short lifespan
  due to being replaced by more \"impressive\" versions such as the regular Old English.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be immensely appreciated!\r\n"
