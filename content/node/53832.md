  to use indents, both as a relief but also to make the questions (italics) \r\nstand
  out, in order to make it easier for the reader to distinguish questions from answers
  in the text.\r\n\r\nI feel I am doing the right thing, but nevertheless, I am not
  quite sure if I am violating some clear typographic\r\nrule or making nonsense by
  doing this.\r\n\r\nNB: My intention is to avoid 'empty lines'.\r\n\r\nSo my question
  is; am I doing the right thing or not, with these indents for firslt lines of questions
  and answers?\r\nIf not, what would be the most appropriate way?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJ"

    the page if the immediately following answer-text line weren't indented as well.

    job; emphasizing the questions... or?\r\n\r\nJacob[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Paragraph_2_6196.png]"

    1\r\n--Answer text etc etc\r\n--Answer text etc etc\r\nQuestion 2\r\n--Answer
    text etc etc\r\n--Answer text etc etc\r\n--Answer text etc etc\r\n\r\nA bit like
    hanging punctuation, if you get what I mean."
