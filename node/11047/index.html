Did you use the wireframe + brush + cleanup technique on this one? My guess is no, but just curious. Also, the slope is intended to compensate for backslanting in a semi serif right? While it's balancing nicely now, did you try it a bit less, perhaps half of current? The reason is I'm wondering if people will pass over your design because &quot;there's only italics.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On a side note: Hrant, please explain in more detail the benefit of having the slope as an integer for &quot;font editing.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think some of your spacing issues are coming from the length of your serifs on many of the characters in addition to the ear on the g. I'm looking specifically at the top of the i, p, n, r, v. Compare the top serif of the n with the top of the m. I might even reduce all the x-height, left-pointing serifs to (or slightly less than) the current m. This might allow it to be balanced with less sloping. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Toothy is good. Lots of sparkle coming off this one.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; please explain in more detail the benefit of having the slope as an integer <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, you should use a measurement that's most convenient to work with. Degrees are really an arbitrary unit in digital type design - slopes on the other hand have an inherent usefulness. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example, let's say that -because of the admittedly established practice of using degrees- you want an angle of about 12 degrees. Doing a Tangent on that and then inverting it, you get ~4.7, so you would choose 5 (which comes back to ~11.3 degrees). Now that you have a slope of 1/5, you know that for every +5/-5 units you move vertically, you need to move +1/-1 unit horizontally. It's not only easier to work with, it reduces rounding issues too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, Randy has a point about the inclination angle (assuming there will be an italic down the line). If you reduce it* you will have room for more incline for your italics. Otherwise you can use the same angle for the italic, but you'll have to make it ridiculously cursive for it to stand out, and you'll still have problems - the main functional distinction of an italic (to a user, if not a chirographer) is its slant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* But not below 1 degree, or ~1/57 - or better 1/50, 1/55 or 1/60 for convenience. In practice it seems that any slope less than about 1/30 will start getting problematic at smaller sizes. I use 1/16 for Patria Italic (and Harrier) - I have a preference for powers of 2. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here is another pdf. Randy, good call on the serifs. As for the slant, I'm still trying things. To be honest, I just obliqued the characters at two and four degrees. As for pill gothic. I'll get back on it. Up to this point I have mostly done type design as an escape. It's relaxing. So generally I have avoided most of the really tedious technical aspects of producing a professional font. I'm getting more excited about things like kearning pairs and stuff, but I don't know if I will ever really get into hinting.

		<div class="commentbody">Good stuff. Like the uppers so far.  I also like the reduced slant, it's feeling much less &quot;italic.&quot; The spacing seems to be much better as well. The serifs could all possibly come in a bit more for tighter spacing needs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yeah I hear you on the technical side. Nothing says you have to do this yourself though. Have you sent Pill to any distributers? They would gladly do it for you, might take some percentage points off the royalty but after all, this is supposed to be an escape not a headache :-) In my amature opinion, you have incredible instincts for type design.

		<div class="commentbody">Christian, you don't need a &quot;perfect&quot; font - it depends mostly on what your customers expect. Emigre fonts for example have minimal kerning pairs (I think Mrs Eaves has 40-something), but a lot of people have drooled over them. The more you can do the better, but don't get discouraged from publishing your work. Plus a lot of the automatic stuff does serve adequately - like the autohinting in FontLab. The only technical skill I can think of that truly requires a good handle is base spacing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking at the PDF: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) I think &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are slightly too large. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) I think the new ear of the &quot;g&quot; is super. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) I prefer the new non-descending &quot;f&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4) Those double-dots on &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are distracting. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5) I'm starting to think that the &quot;t&quot; needs a more &quot;normal&quot; tail - and more horizontal presence. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6) Try to give the tail of the &quot;y&quot; more presence. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7) Some of the color is off - like the &quot;o&quot; is much darker than the &quot;n&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8) I think 2 degrees (or ~ 1/30 :-) is better than 4. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Christian. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Magically Delicious! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I still have spacing issues to resolve, though.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One i notice is due to the structure of the t. Given your angle, you can afford a bit more length to the left than usual, but the crossbar is now über left. Otherwise I don't find the over all structure too extreme. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also note the path gremlin in the upper case W. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like the UC. Fits like a champ. The new s is super BTW. One stylistic question I would explore were it my baby: what about beaks instead of teardrop terminals on the a, c, r (kinda like the s only heavier)? Might be more in keeping with the overall toothy quality. The others are ok now, just thought it might be worth exploring? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Randy <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(you are a busy man)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christian, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This face has the most potential of any you've posted. Once <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pill Gothic is out the door you should give it your full attention. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am not a believer in Hrant's light italic ideas. The italic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->should contrast with the roman by a change in design and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->slope, not weight. Color should be even throughout the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->typeface's styles. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant is right about the 'f' crossbar and I think it carries  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->over to the 't' as well, as Randy said.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The overall spacing is just right. If anything, it's too tight.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The 'tt' spacing (see &quot;shatter&quot;) is evidence of that. Any <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tighter and it would require a ligature. But Hrant is right on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the spacebar.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice. I like it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two further comments (preferences really): <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. The ascending 2 looks great alone, but in the 12 combo seems strange. Probably just my eyes used to convention, so it's a minor quibble. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. The overall color seems a bit dark for my taste. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ok one more: The bottom of the 3 looks a little wonkey. The placement of the corner seems consistent. Maybe it is the upward angle at the end. Typically it should follow more like the 5.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I printed this one up&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Your combo glyphs are screwy. I am not a path master so <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know what went wrong, but the 'W', 'fl' and 'ff' ligs are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->messy where they overlap. You can see it in the PDF on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->screen and when printed it goes white. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Color is perfect. Don't change a thing. Dark is in, and for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good reason. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I think the ascending 2 is ok. I always thought it was too <!-- raw HTML omitted -->squashed to be lc. I can see how it's unnerving for those of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->us who aren't used to it, but I think it works. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Looks like you've tightened the 'tt' kern. The touch looks  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ok at the small size, but any larger might be a problem. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->suppose this is a good time for me to request a display <!-- raw HTML omitted -->version for larger sizes. ;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Randy is right on the 3.

		<div class="commentbody">Looking at the PDF before and after revision, I don't see a big difference in the look of it at small sizes with the sharper or softer terminal of the c, r.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the m is definitely too narrow, and I am wondering whether the other letters are just slightly too narrow also.
