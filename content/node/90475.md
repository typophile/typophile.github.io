  body: "Thanks for helping so quickly!\r\n\r\nI was able to repeat \"maitreya\" in
    Verlag font after some tweaking with spacing and stretching of the font.\r\nBut
    \"great tao\" is not any of the three mentioned, the \"G\" is slightly bigger
    than the other characters. Has it been tweaked or is it a characteristic of the
    type?\r\n\r\nSincerely,"
