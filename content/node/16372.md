  still it\xB4s missing. The \"make parallel path\" just isn\xB4t good enough...\r\nDo
  I have to go to Illustrator when making a hairline weight?"

  body: go to outline>expand strokes. however, this gives pretty poor results, you
    might want to make your hairline weight in Illy anyway...

  body: That's what I did for <a href="http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/remington.html">Remington
    Typewriter</a>. I drew the skeleton strokes in FLab, pasted them into an Illustrator
    template where 1pt=1unit, expanded my strokes, pasted them back into FLab and
    finished tweaking the outlines there. It was a bit of a pain, but that was the
    best method for my preferences.

  body: Yeah, I guess making the skeleton in FL, then pasting to Illy, convert to
    outlines, then back again, is the best way. Strange though, maybe something for
    the next version of FL...?

    as such are not supported in any widely used font formats. The old Adobe Type
    3 format allowed it (plus anything else that PostScript can do), but that format
    has been obsolete for over ten years. Fontographer can produce Type 3 fonts (including
    strokes), but you need an ancient computer and OS to use them."

  body: I know strokes would cause trouble when exporting the font , but  a simple
    (automatic) convert to outlines-operation would easily fix this..
