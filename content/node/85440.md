body: "Hello Everyone, I would greatly appreciate your help with critiques on these
  logos. Here's the backstory: It's the logo for an italian restaurant that is reopening
  with an updated name. It will be a casual elegant, lunch and dinner dine in restaurant
  with a wine bar. It will also serve as a business lunch and corporate event restaurant
  on the side.  \r\n\r\nThe client requested a griffin to be part of the logo. There
  are 2 basic logo variations, one with the main name in print and the other phrase
  in cursive; the other logo has the main name in cursive with the other phrase in
  print. The layout and color scheme is not finalized, so I would also appreciate
  any feedback.\r\n\r\nAfter showing a preview to the client, he requested to see
  a no cursive, all print logo, a crown and implied penis added to the griffon...(Last
  image)\r\n\r\n*This is my first post, if I am missing any needed info I would be
  happy to add. I appreciate all your help! Thank you."

  body: "I really like the Perugino typeface from the second option. It alone could
    easily work as a logo. For that reason I would consider using some plain serif
    for \"il nouvo ... enoteca\", definitely not your current choice as it competes
    with Perugino.\r\n\r\nIn the same vein, I really do <em>not</em> like the choice
    of Perugino typeface in 1st and 3rd options. It makes the logo look old and it
    has this feel of a smaller Italian restaurant... of a family kind, but neither
    modern nor refined.\r\n\r\nAs far as the griffon goes - it doesn't appear to make
    much difference if it is there or not. It looks like a part of a background, so
    one can replace the griffon with a basket of petunias and no one would really
    notice :)"

  body: 'You need to make either the name or the griffin the dominant element. In
    #1 and #3 the name is clearly dominant, but in #2 those elements are kind of fighting
    for dominance and your eye doesn''t know where to go first.'

  body: "Thank you all for your feedback. I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd option
    is also my favorite; Unfortunately, the client has chosen the text in the 3rd
    option, all print. I truly think the 2nd with a serif would be the one. \r\n\r\nAs
    far as the griffin goes, it has been difficult to incorporate into this layout.
    I can't find an aesthetically pleasing way to nestle it in there somewhere and
    he just sticks out awkwardly..\r\n\r\nI was asked to redo the griffin to be exactly
    as the one in the Perugia crest. He is a bit too aggressive for my taste, especially
    to combine into the logo of a restaurant.\r\n\r\nBelow is the color scheme he
    is leaning towards... \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chosencolors_3895.jpg]\r\n\r\nBelow
    is my intent on integrating the new griffin... The colors are a bit too dark...
    I also added a border around the name to see if it would help 'tie it together'.

    ideas on what else I could try? Any color / layout suggestions?  Thank you"

  body: "I know you're working with an existing crest, but try pointing the griffin
    the other way (to the right).  Since we read left to right, an image of a person
    or animal that's looking to the left can subconsciously be perceived as looking
    backwards. \r\n\r\nAnother option might be to have 2 small griffins, one on each
    side, looking towards the center. This might not work as well but I'm just mentioning
    it as another approach.\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned, the colors are dark. Try printing
    the logo in the size it'll appear on the menu, and then sit at the darkest table
    in the restaurant and see if the logo is still legible."

  body: "i think you have overcooked it with the typography. You have in effect used
    2 display fonts in 3 lines, looks messy, I  would suggest you substitute the font
    top and bottom lines for something a simple like a condensed bold sans font with
    some letterspacing through it.\r\n\r\nThe main line has some weird widths on the
    letters, the R really wide compared to the U and the O, the general effect is
    it all looks jammed in, and does not read well.\r\n\r\nIf you are stuck with that
    image of the griffon, I would suggest you use the solid version, it looks cleaner
    and more modern. try using the griffon in the light grey on the dark grey background.
    Position the griffon over to the left as in the first sample and make it bigger.
    then have the lettering positioned to the left of it coming flush right up to
    the griffon. This will take you eye into the griffon, and all the components will
    function as one piece. This layout is more modern than the centred version. see
    suggest version attached[img:sites/default/files/old-images/griffonblog_4622.jpg]"

    logo to be legible and easily put into a sign format. As that is the often way
    people find a restaurant... driving by, being intrigued by the building and logo
    and deciding to try it. (of course word of mouth is even more powerful, but drive-bys
    are still important). \r\n_______________\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pakka.com.au/brochures.html\"

  body: "(Warning: Amateur opinion)\r\n\r\nTo me, the greatest problem with the original
    poster's designs are the lack of contrast. The dark reds and purples are as good
    as invisible on the dark grey background. The gold-on-maroon of the second image
    is pretty, though.\r\n\r\nI agree the cursive font is prettier than the caps,
    but it reads \"ferugino\" to me... \r\n\r\nHaloguy's arrangement is definitely
    more balanced and harmonious than the previous ones. I'd probably make the three
    text lines evenly spaced, though (which may be an beginner's mistake on my side?),
    and either increase the contrast between the griffin's outline and fill color,
    or remove the outline."

    fonts is also good but you need to solve spacing issue in this logo from bottom..

    across this old thread. I hadn't noticed there were more comments! I really appreciate
    all your feedback (positive, negative and constructive criticism) \r\n\r\nAs a
    response to how it ended up looking, that is a very very bad representation on
    how it turned out. I am currently working with the business to hire a talented
    web designer to improve the quality of their site and design. \r\n\r\nEven though
    some responses were \"late\" i am very grateful for your input. If anyone has
    any advice on how to deal with clients who are set on what they want even though
    the designer might have better ideas I would really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nThank
    you\r\n"
