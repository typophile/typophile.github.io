body: "I'm one of the far too many non-Greeks trying to come up with a decent Greek
  text face. \r\n\r\nI dislike latinization, and I also dislike the clash between
  Roman uppercase and Greek lowercase letters. After reading http://typophile.com/node/15819
  (Nick: Non-common Greek Caps), I sketched together some Greek caps in the same style
  as the lowercase. \r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the PDF.\r\nIs it too exotic? Too
  informal? Does it ruin the relationship with the Roman entirely?\r\n\r\nI just want
  to get an idea whether this is worth pursuing.\r\n\r\n(If anyone wants to play with
  the font, I can upload that too.)"

    Roman, I think you aren\u2019t. No more than any proper italic does, in any case."

  body: "Wow. Looks like you put a great effort in the Greek. I don't know anything
    bout it, but, purely aesthatically, I like it. In the 'normal', the serif on top
    of stems (in /i n p r, etc.) could use a little more overshoot. It doesn't optically
    align with the shoulder/bowl currently. If you just raise it a couple units, the
    white space between the bowl and the top of the stem will also increase, which
    is good for legibility.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper"

  body: "Sorry to drift off topic, but be wary of the similarity between your typeface
    and Minion Pro. I prefer yours as it is, so you don't need to move away from Minion,
    but just keep it in mind. And what I said about the serifs on top of stems can
    be seen clearly in Minion. Compare the top of your /n/ and the top of Minion's
    /n/ and you'll see it.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture2_6034.png]"

  body: "Thanks Jasper!\r\n\r\nOut of the question, it turned into a very Minion-y
    typeface. And that wasn't even on purpose; I started out with something that looked
    almost like a Baskerville, started changing things around, and then later realized
    \"oh, now it's Minion!\"\r\n\r\nYou're absolutely right about the overshoots.
    I'll fix that.\r\n\r\nAnyone mind commenting on the Greek caps, though? :-)"

    a bit more weight along its leg, especially nearing the bottom.\r\n- Eta could
    be a little bit wider.\r\n\r\nI know nothing about Greek though. Other than what
    I just mentioned I think they look amazing!"
