  body: "Stephan Gandl's previous masterwork was entitled Designershock the users
    manual. Co-authored with Rob Meek and Birte Ludwig. The \"system\" came with a
    CD which enabled one to boot into their website and to play video-games to win
    font families which the DS team had designed. This is the only design book which
    managed to convince me of the utility of video-games. You should be able to find
    more info at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.designershock.com/\r\n\r\nand if you don't have
    a copy of the DS manual, I'd certainly encourage you to find one. It is a rather
    lovely book, in which the cover doubles for mouse-pad.\r\n\r\nbest wishes,\r\n\r\npete"
