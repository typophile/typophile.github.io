The flop is the beginning of the second round of betting. The first player to the left of the dealer goes first (but remember that if small dark still in the game, it is always the player will decide first) .
http://bonuswithoutdeposit.eu
And again , remaining players have three options : fold, call or zabetować (note that from now on every raise is considered a bet. During the first round of the MC and DC represent the blinds , which other players can conquer ) .
After all plants , the round ends flop , the dealer ' burns ' the card and puts next to the table , which is called the Turn. This card initiates the 3 round of betting. As in the earlier rounds , the first player to the left of the dealer starts by selecting the belt , check or assumes a given amount of chips. This happens until all players take decisions and it ends with a 3 round .

When all bets are completed , players on the left of the dealer button start sequence to show their hidden cards . At this point, all the other players share five cards face up on the table , but they can create better combinations using his one or two hidden cards ( with a combination of 3 or 4 cards from the table ) .

The pre-flop can check BB , which has dropped its bid to pool enough to tell check to access the flop phase . The phases of the flop , turn and river , we can see when our turn came in the bidding and no one before us has raised rates ( bet ) . Bet - it's actually the same as a raise - is taking place in phases flop , turn and river when no one before us not to increase rates ( we do this as the first ) .

Note ! - In the example above, there is such indications as 23o or KTs . 23 is just two and three , KT is the king and ten ois are respectively : off -suit ( in different colors ) and suited ( in the same color .) --- Flop --- In the flop on the table there will be 3 card. These are called community cards , as they are common to all players. Each player uses two cards that is in hand and the community cards to create the strongest possible hand. A second round of betting , which looks identical to pierwsza.Wróćmy to our example : The board ran out following the card

At the initial stage of your career you will probably play low- stakes limit with blinds order of $ 0.5 / $ 1.Wracając to play. SB and BB have to toss your chips into the pot whether they want to or not, and that before they see their cards (hence the name of the blind) . This is to ' stimulate ' the game and circulation pieniądza.Kiedy blind'y are already in the pot , dealt cards - each player receives two . Then we have the first phase of the auction. We begin with the player sitting to the left of BB and end when the contribution of each player to the pool is identyczny
