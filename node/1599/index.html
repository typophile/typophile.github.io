We're probably the most traffic she's gotten this past year. <BR> <BR>Also, I did not say there was anything wrong with you; please reread my original statement before taking things to the level of ad hominem. <BR> <BR>Now that being said, I could see it if she had tens or hundreds of fonts and was advertising &quot;FREE FONTS HERE&quot;, but she wasn't.

		<div class="commentbody">I disagree with your final analysis, Chris. I think the full potential ramifications of distributing fonts illegally should be plainly stated up front. This is not a threat, it is a warning of legal culpability, and it should be delivered 'your first time up to bat'. Stringing someone along in a protracted negotiation about their offering of someone else's property without warning them in no uncertain terms of the consequences of their actions is not doing them any favours. While you're faffing around trying to be nice, someone else might have already alerted Monotype, without benefit of a warning.</div>

Ultimately, it wasn't even an issue, as the band had already parted ways, but the whole thing could have been resolved nicely had the guy just said, &quot;You know, I have a band with the same name. Are you guys still together? Because we are, and we want to use the name we've recorded under since 19XX.&quot; He presumed that there would be a fight, rather than presuming that they could talk like adults and come to an understanding. <BR> <BR>I'm interested to see if she'll respond, and if so, how she'll respond.</div>
