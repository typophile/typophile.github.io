body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dutch Antiqua II_6665.jpg]\r\nI started
  drawing this Dutch-sort-of text serif. \r\n\r\nInfluenced by classical 16th-18th
  century Dutch and French designs by Plantin, Haultin, Fleischmann, Rosart and Fournier,
  and also drawing inspiration from modern interpretations like Renard, Collis, Dolly
  and Arnhem. I drew this from the inside out, starting with the counterspaces as
  an experiment in getting the glyphs to click widthwise.\r\n\r\nThis is intended
  as a book face at 9pt. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dutch Antiqua_3481.jpg]\r\n\r\nAt
  this early stage, what I'm mostly worried about is that there may be too many things
  going on. The caps and lowercase are quite different in style, not sure if that
  can work. If the two cases need reconciling more, which features should I change?
  \r\n\r\nAlso, do the caps need a bit more height?"

    little would help too.\r\n\r\nLooks great."

    will be great for the point size and extended copy. Maybe the lower left contour
    of the /G/ could use more weight: not bolder, just lower."

  body: I think the top of the bowl of the p is too heavy. It stands out, not only
    because it's a dark spot, but also by making the counter noticeably low.
