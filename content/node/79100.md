  so they look right in Lithuanian? I gather the nosin\u0117 should be more or less
  visually centered below the letter as a whole. But does it attach to the right serif
  (right extension of the serif) or to the center of the serif? Or does it not really
  matter?\r\n\r\nIn most typefaces, the ogonek attaches to the center, but I have
  seen instances (especially bold cuts) where it was put more to the right. Any Lithuanians
  here who can clarify?"

    Native North American languages, where it is connected to the bottom middle. For
    Polish and Lithuanian, I'm using connections at right, except for |A|. Ogoneks
    at middle of |I|i| stem seems to have a weak link with the base letter and broke
    the flow ogonek curve produces.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ogos_6714.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Some
