Storm allows modication for internal use, Linotype expessly forbids it. <BR> <BR>I think I _should_ be allowed to modify a font for my use, and I should be allowed to embed it. <BR> <BR>Font Bureau, and lots of others, require a separate agreement for embedding. This seems inequitable: I don&#39;t see why McDonald&#39;s should be able to buy, say...Whitman, and put it on their placemats coast to coast for less than it would cost me to distribute teacher&#39;s guides for my children&#39;s theatre productions as PDFs.  <BR> <BR>But I know it&#39;s their call, so I use Adobe fonts for my study guides. <BR> <BR>My $.02 CDN.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">With regards to standardizing EULAs, there are two things that come to mind: <BR> <BR>First, standardizing the &#42;language&#42; of a EULA might be done without standardizing the actual &#42;content&#42; of a EULA. It seems to me these are two different things. <BR> <BR>Second, standardizing the content of EULAs across foundries might run afoul of anti-trust laws. So it&#39;s not something I would pursue without consulting a lawyer. &#40;Heck, even standardizing the language might be dangerous, though I can&#39;t see why.

		<div class="commentbody">I just finished an article on the embedding of fonts &#40;web and PDF&#41; for the Dutch magazine Publish. The reason was a dispute between a designer, the customer of the designer, the font distributor and the legal advisor of the Dutch Association of Graphic Arts Designers BNO. <BR>It was a technical/legal problem and the designer &#40;and the association of designers&#41; blamed the distributor to provide poor information on the subject of embedding, subsetting and additional client-licenses for service applications. <BR>The distributor sold fonts from some twenty sources with mostly different EULA&#39;s. <BR>The user hates to read one EULA; how about twenty? <BR>Designers would like a list of differences on each of the relevant conditions such as embedding allowed, subsetting requested, web embedding allowed, 5-cpu license, multi user license, multi site license, output only license etc. etc. <BR>I agreed with the association of designers BNO to do some investigation on the different forms of licenses and conditions &#40;EULA&#39;s&#41;. I agreed to do the basic research and will send an e-survey &#40;in the English language&#41; to font producers within short. <BR>Most typefoundries in the Netherlands &#40;as you know we have a few&#41; agreed to cooperate. <BR>Adobe, Agfa-Monotype and Linotype sponsored my earlier publication on that subject in 2001. <BR>If interested I will send you the documents on this new survey and publication later this year. <BR>Regards, Henk Gianotten <BR>Giarte Media Group BV <BR><!--attachment: Fontsand_illegal_softwareUS-20830.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*32.9*Fonts+and+illegal+software*Fontsand%26%2340%3billegal%26%2341%3bsoftwareUS%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">Fonts and illegal software<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4102/Fontsand_illegal_softwareUS-20830.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Fontsand&#40;illegal&#41;softwareUS.pdf</b></a> (32.9 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">John said: I _try_ to avoid any EULA that doesn&#39;t allow embedding, but it gets hard.  <BR> <BR>Its not just the EULA though. I&#39;ve had to hack into font files to change the embedability settings so that I can use them as per the agreement. I&#39;ve also done this with font files which have a EULA which forbids embedding, but when I ask the vendor/foundry they say that my circumstances don&#39;t require a special licence, but the software I use will only let me embed embedable fonts. <BR>&#40;See the level of paranoia here - I have to post under an anonymous persona, even though I&#39;ve only used fonts in the way I&#39;ve been entitled to. I just think that as soon as I admit to hacking around with font files someone will be on my back. Am I right to be so paranoid?&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Simon, thanks for the elaboration. Coming at this from an end-user standpoint, my initial reaction is that  this is unnecessarily convoluted. <BR> <BR>What is the real argument for controlling how or where fonts get embedded? I&#39;ve always understood it to be a protection against piracy, but stipulating different arrangements based on the distribution of a product sounds like a different game. It sounds a lot more like &#34;rights managed&#34; stock photography. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not trying to argue for or against tighter font embedding controls... I honestly want to know why,  from the foundry / type designer perspective, it&#39;s a good business practice.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">There is quite a lof of debate on the embedding question, partly involving protection against piracy, but also regarding the value added to things like electronic books by inclusion of fonts. There is a recognition that value is being added by font embedding, and that this value is not fixed but depends on the ways in which the embedded font can be utilised. For example, does the embedded font simply display the text, or can the embedded font be copied with text into annotations or comments? If the document includes specialised characters, there is a legitimate need to be able to display these in annotations, but then the reader of the document may also become a <i>user</i> of the font. So distributing a commercial ebook with an embedded font may be seen as distribution of that font, not simply as distribution of something made with that font as in the case of a paper book. So yes, rights management is something that is likely to be applied to fonts in future, in which users will pay different amounts depending on the collection of rights that they want to purchase, i.e. on how they want to use the fonts. The good side of this is that it will offer more flexibility in pricing, and may make fonts less expensive for some uses; however, without a serious rights management system this would lead to a lot of confusion. In other words, simply relying on people to read a EULA to know what they can and cannot do with a font is not sufficient, especially if you are trying to tailor EULA&#39;s to individual user rights. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have a problem with the idea of standardising a kind of boilerplate EULA for typical retail font distribution by companies with large libraries. I think the situation for small foundries may be more complicated. In the future, my own company will be distributing fonts under a number of different license agreements, some of which are unique to particular fonts and reflect agreements with the original clients. We will have some families in which different fonts will be covered by different licenses, because some fonts will be freely redistributable and others will not. The idea of a standardised EULA is really too simplistic for us.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John &#40;and all&#41; &#62;&#62;&#62; From your comments, I have a few of my own. IMHO fonts are a value add at step one. I don&#39;t license type if I don&#39;t think it will add to the work I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m wondering if the difference between perhaps TV, Print and Film work vs. Internet, PDF, EBook &#40;embeddable formats&#41; is the main difference. Is this what you were saying? Maybe I&#39;m over-simplifying. But, in your opinion, would you say anytime a font is embedded it is more than just a value add? Is it more because the font is being put in a risky environment where it can be extracted?  <BR> <BR>All &#62;&#62; Maybe I&#39;m thick, but doesn&#39;t subsetting protect in anyway. Someone could explain that to me. The PDF format has become a way of life. Proofing, Comping, final versions for newspapers and magazines &#40;who almost always require this format now&#41;.  <BR> <BR>It is one thing to have another license for embedding in files for resale. That makes sense and I understand that. But, we live in a day and age where PDFs are vital. Even sending PDFs to press &#40;or service bureau&#41; saves us &#40;the designer&#41; from having to worry about other elicit behavior. I&#39;m lucky. I happy to have a service bureau to which I am connected by network. Which brings up another question ... <BR> <BR>Unlimited Output devices? Meaning, unlimited as long as it isn&#39;t something for resale. &#40;again, I understand that&#41; I think it is safe to say that we also live in a day and age where most designer&#39;s &#40;in studio environs at least&#41; have more than one printer to which they are connected. Which leads to another question ... <BR> <BR>Derivative work? I&#39;m confused. So if I typeset a line of type on a curvy path in illustrator &#40;whether I turn it to outlines or not&#41; and place this into my InDesign file. Am I suddenly breaking my EULA agreement? Maybe someone can explain this to me. I&#39;m hoping Nick Shinn answers too. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>And while I&#39;ve brought up the EPS file format. Let&#39;s say I design a poster in illustrator. All type to outlines. Send this to the Service Bureau. Is this violating any agreements. I&#39;ve read a few EULAs there are actually some that say I cannot do this. Why? I&#39;m not even embedding any fonts into the file. <BR> <BR></div>

It seems to me as long as foundries are not allowing embedding, even for print or view only files, the PDF isn&#39;t going to be completely usable by designers. <BR> <BR>Now, I&#39;m realistic. The PDF format is not in trouble. It is the most useful thing since sliced bread. Or at least instant messaging.

		<div class="commentbody">Sure, &#34;Final Form PDF&#34; is possible. But the only people who would actively want to use it are type foundries, and it doesn&#39;t fundamentally protect their work except when they&#39;re doing it. Sure, they could do a EULA that only allows &#34;Final Form PDF&#34;; but it wouldn&#39;t help with docs that only have one font in them. So there would still be &#42;some&#42; PDFs that would be &#34;problematic.&#34; <BR> <BR>The thing is, nobody has ever demonstrated that there is a noticeable real-world piracy problem with fonts embedded in PDF. Sure, it&#39;s possible to extract fonts from PDFs. But it&#39;s just much easier to just get them off of pirate newsgroups or the like. By and large, nobody&#39;s bothering to steal them from PDFs, except for people from the type industry who just want to prove that it&#39;s possible and not all that difficult. <BR> <BR>All that being said, if there were a strong desire from the type industry as a whole to have &#34;final form PDF&#34; per this definition, I would certainly ensure that it got circulated to the decision-makers on the Acrobat team. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>What&#39;s the difference between not subsetting, and subsetting at 99%?</i> <BR> <BR>Setting Acrobat to subset if anything up to 99% of the glyphs in the font are used means effectively that subsetting always happens. You probably are not using 99% of the glyphs, but whatever percentage you actually use, subsetting will automatically happen. The default subsetting limit in Acrobat 3.0 was 10%, so if you used more than 10% of the glyphs the whole font would be embedded. Adobe changed this default in later versions in response to requests from the font industry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Thomas,  <BR>thanks for the explanation. <BR>I think my observations were right. You confirm that at this moment these tools &#40;generally&#41; don&#39;t allow editing.  <BR>In your next sentence you mention that users should expect that future tools might do this with an &#34;editable flag font&#34;. But these tools are not yet available.  <BR>So it will be wise to invest in editable fonts even if these fonts would cost more money compared to &#34;Print &amp; preview&#34; versions if you can give the guarantee that these embedded editable fonts could be used for &#40;what Adobe calls&#41; Full text editing capabilities? <BR>Right now &#40;in Acrobat 6.0&#41; one needs installed fonts &#40;editable or print &amp; preview versions&#41; to conduct those full editing tasks in print files, such as PDF/X-1:2001.  <BR>If BSA controls the fonts they won&#39;t take care of embedded fonts but check only the installed ones. And these can &#40;at this moment&#41; only be the ones the &#34;editor&#34; legally owns. <BR>If you can guarantee that &#40;future&#41; availibility of those tools and the allowance to use them in Acrobat 6.0 it would mean that investing in an additional fee for the editable-flag versions of a typeface is not a waste of money. <BR>And the proud owner who paid more for the editable version of a font just has to wait a while. <BR> <BR>Some EULA conditions &#40;this tread by the way!&#41; describe that the rights to edit at the recipients side could be delivered by just a legal document. They would not deliver the editable flag version fonts &#40;or replace them&#41; but just deliver the legal allowance additional to the print &amp; preview font. <BR>That would mean that one still has to transport those fonts without the editable flag from the creator the the processor. Because the processor has to use those installed &#40;print &amp; preview&#41; fonts. <BR>There is however no &#34;proof of purchase&#34; in such a case to show the legal rights. <BR> <BR>Could you give some more info on those future tools wich might do what you describe? <BR>regards, Henk <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I&#39;d say that if you think you would want such capabilities if they were available, you should buy fonts that permit it, both in terms of the embedding settings and the EULA. <BR> <BR>What a user is legally allowed to do is dependent on the EULA. The embedding settings are a separate issue, creating a maximum ceiling on what other software ought to let one do with a font. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t really comment on the capabilities of future PDF editing tools, whether from Adobe or third parties. I was simply observing that it was reasonable to guess that such tools will become more capable, and will tend to respect the embedding settings of fonts. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll also note that Adobe for one does not charge more for fonts that are set to &#34;editable embedding.&#34; However, pricing is a matter for each type foundry to decide. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;ll just add that this is definitely an area where there is no common or standard license. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also worth noting that licenses change over time. For example, some large foundries that used to permit modifications for your internal use, have stopped doing so in recent years. I suspect you are bound by the license you agreed to at the time of purchase, regardless of what the current license says &#40;though I&#39;m not a lawyer, and this is really a legal question&#41;. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>If I understand Emilie&#39;s question, she&#39;s asking about making a logotype, not a font for redistribution. Right? Then this is a non-issue. Hack away and more power to you!</i> <BR> <BR>This actually depends on how you make the logotype. If you use the font in e.g. Illustrator, convert to outlines and then edit those outlines or even import them into a font editing program, you are not contravening any EULA that I know of. But if you open the font itself in a font editing program then you need to be more aware of the EULA terms re. decompilation and modification. &#39;Courier New&#39;, if obtained as part of the Windows OS, is a system component covered by exactly the same EULA as all the other software that makes up the OS. <BR> <BR>When we talk about whether font EULAs should be standardised, we should be clear that we are referring specifically to retail font licenses. There is a whole world of font development and distribution that has nothing to do with the retail market, and for which the typical terms of retail license agreements do not apply. If a font is developed as a component of an operating system or other software package, I don&#39;t think we should assume that we can treat it the same way as a font that is developed and sold as a product in itself.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, <BR>It seems to take forever for posts even on broadband.  I always get some sort of an error message saying either that page was not available or timed out or could not be found.  I check a few minutes later to find my post was made after all.  It sounds like some sort of a technical issue at the server site.  The first few times I would double post but now I know it is just a burp in the system. <BR>Besides Hrant, if they were screening your posts, they would need a staff of 50 volunteers to keep up with you :-&#41; <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>
