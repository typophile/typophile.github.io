  starting out. Since I'm doing graphic design now, everybody suddenly wants my advice
  for their birthday invitations etc. Most of the time I'm able to help them, but
  now I've got a question I don't have an answer to.\r\n\r\nMy dad needs a font for
  text that contains a lot of numbers. I've spoken to him about it and showed him
  some fonts that are already on his computer, like Georgia which has text figures
  (old style/hanging numbers). He didn't like the that there's only a bold, a regular
  and an italic, as he needs a semi-bold as well... I am willing to pay for a good
  typeface with old style numbers, as I think I'll be able to use it in coming years
  anyway, but it shouldn't be too exclusive/expensive as I am a student.\r\n\r\nWhat
  he needs:\r\n- Serif\r\n- Old style numbers\r\n- Regular, semi-bold, bold and italic\r\n-
  Will be used for 10 or 11 pt text and printed out, legibility is important\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any suggestions? \r\n\r\n- Eline"

    is also an option and mch cheaper, but I think it's a bit overused."

  body: There's also Venturis ADF, an LPPL-licensed fork from [[http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/|Arkandis
    Digital Foundry]] of the Utopia that Adobe handed to TUG. Definitely at a student-friendly
    price. Definitely a bit of an oddball, almost... exclusive.

  body: "Wait, does he need the typeface or do you? \r\nIf he wants it for his computer
    he should be licensing it (so you shouldn't have to pay for it, I mean).\r\n\r\n<cite>\"text
    that contains a lot of numbers\"</cite>\r\nCan you tell us a little more about
    the sort of text this is? That would make it easier, presumably, to give good
    recommendations.\r\n(Since you mention oldstyle figures it seems that you want
    the numbers to \xABblend in\xBB to the text? This sure makes sense for a text
    intended to be read continuously, but bear in mind that in some texts you want
    numbers to jump out a bit more, to be more immediately visible when quickly scanning\u2026)"

    need to handle a lot of numbers usually imposes dificulties in most fonts. Some

    question about to properly handle massive number usage in various scenarios was
    one of the main reasons I did begin to design my own [[http://www.typophile.com/node/67787|font]]
    (the other was to handle texts with many acronyms).\r\n"
