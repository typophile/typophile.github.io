  to show my collection of unique fabric typography at TypeCon last week.\r\nI have
  put together a blog with some examples of the collection for those that couldn't
  attend and I hope you enjoy seeing a taste of what I have\r\n\r\nwww.textiletrademarks.com\r\n\r\nI
  am very happy to give lectures, or share information with anyone who wants to learn
  more about what was the largest global branding in the world\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\nAdrian
