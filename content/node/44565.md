body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThis is an odd one. I'm struggling on a suitable typeface to
  use on a jazz website (all types of jazz, not just a specific genre (dammit! I was
  looking for an excuse to use Device fonts Blackcurrant; and a 60s style jazz site
  would've been perfect) but everything from Eartha Kittt to <cough> Jamie Cullum.\r\n\r\nApparently
  it has to be \"classy\". Now classy I can do. Jazz I can do. Together? <sigh>\r\n\r\nAny
  quick suggestions - freeform or otherwise ;) - greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nsimon\r\n\r\n"

    was the first suggestion out of the gate there, too.)

    a cultural connection and have a relatively neutral design that can be applied
    to all kinds of jazzy stuff."

  body: Can't go wrong with a Reid Miles tribute. A big fat Clarendon with Akzidenz
    Grotesk, or AG Bold Condensed with a lighter Clarendon, etc etc. That's already
    been said, I'm just chippin' in.

  body: I should also mention that photography is important for that "look," but I
    don't know if your project is strictly type based or what.

  body: "Photography...\r\n\r\nYes, also something I'm looking into - but primarily
    my concerns were firmly in the lap of type, which I *know* is usually the wrong
    way to go about things, but that's just the way I design. :)\r\n\r\nWe have accounts
    everywhere with stock sites, but everything is so generic and bland (with the
    exception of Morguefile; somewhere that constantly surprises me, being royalty
    free, and, well, free).\r\n\r\nClarendon looks like an ideal face, and something,
    possibly due to font \"jamias-vu\" (see it often, always forget it's there) I'd
    never have thought of.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for suggestions, I'll start experimenting
    when I hit the office tomorrow.\r\n\r\nsimon"

  body: "You could use a typeface that has a \"cultural\" axis.\r\nBy that, I mean
    that instead of the usual axes such as weight, scale and slant, there are, for
    instance, historical variants.\r\nChalet, of course, represents several scenes.\r\nHypatia
    has options too, with old-style and geometric as variants on the same body.\r\nOf
    my faces, <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/eunoia.html\">Eunoia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/panoptica.html\">Panoptica</a>
    provide alternate vibes within the same general brand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
