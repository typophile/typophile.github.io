body: Hi folks! Just discovered this site and its forums. <BR> <BR>We have been using
  the font &#34;Foundry Sans&#34; for a particular client. We&#39;d like to have this
  client purchase the font, but I&#39;ve been unable to find a place to buy it! <BR>Any
  suggestions? Thanks.

    &#41; <BR> <BR><i>But, you stated that youve been using &#39;Foundry Sans&#39;
    for that client, so how did you get to use the font, if you havent purchased a
    licensed copy, yet.?</i>

  body: Thanks, Dav. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t worked here long enough to know where
    we purchased &#34;Foundry Sans.&#34; I do know that we have purchased all the
    fonts we own. Is this a font that typically comes packaged or bundled?
