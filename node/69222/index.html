  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've made a couple of quick videos to show the difference in editing between Fontographer and FontLab. FontLab has so much more power than Fontographer, so I'm not complaining overall. But I AM frustrated by some of the actual drawing/editing behaviors.

[[http://www.typesetit.com/video/fog-demo.mov|In this first video]], I show how I use Fontographer to connect two letters to make a ligature. In this case, I used the "r" to the letter "k."

 I began by removing the overlap of two paths, then using the merge tool to get rid of unwanted nodes. With Fontographer, the interpretation of that merge is so much more intuitive with regard to what I want it to do. The amount of editing is limited.

[[http://www.typesetit.com/video/fl-demo.mov|In this second video,]], I perform the identical task of making the same ligature. But what happens in FontLab with regard to the merge (in FontLab, the delete button does the same task as Merge in Fontographer) is a bit frustrating. Its interpretation of what I want it to do is different and requires more editing on my part. 

With this simple task demonstrated in the two videos, I'm able to perform more than three times faster in Fontographer than in FontLab.

QUESTION: Is it that I am just very accustomed to how Fontographer works, or is there something I could do differently in FONTLAB that would make this process easier (and, more like how Fontographer performs)? 

Or is my interpretation that Fontographer is more intuitive a correct one?

P.S. I hope the videos explain what I mean... I didn't want to have to try explaining by typing all of the steps out.  :)</div>

Perhaps you find Fontographer's tools more inutitive because you've been using them for so long. I find FOG's scaling and rotation tools utterly incomprehensible but, then again, I've been using CorelDraw since 1990, so maybe it's just me...</div>

Yes, there is a lot to be said for familiarity. You're right about the rotation and scaling in Fontographer (FOG).  However, I find that the way Fontographer works with Bezier paths and nodes is IMHO superior to Ilustrator (and FontLab) and worth the trade off.

There are features in both FOG and FL that I really like. I would love to be able to combine features I like about FontLab with features I don't in Fontographer (or vise versa).

It really doesn’t take much to be superior to the way Illustrator handles paths, nodes, and handles. </div>

I have to laugh at that... you're right. I never used Freehand way back when, but I wonder if it handled similarly to Fontographer since both programs were originally created by ALTSYS.</div>

The funny thing, it's true, it was not a font at the time, but I got over a dozen emails in about 2 days time asking for the font. So, I created a whole font around it (based on the few of letters in the word LOVE).

		<div class="commentbody">I guess I messed up... I edited my original remarks and added the video stuff.... now some of these threads won't make sense to new viewers.  My apologies.


BELOW is the original POST of this thread:

Adam Twardock mentioned in another thread:

<em>I've checked and Fontographer 5.0 (soon to be released) behaves the same way as the Type 1 spec and the same way as FontLab Studio.</em>

Cool. I know and understand that FontLab is far more popular and powerful a tool than Fontographer, but I'm looking forward to the release and intend to get it. 

I've been using FontLab exclusively since I got it about 7 weeks ago. And while I've learned a great deal, and recognize the overall superiority, there are things about how FontLab functions that simply put, are inferior to Fontographer from my point of view. It's probably more a matter of my being used to Fontographer, as I have used it since 1988. 

In fact, over the years I often found myself using Fontographer to do work that most people would do in Adobe Illustrator. I simply liked Fontographer's drawing methods better than Illustrator. It seems to be so much more intuitive.



There are definitely things I like about FontLab over Fontographer, but my hope is that Fontographer's upgrade will incorporate some of those features FontLab has with the already good features of Fontographer.

AFAIK if you do this FL tries to match the curve, so will keep it smooth. (Might be a prefs issue too.)
Edit: Alternately using the eraser ("2" key) to remove those nodes keeps curves smooth for me.</div>

<em>...you might want to try deleting the excessive nodes one by one (click on every one and hit delete)</em>
To be honest, that seems like more work than how I did it in the video. 

I wonder if there is a "MERGE" function in FontLab that works slightly differently than using "DELETE"? Or is how it behaves something that I can set up differently in Preferences?

I don't know the answer, so I'll post this message, then investigate it.

I did try the selection of the node instead of a lasso over the node, and YES, the behavior IS different (and how I prefer it to behave). 

I'll have to play a bit more with it, to see how it works when I have many nodes to delete.... if it's time consuming, or easier.

This is my main bug: there was a way in FOG to select any points and cmmd-m would remove them, (merge).

		<div class="commentbody">Removing nodes in FLS is a lot better than it used to be in previous versions of FL, in which removing even a single node would often result in major outline distortions. In FLS there are still plenty of annoyances, though:

Removing nodes individually usually works differently (and better) than removing a bunch of nodes all at once. This means one needs to carefully select and delete nodes in sequence, trying to guess from experience what order will result in the least distortion and extra editing.

Removing a start point results in a straight line, even if the start point had a curve on both sides. This means one needs to redefine the start point to somewhere else on the outline before removing nodes.</div>

As someone pointed out above, this problem can be avoided by using the Erase Tool instead of the delete key. You can also left-right-click the node, which retains the curve even if it is a start node.</div>
