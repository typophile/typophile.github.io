  together (i.e. the sans, the serif & the slab), but I am frustrated by inability
  to identify 'em due to a misplaced Rockledge and, perhaps, a lack of zeal due to
  a current bout of brochonitis.  Would y'all be so kind and help out this uffering
  b-tard?  Thanx, Geo.\r\n\r\nThe serif looks look a Bodoni, but I don't believe it
  is.\r\nThe slab looks loike a variation on Egyptianne but it isn't.\r\nAnd, the
  cap \" R \" in the sans is really throwing my weezing and conjested brain for a
  loop.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_3906.samples.jpg]"

  body: "Is a fourth face used for $29.50, $125.00 and (2 oz.)?\r\n\r\nAt first I
    thought the 2's were Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk, but the 5's don't seem right.
    They don't appear to be Stymie's numerals either. What are they?!"
