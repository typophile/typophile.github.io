body: "I've fought through the \"Shaping the Page\" chapter in Bringhurst, and --
  much though I admire the precise reckoning that it represents -- at the end of the
  chapter, I'm left with frustration as I work on the particular sorts of page that
  I typically lay out.\r\n\r\nAs a teacher, I produce very many documents, which I
  often prefer to distribute on two columns on a landscape orientation. I find that
  readers respect a well-laid-out page that looks as if it were photocopied from a
  book more than they do a page that's printed out in a typical one-column portrait
  layout. Default two-column settings in Word or Pages, though, involve various minor
  vexations that sum up to the conclusion that there must be a better way. I have
  InDesign 2.0 (Mac), but my forays into InDe pages have not been reliably successful.\r\n\r\nThe
  attractive alternative would, of course, involve setting one-up pages of ideal dimensions,
  then printing them two-up; but Apple's print engine does odd things with margins
  when printing two-up, and I'm not clever enough to out-think the print engine.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a source of wisdom, whether here on the boards or in a tutorial somewhere,
  for producing two-up landscape pages that allow consecutive page numbering on facing
  pages (don't think a word processor will do that one) with moderately clear, reproducible
  dimensions for the text box, the page number, running heads (if needed), harmonious
  margins, and so on? In other words, that simulate a book page layout printing on
  an 8.5x11 letter page?"

    facing pages that are each half-page in size and choosing 'print spreads', or
    just setting up  a single landscape page with two text boxes. Master pages should
    allow you to do this pretty easily. Apple's print engine should not affect your
    layout, as long as you aren't telling it to 'Fit to Page' or to scale.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    I'm not understanding your question? I started using InD with InD CS1 (and have
    used each version since), so I'm not familiar with InD 2.0's particular settings."

    with it. I just haven't passed the shoulder of the learning curve yet.\r\n\r\nAssuming,
    for the meantime, that I girded my loins and tackled InD again, do the denizens
    of these forums have any particular wisdom about size and placement of text box
    relative to page size (half letter) and type size?"

  body: "Refer back to Bringhurst and look at the Average Character Count Per Line
    table. This will give you a good idea of what line length you want. Pick the type
    size according to your taste and/or audience: designers love tiny type and the
    typical older reader likes big type.\r\n\r\nIn design and type, there are typically
    no 'right' answers, only appropriate ones."

  body: "For your ID problems, get Adobe Classroom in a Book for ID. It will get you
    over the basics. I needed it, and I had many years of PageMaker experience.\r\n\r\nAs
    for your design, best solution for looking at design problems is to compare your
    output with actual books, and compare dimensions. For one thing, if you have been
    working with Word, you probably are using too large a point size for the work
    to really look like a book. Few books use 12 point text.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Don. I have a guide (not the Adobe one, but an alternative that I
    picked up back when ID 2 was standard), and I will consult it. And I don't have
    a problem with type size -- the heart of the matter is the text frame. Since I
    posted this, I've been hand-sketching and measuring text frames, and (removed
    from the context of an actual book) they all wind up looking weird to me. \r\n\r\nI'll
    just forge ahead, though, and eventually will produce something I can live with."
