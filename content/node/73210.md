  body: "I am a big fan of the work of Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse, especially <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/nofret-bq/\">Nofret</a>,
    an elegant, calligraphic-influenced serif, which was one of the first fonts I
    used extensively for myself. I think it has beautiful lines and it is rarely seen,
    so it has a distinctive feel that comes from not being over-familiar. I also like
    her <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alcuin-lt/\">Alcuin</a> a
    lot. It's another strongly calligraphic, lovely, design.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
