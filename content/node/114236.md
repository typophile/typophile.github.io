  body: Pump isn't exactly right, but I think it is stylistically close enough for
    my purposes. Thanks donshottype!

  body: "You're welcome Greg. Bear in mind that for several decades before digital
    fonts, signs were not made direct from fonts. They were either done by hand or
    by photographic means that allowed morphing of weight, relative width and relative
    height of letters.\r\nDon"

  body: "To add to what Don said, pre-digital typefaces also often came with many
    alternate forms for specific characters - such as the slanted crossbar on the
    lowercase /e, or perhaps a rounded as well as an angled /w. This habit was particularly
    flavour-of-the-month during the '70s. Sadly, most early digitizations of these
    fonts did not carry over the alternates, presumably as postscript type 1 and ttf
    file formats of the time did not have the needed glyph positions or means of accessing
    them. So don't assume that a digital font is not the droid you're looking for
    simply because one or two glyph shapes differ slightly.\r\n\r\nNow, with unicode,
    otf and the rich features within, this is beginning to change. I do hope that
    many of these funky fonts are revisited and that lost alternates start coming
    to light once again."
