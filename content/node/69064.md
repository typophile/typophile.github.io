  the OPTI typefaces? I just used one in a project and wanted to provide my client
  a way to purchase their own copy, but it looks like Castcraft is no longer around.
  Is someone else handling the OPTI fonts, or are they orphans now?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nMeredith"

  body: "Castcraft, aka Type Founders of Chicago, moved decades ago from Hubbard St
    in Chicago to a close-in suburb (Skokie? Niles?) and was still operating within
    the past few years when I happened to drive by. I failed to find any current incarnation,
    but they used several names even years ago as a prominent pirate. Besides pirated
    fonts (Typositor to later, generally poor digital), they were a big metal vendor
    (I have a partial metal set of Helvetica gifted as they left downtown in the \u201970s),
    and also had a guy (whose name escapes me) who did fabulous high-end signage,
    from sand-blasted glass to the created-on-building inscribed metal logo for a
    well-known Michigan Ave mall. Longtime owner Manny Kreiter died in 2005, but whether
    Boomie or any of the others who may still be around kept it going is unknown.\r\n\r\nAside
    from simply having ANY version of their many offerings, most would consider their
    collection worthless. Anyone who has a digital \"OPTIfont\" and a font editor
    can readily view the problems, including usually several times too many Bezier
    points within any character. I counted 78 control points on a minimal character,
    for instance, that should have had less than a dozen."

    Seems I have the entire Opti-Fonts library.\r\n\r\nSay what you will about the
    quality of their renderings, at least they included the entire character set.
    The currently available cut lacks punctuation. Huh?\r\n\r\nThat said; I was fortunate
    in passing through Chicago 10 years ago (my how time flies) to phone Boomie, and
    to take a walk through the building. Having bought foundry type from them in the
    past, I was keen to see.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/interrobang918/sets/72157594426247688/\r\n\r\nWhat
    I regret having missed photographing was the wall of pigeon-holes filled with
    typositor film spools. If my memory serves, it had to have been 50 x 50 grid with
    3' x 3\" cubbies, each with a different face. Boomie's nephew... Tracy? laughed
    and asked if I wanted to buy them. Thanks, but no.\r\n\r\nIn a back room was where
    he worked using machines to cut plexiglass signage. \r\n\r\nAn undistinguished
    end to the work of some at least resourceful, if ahem, unethical, entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nmichael
