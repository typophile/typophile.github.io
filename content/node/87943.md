  like how Hoefler & Frere-Jones really explain the features of their fonts clearly.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[[http://bit.ly/t0qfdN|Here
  is a link to an example features page if you aren't familiar.]]\r\nThe features
  of a font are going to be important in the final decision because the content is
  very dense and has lots of different situations that are proving to be difficulties
  with their current fonts. However, I'm not finding any other font houses that really
  go through it at that detail for the customer, and would like to be able to have
  more choices than only what Hoefler offers. Are there any other font house suggestions
  or websites where I can get the information to make informed decisions about a font
  before I purchase it or worse, present another challenging font to the client?"

    I believe.\r\n\r\nMost independent font designers (like myself, e.g.) or small
    studios simply haven\u2019t the capacity to set up programming of a more sophisticated
    font shop infrastructure.\r\nWe usually try to compensate this shortcoming by
    close customer relations.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would welcome a progress in this.
    Maybe MyFonts will still getting better by time, it is still one of the very few
    (the only?) free selling platform accessible to everyone. There you have a huge
    selection \u2013 with the more exclusive shops you have more comfort but a narrow
    choice."

    my font Williams Caslon Text does. Also you can call them or e-mail them and their
    sales staff will be happy to help you. I think that generally speaking the smaller
    shops are approachable and happy to work with customers. '

    down to see it and the meaning of the icons is kind of confusing and you can not
    click to see what they mean. They never should have let Nick go."

    on the site that can be referenced for those icons?

    always suggest what usage they might be appropriate for, so you may have to come
    up with that kind of rationale yourself. Here is a some generic BS that may be
    helpful:\r\n<em>Its letter shapes are the result of a design process that brings
    together fluidity, clarity and rhythm.</em>\r\n\r\nAlso, search the Typophile
    Release section.\r\n\r\nIf you can, get hold of printed specimen booklets: email
    the foundries and ask.\r\nOr attend TypeCon and AtypI conference and get the goody
    bag!\r\n\r\n"
