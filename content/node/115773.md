    a little thicker outline stroke, or it's just artificially condensed by a very
    small percent, otherwise it looks like  Helvetica Neue Bold."

  body: "Seems like it has been scr*** up anyway. The position of the \u2018o\u2019
    is way too high. As if someone decided that it sit at the baseline but forgot
    to look what happened at the x-height level. Also the \u2018a\u2019 looks as if
    it is a bit sick in the stomach."
