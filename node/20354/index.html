  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Aghhh! I just got a job interview while I was in the process of getting my resume and cover page together, but I am cursed and my computer crashed, and I couldn&rsquo;t get it up until the last day so please help me. This is my first cover letter and I want to do a good job, even though I don&rsquo;t have much time.</p>
<p>The company I&rsquo;m applying for designs things for industrial and technology companies. Although it&rsquo;s not exactly glamorous, I need a job, so it will have to do. According to their website, the advantage they have over other companies is that they understand the challenges faced by tech companies because they&rsquo;ve been doing business to business advertising for almost 20 years.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet designed the cover page or resume but I&rsquo;m working on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the font yet, but I&rsquo;m thinking Legato would do well. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>The cover letter, please rip it apart:</p>
<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>My name is Anthony Iverson, and I am a graphic and web designer. I first heard about your company from Janet, a relative of mine, and I was immediately interested in having the opportunity to meet you.</p>
<p>The other day I was looking at your website when I realized your company values reminded me of those of a designer named Otl Aicher, on whom I did a project last year. In this project I had to research his life and work and then write an article about him. I came to the conclusion that there was one important quality that separated him from most other designers of his time. It was his longing to create lasting brand value in the companies he worked for through efficient, pleasing, and logical design.</p>
<p>I also see those qualities in your work and writing, and I feel it&rsquo;s something we have in common. It&rsquo;s something I strongly believe in, that all my work be designed for the benefit of the reader, and to strengthen the client&rsquo;s brand, according to their own needs and goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very grateful for your time, and I hope to be considered as an addition to your team. I know we can do great things together. Thank you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
Anthony Iverson</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello Anthony,</p>
<p>have you already spoken (on phone) with the gentleman you are addressing (Peter)? If not, I would still keep it formal with &ldquo;Mr. Lastname&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Is your relative, Janet, in good-standing and respected in the company (no offense, since your credibility is first judged by what credibility the company has in her).</p>
<p>Are these people even going to know about Herr Aicher? How he busted the balls of Dr. Braun during the rebranding? If they do know about Aicher, they may not agree with his philosophies and &ldquo;bedside manner&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just combing over what might be viewed as &ldquo;negatives&rdquo;.
Your closing &ldquo;I know we can do great things together.&rdquo; sounds a little too intimate and you might be better off dropping it.</p>
<p>Just my humble opinion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Norbert on all points - keep it formal, drop the &ldquo;great things together&rdquo; (it sounds like you are considering them as a peer or equal partner, and not your boss, which they may not take kindly to). I would also eliminate the bit about Otl Aicher, this is a bit too esoteric. I would state your strenghts, your experience, and why you would like to work for them. Keep it brief, and to the point.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Update for anyone who&rsquo;s interested:</p>
<p>I stayed up until 4 am working on my resume design last night, and made some adjustments to the cover letter and had them all ready to be printed out in the morning. It turns out I copied the wrong files to be printed and I had an older, quite awful version of my resume using Times New Roman, with a poor layout on two pages. I was so heart broken. And if I went back home to get the right files I would be late for the interview. Fortunately he didn&rsquo;t ask for the resume during the interview, so I never handed him the crappy version. He checked out my work and we talked for a while and it was overall a good interview, but I think he was doubting my experience a little bit. So I didn&rsquo;t quite get the job, but he said he was thinking maybe I could do some freelance work for him this summer, just to test the water. So it&rsquo;s better than nothing.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help and honest opinions. And don&rsquo;t think it was all for nothing, you&rsquo;ve helped me see what I can do better, and I&rsquo;ll put it to use in my next cover letter.  :-)</p>
