    in London!'

  body: the House33 shop is actualy kind of a clothes shop, with about 10 t-shirts
    all in Medium, a couple of pairs of jeans and a few hoodies and coats.  <BR> <BR>It
    was also very expensive.  <BR> <BR>A big disapointment! <BR> <BR>JIM <BR>===

  body: 'Jim, <BR> <BR>Thank you for your kind and encouraging words. Funny how you
    smile and shake my hand in person then insult me and my company when sitting alone
    behind a keyboard and the comfortable warm glow of a computer monitor. <BR> <BR>To
    clarify a few things:  <BR> <BR>1. The shop stocks shirts in S to XXL...we just
    keep mediums on display because it looks better when they all hang at the same
    length. All you had to do is ask. <BR> <BR>2. There are six different styles of
    jeans, available in 30 through 38 waist. There is no inseam selection, but we&#39;ll
    nip around the corner and have them hemmed. <BR> <BR>3. There are also sweats
    as well as men&#39;s and women&#39;s dress shirts in five different colors and
    two different styles. I guess you didn&#39;t notice the custom Lewis Leathers
    Jackets or the George Cox Brothel Creepers in four different colors. We also brought
    the last two of the limited edition walnut Neutra chairs, which are on the shop
    floor. <BR> <BR>4. Pricing: Yep, it&#39;s expensive. The fabric for the t-shirts
    and sweats is custom dyed and then the garments are custom sewn to our specifications.
    Likewise for the jeans. Both of those are made in limited runs in Portugal, not
    in a far east sweat shop. The dress shirts, shoes, and Lewis Leathers are all
    made in England. Combine that with Soho rent, VAT, custom-printed wallpaper, custom
    cut stainless steel signs and then tell me how expensive our store is. By the
    way, we sell the fonts in the store for the direct conversion from dollars to
    pounds. <BR> <BR>Anyway, thanks for stopping by. <BR> <BR>Rich <BR>'

  body: Hi Rich <BR> <BR>Firstly it isn&#39;t an insult, I love what you guys do and
    this is only an opinion. <BR> <BR>When I poped in on the Friday, the store wasn&#39;t
    open and I couldn&#39;t look around. When I returned on the Saturday you were
    busy. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I&#39;d suggest that any typophile on here check it out
    for themselves. The clothes were really good quality and if I had known that they
    were in my size I would have bought a few T&#39;s &#40;the English are to shy
    to ask..hehehe..&#41; <BR> <BR>My disapointment was really not because of what
    is is. As a clothes store it sells nice stuff &#40;and in more sizes then I realised&#41;
    and the deco is fantastic. But as a typophile who got a House Industries email
    about the new shop, I guess I was expecting something different, more type based
    &#40;like disneyland for typophiles&#41;... <BR> <BR>So, my disapointment really
    came from what I thought it might be, rather then what it was... like I say, if
    your in London, check it out and post your thoughts, if your visiting London,
    check it out... <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>=== <BR>
