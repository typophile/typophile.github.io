<div class=commentbody>In response to the original question regarding which cut of Akzidenz Grotesk is the best. <br> <br>Linotype originally only released four weights in normal width (in a cross license agreement with Berthold per Erik Spiekermann's old post). They are no longer available. <br> <br>The original Berthold versions have normal, condensed, and extended widths. The choice is obvious. <br> <br>Joseph Pemberton's comment regarding avoiding Berthold because he does not agree with how a company protects its intellectual property (most of the posts simply do not understand trademark law and why it is essential to protect a trademark) is irrelevant for judging typeface quality. <br> <br>Nigel Hamilton</div>

<div class=commentbody>Of course people can express their own views but what is "unethical" or "bad behavior" about protecting valuable intellectual property? <br> <br>Hrant, your comment about "prior art for Delta" is irrelevant regarding trademarks. That is why you have Delta Airlines, Delta faucets, Delta typeface etc. All different classes of goods. <br> <br>Joe's comment about "nobody believes Berthold will suffer a loss in the marketplace" is not the point. If a company lets one person do it, then another will follow and so on until it falls into the public domain. <br> <br>Escalator, Band-Aid, Asprin, Shredded-Wheat, and Kerosene" were once trademarks. Those trademarks became generic because the corporations that originally owned them did not properly use them, and they allowed anyone to use them improperly. <br> <br> <br>Nigel Hamilton</div>

<div class=commentbody>You two lost me back there... <br> <br>But Nigel, you're totally right when it comes to purchasing Akzidenz Grotesk the clear choice is the Berthold version. (And Akzidenz Grotesk is a great face, without question.) <br> <br>The folks who bought the Berthold library made an excellent business decision. I just think their practices since then don't make great business sense. Maybe they're protecting their font names, but they're dragging the Berthold name through the mud with their hyper-litigiousness. <br> <br>I haven't heard of Windows verses Lindows, but I did laugh about the Microsoft verses Mike Rowe (who holds <a href=http://www.mikerowesoft.com/ target=_blank>MikeRoweSoft.com</a>). Does MS really think that MikeRowe and his site are going to cause confusion? (Or is it that over time a bunch of Mike Rowe's could take MS' name into the public domain.)

<div class=commentbody>>it is essential to protecting intellectual property <br> <br>Leaving aside Hrant's raving, my impression that many on these boards do not understand the legal situation with intellectual property rights, which are important to the type business. <br> <br>As Nigel says, my understanding is that the owner of a trademark is required to sue or risk losing ownership of the trademark. This is perhaps a bad law, but that is the box that it puts the trademark owner in. If all that Berthold is doing is protecting its trademarks, I do not think they can be faulted for that, and people should not boycott them for that reason. <br> <br>In the US, my understanding is that only the name can be trademarked, and that in general design itself is not protected. The laws do seem to need changing, but Berthold should not be blamed for the box that the law puts them in. <br> <br>I am not a lawyer, and I do not know about Berthold's business practices generally, but there needs to be some understanding of the problem any digital foundry faces. <br> <br>Perhaps other owners of digital foundries can comment. <br></div>

If you look at <a href=http://www.linotype.com target=_blank>www.linotype.com</a> you will be able to read the following sentence: "Basic Commercial font is based on the design for Akzidenz Grotesk, which appeared with Berthold in 1900, designed by type setters whose names have not been recorded, but whose skill cannot be overlooked. This typeface has been popular among groups and movements so diverse as the Bauhaus, Dadaism, and the masters of Swiss typography. It served as an influence for a variety of newer, more anonymous grotesque fonts as well as Helvetica. Basic Commerical font is a clear and objective font whose forms exhibit almost nothing unusual, but which remains both lively and legible". <br>Basic Commercial is available in OpenType with the better hinting, But also in PS and TT for non-InDesign users.<center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>BasicCommercialBold<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/14056BasicCommBold-32980.pdf target=_blank><b>14056BasicCommBold.pdf</b></a> (16.0 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody>Nigel, <br> <br>There is a lot more to the Berthold story than has been discussed here. In my opinion, none of the big stories have been brought up so far. I wish I could talk about it, but even this message is probably more than I ought to say. <br> <br>I can note that Berthold fonts were formerly available from Adobe, Agfa Monotype and Linotype, and that all of these companies are no longer resellers of Berthold designs. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>jumping in late here with a few points <br> <br>Prior Art, while mostly cited in patent and copyright cases, <br>can also apply to trademarks. <br> <br>You can file a trademark as <br> <br>a) the word <br>b) the design alone <br>c) word + design <br> <br>the patent examiner will check active trademarks <br>for possible conflicts, thus checking for Prior Art. <br> <br>In the Berthold/Delta situation specifically, Prior Art, taken literally, is <br>indeed irrelevant but Prior Use is not. <br> <br>William wrote "my understanding is that the owner of a trademark <br>is required to sue or risk losing ownership of the trademark." <br> <br>Not quite right. It will help you if you can <br>show a track record of protecting your mark. <br>But there is not requirement to sue. <br>It's not about that. <br>But if you have a trademark that is in jeopardy, <br>nowadays, you probably are spending your money elsewhere. <br>On advertising. <br>That's how you keep from 'losing' a mark from <br>it becoming genericized. <br> <br> <br>Take Xerox, Wite-Out, Band-Aid, Velcro and some <br>others. The owners of these marks take out ads every month in various magazines <br>(usually Writer-oriented publications) that spell <br>out proper usage of their marks in print. <br> <br>Kleenex (TM) brand disposable tissues, etc. <br> <br>the older brands did not do that ... if I'm not mistaken. <br>So these brands today can point to a pile of money <br>spent educating others on proper usage <br>if the generic nature of their mark becomes an issue. <br> <br>As far as Berthold, it's interesting to look specifically at the Delta mark's history. <br> <br> <br> <br>2004-02-17 - Registered - Principal Register <br> <br>2003-11-25 - Published for opposition <br> <br>2003-11-05 - Notice of publication <br> <br>2003-09-22 - Approved for Pub - Principal Register (Initial exam) <br> <br>2003-08-07 - Communication received from applicant <br> <br>2003-08-27 - Case File in TICRS <br> <br>2003-08-07 - PAPER RECEIVED <br> <br>2003-04-11 - Letter of suspension mailed <br> <br>2003-03-27 - PAPER RECEIVED <br> <br>2003-02-03 - Letter of suspension mailed <br> <br>2002-11-14 - Communication received from applicant <br> <br>2002-11-14 - PAPER RECEIVED <br> <br>2002-11-05 - Case file assigned to examining attorney <br> <br>2002-06-21 - Case file assigned to examining attorney <br> <br>2001-04-18 - Letter of suspension mailed <br> <br>2001-02-09 - Communication received from applicant <br> <br>2000-08-18 - Non-final action mailed <br> <br>2000-07-18 - Case file assigned to examining attorney <br> <br>I don't know if this TM just got forgotten when a <br>sale of the business was happening?

<div class=commentbody>certainly. but with respect to commencing <br>trademark litigation it does. <br> <br>You can send out letters and threaten but <br>you can't file a suit until you have a <br>registered mark in hand. That's my understanding. <br> <br>Which means nothing here anyway as long as Berthold <br>isn't missrepresenting its marks.... big company vs. an <br>individual, some threatening letters, <br>ends things pretty quickly without litigation. <br> <br>but if Berthold had wanted to sue Jamie, it would have had to wait until <br>'Delta' became registered <br>or sue for infringement on the 'Delta Jaeger' <br>mark only, not the 'Delta' mark. <br> <br>blah, blah, of course this is boring. <br>More interesting ... luc's summary, below. <br> <br> <br><a href=http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/hunt-nazaroff.html target=_blank>http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/hunt-nazaroff.html</a> <br><a href=http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html target=_blank>http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html</a> <br><a href=http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90069.html target=_blank>http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90069.html</a> <br> <br>Nigel, do you have some association with Berthold? <br> <br>And how would you assess the way Berthold is being run, if you know or care to share ... <br> <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>BJ <br>>but if Berthold had wanted to sue Jamie, it would have had to wait until 'Delta' became registered <br> <br>You are wrong on this. You can sue without a trademark being registered. <br> <br>>More interesting ... luc's summary, below <br> <br>Luc's article is full of incorrect statements and conclusions it belongs in the Star or National Enquirer. <br> <br>He also references comments by Fred Nader which speaks for itself. <br> <br>As far as how I feel that Berthold is being run I think that the type industry is going back to the days when foundries exclusively distribute their own product. <br> <br>For example only Linotype markets Linotype Univers, Optima Nova, Linotype Syntax etc. <br> <br>You don't see any of Agfa Monotype's new product (including ITC) in the Adobe Library or through Linotype. <br> <br>In fact in a recent Adobe's SEC filing there is a lawsuit between Agfa Monotype and Adobe which Adobe claims would have an adverse effect if they lost. <br> <br>Berthold controls its product although it apears that Agfa Monotype distributes Berthold rather than licensing it as they did in the past. <br> <br>I think Agfa Monotype, Berthold, and Linotype are doing things the right way. Controlling their product. <br> <br>And the only reason that I entered this thread is that I keep seeing so much misinformation about trademarks that no wonder the independent type designer gets into trouble if he doesn't know right from wrong.

<div class=commentbody>BJ <br> <br>Yes you can file suit without a trademark being registered however the burden of proof is on the person suing. <br> <br>If a trademark is registered then there is the presumption that the trademark is valid and the burden shifts to the defendant.

<div class=commentbody>Nigel <br> <br>On the Luc site, a lot of Berthold's actions seem to be silly and pointless. <br> <br>The issue with Baremo and FF Sari, though, seems to me quite reasonable. Sari is in fact a 'new Baremo'and 'New Barem' would be exploiting the reputation of the old which is still evidently owned by Berthold - so it would cut into their mark. <br> <br>In fairness, you should answer the question about whether you are associated with Berthold. <br> <br>I agree that people are way too ready to attack anyone trying to protect their IP rights. But Berthold does look silly in some of the warning letters. Do you think I wrong about this? </div>

<div class=commentbody>It would be handy if one could rely on stuff on Luc's site, but I don't feel I can trust even the stuff that seems plausible. In some areas that I do know plenty about, like OpenType, his writing has a lot of material that is simply false, as well as a lot that is misleading or devoid of content (but always full of inflammatory rhetoric). We're talking a major axe to grind. <br> <br>Of course, if you believe that all corporations are evil, and that there are conspiracies everywhere, then you'll probably find Luc's world view quite complementary to your own. <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>> the burden of proof is on the person suing. <br> <br>That's generally inconsequential, because the bureaucratic weight -that's fostered by the system- causes the case to be resolved in favor of the bastard way before any actual judge* gets involved. <br> <br>* And where does the judge's paycheck come from, I wonder? <br> <br>Thomas, don't bundle valid complaints about wanton capitalism with conspiracy theorists and provincial concepts like "Evil".

So just because the design is different you still need to avoid names that already exist. <br> <br>If Jamie had named the typeface (Omicron Delta) Omicron Univers, Omicron Rockwell he probably would have run into the same trouble. So if you "googled" delta/univers/rockwell and Omicron delta/univers/rockwell appeared prominently in the search results there is a potential problem. <br> <br>Do you think the following names infringe? <br>Rocktus as opposed to Rockwell <br>Bemtus as opposed to Bembo <br> <br>If your answer was no then you were wrong.

<div class=commentbody>>I think Agfa Monotype, Berthold, and Linotype are doing things the right way. Controlling their product&lt; <br> <br>I've kept quiet for a long time, but now i have to clear up a few facts. <br> <br>1. Berthold Types in chicago is not the legal successor to H. Berthold AG <br> <br>2. Berthold Types has registered most of H. Berthold's trademarks and thus has every right to defend them <br> <br>3. Berthold Types has no contracts with any of the original designers whose fonts are being sold today; thus effectively stealing from designers like Hans Reichel, who designed Barmeno but doesn't receive license payments for his design. Nor was he allowed to re-issue his own face as New Barmeno. So he had to call it Sari and redraw it extensively, just to be able to publish a typeface he licensed to H. Berthold AG, not Berthold Types (see 1). <br> <br>4. Berthold Types sues everybody who only gets into the vicinity of one of their trademarks or even imagined marks, for example "super" or even "grotesk". In these cases they just lost, finally. It is absurd to want to claim a trademark for a generic term like Grotesk, just because it occurs in one of their trademarks (Akzidenz Grotesk). Defending this not only cost countless hours but also tens of thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees. <br> <br>5. They have been sueing dozens of people with frivolous cases. Failing to answer brings about a judgement in their favour; answering cost more money than all these small designers and foundries have. They win not by being right, but by default. <br> <br>6. They are bullies; it is not about trademarks but about deleting the competition. <br> <br>7. I could cite many more (and worse) cases which have cost me and other designers and foundries millions of dollars (and i am not exaggerating), but this will probably already make me the target of the next attack. <br> <br>8. This list doesn't discuss legal matters for their own sake. This list is not called legaphile; it is run by and for people who care for and live by typography.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I guess I will never purchase another font from Berthold. The Naziesque law suits and poor treatment of outstanding type designers have soured the brand for me. <br> <br>ChrisL <br> <br>BTW: nice logo Iota</div>

<div class=commentbody>> It's a damn shame they have Poppl's stuff. &lt; <br> <br>You should ask Poppl's widow why she never signed a contract for her late husbands faces and subsequently doesn't get any royalties. It is one thing offering a contract, but quite another what you write in it. It certainly wasn't acceptable for her.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>If your answer was no then you were wrong. <br>>This was a real case (Monotype vs URW) and Monotype won. <br> <br>That's because the designs were knocked off too, so not only were the designs the same, they had sound-alike names too - which is all the ingedients you could possibly need for an infringement. <br> <br>If the designs had been completely different then the outcome may have been different too. <br> <br>You're also wrong that designs cannot be protected. Design can be protect in the US under design patent and throughout the EU and other countries by copyright and/or other forms of IP protection. <br> <br>Apart from that I agree with most of what you write. <br> <br>-- not a Berthold schill.</div>
