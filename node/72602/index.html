  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, 

I am looking for someone to help me create a single line font to use with my engraving machine. I was thinking I would start with an existing handwriting font that has a fairly even thickness and modify it from there. 

The engraving machine software allows you to choose between it's own fonts which they call Vistool Fonts and have the extension .af4 or a True Type Font. I have a request into the company to see if there is some way for me to create a true single line font and somehow get it to into their format but I highly doubt I will get anywhere with that. So, I am thinking I will go with a true type font which I realize will not really be a single line but really 2 lines on top of each other. I think this will work okay though a true single line would be better. 

I would love to find someone to help me achieve a finished font that I can use. Please get in touch if you are interested in working together on this project. I would like to move quickly but need to have some idea of the cost of doing this. If the 1st font works well than I would like to do more. 

Thanks so much! 

-Julie

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Julie,

Actually I did such a typeface in the fall of 2009. It's a monoline family which was used for a pitch of a Biënnial. The project never got finished, so the fonts are ready (basic character set) and waiting to be used.

My original idea was to have a monoline which I then could give different strokes in Illustrator. These fonts are TTF's including A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and punctuation.

Groeten,
Dries
