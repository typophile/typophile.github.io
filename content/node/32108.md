body: "Recently (March 5) I gave a talk with the above title at the \xC9cole de design
  of the Universit\xE9 du Qu\xE9bec \xE0 Montr\xE9al in their series <em>Enjeux actuels
  en Design</em>. (The original theme for the series was \"interactive practices in
  design.\") This was at the invitation of Alessandro Colizzi, who teaches there.
  \r\n\r\nMy talks are usually tightly 'scripted,' and against a backdrop of pdf-style
  'slides.'\r\n\r\nIn case some of you are interested in reviewing or commenting on
  what I had to say, here is my text and the slides: \r\n<a href=\"http://www.enneson.com/UQAM/uqam_ge+eitvc+design_script.pdf\">text</a>\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.enneson.com/UQAM/uqam_ge+eitvc+design_slides.pdf\">slides</a>\r\n\r\nThe
  pdf of the slides will open up as a full screen set of visuals, so you'll have to
  advance slides by using the side to side arrows on your keyboard. Press: 'escape'
  on your keyboard to see it in the normal pdf environmnet."

  body: "Peter, I find the Fourier transform pictures of text intriguing, but frustrating
    as I don't know how to 'read' them properly. I know that a Fourier transform decomposes
    a function into its separate harmonic components, but I don't know how to relate
    that to the pictures of text blocks. \r\n\r\nDo you know of any tutorial on line
    which explains how to read such pictures?"

  body: "William, <a href=\"http://www.malgil.com/esl/aldus-fft/\">this site</a> and
    <a href=\"http://www.enneson.com/UQAM/duan_morris_epbxm.pdf\">this paper</a> might
    be of use. The web site is where I drew my inspiration from, after a post by Raph
    a year or so ago. The paper is in a way complementary, but makes a different point.\r\n\r\nNick,
    I'm not sure this is the presentation I'd want to give in my home town."
