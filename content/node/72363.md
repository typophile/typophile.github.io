  body: "Hi Raptor-\r\n\r\nI've had a look in all the usual places, but the impression
    I get is that it's not a commercially available font, but a proprietary type exclusive
    to Chevrolet (or whomever produces that car). A look at the Techno section of
    DaFont might yield something similar you can use.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303\r\n\r\n-NJ"
