  cyrillic. \r\nI already designed all the glyphs. Now I need to know what should
  I do before generating the font.\r\nI know is a big question, Im sorry, Im really
  lost in this step.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I'm sorry, but we can't help if you're not specific. What part are you at
    in making the font? You drew the glyphs... have you spaced them properly? Added
    ligatures? Kerned everything? What do you think is involved here that you might,
    maybe need to do?

  body: "Hi Bryan & Thanks for your interest!\r\nI have all the glyph drew without
    out the traking or Kerning.\r\n\r\nMy doubts:\r\n\u2022 Which Encoding should
    i use when i generate the font?\r\n\u2022 There is any special code/script or
    something that i should do for hebrew. I have this doubt because hebrew is written
    from LTR.\r\n\u2022 At the Font Info Window, Which supported codepages should
    I add?\r\n\r\nThanks Again\r\nAnd sorry for my bad english :)"

  body: "Encoding: Use Unicode, always!\r\n\r\nThe LTR rendering is handled by the
    renderer. Some programs don't support this, but may support reversing (mirroring)
    letters. Some people will make a second version of their font with the Hebrew
    glyphs flopped for this use. You can see some examples of this <a href=\"http://oketz.com/fonts/all.html\">here.</a>\r\n\r\nIf
    you are also doing Nikkud (which can be a little complicated) you may wish to
    add Opentype features for it, but I don't recommend it unless you're doing a font
    intended for printing Scriptures or dictionaries.\r\n\r\nBe sure to go over and
    space everything well, as in the side-bearings. This is very important in Hebrew,
    even if you don't do any kerning.\r\n\r\nOn the code pages, I don't use Fontlab,
    but I would think you would just want the normal Hebrew codepage, in Unicode U+0590\u2014U+05FF,
    and if you wish to include some presentational forms, U+FB1D\u2014U+FB4F.\r\n\r\nHave
    you posted the samples of the font on the critique forum? I would be interested
    in seeing it! :-)"

    thanks for the info.\r\n\r\nUnicode for the first encoding and for the second
    one?\r\n\r\nI still have doubts, but like i said i need to sit see and think.\r\n\r\nHere
    you can check it here :)\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/103792\r\n\r\nHope you like

  body: Unicode should be your only encoding? I'm a bit puzzled actually, perhaps
    we mean two different things by "encoding"?

    preparing to output your font, do:\r\n--> Open your source file in FontLab and
    go to File, Font Info, and click the expanding triangles from the bottom up so
    all tabs are expanded.\r\n--> Go to Encoding and Unicode and select the supported
    code pages by your font, typically Latin 1 for a Latin font (you will need to
    select more if you support more than that)\r\n--> Go to Unicode ranges and select
    the supported Unicode ranges, typically Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, and Spacing
    Modifier Letters (you will need to select more if you support more than that)\r\n\r\nThere
    is also an article here that describes how to generate a Web native font -- not
    everything will apply for you, but this should help with some of the things you
    wonder about.\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/wiki/HowToGenerateWebNativeFonts"

  body: "I wish you well with your project. Here is a very brief description as to
    how I have done something similar.\r\n\r\nI have a font family - Hebrew Font Shuneet
    - with eleven fonts.  My approach was to find a font that had Hebrew and Latin
    then to rename it and replace all the letter shapes with my own. At every stage
    I could easily verify that I had a working font. I never had to start from nothing.
    I did this with Font Creator which is a relatively low cost application. \r\n\r\nAt
    some point I decided to base the Latin characters on Tuffy.  To do this I merely
    copied all the Tuffy shapes into my own font.  I have over some years evolved
    the Latin so it no longer looks like its source but Tuffy gave me a flying start!\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n\r\n"
