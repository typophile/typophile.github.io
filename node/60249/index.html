  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>My wife finally talked me in taking her to Paris this summer.</p>
<p>Somewhere between the Louvre and Sacre Coeur we stumbled on to the <strong>[[http://www.galerieslafayette.com|Galeries Lafayette]]</strong>, a giant unbelievably luxurious french department store. I was shocked to see the place was just dripping with the font Ashby that I designed several years ago. It was used on just about every sign and banner and display in the place.</p>
<p><strong>[[http://www.woodardworks.com/type02b.html|Ashby]]</strong> is the second font I ever created. When I couldn&rsquo;t get anybody to distribute it, I let it go free. With no EULA or anything &ndash; like a big dummy.</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m the designer, I had never really seen it in use so much. It does look pretty good for the most part. But I see now it has a lot of silly errors. When I was working on it, I was obsessing on making the whole thing completely evenly weighted and I really could have used better judgement that I didn&rsquo;t possess at the time. Even the accents are the same stroke weight as the glyphs and that looks pretty funky especially when set in French.</p>
<p>The Galeries seem to be a serious business so I am surprised to see them using a free font off the web so heavily. But If they are going to use it like that, I would love to work out a pro version of Ashby for them that looks a little more professional. And maybe not quite so free.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to get hold of their art department? And somebody who hopefully speaks english??</p>
