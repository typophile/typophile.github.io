  that will focus on limited edition fashion, furniture, music,design, objects, art
  books and magazines from a specific region. The first region I'm going to focus
  on is Belgium. It will be a collection with vintage industrial pieces as well as
  \"cutting edge\" contemporary pieces.\r\n\r\nI'm calling the store Highlight which
  is the brand name that will expand to include Highlight Belgium, Highlight California,
  Highlight Japan, etc. For every country or region I would like to use a specific
  font, however I would like the word Highlight to always stay consistent.\r\n\r\nA
  few questions for you.\r\n\r\n1. Does the community have any recommendations on
  a source for regional specific fonts? \r\n2. For the word \"Highlight\" what fonts
  are versatile and can compliment the regional specific fonts for the region?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello, and welcome to Typophile! Your store sounds awesome. I wish I wasn't
    on the East coast!\r\n\r\nSome answers:\r\n\r\n1. Using region-specific fonts
    is often discouraged, as they frequently tend to add to a stereotype and thus
    look gimmicky with tasteless results. You may want to consider using one or two
    type families and, say, use colors specific to each geo-political region. If these
    Highlight areas are separate from one another, it may be a very effective and
    dramatic approach. \r\n\r\n2. Have you considered hiring a graphic designer with
    strong typographic skills rather than trying a do-it-yourself design approach?\r\n\r\nI
    realize these probably aren't the kinds of answers you're looking for, but they're
    worth consideration.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: " Thanks for the comment microspective. I'm working with a designer right
    now and he's taking his time to come up with ideas. I'm playing the role of creative
    director and he's playing the role of a draftsmen with little creative input.
    I have been tentative about playing with \"country specific\" fonts for the same
    gimmicky reasons that you mentioned.  \r\n\r\nI was thinking of using \"regional
    or \"country specific\" coloring to denote the country to the font. Similar to
    what Wallpaper* magazine did with their Brazil issue a couple months ago.They
    used their same font but colored the various letter green or yellow to denote
    the country.\r\n\r\nCreative but obvious, I'm searching more for a sort of logo/design
    that the user will not be able to grasp at first glance but have an \"ah-huh\"
    moment on second glance. For years, I never saw the arrow in the negative space
    of the FedEx symbol until someone pointed it out to me. Now the arrow is the only
    thing I look at it when I see a FedEx truck. \r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions
    and please keep them coming."

    which means that being an awsome task for some skilled type designer. Just in
    case you\u2019re going to feature Ireland some day, [[http://typophile.com/node/72348|this
    is for me]] what a localized font may look like if it is meant *not* to appear
    gimmicky. ;-)"

  body: "@Nick - great idea. A regional font doesn't need to be clover's for the letter
    O for the Ireland store or a soccer ball for the letter O for Brazil or even Spain.
    A designer from that region will do the trick to make the store authentic. \r\n\r\nThat
    being said - Can anyone recommend type designers from Belgium, Brazil, and Turkey
    (since these will be the first three countries I'm going to focus on)\r\n\r\n@Microspective
    - the store will be online as well so you can get a taste of it on the east coast
    of any country.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: I don't think the variations for the regions should be based on type, nobody
    will ever understand, even the type experts. I think you could use a creative
    approach based on other symbols that could also be treated with some level of
    sophistication and refinement but will communicate the message better.
