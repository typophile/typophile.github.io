body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nCurrently working an logo for a business networking group named:
  6 degrees.\r\n\r\nI am searching on all the font websites I know for a nice number
  6, that's a bit different yet elegant. A bit like Baskerville's ampersand below.
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ampersand_6244.jpg]\r\n\r\nHaven't really
  found anything remarkable yet, so thought I should ask the type aficiandos on here.
  I will post concepts for this logo later.\r\n\r\nIt can be serif, sans, display
  or anything.\r\n\r\nThanking you in anticipation."

  body: A sexy six? I have trouble with that all the time in my designs. The six always
    looks so dreary, especially next to the exuberant nine, at least when I do it.
    Never thought of modeling it on a Baskerville ampersand, though.

  body: "I agree, many sixes look a bit ordinary.\r\n\r\nI am not necessarily looking
    for one that's similar to the ampersand above. I used that as an example of how
    the everday ampersand can look great. You see it a lot, it's a classic \u2013
    William Berkson has it as an avatar on this forum.\r\n\r\nThe search continues\u2026"
