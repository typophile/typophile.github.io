body: "I'm brand new here and something of an ingenue at this whole typography game,
  but it's something I'm interested in and looking to learn about. To that end, I'd
  like some help from you.\r\n\r\nI need to get my hands on a nice serif \u2013 a
  fairly traditional one preferably \u2013 with 'reading' a's and g's. This is intended
  for body text in a novel-style text, so shouldn't really be so markedly different
  in any other way from what you might normally find. A lot of nice serif fonts have
  suitable italics, but the Roman or book styles have the arc overhead (although I
  don't know what that's called).\r\n\r\nThanks for your time."

    letterforms for the body text of a novel will be jarring to the reader.\r\n\r\nMoreover,
    those letter forms as alternates in serif typefaces were not adopted for reading
    purposes, but for teaching young children to *write*. All the available evidence
    is that they are in fact less legible. Plenty of publishers and designers are
    confused about this, but that doesn't make them right.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    we disagree. Now, aesthetics are hard to measure, so there are plenty of distinctions
    that are not easily made in research that still really do matter to art (or even
    craft). But anything that reading research tells us <strong>does</strong> matter,
    we should probably be paying close attention to.\r\n\r\nLigatures is an interesting
    example. Today, people using professional typesetting tools have to go out of
    their way to turn ligatures off. Yet this is commonly (though not universally)
    done in children's books. It would be very interesting to see some research on
    whether children find ligatures confusing, and at what ages or stages of learning
    to read. As far as I know there has been no research on the subject. I mentioned
    this briefly in my talk at TypeCon.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
