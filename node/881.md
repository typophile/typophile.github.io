body: When I make small posts, it seems to go through fine, but when I make larger
  ones I keep getting &#34;server error&#34; messages, even though the post goes through.  It
  just doesn&#39;t take me to the page after I make the post, I have to hit the back
  button and refresh.  This is something I&#39;ve only just noticed for the last couple
  days.
