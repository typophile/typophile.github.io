  body: "Here's the suggestion I made before:\r\n\r\nRequire the first post of a new
    user to be approved by a moderator before being visible... <em>excluding</em>
    Font ID posts.\r\n\r\nThis encourages people with a Font ID to go to the right
    forum... <em>and</em> it deals with the spam problem too, without making it impossible
    for someone with a pressing Font ID question to come here and present it right
    away."

  body: "People must be posting font id's in the General Forum <em>because that is
    where they can be found currently</em>. And those posters would not read the subsequent
    posts that say, \"no you should have posted in the Type ID forum\". (Which is
    made slightly more difficult, by the way, because the link actually says \"Font
    ID\", not \"Type ID\".)\r\n\r\nIt's the Broken Windows Theory all over. A possibly
    feasible solution (baring the terminally stupid - there are always some) is to
    riguously <em>delete</em> all font id requests here, in the forum called \"Type
    ID Forum [OLD]\" (which despite its caps and first post still appears popular),
    and in the various Critique sections.\r\n\r\n(And it should be maintained by quadibloc's
    suggestion of mild moderation of first posts.)"

  body: "They post here in the General Discussions forum because it is at the top
    of the page. You have to go to an entirely different page to get to the Font ID
    forum - With two very discrete links that took me a few moments to find just now
    as the only indication of where to go. A simple link above this forum would dramatically
    reduce font ID requests here. People are not necessarily stupid.  It's a bad user-interface
    thing. Good design helps people seem smarter and more observant. \r\n\r\n<cite>(And
    it should be maintained by quadibloc's suggestion of mild moderation of first

    period of time, that isn't going to happen. \r\n"

    it's the \"old\" forum and you must find the link in a sidebar list. Doesn't make
    sense. \r\n\r\nI'd say list the proper Font ID forum near the top of the list.\r\n"

  body: "A little background:\r\n\r\nIn order to enable custom functions for Font
    ID, we had to move it outside the main Forums, where it used to live. At the top
    of the page, under General Discussions, it reads \"All topics are welcome\u2014except
    font ID requests.\" If you try to post into General Discussions, it says at the
    top \"If you're looking for font identification, please post only in Font ID.\"\r\n\r\nThat
    said, these notices go largely ignored. While Font IDs are certainly popular,
    we're not ready to scrap the rest of the site to overemphasize newcomer posters
    who pop in and pop out without building community.\r\n\r\n@quadibloc: It's definitely
    an interesting suggestion, but we've moved away from such things years ago because
    they quickly become labor-intensive and unwieldy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's true that requiring everyone's first post to be moderated does mean
    work for someone. I was hoping that by excluding the Font ID mechanism from this,
    though, one would kill two birds with one stone:\r\n\r\n- the amount of work would
    be reduced significantly, because the majority of people posting for the first
    time are doing so for a Font ID, and\r\n\r\n- people would be encouraged to use
    the right forum for Font IDs,\r\n\r\nin addition to the <em>primary</em> objective,
    which is getting rid of spam. As I post this, there are spam posts visible on
    this forum that have not yet been deleted."

  body: Yes, I don't know if it is somehow just showing up badly on my computer, but
    the contrast on the links at the top is way too low. I did not know it was there
    until JanekZ posted that picture. It seems odd to have something like that on
    a site that's all about typography graphic design...

  body: "@JamesM, to answer your question:\r\n\r\n_ custom ID entry form\r\n_ flag
    Font IDs as solved/not solved and correct name\r\n_ identify who solved it\r\n_
    identify classification\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, this enables Typophile to build
    automated systems to managed Font IDs instead of burdening moderators, as the
    forum-based model always did.\r\n\r\nMost of all, splitting Font Identification
    out was intended to pull that sort of traffic out of the forums. That part still
    needs work, clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
