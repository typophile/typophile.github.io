  body: "Jan,\r\n\r\nVery close, thanks. The S&W type has older looking, more rounded
    off serifs. Is there an older predecessor to Clearface that might be closer? Also,
    in order to get the yellow (Clearface) to be close to the underlying (blue) original,
    I did a LOT of horizontal scaling, kerning and even baseline shifting.\r\n\r\nFor
    perspective though, S&W told me they use Garamond Bold to approximate it. It doesn't.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the input!\r\n\r\nJoshua"

    was designed by Morris Fuller Benton for American Type Founders in 1907. In 1978,
    under license from ATF, the International Typeface Corporation commissioned Vic
    Caruso to develop it into a family of four weights with corresponding italics.
    ... And then it went digital. So, transformations happened.\r\n\r\nTo answer your
    questions: Not in digital form."
