  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I´m making a book based on the short story &ldquo;library of Babel&rdquo; by Jorge Luis Borge as a school assignment. (studying graphic design.)
<a href="http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/library_of_babel.html">http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/library_of_babel.html</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel</a></p>
<p>I´m about to decide on a font.
In the story Borge describes the font used in all the books in the library:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical. &quot;</p>
<p>Just by reading this description, what would you say the font could be?</p>
<p>I´m thinking a serif, and something really classical, like Garamond, Baskerville, Caslon, or maybe Bembo?
(based on that the library has a infinite feel to it, and that the books are quite big.)</p>
<p>But would be interesting to hear what you think!
thanks!
Best
G</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In Didone style typefaces the ‘o’ has a vertical symmetry axis. In most typefaces of that style b and d as well as p and q are almost mirror imaged. The relatively thin serifs at the top of the ascenders do not really contribute to a strong asymmetrical impression. In many cases the counters of these characters, as well as those of n, m and u look quite symmetrical. Especially when compared with the Garalde style. Geometric Sans Serif may be fairly symmetrical when it comes to u, j and t (as in Futura), as well as i, v, w and x, but that’s about it. In geometric sans serif design it is of course possible to come up with a symmetrical n and m as well, but then the typeface would have looked as revolutionary as the typefaces Herbert Bayer and Joost Schmidt designed during the Bauhaus Dessau era. Herbert Bayer used it for the title of »die neue line« and both of them used such designs for the lettering in exhibition design and posters, but these rather experimental designs heave never been available as metal type back then, let alone in text sizes.</p>
<p>I’d be surprised if Borges thought of a sans serif typeface anyway. After all, his story was first published in 1941. At that time there were hardly any books printed with a sans serif as a text typeface. If he would have really imagined the books being printed in sans serif, that would have been quite a revolutionary statement for that time and I think he would thus have described that idea more precise.</p>
<p>Also we have to take into account that at that time, Garalde typefaces were a relatively young phenomenon. Most of the revivals of that style came into the market into the early 1920s. Especially in Europe were WWII will have kept many printers from buying new typesetting machines and typefaces for some time. And, like it or not, the typical 19th century book face is Didonic. Most books known to Borges in 1941 will have been set in Didonic typefaces. Many of these will have had bracketed serifs, but that alone does not make their appearance less symmetrical.</p>
<p>Didonic typefaces have a bad image when it comes to legibility, but we have to take into account that this idea is largely fed by the far too thin versions of the 20th century. This was mainly caused by poorly handled pantographs, phototype versions rendered from artwork for large sizes etc. Also the smoother paper of the 19th and 20th century had already caused many typefaces to look thinner than originally intended.</p>
<p>Today, well designed optical sizes for smaller typefaces may do a remarkably good job, especially for the Didonic style.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow, thanks! I really appreciate your input!</p>
<p>You definitely got me convinced it´s a didonic typeface I´m after. Especially:<br>
&ldquo;In most typefaces of that style b and d as well as p and q are almost mirror imaged&rdquo;</p>
<p>To me this is perfect since Borge frequently mentions mirrors in his stories, also in &ldquo;The Library of Babel&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestion for a great &ldquo;modern&rdquo; didone that would do a great job in my book? I´m going to follow the rules mentioned in Borges story, i.e: 
&ldquo;Each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color.&rdquo;
Probably set at a pretty large size, something like 12/16pt. Havn´t got that far yet&hellip;</p>
<p>Once again, thanks! I´ve learned a lot.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>FontShop’s [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/serif_bracketed_modern_text/|Modern bracketed serif]] list shows the right category, I think.</p>
<p>Thinking within that category but not excluding the usually non-bracketed Didonic style: [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=century+expanded&amp;q=Go|Century Expanded]] is not bad, [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=miller+text&amp;q=Go|Miller Text]] is better but in both cases the descenders are too short for longer texts. I have the same problem with the regular weight of [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/eames/viewfonts|Eames Century Modern]]. Besides of that, the italic with its tightly-knit begin- and end strokes is far too nervous for book typography. [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=new+century+schoolbook&amp;q=Go|(New) Century Schoolbook]] may be slightly more appropriate. [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Bodoni+Twelve&amp;q=Go|ITC Bodoni Twelve]] looks OK, but it may be too quirky for Borges rationalist attitude. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/kepler/|Kepler]] is more regular, but tends too much to the transitional style. Less transitional than one might expect from the way it is usually classified is Baskerville. A version of Baskerville with the appropriate lower contrast needed for text sizes could probably do a great job here. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/baskerville-book-pro/|Berthold Baskerville Book]] has the right colour I think. The same goes for [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/baskerville-pro/|Berthold Baskerville]], but it is rather clumsy compared with the Book version, the italic is too dark and the bolder weights lack contrast. That typeface family does not have that much in common with Baskerville anyway. One should be aware of the fact that foundries such as URW and Linotype sell Berthold Baskerville as Baskerville too, but that does not make them much better. Monotype and ITC Baskerville are far too light [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/baskerville-classico/|Linotype’s Baskerville Classico]] looks decent, but one has to put it to the test to make shure.</p>
<p>Personally, I would do some testing with [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_cellini_ot/ot_ps|FF Cellini]] by Albert Boton. Especially because it has the typical 19th century rationalist look, which is a bit more condensed.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Caledonia is a beautiful typeface, but a bit skinny when compared to the metal version. I think that the hairlines of New Caledonia LT are a bit too thin for a text typeface. I also like Berthold Walbaum Book, but I think the stem are a bit too dark. Makes it too spotty / sparkling for a text typeface. Berthold Walbaum Standard is much better as a text typeface, also much better than the Monotype version which is too skinny. Also I think that Justus Erich Walbaum would probably rotate in his grave if he’d see how quirky that interpretation is. The disadvantage of Berthold Walbaum Standard might be slope of the italic. It provides a clear contrast to the roman, but at the risk of creating too much unrest on the page.</p>
<p>When you need a typeface for student project, some foundries may supply you with a ‘student license’. Usually that means that you do not have to pay for it, but are not allowed to use it after having finished your study and for commercial projects. Give it a try at the foundry in question, I’d say …</p>
<p>When classifying according to Thibaudeau, Baskerville clearly belongs into the Didot group.</p>
