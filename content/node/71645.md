  body: "There are several fonts that look like this, mostly freebies. Of course,
    when you want them, they are hard to find.\r\n\r\nThe best I can do for now is
    DoorJamb, available here:\r\nhttp://www.webpagepublicity.com/free-fonts-d3.html\r\n\r\nNot
    even dafont has anything similar under the names door, jamb, or wedge. Googling
    <em>font doorjamb</em> just results in many sites for replacing a Front Door."

  body: "Hi there,\r\nYour observations are on target... just when you need it, where
    is it? lol I've saved this one (and the other gold one that I asked for an id)
    since 2003. I've been hoping in all that time that I might ever find out what
    it is. You've helped a lot. Please take a look at the other id request that I
    made. Its subject line is- \"Can you id this gold font please?\"  Thanks, Renaissance
    Man.\r\n"

  body: "David Rakowski revived an old film type, whose name I can't recall (don't
    have my books here), and he called it <a href=\"http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/rakowski/dr6/davy_f6.htm\">\"Wedgie\"</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    can't see the whole font, but at least this is what your sample seems to match.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Rakowski's version (per Mike's link) is is dated 3/23/96, although it's copyrighted
    in 1991.\r\n\r\nDoorJamb, copyrighted 1992-94, has a more glyphs.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    they seem the same."
