  digitally. I actually contacted Martin who designed this font in the 70s' and confirmed
  that is has never been digitized. \r\n\r\nI desperately need this font for a project.
  Does anyone have an original Letraset sheet or  Letraset book that has a page this
  alphabet in it that they could scan for me at 1200 dpi / ppi please? I would greatly
  appreciate it. I have attached an image of what I need.  Thanks so much ~ Ted"
