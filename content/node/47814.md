body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a way to calculate \"sidebearings\" in
  a Python script by using (or approximating) FontLab's measurement line. I put \"sidebearings\"
  in quotes because I actually want the distance between the edge of the glyph and
  where the measurement line first crosses a contour. I know that I'm able to run
  a macro like <code>fl.font.measurement = 0</code> to set the height of the measurement
  line, but what I don't know is how to get the values of the modified sidebearings
  that are shown in the Metrics window when the measurement line is on.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a similar attribute in FontLab's glyph object that isn't documented? Or is
  there another easy way to calculate this using the contour?\r\n\r\nAs a temporary
  solution, I have been able to use RoboFab's <code>contour.pointInside()</code> to
  get these values by periodically testing points within the bounding box. However,
  I want to be able to easily get these values for hundreds of glyphs at a time, and
  this method is quite taxing. There must be an easier way!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance
  for your help, and my apologies if the answer is already out there. I couldn't find
  anything with a quick search.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDavid"
