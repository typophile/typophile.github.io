  know because everything I've seen is in foreign currency.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping,\r\n\r\nMike

    is why you have not heard from me yet.\r\n\r\nNo, we haven't got US distribution
    set up. All our font prices are in UK Pound Sterling. But if you have a look on
    our website you'll find that we have created a quick conversion into a few currencies,
    incl. US Dollar. Note that they may not be fully accurate but give you a good
    indication of what yor charge will be on your Credit Card.\r\n\r\nBruno Maag"
