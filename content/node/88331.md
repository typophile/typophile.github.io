    perhaps they'll have some testimonials from satisfied clients that you could use

  body: This was surely the case in the vinyl days when cover art was 12" square.  Even
    CDs in an old fashioned record store were often point-of-purchase gotta-haves.  I
    don't know how the online download method has affected this.  Even though you
    can see images online, it does not have the same angst as being in a store and
    wondering if the album will be there the next time.

  body: No, Hrant.  The simple truth is that the abilities of graphic designers follows
    the same bell shaped curve as with every other profession.  Some are quite good
    and some are quite bad with the usual distribution between.  The difference today
    is that designers are not hired to do work based on their ability in low profit
    margin products.  They are hired on price.  It would be the same in type design
    if fonts were chosen based on price instead of quality.  When this happens, the
    upper end of the curve gets cut off and you have skewed  the curve.

    \u201Cprofessionals\u201D were guilty of over-design, i.e. inappropriate design,
    bad design.\r\nI wouldn't say that they were navel-gazing, but just doing what
    they thought was right, i.e. producing slick and sophisticated work.\r\nHowever,
    it missed the mark.\r\n\r\nWhen I was designing covers for Harlequin romances,
    my creative director made one point very clear early on: the customers were expecting
    a good relaxing read, not to be confronted with the challenge of \u201Cliterature\u201D.
    That message should be made clear by the cover.\r\n\r\nAlso consider price: if
    a design looks too good for the price (or the subject matter), it will suggest
    that there is something wrong with the content, and the publisher is trying to
    deceive shoppers.\r\n"

    with Monserrat Caballe and Pavarotti in the lead roles.  [They never performed
    it but made the recording.]  I looked for the recording in stacks at record stores
    by trying to find the familiar cover art that I knew well.  I never found it.
    \ Years later, I found out that they had changed the cover art.  I might have

    long run because this particular customer base needs to appreciate craft and beauty
    much more than what is the case today ... but that's another other story.)\r\n\r\nSo

    rather than willful ignorance or self-indulgence.\r\nAs Chris noted, this is a
    general problem with professionalism, with the emphasis on \u201Cgeneral\u201D.\r\nOne
    is taught general principles and standard procedures, with the focus on certain
    major and prestigious areas of design. But in the workaday world these standards
    have to be fine-tuned to particular markets and user groups, and if these are
    niches such as book jacket design, no matter how good a designer you are, you
    will be out of your depth at first. \r\n\r\nThe publisher shares some responsibility
    for the cock-up, Frode, because the design process is a synergistic relationship
    involving client and supplier.\r\n\r\nWhen I was designing covers for a small
    indie publisher, he would always mock up a dummy book with the cover design, place
    it on a typical store bookshelf, and view it in a walk-by. For this client, I
    would usually prepare two or three options.\r\n\r\nI never attended the executive
    meetings at Harlequin in which covers were vetted, but my CD told me that the
    panel would look at each cover for a split second before giving it the yay or
    nay -- brutal, no time for creatives' rationalizations. For that client, I would
    prepare sometimes dozens of options.\r\n"

    with each page turn yielding a different disk.  A few years later when 33 1/3
    became a normal speed, an album containing 4 disks would now fit on one 33 1/3
    disk.  Even though the larger disk was a single piece of vinyl, it kept the name
    \"Album\".  A typical album had about 16 songs.  There were also \"Double albums\"
    like the Beatles \"White Album\" which contained 2 disks.  After the CD came out
    and single release songs were not sold anymore, the name album gave way to the
    name \"CD\".  Album cover became CD cover.  Now that it is all digital online
    sales they will most likely fade into a new name."
