body: "Hello,\r\nI would like to know how one would properly arrange a date like this
  (i.e. including the weekday) in English:\r\nIs it<ul><li>on Saturday, 21 July 2007</li>\r\n<li>on
  Saturday, 21th July 2007</li>\r\n<li>on Saturday, July 21th 2007</li>\r\n<li>or
  something else?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat about comma placement, potential abbrevation?\r\nWould
  it be different if a time indication followed\u2014like <cite>on Saturday, 21 July
  2007, 18\u201320h</cite>?\r\nBtw, does it <strong>have</strong> to be am/pm, or
  would 24h be understandable?\r\n\r\nBritish or American or Canadian style? Well,
  what have you got? International English?\r\nThank you very much!"

    aiding clarity, and the order is logical... if you decide to use punctuation,
    then it would be\r\n\r\non Saturday, 21 July, 2007.\r\n\r\nbut it is not strictly
    necessary\r\n\r\noh, and if you do decide to use the number suffixes, it is 21st
    (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th... etc)"

    punctuation to break things up...\r\n\r\n on Saturday 21 July 2007, 6pm.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\non
    Saturday 21 July 2007, 6-11pm\r\n\r\nthis also avoids the american/uk confusion
    over the day/month (month/day) order\r\n\r\n"

  body: "it's fine to abbreviate names, but if you do, probably best to abbreviate
    the day as well\r\n\r\nso\r\n\r\nSat. 22 Sept. 2007, 6-11pm\r\n\r\nor  even\r\n\r\nSat
    22 Sept 2007, 6-11pm\r\n\r\ndepending on your level of pedantry re. signifying
    abbreviation... as you're not putting p.m., i think the second is more consistent\r\n\r\nall
    the best\r\n\r\nbrett"

  body: "I personally don't like ordinals (1st, etc.) written with a combination of
    number and letters -- I'd use \"first\" etc. and would also spell out the day
    of the week and month.  It's not pedantic: if anything, the abbreviations are
    lazy, and there are too many styles that want different abbreviations in different
    ways to stay consistent.\r\n\r\nAnd for times, well, that's another kettle of
    fish.  I like the 24-hour clock with all four digits written, but it's not common
    here in North America, except in Quebec, and if one must use a.m. and p.m., use
    periods.  Brett's second example might be something I'd write on a calendar for
    a party to remind my husband, but never in a publication."

  body: "It is a British English convention to put the date before the month in this
    type of usage. I personally prefer this form, but here in the States, the more
    typical convention would be\r\n\r\n<em>on Saturday, July 21, 2007.</em>\r\n\r\nYou
    may find more Americans using the European <em>date-month-year</em> form than
    you used to, but I believe it is still more common to see <em>month-day-year.</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    ordinal form is not generally used, even though it might be read that way out
    loud. (And btw, it would be 21st, not 21th.)\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"
