  that works on Mac and PC.\r\nI based it on another font with FontLab and than generated
  the font in OT/TT.\r\nI works well apart from the problem that the german \xDC\xD6\xC4
  and so on do not appear properly when you change a text from another typeface (for
  example in InDesign) into it. Other glyphs appear than.\r\nBut the strange thing
  is: when you write it over again newly, \xD6\xDC\xC4 properly appear.\r\nWhat defect
  is this? \r\n\r\nGuess it has to do something with encoding.\r\n\r\n\r\nbelow an
  image of what I did.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nStefan[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-1_5675.gif]"

    Switch to Unicode encoding, and check if the characters have the right Unicode
    code.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Fontlab can even translate them for you."

    shot. And we all see that characters have proper Unicode indices. The thing which
    indeed must be checked is glyph names.\r\n\r\nJohnych"

  body: Ah. Well, if the unicode values <em>are</em> correct, Stefan could simply
    discard the existing glyph names and use Fontlab's predefined list. I think that
    can be done quite easily (albeit on a per-character basis).

  body: Could it also have to do with an old version of the font, still in a font
    cache? Maybe as a test rename the font, other ID's etc and see what happens.
