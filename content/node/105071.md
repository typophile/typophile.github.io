  detectors. My closest result is the Futura and 20-th Century family. \r\nThey come
  close but they're not perfect matches. Can anybody help identify this font.\r\n\r\n<img

    versions of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]], they differ, sometimes
    much, from one to another. Some considerations to keep in mind too that could
    explain the differences: letterpress, distortion, angle, blur, original scale
    (?)...'
