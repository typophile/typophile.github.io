body: Hi.  <BR> <BR>I see that many nice fonts appearing on this forum and I wanted
  to post one of my own to see your reaction. <BR>It&#39;s not meant to be readible
  at small sizes. I dare people to use it big. Best used for posters, flyers, etc.  <BR>
  <BR>I tried to keep the width of the letters the same. The numerals are wider and
  a little heavier. Therefore they stick out a little bit more. I tried to break the
  vertical character of the letters a bit by creating some &#39;thick&#39; areas &#40;a,
  e&#41;. This gives the font also a little rhythem. Otherwise it would be too rigid,
  not? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12031.jpg" alt="Nantua">
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m finalizing the font but have my problems with the lowercast P and
  the R. The difference is too small. Perhaps I should cut of the upper right point
  of the P to make it more round. Then it also sticks out more from the R. Or perhaps
  the stem of the P should sink under the X-height. <BR> <BR>Any more suggestions?

  body: Hi phillip, <BR> <BR>thanx for your tip. The upper version looks nice. Only
    thing is that I want to keep the vertical openings equally big. That keeps it
    consistent in style.  <BR>You&#39;re right that the &#39;p&#39; and &#39;r&#39;
    looked to much the same. I will try it and see if it still fits in the global
    idea of the font. I need to see it in a textblock. <BR> <BR>I sold it by the way
    to Union Fonts. Very soon it will be available online for sale. <BR> <BR>How are
    you doing with your fonts. I saw a lot of them in this forum and I really like
    them. If you ask me, I think you have a good eye for it. Keep it up. <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR>Ren

  body: Hi phillip, <BR> <BR>How about this?  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12556.gif"
    alt="PR"> <BR> <BR>Perhaps that fits better to the style of the font? The little
    sharp diagonal edge made me a little &#39;nervous&#39;. In this way you keep the
    openness of the font without breaking the overall look-and-feel. <BR> <BR> <BR>What
    do you think? <BR> <BR>Ren

  body: it&#39;s good, it does match the rest of the font better, yet it&#39;s different
    enough from the &#34;p&#34;. cheers. <BR> <BR>-phillip
