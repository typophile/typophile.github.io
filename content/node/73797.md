body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI need to re-create this logo in a vector format for the
  client but they don't know what the font is.  Can anyone on here ID it?  It's the
  serifs on the middle bars of the 'F' and 'E' which seem to be the most unique characters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GPF-LEWIS-LOGO_6156.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nSimon"
