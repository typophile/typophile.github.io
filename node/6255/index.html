<div class=commentbody>I suggest you ditch the helmet-crest... as Cristian said, it's a bit heavy on top. I think the alternate characters would be sufficient to create a uniquene look, and the very Roman typeface creates all the historical reference you would ever need.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi guys, <br> <br>Thanks for the feedback! <br>I have made some modifications and agree that the crest is throwing the balance out, but the client wants it in <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif alt=:-( border=0> <br> <br>Christian, thanks for your comments, I have tried to implement your suggestions on the A's and the SPA-TAN spacing. Its hard without getting into monospace. <br> <br>Hrant, you showed me Trajic when I was looking for reference (Ancient style Greek/Roman thread) and it was exactly the concept I was going for! ;) <br> <br>So here is the latest: <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4672.jpg alt=Spartan2> <br> <br>As I said, I had to keep the helmet/crest but hopefully its not as heavy. <br>Let me know what you think! <br> <br>Thanks for all your help <br> <br>Brennan</div>

<div class=commentbody>The only comment I could add would be to suggest not using a modified 'P'. I think the P detracts from the main focal point--the 'R'. Using a complete P may also help with the spacing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I second Darrel's suggestion to use a normal P. Think about it: the justification for the R is that the left side of the counter forms the nose-piece of the helmet. There is no such justification for repeating this shape in the P. It looks odd, and it draws attention away from the R. <br> <br>Personally, I would try this with <i>only</i> the R having an abnormal shape (and the T, of course, where it is cut off by the crest of the helmet). I think it is a mistake to remove the crossbars of the A's: sure it looks Greek, but it looks like two uppercase <i>lambdas</i>, which confuses me into reading it as SPLRTLN. Actually, in the context of the two pseudo-<i>lambdas</i>, the cut-off T begins to look a lot like a <i>gamma</i>. And then do I read the P as Latin P or Greek <i>rho</i>? SRLRGLN, anyone? <br> <br>Making Latin letters look like non-corresponding Greek letters is a bit naff: like reversing the letter R to make things look 'Russian'.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with Darrel about the S. It is a little narrow, and the curve is weak and the counters areas poorly balanced. Take the top terminal a little to the right, and then increase the curvature of the stroke so you can increase the size of the top counter area. <br> <br>Top of the P looks a little heavy, but that might just be the screen rendering.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Brennan - This has come along very nicely. A few minor suggestions... <br> <br>* spacing between AP and AN a few nudges tighter. <br>* look at the tail on the R. For some reason it looks fat where it connects to the bowl. (just a tad) <br> <br> <br>bj<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6300.jpg alt=spart.jpg></div>

<div class=commentbody>This isn't essential, but you could drop the crossbar on the A a little lower. If the logo is likely to be reproduced quite small, or in poor printing conditions (newspaper ads?) this would probably be adviseable, to stop the top counter filling in.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Or make the bars chevrons, which would both open up the counters* and make it look more Ancient Greek! <br> <br>* If you wanted to avoid clotting at smaller sizes, you'd need to worry about those helmet parts too... so maybe a separate version for small usage, with a more open "A" and fewer, larger, helmet segments? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi guys, thanks for all the input. Lots of suggetions there ;) <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6324.jpg alt=spartanV20> <br> <br>I have fixed the "S" (almost) and closed the "N". I think it looks much better. <br>Dropped the crossbar on the "A" and tightened the spacing between P-A, A-N. <br>Have also made small size comparisons. <br>1. same as large <br>2. reworked the helmet segments and added circles to compensate for the crossbar (not sure about that) <br>3. original with new "S" & "N" <br> <br>Hrant, I didnt understand the "chevron" so I interpreted that with circles ;) <br>BJ, tried to make the tail of the "R" smaller, but it looked odd. Will try again. <br>Darrel/John, is the S-N width resolved? <br>Colin, how is the top counter of the "S" looking now? <br>Stephen, thanks ;) <br> <br> <br>Thanks again everyone ;) <br> <br>Bren</div>

<div class=commentbody>A chevron here would be like a very shallow "V", instead of a straight horizontal bar. <br> <br>Looking nice. The #2 works well small, although I don't like those dots. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>This is looking good. The progress is great to see. <br> <br>I am with Hrant. Ditch the dots. <br> <br>The "S" and the "P" seem cramped to me compared to the rest. More space here might be good. <br> <br>-smc </div>

Here is a tryout but it needs a little working. thanks for the suggestion. <br> <br> <br>The client is in tow minds about the latest version and the last with no crossbar on the "A". I'm slowly talking them around ;) <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>There's something distracting about the chevrons. Either they're too thin and/or too curved. <br> <br>Otherwise great! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>brennan, i agree about the chevrons, persobally i think there are too many attractive pints in this logo, you should focus only in one, the Rhelmet. <br> <br>for me the As whithout the horizontals works fine. <br> <br>you shoud be carefull with little things now, the serif union betwen P and A should fuse like TAN, the upper part of the S should be more horizontal, the terminal of the S should be thicker in the bottom, for me it looks thicker on the upper terminal. <br> <br>you should also define wich numbers of division in the helmet works better, if this logo will be used mainly in small applications it should be these one, the number 2 on your february 6 post <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6442.jpg alt="SMALL SPARTAN"> <br> <br>Cya <br>CG</div>

<div class=commentbody>There seems to be a relatively excessive amount of space between the A and N. This type of N could be the solution. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6461.jpg alt="Spartan N.jpg"></div>

<div class=commentbody>Re: the dots. I agree, they're distracting / detracting. <br> <br>Re: the crossbars. This works fine without them. <br>(Not that historical accuracy is paramount for your <br>project, but didn't crossbars come much later than the <br>Greeks?) <br> <br>By the way, this has come a long way since your <br>original post. Very nice.</div>

<div class=commentbody>No dots and no bars looks best. It simplifies the logo. It has a lot to it already. <br> <br>The helmet I would agree needs something like #2 treatment. If there are two many "divisions" it is going to be hard to keep it from plugging when printed smaller. And I am sure it is likely to print smaller than we see here. <br> <br>I think that with what you have at this point less is going to be more. It looks good. The "S" does look better. <br> <br>-smc</div>
