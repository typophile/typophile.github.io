body: So, I'm remaking this logo but need to know the name of the font used to create
  the original logo. I've included a snapshot of the typeface in the word "GRIP" to
  possibly help identify it. But I've also included the actual logo in how it was
  used. Any help would be greatly appreciated.!!!
