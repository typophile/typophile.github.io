  book with detailed tips/instructions on perfect letterforms made in Illustrator.
  I'm talking details like where to pull the handle on a bezier curve to make the
  perfect bowl, how to get rid of a lump in a shoulder, etc. More detailed than you'd
  get in your average Illustrator everything-in-short-summary book.\r\n\r\nI found
  something like this a few years ago, but didn't buy it (because I am an idiot).
  I remember the design of the book being rather funky and jokey, lots of oranges
  and yellows, and it may have been a soft cover.\r\n\r\nAny ideas of what that book
  might have been, or recommendations for a good book to use in perfecting pen tool
  skills?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nM'lyn"

    production tools from FontLab, including the cheaper ones, have some advantages.
    You can try drawing in them for free with demo versions and see for yourself. '

    body: "Thanks for the tip.\r\n\r\nPart of why I want the book is just to become
      more adept at using Illustrator. I figured that having something specific to
      practice on, like letterforms, would be a good way to direct the activity. Plus,
      there are plenty of times when one wants to create a single good-looking letter
      without having to create a font for it."

  body: Fontographer (now with Fontlab) still has the most user friendly drawing tools
    around - I hope that Fontlab will use that format in the future - very easy to
    change, merge points, etc.
