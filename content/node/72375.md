    that had reader-choice multiple storylines.\r\n\r\nMany ideas that are assumed
    to be \"futuristic\" and \"digital\" have precedents in analog culture. Bach's

    the series were released for the Amazon Kindle. The interface works by having
    links instead of page turns for the choices.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the iPad version
    is in the works..."
