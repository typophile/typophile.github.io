  is where I am at the moment. This is all in optical since I haven't done kerning
  yet, but hopefully you can get something out of it and give some feedback.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your time!\r\n\r\nJaakko"

  body: "Hello Jaakko,\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful for the people who will give you
    feedback to know how your typeface will be used, i.e. the typeface will be used
    for signage or for setting document texts.\r\n\r\nI will retain from making any
    comments on the design as I'm no expert.\r\n\r\n\r\nSB"

  body: The typeface will be used on web and print. Both as display and body. I will
    also make bold and italic.

  body: So this is meant to be read by 4-5 year olds?  The /g/ is very odd and the
    /y/ too.  Usually one would try to keep the standard forms of letters for those
    just learning to recognize them.  What exactly was the goal of using a custom
    face instead of one of the many available ones?

  body: "Mainly the parents of the kids will be reading the text. Mainly kids will
    learn to read when their school starts, during Kindergarten only few according
    to my knowledge will learn to read, reading is not taught in Kindergarten. In
    kindergarten kids ages vary from 3-6 years olds.\r\n\r\nThe goal of using a custom
    typeface is to create a visual identity that has it's own characteristics starting
    from the simplest form in itself, letter. The custom typeface is meant to be both
    playful and stylish and is used also in the company's logotype without modifications.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think you have succeeded in creating something which has a definite style.
    I particularly like the k and j and y. \r\nI would look at the lower case s again
    - it doesn't feel balanced to me, seems to be leaning forwards whereas most of
    the letters are very upright. I also would suggest restyling the lower case e
    - for me there is too much weight on top or it seems to sit lower as if the mid-line
    drops and it breaks up the flow when I am reading it.\r\nLastly, just the tapering
    on the m and n aren't quite perfect, imo."

  body: "Thank you Tanya!:) I have to admit that i feel like e, n, m  are the hardest
    letters to make. I tried to fix few things, but maybe e needs still work? And
    tapering of h, n, m, u also?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/custom_2_5269.jpg]"

  body: "I think that, at least at text sizes, y\u2019s tail looks leaning to the
    right, and g\u2019s lower bowl could be a bit larger."
