  her book cover. While this is annoying, we generally try to be somewhat accommodating
  if at all possible. We used her image, a painting of a Western woman in Asian dress,
  but changed her font to Broadband with brighter colors. She objected saying the
  font was "Orientalizing".  Do you think Broadband is orientalized and therefore
  offensive?

  body: "Broadband is strongly informed, to put it politely, by Neville Brody's Insignia,
    which, if it has cultural allusions, would be neo-constructivist.\r\nThat is its
    provenance; however, any style may be perceived as something other than its origins\u2014look
    at what happened to Koch's Neuland."

    Graphic Designers edit her manuscript...

  body: "Nick, have you made fonts from any of Will H. Bradley's lettering?\r\nI was
    reminded of him by this post, he was something of a polymath\u2014illustrated,
    designed, lettered, wrote plays, directed movies, designed Royal Doulton figurines,
    &c. &c.\r\n\r\nBradley and another Will, Morris (among others) we will admit to
    designing covers for their own literature :-)"

    awhile back, and I am holding a sample of logo lettering The Man did for the Brown
    Folding Machine Company in 1891 in reserve, until a particularly wacky mode strikes
    me (to suit the lettering)."

  body: "I had a client tell me something similar about some lettering I made for
    her once; she said it was too \u201CAsian-inspired.\u201D I was privately a little
    offended, both because the white girl was telling the Japanese guy what\u2019s
    Asian, and because I usually find \u201CAsian-inspired\u201D anything generally
    tasteless.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don\u2019t see anything remotely Asian about that
    typeface."

    as much as fortune cookies being chinese origin. No chinese has ever seen a fortune
    cookie before in their entire life.
