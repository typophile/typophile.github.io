  to make it simple and clean with large x-height and roundish forms to look big and
  clear when printed at smaller sizes.\r\nI'd love to hear your comments and critique
  :)"

  body: "It's a very good start. Anyway, it still resembles very much a slight extended
    Meta Serif mixing a bit of Guardian (in lowercase) and Greta Text (in uppercase,
    especially serifs). Some points:\r\n\r\n<strong>01</strong>. |g| lower bowl has
    a very small gap and its right curves are irregular. The ear would use a thinner
    connection to upper bowl.\r\n\r\n<strong>02</strong>. |J| descender uses a somewhat
    abrupt curve while |j| descender lacks expressivity.\r\n\r\n<strong>03</strong>.
    |S|s| curves are irregular.\r\n\r\n<strong>04</strong>. |R| leg does not fits
    overall style.\r\n\r\n<strong>05</strong>. Uppercase vertical serifs (C, E, F,
    G, L, S, T) are very large and thick, not proportional to horizontal serifs.\r\n\r\n<strong>06</strong>.
    Top of |t| is large and a bit rude.\r\n\r\n<strong>07</strong>. |Q| tail seems
    very thick. Maybe a thinner link to base curve would improve it."

  body: "- Push the bottom serif of the /S/ a bit to the right. Same goes for the
    /s/.\r\n- I don't know if it's just me, but the /e/ looks too round. Alone it
    looks right, but draw it nearer to the for of the /p/.\r\n- The descender of the
    /J/ is too sharp. Use your /R/ as a reference.\r\n\r\nThe /R/ looks much better
    than before. I like your /a/ and /Q/. You're good, keep going :)"

  body: "These wedge serifs are too uneven to my opinion. On /a/f/ are a too wide
    to my taste.\r\n\r\nI don't think that /g/ complements the style of other letters.
    It doesn't have the same <em>edginess</em> as others.\r\n\r\nThe bottom curve
    of /C/e/ is too far to the right and makes the letter unstable (falling to the
    left).\r\n\r\nI find /Q/C/D/U/Z/u/ to be a but too wide. /b/ probably as well
    but I'm not so sure about that.\r\n\r\n/q/ looks a bit wider than /p/. Most probably
    because of the a different top (which is correct btw).\r\n\r\nThe new /R/ is a
    very good improvement even though I'd try with an angled stroke. It would still
    be curved, but would have a bit of an angle just a bit after the tail curve starts.
    It would give it a bit edginess that will complement those wedged serifs.\r\n\r\nHave
    you considered cutting the vertical bit of serifs - the short vertical line at
    the end of serif) to be cut at an angle? Leaning to the right? It may give type
    a bit of a faster reading feel and dynamism. Although it would be seen on larger
    sizes only. But is maybe worth a try. It's just a suggestion anyway.\r\n\r\nAnd
    definitely try top cut /r/ ear with an angular stroke instead of vertical one.
    Same could go to /y/.\r\n\r\n<strong>But all in all I find this wedge serif style
    very nice and consistent.</strong> I don't think there are many wedge serif styled
    families that are really good that the whole style would complement this rather
    geometric serif. This simply means you should keep on doing this great work."
