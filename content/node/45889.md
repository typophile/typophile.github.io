  and in white on a black background. I've heard that some designers make the inverted
  logo version a bit lighter to counter balance the optical illusion that makes it
  look bolder. \r\nHow common is this? Is it really necessary or does it just complicate
  things? And  how much lighter should it be. Are there any general rules? I have
  been trying this out so much that I have lost all judgement."

    white lettering on a black background the rule is to 'go up' one weight on the
    letters (i.e. if you are using book you should go to medium). It does make a difference,
    if we let it stay in book it appears to be smaller then it is. All the best.\r\n\r\nPedro

  body: "Traditionally, reversed type would be slightly heavier for two reasons:\r\n\r\n
    - ink creep \r\n - visual balance compared to the non-reversed type\r\n\r\nSo,
    in the case of your logo, it really just depends on how it's going to be used,
    sizes it will be printed at, etc."

  body: What aluminum said. I learned about this in design school. If I'm not mistaken,
    Hoefler & Frere-Jones took this into account for one of their proprietary magazine
    fonts, making a slightly bolder version of a typeface for cases where it would
    be reversed out.

  body: "I see... So if I'm taking into consideration ink creep then there should
    be at least one bolder version for small print and one less so for larger sizes.\r\n\r\nSince
    it's a logo it will be used in several sizes, printed on different material and
    with different techniques, and I will not be able or present to adjust it every
    time. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I'm not sure my client will see the difference but instead
    be rather annoyed by the hassle of having a huge number of logo files. I should
    mention that this is a quite small business, so there will be no team of inhouse
    designers ready to assure that the logo is reproduced perfectly every time..."

  body: For a logo you could just make a second version, and increase the thickness
    by a small percentage... I wish I had an actual number to give you! I'm sure someone
    has worked it out before.

  body: "It is perfectly acceptable to make a logo in multiple sizes and weights.
    All this together along with documentation for their appropriate use comprise
    a corporate identity system manual, which you can charge a lot more for than a
    single logo.\r\n\r\nBut for a small business, limit their choices as much as is
    practical, i.e.: direct them to use one most of the time, and the bolder one when
    reversed out or below a certain size. Clear simple rules, ne?"

    a system well is a part of the design.

  body: It may also depend on the sizes at which you're expecting the logo to be used.
    If it's small (reversed on a businesscard, say) then you might need to do it.
    If it's to be used at a larger size, then it might not really be noticable.
