  body: "Hey nick\r\nSo I spend 30 or so minutes looking it up for you. It's not definite,
    but it seems that NBC Universal's in-house team* in Universal City, CA uses your
    font. It includes theme park, web, PR, and promos. But I didn't see it on stuffs
    designed by the New York team (news, daytime program).\r\n\r\n*nbc site's meta
    tag, author: NBC.com Web Development/Engineer Team\r\n\r\nNote that NBC Universal
    is a subsidiary branch of GE. A company with their own teams of designers and
    uses multiple agencies. So I could be totally wrong. \r\n\r\nHere are the screen
    shot of the nbc site for prosperity  \r\n\r\n[[http://www.jwchen.com/share/nbcindex.png|website]]\r\n[[http://www.jwchen.com/share/nbcpromo.png|promotions

  body: Nick -- It's just now showing up on TV as the network is only just launching
    its new season this week. Looks good, too. (Although, I have to say I will miss
    Antenna.)

  body: I saw it on the tube (yes, mine is still a CRT) last night. IMO, it looks
    much better in broadcast than it does on the web (where it already looked pretty
    nice). it's a great fit for their light-hearted comedy focus. congratulations,
    Nick! maybe we'll start seeing it in the MyFonts Rising Stars newletters!
