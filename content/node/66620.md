    widths probably comes from a certain\r\nstyle of Armenian lettering. Example:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/3790822917/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the setting.\r\n- More interestingly: I was suggesting that the large variance
    in widths might be a cultural migration from Armenian to Cyrillic (especially
    since this lettering was done by Armenians).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
