  body: 'Jason could you try another painting using ink on rice paper. Chinese/Japanese
    calligraphy is outrageous. You have to balance the speed of the strokes and the
    dryness/wetness of the brush. Plus you have to lift the brush off the paper after
    a stroke. Its much more diffucult than acrylics and will teach you much more about
    how a character is formed. '

  body: "Hi Jason. It's hard to tell exactly what's going on with the surface of your
    painting, but you might try the following:\r\n\r\nActually paint the white. It
    looks like a white canvas with a black fleuron. In painting, it's important to
    spend as much time on the background as the foreground. The edge of the fleuron
    should be made by an actual edge between the figure and ground, where black paint
    meets white. Not by black paint on top of white. Franz Klein was great at this
    sort of thing. This might speak to Hrant's concept of 'notan' even. Or, perhaps,
    Noordzij's 'front'. \r\n\r\nFrom the photo, it looks like the typography (the
    <em>what</em>) is winning our over the painting (the <em>how</em>). Seems like
    there should be more of a balance between the two. This could be due in part to
    the spray paint, which is rather dead and doesn't make for a very painterly surface.\r\n\r\nYou
    might try to mix your black instead of using black out of the tube. Pthalo blue
    and Alizarin crimson make a nice 'black'. Really it's a deep transparent purple,
    but you can layer it into a very rich black. Also, Payne's Grey mixed with similarly
    deep hues can make a decent black. Same goes for white. Don't use Titanium white
    from the tube -- throw some Ochre into it (just a bit) or it'll always be chalky
    and cold.\r\n\r\nMake it bigger if possible. The gesture of the fleuron will probably
    be enormously helped by a larger scale.\r\n\r\nI hate to tell people to look at
    this and that painter, but you might be interested in the work of Christopher
    Wool.\r\n\r\nCheers."

    Hrant, that would be more of an ultimate <em>type design</em> painting because
    it focuses on a particular aspect of a character --  a detail.\r\n\r\nFor me,
    a <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/feature/pollock/painting1.shtm\" target=\"new\">typographic
    painting</a> would encompass contrast, balance, juxtaposition of minute repetitive
    elements within the confines of the canvas or page size. IMHO you need not recognize
    minutia since it is the overall affect that is critical.\r\n\r\n"

    was really more exploratory since I'm not sure what mediums to use yet and also
    because I've never painted before. Also, I do intend to make the scale quite larger.

    simple Google Image search yields good results, also.\r\n\r\nHard to tell on some
    of these thumbnails, but in person his works are quite engaging in their surface
    and technique (not all are painted -- some are prints). \r\n\r\nGranted, your
    intent appears to be different than Ruscha's, but it's still an excellent point
    of reference.\r\n"
