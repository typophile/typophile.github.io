  body: "If I'm not mistaken, Stanley was Panache's version of (the original name,
    along with VGC F-32) Apache.\r\n\r\nI think, though, that what was used was the
    slightly wider August/VGC F-35. The only digital versions I know of for August
    are Fontbank's <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/toledo.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Toledo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Brendel's</a>

  body: "I think you're right Mike. August does look to have the right weight and
    width. (I have it in another book, and it shows up in the Solotype Catalog too.)
    You're a treasure trove of knowledge about these digitizations.\r\n\r\n- Mike
