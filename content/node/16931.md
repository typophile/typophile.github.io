  body: "I have many, but these are my current favorites:\r\n\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=balance\">FF
    Balance</a> - This has so much character merely because the stress is horizontal
    rather than vertical. Looks great every time I see it (which is sadly too rare).</li>\r\n<li><a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=strada\">FF
    Strada</a> - Simple forms mixed with some organic terminals and a thoughtful italic.
    Mmm. <a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/14/20098053_1f82de0bbc_o.jpg\">Another
    sample of FF Strada.</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.10989.0.0\">FF
    Quadraat Sans</a> - There is experienced method behind the lack of uniformity.</li>
    \r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11100.0.0\">FF Profile</a>
    - Has a friendly air for less serious texts.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=legato\">FF
    Legato</a> - This groundbreaking design requires some reading to fully appreciate.
    <a href=\"http://typographi.com/000969.php\">Start&nbsp;here.</a></li>\r\n<li><a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=versa%20sans\">Versa
    Sans</a> - More brilliance from a Dutch master.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=GF.118889.0.0\">Freight
    Sans</a> - Excellent <a href=\"http://www.joshuadarden.com\">complimentary styles</a>
    available too. I recommend loosening the spacing a tad.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=amplitude\">Amplitude</a>
    - The Normal and Wide are really great for small print.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000081\">Lisboa
    Sans</a> - Veer mailed a sans poster a few weeks ago and this new release was
    the most impressive on the sheet.</li></ul>"

    Legato. And it doesn't hurt that it's the most culturally-significant design since...
    possibly the beginning.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I have been using FF Quadraat Sans quite a bit lately. Possibly due to the
    fact that it is one of the few that I own, but nevertheless! Also, I have always
    admired FF Scala Sans, even more so that Scala Serif. FF Balance and FF Legato
    are pretty magic, as mentioned above. John Sans would be fun to play with, so
    much character! \r\n\r\nKris."

  body: I received <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810949652">this book</a>
    for Christmas, and it is set in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=scala%20sans">Scala
    Sans</a>. The spacing of this typeface has always been a bit problematical, but
    I'm impressed once again by how well it works for continuous text of this sort,
    i.e. interrupted by frequent illustrations that readers will typically pause to
    enjoy. This is the sort of context in which a sans serif can work quite well.

  body: I fell in love with FF Profile! (saw it on "Letter Fountain" book!) It looks
    beautiful! (I'm also a big fan of Scala and Scala Sans families, but for something
    completely different in "feel", I guess.)
