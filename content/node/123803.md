    Grail_ has some similarity to some of the \"pirate\" fonts like Blackmoor http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/blackmoor/
    Windlass http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/windlass/ and captain Kidd http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/captain-kidd/\r\nDon"

    a font like Schnitzle [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SchnitzleAsANOTHER_6221.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/schnitzle-aoe/\r\nSimilar bouncy style
    letters, but in a narrower width, are found in Rather Jazzy http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pintassilgo/rather-both/
    and Lemon Yellow Sun http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hanoded/lemon-yellow-sun/\r\nDon"

  body: "The lettering in _AND NOW! AT LAST!_ has a sort of Looney Tunes style. It
    would be difficult to create the overlap effect with a font, but Marvin Shadow
    captures the spirit [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MarvinShadowAsAND_5884.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/marvin/ For more fonts similar to Marvin
