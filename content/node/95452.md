body: Someone once remarked that the craft of typography has been going downhill ever
  since it was created.  The most recent threat seems to come from grafitti - which
  has now become mainstream rather than marginal - and grunge, hand scribbled fonts
  that some designers seem to prize for their spontaneity.  When did the rot set in?  With
  the introduction of Comic Sans or that potato cut font used by Sainsburys (the UK
  grocery chain) to give itself street credibility?  Does it matter?  Does anyone
  care?  As a type designer who sprends hundreds of hours meticulously honing my productions
  (and hundreds more meticulously kerning them!) I'm beginning to lose faith in the
  integrity of the profession.  Is there anyone out there with me on this?

    was expressed in writing about three thousand years ago.

    the bellwether, look at Myfonts best sellers.\r\nFive years ago, there were far
    more grunge and scripts.\r\nVeer, which specialized in grunge and scripts, is
    reconsolidating under the aegis of Corbis."

  body: I, too, experience an involuntary twinge of discomfort when I see work that
    doesn't display imagination, skill, and care. Alas, I also experience this twinge
    when I see Johannes Gutenberg's name spelled with two <strong>t</strong>'s.
