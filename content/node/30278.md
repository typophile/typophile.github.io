  has unveiled the new Saks identity</a>. Massimo Vignelli's fabulous spencerian logo
  is back, and has been manipulated into some gorgeous new packaging. Now if only
  I could actually afford to shop there...

  body: Hmmm. Isn't one of the points of shopping bags to advertise the store? I'm
    not sure that at a glance this tells you anything at all about where the shopper
    has been, especially not for people who aren't 'in the know' about the new packaging.
    It's conceptually and visually elegant, and I'm glad to see the Optima-esque logo
    (blahhhh) replaced, but I'm not convinced it works as a re-brand.

      yet, I remember seeing somewhere an example of a similar treatment of the logotype
      of the popular ap\xE9ritif, St.Rapha\xEBl. The whole thing using bits and pieces
      of the logo, reassembled in a random order, looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I think
      it worked fine, though. The visual message was loud and clear; it screamed 'St.Rapha'!"

    isn't it sort of safe to assume that people who see the bags are there enough
    that they do know? It seems to fit with the company's decision to dump everything
    but the Saks Fifth Avenue stores and focus on selling luxury."

    give it the potential to gain a high level of recognition. i don't know, for\r\nexample,
    what burberry's bags look like, but if i saw a bag with\r\nthe pattern, i would
    know what store it comes from.\r\n\r\nit seems a (relatively) bold choice and
    i hope it's successful."

    depending upon everyone wanting to be a part of the so-called 'in' crowd and anyone
    in the 'in' crowd would know. It could, perhaps, also be likened to retail where
    they don't use price tags, because as you know, if you have to ask, you can't
    afford it.\r\n\r\nSeriously, I do like it. It seems very eighties which is oh
    so very aughties. I love black and white and I really am happy to see them using
    a script again. "

    It works wonderfully!

    that it's not instantly recognizable.\r\n\r\nWell, yet, anyway. ;-)\r\n\r\nThe
    Canuck equivalent (Holt Renfrew) recently did the same thing -- they went from
    cream-coloured bags with black serif type (hmm, can't remember which: I should
    dig one out and post it) to electric patent pink with white lettering.  I must
    say, I like the Saks remake better...."
