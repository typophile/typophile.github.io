body: I seem to be noticing that InDesign does something strange with the last line
  in a paragraph that is fully justified with a ragged last line. The tracking seems
  to be far tighter then that of the rest of the paragraph that is fully justified.
  I have tried to adjust this, but I cannot seem to find a way other than inserting
  white-spaces or kerning the space between each word individually. There must be
  some better way to fix this, and I am hoping someone here will know.

    that might be the guy you are looking for, knowing the size of you text box and
    so on. Have a pleasant track and kern : )'

  body: "Post a screengrab of your setting for justification. Perhaps you\u2019re
    allowing tracking there or large wordspaces. The last line then, not being justified,
    sets normal. That line, in other words, may be standard, while your normal setting
    could be off.\r\n\r\n"

  body: hrmm...i tried a number of things here, i suppose i really need to learn some
    more advanced usage techniques for setting type with InDesign. Can anyone recommend
    a book that is aimed in large part or has good information concerning this subject
    of setting type. I know how to do most everything, its just these little nuances
    that come up. For now, since it only a one page doc, with only four lines that
    I have an issue with, I just manually added tracked out the words by adding white
    spaces.
