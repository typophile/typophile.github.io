  used font squirrel web font generator http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator\r\n\r\nThe
  fonts have class kerning that works in all applications but the fonts from the web
  font generator don't seem to have any kerning.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something, is
  it possible to have kerning in web fonts.\r\n"

  body: The browser support is very uneven. What works most of the times is a flat
    kerning table, but expanding the class kerning can add significant weight to the
    font files.

  body: "... like Frode said. \r\n\r\nHowever, for some browsers, you can get kerning
    by applying the text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; property in your css.\r\n\r\nThere's
    some more info here:\r\n[[https://www.typotheque.com/articles/opentype_features_in_web_browsers_-_tests#kern]]\r\nalthough
    you have to realize this is a moving target right now. \r\n"
