  body: "Lol, the text is from Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament.\r\n\r\nThis
    is part of the conversation with the client that this sprung from:\r\n\r\nClient
    - \"Something like ancient Cyrillic, but not based on illegible symbols. The Runes
    of the Goths meets the Alphabet of the Kabbala. In fact did you know that the
    David Star can be deconstructed to form every letter in Ancient Hebrew? I've been
    going down this road for a while with my typeface and saw Prometheus this last
    weekend and it seems others are doing the same.\"\r\n\r\nMe - \"I just, I dont
    see those kind of letters form could ever be made to look modern. They are so
    much a medieval connotation to them. I can't stop seeing pictures of whole rooms
    lit by candle light, and darkness, and dracula.\"\r\n\r\nClient - \"Yes you are
    correct, absolutely right... I don't want that look at all but needs its foundation
    in the principles I speak of. Approach as if Anuthin Wongsunkakon were designing
    the logo that appeared on the Ark of the Covenant.\"\r\n\r\nMe - \"Hmmm, I'll
    do some sketching.\"\r\n\r\nI ended up basing a lot of the glyphs on ancient Sumerian,
    though no attempt was made to keep the same meaning.\r\n\r\nHere's my source material:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AlexSources_3591.png]\r\n\r\nYou
    can see I've traced over it in red.\r\n\r\nA lot of these glyphs ended up not
    being used.\r\n\r\nHere the font is in very early development:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AlexanderSpecimen01_5330.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    font is far from done, but I've sent it off to the client to ask if they find
    the letterforms acceptable, and would like to get some opinions of it here as
    well.  \r\n\r\nMy main concern is that it is still far to radical, and perhaps,
    well, embarrassing to the client, even though this was what I thought they were
    asking for.  I suppose what I'm really asking here is how to give this font more
    legitimacy."

  body: "OK - Serious critique - from an amateur.\r\n\r\nSince you didn't mention
    what your client wants to use it for, I'll guess that it's intended as a display
    font for headings or titles or posters. But even then, it should satisfy some
    basic text criteria for readability.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't satisfy your client's stated
    objective:  The individual glyphs convey neither a modern look nor an 'ancient
    cyrillicl (whatever THAT is)' feel.  It is not a font, but a collection of arbitrary
    symbols with no unifying concept or shape. There is no typographical or visual
    consistency. Some letters are triangular, some have random curves, and some are
    perfectly round. The variations, along with unexpected descenders (like the m
    and n) cause a disturbing and distracting optical unevenness to lines of type.
    The strange tails on the f, y, and g look like an attempt to make it look like
    handwriting. The unbalanced 'a' makes my eye want to complete it. The 'u' looks
    like someone trying to 'walk like egyptian'. The serif on the small eye, along
    with the hollow tittle, makes it look like an afterthought.\r\n\r\nI also find
    the overall color disturbing - the balance of black and white, the size of the
    glyphs, the closeness of the lines, the letterspacing, all contribute.\r\n\r\nI
    didn't start out intending to be cruel, but I'm afraid I have been. I just stated
    what I see. Hopefully, others will see the typeface's more redeeming qualities.\r\n\r\n

  body: "Couple of thoughts (and forgive please my 'Latin American english') : \r\n\r\nIt
    is an experimental font and I won't comment on the letters structures. This sort
    of radical design try to break with conventions and if this is one of the aims,
    we should not criticize things like poor legibility, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat I find problematic
    are the drawings. I would classify this font as what once (I think) G. Noordzijd
    described as 'spaghetti letters' pointing to the almost zero apparent contrast.
    But as such the font fails in being consistent with its own morphologic rules.
    Also the strokes lack fluency and beauty. \r\n\r\nYou can break typographic rules,
    but if you just ignore them, the results are always doomed. One important rule
    is that typography is a idealized, conceptualized, abstracted form of writing.
    \r\nI order to build an interesting design you must understand the behaviour of
    the tools that defined our letter forms (or at least to have enough knowledge
    of type history to be able to create new, interesting alphabets).\r\n\r\nIf I
    were you, I would first experiment with a rounded and thick tip: a speedball nib,
    for example. Then I would look close to the curves and endings trying to assimilate
    the generative rules behind the ductus and features.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing good typefaces
    with a similar kind of contrast is also a necessary step to understand optical
    corrections. They are unavoidable in fonts which attempt to follow geometric principles.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck.\r\n\r\nR. "

  body: ">Ain't the \"white\" in type a 'byproduct' to the reader?\r\n\r\nSurprisingly
    to me, I think perhaps yes. Eye tracking studies seem to show that the important
    parts of letters for recognition are the black bits. For example that readers
    differentiate a 'c' from an 'o' by focussing on the black areas (the right side
    of the 'o' and the terminals of the 'c') rather than paying any attention to the
    white gap between the terminals of a 'c'. At least that's what Karin von Ompteda's
    research seemed to suggest at Typo London last October, as the hotspots were only
    on the strokes, not the whites. When I asked her about that, she wasn't in the
    least surprised that readers' eyes don't see the white spaces, though I was. "

    though I think Vem (Ernestine's Armenian) is something to be at least mildly proud
    of, it's certainly true that I'm too ponderous. On the other hand it takes time
    to fully wrap one's head around something that virtually nobody has really done
    yet, and I don't want to simply imitate Bloemsma's genius; I actually had an epiphany
    of sorts in April, but it will take time to implement. Also, on the way home from
    Yerevan-Istanbul-Reading I finally figured out how an ideal \"Italic\" for Armenian
    could be built (not painted, mind you) and it might also serve to breathe new
    life into Latin Italics, which to me have historically been, and remain, a joke.
    That won't take nearly as long to implement - I've been drawing pretty intently
    for the past 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nMost of all though everybody's different, and to
    me continuously refining an established model (nevermind that it's a lousy one)
