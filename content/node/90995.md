    \r\n\r\nSo I'm digging through lists, and the one I've found so far is a team
    from Macau named after Stephenson Blake's Windsor: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Arch_Ka_I"

  body: I mean, is it really fair to say those teams were named after fonts?  Those
    words are associated with other things besides fonts.  Now, if we could find one

    \r\n\r\nUhm, I think it is the other way around. They typefaces are named after
    the cities."

    has a choice.
