    used for?

  body: "Hi Sandro\r\n\r\nYes, I too am proud to be a Neutraphile. You can find the
    original source <a/href=\"http://www.neutra.org/index.html\">right here.</a>\r\n\r\nWouldn't
    it be cool if you could buy the typeface there too?\r\n\r\nThe good people at
    House Industries recently sent me their current lovely poster which of course,
    has samples of Neutraface. I assume you know all about <a/href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18\">their
    site.</a> \r\n\r\nTaschen have a lovely and enormous hardback book \u2013 a monograph
    about Neutra himself and I think the lettering features in the book, but I'm not
    sure. There is also the <a/href=\"http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/books/architecture/all/facts/03650.htm\">paperback.</a>\r\n\r\nAnd
    finally you could try looking at <a/href=\"http://www.houseandgarden.com\"> House
    & Garden magazine</a> because I think Neutraface got used for their big redesign
    \u2013 again I don't know who did this work or how recently, but the type sure
    looks nice."

  body: I believe Amtrak/Acela have used it in some of their ad campaigns but I can't
    find it on their site or in their store. I could be wrong. I think Neutra is very
    appropriate for vintage travel related design and used it myself in a book about
    Luxury Ocean Liners.

    is the Schwab Poster by the Designer Michael Schwab. I dont know if he sells this
    font. I think he is the only one who has got the rights for this font!? When you
    take a look at his portfolio you will see that he uses this font for almost everything.
    But i like his style a lot."

    of his lettering on some of these. Cheater!
