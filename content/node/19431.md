body: "I am struggling with the uppercase in this slab serif. But the lowercase has
  been refined the most. Check out the oblique lower case. The body is messed up due
  to fontographer not publishing my kerning pairs.\r\nI was influenced by Nevelle
  Brody's Insignia, a little bit of Gill Sans, and a hint of Herbert Bayer's universal
  alphabet.\r\nAny feedback would be helpful.\r\nThank you,\r\nTerrance[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wholeset.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/caps1.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/caps2.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/caps3.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/oblique.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/body.png]"

  body: "I like it alot! Could become a nice display font. \r\nBut you have done some
    essential mistakes with your horizontal and vertical thickness and with your circled
    letters! \r\n\r\nRead this before you go on:\r\nhttp://kleindaten.de/kaech/\r\n\r\nSo
    when you go change your O C G Q, make them look more like perfect circled letters.
    The S doesnt work. And cut off the bend of the f\r\n\r\n\r\nBye: Steven"

    body: "Thanks Steven.\r\nI have been reading about optics. It's challenging. Do
      you think the lc needs to have more optic work done to it? And do you think
      I should draw the cap s, more organically, or build it from the other geometric
      parts?\r\nThanks again.\r\nTerrance"

  body: "Lc and uc needs more work with it! \r\nAnd not only the S have to be more
    organically.\r\nNot every lc needs descenders. I think O G Q D U S I dont need
    descenders! Shorten the descenders of the lcs a bit that lc and uc descenders
    dont collide when they are standing side by side.\r\nTry to make old-style figure
    numerals."

    body: I like old-style numerals, but Im not sure they would fit with the design.
      I have a lot of work to do now. I am also going to do weight experiments and
      refine the armatures.

  body: I like the oblique and the roman lower case. To me the f, k, t have to be
    review.

  body: I really like the form of the k. I would retain the idea behind it just make
    it rounder that it could stand next to an o for example

    body: "Are you talking about the lc k or the UP k? I have been reading about optics,
      and reviewed the article you suggested. It helped a lot. So, now, I have to
      make optical adjustments to the majority of the characters. It is exam week
      for me, so I won't be able to work on it for a while. Work coming soon!\r\nThank
      you"
