  body: "Are .fnt fonts with vector or bezier curve outlines or bit map descriptions?\r\n\r\nTrueType
    TTF fonts only support outlines, and do not support bit map descriptions.\r\n\r\nIf
    rhe .fnt fonts have bit map descriptions, there is no inexpensive way to convert
    them to TrueType TTF fonts. Rather, a talented graphic artist and type designer
    must create outlines which match the bit map descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe cost of
    this kind of font conversion depends upon the experience and pricing structure
    of the graphic artist and type designer.\r\n\r\nI estimate that the cost per font
    will be about $2,000 per font, or a flat amount for many such fonts, as low as
    $500 to $750 per font, depending upon the number of fonts, and their resolution.
    If anyone quotes you much less, become very wary and expect to receive inferior
    workmanship."

    what kind of fnt files they. Is there a way to determine if a fnt is a vector

  body: "Here's a link to the format details from Microsoft:\r\n[[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/65123]]\r\nThat
    will help you figure out what's in the font, if you open it up in a hex editor.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's a Windows pre-3.1 font, I think most of those were bitmap, in which case
    you're out of luck, but there were vector printer fonts also. I don't know of
    a converter for those, but it seems like something that ought to exist somewhere.
    If it's something else like a device font, I'd guess you should probably go to
    the vendor that produced it and see if they can convert it for you."

  body: "You don't want to edit it with a hex editor; it's just a way to check the
    file format, by looking at the location where the relevant information is stored
    (the 68th byte, it looks like). But on reading that page again, I realize that
    the FontFmt.exe tool probably tells you that. However, not having any *.fnt files
    to try it out on, I don't really know.\r\n\r\nIf *.fnt fonts still work on Windows,
    there's an easier way to guess whether it's bitmap or vector. Just install the
    font and try it out. If it looks horrible when used at an odd prime-number size
    like 17 points, it's probably bitmap."

  body: ".bmap files are most likely old (pre-OS X) Macintosh resource-fork bitmap
    fonts. If the goal is still to \"convert\" to TTF, gohebrew's original advice
    on converting to TTF outlines still applies*: there is no inexpensive way to convert
    bitmap/raster data into scalable outlines; at least not a way that will yield
    acceptable results.\r\n\r\n\r\n*One point to clarify though: it *is* actually
    possible to include (\"embed\") bitmap data in a TTF file. This is frequently
    done as a sort of cheap replacement for high-quality, manual TrueType hinting.
    Bitmaps in TTFs are usually provided as a supplement to outline data that doesn't
    render well at small sizes. However, it is possible to build a \"bitmap-only\"
    TTF, i.e. with only embedded bitmaps and no outline data. Not all operating systems
    and applications can make use of these effectively, though, and even those that
    can may encounter some problems. Bitmap-only TTF should not be viewed as anything
    more than a temporary solution."

  body: "If the resource fork is intact, yes, OS X should be able to read the files,
    though I don't think it actually makes use of them as installed fonts, unless
    combined with the corresponding PostScript Type 1 file (this is the old way that
    PostScript Type 1 outline fonts were supported under pre-OS X Mac). The old ResEdit
    utility, running under Classic, should be able to read them (and edit...sort of,
    though it usually mangles some contents; and it does not do any kind of conversion
    to other formats). Many font-editing applications can also read them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    if the files have ever been stored on a filesystem that is not aware of resource
    forks (that is: nearly every non-Macintosh file system), or compressed/archived
    using a method that does not preserve resource forks (tar, rar, gzip, non-OS X
    zip), then the files will be useless since all of the useful information is included
    there."
