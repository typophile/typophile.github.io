  on Hahnemuhle German Etching Black 600gsm.\r\nThe Projekt logo was 'double-bumped',
  that is, I stripped the rest of the plate off the base and ran the cards through
  the press a second time. The Heidelberg's spot perfect registration allows for this
  kind of extra hit. Few other letterpress machines can match the Windmill!\r\n\r\nI
  generally discourage trying to print on black, since most inks really can't cover
  and there's no brilliance to the resulting impression.\r\nRelief printing with opaque
  colors on a dark ground can produce very beautiful and subtle effects, but people
  all seem to want something that looks like it popped right off their laptop screen.
  Bright colors reversed out of black gloss... Hey, no problem there, but, uh, this
  is letterpress, eh? It was obsolete back when computers were still the size of a
  room.\r\n\r\nHowever, I had been experimenting with a giant can of silver letterpress
  ink (bought for an earlier project, I explained that on white paper it would just
  look like a lustrous grey), and found that this ink was incredibly opaque. So when
  Sean sent his design, which was white and grey on black, I suggested we try the
  silver with a double-bump on the logo. I think it worked very well!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PC160084_3_6615.jpg]\r\n\r\nslowprint.com
