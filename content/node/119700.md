  style--without the hand-done quality? My client likes this exact style a lot but
  does not like the \"deconstruction\". \r\nUnfortunately I need the \"F\" and the
  \"h\" to be very similar to this style, and I cannot for the life of me seem to
  find one. Either the swash is too swashy, or not swashy enough. Or the chancery
  style is not there. Poetica is close, but not similar enough for the client. Part
  of my trouble is many \"F\"s begin to look like \"J\"s when swashes are involved.\r\n\r\nMANY
  MANY THANKS  in advance!"

    could be altered (F):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/medici-script/\r\n\r\nSame
    with Le Griffe:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/le-griffe-2/\r\n\r\nBut
    if your client is insistent on Captain Quill, just smoother, then Nick's suggestion
    is the only way to go. Use the smoothing tool on an outline version of the glyphs."
