  body: "I found out (by watching it this morning) that the TV-series Frasier has
    a simmilar font in the black inbetween screens. I have no image of it and I have
    seen the character N only so short that I was not able to determine if it was
    the font I was looking for. Before my TV-network put on the commercials at the
    end of the show I have seen a glimps of the credits and that looked the same,
    but slightly more 'ellegant' than the one I need...\r\nAll help is still welcome."

  body: "So the Frasier (Korinna) font does not match. Still no luck for me... (thanks
    anyhow)\r\n\r\nNo-Matches so far: Benguiat, Elysium, Korinna and Priori.\r\n\r\nIf
    someone knows a font that has everything matching except for the N than I settle
    for that (and rebuild the N myself...)\r\n"
