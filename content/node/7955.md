  body: I can&#39;t seem to find this one, but it has a simular feel to Doodlebug
    from Letraset shown here in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script14Pg10.html"
    target="_blank">Part 14 of the Script Font ID Guide</a>. There are many other
    candidates here too, for &#39;dirty&#39; fonts. <BR> <BR>Another, that may not
    be shown there is Linotype&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/russisch-brot/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=60&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=DIRTY"
    target="_blank">&#39;Russisch Brot&#39;</a>, which has increasing degrees of crumbiness.
    <BR> <BR>Of course, the big point to realize is that your sample has been styled
    to add colors and shadows. You&#39;d have to play around with the effects to get
    the right look. Fonts don&#39;t come &#39;out of the box&#39; like that.
