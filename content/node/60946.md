  body: "First, PLEASE use a more unique title for your posts. A title like this is
    impossible to separate from the dozens like it. \"Deco NISI UT ALIQ\" would have
    been a distinctive title we could find again, if we saw an answer for it three
    days from now.\r\n\r\nNext, my answer is that I searched every Deco font at MyFonts
    (1045 fonts), and nothing is very close. Since these letters are nothing but semicircles,
    rectangles, triangles and lines you should be able to draw them easier than find
    a font, which may not exist anyway (if this is custom lettering).\r\n\r\n- Mike
