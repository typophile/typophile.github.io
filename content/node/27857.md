body: "Ive just started doing some design work for the bar I work at. Im creating
  my own drink menu, having already done some other designs for a lunch menu and magazine
  advertising. \r\n\r\nSo Im sort of hazy as to finding a concept or relation to text
  and food, or related feelings evoked. . . Make any sense?\r\n\r\nI want the drink
  menu to stand out in design, coming across as modern yet elegant. I want the drink
  descriptions to appear appetizing and inviting so much so that pictures are hardly
  neccessary. \r\n\r\nAnyone with any thought or experience on the matter, Id love
  to hear from you.\r\n\r\nLike someone who calls the radio station, first time poster,
  long time reader. . . I look forward to hearing from you. \r\n\r\nIll post some
  working images shortly\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

  body: You could start by showing us the logo of the bar. I wouldn't suggest straying
    too far from the style the logo sets forth unless you have a concept to back it
    up.
