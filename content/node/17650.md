  body: "Hi Paul,\r\n\r\nNo contextual OpenType? Are you working on that? Your EULA
    is a bit sparse - does your defintion of \"use\" allow someone to merge the different
    styles, draw additional glyphs and make their own OpenType version?\r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si"

    or one of the games groups might be interested in an contextual OpenType version,
    they like this sort of thing. ;-)"

  body: "Thank you for the posting Paul. And thank you for the questions SI?\r\n\r\nOpentype:
    Yes. We plan on releasing all of our fonts as Opentype Pro versions eventually,
    with contextual alternates. We've been focusing on trying to develop glyphs that
    work on their own, as I believe that the lack of regulating characters is the
    reason why most previous graffiti-based typefaces have not been successful. Thats
    the long answer though, and a bit of an excuse. I either need to to (a) learn
    some simple opentype code or (b) find someone else to do it. But it is a must
    to have it done eventually.\r\n\r\nAs for the sparse EULA: thank you for drawing
    my attention to that broken link. You can find our EULA here: http://handselecta.com/fonts_eula.html\r\n\r\nBasically
    you can modify for your own purposes but cannot rename, redistribute, sell or
    give away the font you modified. The license is the same and copyright remains
    with us. But if you do any modification, please let me know. I'd love to see what
    you've got in mind.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. If you have any more specific questions
    drop me a line.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nChristian\r\n"
