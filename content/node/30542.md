  we were not able to identify the font by ourselves \r\nand are seeking your help.If
  you might be able to suggest some \r\nsimilar versions we would also be more than
  happy.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

    are all close, including DeVinne, which was what Century was based upon, but I
    haven't seen any that are exactly the same. We don't know if the sample we are
    shown are metal, or digital, or how old they are. Both of these families have
    been produced in a host of versions, but using the sc, italics and the numerals
    hasn't helped to isolate one from the sources I can find. If this is from a European
    foundry that none of us has information about we can look until we go blind, and
    never exactly match it. \r\n\r\nYou may just have to pick the closest digital
    font you can find. We have given you some suggestions.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "<em>We don\u2019t know if the sample we are shown are metal, or digital,
    or how old they are</em>\r\nYes, we do. Or at least I can guess from both the
    language and the printing that this book is from the beginning of the previous
    century, i.e. between 1900 and 1930. Max Planck published his first major paper
    in 1900, and the text refers to one of Planck\u2019s discoveries concerning radiation.
    That\u2019s why <em>Alt Latein</em> is a good guess. German scientific publishers
    were very conservative typographically. \r\n\r\nEvery foundry had a face like
    that, even before ATF Century (1904). As they were all more or less copies of
    each other, you\u2019d have to look at a lot of old specimens to find the exact
    font. The book was probably set in Linotype or Intertype, but it could have been
    Monotype because of the amount of formulars involved. Mono wasn\u2019t very widespread
    in Germany, but when it came to that type of setting, no other system was as flexible.
    \r\n\r\nFinding the exact face wouldn\u2019t do you any good, as you\u2019d want
    to set the book today, and presumably not in hot metal."

    digital versions will never be 100% identical. These people are looking to create

  body: This looks like Monotype hot metal typesetting. If my memory serves me more
    or less well, this specimen is Modern 189. Conor's call is a good one because
    the Linotype version it really quite similar. Hopefully no need to digitise :)

  body: "Looks most like Monotype Modern Extended (as suggested by Erik), of which
    it seems there were several iterations and lots of size variants (again see Erik
    above). I have had a look at <em>Book Types from Clowes</em> and it seems identical
    to Monotype Modern Extended No 1 except for the unique letter 'f'. \r\n\r\nHere's
    a theory (maybe nonsense): \r\n\r\nIs it possible that German type needs a narrower
    'f' because the next letter is very often 'u umlaut' (in the word 'f\xFCr' which
    I would guess is the most common word that uses the letter 'f' in German and would
    give a rather unpleasant yet very common 'f\xFC' pair\u2014see illustration below\u2014with
    a standard English 'f'). Hence a 'German' Modern (if well-crafted) will be slightly
    different (i.e. narrower) in the 'f' department? Anyone ever thought about an
    fudiesesis ligature for the  word 'f\xFCr'?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fur_5339.gif]\r\n\r\n
    Finally, what about the pointy italic 'v', that's got to be a 'nu' hasn't it?
    Every Modern I can find has curvy  italic 'v'.\r\n\r\nGreat type though. Whatever
    it is."
