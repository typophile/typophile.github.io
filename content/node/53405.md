  question if I may - seeing as you're the font guru and alll.. somehow I've had a
  font disappear off my pc... It is \"FrutigerSCINRmv1Roman\" - I think it's an adobe
  font, which came with my CS3 web premium. Do you know how/where i could get it from
  again?\r\n\r\nMy response:\r\n\r\n<cite>the easiest thing to do would be to check
  the CS3 disc for it. if that does not work (i can't see it with the CS3 package
  i have - design premium) maybe check any other software you have installed (like
  MS Office etc) to see if it came with that.\r\n\r\n<cite>I'm guessing you didn't
  keep a backup for your HD or fonts folder?\r\n\r\n<cite>if all else fails there
  are a few places you can buy it legally like:\r\n<cite>like: http://new.myfonts.com/search/frutiger/fonts/\r\n\r\n<cite>also
  i've posted your question on Typophile to see if anyone else has an idea.\r\n\r\ndoes
  anyone have any other ideas?"

    that this is some sort of customized version of Frutiger with a modified name.
    I would think about whether the company I worked for or some client had initials
    like \"SCINRm\" or something.\r\n\r\nAnd in any case, I can promise you it did
    not come with any version of Adobe's Creative Suite.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
