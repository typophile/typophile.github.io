  body: "It's questions like this that make me wish font sites would let you search
    for the italic forms of serif or sans fonts. Then when you use \"newstext serif
    italic\" all you would see are the italics from serif fonts that could be categorized
    as 'newstext' styles.\r\n\r\nTHAT would be really useful! <em>(Hint to FontShop
    or MyFonts site developers)</em>\r\n\r\nIf I had all the time in the world I would
    make an Italics Font ID Guide, but I can't keep up with what I have now.\r\n\r\n-
