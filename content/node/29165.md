    so horrifying - is this really something the BBC is using? It looks squooshed
    and badly hand drawn to me.

  body: "Whew, thanks for the reply, was beginning to think no one was talking to
    me!\r\n\r\nYeah, sorry about the grab. After I posted it I realised it was still
    anamorphic and so will look a bit squashed in horizontally. I've attached another
    one.\r\n\r\nAny ideas anyone? Along Frank Lloyd Wright lines I guess...\r\n\r\nPlease?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/babylon2_4007.jpg]"

  body: I'm still gonna bet it's custom for that series - it looks clumsy to me, especially
    those B's.

  body: "Thanks Mike - garbardine is pretty close in places, though the G is very
    different (NB, rather helpfully I haven't posted a sample containing the G, stupid
    me!)\r\n\r\nIt's not vital I get it exact at the moment but it's really bugging
    me. There must be something quite close?!\r\n\r\nTrue, could be a custom, but
    just suprises me that they'd go to that much trouble. They've used the same font
    for all the credits so it isn't like they've just modded the letters for BABYLON.\r\n\r\nIf
    no one has any luck tonight, I'll post a better grab with bigger selection of
    letters tomorrow.\r\n\r\nCheers guys,\r\n\r\n- Terry"

    a few more letters on there.\r\n\r\nGuys - I've been loitering around here for
    the last few years and I'm really surprised this has got people stumped!\r\n\r\nPlease,
    anyone?!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/babylon3_6132.jpg]"

  body: "That's the closest yet, but this one is making me nuts!  There is something
    disturbingly familiar, but I don't know if it's because I've actually seen it
    somewhere, or it reminds me of other things, like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-rennie-mackintosh/\">Rennie
    Mackintosh</a>.\r\n\r\nI started thinking that if this is a commercial font it
    has to be from somewhere relatively obscure, and so I look at FontHaus -- no joy--
    , and then I hunted through the old Precision Type Catalog through the forgotten
    foundries they used to sell -- nothing there either.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to
    me whether this high-waisted, draftsman lettering style, is supposed to be Art
    Nouveau, Craftsman, or Art Deco, but it's definitely old. The Frank Lloyd Wright
    fonts that P22 sells are sort of this vintage, but no matches.\r\n\r\nI have a
    feeling that this is an existing font, but maybe from a very old (defunct) digital
    source.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hey Terry. I don't know if this comes too late, but there is an old Letraset
    face \u2013 Vienna Extended \xA91989 Antony De Meester \u2013 which matches the
    structure of what you show above, although the B is different. The A is a dead
    ringer. Possibly there was a regular width Vienna that may come closer, or the
    job for the BBC was altered by hand as others are suggesting. Linotype have Vienna

    <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/interdimentional.font?nb_ppp=50&text=BABYLON\">Interdimentional</a>
    is based on over at Dafont.\r\n\r\nCheers for all your help on this guys. I was
    working on a pitch in connection with this project and ended up using Interdimentional
    - I just modified the letters that didn't match.\r\n\r\nThankfully you'll all
    be glad to hear the pitch was successful and on receiving the assets to start
    the project I can now announce the winner is....\r\n\r\na custom build (hats off
    to Patty and Tiffany)\r\n\r\nI'm sure I've seen it somewhere before but all the
    evidence in the font points to it being put together for this programme.\r\n\r\nOnce
    again, many thanks for your suggestions.\r\nTerry"
