  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everyone, I've been working on this logo for an estage agent company. I posted this the other day: 
http://typophile.com/node/45780 and have made some changes and added some other ideas, I would be very grateful to see what anyone thinks. I really like the idea of just having a 'R' and degree symbol, but havn't really been able to make it work yet.
Any feedback would be very much appreciated,

		<div class="commentbody">top right and bottom middle are the best to me

Top Right:

my only worry is that the partially rounded trend might date this design as time goes on, but on the other hand, maybe it will becme more popular before it subsides:

/me recalls the stupid 'techno' and 'matrix' styled designs from a few years ago with cut-off corners and concentric circles

Bottom Middle:

Simple, clean, effective.  It feels a touch empty or weak, but maybe it just needs more time to grow on me.  I think this i the best or has the most potential of all of them!

Hope that helped!</div>

The cityscape in #7 won't read well at small sizes.

What about making a keyhole that is also a thermometer to indicate "red hot?" Hmmm or maybe not, it's been a long day at work, so I can't tell how bad my ideas are at this point haha.

I do, however, really like the idea of the keyhole representing the "R" but I agree with Scott Leyes that they are a little past their hey-day.</div>

I'm seeing Museo everywhere, and it looks good. I like the bottom middle the most as well. The top right looks good as well, but there's not much reason for the box around it, maybe a different shape?</div>

Maybe the 'R' isn't strong enough...
I've been drawing custom letter R's but haven't come up with anthing I like
Any body got any suggestions for other type to use?

		<div class="commentbody">Not really type suggestions, but the word RED has much tighter kerning than HOT. I'd even them out. The first and last R° may be placed in the middle of their frames, but optically, I think they could be nudged towards the top. The space between the cap height and frame edge look a little big to me. You could try tweaking the type logo yourself (removing some of the curved ends while keeping others?) to fit your needs...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">agreed, the R's lok centred mechanically, not optically.  human brains are silly things but in the horizontal alignment they look fine!

I say the first two hold the most potential, the last one seems weaker and less direct.

I played a little bit with the overlay here, I think you have a great thing going on, but for the overall shape of the mark, I'd seriously consider borrowing centuries of aesthetic development and make the overall shape of the thing more like the inverted profile of a princess cut diamond. It's sure to work well ad take the guesswork out out of the sizes.

here's your logo:

Here's a shape I'd love to see your logo fit inside, just to see if it improves it:

I've altered it abit to fit in the shape you suggested innovati, what do you think?

I'm not sure the client is particularly liking it, don't think they got the idea, but I've gone this far with it, may aswell see it through to a conclusion...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/redhotlogo_3446.jpg]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A few points and suggestions:

1) I'm not inherently against using an initial as the basis of a mark, but in your current configuration, I don't think the logo is functioning well for these reasons:

Because both the R in the title and the R in the mark use the same typeface, the mark becomes superfluous. It seems like overkill - like I'm seeing the logo twice, especially because there's not really any separation or differentiation between the mark and the title. I would suggest using a different typeface for one of the components, or just integrating your idea into the title, as shown below. If you went that route, you could use the standalone R as an alternate logo.

2) It is possible people won't get the thermometer symbolism, so why not embrace your idea more literally? Perhaps stylize the R more like a thermometer, or scrap the R all together, and create some type of real estate/thermometer symbol, something like what I've shown below.

Good luck.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rh_01_4954.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/rh_02_5361.jpg]</div>
