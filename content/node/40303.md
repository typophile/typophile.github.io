    glyphs the  Postscript Type 1 version doesn't, and it'll be a lot easier to access
    the sophisticated typographic features, which you'd have to insert manually with
    Type 1.

    difficult to know, because the previews on itcfonts.com and fonts.com don't seem

    I would recommend the OpenType version of any font, because small caps, ligs,
    figures, and alternates are indeed much easier to use in that format. But <em><a

    comparable. [[Carter and Cone]] have not released an OT version of ITC Galliard
    CC, but you could contact them or FontShop to create one for you.\r\n"

    I'm primarily going to be using Photoshop and Illustrator... I'm guessing I'd

    is one of the many reasons OpenType was developed.

    I just tested using the font Mr Eaves. In order to write 'tricky' with the funky

    '5' being the character that represents 'cky' in the ligature keymapping.\r\n\r\nAm

    OpenType. There are a number of characters available in the C&C fonts that likely
    (i.e., weren't in the past) available in the ITC fonts, like tabular old-style
    numbers. Also, there is a \"Swedish\" version available from C&C that has  lower-case
    \"f\" which works better with umlaut-accented vowels.\r\n\r\nI don't think C&C
    would object to your making an OpenType version of Galliard for your own use --
    That would be worth checking. If you don't try to go hog-wild with the features,
    it is pretty easy, and in passing, you can include some kerning pairs not in any
    of the Galliards available.\r\n\r\nC&C Galliard is available only in roman & italic;
    for the bolds & blacks you have to buy ITC fonts. But the roman & italic cover
    the text, and that's where the refinements of C&C Galliard really show.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "<cite>Cos that\u2019s still ITC... but from what I gather that version is
    the most extensive in terms of characters. Am I right?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, yes,
    and no. I don't know the exact timeline of Galliard; Carter may have cut it when
    still working for Linotype. At some point, it got sold to ITC, and at that point,
    ITC owned the name. This has happened to more than one type designer . . . Sumner
    Stone cut at least part of the \"Stone\" clan when working for Adobe. It got sold
    (\"licensed\") to ITC. When Stone started up his own foundry, he had to pay ITC
    for the right to offer his own fonts -- which he did, refining them some in the
    Stone foundry version.\r\n\r\nAnybody who releases an ITC font is suppose to stick
    pretty much to the same font. The trick here is the \"pretty much.\" I liken it
    to the notion that if the font was used in printing newspapers, then if you changed
    from one foundry to another for an ITC font, you shouldn't have to change your
    settings in the composition program (size, kerning, etc.) and most of your readers
    wouldn't notice the difference.\r\n\r\nBut most of us frequenting this site aren't
    printing newspapers, and we like to think our use of type is a little better than
    with newspapers, and our audiences a little more attuned to detail.\r\n\r\nSo,
    in my somewhat less than humble opinion, the C&C versions of ITC Galliard are
    a little more refined than the Bitstream (also a Carter company). He fixed some
    things that bothered him. The kerning is a little more refined too, but a user
    of type always has to do his/her own tinkering with the kerning. It is the letterforms
    themselves that are better with C&C.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that even the C&C Galliard
    was rendered before direct-to-plate printing, and some feel the balance of the
    letterforms is a bit off, a bit <cite>thin</cite> when printed CTP. But I doubt
    Carter will refine Galliard yet again, so the C&C version is probably the last
    version we'll get.\r\n\r\nIt is still a wonderful font if you pay attention to
    the setting size; has great balance when you get the size just right.\r\n\r\nWhenever
    I buy one of Matthew Carter's fonts nowadays, I always call Cherie Cone first.
    I figure they make a little more money with no intermediary. \r\n\r\nFWIW"

    paid thousands for this CD is shocked to find just how many text families in OpenType
    actually offer nothing new for their glyphs versus the PS1 format. \r\n\r\nWe
    all understand the licensing problem, but that was not the point for customers
    who, unable to research precise glyph coverage for each of 2,300 fonts, feel victimized.
    Perhaps because of our widely-read discussion of this discrepancy, Adobe sales
    copy now says \"most\" but not all fonts offer extended glyphs, a helpful qualification.
    But I also made many constructive suggestions about addressing the glyph shortfall
    family by family, creative collaborations with license-owners that would have
    demonstrated Adobe's leadership instead of their current passive indifference
    to their customers' needs. Now that ITC has released their enhanced OpenType Galliard,
    perhaps they are ready to re-license it to Adobe so Adobe can replace their now
