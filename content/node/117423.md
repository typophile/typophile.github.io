  caps for acronyms longer than three letters arise?\r\n\r\nIf you are using the obsolescent
  tradition of writing full stops after the inital letters in acronyms, why is it
  that there are no spaces after the stop, just like there are after the initals in
  a shortened name?\r\n\r\nShould those spaces, in both cases (acronyms and personal
  names), be non-breaking or of some other kind?"

  body: I can't tell you when this practice began, but note that many typographers
    and/or editors don't put spaces in names like W.B. Yeats either.

  body: "The answers to the \uFB01rst and last of these questions is in the style
    guides used by editors. Firstly, one would have to compare different editions
    of style guides to see when the conventions changed. And thirdly, today if one
    wishes to be proper and demonstrably correct, then one should choose and abide
    by a style guide (there are different ones available, with different \u201Crules\u201D,
    e.g. for American English and English English (fewer marks).\r\n\r\nHowever, \u201Cwhy\u201D
    is open to conjecture. Note that long ago compositors placed no space after a
    comma, which might suggest a visual reason for the lack of spaces in acronyms,
    even those unwieldy conglomerations that cannot be sounded like words."
