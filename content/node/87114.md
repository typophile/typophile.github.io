body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to identify a feature that I've seen before,
  although I'm not sure what it's called or where it comes from. In a small-caps face
  with a larger, initial cap, I've sometimes seen the small-cap \"L\" be extended
  to reach up to the larger, initial cap-height.\r\n\r\nThe only example I've been
  able to find is the type for the Disney movie Mulan, although I know I've seen it
  elsewhere:\r\n\r\nhttp://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwNjY4NDU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM0OTUyMQ@@._V1._SY317_CR4,0,214,317_.jpg\r\n\r\nAttached
  is an image of a logotype I'm working on that uses this feature as well.\r\n\r\nIn
  this case, I feel like it makes the Trajan feel less stodgy and uniform. It gives
  it a quirkiness which I like, the same quirkiness you get with a unicase. It echoes
  themes of elevation in the identity, and mimics growing trees in the mark (not shown).\r\n\r\nIs
  there a name for this? Does anyone have other examples? Is there a history behind
  this?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks John, you're right. It makes me wonder even more if there is a name
    for this character and what the history is behind it.
