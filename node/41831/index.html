  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Anybody know a Bremer Presse font with the alternative &ldquo;r&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo;? I was reading about Blumenthal&rsquo;s font Spiral (Later Emerson with monotype) which, before Monotype sold it, had an r with a short arm and another with a long arm. But in the book it mentions that Blumenthal was very influenced by ideas about paper and type that were in vogue at the Bremer Presse. And that the Bremer Presse had a font with the alternative &ldquo;r&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo;. The book is called &ldquo;American Proprietary Typefaces&rdquo;, and the section was written by Jerry Kelly. Actually if anybody has info on how to contact him that would be great too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As far as I know, no one has made a digital version of the Bremer Presse type designed by the printer publisher Will Wiegand. If someone has, I think I might prefer not to know about it, because I quite like the idea of private press typefaces remaining what they were &ndash; the exclusive working tools of the people who made them or commissioned them to be used in very particular ways in specific books.</p>
<p>I have a couple of Bremer Presse books, though, Eben, and have scanned the 1922 12pt roman, which includes the variants to which you refer. I had not noticed this feature of the types before, so thank you for drawing my attenion to it. Interestingly, only the 12pt has them: the 1924 11pt does not.</p>
<p>The differences between the variants are quite subtle. I&rsquo;m afraid I would need longer to track down examples of the individual variants in use, so we could determine in what contexts they were used.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Bremer12_3906.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the earlier, 1913 16pt there are variants for a f i and t, but not for r. The variant i is particularly interesting: the difference is in the size of the dot, and I&rsquo;m guessing that one is for use after the non-ligating f.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Bremer16_6743.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are also similar variants in the eccentric Bremer Presse Greek type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks very much! This is terrific.</p>
<p>These examples are quite wonderful. What I am struck by is the multiple t glyphs with their various cross bar lengths. They make a great deal of sense to me. I agree the double i makes sense as well in the context you mention. As do the double f&rsquo;s and perhaps especially the a&rsquo;s. The a corresponds very nicely to what I have seen H. Zapf do in his calligraphy, and 15th century scribes do as well.</p>
<p>In the book I mentioned above it was stated that the long r in Spiral was supposed to be set to make an over-lose justified line set better. The example I saw didn&rsquo;t suggest that to me at all. Instead they seemed to use the long r as a calligrapher would; setting it at the end of words. The short one was used next to other letters on the right. John, have you see the seen the book I an talking about? If not, would like to see the Spiral?</p>
<p>I have requested the book shown in the sample ( RW Emerson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nature&rdquo;) but I don&rsquo;t know yet if I get get it.</p>
<p>Interestingly Erik S talked about the utility of the ck &amp; ch glyphs shown in the same here. Also there are two kinds of them. That have to be for a reason. I would like to see why they are so useful in general and why they would require two kinds. Maybe it was for cultural/linguistic reasons rather than optical ones. At the moment I don&rsquo;t have enough insight into that.</p>
<p>It niggles at me that “American Proprietary Typefaces” is very clear about a second e but none is here. Could this be an incomplete showing? Or an early one; prior to the second e? Could there be another Bremer Presse type font/face with that feature?</p>
<p>It would be great if somebody would quote us a title so we could get ahold of it and see this face at work. Maybe we could get Dan to find one in Germany or Paul to dig one up at Reading&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I just meant, with such subtle differences in the letterforms on these metal types, it would be very difficult to know which i is which when putting the sorts back in the case (assuming that you would want to file the one kind of i in one box and the other in another). But then I thought it&rsquo;d be practical to have some marking on the type body itself &ndash; a nick, or hole, or painted side, or engraved symbol or the like &ndash; that would aid this process.</div>

<p>The two Bremer Presse volumes I have, one about the press and one publication of the press, are <em>Die Bremer Presse: Königin der deutchen Privatpressen,</em> 1964, and <em>Albii Tibulli: Elegiae</em> 1920. The latter is set in the 16pt type, with elegant initial letters and titles by Anna Simons, who did a lot of work for the Bremer Presse.</p>
<p>A quick perusal of the latter book indicates that the variants of i were, in fact, interspered freely, and not used contextually. It would be interesting to compare this setting with earlier use of the type, including initial specimens if available, to see whether the different i characters were originally contextually selected. Maybe they were, and Wiegand later decided that it wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble.</p>

And if they didn&rsquo;t take the precaution Craig imagined then they might easily have been mixed.</p>
<p><cite> Might this have been a kind of compensation for the improved consistency in the casting technology? </cite> I don&rsquo;t think that was the idea.

<p>William Dana Orcutt, discussing the design of his Humanistic type in <em>In quest of the perfect book,</em> writes &lsquo;I decided to introduce the innovation of having several characters for certain letters that repeated most frequently, in order to preserve the individuality of the hand lettering, and still keep my design within the rigid limitations of type&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m not sure when the Humanistic type was first used, but Pankow&rsquo;s <em>Proprietary American Typefaces</em> shows a setting from 1906. Here is a sample from Orcutt&rsquo;s book:</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The Gutenberg 42-line Bible also shows evidence, as explained by Hermann Zapf, of variant letters as an aid to justification: letters of different width are used to maintain consistent letter and word spacing. Zapf had the idea to do the same thing dynamically, by intelligently scaling glyphs horizontally without distorting them or changing stem weights. This was implemented by URW as part of the Hz text layout engine, but not currently active in any shipping software, so far as I am aware.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I got a xeroxed copy of the setting Of Emerson&rsquo;s Nature with Spiral yesterday. Absolutely contrary to what was stated in APT the use of the long &ldquo;r&rdquo; is exclusively at the end of words. The short r is used inside words. What I am not seeing is the long &amp; short &ldquo;r&rdquo; used to help justify a line. It&rsquo;s use might be different later but this was it&rsquo;s fist use and I think the full measure of zeal and intention in it&rsquo;s use by Blumenthal is likeliest here. Moreover it works extremely well which is gratifying to me because my theory of contextual shapes ( and scribal tradition ) predicts this use rather than the use suggested by APT.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Agreed. And I think that&rsquo;s why with narrower spacing more standard you see the narrower type of r become dominant in the 20th century. Of course if you take this too far the r ends up too narrow and it&rsquo;s saliency is reduced. I have seen some fonts where this is clearly a problem. Also how you space the letters will determine the ideal shape of the arm of the r. Unfortunately there is no script to let the arm shirk or expand with setting. But clearly a wider setting would make a wider arm feel better or more acceptable. Also when you have an r at the end of the word there cannot be too much white space because there is no next letter, and the full sized arm on the r looks and reads the best I think. That is what I think the example of Spiral above shows.</div>

<p>I have to assume that you&rsquo;ve never heard of Jost Hochuli or seen the amazing <a href="http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=P0026">book of his work.</a>  In this book are examples of type specimens he designed (I think for phototype machines?) using the technique you describe—they are really beautiful.

<p>Good point. Type terminology is massively arbitrary much of the time.</p>

The Bremer Presse by design restricted the number of Fonts they used. A Folio page (Bible, Tacitus) could take a day to set, and these were the most skilled typesetters in their Time.
The BP was a private Press in the true sense of the word, as it was not a commercial enterprise, if you look at the Cranach press and how financially draining it was on Kessler, you get an idea about the BP.  Fritz Krinitz (Frieda Thiersch und ihre Handbuchbinderei) worked with Frida Thiersch at the BP.</div>
