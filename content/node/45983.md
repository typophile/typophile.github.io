body: This beautiful typeface was used in the signage & accompanying brochure for
  the exhibition [[http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/figuration|"Figuration
  in Contemporary Design"]] at the Art Institute of Chicago. Photography was sternly
  discouraged, but an understanding security guard allowed me a couple furtive shots
  of the typography. Any help identifying this lovely font? Thanks very much!

    capitals similar to this. Especially the \u2018venetian e\u2019 looks out of place.\r\nThis
    should be rather easy to pin down, but I have no idea.\r\nF"

  body: "This is a new one to me. The 's' is very odd, with two kinds of serifs. Swash
    Romans are pretty rare too, and none that I know of match this. \r\n\r\nThe closest
    I can think of is Thierry Puyfoulhoux's large and varied [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/presencetypo/classica/|Classica]]
    family which includes a Gallic version with the Venetian style e, and the Prestige
    subfamily that has all kinds of swashes and ligatures.  There is a swash W like
    the one shown, only it is reversed.\r\n\r\nThis might be another time when writing
    to the Museum might get an answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "If you have the brochure, did you try using the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]] with samples of the letters? There were not enough upper case
    letters in the other samples posted so far to get a good set for the Guide. You
    would also have a clearer look at the lower case letters, and maybe I picked the
    wrong shapes for my searches.\r\n\r\nThe Museum query may or may not ever get
    an answer. The last one took three days.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    from Psy/Ops, designed by Rodrigo X Cavazos and G\xE1bor K\xF3thay. It has all

    the Swash Roman and Titling Roman. And I especially remember that beautiful ampersand
    on the Swash Roman...I didn't get a photo but it was the loveliest thing.\r\n\r\nVery
    impressive, thank you so much for solving the mystery! Cheers!\r\n\r\n- Angela"

  body: When I saw this I thought of Aquamarine, which I have almost licensed a few
    times. Strangely, it's no longer on the PsyOps site. The only thing there now
    is the [[http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_aquafancy.html|Aquamarine Titling Set]].
    I didn't think to check FontShop, good call. I wonder why it's no longer available
    direct from PsyOps...

    on the site by searching for \"Aquamarine & Cavazos\".  You're right though, they
    do not sell it directly any more. I'm guessing that their Type1 prices would have
    undercut the new OpenType version sold at FontShop.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
