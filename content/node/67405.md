  small restaurant opening in my neighborhood soon. I want it to look like the older
  hand painted gold leaf window signs-\r\n\r\nexamples:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gold_leaf_6250.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gulfstream_6636.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  need your help to find a proper typeface that is in the style I'm looking for here-
  So far I was thinking Interstate Condensed Bold:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mouton_4918.png]\r\n\r\nBut
  I'm really looking for something more maybe.. naive? more flawed possibly- something
  a little more hand painted and older looking."

    (\xABGegr: 1865\xBB) seems familiar, but I can't put my finger on it. Now I can't
    stop wondering. :-)"
