  body: As close as I can find is  Linefeed (Regular) from Typodermic. But it is only
    close.

  body: Linefeed from Typodermic is very similar to the Letter Gothic typestyle on
    Selectric typewriters. Both are monospaced, while the sample in question is not,
    so "only close" is right.

  body: Take a look at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/konstantynov/guarda-sans/|Guarda
    Sans]] from Andriy Konstantynov. Again, not an exact match, but pretty close in
    most regards, and is variable width.
