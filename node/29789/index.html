  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">All of this talk about the new Office fonts has me wondering, if I have Office Pro 2003 on my PC, does the license allow me to put it's fonts on my Mac? My feeling says NO, but my want for Font Bureau typefaces on my Mac says YES.

Someone please say yes?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You'll have to read the EULA specific to the fonts in question, but:

1) Mac OS X (at least from v 10.3 on up) can use PC Truetype and Opentype fonts without reformatting. I think PC PostScript fonts work too, but I'm not sure.

2) Windows XP (and consequently most compatible software) can run on Mac hardware, either with Virtual PC on PowerPC models, or with Boot Camp on the newer MacIntel models.

So, if you have your software all installed on the same machine, you should be allowed to use all your fonts on that machine, even if they are used between multiple operating systems, unless the font's EULA specifically or implicitly excludes this sort of use.

		<div class="commentbody">Here are the applicable sections of the Office Pro 2003 EULA. Sections 13 and 14 mean that I would have to remove the software entirely from my PC and install it entirely on my Mac. BUT! Section 1.1(B) clearly must apply to my laptop, regardless of OS. What other kind of portable device is there that can install the software? Only a laptop.

So I can have my cake and eat it too! Californian FB and High Tower Text will fit in nicely with my other fonts on my Powerbook :)

The text weight of Californian FB Version 1.0 that comes with Office 2003 does include 387 glyphs with small caps and oldsyle figures, so you must be mistaken. I also checked it out in InDesign. It works.

LTC Californian looks good also. I only ment to say it was better in comparison the the Berkeleley Oldstyle that is more common.</div>

That sounds like it's okay then, (to use the fonts on the Mac). I mean, Windows is *always* running somewhere isn't it?;)

These publisher fonts were the last MS released that work on the Mac and Windows "equally", so I'm not surprised people want 'em. 

"High Tower is Hoefler’s version of Jenson"      :-o Say what!?

Unfortunately, when those FB fonts were distributed for Publisher (a long time ago as you'll see), there were no tools for making OT tables and there were no applications that supported features, so we were only able to make sure the glyphs were there to do a few nice things, but not all of them. We cooked the ingredients, MS set the tables. </div>

But the typeface is mighty fine, just the same. It's a little slower using since I have to set glyphs by hand if I want the extras, but I like it nonetheless.

So am I clear that I can't add OT tables to them? Not even for educational use? I think under Fair Use laws I can almost get away with anything as a student. Legally.

But does it actually matter? I'm not reselling or redistributing, just modifying for my own use. Like Bringhurst recommends :)</div>

Still, you could argue that FB (or MS) could lose out on the potential revenue from the sale of a (hypothetical) OT version of Californian. Weak?

Fair use and interoperability provisions may come in to all this as well, but a Google search reveals these points to be fairly moot, at least in the U.S. You can also Google "contracts of adhesion" if you're in to it!

Any one else care to argue?</div>
