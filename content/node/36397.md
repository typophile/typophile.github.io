body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI was looking through W Magazine yesterday, and could't quite pin
  the serif font. It looks like Garamond, but isn't identical to the version I have,
  which is Adobe Garamond. Does anyone know which version is it \u2013 or what it
  is - if it isn't Garamond. It looks somewhat more modern than Adobe Garamond. Maybe
  it's just the negative kerning?\r\n\r\nSee the sample at: http://www.fredafashion.com/images/press/download/w_cover.jpg
  or\r\nhttp://www.skydance.com/movies/flyboys/images/news/David-Ellison-W-Magazine.jpg\r\n\r\n(The
  sans font is Hubert Joachim's New Hune found at http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/NewJune/
  \ and the serif is custom from Joshua Darden http://www.joshuadarden.com/custom/behind_wmagazine.php
