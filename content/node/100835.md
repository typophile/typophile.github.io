  excellent way to learn and achieve good spacing in your own fonts. Based on this,
  what do you guys think are fonts with flawless letter spacing?\r\n\r\nThanks for
  the suggestions!"

  body: Thanks for the link! Nevertheless, only one or two fonts are recommended,
    so I'm still looking for good candidates.

    matter of personal taste, not to mention highly dependent on the situation.\r\n\r\nI
    truly do not understand why the Western world insists on proportional fonts and
    kerning tables, when East Asia seems to get along quite happily with its characters
    fitting neatly into uniform cells. (Korea's variation on this is kind of cool,
    I think: each <em>syllable</em> fits into a cell, and the letters within that
    syllable are squished to fit.) But then, I seem to expect different things of
    characters than other people do. When I see a number like 21500 appear proportionally
    spaced, I want to say to the left-hand digits, \"Get in your cells and stay there!
    Only the thousands' digit should be in the space for the thousands' digit! The
    ten-thousands' digit has its own space!\" Similarly with words: sometimes I see
    the letters all mashed together. Hey folks, you're not exactly writing on goatskin:
    you can <em>afford</em> not to smoosh the letters together!\r\n\r\nI leave you
    with a sin: monospaced text figures (from eulerarchive.com).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/euler_3874.png]"

    for OS nums being fixed-width, I actually think they look better that way than
