<div class=commentbody>Matha, Paul, <br>thank you for the GREAT explanations and info! I would have not imagined, having not read Heller's book, that he would have "attacked" a casual use of the Swastika. The only thing that stops me from being too blatant is my respect for Hebrew people and culture. <br>But again, I will concentrate more on the blackletter in my future project, so people will have less to complain. <br> <br>BTW, Hrant, you know that John Downer may have a point on Steven Heller?

<div class=commentbody>I'm sorry, Matha, but in my case it's just respect. Which I always have in front of death and suffering caused by people. <br> <br>And Hrant, well, you know that our view on the Emigre library is quite the opposite than yours. And I'm still surprised you like Democratica and Ottomat. Maybe because you know Miles and me? No, I don't belive so. Maybe because the conceptual framework of Democratica (on the disbading of the Soviet Union) was really close to your experience. And maybe because my Ottomat (Tomazooma) was indirectly an homage on the American indian tribes. <br>But both these things do not show graphically in our types... <br> <br>Amyway you've an odd perception of what Emigre actually represented and of its importance. It's not surely the recennt Tarzana that has fostered what has come later. <br>May I ask you when and how you first came in contact with Emigre? <br>Also, say what you want, but Ottomat was influenced heavily by Triplex and Triplex Italic, after Gill and Futura/Semplicit</div>

<div class=commentbody>Of course, I was just saying I have additonal respect in this particular instance. <br>The tricky matter with history is to work on it leaving apart prejudices. A lot of historians "demonized" the figure of Adolf Hitler without any information on his formation (sorry for the pun) and life events. <br> <br>I've recently bought the book "Adolf Hitler: Eine politische Biographie" by Rainer Zitelmann in its italian edition and I think is the most honest and balanced analysis on him to date. <br>Different times, different places, but similar unfortunate events could contribute negatively to a personality (as Hitler) as well as a positive one. I'm thinking about the incredible series of bad luck and misfortunes passed by Abraham Lincoln before becoming Presidents of the US at the age of 51. <br>This "parallel of sorts" occurred to me reading a book on self-esteem by David Brooks and Rex Dalby, always in italian edition. <br> <br>The problem is the lack of information available on the childhood/teenage years/young age of Hitler. If you read Zitelmann's and some parts of the Mein Kampf you can see how much many decisions of Hitler came out of frustration and despair, although Hitler does not admit it. <br> <br>If Hitler had met a sensitive and good hearted person or friend (or more) in his Vienna years we could have ended up having a painting artist instead of a self-destructing dictator.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This post has taken about seven tangents. A few points I'll <br>add to the array of topics: <br> <br>The Swastika vs. Blackletter: <br>I think the separation between the two is easy for me, but <br>perhaps, maybe not for people who lived it. Our cultural <br>experiences shape our understandings. See my next point. <br> <br>Blackletter: <br>If I compile all the usage of blackletter I've seen in my <br>lifetime (outside of history books) growing up in Southern <br>California, I associate blackletter with newspapers and <br>Mexican groups. (At least, in San Diego, where I grew up, <br>most of the Hispanics are Mexicans. I'll apologize now if <br>other Hispanic groups in the US use it). At least in Southern <br>California Latinos own blackletter, and therefore, that's my <br>association to it as well. <br> <br>The UN Logo: <br>What the wheat? Surely he's not talking about the hammer <br>and sickle?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the separation can certainly be useful [for helping out blackletter], it's just a bit devious to pretend they're not related. <br> <br>BTW, your Latino-Blackletter connection is right on. And it seems to suffer almost no Nazi stigma for them. <br> <br>UN: he's talking about the Soviet "crest", the one with is the Hammer&Sickle overlaid on a globe, with wheat on the sides. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Here in British Columbia, there is a negligible latino presence, but a lot of German Mennonites. I tend to associate blackletter with them, since they still use it. Another instance without the Nazi stigma. <br> <br>Paul</div>

<div class=commentbody>>I think the separation can certainly be useful [for helping out blackletter], it's just a bit devious to pretend they're not related. <br>You've summarized the problem in treating the issue very good, Hrant. I'll keep the separation, as Butler suggested, and it will not be a project on the swastika. But the nazist swastika usage will be addressed in one way or the other. <br> <br>I don't share the fatalistic attitude towards history's inability to help reflections and understand past errors ("teaching lessons" is more pretentious). An example is Paul's assumption on the arab Israeli people. The preconceptions against islamic culture are not a byproduct of so-called "compassion" towards the hebrew one (compassion is hardly an excuse for another form of violence). The preconceptions against islam are constantly reinforced by its fanatic fringes (which, of course, does not represent the actual religious beliefs) and the fact that christianity (but mostly so-called "christianity" and occidental culture in general) fears Islam. To me, and I am catholic, this is senseless, but it's a pretty diffused fear (especially in the US). We should turn back this attitude against the american reaction to the terrorism also. I wrote a letter to a Senator and to the US President, from the Food First webpages, as Emigre talked about it, knowing perfectly that it wouldn't have served nothing. They went ahead with their "military systems". But I did. <br> <br>Anyway, I think it would be better to save further ideas for a specific thread, if you agree. We're straying a little off the path while I would concentrate more specifically on the issues connected to the blackletter usage as propaganda. We may do one when I will decide to work on this book project, if you like the idea. I would love to have the opinion of many designers. I just don't know when... <br> <br>If you wish to keep talking of the issue, please start a new thread, so people can notice it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Claudio, that sounds great. But John Butler is your man (and you should consider GMM too, for a well-educated Hispanic angle). I'm just a blackletter dilettante... unless of course you wanna bring in its <i>functional</i> advantages: <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_fraktur1.html target=_blank>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_fraktur1.html</a> <br>:-) <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you, John. In the future your forum will be a gem. Promised. <br> <br>Thanks, Hrant! Who is GMM? <br>The observations on your page are pertinent, but as you pointed out, the presence of archaic forms and an overtly decorative attitude often reduced the legibility of blackletters. Most roman fonts have an abundance of rounded shapes, many textura are too angular and so they present similar problems. Anyway cross-pollination between the two styles it's a great undiscovered territory. After all, blackletter calligraphy derived from the same roman forms as many unattractive latin faces of today.</div>
