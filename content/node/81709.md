  Dictionary of Unofficial English</cite></a> (it even has a quote from William Safire
  on the cover!). And it includes Hrant's famous \"bouma\", along with a quote from
  him as one of its seminal uses. \r\n\r\nI couldn't find any evidence that this news
  has been broken to Hrant and the rest of the Typophile community, so I thought I
  ought to make a topic."

  body: Nice! By the way, Peter Enneson tells me that in Dutch the "ou" in Bouma is
    pronounced as "ow" in "cow", not as "oo" in "boom". Does the dictionary indicate
    the pronunciation?

  body: "Yes, it's \"ow\". I used to pronounce it \"oo\" (even though I knew\r\nof
    the native pronunciation) but Peter eventually convinced me\r\nto use \"ow\" instead.
    For one thing it makes it sound fancier.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
