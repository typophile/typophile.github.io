body: "Hi Typophile\r\n\r\nThis is my first post so please be honest and don't hold
  back. I've been approached by a entrepreneur who is building s string of 24 hour
  gyms in the Berkshire area for 18 plus the audience is for people who are your average
  Jo looking to get fit, to your pro weekend warrior who are fed up with high gym
  prices. The only terms were that it should look professional, clean, simple, bright
  and bold, oh and it must use florescent pink, blue, or green. \r\n\r\nSo I did my
  research and looked at competitors as one does and then I started sketching he liked
  the concepts but couldn't settle on one of them so he enlisted the help from another
  designer who would design it his way, after going through 9 iterations I did for
  him. Now I'm not saying my designs look amazing because they don't, they could do
  with a lot of work, critique and tweeking and the right font for starters, which
  I'm hoping I can get from here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/XrdmaVa\">My
  initial design 1</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/Pe5PB7K\">Design from another
  graphic designer </a>\r\n\r\nAfter the other design I wanted to simplify it and
  use fonts that would be right for the audience, the more I look at it though the
  more I think the logo should be on one line.\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/VcNAvje\">My
  counter design</a>\r\n\r\nWhat do you think Typophile? If anyone has any critique,
  advice etc please let me know.  The client has settled on pink and not using bevel
  now and understands why we need to make the logo simpler. \r\n\r\nThank you \r\nRegards\r\nBapps\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    feminine. \r\n\r\nTo be honest none of the designs really stand out to me, partly
    because the logo is so generic. There's nothing about it that says \"gym\" to
    me."

  body: What's going to say "gym" though? Human bodies and lifting weights. It's so
    cliche that it might be a good idea to do something you might consider more generic,
    yet captivating. That sideways "s" might be a good start. I would try different
    shapes behind NU, different typefaces and definitely different colors if it's
    a unisex gym.

    Source]] makes their initials into a stylized barbell (although their name at
    the bottom is careless and generic).\r\n\r\nMaybe you could extend the sides of
    the <strong>U</strong> above the cap height and add dumbbell-shaped serifs. (Don't
    use a barbell. If you close the top it will read as NO GYM.)"

  body: "I agree that weights, etc. are often used in gym logos, but this is a common
    problem in logo design. How do you design a logo without duplicating other logos?\r\n\r\nWith
    millions of logos in existence, it's hard to come up with anything that hasn't
    been used before, but you try to put a different twist on it, make it unique in
    some way."

  body: I get the impression of a mobile app that allows you to communicate with other
    people who like the gym. The aesthetic is a bit dated too.

  body: "Pink is not a thoughtful choice for a mixed gym. Also, I would explore more
    appropriate fonts (these are too rigid for the purpose).\r\n\r\nIntegrating gym
    gear (dumbells or whatever) in the logo will look tacky. Besides many people who
    join a gym do it for using the treadmills, cross trainers or spinning classes.
    The macho image of dumbells may also give women a wrong impression of the gym
    identity. Is this a gym where people go to stay fit and healthy, or a \"no pain
    no gain\" bunker for hillbillies?\r\n\r\nI would keep the overall thing clean,
    simple and dynamic. And pink, seriously. If it was an exclusive gym on say Miami
    South Beach, the kind with a vallet, maybe some pink would work. Otherwise, it
    will probably look cheap. As it does now.\r\n\r\nKeep it simple:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen-Shot-2012-01-03-at-12_4648.09.41-PM.png]"
