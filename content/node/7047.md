body: Hey All, I am looking for a cool script font, as used commonly in Evel Knievel,
  Daredevil, Stuntman style posters. Have tried all the common scripts, but nothing
  has quite the punch &amp; uniqeness here, I admit some tooling and alterations of
  existing fonts may be required. Quite like the sharp ends, very sharp points of
  each letter, K is very cool. Thanx All, back soon.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/50724.jpg"
