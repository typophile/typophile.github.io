    \ a non-digitized version that may be closer in some respects, but also has differences
    from the image. Erbar Grotesk Extra Garnitur. Ludwig & Mayer Frankfurt 1927\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ErbarGrotesGarnitur1927SM_6158.jpg]\r\nSo
    what else was available when the card was printed. Approximate year?\r\nDon"

  body: "Looking in Jaspert again, I think this is Semplicita, an Italian sans from
    1931. It has the straight-sided U, and the stemless a and d. Canada Type has a
    version called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/semplicita-pro/?refby=bowfin|Semplicita
    Pro]].\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It seems that Durotype also has a version of Semplicita they call [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/simplo/?refby=bowfin|Simplo]],
    and it has the same f as the original that goes below the baseline. The CanadaType
    version has a more conventional f that stops on the baseline.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks Don!\r\nThat Ludwig & Mayer is a beauty.\r\n\r\n& thanks again, Mike!\r\nSemplicita
    it is. That Jaspert sounds like an amazing resource. I may have to invest in a
    copy so I can stop bothering you! Any particular edition you'd recommend?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You're welcome Daniel. Jaspert is the best reference, together with McGrew's
    book, for 20th century metal typefaces. Last edition was _The encyclopaedia of
    type faces [1970]_ by W. Pincus Jaspert, W. Turner Berry, A.F. Johnson. Publisher
    London: Blandford Press, [4th ed., entirely restyled and greatly enl.]  \txiii,
    420 p. ; 31 cm ISBN 0 7137 0191 9 Out of print, but try Ebay. Might be expensive.
    Should be in major university libraries as Z250 .J36 1970  or very similar.  \r\nThanks
    Mike for finding Semplicita -- I know from experience that it's time consuming
    to go through Jaspert to find a font because there is no detailed classification
    index -- also thanks for the heads up on the CT and Durotype versions.\r\nDon\r\n"
