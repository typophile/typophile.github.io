  and have scrolled through various selections trying to indentify this font but have
  had no luck! I thought it was Daisy Lau but there is a slight variation and the
  \"h\" is very different.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any insight as to
  the font name.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nEric [img:sites/default/files/old-images/header_5104.jpg]"

    correct. Almost! \r\n\r\nIf anyone else would like to give it a shot, please feel
    free. I am at my wits end trying to match it. "

  body: Hey darkchild. The FontShop page that Akira linked shows every glyph in the
    font, including that alternate 'h' and 'f'. Just click those letters in the Character
    Set to see the alternates.
