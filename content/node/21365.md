  to Rockwell and Stymie, that it was the precursor to them, but have not seen it
  anywhere.\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone have any info on Venus, such as designer, date
  of release, ect.\r\n\r\nThanks, Chuck"

    someone else will know.\r\n\r\n<a/href=\"http://www.ftbauer.com/bswebs.G3?log%3Apkid=2&log%3Acompany=22&log%3Acontract=1&log%3Aserviceid=1&xtd%3Alanguage=es&pkid=2&idcompany=22&idcontract=1&idservice=1&language=es&behaviour=PRODUCT&menukeys=TYPES_BUSCADOR&buscador=venus\">Venus</a>
    is an older grotesk from Bauer, I think, maybe contemporary to Akzidenz Grotesk,
    Standard and Basic Commercial. It is in Jaspert's Encyclopedia of Typefaces and
    also Rookledge's TypeFinder, so there is a known date of release for it. Not too
    sure about the designer though."
