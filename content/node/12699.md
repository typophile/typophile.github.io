  and GSSong needed for a book, but neither will load either into suitcase or fontbook.
  \r\nApparently, they are Postscript type 1 outline fonts, in LWFN format? Cannot
  import them into any type of readable document. I don't believe they are corrupt,
  but yet i cannot access them. Assuming they may be old and useless, I looked online
  to purchase these fonts elsewhere, but they are elusive. I'm stuck. Can anyone help?
  \r\n\r\nthanks\r\ne"

  body: "Usually the problem with Chinese fonts is the encoding, wich is different
    if you're using fonts for the Hong Kong/Taiwan market or the mainland China one,
    and it can get quite nasty with old font files.\r\n\r\nDid you try to put the
    font file directly into the system fonts folder? Since it's only two of them it
    shouldn't slow down too much your machine's performances and you can remove them
    when you're done with the book.\r\n\r\nSong is one of the system fonts that come
    with OSX, so you could install the additional asian fonts package from the installation
    disk, but I don't know how you're going to make color separation so it might not
    be a good idea to use system fonts.\r\n\r\nI hope it helps,\r\nJacopo"
