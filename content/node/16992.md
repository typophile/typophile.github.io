  if I make an etiquette goof at any point. I did search this without any really relevant
  results, so I thought I'd give it a try.\r\n\r\nTwo related things I'm curious about:\r\n\r\nObviously
  we've all seen a gazillion typefaces that include a leaf character, even ones that
  don't include a lot of ornaments. Is there some particular reason why they're so
  ubiquitous? \r\n\r\nAnybody have a particular favorite leaf ornament? I'd like to
  collect some good ones.\r\n\r\nthanks."

    like type, aren't they: a flat, discrete, high-contrast shape, that naturally
    comes in a huge variety of shapes and \"styles\", so a fertile genre for developing
    matching ornaments for any typeface. That's what I found, anyway.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Leaves.jpg]"

  body: "My theory is that the humble Section mark (\xA7) in many typefaces suggests
    a leaf. The resemblance is even stronger in type designs that rotate the symbol
    90\xB0, such as in Oz Cooper's original design for his eponympous face."
