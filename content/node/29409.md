  been able to turn up as yet.  I'd love to find the font used on the Sokol Blosser
  winery's Evolution No. 9.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to a pic:\r\n\r\nhttp://sokolblosser.com/images/image_library/Evolution-bottle_349.jpg\r\n\r\nI'd
  apparently make a reasonably lousy private (or public, for that matter) detective
  as repeated attempts at locating this rogue typeface have turned up snake eyes.
  \ Welcome any guidance any of you may have.  Thanks!"

    is similar:\r\nhttp://fontbureau.com/fonts/AntiqueCondensed\r\n\r\nRed Rooster's
    Grand Canyon has the outlined/shadow options:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/grand-canyon-rr/\r\n\r\nFYI,
    you'll get faster/greater response if you post these kinds of requests on the
    Type ID board."

  body: Reminds me of something from the Dover books. I thought it might be from <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/solotype/">Solotype</a>, but didn't find
    a match. For a similar look you  might try something from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/archivetype/">Archive
    Type</a>.
