body: i thought this would be the place to ask. anyone know of any brush scripts similar
  in style to the logos for www.timhortons.com or www.hm.com? I'm looking mainly for
  high contrast between thick and thin strokes as if painted with a broad, flat brush.
  anyone know of anything?

    in a lot less time.

    href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html\" target=\"new\">Script

    be in Part 4. You might find something that fits what you are after in those pages.
    Fonts from <a href=\"http://artandsignstudio.com/fonts.html\" target=\"new\">Art
    & Sign (Signfonts.com)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.signdna.com/v2/index.php\"

    hand-lettered script font styles. (Use the Script Font Reference List to look
    up the suppliers.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The earliest group of the SignDNA fonts do look like digitizations of some
    photo-lettering scripts, but there are many others too. In some cases the reason
    they look familiar is that the lettering was done by men who did lettering for
    the photo type companies, or who have done lettering commercially for years. I
    also think it is fair to say that there is/was a certain 'commercial sign script
    style' that was widely used, in which legibility was more important than individual
    style, and where stroke thickness and slant were the main parameters for variation.
    Look through the Solotype Catalog pp.88 - 106, if you want to see what I mean.\r\n\r\n-
