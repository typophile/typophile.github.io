  first time.\r\nFabulous site made even more so by everyone's input...\r\n\r\nIf
  possible any ideas for the main font used in the newspaper title 'news of the world'...
  could be hand drawn but any similar fonts? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/News-Of-The-World-front-p-008_4600.jpg]\r\nThank
  you all in advance for your help! "

  body: "This (from Dan Solo: 100 Victorian Display Alphabets) looks pretty close.
    However, it has not yet been digitized.  There are many other Woodtype and Circus-style
    fonts that have a similar 'feel', some of which would need the outline ('rimmed'
    effect) added.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BurlesqueFromVictorian_4372.jpg]\r\n\r\n

  body: "Agreed Ryuk. I realize the  'e' 'f' amongst others are off but 'burlesque'
    \ isn't toooo wide of the mark. Just a first time poster getting over excited
    at a response to his question!  Thinking I may need to render by hand and then
    put in illustrator as the original font may well have never been digitized.\r\n\r\nThe
    two ball split serif of tuskcandy is helpful - thanks!"

    Obviously not identical, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/tuskcandy/|Tuskcandy]]
    shares some similarities though.
