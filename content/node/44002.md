body: "I'm looking at one typeface where the bold is 44% thinker in a vertical  stroke
  on an uppercase letter that the same stroke on the regular weight and another where
  the difference is 5%. At 5% of difference between the bold and regular, it's hard
  to tell they are different when they aren't next to each other.\r\n\r\nIs there
  a <em>normal</em> range of difference between a weight called \"regular\" and one
  called \"bold\"?\r\n\r\nthanks."

    extreme to me, not the average. I would say that one-and-a-half times the normal
    is probably closer to average.\r\n\r\nBut really, as you say, things vary dramatically.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "&emsp;Consider the [[http://scripts.sil.org/Gentium_basic|Gentium Basic]]
    font family: the \"Book\" weight is heavier than the regular, but in no wise as
    heavy as the \"Bold\u201D\u2014and then there's the \"Bold Book\" weight too.\r\n&emsp;(Actually,
    I've used the regular bold, scaled down, to get faked small-capitals.&ensp;The
    image below doesn't quite show how well it works; try it yourselves: Gentium Book
    Basic at 10pt with all-caps Gentium Basic Bold at 7.4pt for small-caps\u2014though
    the tracking may have to be played with for best effect.)\r\n\u2014Joel[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gentium

  body: "Joel, your constructed small caps are a bit heavier than would be done normally
    in a type design; the idea is for the small cap stem to closely match the lower
    case stem in weight. Where you could work from a 'semibold' your procedure would
    probably match better. \r\n\r\nIn Slimbach's seriffed faces generally have both
    a 'semi-bold' at the lower end of Briem's range, and a 'Bold' at the upper end.
    For example, Minion semibold is 36% larger than the regular, and the bold is 58%
    larger.  \r\n\r\n"

    tried it at a bunch of text sizes and can't actually get it to look right.&ensp;Oh,
    well.&ensp;According to [[http://scripts.sil.org/Gentium_status]], true small-caps

  body: For an example of bold that isn't bold enough, check out Tim Rolands' Envoy
    at MyFonts...that's my cautionary example for all type designers. If you can't
    tell weights apart at 8pt at the merest glance, you need to re-draft, as Rolands
    certainly should.

  body: "I got the \"double\" idea from Karow's book \"Typeface Statistics.\" But
    when a stat contradicts your prior knowledge, it's a good idea to look at it carefully.
    On further thought, I realize that this book looked at average stroke thickness
    for \"regular\" fonts and for \"bold\" fonts, but:\r\n\r\n-  those were not necessarily
    \"bold\" fonts that were style-linked to any regular (and vice versa)\r\n\r\n-
    sometimes a \"regular\" is style-linked to a \"semibold\" instead.\r\n\r\n- And
    who knows how many wacky display faces were in that sample?\r\n\r\nAnyway, Briem's
    advice seems fairly sound (as it usually is), for a bold that it style linked
    to a regular.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n\r\n"
