  at 8 rue Littr\xE9, 75006 Paris France, featuring one of my old free fonts: [[http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2585|Bolonewt]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/facade_small_4419.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flyer_verso_4616.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flyer_recto_6611.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
  works wonderfully on this shop sign, but Bolonewt is a font I made many years ago,
  and as proud as I was of it then, knowing what I've learned since then makes me
  think it looks like ass. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bolonewt2585_5196.big.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  curves don't blend into the straights right, and the \"s\" is frightening! So, I'm
  determined to fix it somehow.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Congratulations. Go and visit <a href="http://www.olivari.fr/"><strong>Olivari's
    site</strong></a>. The store looks really nice and in the <a href="http://www.olivari.fr/pano.html">panorama</a>,
    you can see your font on the back wall, above the shelves.

  body: "Sadly it appears Olivari's website is gone. I have no idea whether it's still
    in business, but five years is a long time for a small retailer, and many fail
    much more quickly than that.\r\n\r\nI wish I'd been able to get a screenshot of
    the interior panorama while I had the chance."

    site: http://www.dominiquemassot.fr/index.php. There is a copy of Olivari's site
    at the url http://www.dominiquemassot.fr/olivari_old/galerie.php (the shop closed
    in 2011). You can still make a virtual visit inside the shop.\r\n"
