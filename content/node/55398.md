body: I work for a university and I've been tasked with designing a logo for an annual
  lectureship series. The letters are B and C and the name of the thing is very long.
  I've put together 2 different font choices for the monogram and 2 different options
  for each. Any thoughts?

  body: Hmm .. my first impression was that of an acrobatic rock'n'roll or cheerleader
    stunts, followed by a sports team logo. I'm just not getting an academic lectureship
    feel from it at all. I think this is because the type is too heavy and interlocking
    pieces creating an unbalanced 3D effect.

  body: Yeah, the athletic thing is big issue on my end. They all look like something
    you might see on the front of a ballcap or side of a football helmet. The reason
    I have them interlocking like that is because of the wide open negative space
    the C leaves when paired with the busy B. Maybe the font choice could fix that.
    Thanks.

  body: Why do you think that you need a monogram at all? Why not simply use a nice
    text arrangement for the full name?

  body: They've asked for a "monogram-type" logo. I tried some other stuff with the
    initials but nothing really stuck. Again, the C throws the balance off.

  body: "Off the top of my head, have you tried putting the \"C\" to the right of
    the \"B\" \u2013 maybe connecting or overlapping, though maybe separately, pretty
    close to it? Depending on the lettershapes, the double right-facing round vs.
    the single left-facing round might make for some interesting white space tension
    in between the two.\r\nAlternately, would it be appropriate to consider working
    with lowercase \"b\"/\"c\"?\r\n\r\nI agree about the athletics impression your
    current design gives; I also think the interlocking may be too strong, or forced
    (and a bit mechanical). It looks like something that might hurt, and that's probably
    not very motivating for a lectureship series. :-)"

    That\u2019s just the context you\u2019re working in. Anyway, I think that you
    need to try some kind of compositions with letters of equal height. \r\n"
