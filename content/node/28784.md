  in InDesign, and all the other weights are looking fine. It has happened on a couple
  of projects.\r\n\r\n(Exempel is the word for Example in Swedish version of InDesign)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/regular_italic_5677.jpg]"

  body: "A font I created with FontLab 5.02.\r\n\r\nIn this case there is a regular
    weight and an italic. They both work perfectly on screen, and I\u2019ve made print
    proofs out of it.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s just the meny in InDesign that shows the regular
    weight like this.\r\n\r\nAnd it has happened on other fonts I made aswell.\r\nSo
    it\u2019s a technical FontLab-question I guess. "

  body: It looks like an encoding issue. Do the two fonts have the same settings in
    terms of glyphset, encoding, codepages, Unicode, etc.?
