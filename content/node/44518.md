  body: "Hello, from 7 years in (your postings) future.\r\n\r\nYEs, the Amarcord fonts
    was hand drawn, and, if since '08 you haven't found this, this might help.\r\n\r\nSomeone
    has built the font - several iterations, actually.\r\n\r\nHere's a link.\r\n\r\nhttps://darkvotum.wordpress.com/2014/11/19/improved-amarcord-font-fellini-movie-title-typography/\r\n\r\nI
    hope - either 'back then,' or now, you found what you need(ed).\r\n\r\nP.S., I'd
    love to know what ultimately happened."
