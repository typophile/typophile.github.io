Hopefully, this more fully clarifies the relationship between the two fields, and will help to direct your future researches on this topic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The answer is "No"...and here's why I say that.

Calligraphy comes from the greek word Kaligraphia, from the root words kallos and graphein. It can be literally translated as "beauty in writing".

Typography, also, comes from greek...from the root words typos and grapheia. It can be literally translated as "figure writing". However, this doesn't really give the whole effect, since the greek word typos also connotates a dent or impression made by striking one figure against another. It is appropriate for the concept of a printing press, where each glyph would strike the paper, not only leaving ink, but a minute indention into the paper.

Calligraphy does not follow any of the aforementioned traits of typography. Calligraphy, furthermore, is not required to concern itself with readability, consistency or reproduction. Typography, however, must take such things into consideration. Calligraphy is inconsistent in presentation and usage. Typography must be consistent. 

Elements of calligraphy can certainly be incorporated into typography, especially when talking about the aesthetics of glyphs.</div>

I'd treat lettering as a sub-discipline of calligraphy, and type design as a branch of both. I know that a book I have on lettering - a Dover edition, naturally - treats of both calligraphy and type design as well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, definitions are somewhat arbitrary, but as far as skills, there is a definite divide between writing and built up letters, whether on paper or in a font development program. Writing means the hand in motion with a tool, leaving a mark in a stroke. When you build up letters, main skill is in the eye, rather than the hand. 

In beautiful writing, it's both the eye and the hand. And as John Hudson has pointed out, it's really misleading to call what scribes did "calligraphy" as their top priority was not to be beautiful in an ornamental way, but to be readable. This is something like the distinction between text and display type. I read recently, for example, that even in the days of the scribes, a different person from the scribe who did the text would do decorative built-up initial letters and illumination for a book. 

There are now folks who do both built up letters and written letters for emotionally evocative display, as well as occasional display fonts. But it's more unusual for that person who does hand done custom display to also do text type. And if they do undertake it, they are aware that it involves different challenges. So I would say that functionally the more important distinctions are between writing and built up letters, and between text and display. 

And of course there is a lot of overlap because the practiced and artistic eye is involved in all of them. But to master all of them is very rare, with Hermann Zapf being a rare example who is a master of all aspects.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, I wonder how rare it really is.
I wouldn't put myself in the same class as Zapf, but I've done a bit of calligraphy.
Other type designers with calligraphy skills: Vasilyeva, Veljovich, Lester, Slimbach, Shaw.
Note that these are not "lettering artists who make script fonts", which would be more the Michael Clark métier.
I don't believe these categories (designer/calligrapher) are particularly precise or indicative of type, typography or layout quality, it's more a question of which direction you're coming from, and where your interests and aptitudes lie.
Others?

Surprisingly, Ale Paul is not AFAIK a calligrapher (although collaborator Angel Koziupa is)—which goes to show that as with most aspects of design, it's results that count, not how you get there.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, that's a good question, and I don't know how much overlap there is, but my impression is that it's a minority of designers of text type who are good calligraphers, and visa versa. I do think you'd concede that you can have the eye skills and not the hand skills. If I remember rightly Matthew Carter, for example, is not a calligrapher.

I think calligraphy skills such as you and the others you list have are an asset, because the tool does things for you that you might not otherwise do, which you can then take up and modify in vector form.  </div>

I am not a calligrapher, although I understand a lot about writing and occasionally make use of the same tools as part of a design process, because I do not possess the manual skills required. I'm a type designer, which means that I sometimes apply the same conceptual and aesthetic considerations in my work as a calligrapher does -- and sometimes different conceptual and aesthetic considerations --, but what I am making is a different kind of product, and I make it with a different set of skills.</div>

For example, I saw a Facebook exchange where a famous custom letterer was asked by his friend why they didn't ask him to be a speaker at a type design series. He said, "Possibly because I hate type." I think he experiences type as a straightjacket that would prevent him from realizing his work. He's never done a font.  </div>

Also, “Yeah, it's pity to say that graffiti is part of typography. Blackletter is part of callygraphy also. But, blackletter included in typography.”

Blackletter is a style of lettering, which can be executed with either type or calligraphy. Calligraphic blackletter and blackletter type are still two different things.</div>

William, do your research, they all had backgrounds with inky fingers... want me to go on with names because I could fill this whole comment block???????? I just put down some ones you might want to look up for next time. Do you need Hebraic calligraphers also :-)

As to the Facebook exchange... I am constantly chided by other calligraphers for designing "type" because the genre I chose "takes work away from them." Now that's a hoot. That is why they do not like it. That, and their inability to use it (type) appropriately.

But my impression is that most designers of text type today, Matthew Carter being a prime example, aren't masters of calligraphy. I didn't say I had done a survey, but that it was my personal impression. You are the first one to come on this thread who is a master calligrapher—and you do display type, I believe. That's the kind of thing which gives me the impression of the situation.

As an aside, he alluded to the fact that he could not do it, guess that is why he went to calligraphers to resurrect their work, i.e. Snell!

And the names that I gave you are well equipped to design text faces (they do and did), in fact better than the new crop of revisionists, as their work is distinct! Just because they are not designing variation-on-the-same old-theme sans does not lessen their work. I appreciate a thoughtful re-interpretation but how many do we need.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Michael, I don't know who you are arguing with, but it's not me. I never said that Carter was "the most significant...". The purpose of quotes is usually to quote somebody, and I didn't write that. 

And then there's your idea that I think that I'm "from whom all blessings flow." Um, that would be God. I may be confused, but one point I'm very clear on, and that's about about my not being God. I keep noticing every day that the world, including my world, has an alarming habit of doing stuff I don't want to happen. Hell, I'm grateful when people give me the time of day. And I didn't disparage any of the people you listed—of those whose work I know, I think they're great. I grant you that it's a longer list than just Zapf, whom I mentioned, but it's also not the majority of those designing text types today.

And I didn't disparage display type in the least. And I didn't disrespect anybody, including you, whose work I respect. 

So if you do a survey showing that I'm wrong about the majority of type designers working today, fine, I'll be glad to say my impression was mistaken. In the meanwhile, if you want to argue with some arrogant, know-it-all projection of everything you don't like, fine. Just do me a favor, and don't call it William, or Bill.</div>

Something in common: both calligraphy and typography could be considered agents of "page layout".
But typography tends to the grid, whereas calligraphy favors a more plastic matrix.
This piece involved a lot of trial and error.

And sorry, it was the way the statement was framed that got to me, almost like titling fonts are the bastard children of type. And Jeff's assumption that calligraphy does not have to be read is still p'ing me off this morning. 

Well put Nick (change plastic to fluid and I think you have a quote for the ages :-))... and I once read that Calligraphy is about fancy, type is about continuity. Reining in the fancy is the same for both tho, just less "fancy" to pull back in a more staid text face. But there is still massive concessions that have to be made about the smallest things.

Disallow? I'm just saying that letterforms can be executed with type or with calligraphy. I think it's true of at least most letterforms, just that some or more suited to one or the other mode of expression. 

Even calligraphic typefaces, and even ones done with awesome cool OpenType contextual whoziss, have to tame and regularize some aspects of the underlying calligraphy in the process of becoming a typeface.

I think that what this comes down to is that the definition of typography in my head has as part of it that it is done with type. If you prefer a more expansive and all-encompassing definition that includes calligraphy, that's fine. I think that regardless of what labels we apply, it is handy to both be able to refer to using each form separately, and to have a broader concept that includes both. (Letter arts?)

Most anything published in England in the middle 18th century will be in Caslon. The easiest thing to get hold of might be the specimen book of 1766 reprinted in Facsimile in the 1980 journal Printing History, with notes by James Mosley. 

Of course anything early in the original letter pressed foundry type will give you the real thing, and nothing else is quite the same. That being said, the Mosley book is really good. </div>

Not quite.

Bembo is based on a later typeface by Aldus, the one used in Pietro Bembo's <em>De Aetna</em>, for example. The <em>Hypnerotomachia</em> was an earlier Aldine typeface which has been used less frequently as the basis for modern typefaces - Monotype's Poliphilus is one of the few revivals of it.</div>

Quick checking shows that my memory indeed appears to be wrong; De Aetna is from 1495, Hypnerotomachia Poliphili from 1499.

An Atlas of Typeforms describes the development of the Aldine types this way: First, there was a typeface in which the lowercase resembled Jenson, but the uppercase was made less clashing. Then Griffo recut the lowercase - the result being the De Aetna type. And then the uppercase was changed again, leading to the type of the Hypnerotomachia.

And, in between, a smaller type size was cut, in a slightly different style, for <em>De Epidemia</em>.</div>

I think your dates are right, but the pedant in me cringes a bit at the language of this assertion, since "Bembo" the name for a typeface is really a 1929 invention of the Monotype Corporation. It's more precise (if a little unwieldy) to say this as "the typeface on which Bembo was based precedes Hypnerotomachia." </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Correct. So, if the students are truly looking for examples of <em>Bembo</em>, then you really want to find books from the early 20th century (of which there are plenty of examples).

If, instead, they are looking for examples of the types used by Aldus, cut by Francesco Griffo, and which served as models for the 20th-century Bembo — then yes, you want to pull copies of <em>De Aetna</em> and <em>Hypnerotomachia</em>.

This seems like an opportunity for them to clarify and possibly be educated.</div>

That's like asking whether handwriting is a branch of typography. There are typefaces that emulate calligraphy, just as there are typefaces that emulate the appearance of tire tracks. Automobiles aren't a branch of typography, either.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here's some food for thought:

One of my family members is an engineer. When I was younger, I used to browse through his reference books. One of them was a book on making engineering drawings. This was from the days before everything was done on a computer. The book had a whole chapter on lettering. It was <em>very</em> specific about what style of lettering was to be used. It even did the whole grid-circles-and-ovals thing.

It was essentially a typeface intended to be produced by hand.

My guess is that this discussion is not so much about the nature of a thing, as about the definition of a word: the word "typography", and maybe also the word "calligraphy". If typography is by definition strictly about letterforms produced by machine, and calligraphy strictly about letterforms produced by hand, then the answer to the original question is self-evident.

Here's some more food for thought:

I read somewhere that the traditional method for producing a Japanese font was for a calligrapher to write each character separately, and these handwritten characters (calligraphy) would <em>become</em> the font (typography).

Okay, maybe it's not so self-evident...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While it is true that type design should not limit itself to what can be achieved by traditional calligraphy, in one respect type design and calligraphy are inextricably connected.

The basic letterforms - or the characters, in a non-alphabetic writing system - are limited to what can be written by hand. A "writing system" composed of a repertoire of characters so complicated that they could only be uttered by a phototypesetter or a laser printer - which is the case for <em>some typefaces</em>, of course, but that is a property of the specific typeface and not of the basic character repertoire - would be of significantly limited utility.

And, thus, since type design translates to a printed form characters which were <em>originally designed to be written</em>, it's not surprising that writing remains influential.</div>

Yes, but people do so much less writing today and so much more typing that the influence now becomes only a historic one. I can see a time in a couple of generations when writing by hand will be almost unheard of in all but third world societies.  Handwriting will soon be a novelty.  Calligraphy will still survive in the same way that horseback riding survives, as an art form or recreation but not as a continuing dominant force.  The current generation of youth communicates with one thumb typing on a mobile device.  Imagine what the next generation will see?</div>

Not really. Consider this: you can draw a recognizable human face, but how the actual face itself looks has nothing to do with drawing. But drawing that realistically takes talent, skill and time - and that's the clue here: we should not insist that something intended to be read easily also be easy to write.

In fact theoretically there's nothing stopping us from having two alphabets: one for writing (which does have to be legible) and one for reading (which doesn't have to be writable in the least).

Yep, the New York Times had an article last year which said that many young people have difficulty reading cursive writing, since they encounter it so seldom.

I think cursive writing will largely disappear (except for artistic/decorative uses), but simple block lettering will remain useful for the forseeable future for things like writing short notes, making labels, etc.
