  for science and decided to add some to my latest font. I got a bit carried away
  and ended up adding all the Greek (monotonic) characters. I've no experience with
  Greek so was wondering how this looks. Any critique appreciated but specifically
  with regard to the Greek (I've included image of the Latin for comparison).\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\nDave\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Greeksans_5586.png]"
