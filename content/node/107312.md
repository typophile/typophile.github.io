  to Turnip for the body text. It''s mainly a print paper, but also gets put on the
  web. What would be a good pairing for headlines? (I''m currently using Chaparral
  for the body and Gibson semi-bold for headlines but would like to refresh the look.)
  Any advice would be greatly appreciated! '

    leaning towards using Salvo Sans - any thoughts?"

  body: "Hello! Good question. I used an early version of Turnip for a book, where
    I paired it with <a href=\"https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/balance\">FF Balance</a>
    (picture <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/5467938594/\">here</a>).
    That worked very well in terms of Balance echoing Turnip\u2019s chunkiness and
    warmth, but Balance is arguably more of a text face, and may look too weird up
    large. \r\nI would in any case not go with something that\u2019s too clean and
    mechanical; if you want a sans, Salvo looks like it may work well. Other chunky,
    warm, but not too soft sansserifs you might take a look at: <a href=\"https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/legato\">FF
    Legato</a>, maybe <a href=\"https://ourtype.com/#/try/pro-fonts/parry-grotesque/\">Parry
    Grotesque</a> \u2026 perhaps something like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/block-be/\">Block</a>
    but more contemporary? I keep thinking of this in-progress sans by Sindre Bremnes,
    used in the title <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/7900397770/in/set-72157620488846151/\">here</a>
    (not sure how finished it is)."
