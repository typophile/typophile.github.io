  body: "I'm surprised how few orders there seem to be. I had a bit of time on my
    hands so I went through my sales reports and chose two orders roughly 24 hours
    apart and worked out from the order numbers how many orders MyFonts takes in a
    day, divided it by 24 then 60 and found they get about 1.5 orders (paid or free)
    per minute. I had way too much time on my hands so I did the same thing with longer
    periods of time between orders - surprisingly the order counts remain pretty consistent
    - the daily average number of orders is about 2200.\r\n\r\nLooking at the map
    I guess about half of them are Museo ;)"
