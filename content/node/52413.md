body: I'm hoping to find a slab-seriffed face in the same vein as Knockout/Champion
  (i.e., with a variety of weights and widths and ideally just a bit of vintage character).
  Anyone know of such a rare creature?

    is a great suggestion too but I should've mentioned it's already been vetoed.
    \r\n\r\nAppreciate the input!"
