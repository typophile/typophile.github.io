  jpegs of the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and bill of rights.\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/slurp_file.php?fileref=2\">The
  Declaration of Independence</a> in particular is astounding, because once it was
  written and signed it was made into an engraving, which (being acid- and fade-proof)
  is still 100% readable. You can see where the scribe made a couple typos which were
  subsequently corrected. Of interest to me was the cursive long s and the interesting
  use of rules between sentences to aid justification... Finally it's great to imagine
  from the signatures the jealousy John Hancock inspired: I can just see Ben Franklin
  trying to copy his swash, then giving up with a half-hearted scribble."
