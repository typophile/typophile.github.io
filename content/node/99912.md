  body: "Looks like a modified version of Heinz' standard labeling font (proprietary).
    From the appearance of text on their labels, they may use two or more different
    fonts (all proprietary). One used on ketchup containers may be named TK-Super
    Duper BG2 Heinz.\r\nhttp://snackspot.org.uk/images/heinzBeansWithSausagesOld.jpg\r\n\r\n

  body: You're right - the lower case S, U, and C look almost exact; the A and E from
    something else entirely.

  body: "Hrant... the fact that corporations keep selling licenses of old fonts by
    defunct foundries, does not imply that the designers are getting paid. For example:
    http://typophile.com/node/91696\r\nIn many of similar cases, the \"Corporations\"
    are screwing the designers.\r\n\r\nThe original designer of Triplet is surely
    not making any money out of the Mt or Cg sales. So \"in this particular case\"
    I couldn't care less if they lose a sale of the Triplet license. (*Note that I've
    said \"In this particular case\", so please don't assume that this as my general
    view about this matter.)\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Pablo, are you confident that Triplett
    is a legitimate design?</blockquote>\r\nAgain, \"In this particular case only\",
    I'm pretty confident that getting Triplett from any free-font site is \"more\"
    legitimate and \"more\" ethic that buying it from a corporation that does not
    even know the name of the designer.\r\n"

  body: "With the benefit of your research, I have to agree. But I would add: if the
    original designer is known -or even knowable- I don't think jumping on the designer-screwing
    bandwagon is OK. There is rarely a life-or-death situation requiring the use of
    one particular font; in fact it's usually possible to find an alternative that's
    not \"tainted\" (like the ones Ryuk recommended). At the very least a site offering
    such a tainted font for free should have an explanation, and ideally a way to
    donate to the designer. So in rare cases like this, unless it's pretty impossible
    to reward the original designer I guess I just wouldn't mention the font.  :-/\r\n\r\nBTW
    I think I now understand why you didn't provide a link to a free source... It's
    a dilemma, because those sites contain so much stuff that actually is unethical.
    So I think you did the right thing there.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    But what about a site offering such a tainted font for $$$? It's even worst.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I
    assume Monotype don't sell forgeries?</blockquote>\r\nAtwe, I'm not so sure about
    that ;)\r\n\r\nHrant, I pretty much agree with your crusade to stop the \"Id->Piracy\"
    workflow, in particular when the fonts are from Independent Foundries and living
    designers. But I also detest when it's the other way around: When the big foundries
    take advantage of the users. Because users may lack the knowledge, but big foundries
    does not. For example: Repackaging the same old fonts and reselling it again as
    webfonts is a clear sample of that abuse, as discussed here: http://typophile.com/node/98263.\r\nQuoting
    Mathew Carter: \"The Type business, historically, has made his money by re-selling
    the same typefaces over and over again as different fonts\" (https://vimeo.com/35382795
    around 10'10'')\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Agreed.\r\n\r\nBTW, the crusaders weren't pragmatic - but I am, or at least
    try to be. I won't ID fonts unless I'm confident it's for a good cause; I err
    on the side of caution. But I won't go on a rampage beyond the confines of Typophile
    with delusions of stopping -or even significantly reducing- plagiarism or piracy.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
