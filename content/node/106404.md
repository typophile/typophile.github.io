  body: "Interesting. Pacioli's rule -- as stated at Myfonts-- that strokes should
    be 1/9 of the height suggests that for a caps height  of 690 the stroke width
    should be 77 points and the thin strokes 38. Presumably this font matches the
    spec....\r\nDon"

  body: The small type at the bottom of the poster identifies it as a "constructed
    Roman alphabet" by David Lance Goines. According to [[http://www.goines.net/Poster_art4/poster_85.html|Goines'
    web site]], he published the poster in 1979. Goines is known for his elegant handlettering,
    and I'm not aware that the letters from this poster were ever issued as a font.
    Goines' poster predates [[http://luc.devroye.org/MADType--Pacioli-2007.gif|Matt
    Desmond's Pacioli font]] by 28 years (though both are in the tradition of Fra
    Luca Pacioli's 1509 <em>[[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fra_Luca_Pacioli_Letter_A_1509.jpg|De
    divina proportione]]</em>).
