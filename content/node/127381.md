body: "The top logo with the script \"Caesar\" looks familiar but I can't identify
  the font. I would also like to ask about the tagline \"Car & Truck Repair\" font.
  It would save me time searching several websites for those fonts I need. \r\n\r\nAs
  for the bottom logo, I thought at first that it was \"Copperplate\" font, but I
  can see several different variations. So I would need help identifying this font
  as well along with the font id for \"Car & Truck\" too. \r\n\r\n"
