body: I have the opportunity to extend the character set for a corporate typeface.
  It's a script, meant to look handpainted. I pitched them on the idea of creating
  OpenType ligatures to give it a more handpainted feel, and they'd like to do it.
  But I don't really know what the going rate for something like that is -- the Graphic
  Artist's Guild Handbook talks about rates for customizing typefaces and creating
  new ones, but not really anything this specific. Any ideas based on your own experiences?
  Maybe a per glyph fee?

    Charles de Borges is way more capable than me, since I would really like to do
    type design professionally down the road.

  body: Haha I'm a graphic designer who would like to be a type designer, but I haven't
    released any fonts yet. I'm only weaseling my way into this job because they don't
    know that there are people out there who could do a much better job than me, and
    I do normal graphic design work for them too.

    in your clients eyes by pleasing them. And then you have more time to hone your
    skills as a type designer and learn from Charles.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: If all of us passed off everything to people who are better than us, than
    none of us would take on any work. I see the job as an opportunity to hone my
    skills, and I feel capable enough to do it correctly with the right OpenType code
    and following the curve patterns of the existing font. Maybe we should all pass
    our jobs on to Matthew Carter and Jonathon Hoefler ;)

  body: "I can't think you can do anything other than quote based on your hourly rate,
    plus some padding for inevitable re-work. Under-charging and usin this as a learning
    experience probably isn't a good idea, esp. if you plan to do repeat work with
    this client.  \r\n\r\nHowever I do like the idea of adding some fees for expert
    consultation and travel, and perhaps hiring Matthew or Jonathan for half a day
    to review the work. :-)\r\n\r\nAlso if the \u201Ccorporate font\u201D is being
    used in corporate apps and OS\u2019s be sure that the client understands that
    the features won\u2019t work in those apps.\r\n"
