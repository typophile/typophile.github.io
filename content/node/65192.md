  body: "Thanks everyone for your input. \r\n\r\nWhat I am really looking for is a
    courier with the outlines and forms of a courier. @ altaira: I definetly want
    those long serif on i an l. @ Nick Shinn and johnbutler: I want a professionally
    spaced and kerned font. Setting texts in courier and than spacing and kerning
    - no way, I have done that but no more!\r\n\r\nSo if anyone knows of an actual
    version of the actual outline forms of a courier with professional spacing and
    kerning - please.\r\n \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Courier is monospace by design, it's not just a matter of re-kerning the
    letters, you'd have to make a whole new typeface. The letters are designed to
    have the same width, making the i very wide and the m very tight. I don't really
    see why you'd want to make courier not monospaced. I'd rather look for typefaces
    that have simularities in their letterforms but are designed to not be monospaced.
    It will only look queer otherwise, imho.\r\n\r\ngreetings Jeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

  body: "<em>Do you consider the monospaced Courier to be unprofessional?</em>\r\n\r\nNo,
    he just means a version that is already optically spaced.\r\nHenning is looking
    for a version of courier that is <em>not</em> monosapced, but has the <em>same</em>
    outlines.\r\n\r\n<em>It will only look queer otherwise, imho.</em>\r\n\r\nThat
    may be, but that may also be intended.\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\n\r\nMight I add, intentional
    distortion of typographic rules is not ignorance. Is it simply unimaginable that
    someone might want to make something difficult, ugly, etc? After all type designers
    are often keen on distressed fonts, with their neurotic predetermined 'mess'.
    Small piles of mess neatly arranged."

    family</a> from Optimo.ch, it looks a lot like ahttp://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/index.php?id_categorie=1&id_font=21
    proportional Courier, but it doesn't *look* proportional. Also, there's Optimo
    <a href=\"http://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/index.php?id_categorie=1&id_font=21\">Executive</a>,
    which is more of a fauxnospaced sans.\r\n\r\nBoth keep a certain monospace-edgyness
    to the text, interestingly. Of course you lose the effect of a true monospace,
    and quite frankly why one would want to have some of the disadvantages of a mono
    without going the whole hog is a mystery to me, but whatever floats your boat.\r\n\r\nhope
    that helps\r\nKai\r\n\r\nEdith: fixed link tag"
