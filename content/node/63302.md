body: "Hi I'm looking for some suggestions.\r\n\r\nI've been searching for an appropriate
  serif to use for my personal identity / branding (graphic designer). As such I'm
  quite picky, especially when it comes to type faces.\r\n\r\nMuch to my shame, I
  very much like the majority of Georgia's letterforms and its screen appearance (it
  was designed for screens after all). That said I wont allow my self to use a windows
  default font for my personal identity. Even if no one else notices, just for my
  personal satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBefore I start rambling too much, I better provide
  an idea of what I'm looking for. The straight line ears, for example on the lower
  case 'g' and the cross-bar on the lower case 't' give me the shits, but other than
  a few niggles like that, Georgia I quite like.\r\n\r\nOther fonts I have been considering
  include:\r\n\r\nMrs Eaves XL - http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=212\r\n\r\nI
  like the verticle serifs on the 'T' and the vertical legs (correct term ? I forget)
  of the 'M' and it looks generally pleasing. The XL weight seems to fix most of my
  problems I had with the origional Mrs Eaves (x height etc). Still not quite convinced
  yet though.\r\n\r\nBonesana Pro - http://www.gestalten.com/fonts/detail/?id=ceaea76523135ee601232d96478400bc\r\n\r\nI
  generally like the letter forms here but the angled serifs on the 'E' put me off
  a little.\r\n\r\nI'm also interested in a good range of open-type features. Partly
  why Mrs Eaves XL could be a good choice.\r\n\r\nCould anyone recommend some nice
  serifs (preferably with extensive familys etc) ?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n"

  body: "Yeah thats a nice one I'll keep in mind, thanks.\r\n\r\nJust to give more
    of an idea of what I'm after, I prefer straight (vertical) legs on the uppercase
    'M'.\r\n\r\nAlso that is almost a slab serif, especially in the uppercase letters.
    I was more looking at traditional serifs!"

    look at [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Miller|Miller]], also by Matthew Carter.\r\n\r\nHe
    was working on both Georgia and Miller at roughly the same time and there is a
    certain amount of cross-fertilization. "
