body: "Sampo Kaasila is a Finnish technologist with many contributions to digital
  typography. Probably his greatest impact has been the design of the [[TrueType]]
  font technology at Apple in the late 1980s. Since then, he founded [[Type Solutions]],
  which has created a number of tools (including the basis of the [[hinting]] tool
  Microsoft's [[Visual TrueType]]), and a new rasterizer, T2K. [[Bitstream]] acquired
  Type Solutions in 1998, and now markets the technologies under its own name.\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nMore
