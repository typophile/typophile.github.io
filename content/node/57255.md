  [[Arabic]] scripts, i'm having a hard time finding good images of the different
  scripts and was wondering if maybe someone here on typohile could help me out with
  some good quality images of the different scripts:\r\n\r\n- Kufi and ornament Kufi\r\n-
  Naskh \r\n- Thuluth\r\n- Diwani\r\n- Taliq\r\n- Farsi\r\n- Ruqaa\r\n- Perzisch script\r\n-
  Maghrebi\r\n\r\ni'm not asking for annyone to do all the work for me, its just that
  i'm absolutely no specialist in separating all the different scripts from one another,
  and i obviously don't want to guess. i did find some images on the net but most
  of them are of poor quality. of course i will mention the source of the images in
  my essay and be glad to send a copy.\r\n\r\ni would really appreciate all the help."

    should have no trouble finding some good books that will help identify and describe
    some of these scripts. \r\n\r\nYou might also do a search on Amazon.com to find
    books with images and discussion of these types of scripts. Then use that info
    to help track down those books. \r\n\r\nFinally you may want to ask the folks
    in this particular Typophile forum for their expert advice: http://typophile.com/forum/366\r\n\r\n"

    \r\nIt is a general introduction to the Arabic styles.\r\n\r\nBelow are two more
    links, one in Arabic and in English, that give background information and illustrations
    of the classic Arabic script styles by one of the contemporary masters: Mohamed
    Zakariya. They are a double critique of a book about Arabic typography that is
    so confused about the subject, that it prompted Zak to create a series of illustrations
    to clarify the matter. This review was published first in the Leiden academic
    journal Bibliographia Orientalis (BiOr) and later in the Lebanese computer magazine
    ACCE (Arabic Computing, Communications & Electronics):\r\n\r\nIn Arabic:\r\nwww.decotype.com/publications/2005-10-01_ACCE_HSAF-reviewAR/AlKumbyuutar_cover_story.pdf\r\nIn
    English:\r\nwww.decotype.com/publications/2006-05-01_ACCE_HSAF-reviewEN/2006_ACCE-HSAF-review.pdf\r\n\r\nIn
    order to use the illustrations contained in these PDF's you must ask Mohamed Zakariya's
    his permission (his website above has instructions how to contact him).\r\n\r\nBut
    I am sure these images will help you to get the styles straight. \r\n\r\nThomas

    but still recognizable illegal copy of the DecoType Naskh that we licensed to
    Microsoft.\r\n\r\nThe original DecoType design, adopted by all major players (Microsoft,
    Apple, WinSoft) is literally on every computer in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nTherefore
    it is hard to miss for a specimen book that pretends to cover everything - unless
    the author is an incompetent charlatan who didn't even notice the uncanny similarity
    between PakType and DecoType :-)\r\n\r\nIf you really consider diverting resources,
    please devote them to anti-piracy measures including action against those who

  body: I would never say do not buy a book. Only, which is true for any text, handle
    with care and do not take every word for a bare fact. After all, I have Schopenhauer
    on my shelves despite I think he trivialized Kant in an unacceptable way. (Maybe
    this is what people like Schopenhauer for?)

  body: Yes, I've read much of it. The font technical information is parroted from
    sources on Latin fonts, so doesn't contribute much to the making of Arabic fonts;
    not surprisingly, perhaps, because the author doesn't really understand the technology.
    There is a quite interesting historical overview, mostly showing attempts at Arabic
    typography originating in Europe and well-illustrated, but since these types had
    little or no impact in the Middle East they represent an eccentric history. As
    the review by Mohamed Zakariya and Tom Milo makes clear, the author is confused
    about the terminology of the traditional script styles, so the book is unreliable
    in that respect. Finally, the concluding overview of various foundries' Arabic
    typeface development, while providing useful illustrations -- including some of
    designs that are not available in current digital formats --, misrepresents some
    of these companies and their achievements.
