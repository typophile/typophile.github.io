body: "Is there a better compromise font than Times New Roman for creating contract
  forms?\r\n\r\nI've read a lot of \"best font\" discussion.  I basically get the
  difference between fonts designed for reading on screen and those for reading on
  paper.  Our contracts are typically 3-6 pages (occasionally longer) with 1,750 or
  so words per page (more or less depending).  Generally we use a 9pt, 10pt, or 11pt
  font (never less than 8pt).  Personally, I read and edit almost 100% onscreen.  However,
  my company's customers and my fellow employees read both onscreen (in Word and PDF
  formats) and on laser-printed pages.  And in all cases the final contracts are laser
  printed before being signed (and scanned\u2014so OCR accuracy is a plus).\r\n\r\nSo,
  is there a better alternative?"

  body: For me, this is a place where brand standards would guide these decisions.  The
    font or fonts you choose would reinforce the brand look and feel, and many times
    a brand guide will specify a brand text font.  I guess this decision will depend
    a lot on how coherent your brand is, and what impressions are central to it's
    message.

    is great for screen, but not so great in print. Miller is better for print. \r\n\r\nI
    think your decision really depends on the mood you want, and also what size, measure

    overlooking one key issue. The Microsoft system fonts (Georgia, Calibri, Cambria,
    et al) are designed & engineered to look great on screen in Windows applications
    that use Windows text rendering, like Word. But PDF is a Postscript-based format
    and PDF readers use their own text rendering. (For instance, Adobe Reader uses
    a technology called CoolType. Why? So ensure consistent text rendering between
    platforms.) \r\n\r\nTherefore, in PDF, the MS system fonts have no screen-legibility
    advantage over print-optimized fonts. And since any PDF could also be printed,
    your best bet is always going to be a print-optimized font (like Miller) not an
    MS font (like Georgia).\r\n\r\nFor a longer version of this answer, with screen
    shots proving the point, go here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typo.la/efile1\r\nhttp://typo.la/efile2"

  body: "Matthew, thanks for the point about the advantage of PDFs. \r\n\r\nI have
    a question about screen fonts and contracts. Contracts have complex, demanding
    language, and I would think that even lawyers, who are expert in reading them,
    would want to blow them up to relatively large size for reading on screen\u2014or
    they would actually print them out. In other words, because they are not the kind
    of casual narrative or brief snippet for the web, they would not have the same
    requirements for screen reading as, say, typophile.com. Is this correct?  "

  body: "<cite>Contracts have complex, demanding language</cite>\r\n\r\nTrue, though
    that's nearly always due to flabby, imprecise writing, not necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>In
    other words, because they are not the kind of casual narrative or brief snippet
    for the web, they would not have the same requirements for screen reading as,
    say, typophile.com. Is this correct?</cite>\r\n\r\nI don't frame the typography
    question in terms of \"how will readers use this document?\", because you can't
    control that. Rather, I frame the question as \"how does this document invite
    readers to use it?\" because that's within your control. \r\n\r\nFor example,
    when a software installer puts 2500 words of teeny text in a small scrolling box,
    the typography sends a message. That message is: \"I'd prefer you didn't pay attention
    to what's in this box.\" When half the words are in caps, that message is even
    louder.\r\n\r\nFor another example, I was writing a font license last week. My
    view is that someone buying a font should read the license. \r\n\r\nAs research,
    I read about 25 font EULAs from other foundries. But a lot of those licenses \u2014
    no disrespect to the people behind them \u2014\_are crazily long and dense. I
    have a law degree, and I still had to make little pencil diagrams to follow what
    was going on in some of them. I've no idea what the average MyFonts customer is
    supposed to do with them. But I know what the average MyFonts customer <strong>actually</strong>
    does: ignores them. Because they beg to be ignored.\r\n\r\nSo how do I get someone
    to read a font license? I decided that it should be one short, inviting 8.5\"
    x 11\" page. The customer can print it if they want, but it also had to be legible
    on screen. The text of the license had to fit on the page without any typographic
    trickery (tiny font, condensed font, etc.) That, in turn, put some constraints
    on how the license was written. But I finished it, and the first customer who
    got it said \"Wow, that's a very clear license.\"\r\n\r\nThat's a long way of
    saying that the answer to your question depends on whether you assume that contracts
    can learn nothing from the \"casual narratives\" or \"brief snippets\" that we
    usually see on the web.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the clarification Matthew.  I am aware of the PDF issue you describe
    but I note that in my business of negotiating contracts for equipment finance
    PDF's are normally not viewed (at least not critically viewed) onscreen during
    negotiation.  There is almost always an exchange of Word documents during the
    negotiation process followed by signature copies sent by PDF and FedEx.  This
    is why I am trying develop some insight into the balancing of the readability
    on *both* screen and paper.  And while I myself tend to give a bit more importance
    to screen readability, I think the good screen fonts just don't look very good
    printed.  Thus this thread.  [PS, your book is terrific, and is going on my shelf
    along with Garner and Adams.]\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nWilliam, you make a good point.
    \ There are a lot of methods for dealing with the small-print-being-difficult-to-read
    problem.  In the old, old days there was often nothing to do but tough it out.
    \ But then came copiers that could enlarge the small print--a godsend.  (Long
    ago my company used preprinted forms in 6pt that were often faxed around!)\r\n\r\nNowadays
    with editable word processing files it's easy enough to use the zoom function
    on the computer, this being especially useful if a document is formatted in columns--with
    \"draft\" view you see only one column at a time and there is no horizontal scrolling.
    \ And, of course, there's always the expedient of temporarily increasing the font
    size to 12 or 14 points during editing.  \r\n\r\nSometimes though, a PDF, fax,
    or hard copy is the only version provided for review (bad form, I say, so I always
    ask for an \"editable\" copy if possible).  In this case I've resorted to OCR'ing
    the document so that I can reformat it to read it (and to search and use text
    comparison software).\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nMatthew, have you looked at typography.com's
    EULA?  I recall reading it recently and thinking it pretty good for clarity and
    brevity.\r\n"

    you're describing is a print-optimized font that's been engineered to render well
    on screen in Windows, also known as a hinted TrueType font. I can't hope to speak
    for the TrueType-hinting geek squad at Typophile, so I'll let others post names
    of foundries that sell hinted TrueType fonts that started life as print-optimized
    fonts.\r\n\r\nThe other issue that comes up when you're moving word-processing
    files around is font embeddability. Most commercial fonts can't be embedded in
    a word-processing document. The Adobe Originals are an exception, but they don't
    have any TrueType hinting. \r\n\r\nIs any foundry offering print-optimized, TrueType-hinted
    fonts that also permit editable embedding? I can't think of any, but perhaps others
    will enlighten me.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>have you looked at typography.com's EULA</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    won't single out any one EULA for criticism or praise. Some are better than others,
    but they all have room for improvement. And they could all be shorter."
