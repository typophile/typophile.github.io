  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Wondering if any art directors have advice on what its like, how to best become and typical duties of an Art Director. I have wanted to be a creative director or art director for some time and have been told that I am already doing what they do(as a designer, teacher - and on a below designer salary!) but wondered if there is any advice out there. Topics that would be helpful would be Salary, Duties, Skills, work styles, etc.</p>
<p>Some back history on me if it helps:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Graphic Designer, Illustrator and Instructor of Advertising Design, Photoshop, Illustrator and other technical and theory based class for a local college.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in the field for 7+ years as a designer/illustrator and a teacher for 4+. I only have an AS degree, have won numerous awards and have a portfolio of work spanning companies like Disney to the University of Florida.</p>
<p>Managing and leading is a strong suite for me and i think the experience i&rsquo;ve gained over the years puts me right where i need to be but always felt that having a degree was required&hellip; Now that i&rsquo;ve found out its not&hellip; and have been approached.. can anyone tell me what i&rsquo;m instore for?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a designer for well over two decades (is it three now?), and i can honestly tell you that i have yet to encounter two workplaces that share the same definition of &ldquo;Art Director&rdquo; or &ldquo;Creative Director&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking generally, one would expect an art director to &ldquo;direct&rdquo; &ndash; to move the work/design/concepts forward with his/her own vision&hellip; and that almost NEVER happens! EVERYBODY&rsquo;s an art director these days, especially with the advanced tools/software so available, so it is next to IMPOSSIBLE to call the shots &ndash; unless you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have superiors that trust what you think and stay the h*ll out of your way. Otherwise, become a CEO or something, and tell the Art Director you hire how to do HIS job.</p>
<p>A lot of people get hung up on titles, but I&rsquo;ve never really given them much stock, other than how they reflect on salary. For several years, I was Creative Director of a shop in L.A., then became a full-fledged Partner, but the shop folded and now I&rsquo;m at a new studio labelled as a &ldquo;Senior Designer&rdquo;&hellip; there is no higher position in this group, because the owner/CEO is the high poobah and the final say in all creative (other than the client, of course). His brief attempt to install a Creative Director to take up his lack of time was a disaster, because they never agreed on anything.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">What Scott says is accurate based on my experience as well. For me, an “art director” should really just be another competent designer to bounce my ideas off of and brainstorm with. Depending on how big the firm is, an art director can also be the one responsible for communicating creative strategy with the client. But in my experience, the lines between role of art director/creative director/senior designer are often quite blurry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would add to Scott&rsquo;s assessment, that people make the job their own.
In other words, different people do the same job different ways.
That&rsquo;s particularly true of art direction, where people can come to the same job from different backgrounds, with different ways of working. 
For instance, you may be inclined to illustrate a piece yourself, whereas another AD would choose from illustrators they&rsquo;ve worked with before. Or prefer photography over illustration. Some may use Helvetica for everything, others gotta have a new face for each project.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>hello</p>
<p>My experience is similar to Scott&rsquo;s, I have been a Senior Designer, Head of Design and Art Director - there has not been much difference between the roles and as Scott has already said, different agencies/businesses have different interpretations of what an Art Director is.</p>
<p>My only comment would be that as an Art Director there is much more emphasis on &lsquo;team leading&rsquo;, knowing how to get the best out of your designers, how to motivate them, provide inspiration etc. I have only worked for small agencies, I have no idea how large agencies with fluid design teams define the role of an art director, but as Nick has said most people make the job their own - just be upfront about how you would approach the job.</p>
