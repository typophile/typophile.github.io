  CR. The copy and the headers/drop quotes faces. I've gotta get an article together
  for uni in the style of this magazine, so it only seems fitting to get the right
  faces!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nMG"

    redesign was done by our art director, Paul Pensom, but Paul Barnes worked with
    us a consultant on the typography, advising us on typeface choices, page furniture
    and the logo. For drop caps and other ornaments, we have used characters from
    a new project of his involving the revival and digitisation of the St Bride type
    archive (more on this in a later post). <strong>We've just used Caslon Shaded</strong>
    but there will be a lot more faces available in the future.\u201D</em>"
