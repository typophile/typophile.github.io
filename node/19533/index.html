  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>First of all please excuse me if this is a repost of sorts, I&rsquo;ve searched quite extensivley on the topic, but need some additional help&hellip;</p>
<p>The design studio I work for had a freelancer design some cover art. She ended up using a font found in the user library (OSX) &ldquo;Goudy Old Face&rdquo; an [[FFIL]] font. When we sent the layered art to the press, they called me up and said Goudy Old Face was only a screen font, thus no good.</p>
<p>I searched through my fonts and could not find a Goudy Old Face [[LWFN]] version? So I ended up having to purchase the post scripts for the font and just sent those off.</p>
<p>So here is my question&hellip;</p>
<p>If I only see a FFIL suitcase listed in my &ldquo;User/Library&rdquo;, how do I know it has a printer (LWFN) font?</p>
<p>The reason I ask is, all of the FFIL fonts in my &ldquo;User/Library&rdquo; do not have any visible LWFNs? Which leads me to believe these FFIL files are worthless without their LWFN counterparts.</p>
<p>I found this FFIL to DFONT converter, but I&rsquo;m not sure making DFONT&rsquo;s out of my FFIL&rsquo;s is even going to do anything other than changing the wrapper?</p>
<p>Should I just go into my &ldquo;User/Library&rdquo; and remove all of the FFIL fonts to prevent this in the future?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

If all you have is the FFIL (a.k.a. the font suitcase), and you put this into one of your Font directories, OS X will not show the font in your font menus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not likely to have a name like &ldquo;Goudy Old Face&rdquo;, more likely something like &ldquo;GoudyOldFac&rdquo;. PostScript font file names are usually shortened and must contain no spaces.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The resource fork issue affects the FFIL file, not LWFNs. A FFIL file (font suitcase) has all its information in the resource fork. Only Macs can deal properly with this kind of file. The LWFN (the PostScript outline data) has all its information in the data fork, meaning it&rsquo;s just a plain old binary file, like the kind used on other OS&rsquo;s. If you are not careful when moving Mac font suitcases (FFILs) to and from foreign file systems (the internet, for example), the resource fork may be lost resulting in an empty (0kb) file.</div>

<p>This statement is completely incorrect. LWFN files are also resource-based Mac files. PostScript data is in the resources of type &lsquo;POST&rsquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Incidentally, a dfont is simply a Mac TrueType font with all its data in the data fork instead of the resource fork. Apple uses this format for essential system fonts on OS X because OS X is UNIX-based and, without higher level stuff like Aqua, can&rsquo;t deal with resource forks either. There is no need or advantage to converting normal (non-system-essential) fonts to the dfont format.</div>

<p>They meant it is originally MADE and optimized for the screen, not that it is a SCREEN FONT made out of pixels. So there&rsquo;s no need to look for a PostScript version of it. Everything is in the FFIL file. 
If you&rsquo;re happy with the design just tell them to use it. It&rsquo;s an old myth that TrueType fonts are not printable. Every recent RIP or printer will have no problems using this TrueType font in a font suitcase.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Good point. It didn&rsquo;t occur to me that there could be a TrueType font in the FFIL. That would certainly explain why the font was usable yet didn&rsquo;t have a corresponding LWFN file. I simply assumed from the problem description that it was a PostScript font. D&rsquo;oh!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There seems to be some confusion here. Rather than reply to any specific post, I&rsquo;m going to state things as I understand them.</p>
<p>The FFIL file is what is traditionally know as a Mac font suitcase. In OS 9 and before it generally had a suitcase icon. In the case of a Postscript Type 1 font, there needs to be a LWFN paired with it; this is the Postscript Type 1 Outline.</p>
<p>Another common situation is that the font is a traditional Mac TrueType font. It has the outlines contained in the same file as the Suitcase. There is no obvious way to tell using only the Finder. It does not need to have a .dfont or .ttf extension, and does indeed store critical data in the resource fork. If you add the font to a font manager, you should be able to determine quickly that it is TT.</p>
<p>If a PostScript font suitcase is missing it&rsquo;s outline, it may sometimes be refered to as &lsquo;bitmap only&rsquo; or an &lsquo;orphan&rsquo;. In some applications, these faces may still be available, typically you will get a warning if you try to print them. This situation exists for backwards compatability with certain applications.</p>
<p>If you work in a prepress environment, you may occasionally come across ancient fonts intended to be bitmap only. These exotic beauties were either intended for screen-only use or for dot matrix printers.(remember those?) Nowdays Mac OS doesn&rsquo;t use the old bitmap components that are present in the suitcase, but the suitcase file still needs to be intact.</p>
<p>This may be in the wiki&hellip;</p>

Also, in Suitcase Fusion these fonts may appear with either a green &ldquo;O&rdquo; or a blue &ldquo;A&rdquo; icon depending on their characteristics. This is partly because OpenType and TrueType are part of the same standard. The fonts in this image are provided with Microsoft Office.</div>
