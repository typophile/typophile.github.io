  on a few preferences in regards to generating OpenType PS files.\r\n\r\nI've followed
  the naming conventions suggested by Adam Twardoch except I have abandoned the short
  name usage (Instead replacing Reg with Regular, Lig with Light etc). I'm curious
  if it's standard to keep the 'Use PostScript FontName as FullName on Windows' option
  checked.\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask this question is that ideally I'd like the name
  of the font, when accessed through an application menu to be similar to mac just
  for reasons of integrity such as 'Example' as the font family and the sub menu of
  'Regular', 'Light', and 'Bold'\u2026 keeping it simple\u2026 but on PC with this
  export button mentioned above checked I'm assuming the font will come up as 'ExampleRegular',
  same as the Postscript Name field.\r\n\r\nI know there are previous topics on font
  naming but it all seems rather confusing with the cross-platform and cross-application
  differences.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on generating OpenType PS fonts
  on Mac that need to be cross platform compatible? Any tweaks or adjustments to create
  a real consistency in the majority of 'current' applications and software utilized
  by creative professionals? (Meaning I'm not really worried about Mac OS 9, Windows
  97', Microsoft Word, ATM etc\u2026)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"

    am not sure if I understand.\r\n[a] What do you assign as 'Family Name' and 'Style
    Name', and as 'OT Family Name' and 'OT Style Name'? You have read this in Adam
    Twardoch's document but to emphasize it: For a family to work in Windows it is
    important that a family as defined by the 'Family Name' does not have more, or
    other, styles (i.e. 'Style Name') than Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic.\r\n[b]
    Windows applications usually show the 'Family Name' only, and styles are accessed
    by Bold/Italic buttons. I cannot remember of any Windows application showing 'PS
    Font Name' or 'Full Name' in the font menu, so in <em>this</em> respect, it does
    not matter how 'PS Font Name' and 'Full Name' look like. (It is different with
    Adobe applications. These show 'OT Family Name' and 'OT Style Name' in the font
    menu, and only if not present, show 'Family Name' and 'Style Name'.)\r\nWhat is
    important for cross-platform compatibility of <em>Word</em> documents is that
    in the regular style, 'Font Name' is identical with 'Mac Name', or if you don't
    provide the latter, 'Font Name' is identical with 'Full Name' (see <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/17059\"
    target=\"_blank\"> here</a>)."
