body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am looking for a sans serif font without spacing for ascendents
  and descendents. I tried all caps fonts but the ones I found still have some vertical
  space.\r\n\r\nI will be using this font for its digits (so it could be a digit-only
  font) which will need to be readable (similar to, say, Droid Sans). they will be
  large and I do not want them to take more vertical space than needed. The problem
  I am having is visible on this screenshot: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Na2e1.png --
  there is space wasted above and below the numbers.\r\n\r\nWould you have a recommendation
  for such a \"tightly fit\" font?\r\n\r\nThank you for any suggestions,\r\nWoJ"

  body: Could that wasted space be coming from the leading setting (space between
    lines) of the program displaying the numbers. Leading can be set to 0 in some
    programs.

  body: "@bojev: no, I removed all widget-induced padding. If you look at the horizontal
    fitting you will see that it is tight. The vertical space really seems to be reserved
    for ascendents and descendents.\r\n"

  body: "Virtually all fonts have some \"internal leading\", so you might need to
    customize.\r\n\r\nThere's something else: some shapes (like the top and bottom
    of the zero) are supposed to overshoot the nominal bounds. How would you see that
    handled?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: The font is 'Muli'. This is an example, I also tried with all caps fonts but
    they still have this extra spacing.

  body: "Good, I downloaded the font. What I get is that the ascender corresponds
    to the upper blue line and the descender to the lower blue line in this figure
    which is part of your grab.\r\n<pre>     <img src=\"/files/fig45_4097.png\"></pre>\r\nThe
    Ascent is 1638, the descent is 410 (the em is 2048). The top of the green rectangle
    corresponds to the OS/2 Win Ascent (equal to 1960, also Type Ascent and HHead
    Ascent) and the bottom to the OS/2 Win Descent (Win Descent is 625, Typo Descent
    is -625 and HHead Descent is -625). "

    than your type size?

  body: "The technical term in the days of hot metal for a font that had no extra
    space for descenders (they tended to be all-caps fonts; since some lower-case
    letters have ascenders, I'm not sure how one could have just the x-height on the
    type slug unless the font was specialized) is 'titling' as in Times Titling.\r\n\r\nBut
    with the flexibility of digital typography, separate titling fonts, as far as
    I know, wouldn't make sense, and thus are not offered as such. Since Times Titling
    is stylistically different from the upper-case of regular Times, it could be available
    as a font, but the baseline would not move - digital font standards handle type
    alignment differently from hot metal, so you don't have to tell your word processor
    to move text in an 'art line' face down and text in a 'titling face' up. That
    would be imposing extra work for no reason.\r\n\r\nWhat I think the word processors
    do is this - different faces do still have the baseline in different places on
    the body, because some faces have shorter descenders than others - so if you mix
    such faces on the line, the line is forced to take up more space than your point
    size, even if you have specified no extra space. Fancier DTP programs may give
    you more control."
