body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nWhat do people use in OS 10.4 for typr management. \r\nIs Suitcase
  still the leader in this area? I have been running the standard \r\nfontbook that
  obviously come with 10.4 but I really don't feel comfortable with it. \r\n\r\nI
  have used a Mac for a few years now and every problem that I have with them seems
  \r\nto stem back to fonts? \r\n\r\nCould anyone pass on some experienced words of
  wisdom on where to best store fonts \r\nin OS 10.4 and the most effective management
  systems? \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "It was shown at TypeCon. It's an iTunes-style font manager that, from what
    I saw, works well and has a nice interface (again, it looks a lot like iTunes).
    It'll also allow you to do some EULA management and even browse and buy fonts
    (supposedly Linotype is opening this up to other foundries).\r\n\r\nAnd it's free."

  body: from what i saw of the software, it seemed very ipressive. i wasn't able to
    test any actual "font management" with it, but i'm assuming that it will be pretty
    seamless. i'm also assuming it'll be avail for both mac and windows, right dan?

    I switched to Tiger I also tried FontBook. However, FontBook and Suitcase gagged
    on my collection. Literally. You should have heard the awful noise. The Linotype
    package looks interesting and seemed to operate smoothly -- from what I saw at
    TypeCon. However, I hesitate to use ...

  body: I am also interested in this...I use FontBook but it seems to bog down all
    my applications during opening sequence (loading fonts...10%, 20% etc.) It'd be
    cool if I could have all my fonts loaded into an application but they're all disabled
    until the program says 'I need this font and this font' so they get enabled. Maybe
    I'm wishing for the impossible. It'd just save some strain on my system.

  body: "WIll the Linotype software handle auto-activation? Will it use a plug-in/XTension
    for InDesign and Quark XPress? If so, that's a pretty ambitious move into the
    software business. Software engineers don't come cheap. \r\nOne would assume that
    if the product will be free, it's main purpose is to *encourage* people to purchase
    Linotype's fonts. \r\nIt would seem that there is at least a little room there
    for conflicts of interest. For example, managing OpenType fonts is much easier
    since most OpenType fonts on the market have been recently released and are from
    major vendors. It could be that support for Postscript and Mac TrueType might
    be lacking in the hope of selling people new editions of typefaces they already
    own.  There was some similar discussion around this topic concerning Adobe's Garamond
    Premier Pro.  There are some nice features in those products, but it's really
    a tough sell for people who already have a licensed version of Garamond. \r\nThat
    said, Adobe used to sell both type and manager. But then, Adobe was also selling
    PageMaker and Illustrator. \r\n"
