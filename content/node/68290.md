  logo (and tagline) for a website that we're in the process of relaunching after
  a few years of relative dormancy.  I've perused various font sites, and it seems
  the records for the original site design have gone missing.  So I come to you.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.therevealer.org/\r\n\r\nSo
  many thanks, Ann"
