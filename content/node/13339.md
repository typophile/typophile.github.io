body: i love typophile. i really do. but sometimes it makes me more than a bit sad
  to see us attacking eachother on <em>personal</em> issues. i realize that type doesn't
  exist in a vacuum and that even type design is interconnected with languages, cultures,
  ideologies, politics, &c. Passion is what brings a lot of us to typophile--a passion
  for type. it would be ludicrus to expect that such passionate folks wouldn't be
  passionate about other things as well. likewise, it's unreasonable to to believe
  that we'll all see things the same way. this is what makes typophile so wonderful--to
  see the head-to-head comparison of ideologies concerning different aspects of type
  and type design. however, i think it's a travesty when such wonderful discussions
  spiral out of control and begin to include vicious attacks on each other. it's dissappointing
  to see persons for whom you hold so much respect sink to a dog-eat-dog level, meteing
  out insults on an "eye for an eye" basis. aren't we better than that? is it too
  much to ask for us to use a little tact in what we say here on typophile? i'll admit
  i'm not faultless in this regard, but i do my best to show respect to all of you
  and i would hope to enjoy the same.

    conversations on typophile. I'm may be guilty of this as well, with the shennanigans
    today, it just seems we read into a topic, far enough that we think we have an
    idea, and respond, without actually understanding. And on the other side, I've
    also seen topics that are less than articulate.\r\n\r\n* wow, things are getting
    pretty nasty on <strong>Yves reviews Fleischmann revivals</strong>"

  body: "Paul, if you look at the 5 year history of Typophile you can readily see
    that the drama takes more than one person, but there's always the presence of
    this same guy. I think you could guess who I'm talking about.\r\n\r\nIn the <a
    href=\"http://typophile.com/node/13307\">Fleischman</a> thread someone suggested
    a moderator delete the offensive post. I think I prefer to leave it there in its
    stinking, festering form so people can see for themselves the kind of person who
    otherwise seems to be knowledgeable and helpful. "

  body: 'joe, i wasn''t singling out any one person: i could point fingers at a few
    off the top of my head, but as i say, i myself am not guiltless so i won''t. not
    to mention finger pointing is counterproductive. my personal feeling is that if
    folks want to vent on politics &c. then their own blog is a more appropriate vehicle
    for such things. that way 1) threads on type don''t get hijacked and B) others
    can skip over blogs by persons they may not agree with. '

  body: Paul, thanks for your mature thoughts. I confess that in this instance I've
    let it get to me more than I usually allow it. Peace.

  body: thanks for sharing your thoughts, paul. i agree that it is sad that control
    isn't always easy. i'm just glad no one sits next to me where they would <em>really</em>
    get to see me lose control. seriously, i think you hit the nail on the head. people
    whom are passionate thinkers are usually passionate in more than mind. *sigh*
    indeed.
