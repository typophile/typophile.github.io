body: "I am looking for fonts which read well in small sizes. When I do back labels
  I tend to use universe or helvetica for the mandatory copy and a condensed san serif
  or serif for the story. Nothing ever goes above 10 points. My back labels stink.
  I am so busy I don't have time to do the well but I'd like to improve them. Maybe
  set up some templates with great small type.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? Also any books
  on the fine print or setting small copy. I's an odd topic I know but maybe someone
  tackled it."

  body: Franklin Gothic works well for labels too - it's quite legible in the condensed
    weights. I used it on food labels for ingreds and such as small as 6 pts.

  body: "Use a medium (or demi) style with a pronounced x-height. Preferably a typeface
    that withstands some condensing (around 90%) \u2014 that way you will be able
    to use a slightly larger typesize, improving legibility.\r\n\r\nAlthough sans
    typefaces are considered to be more legible, this is not supported by research,
    so feel free to use a nice serif\u2026 (maybe one by my compatriot Gerard Unger?
    http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-capitolium.html ).\r\n\r\n___\r\nBert

    are versions for 5, 7, 9, 11, 18, 24, and 36 point.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that
    Cycles and Arepo might be all a wine label designer ever needs!"

    which has size specific cuts.

  body: "Wow, thanks guys this is very exciting. Who ever said don\u2019t sweat the
    small stuff didn\u2019t do back labels!\r\n\r\nI would like to have a variety
    of fonts that I can use for small print \r\n\r\nThe Freight Micro seems so unique
    with it\u2019s serifs. Franklin Gothic is good and I use it but I = forget about
    it thanks for reminding me, I haven\u2019t seen it small but it might be limited
    in it's usefulness. I am still wondering what people think of that knock out series
    B. Bell centennial looks like a good font might be really useful. Lafomica.de
    has an ant running around on the page, a note that says just married  and I have
    no clue where the fonts are. Capitolium is great. So much to add to my wish list.\r\n\r\nI
    see a real use for a design reference book showing small type layouts. Cycles
    is nice but I wonder if the Arepo would hold up in 8 points.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
