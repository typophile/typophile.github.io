body: "In the mid 1970s, I partnered with a couple of other graphic designers to form
  a type house. We did work on AM International equipment with a type library of about
  400 faces. By the mid 1980s, it was pretty clear we were losing our hold on technology
  and we bailed. I bought a CP/M computer and typed my manuscripts in WordStar with
  coding entered in parentheses. There was no way to tell if I had coded it correctly
  until I traveled down to a printing house that gladly accepted work such as mine,
  and then saw the final output on photo paper. It was a pretty ragged workflow but
  I did it until 1987 when I got my first mac and QuarkXPress.\r\n  My first digital
  fonts were in the form of screen fonts (no printer fonts). I would compose a job
  and then take the QXP file to a shop that had all of the printer fonts for my screen
  fonts. Still a bit ragged as a workflow, but better than the WordStar routine. Over
  the next ten years or so, I acquired lots of PostScript Type 1 and Type 3 typefaces.
  Most were purchased in collections such as the Adobe Wild Type collection.\r\n  During
  the 1990s I purchased a copy of Typographer from Altsys. I used it only to modify
  my existing type fonts. For example, I added some special characters to my Palatino
  font to use in doing jobs for one of my clients.\r\n  A couple of weeks ago I started
  building an archive of my old typeface library (much of which is stored on old 400k
  floppies). Once all of them are in one place, I'd like to begin a workflow which
  will start with trying to piece as many of them as possible into a collection of
  Type 1 fonts. Then, I'd like to move on and move them into Open Type format.\r\n
  \ I'm wondering if, for the first step, my old copy of Fontographer will do. And,
  then for the next step of taking them to Open Type, do I buy a conversion utility,
  or do I need to bite the bullet and get a full-featured program like Font Lab?  Advice
  would be appreciated. "

    Fontographer and have a product called TransType that converts formats. '
