body: "Greater Albion has just released our latest new family of typefaces, Keynsia.\r\n\r\nThe
  Keynsia family revives the spirit of the 1950s-in fact it\u2019s our first venture
  into the design ethos of that decade. Its simple and elegant lines make for an eye-catching
  set of display faces.\r\n\r\nA range of different faces make up the family, all
  having an extensive character set. Keynsia is available on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/keynsia/overview.html
  | Myfonts.com]] and we've put some examples of it in use on our [[http://gatf.wordpress.com
  | blog]].  In the meantime, here's one specimen image:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Keynsia_Gallery1_Small_3895.png]"
