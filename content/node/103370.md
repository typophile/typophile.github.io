  body: "Unfortunately, it came up with nothing. No origin and not even a loosely
    similar. I don't even know if it's a font actually. My first feeling was \"too
    many circles/bars to be a font\". \r\nAnyway, pretty useless but here are some
    fonts I like for this one: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/trade-printer|Trade

  body: "The jet behind the singer looks like something from the late 50's or 60's.
    If the cover art was prepared then the font would probably have been photo-composition
    Note that the S seems out of alignment -- tilted left -- as if it had been poorly
    applied. If so, then the font was probably something sold by a French equivalent
    to Letraset. Noting Ryuk's search results, the font was probably never converted
    to digital. \r\nThe font has a high waist and an N where the diagonal intersects
    halfway up the right hand stroke.\r\nNT Cornelia has a similar N. \r\nHigh waisted
    fonts were popular before 1900 but few have been digitized.  There is at least
    one high waisted font, but it has serifs. This is <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/eccentric/\">Eccentric</a>
    designed by Gustav F. Schroeder in 1881 and published by Adobe and others. \r\nDon[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eccentric@Adobe_3476.jpg]\r\nMyFonts
    blurb:\r\n\"Eccentric is an all-capital, narrow-bodied, monoline display face
    that could be described as high waisted. With cross-bars and main junctures more
    than halfway up the letterforms, every letter - except the W - has a long-legged
    appearance.\" \r\nDon"

  body: I had a hunch this was a new photo taken in front of an old airplane. It had
    nothing to do with the typography. In the 1950s, when you saw a dude with three
    days' beard and a jacket that didn't fit, he wasn't a pop star, he was a homeless
    guy. [[http://www.bertrandbelin.com/|A quick Google search]] confirmed that this
    album was released on May 27, 2013.

  body: "Well it was a stab in the dark. But you are right, in the 1950's and early
    60s in the Anglosphere, almost everyone looked \"neat\" even pop singers. Was
    this also true of the Franco world? Or had the 5 day unshaven look already arrived?
    I defer to pop culture experts.\r\nAs an alternative to photo-composition, the
    letters could have been selectively  stretched in Illustrator or Photoshop to
    create a high waist effect.\r\nAn easy font to make, which has with some appeal,
    as laurent's post indicates. I'm surprised that there seems to be nothing on the
    market, or released as an amateur creation.\r\nDon\r\n"
