  clarify who designed the logo \r\nand if it was ever turned into a whole typeface?\r\nhttp://www.ac-dc.net/\r\n\r\nMy
  second questions is a bit more legally-wise.\r\nThis is a wellknown logo,\r\nand
  it is easy to see it around,\r\nbeing sold printed to t-shirts aand other parafernalia.\r\n\r\nIs
  all this merchandising legal?\r\nHas the use of the logo a liscence agreement with
  the designer?\r\nIs it ilicit to use it with out previous consent from the band
  or the designer?\r\n\r\nit is not like i am going to open a \"club de fans of AC/DC\"\r\nand
  sell merchandising of them to make a living.\r\n\r\nAll this questions are for better
  knowledge of subject,\r\n\r\nHere the last follow up questions,\r\nis until what
  point is it legal or ilegal tu use this or another logo,\r\nand tweek it for a new
  design.\r\n\r\nIn my case, i have designed a t-shirt for a limited editions brand
  in NY\r\nand have used the same letterstyle to create a satire or parody,\r\nas
  asked by my clientes... Basically I was asked to change AC/DC to AD/HD...\r\nNow
  the cliente and friends want to printed for a limeted edition of 120 Tshirts,\r\nbut
  are unsure about if it is legal or not.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thought and
  share your knowledge about subject.\r\nSurely Miss Tiffany will have to say.\r\nTo
  her or to however can bring light to subject, \r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is clearly based on the AC/DC logo. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I want to clarify some things regarding the AC/DC logo. In July of 1976 I
    was hired by Bob Defrin of Atlantic Records to design some lettering for the AC/DC
    album called \"High Voltage.\" This was not a logo, but lettering for the album.
    In April of 1977 he hired me to design the current orange beveled AC/DC logo for
    an album. This was just a job like any other record job: you did some sketches
    and you did a finish. I have never really used that art for promoting myself as
    it was probably one of only two jobs in my career that shared an unusual quality
    in my work: it was all made out of straight lines. This was not particularly virtuosic
    for one who prided himself on custom hand lettering. I have recently resurrected
    my credit for it as it seems to touch a lot of generations. This and some guitar
    playing has indeed made me cool with all my children's friends. How's that?!\r\n\r\nI
    would like to make one other comment as to the design, as this seems to be often
    disputed, particularly with writers who speculate and not seek a source. This
    logo seems to be one of the first heavy metal, goth-style logos, but its origins
    are misunderstood. No, there are not meant to be any fascist undertones...I designed
    a piece of lettering for a live Blue \xD6yster Cult  album for John Berg called
    \"On Your Feet or On Your Knees.\" The album showed a church on the front with
    the Cults' limo on the cover. The back was a photo by Don Hunstein of me holding
    a bible with the credits on it. My thought on the cover was to take the metallic
    car marque idea and combine it with lettering reminicent of the Bible. I remembered
    this lettering when designing one of the AC/DC sketches and used this as my source.
    So you see that this logo is more Gutenberg than goth...\r\nAs for typefaces,
    I have seen an attempt in the December issue of Guitar World magazine with Dimebag
    Darrell on the cover, but I had nothing to do with that. As for parodies, they
    are what they are."

    be sure about what I was guessing and what i remembered from last Typecon.\r\nGerard's
    talk was something like 10am... ;)\r\n\r\nalthough very enriching to read, \r\ni
    dont know if the answers regarding what i was asking where clear.\r\n\r\nin the
    AC/DC logo.\r\n- Is all this merchandising legal?\r\n- Has the use of the logo
    a liscence agreement with the designer?\r\n- Is it ilicit to tweek it with out
    previous consent from the band or the designer?\r\n\r\nas for the particular design
    AD/HD, \r\nit was postponed due to this issue\r\neven before this thread, thats

    Probably not, somebody will have ripped it off to sell cheap t-shirts somewhere.\r\n\u2013
    The licence probably belongs to the band or the record label.\r\n\u2013 Are you
    likely to get consent to parody/satirise the band? With or without that consent,
    are you doing something that you would be happy if somebody did to your work?
    I think if you have any doubt it is probably worth getting a proper legal opinion
    before proceeding.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n"
