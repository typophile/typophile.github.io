  of the areas I'm keen to learn more about, that's currently unclear to me, is Humane
  Modernism\u2026 does anyone know what this means in typographic terms? \r\n\r\nAlso,
  does anyone know if certain serif typefaces were used by practitioners of \"the
  international style\"? I'm guessing it was all sans serif, but some sans typefaces
  have humanist qualities that could make them good for long text settings, when it
  comes to typesetting my report?"
