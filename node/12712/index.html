<p>I  will attending my 2nd TypeCon in NYC. I went to Minneapolis 2003.</p>
<p>This year, I am stopping in Chicago for about 5 days first. I now have 
a small letterpress shop so I would like find out where I should go 
while in Chicago.</p>
<p>Where do the cool types hang? Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Looking forward to finding out who is going and meeting some of 
you again,</p>

<p>And, you HAVE to go to Millenium Park, which is pretty cool, specially in summer time:</p>

<p>Also, as someone mentioned above, avoid Navy Pier. It&rsquo;s cute, but it&rsquo;s not that nice. Go to the Hancock center observation room though, the view is more than amazing.</p>
<p>Try going to neighborhoods like Wicker Park/Bucktown and Wrigleyville, they are nice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll second Prairie Avenue Books and the Goldstar though. Around the Wicker Park area (which is where the Goldstar is), I&rsquo;d also recommend the Beechwood Tavern (great jukebox, cheap beer) and Leo&rsquo;s Lunchroom (huge sandwiches, great potato salad). If you&rsquo;re in the mood for a pub crawl in that area, you could also hit Rainbo, the Inner Town Pub, Zakopane, &amp; Phyllis' Musical Inn.</p>
<p>You should also check out the Newberry Library. If you&rsquo;re an out-of-towner, you can get a day-pass (you have to have an Illinois ID to get a year-long Reader&rsquo;s Room pass). Quite a nice collection of old books (Nuremberg Chronicles, Plantin&rsquo;s Polyglot, Ratdolt&rsquo;s Euclid, etc.), as well as volumes from the early 20th century. If you want directions on the &lsquo;el&rsquo; and a short walkthrough of which floors the various collections are on, email me off-line.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing some work on the Vandercook Universal I at the University of Illinois lately. If you feel like playing with some type while you&rsquo;re here, you&rsquo;re probably welcome to come by for a day (I&rsquo;ll have to check with the folks I&rsquo;m working with).</p>
<p>Great Thai food (southeast Asian in general really) is off the Argyle stop on the red-line train. And the best Indian is on Devon Street, not far from the Argyle area.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>[WARNING: This is completely off-topic. If you don&rsquo;t care about how I feel about Millenium Park in Chicago, do not, under any circumstance, read this post. Thank you.]</p>
<p>Well, frankly, a lot of my dislike hinges on personal taste. I can&rsquo;t stand Frank Gehry&rsquo;s buildings. And I&rsquo;m horrified that the city paid an unholy sum of money for a building that&rsquo;s not even a building, but is a giant sculpture. I think if you pay a man to design an amphitheater, especially if the man is a world-renowned architect, he should make some minimal attempt at designing it with a mind for acoustics. What we have is a pretty steel frame with speakers hung from it, over a flat green lawn, in front of Gehry&rsquo;s bulbous, tiled homage to himself.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Anish Kapoor&rsquo;s humongous steel bean. Not even sure what to say about it, since it&rsquo;s been under a canopy for the majority of its life. Once again, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of Kapoor, and I&rsquo;ve no doubt that less money could have been spent on a sculpture that&rsquo;s as good as the bean, and is actually visible. Although I&rsquo;m sure that once all the welding seams are completely buffed, I&rsquo;ll faint in a swoon.</p>
<p>The 2 monolith fountains &hellip; I just don&rsquo;t get it. And the pseudo-classical colonnade on Michigan and Randolph &ndash; well, I&rsquo;m once again prejudiced in my hatred for useless historicism. To its credit, it&rsquo;s not as horrific as the H Washington public library.</p>
<p>But aside from my unbending beefs with the art and architecture, I just can&rsquo;t get over the amount of money wasted. I don&rsquo;t remember the figures anymore, but the amount that the whole project went over-budget was truly staggering. And on the few occassions I find to go to MP (I take drawing classes there once in a while), I don&rsquo;t see many Chicagoans. Most of the folks there seem to be the out-of-towners going to the museums and shopping the &lsquo;Mag mile&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have one of the worst public school systems in the country, which is deperately in need of funding (as well as other major changes, no doubt), but what the city gets is a nice park? Huh? No doubt tourism brings a mess of cash into the city&rsquo;s coffers, but I just can&rsquo;t get behind this one. Probably because the kids from CPS wind up at my college. Luckily for them, it&rsquo;s 2 blocks from the park. So I guess they can forget about their criminally sub-par secondary education, and go play in the fountain or look in the bean-shaped fun house mirror.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant. I should be able to see the humor in all of it.</p>

Compulsory schooling was invented to: teach the kids the Official Party Line; and free the moms to work (i.e. slave). It&rsquo;s just a gilded brainwashing/babysitting scheme. And how could it be anything else in this system? And that park is the decoration that distracts from the truth about the system.</p>
