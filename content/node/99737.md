  learning FLS, so I assume I'm doing something stupid, but I can't nail down what
  it is.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to modify the font Crimson, adding in a tabular oldstyle.
  I've already added two discretionary ligatures (no problems), and amended the OT
  substitution so that it correctly subs in ligatures and c2sc, and it all works great
  in-browser using font-feature settings (the main aim of the exercise).\r\n\r\nI
  copy the oldstyle figures to a line in the private use area, set a width, name them,
  add a <code>tnum1</code> OT class, then add a <code>@pnum1</code> to <code>@tnum1</code>
  OT substitution, then compile, at which point I get the \"GPOS feature 'kern' causes
  overflow of offset to a subtable\" fatal error.  If I bypass the classes, and just
  substitute manually (zero by zero.tnumoldstyle &c.), the console tells me I have
  a script error somewhere else, despite the syntax being typed correctly throughout.
  It's driving me crackers, and I keep destroying perfectly good font files. Any advice?"

  body: The 'kern' overflow error is a [[http://www.google.com/search?q=feature+%27kern%27+causes+overflow|fairly
    common one]], but I'm not sure how adding oldstyle figures and related code would
    suddenly trigger it. Is it possible that you've also modified the kern feature,
    or added new glyphs to classes that are referenced by the kern feature?

    said that the kern feature had been modified. In this case, the font had already

    of adding tabular oldstyle figures made no mention of any changes to the kern

    And editing program not taking table design into account when generating AFDKO-syntax
    data from which the table will be compiled. Anyway, this is something that users,
    i.e. type designers, should not be bothered with ..."

  body: "<blockquote>the description of adding tabular oldstyle figures made no mention
    of any changes to the kern feature.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nMy guess is that FontLab
    copied the kerning of the proportional OsF along with the glyphs to the tabular
    OsF. That would explain a change in the kern feature which leads to the overflow
    error.\r\n\r\nThe solution would be to delete the kerning of the tabular OsFs,
    they, being tabular, should have no kerning anyway.\r\n\r\nIt would be best to
    keep the kern feature code as it is (uncheck \"Generate Opentype kern feature
    if it is undefined or outdated\" in the FontLab options under \"Generating OpenType
    & TrueType\" \u2192 \"Kerning\").\r\n\r\nI just tried opening Crimson-Roman.otf
    in FontLab, and while the existing kern feature code compiles fine, as soon as
    I regenerate the kern feature code (via the OpenType panel menu \u2192 Generate
    kern feature), it fails with the overflow error."

  body: "I'm guessing that the old style figures you *copied* to the the Private Use
    area are in the original font with a name, but not an Unicode index (which is
    proper).\r\n\r\nIf you're using layout software that requires a Unicode index,
    rather than \"copying\" them to PU, just assign a PU number to them without changing
    the name. Should work, and since the kern feature as found in FontLab will be
    using the name, it shouldn't care that you've added a PU Unicode index.\r\n\r\nThen
    follow Jen's advice.\r\n\r\nBTW, as far as personal bias goes, if it was a font
    I was interested in, I'd just write a new Kern feature -- actually, I'd rewrite
    all the features, but that's because I have a stock set I've gotten comfortable
    with over the years. I think this not a bad approach for a user, whose primary
    concentration lies elsewhere."

    make sure I've followed everything up before going on holiday. Anyway. I had looked
    at all the other threads relating to the overflow error, and followed the advice,
    hence the original post.\r\n\r\nThis was just done to have a fully-featured OT
    font I could use live on a website to play with a wide variety of font-feature
    settings in modern browsers without tossing too much money at it - the reason
    Crimson was chosen was because <i>most</i> of what I would need is already present,
    unlike other free/cheaper fonts. Could just drop back to something good on Typekit,
    but then an element of control is lost.\r\n\r\n@Jens, tried clearing the kerning
    data, and tried keeping the kern features as-is, but no dice, still throws the
    overflow error. But following @charle_e's advice, I seem to have managed to force
    it through. It then susequently chokes on further changes of any kind, so temporary
    fix at most. I think you're right though, and I need to rewrite the kern feature.
    More work initially, but at least I know I can then have something that will display.
    And yes, I do realise the current spacing is dubious @hrant, so I'll give it a
    go.\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice, it was very useful, and at the very least pushed
    me to learn in a bit more detail how OT tables store the data. Still want to scream
    at FL most of the time, but I see why it throws crap at me now"
