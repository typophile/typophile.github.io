body: Hi I have gone full circle with my client who wants a student guide magazine
  produced including logo from a version similar to his original at the bottom right
  through based on his comments (mostly negative) I am now stumped! The guide is for
  UK students and is a trendy useful directory of gigs, theatre... plus articles.
  he wants a logo that students will like?? are these just rubbish and i am wasting
  my time trying to be a designer LOL

  body: "It sounds like your client maybe isn't providing very much context or direction
    for you. Wanting 'a logo students will like' is way too vague for it to be much
    help for you.\r\n\r\nWhat are your clients goals with the redesign? What didn't
    work with the original logo?\r\n\r\nWe could comment on these, but it really wouldn't
    be much help in terms of what your client wants."

    The logos are very sterile, not "student" hip. Go pick up a Spin or Rolling Stone,
    flip thru, look at ads. Get inspired.

    beginning. It also depends whether this magazine has a base client\xE8le. In that
    case I would suggest evolution in logo instead of revolution.\r\n----\r\n<em>Robert
