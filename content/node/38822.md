  body: Hmm, yeah that was fast matching. Thank you so much. Any ideas for the boxbound
    design?

  body: I agree that boxbound is custom, thought it may be based on <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/horatio_light/?sample_text=boxbound&sample_size=60&acs_p=1&acs_pt=24&acs=1">Horatio</a>.

  body: Hmm, I can see how it comes from Horatio. Thank you for your insight. It was
    particularly the "n"/"u" that I was interested in, but that seems to be the customised
    part if it comes from Horatio. Oh well. Thanks for your help Jan and Stephen.
