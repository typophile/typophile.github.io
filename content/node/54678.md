  body: "I don't know of any books specifically about poetry book typography. But,
    I'd actually go to a bookstore and look through the poetry books. Find a few that
    you think have good typography and then decide what it is that makes them good.
    \r\n\r\nYou could also find sites of book artists such as Jason DeWintz at <a
    href=\"http://www.greenboathouse.com/books/backlist/index.html\">Greenboathouse
    Press</a> and observe what they are doing. \r\n\r\nOther than that Bringhurst
    is always a good start."

  body: In the UK Faber, Penguin, Picador and Cape all do poetry very well. Also the
    small hardback series by Everyman which I think might be from the US. Unfortunately
    a lot of the things I see from specialist poetry publishers such as Carcanet are
    not especially well designed.

    :) I happen to have a couple Bringhurst books and will definitely search for Jason
    DeWintz's work.\r\n\r\n@ Justin: I have access to Penguin, but I'm not sure I
    can find those other brands here in Brasil. I'll try.\r\n\r\n@ Oprium: Thanks
    for the samples. Those do look good!\r\n\r\n@ Kent: Those look beautiful. Thank
    you\r\n\r\n@ Mekri: Minnesota is a little out of my way. Hehe, but I did find
    a nice book for sale over there. It's called \"The Book as Art\"\r\n\r\n@ Paul:
    I would love to see those. Will try to find any.\r\n\r\nTiff and Kent, I might
    bring a copy of this book to Atlanta and you can see how it turned out. :)\r\nThank
    you all for the great tips!\r\n"

  body: "Tiffany's right: One good way to think about designing poetry books is to
    go to a library or a bookstore and look at lots of poetry books. See what you
    can figure out about the relation of the design to the actual texts. Some questions:
    What do you know about the poets? Do the poems demand extra special design considerations?
    When were the poems written? When were the books published? Who published the
    books? How much importance do you think the publishers place on design?\r\n\r\nIt
    is especially helpful to look at poetry anthologies. In those you will be faced
    with many styles of poetry, requiring some complex design decisions.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure exactly what help the Minnesota Center for Book Arts would be, unless
    one were designing and printing an artist book or limited edition. But we do have
    presses here in Minnesota that publish poetry, often in well-designed editions:
    Graywolf Press, New Rivers Press, Holy Cow! Press, Milkweed Editions, Coffee House
    Press among them. They may be hard to find in Brazil.\r\n\r\nFrom one who has
    designed many a poetry book. have fun; good luck.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "I don't at all mean to be facetious, but the poetry itself is the \"best
    reference.\" \r\n\r\nLong lines? Indented lines? If lines turn, will they conflict
    with the indented lines? But if there are also short lines, does it all get lost
    with too long a measure?\r\n\r\nHow about titles, will they center, or look odd
    that way?\r\n\r\nAre there subtitles? Do some poems have a dedication?\r\n\r\nAnd
    so on. Poetry is usually graphic, so the design has to accommodate what is there.\r\n\r\nBTW
    the story Bringhurst told (at least, at one time), was that his start in printing
    came about when he was a member of a group of poets. They decided that one of
    them had to learn about printing, and he drew the short straw."

  body: 'I do not know whether my two cents are relevant here, but respecting the
    poet''s intentions should be the overriding principle: not the page width or depth.
    My first job in poetry was a big fat anthology, so many of the poems were printed
    already. The number of instances where the editors of all levels left line turns
    as introduced by the previous typesetter for reasons of column width alone was
    astonishing.'

  body: "paragraph wrote about \"respecting the poet\u2019s intentions.\" Here's a
    tale about that.\r\n\r\nWhen a publisher brought me a poetry ms a few years ago,
    there was the instruction to \"maintain all the poet's line breaks.\" Looking
    for line breaks that might give trouble, I found one really long line, too long
    for the publisher's requested trim. But the publisher wanted graphic proof, so
    I set the poem with that long line, as well as a poem made up primarily of very
    short lines, and showed sample pages. To fit that long line (this poem was centered;
    not all others were) I had to set the sample in something like 7.75/10 and take
    that line far too close to the bind. Then, going beyond the call of duty and budget,
    I redesigned the whole book for a larger trim to fit that one poem, set at a better
    (larger) type size. I showed both samples and the publisher chose the larger trim.
    I set the whole book. It was sent out to the poet in page proofs.\r\n\r\nWhen
    page proofs came back, the poet had asked for that whole damn line to be deleted.
    Not shortened through editing, but deleted. I got on my high horse and told the
    publisher the line was NOT going to be deleted. I was not going to have all my
    work disrespected like that. Besides, the line meant to much to the poem, at least
    to my reading of it.\r\n\r\nIn the end we kept the long line, all the poet's other
    line breaks mirrored her ms, and we used the larger trim size.\r\n\r\nSometimes
    a typographer knows a poet's intentions better than the poet does.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Hey Will, Paragraph and Charles, thanks for the tips and stories. I really
    appreciated.\r\nI did not receive the poems yet, so I do not know what I'll be
    facing. Of course the poem itself is the best reference. I just felt like doing
    some \"homework\" before getting to it. \r\n\r\nClarice Lispector was a big brasilian
    writer. (actually she was born in Russia, but moved down here pretty young). This
    is a letter she wrote to her linotypist at the time:\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry if I've
    been making too many typing mistakes. First, I burnt my right hand. Second, I
    really don't know why. Now, may I ask you a favor: do not correct me. Punctuation
    is the phrase's breath, and my phrases breath like this. If you find it weird,
    respect that too. Even I was obliged to get used to myself. Writing is a curse.\"\r\n

    expect from Lispector. Where do you find that? In a book about her? or a book
    of her letters? I have my own quirks of punctuation; I dislike when they get \"corrected.\"\r\n\r\n*****\r\nTo
    add to Charles' comment: There is a pretty large number of people who came to
    printing and typography when they were trying to get their poetry printed the
    way they wanted to see it. Or because they liked the all-in-oneness of printing
    their own poems. Clifford Burke, Kim Merker, Phil Gallo, William Everson would
    be among them. \r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "With poetry you usually cannot take alot of liberty with regards to typographic
    embellishments; e.g. indents, tabs, line breaks and whatnot. Adding such things
    might completely alter the meaning of the poem, which isn't desirable.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I typeset poetry -- which I do quite alot -- it's usually a case of typesetting
    it the way the poet wrote it. I have to decide what typeface, pointsize, leading,
    how many empty lines between the title and the first line and between the last
    line and the poets name, etc. \r\n\r\nIf problems arise, for example if a line
    doesn't fit the width of the page, care must be taken with the solution, usually
    by asking the poet what he thinks would be acceptable."

  body: "For an award-winning long poem by the Canadian poet John Terpstra published
    by the Netherlandic Press and printed by The Porcupine\u2019s Quill, I took the
    approach of having the longest line determine the width of the page; the number
    of lines in the longest section determine the height of the book, and the number
    of sections determine the length of the book. I used Monotype Sabon and one of
    Jan Tschichold\u2019s methods of 'non-arbitrarily\u2019 determining the  positioning
    of the textblock and the margins. Furthermore, rather than clothes-lining the
    lines in each section from the top of the text-block, I anchored every section
    to the bottom of the text-block. Only one section went the distance. Because John
    sectioned the poem so that sometimes there was only one or two lines to the section,
    several pages have only a line or two, again anchored to the bottom of the text-block.
    In one instance a verso contains only one word and the facing recto, two.\r\n\r\nIt
    worked wondefully. The lines appear to well up from below, and the pacing is great.\r\n\r\nI
    believe I was immersed in the book-design practives of the Dutch graphic designer
    Henk Krijger at the time. He pioneered a \u2018gestural\u2019 approach to formatting
    text, positioning type, especially standing heads, running heads, folios and the
    like as well as orchestrating pages."

  body: "An experience such as Peter had designing that book for Netherlandic Press
    does not come along very often. Such clients are rare. Most often a publisher
    decides trim size and desired number of pages. Then it is up to the designer to
    make sure everything fits. Often by either setting things very tightly or very
    loosely to meet those design guides. Even presses noted for design excellence
    (such as Graywolf) rarely move a book beyond those bounds.\r\n\r\nPaper and presses
    come in standard sizes which yield a few standard book sizes. Bookstores have
    pretty standard size shelves, and marketing people have standard expectations
    about what books should look like.\r\n\r\nIn the instance of the book I noted
    above, for which I changed the page size, that only happened because the production
    manager at the design shop and I were good friends with the managing editor at
    the publisher. We prepared estimates showing how much the oversize book would
    cost against the standard size, showing that there'd be little cost difference.
    That sealed the deal.\r\n\r\nKudos to Netherlandic for letting the designer exercise
    some muscle and thought.\r\n\r\nAn article about designing poetry from the Canadian
    magazine \"Devil's Artisan\" is available here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sentex.net/~pql/DA.html\r\n\r\nyou

  body: Very true aboutthe standard book sizes and such. Most poetry books I designed
    had these limitatons as well. Although usually not on the number of pages, since
    this really depends on a number of different things. Plus they're usually perfect
    bound paperbacks (no sections but loose leaves), so a few more or less pages doesn't
    really matter.
