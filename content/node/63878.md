  body: "Always look at three glyphs, never two. Although you can only kern one glyph
    against another, you need the third glyph for context. \r\n\r\nThe best program
    to do kerning in is the one you designed your type in.\r\n\r\nDo not automate
    the process, you will not learn very much if you rely on automatic tools.\r\n\r\nBefore
    you even begin to kern, make sure your glyph metrics are as perfect as they can
    be.\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to redraw the glyph if you cannot get it spaced or kerned
    satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nUse your eyes."

    only recently learned for getting glyph metrics right even before kerning. Even
    better, look at a string of letters."
