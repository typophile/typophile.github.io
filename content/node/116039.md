  typefaces seem to belong to this style; Droid Serif, Adelle, Silica. Finally, though,
  I noticed that FF Olsen was designed in 2001. Is this the face that everyone else
  seems to be copying? Or did this general style of face originate at an earlier time?
  (Of course, I don't mean \"general\" in the sense of looking for the origin of Egyptians
  like Stymie.)\r\n\r\nEarlier, I had mistakenly put Gandhi in this category, but
  now I see that it isn't really this kind of face.\r\n\r\nEven Charter, although
  not as slab-like as these faces, has some hints of the style."

  body: What are you seeing as a common feature between these fonts, other than their
    "slabbiness"? They seem rather varied to me. Is it the idea of a slab serif with
    contemporary design features that you see as the common factor? Certainly, it's
    not a style that produced so many notable examples for a while, but going back
    to the eighties and nineties what about Boton, PMN Caecilia, ITC Officina Serif,
    Corporate E?

  body: "And going back to the 60s and 70s: Adrian Frutiger's Glypha and Serifa, Margaret
    Calvert's eponymous typeface Calvert? Haven't slabs \u2013 though cleary going
    in and out of style to a large extent \u2013 often closely followed concurrent
    developments in other typefaces? Both Sans and Serif styles have influenced slabs
    throughout. Pinpointing an origin \"within the style\" may not even be enough!
    Could FF Olsen exist without (less slabby but just as wedgy) 80s typefaces like
    Charter (which you mention), Oranda and Swift?\r\n\r\n(And even groundbreaking
    \"first typefaces\" often tend to be less original if you scratch the surface.
    Something as supposedly radical as Futura, for example, was wrapped in a cloud
    of similarly-styled influences.)"

  body: "It may well be Beton ExtraBold that I've seen in some instances, and PMN
    Caecilia has the unusual letter C that I've seen as the distinctive feature of
    some of these faces. ITC Officina Serif and even URW Corporate E do seem to be
    in the space I'm thinking about as well.\r\n\r\nAnd while I might pass by some
    of the faces you mention in your next post, Oranda definitely is related to the
    genre I'm thinking of that seems to be so popular nowadays.\r\n\r\nAlso, the face
    of this type I'm seeing on web sites is Noticia.\r\n\r\nBut then I even lump Arek
    into this group."

  body: "Yes, I wasn't necessarily implying that these 60s and 70s fonts were necessarily
    part of the same sub group, merely that they \u2013 in a similar way \u2013 attempt
    to represent the (then!) contemporary in the slab genre. \r\n\r\nI'm guessing*
    that different aspects have appeared at different times, and outside the slab
    genre as well, and that they've gone into new slabs eventually. The super-chunky
    wedge serifs? One possible starting point (together with Oranda) is Mark Simonson's
    [[http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/kandal|Kandal]] (1994), but both are
    otherwise different (?). The cut-and-curve constructions in many of these typefaces?
    See the [[http://typophile.com/node/41687|long discussion in this previous thread]].
    And so on.\r\n\r\n*Still without knowing what exactly you're looking for! Perhaps
    you could draw up a comparison image highlighting some pertinent details, using
    Myfonts samples?"

  body: "I'm not sure myself exactly what I'm looking for, what it is about so many
    contemporary wedge and slab serif faces that make me think of them as almost redrawings
    of the same face - or at least make me think, apparently incorrectly, that one
    typeface of this kind, whatever it is, has had a tremendous impact on type designers,
    making many of them explore that genre.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the type, some of
    these faces - plus some that are normal serif and sans-serif faces - look to me
    as if they're in the same person's \"handwriting\", as it were, coming from the
    same prolific designer. Thus, for some reason, some <em>very</em> subtle typeface
    characteristics seem to be spreading like wildfire in the type design schools
    - I've found this tendency most pronounced in faces identified as being from new
    designers or students.\r\n\r\nEither something strange is going on, or it's just
    me - I'm so comfortable with the old typefaces from the 1960s and before that
    I'm lumping contemporary faces together without appreciating them individually.\r\n\r\nI
    had noticed cut-and-curve in some of those typefaces, but I don't think I considered
    it a defining characteristic. But at least that one apparently <em>did</em> have
    a known origin point, the italic of FF Quadraat by Fred Smeijers.\r\n\r\nAnd then
    there's Falcon - which actually made it to posthumous availability - and Stuyvesant,
    which was at least used to typeset <em>The Shirley Letters</em>. W. A. Dwiggins
    just keeps getting more and more interesting... first, I learn that he designed
    the digits \"dek\" and \"el\", and now this."

    what it is exactly myself but I've actually been having the same feeling towards
    many contemporary typefaces. It does seem to be a trend which pops up now and
    then and I particularly see it in low-contrast wedge serif typefaces.\r\n\r\nIsn't
    Skolar of the same sort as well? For some reason I often have to think of Skolar
    and Adelle even though they're quite different from each other. \r\n\r\nHere's
    a quote from the description of Skolar: \"Equally, features such as its relatively
    large x-height, robust serifs and low contrast make Skolar a reliable choice even
    at small sizes.\"\r\n\r\nI feel like those are probably the commonalities between
    many of these type of typefaces. I think the trend might be to update classical
    typography to contemporary standards where the ability to read text at smaller
    sizes becomes even more important (due to the need for scalability in digital
    typography), and thus you see a higher x-height, a lowering of the contrast and
    a more minimalist approach."

    Slab Rounded]]\r\n[[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/breve-slab-title/|Breve

    is <em>not</em> based on an ellipse. Instead of fighting against Bezier curves
    to approximate conic sections, or to imitate a quill pen at work, the new freedom
    afforded by modern type design tools is being put to use.\r\n\r\nAnd <em>that</em>,
    of course, points to the superellipse of Piet Hein, and its typographic embodiment
    by Hermann Zapf - <em>Melior</em> - as a typeface which, although not a member
    of this group, as being very definitely one of the roots of inspiration that led
    to it becoming possible."
