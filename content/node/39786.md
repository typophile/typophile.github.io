  Break out the ale and ascenders and hide the women and kerning tables - it's time
  to celebrate. Happy birthday, Delve!

    women) to celebrate.\r\nWhat Stuart's holding looks pretty good for staters. :)
    \ Actually, my wife\r\nand son are taking me out for a Creole dinner tonight.
    Bring on the gumbo!\r\n\r\nDan, the weather here has finally decided to cooperate
    with the season.\r\nSo it's cold and wet but I don't mind. I just wish it didn't
    get dark so early.\r\n\r\n"
