  <BR> <BR>a short cut of what they mean is below for more see.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://typographi.ca/000734.php#000734"
  target="_blank">http://typographi.ca/000734.php#000734</a> <BR> <BR>&#39;Bad Type
  may be interpreted as that which does not fit with convention and could include
  work created by typographic dissidents and revolutionaries, or material used for
  rebellious or seditious purposes. Bad type might deal with work that purposely disobeys
  normal typographic customs to achieve wayward ends or it may cover material created
  to facilitate naughty, mischievous or roguish purposes. It could also include the
  curious work of amateurs with no particular design talents. The theme of Bad Type
  may be applied to individuals, their work, the purpose behind their work or the
  processes used to produce it.&#39; <BR> <BR>
