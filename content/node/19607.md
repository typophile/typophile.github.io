  of a few very important pieces of work and I lost it in a hard drive crash. Please
  help...without suggesting another font :)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

      fonts or files I did not have backed up, that is why I am asking here. I back
      up on a LACIE and on DVD with all my files. Along with this I post them on a
      server. This was one font that did not make it to any of these...crazy that
      it did not. \r\n\r\nAnd yes I am professional, SIR. \r\n\r\nRIB RIB"

    so many requests like this on the \"amateur\" boards, I sort of expected that
    the pros would know better. I guess the answer is a little bit of both. \r\n\r\nHypothetically,
    <strong>if I had actually purchased that font</strong>, I would expect that Garage
    fonts would replace it, at least at a small fee. If they were unable or unwilling
    to do that, personally I would have no qualms about going to where I know it can
    be found and getting it.\r\n"
