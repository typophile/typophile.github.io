body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am wondering if there is a somewhat \"complete\"
  (ha-ha...) overview of small type foundries and their \u2013 often so excellent
  but hardly noticable \u2013 fonts, that makes it easier to find something \"special\"
  aside the beaten path of big foundries like linotype, fontfont, etc.\r\n\r\nBackground
  story: I criticized the designs of a friend of mine because he always uses always
  the same, \"boring\" fonts. I mean, the most innovative thing he did was to use
  Myriad instead of Frutiger... But his arument was that it took him way too much
  time to find special fonts that would fit better because he first needs to know
  about the different foundries, look whether they have something useful for the job,
  make sure that it quality work (in design, extent, technical aspects), and often
  purchase is somewhat more difficult than with the well-known big foundries (because
  he is used to them).\r\nDoes one really need to be an \"insider\" in fontdesign
  to know \"small\" things like (just for example) MacRhino-Fonts, Storm Type, etc.?
  Is there a book, website, etc. that is specialized on these foundries, getting an
  overview of independent works? Myfonts is okay, but there, the big players are present
  as well, which is okay, but makes things too vast. Of course I can propose some
  things to him sometimes, but I'm not omniscient, up-to-date, and I'm not a tell-me-the-perfect-font-answering-machine.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help\r\nSebastian"

    over Europe, or online, of course ;-)\r\n\r\nBoth Indie Fonts and Indie Fonts
    2 are beautifully-bound type specimen books, more equisitely-designed than almost
    any catalogues made since the 1930s. They are sold at good prices, too, especially
    since they have been out of a little bit now."

  body: "Sebastian,\r\n\r\nYou could also make a list with the URL of your favourites
    (thanks for mentioning mine) and youst send that to your friend. I would say he
    needs about 5 minutes to judge weather he think MRF is good or bad in his opinion.
    All my retail typefaces have pdf-specimen for download. I still carry a small
    amount of printed catalogues which could be sent for a $12 + p&p. This goes for
    most of the other indie foundries as well. If you supply him with just a tiny
    list, you could open new doors for your friend. \r\n\r\nMany diesign sites also
    carries foundry lists. Netdiver, Icograda etc etc\r\n\r\nAt least a start...\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "While it's good to have ten to twelve fonts that you use on a regular basis,
    your friend sounds a little lazy. It may cost a little bit of money, but it might
    not be a bad idea to get some kind of collection with a good number of fonts to
    start with. I know it's one of the \"big guys\" and not one of the indie firms,
    but <a href=\"http://store.adobe.com/type/collections.html\">Adobe's collections</a>
    might be a good place to start.\r\n\r\nAre you considering firms like Emigre and
    House to be big firms?"

  body: "You could just connect him with 3-5 suppliers (could be designers, foundries,
    resellers) whose products are consistently high-quality, which have simple online
    purchasing options, whose designs are fresh, and which offer a good variety. Even
    if a few foundries get left out, it would be a good start for someone like your
    friend who is apparently cut off from the vibrant options available now. \r\n\r\nQuality
    of product (complete character sets, good digitization, expert spacing & kerning,
    robust, versatile families, reliable font performance, etc.) should be a primary
    criterion. Not every small foundry is able to provide this level of quality. Not
    to mention originality of design.\r\n\r\nSuggestions: \r\n\r\nStorm\r\nHouse\r\nH&F-J\r\nVillage\r\nFeliciano\r\nFontBureau\r\nDevice\r\nOurType\r\nJim
    Parkinson\r\nJosh Darden\r\n\r\nDon't throw a huge list at him. If you picked
    4 from this list, whose products don't overlap much in style, then it would be
    a big boost to his options, but not overwhelming. If several are reselling through
    fonts.com or myfonts, then all the easier. It might turn out to be a great intro
    for him to the wide world of indie fonts. "

    few years, especially with OpenType.\r\n\r\nI still think printed specimens give
    you the best view, so yes, Indie Fonts is good. There will be a new FontBook soon.
    Veer has done some nice specimens, which include the foundries it distributes.

    and enjoy the specimens/layouts when you have a few minutes to spare. I'm also
    excited about the new FontBook, as it should be quite comprehensive.
