  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear typophiles,
i asked for your help months ago about fonts for a satirical journal about Africa and Maghreb. A lot of things happened but let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s kind of the same project, the Middle-East added in the focused areas. The word bakchich is the french for baksheesh (the funny thing is we decided to name it  when i was searching fonts, and felt on the T26 baksheesh which doesn&rsquo;t really fit the journal but had that fine name)
Other than giving a causual and friendly look, the idea of this big ligature was somewhat to give an arabian look, without going on a fake arabic. Using only western script letters but bounding them in a way which could relate to oriental scriptures. 
It&rsquo;s supposed to be finished, and already used on some things, but i guess it may need some little changes, so your critics are more than welcomed.
The stick aside the b on the horribly stroked 2nd pic will be replaced by the website address of the journal.

		<div class="commentbody">A couple of things I would look at are the inside bottom of the counter of the c, the angle of the leg of the k, and make the ba ligature a bit broader. I would also look at how the tops of the letters and the dot on the i look if they are parallel with the baseline. On the outlined version I would look at some of the nicks and bumps, especially at the bottom and the i.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks a lot. I am going to look at the things you have noticed, and try to correct  them. I have already tried some things you mentionned, and made some choices. I prefer the tops of the letter as it is here than parallel with the baseline, a possibility i have tested — i find it too rigid. The inside of the C has been a big problem, i have tested several possibilities, and i&rsquo;m not happy with the current state, but i don&rsquo;t really know how to improve it… by making it rounder ? About the &ldquo;k&rdquo; leg, i had made it parrallel with the other vertical lines but it didn&rsquo;t work well, so maybe the problem is the angle is not different enough from the vertical lines one ?
Thanks a lot again, i&rsquo;m working on it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">From about 4 o&rsquo;clock to 6 o&rsquo;clock the inside of the c should be thinner that is the direction I would look. for the k I would look at rotating it more anti-clockwise to make the angle. And while I am commenting the h&rsquo;s should be a little wider to make the join of the strokes less cramped.

		<div class="commentbody">Sweet. If I had to be critical I would say that the &ldquo;k&rdquo; is a bit too cap &ldquo;R&quot;ish looking. I think it also breaks up the flow a bit as it has a horizontal aspect to it in the center, that the rest does not. Idid a screenshot an explored the issue for a couple of minutes, this is a direction I would suggest trying, although I am not sure it would solve the issue of it looking &ldquo;R&rdquo; ish. It does however deal with the horizontal issue. 
Without being overly critical , I would say it looks great, as the context is completely understood, the issues mentioned are really minor. <img src="/images/old-images/back.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The dot over the i looks a tad small. I&rsquo;d like to see it be taller (top to bottom) and slightly wider. Not with the same proportions you have here, but proportionally a bit taller than it is. Right now it looks visually a little too narrow.</p>
<p>On the k, have you tried slanting the lower part of the stroke enclosing the counter? I&rsquo;d be interested to see what that looks like, especially combined with alchion&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
