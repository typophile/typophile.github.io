  Script: A History <em>by Gerry Leonidas</em></strong>\r\n\r\nOk, here goes: the
  development of the Greek script (like the [[Latin]], but with different sources)
  is divergent in the two cases. But although the script precedes the Latin it does
  not have direct links in any of its cases to [[inscription|inscriptional]] forms.
  Instead, the roots of both Greek cases are in manuscripts of the Alexandrine and
  early Byzantine era, when people were writing on softer materials. The [[capital|capitals]]
  maintained \u2014 and, indeed amplified \u2014 the presentational and theatrical
  elements, being used mostly for [[titling]] and ecclesiastical documents (read:
  a conservative context) and their echoes survive to this day in specific pockets
  of scribal and typographical documents, as well as hagiography. The [[lower case]]
  has its root in secular documents: records, tranactions, literary works, and the
  like: written fast, on cheaper materials.\r\n\r\nThe sack of Constantinople by the
  crusaders in 1204 helped a flowering of Cretan letters; and the impressively timed
  second sack by the Ottomans in 1453 (geddit?) sent a small army of Greek scribes
  to the Italian peninsula. They hit the ground in the middle of the Renaissance interest
  in all things Classical Greek (and especially Aristotle; see below). They took with
  them the fast, joined secular script they used in volume into their new jobs as
  editors, proofreaders, typesetters, printers, and teachers (importantly of the offspring
  of the well-to-do literati, who would grow with this script for their Greek notes).
  Note that there was, as you would expect, a range of styles within the genre of
  this secular Byzantine script. The first printers tried out the different styles,
  but it was [[Aldus Manutius]]\u2019 choice that edged out its competitors \u2014
  not on stylistic grounds, since other styles were equally well accepted, but primarily
  due to his typographic choices (cheaper, small format books) and editorial policy
  (good progress towards the works of Aristotle, whose were deemed the ultimate texts
  for scholars to contemplate.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. But throw in professionals
  that are simultaneously very conservative and mindful of what the competition does,
  and you get exceptional continuity in the typographic style. By the end of the eighteenth
  century we have seen a simplification of the forms and the development of a more
  typographical script, but nothing like the top-to-bottom re-jigging of the Latin
  script. At the end of the nineteenth century there are essentially two \u201Cold\u201D
  styles, one upright (French) and one inclined (German) plus an inclined style less
  than a century old.\r\n\r\nThen mechanical typesetting hits the horizon, and in
  the early years of the twentieth century [[Monotype]] single-handedly flips things
  on their head by fixing for Greek the upright=primary, inclined=secondary model,
  albeit not without exceptions (single-variant typefaces continue for many decades).
  Although there are now local [[foundry|foundries]], their innovation tends to focus
  on display styles, and the parameters for text-setting are firmly set on the Monotype
  mold. This situation continues until after WW2 and the Greek Civil War (1944\u201349).\r\n\r\nFirst
  signs of new ideas come in 1956\u201357 with [[Times New Roman]] Greek: this is
  a very strange beast, whose design echoes on one hand the rationalizing tendencies
  of the International Style and on the other the primary/secondary style discussions
  [[Stanley Morison]] and [[Jan van Krimpen|van Krimpen]] were having. This distorted
  template set the tone for text typefaces for quite some time, breaking ranks with
  a 500-year history. Fast forward to the early seventies, when [[Linotype]] introduced
  a whole new raft of typefaces (most importantly [[Helvetica]] and [[Baskerville]],
  but also [[Souvenir]], [[Century Schoolbook]], later [[Optima]]) for [[phototypesetting]].
  [[Mike Parker]] recounted eloquently one aspect of this chapter during [[TypeCon]],
  at the celebration for [[Matthew Carter]]. What he did not comment on was that at
  the time Greece was smack in the middle of a military dictatorship bent on distancing
  the country from the \u201CSoviet menace\u201D. The sound bite \u201Cwe belong to
  the West\u201D was often repeated then, and it is within this context that the Linotype
  typefaces were developed: explicitly eschewing \u201Ctraditional\u201D elements,
  and going for a more \u201Cwestern\u201D texture. This was a radical stylistic re-appraisal
  of the Greek typographic script, perhaps equivalent to the adoption of the sans
  serifs for running text in the Latin script. Even within this very particular agenda,
  Linotype did a pretty good job of producing these typefaces: they \u201Cjust worked\u201D
  especially for the documents the emerging middle classes would be producing: magazines,
  advertising, ephemera, and so on. Combined with a very long gap in any significant
  typeface development by any manufacturer these Linotype typefaces set the tone for
  the whole of the seventies and eighties. (I recall when I started working in 1986
  that major service bureaus would get by simply with the basic Linotype set, relying
  for variety on the considerable range of compression/expansion of the forms their
  typesetting equipment would afford).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAll this gives you a decent
  context for the eighties, which is much more complicated as a narrative by the switch
  to monotonic, the gradual change in equipment in small printers (small Heidelberg
  platens giving their place to A4 / A3 offset presses), the DTP thing which was essentially
  driven by new box-shifter companies with no design personnel, the implications of
  the ISO8857-9 encoding (and the related Win1253, and the really crappy MacGreek)
  for font piracy, the early nineties explosion in small bureaus, the complicated
  tertiary educational environment in design, and a few other things it normally takes
  me quite some time to go over. Fast forward to the mid/late nineties, when [[Adobe]]
  was working on [[Minion Pro]], which \u2014 correctly, for its time \u2014 was pitched
  as a workhorse text family \u2014 what Times should have been, in a sense. Shortly
  after followed [[Myriad Pro]] and [[Warnock Pro]] (the latter a bit more adventurous
  than Minion in the Greek). These typefaces updated the Greek canon and provided
  some useful tools: a good [[polytonic]], substantial [[character set|character sets]],
  wide [[family|families]], and [[Unicode]] [[encoding]].\r\n\r\nSince the mid nineties
  Greece is becoming increasingly more confident of its position and culture, with
  the zenith marked by the entry into the Eurozone and the Olympics. Less observed,
  but equally important, was the proud welcoming of the Byzantine heritage, signified
  by the major \u201CGlory of Byzantium\u201D exhibition in the Metropolitan a few
  years earlier. In short, the not-so-clearly defined Byzantine character, which mixed
  influences, religions, languages, and traditions, was recognized as a full (and
  in my view the main) progenitor of the modern Greek society.\r\n\r\nSo, as Minion
  was reflective of the less confident nineties, needing to re-state the fairly old
  paradigms, [[Garamond Premier Pro]] Super-Long Name Extra revisits the sixteenth
  century models for the Greek, and updates them for the current context, in a very
  twenty-first century interpretation. In many ways it would have been impossible
  for a major publisher to put out a typeface like this much earlier; but the time
  is ripe now, and similar approaches in less visible quarters echo this approach
  to re-interpreting Greek. So, if you want a text typeface with all the bells and
  whistles, give it a go.\r\n\r\nTo read the full discussion, see the thread on <a
