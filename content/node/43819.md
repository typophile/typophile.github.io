  one in the corner of this site already.

  body: "Yesterday (when Typophile seemed completely dead), I thought I noticed that
    the generic favicon had become the default Drupal face. I found this slightly
    odd, \u2019cause I didn\u2019t think Typophile was Drupal-driven."

  body: No, Typophile is Drupal driven. I don't remember the thread off hand, but
    this has been discussed before.

  body: "I noticed that too - the favicon made an April Fools appearance.\r\n\r\nPunchcut
    - I also liked the previous/next thread bit of the nav, that might be something
    nice to implement in future upgrades."
