  body: I would personally suggest tweaking a mix of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Rockwell">Rockwell</a>
    or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=memphis">Memphis</a>
    (for the I, E) with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/heldustry/">Heldustry</a>
    for the rest.

  body: Great suggestions -- one tricky thing though. As a student with no cash, I
    wonder if there are any fonts I could use that come standard with the Adobe CS3
    suite. Rockwell is in that list, so the I & the E should work there. Any suggestions
    on the other letters from the standard fonts?

  body: Although not CS3 package fonts, Eurostile or Helvetica (or Swiss 721) may
    be your closest bet for fonts you already have. I think Eurostile is closer (at
    least in the bowls of the D, R), but the terminus of the leg of the R looks like
    Helvetica's.

  body: Eurostile is in my package whether it came with CS3 or not for Mac I have
    no idea.  Thanks again so much...my finished product I think looks close enough.  THANKS!
