  I am new here... and 18 hrs old typophile. \r\nThis is my first post. I thougt I
  would start off by getting some feedback on this letter integration attempt of mine.
  The letters I have used are the intitial of my name... 'V' and 'C' ( for Vinu Chaitanya).
  I would be grateful if you would spend a couple of minutes to tell me what you think
  I need to do to improve it in any way. I found the integration of V and C to be
  challenging because of the structures of these two letters... one being round and
  curved while the other having slanting lines with a pointed end. Waiting for feedback.\r\n\r\nVinu

    been fond of the play of black and white, using gestalt to define or create space.
    I think this is successful."

  body: "I'm with Tiffany and Chris in liking the integration very much as well. It
    looks like you spent a lot of time on it. The only parts I don't love are the
    V's serifs. They remind me of <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/copperplate-gothic/>Copperplate
    Gothic's</a>, which I find jarring here. I'd suggest either extending and refining
    them, making them more traditional in appearance, or removing them altogether.
    At the least, the righthand serif on the left stroke of the V needs to be smoothly
    bracketed; right now, the transition between the stroke and the serif is too abrupt.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I better chime in with a \"welcome!\" as well."

    body: "Your combination is elegant. I would question your decision to crop it
      so closely on the sides. The tension created where the V's serifs touch the
      edges of the white rectangle is . It creates some strong figure-ground relationships
      that don't enhance your nice combination. How would it affect your design to
      center it in a square with space all around? \r\n\r\nWelcome to typophile.\r\n\r\nBill"

  body: Elegant! Before reading Reed's comment I also thought about the V's serifs,
    see if you can find an alternative, if you don't like it you can always stick
    with the original, which is lovely.

    Here are a couple of alternate options...or should I work on the serifs of the
    first one itself??? \r\nVinu Chaitanya\r\nGraphic design sutdent\r\nIndia\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/option1_5013.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/option2_5441.jpg]"

  body: Between the two revisions, I prefer the serifed V, as the unserifed one feels
    a bit plain, as well as oddly proportioned for a sans serif letter. The V's new
    serifs are impeccably executed. My only concern is that the serifs place emphasis
    on the white space in between the V's strokes, distracting from the white space
    shape of the C. You might try removing one of the serifs to see if that de-emphasizes
    the center white space as it should be. But, again, I really like your design
    -- it feels fresh, but is easily "read."
