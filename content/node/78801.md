  use Helvetica. However, the \"a\" or the \"r\" don't look like any version of Helvetica,
  but are very similar to AG Book.\r\n\r\nSo, do they use (some version of) Helvetica
  or AG Book? (Please see samples attached.)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRG"

    have been tweaked to better fit in the logos. By the way the bold and black 'a'
    from (not Neue) Helvetica aren\u2019t so different."

  body: "Thank you all for your reply.\r\n\r\nJens & Jan - In fact, I started having
    my initial question after I had had a look at the letterforms of Helvetica on
    the <strong>Die Neue Haas Grotesk</strong> specimen book and on the <strong>Helvetica
    Plakat</strong> specimen book; these letterforms look neither like (not Neue)
    Helvetica nor like Neue Helvetica.\r\n\r\nLooking at the logos in question, my
    first thought was that \"Berthold Helvetica\" (if it's the same as AG Book of
    Berthold) had been used.\r\n\r\nFinally, what riccard0 has to say may be the reason;
    before the advent of the digital technology, especially with phototypesetting
    being around, it may be difficult to maintain consistent contours in letterforms.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know...\r\n\r\nRG"
