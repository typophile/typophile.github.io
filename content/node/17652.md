  body: "Hi Tommy, I'm afraid you won't be able to find this as a font. These numbers
    were designed specifically for their intended use and are as such unavailable
    to the general public. This most probably isn't even a digital \"font\" as you
    and I know it.\r\n\r\nH&FJ's <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/numbers/more7.html\">Greenback</a>
    is the absolute closest you'll get."

    body: "\r\nThanks...\r\n\r\nThe samples of this font came from an auto assembly
      document in the late 1960's to early 1970's. Our family business used the same
      font on invoicing/purchase order documents which I'm trying to reproduce. It's
      got to be out there somewhwere."
