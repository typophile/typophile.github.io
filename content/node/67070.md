body: "Can anyone suggest a Modern face (we're currently using a Bodoni from Monotype)
  for use on a digital press. This would be at about 14pt - so a display face, really.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Both HTF Didot and ITC Bodoni have optical weights, so you could try running
    a proof of each and just use whatever prints best.

  body: "14 pt is not really a display size. \r\n\r\nMore between text and deck. Our
    Consul Deck is available at: http://www.terminaldesign.com/Fonts/#/ConsulDeck\r\n\r\nCaption,
    Text and Display sizes are also available."

    apparent size.\r\nTo me Times is not a text face at 14, but Berling is.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
