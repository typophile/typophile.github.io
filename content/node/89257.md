  Heller, has a brilliant Type Tree from Bauer created in 1937 on the occasion of
  the foundry's 100th anniversary.  He's reproduced the extensive text illustrating
  the tree's myriad classifications and mentions that it's probably not entirely accurate.
  \ I'd love to see this community weigh in on Bauer's accuracy in explaining their
  tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
