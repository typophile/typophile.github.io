  body: "GQ is in a state of perpetual redesign, adding and dropping typefaces every
    few issues. But I believe this sample dates from the period when they were making
    extensive use of Titling Gothic.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/sans/TitlingGothicFB/\r\n\r\nWe
    need a close-up on the type to be able to make a definitive ID."
