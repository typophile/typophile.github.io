  body: Looks very, very close to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=clarion">Clarion</a>.
    One of the toughest parts of this sample is that the strokes on the U are of equal
    weight, admittedly something that could have been customized.

  body: "Clarion doesn't match in micro-details, such as the high inner join at the
    top left of the M. WhatTheFont reported <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/pastor/semi-bold/\">Pastor
    Semi Bold</a>, which has the right U symmetry, but the serif treatment on the
    \"S\" doesn't quite match. This could be a custom job - aside from the U symmetry,
    it's a pretty generic modern cap.\r\n"
