body: Hi, I&#39;m in the somewhat unenviable position of having to reproduce the Texas
  Heat Wave bit of this graphic. They were supposed to supply this to me, but they
  seem to have forgotten or something. Please help me identify the font that&#39;s
  been manipulated here so that I can do my best to remanipulate it in similar fashion.
  <BR> <BR>thanks, <BR>Alex<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/39672.gif"

  body: This looks so amateurish it could as well be custom drawn. <BR>Check the dreadful
    &#34;X&#34; and &#34;S&#34;. <BR> <BR>P.S. Are you from, like, you know, down

  body: I know, it&#39;s awful. Nope, I&#39;m no Texan. I&#39;m from Wisconsin, but
    usually live in Chicago. &#40;I&#39;m currently in Green Bay, an exile of love&#41;.
    However, I&#39;m doing some freelance webmastering in Texas so I have sort of
    an electric toe in those waters. And thank goodness I&#39;m working with people
    in Austin. <BR> <BR>Anyway, please, if anyone can identify a font &#40;any font&#41;
    that approximates this thing &#40;with its&#39; S and W especially&#41;, I&#39;d
    be much obliged. <BR> <BR>This is a request that will stop being relevant tomorrow
    afternoon, for reasons of deadlines, etc. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: This looks custom drawn. I think it&#39;s extremely unlikely to be a font.
    Notice how the E&#39;s and A&#39;s differ and how the shadow changes in the two
    T&#39;s.  <BR> <BR>If you need to re-create it, they don&#39;t come any easier
    than this. It&#39;s all straight lines. If you are handy with Illustrator &#40;or
    something similar&#41; it shouldn&#39;t take longer than 15 minutes to do. Just
    paste your sample into the background, zoom in, and connect the dots.
