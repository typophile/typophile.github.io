body: "Greater Albion has just launched Admiral on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/admiral/
  | Myfonts]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/admiral/ | Fontspring]].\r\n\r\nAdmiral
  was inspired by and extrapolated from the Art Nouveau lettering incised into the
  facade of a local hostelry.  This gave us some inspiration for the capitals 'A',
  'B', 'C', 'E', 'H', 'I', 'L', 'O', 'S', 'T' and 'U'; we then had great fun extrapolating
  the rest!  The source of the name Admiral can be spotted if you look at characters
  such as 'A', 'H' and 'N'.  Admiral's distinctive charm and humour lends it to projects
  with a 1900s Art Nouveau theme, be they book covers, posters, signage, invitations,
  cards, or anything else you enjoy!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Admiral_5585.png]"
