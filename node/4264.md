    paragraph palette&#39;s little triangle.

  body: David, if you select the text first, I think you&#39;ll get exactly what you&#39;re
    after. You can check a line, a paragraph, or a pair of words - assuming you have
    not made micro-adjustments within any of those wording groups - and you&#39;ll
    get a readout for the spacing.
