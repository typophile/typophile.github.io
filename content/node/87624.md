  but need advice. (As the Critique section has been a bit desolate lately, I'm posting
  this here to catalyse the discussion for the sake of finishing my typeface before
  New Year.)\r\n\r\nTo what extent is <em>Rhetorica</em> a good name for a text typeface?\r\n\r\nI
  chose the name mainly because of it's meaning in Spanish:\r\n\r\n<em>\"f. Arte de
  bien decir, de dar al lenguaje escrito o hablado eficacia bastante para deleitar,
  persuadir o conmover.\" (Real Academia Espa\xF1ola)</em>\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I
  can't forget it's etymology, which is the art of public speech. I like the way the
  term has been generalized to the written language in Spanish-speaking countries,
  but I don't know if this has happened elsewhere. I was aiming at rhetorical device
  rather than rhetoric per se. \r\n\r\nDo you think the majority of people will misinterpret
  <em>Rhetorica</em> in relation to the interpretation I'm aiming for?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFor
  those who feel they need to see my typeface to tell better, it's in the Critique
  section (I already inferred it :-) ). I'm not doing any advertising here."

    understand the difference between the two interpretations you're contrasting.

  body: "Rhetorica sounds pretty good. I'll go over to the critique section and see
    what the type looks like.\r\n\r\nThe word Rhetoric, at least in North America,
    has shifted meaning. You will often read or hear pundits saying things like: \"Enough
    with the rhetoric, we need action.\"\r\n\r\nSo there is some confusion or meaning-drift
    that equates rhetoric with sophistry -- ie: that rhetoric is deceptive word-play
    that is either without value (at best) or designed to fool the audience (at worst).\r\n\r\nOf
    course, that's not the real definition of rhetoric. I think Rhetorica is enough
    removed from this misuse of the term rhetoric that it will be just fine.\r\n\r\n"
