body: "Hello guys, I'm writing to present my new font family called Bommer Slab.\r\n\r\nAbout
  the Project:\r\nBommer project started in January of 2014 and I am happy to announce
  the first family - Bommer Slab - is now ready for release. This family includes
  14 weights - been seven uprights and seven italics.\r\n\r\nThis font has a strong
  personality, that makes it perfect for use in headline sizes but means it also works
  gracefully within text blocks.\r\n\r\nBommer Slab is just the beginning: a rounded
  version will be launched next month (May 2014) and condensed and sans versions are
  estimated for the second semester of 2014.\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://dootype.com/bommer\r\n\r\nMyfonts:
