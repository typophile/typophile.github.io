body: I've seen typefaces like this (and several other similar ones) that are very
  open and light, with harder, angular corners instead of smooth round ones. can anyone
  give me some leads? thanks!

  body: thank you! after some googling, looks like people seem to have .. uh... challenges
    with getting in touch with The Foundry. Hopefully they'll reply. If not, it looks
    like Blender may be an alternate.

    a large or small license?

  body: Then perhaps the trouble is with their email rather than what I presumed was
    an unwillingness to deal with small fries.

    (Pro)</a> by Nik Thoenen has a similar look-and-feel as Foundry Gridnik as you
    are looking for those angular types.
