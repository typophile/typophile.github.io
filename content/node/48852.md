body: "Today Firefox notified me of the 3.01 update and because I'm still running
  Tiger I can now enjoy the benefits of facing (my) fonts using the font-face tag
  ... in this case [[http://www.taptaptap.com|taptaptap]] set in Fertigo. Found on
  [[http://www.css3.info/font-face-in-the-wild/|css3.info]].\r\n\r\n(OK ... bold isn't
  bold and the italic is slanted and they are using the old Fertigo, but it still
  looks nice :-)\r\n\r\n"

  body: Interestingly I am using Firefox 3.01 and cannot see the Fertigo fonts as
    shown in the css3.info screenshot. Did I turn off @font-face somehow?

  body: My mistake. Firefox now shows installed fonts on your system. The font-face
    tag isn't supported unfortunately
