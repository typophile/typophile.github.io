body: "have posted two articles on my [[http://arabictype.wordpress.com about | blog]]
  about the characteristics of Arabic type. I have grouped the characteristics in
  four categories:\r\n\r\n1. General characteristics: that relate to the representation
  of the Arabic alphabet and number of glyphs needed in the font files.\r\n\r\n2.
  Inherited characteristics: what Arabic type has taken from the calligraphic representation
  of Arabic text.\r\n\r\n3. Acquired characteristics: how print and digital technologies
  have affected the shape of Arabic characters. Special focus was made on the introduction
  of the Linotype hot metal system and the resultant Simplified Arabic style.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SimplifiedArabicConcept_3566.jpg]\r\n\r\n4.
  Visual characteristics: this will be focus of the next article in the series and
  will speak about the visual design principles that are not always followed in the
  design of Arabic type.\r\n"
