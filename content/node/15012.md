  know of a digital version for sale?

    old type books, but nothing digital. I'm not suggesting it doesn't exist, but
    I have had zero luck locating it. Sorry.\r\n\r\nMaybe somone else has some insight?"

    up with nothing. It had been digitized for high-end proprietary typesetter fonts,
    but most of the equiptment has been sold for scrap by now.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"

  body: '[[Image Club]] licensed and digitized Stymie Hairline from ITC back in 1989.
    That particular version of the face was removed from the Image Club library for
    quality reasons during our tenure in the [[Adobe Type|House of Adobe]] around
    1997. You can still find Stymie Hairline on used Image Club LetterPress CDs, which
    pop up once in a while. I may still have a couple buried in the basement somewhere...
    Just be warned, this digitization is a bit rough around the edges.'

  body: "Again, thanks for the info, folks. \r\n\r\nThe current owner of the ImageClub.com
    (is that you, Grant?) has a few copies of the LetterPress CD available for $200-$250,
    depending on the physical condition of the disc.\r\n\r\nGrant, can you describe
    what was \"rough\" about the digitization? Bad point placement, incomplete character
    set, ... ? I really want to use the face for a magazine project, but it would
    be set at display sizes -- 72 pts. and beyond -- where bad beziers can't hide. "
