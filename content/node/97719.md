  I wonder if I'd become so accustomed to seeing Caecilia on that little monochrome
  screen every day that it might start to look odd to me when I see it IRL. So ever
  since the first Kindle came out, I have an extra little hesitation to work through
  before using Caecilia in a project.\r\n\r\nAm I being too sensitive?"

  body: Not at all. The associations a typeface carries are part of its overall impact
    and effect. That doesn't mean you shouldn't use Caecilia, but you should be aware
    of the added baggage from using "the Kindle font." Could be a bonus, could be
    a negative, depending on the situation.

  body: "<blockquote>Am I being too sensitive?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis reminds me
    of something I encountered at school; people would love the little band they had
    discovered and be absolutely devoted to them until they became big or someone
    they did not like had heard of them, at which point they were dropped like tainted
    meat."

  body: Yes, hence the lyric references from Si and quadibloc. (Si was not being sarcastic,
    though it might have sounded that way.)

    the situation with an additional lyric reference.\r\n\r\nHowever, the actual title
    of the Simon & Garfunkel song was Cecilia."

  body: "I've used Kindles for awhile now, and I eventually grew tired of Caecilia.
    Overexposure, I guess. \r\n\r\nNow I'm happy to see a few more typeface choices
    on the latest Kindle, plus the embedded fonts that some publishers are putting
    in their e-books. So, yes, when I see Caecilia IRL, I might recoil a bit. Maybe
    that's just me, though. "

  body: I am also using Kindle, and in fact they are "not struggling" but they are
    making innovative ideas and taking the new leap instead. Their latest device is
    powerful and I could say better than any other Kindle-like platform. My Kindle
    is always in good care, recently I bought customize cases from <a href=http://www.kekacase.com/design-your-own/kindle-cases.html
    rel=dofollow>http://www.kekacase.com/design-your-own/kindle-cases.html</a>, and
    turns out all good.
