  some features of Avant Garde Gothic Condensed but some characters are obviously
  different. Works I found are by Werkplaats students exclusively, so it may actually
  be an unreleased font... Please help! Thanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wt_3815.jpg]"

    is most likely custom. And there\u2019s more than 1 style: \u2018Deutschland im
    Herbst\u2019 started out as Helvetica. The \u2018M\u2019 in \u2018Dramlet\u2019
    looks DIN-ish. The \u2018C\u2019 is closer to Neuzeit Grotesk than Avant Garde
    Gothic. It\u2019s a complete sm\xF6rg\xE5sbord."

  body: "hmm Ive been trying to get hold of a variation of  otik used in this poster\r\n\r\nhttp://www.deappel.nl/exhibitions/e/689/1/2/\r\n\r\nI
    emailed the designer, felix weigand, but had no reply.\r\n\r\nany suggestions?!
    have also emailed karl Nawrot to confirm the name of the font but I dont know
    if it is too much to ask if I can buy/download the font directly from him? feels
    like it might be overstepping the mark a bit! \r\n\r\npavels and florian-maybe
    the werkplatz students/alumni only circulate the font between themselves? Nawrot
    has designed a few typefaces that I would love to get my hands on but get the
    feeling he only shares with his peers!\r\n\r\n"
