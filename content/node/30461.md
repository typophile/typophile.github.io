  any sources of inspiration? Labels that make you go \u201CWow!\u201D. Books, Web
  sites?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking for inspiration. I\u2019m desperate.\r\n\r\nThis
  will be my first time. After years of mediocre design for undeserving clients and
  design agencies, I am now crippled with stunted typographic skills.\r\n\r\nPS\u2014I
  live in Ireland, so I can\u2019t visit the local <em>Safeway</em> to look at labels
  on the shelves if you are directing me to American brands.\r\n\r\nJC\r\n"

  body: "Dear Cordovez. If you still have not found a solution, how about calligraphy?
    Type is static by comparison and usually dej\xE0 vu as well. Handwriting done
    by a professional calligrapher like myself can infuse alphabetic communication
    with originality and a freshness that type can never match. "

  body: "cordovez for a Wow factor, try to highten the senses. Bold sensual product
    represnetation with strong clean type. \r\nAs for colour schemes I'm almost of
    two minds, but try to stay within an analogous colour palette, with labels and
    type in monochrome (you might try using tight lines of gold or other earth metal
    tones to highten a black or white label).\r\n\r\nBut hey, bold warm colour product
    palette with a pop of complementary hue 'may' have a chance, but I'd be real careful
    with that application.\r\n\r\nWhat's the form of the product containers? And what's
    the income bracket your client wants to attract?\r\n\r\n__________\r\nHiro "
