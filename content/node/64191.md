  signing with them), but \u2013 greedy me \u2013 if you want to get this font right
  now, send me an e-mail. I've sent the signed contracts to FontShop, so Suomi Hand
  should be available in within a month or so. \r\n\r\nSo, Mike Diaz, you do in fact
  have a chance to have this font; Lumene company went from advertising company to
  another for some two years, micro-managing their tag line from \"The Secret of Nordic
  Beauty to \"The Secret of Nordic Nature\", and never implemented the Lumene font,
  so I got fustrated, and re-draw the whole font, and re-named it Suomi Hand. It was
  used in a charity event, and I promtly got an e-mail from Lumene company complaining
  inappropriate use of their font, but I just told them to check their lisence agreement
  that has a three year exclusive right, and also pointed, that I've in fact re-drawn
  the glyps. (Just to be sure.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SuomiHand_5834.png]\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hello, Hrant. I'm not sure what you meant by your question, but if you refer
    to the Lumene deal, I never signed any formal contract with them, only sent the
    EULA with the font, which agreed to three years exclusive use to Lumene. That
    was in 2004.

  body: "Hrant, I can guess what your question is aiming at.\r\n\r\nA foundry can
    sell their fonts through different channels, FontShop USA being one of these channels.
    Those distribution contracts are usually non-exclusive, that means the foundry
    still can sell their fonts through other distributors, like MyFonts or their own
    foundry website.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a designer submits his work to a
    foundry to get his fonts to the market, the foundry usually gets the exclusive
    distribution rights to the fonts (but could, as above, use different channels
    for distribution)."
