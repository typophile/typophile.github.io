  body: The difference between a slab and a serif can sometimes be quite subjective.
    In TheSerif's case i'd definitely say slab given the shape of the serifs. I believe
    the name comes from the fact that it has serifs of any sort, and they just happen
    to be slab serifs. TheAntiqua is the true oldstyle serif in the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/super_families/thesis/">Thesis</a>
    family.
