  body: "Just curious... why is the client so picky with a Swiss designer/design company?
    It seems a bit old fashioned these days with Internet and all modern technology.
    I was commissioned by  Jura (a Swiss company) to make extensions for Stalemate
    which they had chosen as part of there graphic identity. It worked very smooth
    and easy.\r\n\r\nAnyway good luck."

  body: "Stefan, why should supporting local business (or locally-rooted designers)
    necessarily be \"old-fashioned\"? Especially in a field like design, which potentially
    needs to be able to factor in local design traditions / cultural backgrounds.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Roland, thanks for the vote of confidence; committed I am, but also still a beginner.
    Plus you shouldn't be too silent about your own work, either!"

    normally I would agree with your comments, but on this particular occassion, the
    Swiss client of the Swiss company wants to be able to use the story of the creation
    of a new corporate font to add a little local colour to the rebranding exercise.
    And as we all know 'the client is always right\u2026'"

  body: The client is considering a couple of foundries that are not based in Switzerland
    so not breaking EU rules. He just wanted the option of being able to use a Swiss
    based foundry / type designer.
