  \"Medium\", broadcast in the US.  I've tried to get a sample, but for some reason
  I can not create a registered account on CBS web site. Other attempts to get a sample,
  are from countries other then the US and the font a different.  The font in question
  appears to be Celtic, with dropped caps.  Can anyone help??\r\n\r\ng\r\n\r\n"

    and the font in question, with upper & lower case. The cap's drop below the baseline.
    Your sample does have similarities.  The cap \"D\", in the screen credits is very
    distinctive. Celtic, most likely But calligraphy/brush stroke characteristics.
    What is the font you presented???\r\n\r\nAgain thinks for your help\r\n\r\ngary"

    Maybe Mr. Beavis is one of the 52.7 percent\xB9 of computer users who already
    have it installed or on their Office install disk. In which case he doesn't need
    to.\r\n\r\n\xB9 Wild but educated guess"

    boot \"Windows\".  But the frustration make me want to pull my hair out. Guess
    that's a factor in my baldness\r\n\r\nAlso, concerning the font in question, I
    have come to the conclusion  that it is not Tempus Sans. I captured an image of
    the font off a DVD and while there are a few similarities I have to continue looking.
    \ Is there a way to include  Jpg file in my post.  I'll include my email address
    if anyone is interested in continue the search.  I can atleast reply with the
