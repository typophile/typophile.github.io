  target="_blank"> The Gas Company Tower</a> in Los Angeles.  It should be a full
  typeface since it is also used on the Parking sign.  It might be proprietary, though.
  <BR> <BR>My apologies for not posting an image in the thread, but the person wants
  $240 for using that crappy snapshot.  I&#39;ll try to remember to bring my digital
  camera next time I go for a walk and I&#39;ll take a better picture. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: Stephen, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help!  I love that font... every time I walk
    past the Gas Company Tower I stop for a while to admire the font.  I usually buy
    fonts from MyFonts, but I created an account at FontShop and purchased it &#40;URW
    Topic Bold&#41; from there as thanks for all your help.  It is a wonderful typeface,
    and I bet I&#39;ll find a use for it! <BR> <BR>Thanks again!

  body: 'James, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the link!  That was interesting information indeed...
    the font is a little bit older than I thought. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t ask for permission
    to post the image, since I only kinked to it.  Here&#39;s what it said on the
    page: <BR><i>&#34;The image above is for internet viewing only, and may not be
    saved outside your browser or used without a license. However, you can buy usage
    rights if the image belongs to our staff.&#34;</i> <BR> <BR>And if you look around
    the site you see that the price for that piece of &#34;stock&#34; is $240.  So
    I didn&#39;t want to post the image here and be in violation of their copyright.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks!'

    <BR>Thank you Lauri. That means a lot. <BR> <BR>May I ask what features you&#39;d
    like to see at FontShop.com that  <BR>would help bring us to the top of your list?

  body: 'Stephen, <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s some points: <BR> <BR>&#42; I hope I don&#39;t
    sound too cheap, but fonts seem to often cost a little bit less at MyFonts.  If
    a font is $22 at FontShop it is often $21 at MyFonts. <BR> <BR>&#42; Accept PayPal.  It&#39;s
    nice to buy a font once in a while when I have money laying around in my PayPal
    account. <BR> <BR>These seem to be the two main reasons for me.  But I&#39;ll
    be using FontShop more in the future. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s what FontShop does better
    than MyFonts: <BR> <BR>&#42; The new testdrive is awesome!  Up to 388pt in size.  I
    haven&#39;t seen that anywhere before... now you get to see the small details.  It&#39;d
    be a nice added feature if you could enter the point size yourself.  And maybe
    for a future testdrive have an &#34;advanced&#34; link where you could test drive
    OpenType functions for the font. <BR> <BR>&#42; The design of the site is a lot
    nicer than MyFonts, which is a little bit too cartoony for my taste.  Professionalism
    goes a long way. <BR> <BR>&#42; Free font of the month.  I love this feature...
    and makes me come back to the site.  FF Absara is really great, and I&#39;m doing
    to use that in some project in the future so I could buy some more weights. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; You!  I don&#39;t see anybody from MyFonts identifying fonts and helping
    out in here. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s all I can think of at the moment.  I&#39;ll add
    more points if I think of something more. <BR> <BR>Thanks!'

    <BR>This is actually possible already by &#34;hacking&#34; the URL. After  <BR>running
    a custom sample, just change the very last number of  <BR>the address in your
    browser to whatever point size you desire. <BR>&#40;The renderer can actually
    churn out samples above 388 pt. Shhh.&#41; <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>improve

    sort of advanced search isn&#39;t enabled at all right now <BR>while the people
    behind the curtain tinker with the keyword cogs. <BR>We shall enable it soon and
    I think you&#39;ll be very pleased with it.
