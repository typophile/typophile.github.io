  will really appreciate if you guys can please find some time to critique the typeface.\r\ni
  want to work this typeface both in body text and display too. \r\nThis is my first
  attempt to design a serif typeface.\r\nYour comments are really valuable to me and
  will help me to improve in future. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\nRony\r\n   "

    feed back:\r\n* Very Iinteresting design style:\r\n with typical pointed endings
    in a,c,e & s.\r\n Visble heavy sress stokes especially vertical ones.\r\n Clear
    capsule shape counter forms.\r\n Condense character widths.\r\n\r\nFew corrections
    to be considered:\r\n* y stand out with right side heavy sroke, normally it is
    left one.\r\n* v,w,x & z do not reflect the style atall.\r\n* z is bit wider in
    width and upper stoke goes out to left and creats balance problem.\r\n* the conclave
    curve serifs at the baseline does not reflect on descenders, p, q, & y.\r\n\r\nRegrds,\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This looks like an interesting start. Here are a couple of thoughts.\r\n\r\n-
    Most of your glyphs look quite \"constructed\", like you were fusing them up from
    different parts that you were copy-pasting between letters. That means that most
    of them will need a bit of optical correction. For example, in the bpdq (and others),
    there is a little bump where the curve \"becomes straight\". These things need
    to be optically tweaked, away from pure geometry, in order to look right. Also
    look at the overall proportions, like why is the \"e\" so much narrower than the
    \"o\"?\r\nMind that if you really want to make it work for text, that's going
    to take even more optical correction, and lots of testing. It might be easier
    to first shoot for display, where it's more permissible to stick closer to geometry.\r\n\r\n-
    I like your curvy/tapering terminals on things like \"c\", \"s\", \"a\". In fact,
    I think the \"a\" is my favorite glyph. It's really quite nice.\r\n\r\n- The two-sided
    x-line serifs \u2013 on \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\" \u2013 are much thinner than
    the other ones. Actually, on the \"x\" the baseline serifs are also thin. I think
    I'd make them thicker to match all the other ones.\r\n\r\n- \"k\": the (upper)
    arm looks heavier than the leg. It should be the other way round.\r\n\r\n- \"o\"
    seems to have stronger contrast between thick and thin than the other letters.\r\n\r\n-
    The tail of the \"g\" has a similar problem. Best idea is probably to look at
    lots and lots of \"g\"s and figure out where the most weight should be. Also,
    that ear is too small.\r\nOn the other hand, have you tried making a single-storey
    \"g\"? Kind of like the \"q\" with the descender curving over to the left. It
    could work quite well in this font I think.\r\n\r\nKeep going! :-)"
