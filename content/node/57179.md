  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dot_3781.JPG]\r\nStart with Commercial
    Script, fatten it up a little, and put a bulge on the end of the swash on <strong>D</strong>.
    Modify the join between <strong>o</strong> and <strong>t</strong>, and move the
    crossbar on <strong>t</strong> a little. That should get you pretty close."
