  i will go for the Garamond.. but what can i use for headlines? i wanted something
  like Fontbureaus Interstate...   <BR>Anybody have a nice suggestion that would work

  body: Maybe one of the MS web fonts? Trebuchet/Tahoma? I&#39;ve been using Bitstream&#39;s
    opensource Vera on a few projects as well. <BR> <BR>Nothing as nice or versatile
    as Interstate, but if that&#39;s all you have to work with...

  body: If you are working with Garamond, particularly for authors, why not do it
    all in Garamond? It has more than enough variations to do any job required of
    copy.

  body: Jack -- If you were working in the USA, it would be more difficult to convince
    others that it could be done with one typeface family. I think the advantage to
    Garamond would be your ability to squeeze long headlines into narrow measures
    by using its various bold condensed family members. Of course, it might be too
    restrained to use only one typeface family for sensational journalism, where the
    eye-chart style of typography sets the pace. Now, how do I put in one of those
    smileys?

  body: Windows XP also comes with News Gothic and maybe Franklin Gothic. These may
    work nicely. <BR> <BR>FYI, I&#39;ve purchased CorelDraw at around $290 and it
    comes with a nice collection of Bitstream fonts. I think that same Bitstream collection
    is available separately as well. Check bitstream.com if you&#39;re interested.
