body: Anyone know what the spanish retailer Zara font is? (www.zara.com)I thought
  it to be a form of Clarendon...and maybe even closer with Whitman...but cannot find
  a similar font anywhere that matches the "flattened" R and pin-straight descenders.
  thanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zaralogo_03_5490.jpg]

  body: thanks, Bald Condensed. You're probably right...i was wondering the same thing.
    it's beautiful, though. elegant, commanding, & yet quirky...

  body: "Wow, just stumbled across a spread of \"John Hancock Extended\" in the 1923
    ATF Specimen Book and thought of this thread. Pages 216-217. I'll try to get you
    a scan, but it's very close to what was probably Zara's custom logotype. All I've
    been able to find is a digitized condensed \"Hancock\" from Red Rooster, on MyFonts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
