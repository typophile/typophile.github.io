  said it was the closest but I thought maybe some of the typophiles here could find
  an even closer match.\r\n\r\nHere's the back cover of the 2001 special edition (rather
  than the original vinyl, which I have a feeling was hand lettered)\r\n\r\nhttp://images.coveralia.com/audio/m/Michael_Jackson-Thriller_%28Special_Edition%29-Trasera.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
  original vinyl looks like this:\r\nhttp://imgs.inkfrog.com/pix/UncleDearest/Thriller_LP_back_cover.jpg\r\n\r\nIs
  it rage? is there a better match?"

  body: "The top sample matches 'Rage Italic' with some 'interesting' twists. Look
    at  the \"I\" in song 3... that's actually a \"1\". (Same applies throughout)\r\n\r\nMost
    curious is the \"f\" in \"Voice-Over Session from Thriller\". I can't find that
    glyph anywhere in Rage Italic.\r\n\r\nThe original vinyl is hand lettering all
    the way... and very nice at that."

    Script]] is a free font that's similar.  I think it was probably based on whatever
    was used on the CD cover.\r\n"

    that mean your sample (above) was made with your copy of FreshScript?\r\n\r\n-

  body: '@ Mike: No, the sample I provided is a closer look at the actual Thriller
    CD image. As indicated the "I" and "F" match Fresh Script and not Rage Italic.
    The Fresh Script font info was an attempt to figure out when it was made and by
    whom.'

  body: "Not so fast...\r\n\r\nAfter another examination 'minimalista' is on to something,
    as 'Fresh Script' has an \"I\" and \"F\" that now match exactly. The \"i\", \"y\",
    \"M\" and \"N\", which I missed the first time, are also a match to Fresh Script.
    Consider that about 125% horizontal scale was added.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Thriller-CD_5070.jpg]\r\n\r\nFresh
    Script Sample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Freshscript-Sample_4983.gif]\r\n\r\nRage
    Italic Sample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rage-Italic-Sample_5151.gif]\r\n\r\nFresh
    Script is likely a knockoff off of Rage Italic, but it's a much closer match to
    the one used in the Thriller CD cover sample.\r\n\r\nEdit: The Fresh Script font
    info shows it was most likely created after Rage Italic, which appears to have
    been digitized by Esselte Letraset Limited in 1991.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fresh-Script_5501.gif]"

  body: Alright, looks like it's Fresh Script for the win (at least for the Special
    Edition, and with 125% horizontal scale). Cheers guys!
