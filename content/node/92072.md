  font (NOT such a comic font) that is very readable on little formats.\r\nTo simulate
  a sense of  handwriting, it has to be a flipper font.\r\nI want to look if it is
  possible to combine, and how far it is possible to go with.\r\n\r\nI thought I was
  smart enough to figure out how it had to be done in FontLab\r\nbut thanks to my
  limited knowledge of the English language, I'm not.\r\nAlso I have only a limited
  knowledge of FontLab, my previous fonts were without programming Python.\r\n(I actually
  know FontLab only one year now, and on school the specialization Typography is in
  its childhood,\r\nnot a lot of people know FontLab in detail)\r\n\r\nI'm very interested
  in this part of fonts, but it would be stupid having to learn Python for one exercise,\r\nI
  can better learn it later when I have more time.\r\nSo my question is; can someone
  provide a step by step way how to create flipper fonts in FontLab?\r\nStarting with
  how to create multiple versions of one glyph (and the correct name it has to be
  given),\r\nover how to write and insert the Python code,\r\nand if needed, how to
  export it the correct way.\r\n\r\nI have found the code, but don't know how to implement
  it.\r\nfeature salt {\r\nlookup rotate {\r\nsub @set_1 @set_1' by @set_2;\r\nsub
  @set_2 @set_1' by @set_3;\r\nsub @set_3 @set_1' by @set_4;\r\nsub @set_4 @set_1'
  by @set_5;\r\nsub @set_5 @set_1' by @set_1;\r\n} rotate;\r\nlookup rotate;\r\n}
  salt;\r\n\r\nI have done a search around, but couldn't find something easy;\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/19625\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/43634\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/13315\r\nEven
  Google didn't give an easy answer.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry my first post has to be such
  an stupid easy thing, but so it be.\r\nI think Typophile is the best place to ask
  this,\r\nhere I have found already a lot of information about font designing problems
  in the past.\r\nI'm glad if someone could tell me.\r\nMaarten."

    sometimes the best way to get the ball rolling is to say something that someone
    else will feel obliged to correct. So...\r\n\r\nTo make the code you show work,
    you have to create sets_1 through 5, then define them in the bottom right-hand
    frame of the OpenType panel in FontLab\u2014for example,\r\n\r\n@set_1=[ a b c
    d e \u2026];\r\n@set_2=[ a.2 b.2. c.2 d.2 e.2 \u2026 ];\r\nand so on\u2026\r\n\r\nOr
    so I believe; correctives will follow as needed\u2026"
