  body: and they are all conveniently hidden by being anonymous ... noticed my article
    was linked to it though ... that is kinda hopeful ... it is insane really ...
    a lot of confusion in the article ... i want to respond, and i will ... just need
    time ... in the meantime you should post ... i wish Zuzana would post ... Emigre&#39;s
    EULA is actually one of the most &#34;user-friendly&#34; ... makes me angry as
    well, from a designer&#39;s pov ... here i am trying to get foundries to trust
    us &#40;designers&#41; and yet these people are only proving the point that designer&#39;s
    can&#39;t be trusted. AGH!

    rather think that: <BR>1&#41; Ignorants shouldn&#39;t be looked down upon. <BR>2&#41;
    Primadonnas shouldn&#39;t be humored. <BR> <BR>The point isn&#39;t to condemn
    the masses, it&#39;s to <i>assimilate</i> their stance. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Perhaps educating Ed Foster would be a start - seems as if he might be someone
    who could be helpful in the crusade against badly written font EULAs. But enlisting
    his help, without making the &#39;industry&#39; look bad would be tricky.  <BR>
    <BR>If he reads the comments there&#39;s some hope of a follow up article.  <BR>

    to me the primary purpose should be to improve <i>yourself</i>, not preach or
