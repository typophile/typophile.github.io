  body: "Yeah, I think it works. Feminine, and especially pregnant feminine, forms.
    Nice job. I wonder if the colour is a bit slight. And I also wonder whether there
    should be at least one connex b/w the strokes (I reckon the middle of the 'B')
    to add a bit of tension, to make it look more spontaneous and less thinky (if
    that makes sense),\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n-N"

  body: "the strokes aren't quite clean enough or aren't quite organic enough. They're
    in limbo and seem to be a mistake at the moment. I'd push them one way or the
    other.\r\n\r\nThe logo is nice, conceptually. Well done.\r\n\r\nThe type is lacking,
    though, and is way out of scale with the mark. "

  body: "Yep, clean up the curves and you've got a nice logo. Have you thought about
    adding a belly button? ;)\r\n\r\nI agree with Nick's comment about connecting
    the middle of the B. Your stroke widths seem a little uneven.\r\n\r\nAs for the
    type, I would make the logo a bit smaller so the type stands out more.\r\n\r\n-Scott"

  body: thx for feedback - I'm working on the type, darkening the palette + will clean
    up the curves so its not ambiguous. pls stay tuned, I'll post some revisions.
