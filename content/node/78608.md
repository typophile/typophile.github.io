body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI am wondering whether there is a good way to access \"Stylistic
  Sets\" in Illustrator when using OT fonts? As of now, i have to manually replace
  characters using the Glyph palette or use Indesign to set the text and then import
  into Illustrator. Not ideal.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSeb"

    know that has not been changed in CS5

  body: I get a kick out of the Adobe video for OpenType. They make it sound like
    OpenType is seamless across all their applications. No mention of any lack of
    feature support in Illustrator or even the lack of a glyph palette in Photoshop.
    I'm guessing that makes it more likely that designers will need the entire suite.
