body: I'm currently working on a thesis that discusses the impact of late twentieth-century
  technology on the proliferation of typefaces. It would be a great help if you would
  comment your opinion whether type design programmes, such as Opentype have had a
  positive or negative impact on the quality of typefaces designed over the past few
  years.

  body: "Sorry to nit-pick, but proliferation and quality are different things. Also
    you ask about the impact of late 20th century technology, but most fonts made
    in the \"past few years\" were made using 21st century technology. \r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si"

    sense.\r\n\r\nRather than get bogged down in issues of \u201Cquality\u201D, whatever
    that means, start by putting together a history of font production in the digital
    era, attempting to identify the different phases it has been through.\r\n\r\nThis
    will get you off and running:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Inside-Publishing-Revolution-Adobe-Story/dp/0321115643\r\n\r\nThere
    have been certain sea changes, such as the release of Fontographer in 1986, the
    replacement of direct mail trade advertising of fonts on floppies by e-commerce,
    c.2000, and more recently the introduction of @fontface, which has proliferated
    webfonts from the handful of Microsoft Core TrueType Web Fonts (Georgia, Verdana,
    Comic Sans etc.) \r\n\r\nIMO, people\u2019s opinions on what are the sigini\uFB01cant
    historical events would be more productive than their opinions on whether more
    designers publishing more fonts is good or bad.\r\n\r\nBut in answer to that question,
    it is what it is."

  body: "As the others have said, this is a bit of a confused question. What do you
    mean by 'proliferation'? The digital environment has put typefaces in the hands
    of everyone who owns a computer, so in that sense they're much more widespread
    than metal type ever was. Or do you mean digital fonts' copyability in users'
    hands? Or the ease of availability online through foundries' distribution channels?\r\n\r\nOpenType
    is not really a 'type design programme', rather a file format that puts the typeface
    on screen when you key characters. The quality of typefaces is more to do with
    the experience of the designer and production team. Type design software like
    FontLab or Glyphs, like any tool, can be used badly or well. "

  body: "Now that anyone with a computer can make a TTF or OTF font for a new typeface,
    whereas in the past one would have had to mold lead type, create a Monotype matrix-case,
    or a comb of Linotype circulating slugs, I think you can be highly secure in the
    conclusion that current technology is contributing to a proliferation of typefaces.\r\n\r\nThe
    only interesting question is whether the photo-typesetting era was much of an
    intermediate between these two."

  body: "I think people are being a bit harsh on the questioner, in this thread and
    the other. It's a perfectly reasonable question if you break it down.\r\n\r\nType
    200 years ago was (more or less) hand-cut and hand-set, 100 years ago machine-cutting
    and linotype/monotype machines were used, 35 years ago it was photolettering.
    Today, we've got digital typefaces in formats like OpenType and TrueType. Each
    of these changes has had a significant impact on the way type is used. This is
    extremely basic stuff, of course.\r\n\r\nWhat's really made this last change different
    from the others is that (a) a vastly bigger amount of people are now able to use
    fonts than ever before, and (b) the tools used to design, manufacture and distribute
    fonts are now immeasurably cheaper. This has led to more fonts being produced
    today, as well as indeed proliferated, than at any previous point in history.\r\n\r\nNow,
    the question is: what aesthetic impact has this transformation had? It's really
    the equivalent of queries from previous eras: Is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message|the
    medium the message]]? [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction|What
    happens to the work of art in the age of mechanical reporduction]]? How has post-modern
    [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDE4VX_9Kk|ways of seeing]] impacted our understanding
    of art? And so on. \r\n\r\nThe trivial answer to this question, that we're now
    seeing more \"bad\" amateur fonts than ever before, as well as a great dela many
    more professional-quality fonts than ever before, is uninteresting, however. It
    needs to be taken futher."

    1800s photography was done mostly by professionals, but today with cell phones
    everyone has a camera in their pocket. A few decades ago graphic design involved
    ordering type, pasting up layouts with a t-square and X-Acto knife, etc, but now
    anyone with a computer can try page layout. Journalism used to involve getting
    hired and having editors review your work, but now anyone can set up a website
    and post articles and news.\r\n\r\nThere are many similar examples in other professions
    and the results are what you'd expect \u2014 it's great that people have access
    to these tools, but the results are often amateurish."

  body: "Certainly, but in some professions at least \u2013 I can't speak for graphic
    design \u2013 the ability for more people to have access to technology has also
    allowed for a lot more quality product to come through, from unexpected places
    and with radically changed content.  Music is the classic example, of course,
    where recording, distribution and (some) instrument technology has constantly
    become cheaper, and each new change (like the proliferation of the electronic
    microphone in the 20s, or the significant increase in the number of recording
    channels available in the 70s, to take two random examples) has added new tools
    and brough new people into the cultural form, creating new angles and perspectives
    and styles. That a relatively poor country like Jamaica has had the innovative
    impact on generations of music that it has, is strongly correlated with the availability
    and cost of various technologies at various times.\r\n\r\nI've got a significant
    interest in African music and arts, and there's a perfect example there in the
    way music videos have changed: HD digital cameras and processing technology has
    gone from unavailable to common in around five years. And in that same time time
    a staggering change has taken place in the artistic ambition and visual complexity
    of the videos accross the whole continent, from [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6L3tOU4PTI|amateurish
    green-screen nonsense]] to [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_bq1F9hV8g|highly
    ambitious aesthetic concept videos]].  And of course the two are highly correlated,
    no matter how much new mediocre stuff is also bein made!\r\n\r\nHave we seen a
    smilar change in type? If not, why not? Where are the African type houses? (The
    South American ones are obviously doing fine.)"

    in any field is, well, amateurish, but sometimes modern technology gives talented
    individuals opportunities that didn't exist previously, which is a good thing."
