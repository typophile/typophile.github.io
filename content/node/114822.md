  body: "In a way, I think you answered your own question. I think this is a customized/re-drawn/modernized
    version of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/block-bq/?refby=bowfin|Berthold
    Block]]. The artist changed the a, e, g and c, and made the rest of the lettering
    look cleaner than the original. I could not find this as a font. If the record
    album was early 80's this might have been film type or hand lettered.\r\n\r\n-
