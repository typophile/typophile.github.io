  body: It looks familiar -- kind of T-26ish, but I didn&#39;t see it among MyFonts&#39;
    T26 collection &#40;I&#39;m beginning to refuse to actually visit the T26 site&#41;.
    I&#39;m sure someone else here must know it -- it looks like Bank Gothic&#39;s
    hipster cousin.

  body: t-26 was my first thought as well. i made some sort of attempt to slog <BR>through
    &#40;they say they have no sans faces&#41;, but got nothing. this might <BR>be
    the display face used in espn the magazine.

    <BR>alpha headline &#40;1 weight&#41; <BR>designed by cornel windlin, 1993-1997
    <BR> <BR>&#34;alpha headline&#34; is derived from the standard british car registration
    plates. the first version dates back to 1991. it was subsequently used on a number
    of design projects and presented at the FUSE &#39;94 conference in london. &#34;alpha&#34;
    served as a headline typeface for phil bicker&#39;s redesign of &#34;creative
    camera&#34;. at present it exists in a capitals only version, with two alternative
    sets of characters within the same font. '

  body: The sample is small, but it looks like the flared A used here is from the
    upper set of characters, and the large one on the specimen is from the lower set.
    &#40;Note the R with flare on top and without on bottom.&#41;

  body: Isn&#39;t it possible the different &#34;A&#34; is somewhere in the &#34;two
    alternative sets of characters within the same font&#34;? The full character set
    is displayed too small to clearly distinguish the individual shapes on my screen.

    not for sale right now, Wilson. Maybe there <BR>were IP issues with the British
