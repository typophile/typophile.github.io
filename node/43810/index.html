But concerning the historical facts which went into it (of course there is some fiction as well as not everything could be said with absolute certainty): here the author talked about a lot e.g. with Max Caflisch, a renowned writer of typographic history essays. Caflisch writes about Augereau and de Colines in his book "Schriftanalysen 1" and here there should be examples, too.

Vervliet has published illustrated essays on the work of all the major French punchcutters of the 16th century during the last decade or so.  The most recent was, ‘The young Garamont: roman types made in Paris from 1530 to 1540’, <em>Typography papers</em>, 7 (Hyphen Press, London, 2007), pp. 5-60. They are scattered in various journals, so it’s good to know that he promises a collected edition of them. He has also made a ‘Conspectus’ which will be an illustrated guide to the whole scene.

Simon de Colines. An Annotated Catalogue of 230 Examples of his Press, 1520-1546. by Fred Schreiber

would give you some interesting information.  In a review of it that appeared in <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0034-4338%28199723%2950%3A3%3C920%3ASDCAAC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-L" target="_blank"><em>Renaissance Quarterly</em>, Vol. 50, No. 3. (Autumn, 1997), pp. 920-921.</a> one reads

<dl>
<dd>
De Colines was a type designer and punchcutter before he was a printer, and his achievements in the field of typography form one of the singular contributions of this catalogue. Schreiber traces the printer's introduction of the first accented Greek type in France; an outstanding cursive typeface based on Arrighi's designs: and an italic derived from Aldus Manutius's italic. De Colines designed and cut these new typefaces within the first ten years of producing his first book and launching his very successful printing career. In addition to documenting the printer's typographical triumphs, this catalogue also features discussion of his use of borders and ornaments.

It seems that Augereau was active much later, from 1532 to 1534. Garamond learned from Augereau. Could the font be from de Colines himself?

In 1520, Simon de Colines married the widow of Robert's brother, Henri Ier Estienne, also a printer. Peignot does not mention that de Colines was Henri's associate.

That’s inevitable. The more closely you look at any busy scene, the more complicated it becomes, and the more myths accumulate. The name of Garamond (or Garamont if you prefer) is thick with them. But what is extraordinary is how much more is now known with some certainty about about the types being made in France during the period 1520 to 1550, when Paris and Lyon were among the greatest European centres of printing, compared with what was generally available when Updike first published in 1922, and how many of the original documents on which existing histories are based at second or third hand still survive and have now been published. 

That date of 1510 for Garamond’s apprenticeship to Augereau, which has been around since the 18th century, is based on the reminiscences of a member of the Le Bé family, punchcutters and typefounders. If it is to be believed at all, it makes more sense to take it, as Vervliet suggests (in his piece in <em>Typography Papers, 2007</em>), as the date of his birth. Then other events fall into a more believable pattern. Learning punchcutting in his twenties from Augereau, who is burned in 1534 for heresy. Then working for another punchcutter, Pierre Haultin, and for printers in Paris during the later 1530s. And finally a certain date, the contract for the royal Greek types for Robert Estienne, in 1540. To get that job, he must have by then have shown he could do good work.

More than one punchcutter was making types based directly on the <em>De Aetna</em> of Aldus in Paris around 1530, and these types are the models for the classic ‘Garamond’ style. Augereau is one of them. Among the other candidates are Francis Gryphius. And Constantin (whose first name we don’t know). Who? Read Vervliet. Colines never quite took to this new model.

And as for what we think we do now know about Garamond, look at John Lane’s scrupulously researched and well-illustrated essay in the handsome specimen printed in 2005 to launch Adobe’s Garamond Premier Pro. If copies are still around, perhaps you can get it if you buy the font. But by now maybe Adobe could consider putting a version on line? It would be appreciated.

Indeed. Thanks. Vevliet's paper covers the period 1530&ndash;1540. Is there any reference on punchcutting in France coverning the period 1515&ndash;1525 (before Garamond) ? The book above was published in 1521.</div>

And there are some others that go back to the early years of the century.

Maybe it will be helpful to list the titles I know. It is not easy to find them in so many different books and journals, even if you can get to a library that has them, so the collected edition and the conspectus, when they appear (soon, I hope) will make the information easier to get at. But it is there now, if you look it up.
