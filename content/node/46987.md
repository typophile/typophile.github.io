  body: "I thought this may have the look of a freebie techno design, in the popular
    Bauhaus-ish genre. I set the word 'Inventec' as the sample text and scanned through
    the Techno>Sci-Fi and >Various categories at Dafont and came up with a similar
    font called [[http://www.dafont.com/rezland.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Inventec|Rezland]]
    by Fraser Davidson.\r\n\r\nIt's not exact, but maybe some tweaking can get you
    close enough.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
