body: "Hi all. As I mentioned in a post in the General Discussions section, I've designed
  an upper case typeface as the first project of Kris Sowersby's pilot Typeface Design
  paper at Massey University. This was a 5 week project so it's not perfect, and we
  were required to only design glyphs A though Z and concern ourselves only with metrics
  to space the letters between HHxHHOOxOO, no kerning (big can of worms apparently!).\r\n\r\nThe
  second project is to design a lower case typeface, either based on our upper case
  or something entirely different. I want to base mine on my upper case, and am keen
  for some ideas from you guys on where I could go with it, example typefaces and
  the like. Any feedback on my upper case would be great too \u2013 I'm all for making
  more improvements.\r\n\r\nFor context: I really love Futura, but lately I have been
  getting used to softer typefaces with a similar feel like Myriad and even Avenir.
  So, with this project my aim was to create a 'softer Futura' in a way. I decided
  to create a heavy/bold weight with tight spacing to be used for headlines/display.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n"

  body: Well, the curves in the UC chars are quite humanistic I think, so something
    in the line of Myriad (or Frutiger) would probably be appropriate. A 'softer'
    Futura? A humanistic futura? :)

  body: "Thanks Quincunx, Myriad and Frutiger are what I've been looking at basing
    it on \u2013 looks like I'm on the right track :) I'd like to see how well it
    goes with a little less stroke variation more like Futura, and perhaps implementing
    some of the character of Myriad's italic forms which I had very subtly put into
    my upper case (top of the B, P, R, D). \r\n\r\nAny other ideas? More obscure fonts
    that I could look at?"

    to get some feedback from you guys along the way.

  body: "I would love to see one with the x height of Avenir or even better Gotham.
    I'm not a big fan of the long ascenders and descenders in Avenir. Also I would
    love for someone to go out of the box on some of the characters like the lowercase
    a and g. Go in the direction of Avenir or Gotham rather than Univers on the lowercase
    u and I tend to prefer squares rather than dots on the i and j (see Gotham)\r\n\r\nI'm
    just talking about what I would like to see in a typeface like this and merely
    making suggestions;o)\r\n\r\nOn the Uppercase: This sort of Q tends to become
    really heavy at the bottom optically and could possibly be solved better. Again
    try something original after all you are competing with the likes of Adrian Frutiger
    and Tobias Frere Jones here;o) Make sure you have something different to offer.\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck and great job so far!"

  body: "Thanks Endre. I've just been looking around for some typefaces that match
    my intentions and did spot Gotham which I really like, so it's interesting that
    you also mentioned it. I'm looking forward to the LC, as Kris said it's tougher
    than UC but much more fun. I hope to inject a bit of character into it, especially
    looking at the 'a' and 'g' but I don't want to bite off more than I can chew for
    this 6 week, very part-time, project!\r\n\r\nRegarding the upper case, I just
    got my mark back from Kris. A+. I'm stoked!\r\nHe's never mentioned the Q, but
    that I should slightly broaden the joins on the V, W, N & M."

  body: "Congrats on your marks. Kris would not mark you down on the Q because there
    is nothing wrong with it. This is the way they were drawn back in the days. I'm
    purely talking about the next step in evolution if you know what I mean;-)\r\n\r\nI'm
    with Chris on his comments about the other characters though!\r\n\r\nYou should
    really not leave it as a part time project but continue on your own and develop
    this into a full face. If you make the changes before mentioned and ads some flare
    to it the face has great potential and I'm sure there are several designers out
    there who would love to see such a face."

  body: 'I like what you''ve done with your typeface. To my point of view there is
    one thing to fix is the tail or the end of those four letters : f, t, j an l.
    They seem to be not on the same typeface. I''d suggest to start with the f to
    adapt the curve to other three letters. Also, the S don''t really match the lc
    s. Keep going your good work. '
