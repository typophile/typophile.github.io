  on the subject ... but who and what? <BR> <BR>Nicolaj

  body: The best one is probably G W Ovink&#39;s &#34;Legibility, atmosphere-value
    and forms of printing types&#34; of 1938. The second section is about the &#34;impressions&#34;
    that fonts leave &#40;although culture has certainly changed since then&#41;.

    typography&#41; were posthumously exposed as bogus. And this was generally known
    towards the end of his life, but the English exercised typical proper decorum,

    about what associations various typographic attributes have, like narrow = feminine,

  body: Si, that BBC article reads more like the stuff of horoscopes -- hard to take
    too seriously. &#40;Then again, it&#39;s just the article and not the actual study.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t help thinking of color psychology as it may relate to the
    subjective area of type selection. Those color studies are interesting and have
    merit, but I rarely defer to them as &#39;truth.&#39; I would have to consider
    any psychology of typography study in the same way &#40;especially if it&#39;s
    as trite as the suggestion to &#34;use Courier for a resignation letter.&#34;&#41;
    <BR> <BR>For example, we&#39;ve been culturally trained to believe red is the
    color of love &#40;valentines day, roses&#41;. But color psychology suggests that
    blue is the color of love &#40;private, caring&#41; and that red is the color
    of power &#40;can&#39;t argue with that&#41;. We&#39;ve been culturally trained
    to recognize blue as corporate &#40;stable, trustworthy&#41;. We tend to think
    of yellow as bright or warm &#40;fresh or sunny&#41; while color psychology suggests
    yellow represents control or conflict. <BR> <BR>So, these readily contradict each
    other. Both of them may be right in their own way, in their own context. For me,
    the selection of color &#40;and type for that matter&#41; are all about the context
    and the audience.

  body: 'Type &amp; Layout: How typography and design can get your message across
    - or get in the way <BR>By Colin Wheildon  <BR> <BR>This is a recent work, very
    practical for art directors who are interested in getting the text read, rather
    than just looking good. <BR> <BR>Wheildon is an ad man, using direct marketing
    as his laboratory, just as the famous Claude Hopkins &#40;1910s&#41; and David
    Ogilvy &#40;1950s&#41; did before. What they would do is a split run, and vary
    one typographic feature between the two &#40;say do one half in serif face, and
    the other sans&#41; and see which got the better response. <BR> <BR>However Nikolaj,
    you seem to be interested in the emotional effects of typography. <BR>Usually,
    pyschologists and researchers such as Wheildon look at the mental mechanics of
    reading, in particular legibility and readability. <BR> <BR>And there&#39;s a
    reason for that. <BR>Any piece of typography has so many variables, that it would
    be impossible to isolate, in an experiment, the emotional effect of: <BR>-typeface
    <BR>-leading <BR>-alignment  <BR>-measure <BR>-size <BR>-page layout <BR>and of
    course there is the meaning of the text to consider. <BR> <BR>This is the preserve
    of art and design, not science. <BR> <BR>I feel your need. It seems that most
    writing about typefaces discusses: <BR>- historical reference <BR>- description
    of features/classification <BR>- technology <BR>- politics of design <BR>- cultural
    theory <BR>- readability/legibility <BR>- circumstance of its design process <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve written a lot about typefaces, but it&#39;s very analytical &#40;note
    my penchant for lists&#41;, and that seems to be the norm -- journalistic, commercial.
    So, which writers let the subject get under their skin? <BR> <BR>Jon Coltz, for
    one, at daidala.com <BR> <BR>Any other suggestions?'

    like Walbaum and Franklin Gothic in the 70s, iirc... I did a paper and a lecture
    on the emotional impact of typefaces as a sign of their time in the 90s, but its
    in German and thus not of much help :-&#41;

  body: Nicolaj... no problem, my text is public domain anyway. But please keep in
    mind that it is about 8 or so years old and that it isn&#39;t aimed at designers/typographers
    but at newcomers, as written &#40;at the time I was still studiying communication
    sciences&#41; by a newbie :-D Which is why it is not very up-to-date and looks
    darned amateurish. &#40;It was printed on DinA4 and cut to a slimmer size&#41;

  body: Testing the link, I noticed that it works better if you set Acrobat to show
    you the pages as spreads.  <BR> <BR>What the text completely lacks is my stance
    on curent design trends, from oliver vaughan to stefan sagmeister and my thesis
    that we live in an overdesigned, emotionally supercharged world in which emotion-by-design
    has become an all-too-important salesfactor and that as designers we have to ask
    ourselves if it is okay to be just another cog in the turbocapitalism machine,
    basically producing more literally waste and keeping a dying over-consumption-system
    artificially alive. In the 90s we were all happy for better and more design, currently
    I&#39;m not so sure anymore. Emotional design has become a manipulative tool in
    the wrong hands.  <BR> <BR>Errr, political ranting apart... I also have some english
    texts on emotional design, but they&#39;re rather focussed on product design and
    stuff like that. If you want, I can zip them and upload them on the server so
    you can download &#39;em.  <BR> <BR>

    design doesn&#39;t fulfill the promises made by the visuel style, shape and emotional
    effects. There are so many bad companies/products on the marked. Avoiding them
    is a idealistic lifetime work. Should designers lie or die ..? <BR> <BR>Nicolaj'

  body: 'It&#39;s not so much the bad company hing that iffs me, but that design --
    rather than complementing a good product -- has turned out to be a false promise
    in itself. We buy things because OF their emotional design, despite the fact that
    technically they may not even work as good as a less-overdesigned product &#40;take
    the Starck lemon-sueezwer or the Starck 1 wash-basin, take Ray Gun...&#41;. Also,
    I think that design has become THE most important marketing factor for products
    in an oversaturated market. Thus we have the 103rd detergent that is EXACTLY as
    good or bad as the other 102, yet it has a different design and thus feigns to
    be different. The same goes for any kind of product and many companies, generally.
    By this, we actively prolong a system, that in the end is anti-ecological and
    in many ways also economical nonsense. This, imo, is NOT what design is about.
    &#40;Although, of course nonsense is always cool... so... &#41; <BR> <BR>I think
    we need less emotion in our design, but rather a keen, maybe even intellectual,
    journalistic approach to what we do. Content first, seduction only as a means
    to promote positive content. '
