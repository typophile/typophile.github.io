  mostly on helping people identify typefaces on the Font ID forum and on broadening
  my own knowledge of the current type landscape.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that non-designers
  may wrongfully assume that logotypes are born, fully-formed, from a typeface, I
  seem to be encountering a growing number design students and young designers who
  assume the same.\r\n\r\nI did not go to art school, and I've only guest-lectured
  to design students a handful of times over the past twenty-five years. So my question
  to those of you who do interact with students more often\u2014either as full-time
  faculty or as frequent guest lecturers\u2014is this:\r\n\r\nDo you think that today's
  design students are being taught to actually create, or has the explosion and abundance
  of online resources resulted in a climate where they simply find a \"cool\" typeface
  and use it literally or virtually unaltered?\r\n\r\nYour thoughts would be appreciated....\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I gave a talk to some 3rd year graphic design students about type and logo
    design. They had virtually no knowledge about anything type-related, and I wondered
    to myself what exactly it was they were learning, as type is the cornerstone of
    graphic design. After the talk I set them an exercise to draw a word to see what
    sort of designs they could produce. The results were truly appalling: not one
    of them showed even the slightest competence in handling a pencil, looking like
    it was the first time they'd ever used one. A group of ten year olds could have
    done better. I showed them some of my stuff,\r\nhttp://www.g-type.com/portfolio\r\nAnd
    they were asking what fonts I'd used, or what the designs were based upon. They
    couldn't really grasp that I was capable of creating designs from scratch. I was
    shocked by the experience, and saddened to think that none of them have any chance
    of getting a job when they leave. "

    so I've always drawn and hand-lettered. Add to that the fact that desktop computers
    really didn't begin to take over design until I was halfway through college, and
    you've got someone who straddles the divide between analog and digital.\r\n\r\nIf
    you start with the computer and are never encouraged to use any other tools, I
    think it limits your creativity. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    You do actually need to be able to draw before you can draw with B\xE9ziers."

  body: "Agree with Nick's comment. \r\n\r\nBefore desktop publishing most design
    school taught how to draw fonts, which you needed at least for mockup purposes.
    Less emphasis on it these days.\r\n\r\nI think there's more emphasis on the graphic
    symbol. Clients sometimes view a purely typographic logo as a lazy solution \u2014\_\"I'm
    paying you $$$ for 10 minutes work to set the name in a font?\". Of course a typographic
    solution is perfect in many situations, but it can be a hard sell to less sophisticated
    clients."

  body: "Unfortunately there are companies that offer pre-made or incredibly cheap
    logos. Sometimes the designers are from countries where a few bucks goes further
    than it does here.\r\n\r\nIt skips the real work of designing a logo \u2014 meeting
    with the client, discussing goals and perceptions, analyzing their competition,
    going through rounds of revisions, preparing an identity manual, and so forth."

  body: "As I commented on another post a couple of weeks ago, used to I teach a book
    design class. I was teaching people to be graphic designers, not type designers,
    so I wasn't teaching typography per se, but I told my students that if you expect
    people to pay you to select type for them, you have to be able to do more than
    look at a list and say \"Papyrus looks cool, I think I'll use that,\" because
    your client/employer can do that for herself.\r\nTo help my students learn the
    factors that distinguish one face from another, and make one face more suitable
    than another for a specific purpose (weight, contrast, x-height, etc.), I had
    them draw a layout and render the display type by hand. \"No one will ever pay
    you to do this, ever,\" I told them, \"but I'm making you do this because I can
    show you slides and talk about bracketing all night, but it won't teach you half
    as much as if draw a word in Palatino and then draw the same word in Century.\""

    is early on in their course, and there is so much other stuff\u2014web, interactive,
    animation, etc.\u2014that it doesn\u2019t hold the position it once did.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the nature of typography has changed.\r\nIt used to be about choosing a typeface
    and how it is spaced, but that is not so important in dynamic-content media that
    doesn\u2019t \u201Cset\u201D type, and in applications that involve timelines."
