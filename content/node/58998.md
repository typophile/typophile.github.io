body: Hi all I have some old Postscript fonts on an OS 9.2 macintosh computer that
  I need to move onto a brand new OSX machine. The fonts are postscript fonts organized
  by adobe font suitcases. For some reason whenever I move them over to the new machine,
  OSX font book refuses to recognize them. Does anyone know why or have any suggestions
  for what to do?

    \"Frutiger\" is a screen font (or a \"suitcase\"), all others are printer fonts.
    And, they all look the same under OSX!"

    not bundled in one suitcase. AND the family links have to be resolved.\r\n\r\nIn
    the screenshot above there are 9 printerfonts and one suitcase with probably all
    the corresponding screenfonts. You would want to have nine separate screenfonts.\r\n\r\n.

    screen fonts? I have several machines, all on OS X since 10.1 (currently 10.5.6)
    and have absolutely no problems with bundled (suitcased) screen fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    don't use Font Book though; I use Suitcase."
