body: "Hello. I've been trying to identify a script font used in Capcom's \"Darkstalkers\"
  series of video games that was produced in the mid 1990's.\r\n\r\nHere are the font
  graphics that are actually used in the game itself:\r\nhttp://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n57/felineki/font1.png\r\nAnd
  here are some clippings from a promotional flyer that use the same font:\r\nhttp://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n57/felineki/font1b.png\r\n\r\nI've
  used several online resources, but have yet to find a match. Any help would be appreciated."

  body: I had considered that, but I know that the game uses other preexisting fonts
    ([[http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n57/felineki/0005.png|Ondine, for example,
    at the top of this screen]]), and the fact that the same font seems to have been
    used in a printed material makes me think that this is an actual font of some
    sorts.

  body: The font in the logo looks very similar to <a href="http://www.fontsaddict.com/font/stewart-sans.html">Stewart
    Sans</a> but its not exact.
