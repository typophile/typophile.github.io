  to outlines. Added a slight stroke. How do I now simplify the path, that is merge
  the stroke with the body? Any help appreciated. I've tried Illustrator's help pages,
  but am still stuck.\r\n\r\nThank you! \r\n\r\nihoff"

  body: Im not positive what you mean by "merge the stroke with the body" but I think
    the "outline stroke" command might be what you're looking for. Select your logo,
    then go to Object/Path/Outline Stroke.

  body: "Jonathan and Red \u2013 thanks very much for your suggestions! \r\n\r\nJonahtan:
    What I meant was turning a font to outline, then adding a stroke resulted in a
    letter that had too many points/paths. The stroke had a path and the main body
    had a path and I wanted to merge the two. The Pathfinder Add to Shape option wasn't
    working.\r\n\r\nRed: You're second suggestion solved my problem! Thank you!!!!
    I've spent hours trying to work this one out. I've learned something new today.
    :)"

  body: '"offset path" will also accomplish this. you can choose the amount of offset
    to mimic the stroke weight you like, apply offset, then use pathfinder to merge.
    no strokes needed.'

  body: ihoff, if I understand you correctly, you are adding a stroke to your outlined
    text. This will eat into the characters and change the shape of the letters. The
    solution is to outline your text, copy it, and then use the "paste in back" command
    (I believe it's in the Edit menu). <em>That</em> is the text you stroke. Does
    this explanation make sense?

    and the way you're doing i think you will lose... of course we are forgetting
    something... proportions! proportions from stroke to the outline and proportions

    is useful if the stroke and the fill are two different colors.

    \ Here's the solution that satisfied my needs, based on the techniques mentioned
    in this thread so far:\r\n\r\n1. Convert Text to Outlines (cmd + shift + o)\r\n2.
    Object > Path > Offset Path.  Set offset to the stroke you would like.\r\n3. Object
    > Compound Path > Release\r\n4. Ungroup.  (cmd + shift + g)\r\n5. Pathfinder >
    Add to Shape, then Expand.\r\n\r\nThe result is a shape that mimics a text stroke.\r\n\r\n"

    number of points you want) and it will create a separate shape behind the type
    that is slightly larger. That way, you aren''t crowding the inner elements of
    the type: it stays completely intact, you are just building around it.'

    using the Appearance Palette.\r\n\r\ndaniel"
