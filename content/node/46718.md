  1999 album cover</a>? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/splinter-crop_5285.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've
  tried Identifont and WhatTheFont, but no luck. It seems to be Helvetica bold, but
  the <em>s</em> and <em>l</em> aren't right. (Neither are the <em>p</em> descenders,
  but those might just be customized). \r\n\r\nThanks for your help. "

  body: I don't know, but it's really nice! I feel that Helvetica is a bit to rational
    and cold for me at the moment, but this one could most definately be used as an
    alternative. I especially like the 'l'

    it so bad. I even tried to find out who designed the cover, but no success there
    either. \r\n\r\nHopefully someone here knows. "

  body: "Looks like someone\u2019s been playing around with Helvetica Bold, strangely
    cutting the n and p, borrowing the lc. s from Akzidenz Grotesk Bold and adding
    a Schulbuch Nord-inspired lc. l.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a similar (but
    consistently designed) font I\u2019d recommend Schulbuch Nord, which is a reworked
    Akzidenz Grotesk that has been designed for German schoolbooks. There\u2019s also
    Schulbuch S\xFCd (aka Schoolbook Alternate etc.), which has a slightly more Futura-like
    feel.\r\nPlease note that both Schulbuch Nord and S\xFCd have the single storey
    a."

    example the last 's' in 'Pimps' looks like Akzidenz Grotesk.\r\n\r\nBut it could
    be something entirely else, of course.\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\n\r\n\r\nLooks like G\xFCnniGutenberg
    beat me to it."

    mix between Helvetica and whatever typeface is found on the inside copy of the
    booklet. I will try and scan it for you soonish."

  body: "Hi Fruity,\r\n\r\nat the time when Schulbuch Nord/S\xFCd have been designed,
    the standard font used in Germany was Akzidenz Grotesk.\r\nThe reason for producing
    a special version of AG exclusively for school books was a simple one: Some letter
    shapes (like the lc. a) were adapted to the ones of the \u201CAusgangsschriften\u201D,
    standardised hand writings taught at primary school in Germany. The intention
    was to interlink (and therefore facilitate) the process of learning both to read
    and to write.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nG\xFCnni"
