  font for the Be-Ro logo is a custom font or if it is a typeface.\r\n\r\nIf you can
  identify any of the other fonts used, that'd be great too, although don't worry
  as it's mainly for personal curiosity.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated,\r\n\r\nSam.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_0056_6309.jpg]"

  body: "Just a guess, but the rest of the type might be hand lettered. \"Be-Ro\"
    wouldn't be difficult. \"Self-Raising\" might have been drawn based on Triplett
    Light, as they're very similar. \r\n\r\nThe other 2 lines (\"Flour\" and \"For...\")
    are clearly hand lettered."
