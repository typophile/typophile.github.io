  sharp comic font, used in the comic book named Cairo (a graphic novel by G.Willow
  Wilson, 2009)? It resembles both sans-serif and horror fonts but I've never seen
  a similar one in comic fonts weblists. If it cannot be identified, then maybe someone
  knows any similar comic or non-comic font with such the sharp features? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Speech
