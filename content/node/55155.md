  anyone know whether the Twitter logo is a font? I tried something called Pico which
  is close, but not correct. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanx,\r\n\r\nRoss"

  body: Great article - thanx Simon! No Twitter font listed there though. Someone
    has suggested, and I tend to agree, it's a custom job.

  body: "It's probably custom indeed, and in my opinion it's rather poorly done too.\r\nI
    mean, what's up with that first 't'? Is it somekind of capital? It's all big and
    fat. The other two 't's are also much too heavy. The 'e' is just a blob."
