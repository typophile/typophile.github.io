  this font I saw in a presentation Stefan Sagmeister gave. These are just screen
  captures \u2013 the bottom two are definitely distorted (perspective) and the top
  one looks like it may be as well (slightly squished vertically). Did a little searching
  online for anyone talking about this font, but didn't see anything."

    is close though not matching. Could be [[http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Gravur+Condensed/|Gravur
    Condensed]], slightly distorted as you said.

  body: All good suggestions. I've been looking at the punctuation (comma and question
    mark), and that eliminates any of these as an exact match. It's hard to find an
    exact match not knowing how distorted the original specimens are, too. I'll try
    to find better source images. Thanks.

    difference between comma and question mark from your sample and Gravur Condensed's.

      Your insistence made me look harder. I was comparing the sample (1) to the Gravur
      Condensed Bold (5) you pointed out. In it's original form, the Gravur Bold is
      obviously too condensed, but the question mark has a kink and the comma a longer
      \"tail\" than the sample. So, I was curious how the Gravur Bold would look is
      squished like the sample presumably is (4). Seemed like the weight was a little
      light, so I tried the Black (3), then squished (2). That looks like it might
      be it. Now it's maybe just a question of whether Stefan squishes it at all,
      or if it's just something that happened at some other point in the slide presentation
      or video production."
