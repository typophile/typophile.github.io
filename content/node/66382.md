body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI have been set the task of coming up with a nice large website
  header, as you can see Im going down the typography path. The first obstacle I have
  encountered is that I am limited in terms of typeface choice due to it needing to
  be web safe. I am a big fan of typography that mixes sans and sans serif and also
  the quirkiness of playing with the reader in terms of where the eye goes.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I would like to ask you pros is despite my limitation regarding choice of typefaces
  does arial and century work well together? Are there any issues that jump out? Overall
  whats your opinion?\r\n\r\nThis site is a godsend, thanks alot.\r\n\r\nPhil."

  body: "I am not a pro, but mixing the two fonts works here, particularly because
    of the different tones used. \"we are\" emerges clearly as a phrase, but is the
    penciled arrow part of the design? If so it is unnecessary. I wonder if \"are\"
    can somehow be placed to the extreme right. something like this might read more
    naturally. \r\n\r\nwelcome - redup\r\ndigital media are\r\n==============\r\n==============\r\n\r\nAlso
    have you considered simply using type converted to a gif or jpeg instead of html
    text? Then you can use any font you like. With such large text sizes having the
    image stretch to fill any monitor resolution might work in terms of edge sharpness.
    Another idea is to forgoe the block concept, floating the top text left and the
    bottom line right. Have fun. \r\n\r\n"

    digital media are web designers...\"\r\n\r\n...which makes no sense.\r\n\r\nSometimes
    the best approach is the simplest approach. Trying to be clever for the sake of
    itself sometimes detracts from the content. "
