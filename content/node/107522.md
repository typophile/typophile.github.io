  a few other places but no luck.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/asrc_6241.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    of a logo/artwork. \r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/asrc_logo_3579.jpg]\r\n\r\nSorry
    to say they are the only letter available  ...I guess tracing the letters is the
    only option now left open.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
