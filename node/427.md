body: 'Hello. Total newbie here. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been making my own fonts for quite
  some time now using Font Creator Program &#40;I hear groaning&#41;. One visitor
  to my site, a Mac user, downloaded my Tin Doghouse and Tin Birdhouse fonts, but
  found that the Mac versions lagged behind the current versions. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  lost my contact for converting to Mac, so I&#39;m stuck doing it myself. Fortunately,
  I do have complete access to a Mac, and the person I&#39;m trying to help has a
  conversion program, TTConverter. The trouble is that things have gotten weird. <BR>
  <BR>Photoshop doesn&#39;t seem to recognize the Italic version of the font at all.
  Outlook Express does recognize the font, but won&#39;t do &#34;special characters&#34;.
  &#40;He&#39;s from France, so he may mean accented characters.&#41; InDesign works
  in a way: <BR> <BR>&#34;If i select a text yet typed and change the font to one
  of the tins, it works. But i can type anything, even spaces display always the same
  odd character. The special charcters function of InDesign works perfectly, but it&#39;s
  not very quick.&#34; <BR> <BR>Anybody have any idea what&#39;s going on here? <BR>
  <BR>The originals can be downloaded at: <BR> <BR><a href="http://dartcanada.tripod.com/Objets/New/tz_frame.html"

  can post what I got when I tried converting to Mac if that would help.'

  body: You have a font called Yerevan? Cool. I can see some Armenian-ness in it,
    but as you probably realize it needs work...  :-/ <BR> <BR>Keep it up! <BR> <BR>hhp

    TransType</a>. Works more reliably than the good old TTConverter. '

  body: Ouch. It&#39;s $100 US. I don&#39;t have that kind of money. <BR> <BR>Have
    you noticed this kind of weird behaviour coming from TTConverter before? I&#39;m
    wondering if it&#39;s some setting or something that needs to be done to the fonts
    themselves.

  body: Actually, it&#39;s not. It has a $45 US registration fee, and registration
    includes being able to make an italic version, which has been my specific problem.
    <BR> <BR>My big problem is that I don&#39;t know Macs, and my friend in France
    doesn&#39;t know the inner workings of fonts. <BR> <BR>I have Suitcase on the
    Mac, I haven&#39;t been able to make a suitcase that has more than one font in
    it, which I&#39;ve seen. I know there are things I&#39;m doing wrong. Does anyone
    have any advice, or a place to point me to for better instruction, before I start
    throwing money at the problem?

  body: I know exactly what you mean about the font creator program. But it&#39;s
    cheap and while I&#39;m a newbie I figure it&#39;s a good learning tool. And it&#39;s
    pretty amazing for shareware!  <BR> <BR>Sorry, no help on the conversion issues.
    I own a Mac at home but haven&#39;t had a chance to try to make a font for it.
    Hang in there<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: Sorry about the Crossfont information. I&#39;ve downloaded it a long time
    ago, and never actually used it, so... :-/ <BR>I don&#39;t know much about Macs
    and font conversions, but as a workaround, you can just rename the italic and
    not generate it as a proper italic. The user of your font will have to change
    the typeface each time he uses the italic.

  body: Reviving the old, old thread. Now I have someone else, a Japanese magazine,
    who want to feature some of my fonts in an article of some sort. They&#39;ve listed
    the fonts they&#39;re interested in, but may not realize that they&#39;re actually
    a version behind. <BR> <BR>I have access to a Mac, and PCs galore, including a
    friend&#39;s that has FontLab on it. Can I use <i>that</i> to make Mac fonts?
    Our first efforts seem to have made PC Type1 fonts that my Mac doesn&#39;t recognize.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;Still clueless when it comes to Macs. I have a G4, and I can&#39;t
    manage to access anything on CD-ROM by myself. :/ &#41;
