body: "New to Typophile. I'll have to do some browsing & see myself around to find
  what's good on this site. \r\n\r\nTHU OCT 1st, [[http://www.ReadyType.com|ReadyType.com]]
  was launched. I put up one font family, \"Action\u2122\". It consists of two fonts,
  Action-Regular & Action-Oblique. I've been sitting on it since 2001. \r\n\r\nI recently
  decided to reprogram Action\u2122 and use it as my first font release. I can't remember
  why exactly. I had a few to chose from which were all different. I will release
  more fonts over the coming weeks. Tangent\u2122 will be the next release. I posted
  the letter \"e\" on the site to see what kind of response people will have.\r\n\r\nAside
  from Typography, I'm a design director, & knee deep into a project at the moment.
  It's very exciting yet time consuming. I don't see myself taking a day off anytime
  in the near futue."
