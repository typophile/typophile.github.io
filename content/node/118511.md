body: "Hello! Someone in here can help me with Glyphs?? I'm adding the small caps
  to my font, but actually it's the first time i do this so (this is also my first
  font), I'm having some troubles: InDesign doesn't make the change of letters when
  I use the Small Caps button, just from the OpenType window and it works only on
  the capital letters; and, I dont know neither how to set the case sensitive signs
  in open type  what suffix do I need to put on my glyphs and which Open Type function
  works for that?\r\nI hope someone can help me with this problem  greetings from
  Mexico!"

  body: And, InDesign not applying true small caps using the Small caps button sadly
    is the way it's designed, so nothing your or any other font can change.

  body: InDesign does apply true small caps when you push the small caps button if
    the font has them. If not, it makes fake ones. You can specify what size the fake
    small caps are generated at in preferences. If you set the preference to 100%
    (full size), the button will never fake the small caps if they aren't in the font.

  body: "InDesign has done this since version 1.0 back in the year 2000.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the small caps button only invokes 'smcp' to turn lowercase into small caps. Caps
    to small caps ('c2sc') requires the sub-menu selection. The \"all small caps\"
    option does both."

    almost exclusively, I probably forgot/misremembered what was \u201Cwrong\u201D
    with the button ;-)"

  body: I'm with you on that one. Would much rather the button was for "all small
    caps."
