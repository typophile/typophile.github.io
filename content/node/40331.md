  finally made it into In Your Face, the monthly newsletter from Myfonts.com</a>\r\n\r\nYay!
  Like it's a big deal (I'm exaggerating). But seriously, it isn't every day you produce
  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/amity/\" target=\"_new\">a marvellous
  solution to the problem Herbert Bayer failed at with a mixed case uniheight design
  that makes a cute and useful headliner display type, like Amity for example</a>.
  The Myfonts text gives a neat summation: \r\n\r\n<em>\"James Arboghast's Sentinel
  Type recently released a Bayer-inspired unicase \u2013 Amity is both modern (or
  perhaps Moderne) and Deco, with a truckload of alternates that owe just as much
  to Celtic alphabets as they do Herbert Bayer and Kurt Schwitters' unicase and phonetic
  alphabets. It's a bold, confident face that would be an ideal building block for
  logo designers and poster artists alike.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThanks Myfonts. Thanks Joshua
  Lurie-Terrell for the wonderful word smithing.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amity_6097.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  good news about Amity is the imminent release of an inline version to expand the
  type's stylistic range. I plan to add Amity Inline to the main font package with
  no increase in price, making Amity much better value for money. People who have
  already purchased the original package will receive the upgrade free of charge.\r\n\r\nj

    and he's a pure delight of a fella to boot, but I gots to give ups to my big boss.

    has revitalized it and extended its life. Count yourself as very fortunate you
    work for him.\r\n\r\nCheers Jos :^) Gradually, with effort, I have arrived at
    last, altho my feet hardly touch the ground.\r\n\r\nOh god no, I've spelt Laurence

    and I look forward to seeing the family grow - and seeing the sales numbers as
    well, which I have a feeling will be excellent.\r\n\r\nI am merely a substitute
    while Laurence burns the midnight oil on other projects, and I cannot imagine
    that I do nearly as good a job as he, but I do try.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt : http://www.hewnandhammered.com"
