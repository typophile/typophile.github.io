  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So I started playing around with some letterforms I drew. Initially, my idea was to make a unicase typeface; but since everyone would just point out that there&rsquo;s little need for unicase fonts, I decided to draw both alphabets (that&rsquo;s not the only reason, of course&hellip;). However, I did start out with this.</p>
<p>I have lots of problems with many of the characters, most of them I can&rsquo;t quite see how I can solve, so what I&rsquo;m looking for is anything AT ALL that you&rsquo;d like to share with me about this (if you like it, if it&rsquo;s any good, if the world needs it – you know what I mean –, if the stroke thickness is all wrong – where and why would be nice&hellip; how to solve it would be excellent –, if some character seems out of place, if it reminds you of something, etc.). I mean really anything.</p>
<p>Some things I&rsquo;d like to add&hellip; I drew everything directly on the computer. I know, I know&hellip; I shouldn&rsquo;t have and that&rsquo;s probably where most of my mistakes come from, but I&rsquo;m going all the way with this and you can&rsquo;t stop me! :P
Don&rsquo;t mind the O, I drew that just because I thought the O was too bare in comparison with the other characters. It would be an alternate, as would the R, probably. And I will do the other alphabet, but am planning to maintain the uppercase at the same height as the lowercase, because I really just wanted a way of combining lowercase and uppercase letterforms to make separate words look good&hellip; you know&hellip; I&rsquo;d use this typeface to easily create simple logos (or the starting point for logos), for example, or to use as a display face on posters. I kind of always imagine using it on a poster for a music festival, with all the separate names of the bands and stuff, although I can&rsquo;t quite imagine which kind of music festival would look good in this&hellip; :P It&rsquo;s just an example.</p>
<p>That said, here&rsquo;s the image. There&rsquo;s a lot more to say (mainly because I&rsquo;m all over the place with it), but I guess we&rsquo;ll keep in touch. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I love unicase fonts.  This is cool.  You might look at the gothic alphabet and uncial faces for some inspiration.</p>
<p>I like the K, Z, T, and H best.</p>
<p>Keep the flair inside the O, just make it a bit smaller, and make it not touch the right side of the bowl.</p>
<p>The X is falling over to the right.</p>
<p>The tail on the Q and R are too different. Pick angular or curved, and run with it.  Same with the Y.</p>
<p>The F looks like something mashed it down on the top left.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Keep going with this.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>I know I have to alter most of the characters, so it really helps that you singled some out, glyphobet. That way I can tell what&rsquo;s more important and noticeable and what&rsquo;s not.
I had kind of thought about the tails on Q and R, but I thought they should be different, since I was aiming to create a uniqueness on all (or most) of the characters&hellip; and also, I really like the angular tail on the Q, but think it wouldn&rsquo;t work on the R. Also, this R will probably be an alternate, so that wouldn&rsquo;t be that big of a deal&hellip; but I will think about that (and the Y). Thank you for pointing that out!
You&rsquo;re right about the X and the F – though I was fond of that top left of the F – and I will think about that idea about the O, too.
I&rsquo;m really glad you liked those characters&hellip; the T, for instance, was really great, in my head, but when I drew it it kind of looked strange and out of balance&hellip; I also thought maybe the H should be a tad wider and I should do something about the top leg on the K (though I still don&rsquo;t know what, exactly); what do you think?</p>
<p>Now about mr: I&rsquo;m glad you like it!
I did run into a lot of trouble with the N and the M&hellip; I was thinking the contrast is there on all the characters, but it is a bit discreet, so when I thought about the contrast on these letters I didn&rsquo;t want to overdo it, because it would be too noticeable&hellip; you really think I should give them more contrast? Should I focus on making the thin strokes thinner, the thick thicker or both?
About the D, I&rsquo;m thinking I should probably make it a bit wider, because it&rsquo;s hard to add contrast when the thin part of the stroke isn&rsquo;t long enough. Originally it was wider, but the counter looked too open when compared with the others&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks again and please, keep&rsquo;em comin'. :)
