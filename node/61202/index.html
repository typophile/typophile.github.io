<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if you might have a knockoff version that has a weird &ldquo;i&rdquo;? If so, the original is only $39.</p>

<p>You are correct, on both accounts somewhat. I used Emigre&rsquo;s Lunatix Bold (black text) and Emigre&rsquo;s Platelet Heavy (font that is giving fits) and I like the font a lot except for the lower case &ldquo;i&rdquo;. I did some kerning and tweaking and ran into this problem. I also don&rsquo;t like the default lower case &ldquo;b&rdquo;, but there is an alt character. None for the &ldquo;i&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think I might run a request into Emigre and ask them to have the designer reconsider this character or at least put an alt character in the set.</p>
<p>I had some non-designer eyes look at this over the past two nights and I got a few &ldquo;hard to read&rdquo; comments. So I need to play around with this layout more.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ahhh, okay, the lowercase stuff is in Platelet. I assumed it was al Lunatix.</p>
<p>Aside from readability, it might not be a bad idea to move away from using just Emigre stuff, as it can look a little dated. At least to me &ndash; those fonts where everywhere when they came out, and kind of scream I AM FROM THE EARLY 1990s!</p>
<p>The postcard looks great, though. The orange and green look really nice.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think that the whole artwork is a bit cliché-like concerning to what customers are expecting from &lsquo;creative people&rsquo;. It is screaming, there are details over details, you put icons after every statement on the backside you change from uppercase to lowercase on the frontside, you&rsquo;ve used orange to attract attention, you choose a very constructed font, you feature various illustrations, you inserted a photograph, you are using rows of stars, the pencils are burning, (&hellip;).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very in-your-face and I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the best way to go if you&rsquo;re doing self-promotion. Maybe try a more subtle way and try to focus on one or two (maybe three) prominent &lsquo;graphics&rsquo; instead of pushing everything to the limit with intent to show what you can.</p>
<p>Problems concerning legibilty have already been mentioned before.</p>
<p>Maybe it was your intention to create a persiflage of overdesigned artworks but then you&rsquo;d need to spend more time on the details.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Simplicious -</p>
<p>Since I am not yet able to purchase a letter press I was going for a modern, digitized version of a letter press layout. Was kinda going for a modern spin on Hatch Show Print or Yee-Haw Industries look or an a modern version of an old 60&rsquo;s Boxing poster. I could screen print - and try for a faux letter press look - but was kinda limited by finances. Trying to do for less than $500. This might be first of a number of post cards. So yes - the look is supposed to be in your face or loud. I&rsquo;m not looking for a clean simple look - nothing against it - just not in my wheel house. I also wanted to show my illustration abilities.</p>
<p>Thanks for the input - I am looking at this from a fresh perspective and will definitely utilize your comments!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i think the look you&rsquo;re going for makes it hard to critique.</p>
<p>the illustration is great tho, i loved finding those pencils. didn&rsquo;t catch them at first.</p>
<p>but yes&ndash;details.
the stars on the bottom and top run off the page in different places, and i find that looks unintentional. 
the two cut out hemispheres behind the S in skilled are driving me crazy. omit them.</p>
<p>also, if all the type is justified down the left hand side of the cover&ndash;then why has the website shifted to the right, and become longer? i understand NOT justifying to call attention to it&ndash;but it&rsquo;ll have to move over a lot more to look like there was a reason for it</p>

		<div class="commentbody">That&rsquo;s exactly what I mean. You want to show your abilities (which is a fine thing) but I think that prioritizing is key because than you could pick let&rsquo;s say 3 really good illustrations and making them stand out as what the are -&gt; Fine artwork. For example I&rsquo;m really digging the icons on the backside and I think they would even look better next to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; typography. In this combination they are fighting for recognition against type. It&rsquo;s too &lsquo;blurry&rsquo; to me -&gt; maybe overdesigned. But of course it&rsquo;s also important to have a certain style which will be recognized by customers.</div>
