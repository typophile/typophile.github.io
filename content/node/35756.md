  within Indesign, instead of just standard vertical columns, however, its not possible
  from my knowledge of working with the program... Is there a plugin of some sort?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance...\r\nRez"

    trying to do:\r\n-- Add Guides - draws guides around the selected object or objects\r\n--
    Make Grid - divides the selected frame (or frames) into grid(s) of frames\r\n\r\nYou
    can get the scripts on this page:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/scripting/
    (click on the \"Scripting Resources\" tab)\r\n"

    sound m8, thanks. Although, I wondered if there was a way of creating them from
    the main menu options, so to speak. Like your column choices... etc.\r\n\r\nThe
    way you have mentioned will do fine for me though. Many thanks to you both for
    your answers...\r\n\r\nx"
