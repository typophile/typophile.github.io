body: I can't seem to find a match for this serif. H&J Didot 06 is a close match and
  so is Bodoni but nothing matches exactly. Thoughts?

  body: Karloff Positive italic sure looks close to me. Where does it go wrong?  Dick[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stockup1_4559.jpg]

  body: "To my eye, the hairline serifs are thinner on Karloff than on the sample,
    and the curl on the upper arm of the|k| is a bit more aggressive on Karloff (and
    the leg on Karloff\u2019s |k| joins to the body with more of a point than on the
    sample). Also, Karloff\u2019s |t| has a shorter crossbar. And the curls at the
    foot of Karloff\u2019s letters are tighter.\r\n\r\nBut then again, I wear bifocals/progressive
    lenses and my eyes aren't what they used to be....."
