  I'm pretty sure the sign was hand-lettered, as most were 100 years ago, but I recognize
  the font it is based on. I just can't quite pull up the name from the dark corners
  of my brain, and don't see it when scrolling through my collection and searching
  likely suspects. Please help?\r\n\r\nIt's funny, I never really liked this font,
  but now I need it. :-p"

    foxtail leg on the R:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KeberCo_3426.jpg]\r\nThis
    would seem to work as a way of creating the appropriate font.\r\nFor inspiration
    on foxtails for other letters, I like Dave Rowland's Vulpa Bold: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/vulpa/\r\nDon"

    quite sure I recognize the R and C, I just can't recall from where. But this is
    a good solution. I have to wrap this project by tomorrow. Thank you!"
