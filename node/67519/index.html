  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m trying to decide, in order to make a recommendation, between 2 typefaces my client has picked as favorites. The client is a pretty hip industrial design firm that designs and builds department store displays. The project is an updated website, I&rsquo;m the developer (with a little design in my background). I&rsquo;m assisting in the visual design of the site and we&rsquo;re doing a bit of design back and forth. So, there&rsquo;s 2 faces that my client really likes, one option is PTL Vielzweck, the other is FF Max.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m torn between what I like personally and what might suit them. I feel FF Max has a dated feel already and wouldn&rsquo;t work that great in small sizes on screen. I really like DIN, so I&rsquo;m digging Vielzweck, which I think would really stand the test of time and taste, but maybe it&rsquo;s too plain and lacks &lsquo;style&rsquo;. I guess I should mention when my client did the initial layout he used screen grabs of FF Max, so he might be leaning that way.</p>
<p>What do you think, should I let my own taste determine? 
Is this the type of thing it&rsquo;s fair to ask of a Design forum here at Typophile?</p>
<p>Thanks. Kind regards,
Dave</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well you hardly mentioned anything about the nature of your client so you&rsquo;re really just deferring to our personal taste, which is even less relevant than your own. Use the font that says what it needs to say.</p>
<p>That said, I think Vielzweck in a medium weight has a structural feel that would suit an industrial design firm and is also hip looking.</p>
<p>Or just use DIN. No designer will ever reject DIN Schriften.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks to both of you. Bill, you&rsquo;re right about not mentioning about the nature of my client. &lsquo;pretty hip&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t a very good descriptor.  He does like to change their logo alot, which I kinda like&hellip; maybe a better question would have been along the lines of something more technical, not sure.</p>
<p>Anyway, I really like the Vielzweck, didn&rsquo;t know the translation was mutlipurpose, pretty neat! I started some design with DIN and then when I came back here and read your posts I thought, heck I&rsquo;m buying Vielzweck. If they don&rsquo;t wanna use it I&rsquo;ll use it for something else. In addition to the good feeling I get buying type I&rsquo;m digging the Open Type these days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing some work with Vielzweck and thinking about a nice compliment for text. I saw someone posting about Hunter and Caecilia or another slab serif with Gotham. I have a feeling the same might hold true for Vielzweck. Any suggestions or technical tips for choosing a second typeface? I&rsquo;ve read contrast is key. Maybe seriffed, with a light feel and italic?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
