  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>I’m working on a logo for an organisation called Food &amp; Fitness that teach children aged 7-11 about healthy eating and exercise. The organisation is part of a company which promotes dairy products - this is why they have tried to replicate a milk bottle to be part of the scales in their current logo (if you can call it that).</p>
<p>The client would like a &lsquo;modernised&rsquo; version of their logo - but I haven&rsquo;t quite nailed this as yet - Fitness is a longer word than Food so the words naturally look unbalanced and the scales have to be &lsquo;balanced&rsquo; so that each word is of equal merit. So still pondering this one&hellip;</p>
<p>The client is also interested to see totally new designs and possibly a new strapline - so I have attached my thoughts so far&hellip; Design 3 could be an &lsquo;encased&rsquo; logo instead of a drop shadow i.e. so the dark blue follows the shape of the letters but forms one solid backdrop - if anyone can advise how I would do this that would be cool as I&rsquo;ve never tried that type of logo form before. I would really like to create a 3D, stamp-like option that was appealing to kids.</p>
<p>Any feedback you can give is gratefully received, thanks in advance :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is what I&rsquo;ve created since my last post and is the logo I have chosen to work up. I&rsquo;m currently working on simplifying the character and will be adding another kid on the other side of the words. The strapline will also be changing to something different - any opinions on the typefaces chosen here?</p>
<p>I have chosen colours that compliment each other and imply &lsquo;healthy&rsquo; while also considering that the overall company to which Food &amp; Fitness belong, promotes dairy products - hence the use of blue tones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d appreciate any feedback you can give :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like your new concept better than your previous ones, and I like the font and use of lowercase letters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like having the tag line (&ldquo;for happy, healthy kids&rdquo;) inside the logo, It&rsquo;s way too small and it clutters up the logo. I&rsquo;d suggest making it larger (perhaps the same width as &ldquo;fitness&rdquo;) and putting it below the logo. Then tighten up the leading slightly where it used to be. When the logo is reproduced small (on a business card, for example), you may need to eliminate the tag line completely.</p>
<p>Regarding colors, I can see the connection of green to food, but I don&rsquo;t see the connection of blue to either food, dairy or fitness. And blue and green are both cool, passive colors. Have you considered using a warmer 2nd color, like maybe something in the orange-red range, to reflect the active element of fitness?  The light blue/dark blue combination looks rather sleepy.</p>
