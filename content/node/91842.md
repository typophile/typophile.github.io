  or possibly VAG round, maybe confortaa - but no - I've been searching this for over
  an hour and find very close fonts but not quite. I am beginning to think maybe the
  original designer drew this.\r\n\r\nCan you identify it? It's only shown in lower
  case, and notice how the \"m\" and \"u\" do not have an upright. Always a single
  path. If anyone can help me identify this I would really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGTC"

  body: whoops *comfortaa. I realized there is no "u" but it is just like the "n"
    but inverted. Also, the "t" has a curve at the bottom, as many fonts I looked
    at were straight.
