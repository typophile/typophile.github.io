  obliques.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typetrust.com/font/heroiccondensed]]\r\n\r\n...and
  the PDF...\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/specimen_pdfs/TypeTrust_HeroicCondensed.pdf]]\r\n\r\nRegular
  price is $240 for the 16 fonts set.  It's on sale for $160 until June 11, 2008.
  \ Individual weights are half off.\r\n\r\nAbout the typeface...\r\n\r\n- - - -\r\n\r\nHeroic
  Condensed is the graphic embodiment of the idealized, no-nonsense, narrow grotesque.
  From poster design to editorial layout, Heroic Condensed is intended for a range
  of uses\u2014a worthy addition to any designer\u2019s font collection.\r\n\r\nNot
  just a quickly generated spin-off of a text family, Heroic Condensed has been crafted
  from scratch with a structural logic of its own: a fusion of pure geometry and optical
  balance. At its core you will find a geometric skeleton, but mathematics alone does
  not make attractive type. Heroic Condensed has been honed by and for the acute and
  sublime workings of the human eye. The finest adjustments have been applied to every
  curve and every angle of its letterforms for even color and visual equality across
  a versatile range of eight weights. Even regarding usability, Heroic Condensed exhibits
  technical refinement. With careful attention paid to the economy of metrics, the
  need for extensive kerning tables has been alleviated by a hand-tuned matrix of
  sidebearings in conjunction with already streamlined glyph designs.\r\n\r\nHeroic
  Condensed is further bolstered with Opentype Small Caps, Tabular Figures, Fractions,
  and the standard TypeTrust character set which includes a full array of Latin diacritics."

    on at the moment, actually. Great work! :)
