body: When I think of a city I think of the hustle and bustle of the people everyday
  trying to get to work on time. Then I think of New Orleans and what comes to mind
  is the excitement of the creativity that just seems to flow through every person
  in this city. This is obvious by the artwork and architecture of the city. One of
  my favorite places to look at is Sucre, the dessert shop on Magazine street. Just
  looking at this place from the outside is amazing. It is one of the most unique
  designs and brands, I believe, to be in this city.I for one thought that it had
  to be a chain from some foreign city and I was very much mistaken. It actually was
  conceptualized by someone who has been in the city of New Orleans for a while and
  I could not believe it. The creativity and uniqueness makes it seem very foreign,
  unlike the rest of the shops. What makes it even more amazing is the design of the
  boxes as well as their dessert displays. It is so unique because of the color scheme
  which is a baby blue color mostly with other soft colors. The overall design of
  this brand is amazing and that tends to be the case with all things in New Orleans.
  I mean, I know a lot of people tend to think of drinking and partying but when you
  are able to view the beauty of the architecture as well as just feel and see the
  artistic vibe in this city, then you will experience more than just a party.

    look anything like New Orleans, though it does look like a lot of store fronts
    in New York City's Soho district, Madison Avenue and store fronts in San Francisco
    and L.A."

    Just out of curiosity...are you from here? If not, you're spoken like a true native.
    There are a few shops that seem a little out of place that are on magazine, they're
    generally the trendy, guido and barbie outfitters. I do like the fact that many
    of the shops support local art by allowing consignments!

    chef designed the store but I could be wrong. I will find out for sure for you
    Nancy. Also, to Louie, I am not from here but sometimes I feel like I am and I
    do love how a lot of the stores support local art also. This city wouldn''t thrive
    creatively if the people in the city did not embrace it. '

  body: "Christilisa,\r\nWhen I think of a city, I too, think of the \" hustle and
    bustle of the people everyday trying to get to work on time.\" However, I do not
    think of New Orleans as that kind of city. It is very unique and very different
    then other large cities in the U.S. \r\nI would compare New Orleans to a southern
    city in Italy where everyone is laid back and it takes one hour just to deposit
    money in the bank because everyone is hot and working in slow motion. Besides
    Whole foods do you know most shops on magazine do not open until 10 or 11am? I
    am an early morning person who tries to get a lot done before work and I get so
    frustrated that these stores are not open when it is most convenient for me. Instead
    of hustling to get to work, I see these people strolling with a coffee in their
    hand to open the stores five minutes late! I disagree with SUCRE being one of
    the most unique designs in the city. It does stand out because it is different
    from many of the local store designs but I agree with Nancy that is looks like
    a lot of store fronts in NY and San Francisco. I am glad such designs are being
    brought to New Orleans to give that contemporary feeling from other large cities
    but I do hope the hand lettering, rusty, paint peeling charm never goes away.

  body: 'Daniela you are right about New Orleans people moving at a laid back pace
    but it seems that downtown that is not the case at least to me. Everyone seems
    to be in such a rush but shops on magazine are very laid back and in no hurry
    at all to open well except for the coffee shops because it seems people in New
    Orleans can''t have enough coffee. Also, Nancy I found out that the branding was
    done by the Peter Mayer Group and that the store design was done by two local
    architects. '
