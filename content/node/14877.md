    that would differentiate such a competition from the others?\r\n\r\nA long time
    ago, there was the _Typophile 50_ show. That was way cool."

  body: "Miles, you're right: we would need to consider awards and judges at the beginning.
    For both of those, it might be best to look outside of Typophile\u2026 maybe there
    could be \"sponsors\" that could come up with prizes. I don't think that Typophile
    has a budget that would allow for it to pay for prizes on its own.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    judging is a big issue in its own right. Judges \"make\" a competition, don't
    they? Either we could try to get \"objective\" judges from outside of typophile
    to do the judging (but who?), or we could arrange some sort of voting thing. I
    don't like the idea of elevating a few people from within the Typophile community
    to 'judge' status. But I also wonder if enough different kinds of people would
    vote if we had a voting system."

  body: "I think a Typophile type competition is a bad idea. \r\n\r\nOne of the distinctive
    features of Typophile is its democatic voice. The most experienced and accomplished
    and the novice can post alike, and are treated with pretty much the same kindness
    and cruelty. \r\n\r\nThis egalitarean voice has its drawbacks, but pretty much
    nowhere else is so open and equal. The market place of course is very competitive
    and always sorting out winners and losers, as well as competitions, so there is
    plenty of this in the world.  \r\n\r\nIt is good that Typophile is a place of
    some respite from this. I don't have a problem with Typophile being used by another
    sponsor to get democratic judging, but Typophile as a sponsor for judging critiqued
    faces it seems to me would put more pressure on those who submit for critiques.

  body: "I think that a type contest could be a good motivation for typophile to get
    more advertising.\r\nA contest it\xB4s more that a win/loose fight arena, it\xB4s
    a high motivation event to get a huge expectation from the graphic market and
    media, to know new font developers from all over the world. Good prizes could
    from software(adobe, fontlab), a book with the contest\xB4s submissions per year,
    contracts with big foundries, typophile membership extras, money, etc."

    a Cinematic Poster\"."

    to match xyz"? The community would decide who wins. They would be more like hip
    hop battles than stuffy contests with ceremonies and medals.
