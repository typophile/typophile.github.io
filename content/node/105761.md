body: "Hello everyone, I'm looking for the font of a Red vs Blue title season, \"Out
  of Mind\", to make a personal composition in Photoshop. I thought it would be easy,
  because the letter \"F\" is highly characteristic, but I can't even manage to find
  something similar.\r\n\r\nIf anybody knows this font, could he tell me what it is?
  Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nS\xE9bastien C.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rvb_OoM_x360_banner_6272.png]"
