I suppose working with the narrow parameters you have chosen for yourself is for others more brave than myself. <BR> <BR>Also if I were to, and I do, design books, the last thing I would ever do is ask anyone for help choosing a typeface. Taste is what will decide the success of <i>book building.</i> So if it fails, it is because of you. No book has ever won any award simply because it was set in  the <i>latest model type face.</i> Type design, thankfully, does not follow <i>any planned obsolescence marketing model.</i> Recycling is good practice. We do not want perfectly good fonts leaching toxins in a land fill site. Do we? <BR> <BR>Type design is steeped in tradition. Built to last for hundreds of years. Some, hard to imagine, but in this very forum, bitterly complain, that types designs hundreds of years old outperform the digital carnival that is coming to town. Type is an investment, not a <i>Bic Pen throw away consumable.</i> <BR> <BR>Type is a language, dialects tend to stick around.  <BR> <BR>That said, maybe you should listen to Hrant.

		<div class="commentbody">Can I add my 2d worth as a constant user, not a designer, of books. <BR> <BR>I find the typeface to be about the least important thing in whether a book is nice to read. How the type is set, and how it is printed, and on what paper, and how the book is bound &ndash; these are far more important. Crispness and modernity are as likely to come from the design of the book, as from the design of the type. I have often seen two books set in the same type, and one is lovely to read, the other ghastly. This is down to the detailed typography, not the typeface. <BR> <BR>I suspect that using a new typeface for a book is a leap in the dark. Very long text settings really stretch text types. Little tiny idiosyncracies which would be perfectly tolerable in, say, a magazine article, become infuriating. <BR> <BR>I don't know how many books you have designed. But if the answer is &quot;not many&quot;, it might be better to choose a typeface that is in common use so that you can look at lots of books that use it and learn its idiosyncracies. There is still surely plenty of scope for creativity in the many other (actually, more important) design choices to be made.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Paul that there are many other factors as (or even more) important to the design of a book as the text typeface. If those other things have been dealt with competently, however, the choice of a typeface can play a key role in determining the &quot;voice&quot;.  <BR> <BR>And, as Gerald implied, the choice of a text typeface is often a very personal one for a book designer.  <BR> <BR>It is tricky to work with a new typeface. I often play for a long time with a new face, before I feel comfortable spec'ing it. When time is tight, I fall back on old favorites because they are reliable in the clutch. <BR> <BR>But someone has to be bold and put these new faces through their paces, so good for you for wanting to explore. <BR> <BR>Hrant did not provide a link above, so allow me to do so. Whitman may be seen and purchased at the Font Bureau site: <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?fontname=Whitman" target="_blank"> <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?fontname=Whitman">www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?fontname=Whitman</a></a>. <BR> <BR>However, online showings are not so helpful for book types. A more extensive PDF specimen is available from my site: <a href="http://www.kentlew.com/Type/" target="_blank"> <a href="http://www.kentlew.com/Type/">www.kentlew.com/Type/</a></a>. The Whitman PDF has several samples in text sizes (9-14 point) with two different leadings. <BR> <BR>Even this is not as good as seeing some real-world uses. Unfortunately, the books that I'm aware of using Whitman are all from relatively small publishers here in the States. I don't know that any of them would be on a UK bookshelf. The most likely would be <i>Extreme Simplicity</i> by Christopher and Dolores Lynn Nyerges (Chelsea Green Publishing Co., 2002). <BR> <BR>I'll go one better than that, though. If Whitman fits your criteria and you would like to seriously consider it, then send me 1000 words of your sample text in plain text format and give me some specs &ndash; trim and margins, or line-length, leading, and number of lines &ndash; and I'll set you some sample pages in a couple sizes and send back a PDF file. <BR> <BR>Best of luck with your project. <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent &ndash; I hope you didn't take my comments as in any way hinting that Whitman would not be suitable. Whitman from what I've seen of it (never, unfortunately, a book) is probably a great text face. What is more, it is in a tradition of other great text faces. I'd love to see it used in some books. <BR> <BR>It really can make all the difference in the world, even with a good typeface, whether it is used or abused. Some perfectly horrible things are done with wonderful fonts; some fairly respectable books can be made with nasty typefaces (though it's harder). <BR> <BR>I wish Jonathan the very best of luck in choosing a font; may he both choose and use well.</div>
