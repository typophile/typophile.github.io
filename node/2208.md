body: I just installed the Adobe Creative Suite, however InDesign and Illustrator
  no longer launch the Suitcase &#40;10.2.2&#41; auto-activation feature, therefore
  I constantly have to manually turn on all the fonts I am working with in a document
  before I open it. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts? <BR> <BR>thanks <BR> <BR>zara

    plug-ins for the CS applications, I&#39;m afraid. I understand they&#39;re working
    on it. <BR> <BR>T

    me where I&#39;m wrong&#41;: <BR> <BR>Suitcase 10.2.2 = SC || FontAgent Pro 1.3
    = FA <BR> <BR>Photoshop 7 - SC yes, FA yes <BR>Illustrator 9,10 - SC yes, FA yes
    <BR>InDesign 2 - SC yes, FA yes <BR>Quark 5 &#40;classic&#41; - SC yes, FA yes
    <BR>Quark 6 &#40;OS X&#41; - SC no, FA yes <BR>All Adobe CS - SC no, FA no &#40;both
    managers plan updates soon&#41; <BR> <BR>Font Book and MasterJuggler do not feature
    any auto activation. <BR> I don&#39;t know much about Font Reserve, but I imagine
    it&#39;s  <BR>not going to be around much longer now that Extensis  <BR>gobbled
    them up. Typographica will have a feature on all  <BR>the OS X font managers in
    a couple weeks.'
