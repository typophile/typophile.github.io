  body: "Bears a strong resemblance to H&FJ's <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/testdriver/displayroman.html\">Requiem</a>,
    although the Ts, with their mini-flourishes, are different. Could have been customized,
    since the same letter in the smaller type along the bottom is a closer match to
    Requiem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
