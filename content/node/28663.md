  body: "I risk vocalizing a thought I had when I looked at the typeface because I'd
    be curious to  hear if others thinks similarly.\r\n\r\nThe way Lanc\xF4me uses
    the typeface it appears lovely and delicate and high fashion. But, when I look
    at the typeface as a whole the same thought doesn't occur. Isn't it wonderful
    what a typeface can do in the right hands?"
