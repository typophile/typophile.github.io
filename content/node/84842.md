  local small fashion agency. i'm so luck that they liked my ideas and solutions,
  which are mostly typography based. some keywords are classy, noble, pink, trustworthy,
  cheerfully, optimistic, genius, spiritual, kind, honest, dignified, aris\xADtocracy...thank
  you so much. "

  body: Reminds me of the time I was asked to create a logo that was traditional,
    but modern.  A lot of conflicting idea going on here.  Maybe Fontesque would be
    a good starting point.  Depends on what kind of store it is.

    or \"aristocratic\" in those fonts listed by marcox or William.\r\n\r\nReally
    a challenge, cause all those qualities aren't usually manifested in the same style
    of type, are they? \r\n\r\nBecause the client is a fashion agency (for women)
    I would tend to offer a more scriptlike and refined type. It depends on what style
    of fashion, of course. From the keywords it sound like they have an upscale clientele."

  body: "Help me out here, I don't get it - what's girly, noble, and aristocratic
    about Archer? Maybe this is a man's point of view. To me it's a modern slab serif
    font with a friendlier look than average, and a nice italic. The hairline might
    be somewhat feminine, if by feminine we mean \"delicate\". \r\n\r\nAnd if it's
    so popular, that means it is not distinctive. A fashion house logo should have
    a distinctive look and style. It isn't just a magazine layout. \r\n\r\nSame with
    Pluto. I bought it and love it, but to me it's not particularly feminine, and
    certainly not classy. To me it has a unpretentious friendly-guy look, being built
    on a rigid vertical base with some curved terminals. It doesn't even have an italic
    version. \r\n\r\nI used it for the text on my husband's birthday present, \"Video
    for a workin' man\":\r\n [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wiv2b2wXjU]]\r\n"

  body: I agree with you about Archer and Pluto. I think the challenge here is having
    something expressing both strength and femininity. I think Bree has some femininity,
    especially in the bold italic. Mark Simonson's Coquette also has strength with
    femininity. It's also cheerful, but I don't think aristocratic. Probably the client
    has to decide which of the qualities is most important, because it's hard to be
    strong in all of them.

  body: "It's unrealistic to expect the typeface to punch all those buttons.\r\nAnother
    strategy is to \"play against type\", i.e. choose a typeface that has some of
    the characteristics, then add those it lacks by means of the setting. \r\nYou
    want strong and girly?\u2014set bold in pink or grunge up an elegant script.\r\nMany
    faces have heavy weights (deemed masculine, for some reason, despite heaviness
    being equal opportunity), and light weights (deemed feminine, notwithstanding
    Peter Crouch), in which case font is more important than face.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bridesmaids-movie-poster-2011-1010695656_3766.jpg]"
