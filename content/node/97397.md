  big bold presence under the name 'press'.\r\n\r\nRanging from large format to business
  cards, they literally cover everything so firstly I would like to get opinions on
  the name itself (if that falls under Typophile jurisdiction - after all, the meaning
  behind the words are what influence the visual execution) and secondly, I was keen
  to get some initial feedback \\ fine-tuning before I develop colours, etc and go
  on to pitch. \r\n\r\nI would consider myself a bit of a novice, but always keen
  to improve, so any and all feedback is welcomed (however scathing it may be).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRoss"

  body: The name has the danger of being too generic sounding that people won't realize
    it is the actual name. From what I am seeing, clerendon is giving a decidedly
    retro feel, which may be your definition of fresh and fitting. Lowering the /e/
    feels a bit too gimmicky to me. Do they want to attract the bargain hunters or
    the 'price is no object' clients?

    body: "Hi Luma,\r\n\r\nThanks for feedback, I suppose I'll start from the top.
      \r\n\r\nBasically, my boss has just bought over two other print companies and
      is currently running them from the same building but under different names.
      I figure this is a great opportunity to take the metaphorical bull by it's metaphorical
      horns and sell him a really nice concept to unify the three (partly for ease
      of running and partly for a little consistency in their approach toward clients).\r\n\r\nAs
      for the company themselves, they will take on any job so long as it's paid,
      big or small. They do quick turnaround on a regular basis if deadlines call
      for it (at the expense of their staff's sanity!) and they rarely make mistakes.
      I think I probably worded it badly in my OP. What I'm really trying to create
      is something bold, reliable and trustworthy. Clarendon's fine balance of 'softened
      solidity ' is what led me to choose it initially. Clarendon does have a retro
      feel, although it strikes me as a face that can be made to appear fresh if treated
      correctly (off-hand I remember seeing a job on Behance for a recruitment company
      called 'nice' that handles Clarendon particularly well).\r\n\r\nI should also
      make it clear that I've purposefully only been working with around 15 sans,
      15 serif and 15 display faces until I get a little more comfortable with each
      (hence the novice remark earlier!) Once these become familiar, I intend to add
      fonts occasionally by way of a treat rather than wading through thousands of
      sub-par fonts and confusing myself in the process.\r\n\r\nThe name itself works
      well as it has all sorts of extensions in terms of copywriting. First im<strong>press</strong>ions
      count and <strong>press</strong>ure on deadline day? Could have all sorts of
      fun with it. On it's own though, it may not have enough merit as you say. Possibly
      needs a prefix of sorts to make it a little more unique.\r\n\r\nWasn't too keen
      on the 'e' lowered myself and had to add a thin stroke around the /p/ and /r/
      to even the balance as /ss/ in Clarendon seems quite heavy. Does it strike you
      as particularly noticeable?\r\n\r\nSorry for the wall of text and appreciate
      the response : ) "

  body: "I agree with Luma - the name is just way too generic. \r\n\r\nIt will be
    very hard to market online, but more importantly it is going to be very hard to
    make it memorable. Say someone notices the company and makes a note to use its
    services when the time comes. How likely do you think that they won't be able
    to tell if it were \"press\" or \"print\" or \"ink\"? Aside from the visuals,
    the logo needs to carry a concept, because in the end of the day that's what's
    getting remembered. Unless of course you are a <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Coca-Cola_logo.svg\">LocaGola</a>
    and can afford to pound an arbitrary image into your customers brain on a daily
    basis. Unfortunately, I think none of your four options has a strong concept behind
    it.\r\n\r\nI'd consider either tweaking the name or tying the logo to the word
    \"press\" in a more direct way."

  body: ">  I figure this is a great opportunity to... \r\n> sell him a really nice

    Having separate companies might be an advantage if they each have their own identity
    and/or appeal to different segments of the market. Plus when a company does a
    merger and changes its name, it might be unnerving to some existing customers.
    And you may end up with some layoffs (such as \"why do we need 3 receptionists
    now that we're one combined company?\")\r\n\r\nNot saying its a bad idea, maybe
    he'll like it, but there are probably pros and cons.\r\n\r\nAgree with the others
    that \"press\" is pretty generic, and would suggest that you look carefully at
    the names and logos of other printers in your region to make sure you come up
    with something different from them."
