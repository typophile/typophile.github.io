body: "The Haskell community is looking for a new logo.\r\n\r\nHaskell is a functional
  programming language, featuring laziness and purity. You don't have to know what
  these mean to help me. The current logo is pretty bad, in my opinion: you can see
  it at [[http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Image:Haskellwiki_logo_big.png]].\r\n\r\nI'd
  appreciate the comments of people from people whose geekiness tends towards design
  rather than mathematics, both on my own logo proposals and (if you have time) other
  proposals at [[http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_logos/New_logo_ideas]].\r\n\r\nExplanation
  of some symbolism: the mathematical theory of monads has had a big impact on Haskell,
  and this uses the operators >> and >>= which appear in some of the logo designs.
  A lowercase lambda is used to denote functions (and, less commonly, an uppercase
  lambda for a related concept of type-function). The language is named after the
  logician Haskell Curry."

  body: In case all the comments about free fonts on that page bother you, please
    note that it's legally tricky for an open-source program to have a non-open-source
    logo. So free means free as in open source, not as in free junk (hopefully).

  body: "The principal comment I have is that the \u03BB-based mark is probably not
    a very good idea simply because Lambda calculus is not unique to Haskell. \r\n\r\nI
    think first two marks in your PDF and ([[http://media.nokrev.com/junk/haskell-logos/logo6.png|this
    mark]]) are good, but they don't really associate with <em>Haskell</em>. Looking
    at the mark it's easy to see it's for one of the functional programming languages,
    but it could be for Erlang for all I care. In fact, the <strong>L</strong>isp
    is going to be a more reasonable guess, because L <em>is</em> \u03BB.\r\n\r\nI
    would probably look at using a wordmark, perhaps working the \u03BB or the >>
    into a negative space of \"Haskell\". At the very least I'd consider working the
    H letter into the graphical mark. The mark needs to be tied to \"Haskell\" somehow.\r\n"

  body: "Well the best ones to my eyes (and seeing them as logos that can be applied
    across various applications and are also memorable) were from \"Jeff Wheeler\"
    and the one that's also posted here from \"Apankrat\".\r\n\r\nI think both of
    them are very similar in style and work well. And if I had to decide between the
    two it would be Jeff's.\r\n\r\nOther's are either not logos at all, to playful/busy/unprofessional...\r\n\r\nBut
    if yours would be the one to progress even further I'd progress... Well I can't
    associate the arc with anything. And if I remove it, I'm with Jeff's version again.
    Well at least the third one is not appropriate.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
