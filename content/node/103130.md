  is creating a social network around entertainment contents, and my design philosophy
  around this product is to create a lasting, more general (than trendy) logo using
  name \"Open.\" The main color scheme will use color Red. With the background in
  red, the letters will more likely to be in white. I'd appreciate any feedback on
  using ITC Bauhaus for the company logo. \r\n\r\nAlso, ITC Bauhaus and ITC Ronda
  are pretty similar, and I'm contemplating which would be a better font for this
  logo. Also feedback would be welcomed!"

    might make the logo look dated, as Bauhaus was used a lot in the 1970s and 80s.
