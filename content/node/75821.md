  be most appreciative.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSabrina\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bbtext_4935.gif]

  body: "This looks like one of the brush sign scripts which URW has digitized, based
    on old photo-lettering typefaces. In the Solotype Catalog there is a whole spectrum
    of these scripts, with all ranges of stroke thickness, slant and lettering styles
    between printed letters and connected script.\r\n\r\nThere was a (bad) collection
    of Expresiv Brush Script fonts sold by Tiger Direct in the 90's that had styles
    like this too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
