body: I&#39;ve been comparing differing versions of a font from two different foundry
  sources, Folio from Adobe in Open Type format and Folio BQ from Berthold in Type
  1 format. <BR> <BR>After converting some letters in each font to outlines, I noticed
  that while the overall shapes are near identical the amount of points used to define
  each glyph is significantly greater in Folio BQ than it is in the Adobe version,
  even on seemingly simple glyph shapes. <BR> <BR>How does this information correlate
  to quality, i.e. how well will each typeface stand up to different printing/viewing
  conditions? My &#40;layman&#39;s&#41; guess would be that a greater number of points
  suggests a sloppier digitization process but I&#39;d appreciate the opinions of
  the cognoscenti. Thanks... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22731.gif"

    about different digitization techniques? <BR> <BR>PostScript, TrueType, IK, they
    all have their advantages and disadvantages. I would never use the term sloppy
    to describe the Folio BQ example, even if it has a few more points. <BR> <BR>It
    is the result of the rendered glyph that matters. No?

  body: James, <BR> <BR>&#62;Since you perceive that the glyph shapes are identical
    does it really matter about different digitization techniques? <BR> <BR>No, you
    misunderstood me. I was not trying to pass judgement on the font or the digitization
    process, in fact &#40;although I did use the term &#39;sloppy&#39;, which I already
    regret&#41; I pointed out that I didn&#39;t know the answer myself. <BR> <BR>I
    was merely trying to find out what difference &#40;if any&#41; the number of points
    used to define a glyph might make in the life of a typeface. <BR> <BR>&#62;It
    is the result of the rendered glyph that matters. No? <BR> <BR>Well, yes, exactly.
    So how does the amount of points affect said rendering?

  body: 'Usually but not always more points means sloppiness. And in this case I think
    that&#39;s what it is, unfortunately. Sometimes though more points means greater
    fidelity. It depends on the design too, like a highly geometric sans will be more
    in tune with bezier-ness, so to speak. <BR> <BR>And other times too few points
    are a problem as well. For example in that Adobe &#34;a&#34; there are a couple
    of missing inflection points: usually this doesn&#39;t matter, but for conversion
    to TT for example it can matter bigtime &#40;especially in Fog&#41;. Other cases
    of extra points being good is for stroke modulation and trapping. <BR> <BR>On
    the other hand, when you apply transformations to outline, the fewer the points
    the better, usually - because the bezier math will take care of it more elegantly
    than explicit points. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>OTOH, the discussion was heading off into an interesting direction,
    namely what advantages if any are achieved by the minimalistic point usage of,
    say, Adobe versus the way that Ikarus turns out Folio BQ. <BR> <BR>To my &#40;uneducated&#41;
    eyes, it seems that there is not one single point in the Adobe version of the
    font that is not absolutely crucial and that could be removed without completely
    wrecking the glyph, yet in the BQ version there are additional points galore.'

  body: 'There are two concerns with large numbers of unnecessary points. The first
    is font size: every point is a certain number of bytes. The more points you have,
    the bigger the font. This may not be a significant factor in 8-bit fonts, but
    when you start including a few thousand glyphs in an OpenType font, the impact
    can be quite considerable. <BR> <BR>The second concern is in TrueType fonts in
    which stray points can cause spikes in delta hinting. If you want to delta a small
    detail to turn a pixel on or off at particular sizes, you ideally want to touch
    only one point, not have to delta three separate points.'

  body: Yes. The more points there are, the more work the computer has to do to image
    the letter. <BR> <BR>They are different means of mathematically describing curves,
    but not quite in the way you&#39;re thinking. You can convert from TrueType style
    quadratic curves to PostScript style cubic beziers without loss of information,
    but not the other way. &#40;A really high-fidelity conversion in the second case
    will require a fair number of added points.&#41; <BR> <BR>Additionally, it is
    common, though not required, to change the em-square scale between 1000 and 2048
    when going between the two styles of curves. This can add slight rounding errors
    and further loss of fidelity. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Wow, lots of good information in this thread, thanks everyone. <BR> <BR>&#62;However,
    there are some situations where it&#39;s necessary, and one of them was the top
    of my Jenson &#40;Goodchild&#41; &#34;a&#34;, where I found it impossible to get
    close to the old master&#39;s form without plenty of points.  <BR> <BR>Well, obviously
    you have to use whatever number of points it takes to achieve the degree of fidelity
    you are after, so while it has become clear in this thread that less points mean
    smaller files and better performance, I was by no means trying to suggest a general
    minimalist imperative. <BR> <BR>However, the initial question was about a direct
    comparison of pretty-damn-near-identical glyph shapes with a significant difference
    in the amount of points used. As it turns out, this appears to be the result of
    an automatic conversion process, which may in turn adversely affect performance.
    <BR> <BR>I would be interested to find out if folks here know of existing guidelines
    or in-house standards for designers or foundry employees concerning point usage
    in the digitization process. <BR> <BR>Has it happened to anyone, that a large
    open type file had to be tidied up afterwards in order to improve performance,
    or is this not a big deal? When is a font file too big?

  body: <i>Has it happened to anyone, that a large open type file had to be tidied
    up afterwards in order to improve performance, or is this not a big deal? When
    is a font file too big?</i> <BR> <BR>This is more of an issue in East Asian fonts,
    where conscientious developers tend to do everything they can to keep the file
    size down &#40;subroutines, small em size, minimum number of points, etc.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>When MS released my Sylfaen font, they ran it through a tool called SplineLab
    &#40;originally from Project Solutions, not sure if it is available from anywhere;
    was expensive&#41; which can automatically clean up excessive points within parameters
    set by the user. I have to say, I&#39;m not very happy with the results, and some
    of my curve quality was lost. Now when I&#39;m developing TT fonts, I usually
    clean up the converted PS-&#62;TT outlines manually and leave points if they are
    necessary to maintain the curve quality. In a longish curve, e.g. a quadrant of
    the O, I can usually reduce the number of FL inserted points from 4 to 2, and
    on short segments from 2 to 1, without a major problem. The longer curves won&#39;t
    be a true match to the original cubic PS outline, but I can control the result
    and it is better than what SplineLab does. Once you get into the habit of doing
    this, it doesn&#39;t take long for each glyph, and I consider it part of the design
    process. <BR> <BR>A bigger concern in developing OpenType fonts is optimising
    performance in the OTL GSUB and GPOS tables. Things like contextual mark positioning
    can slow down processing speeds significantly, so it pays to have a good strategy
    for minimising the number of lookups. Also, GSUB is more efficient than GPOS,
    so it makes sense to try to strike a balance between the efficient development
    and flexibility of GPOS and the faster processing of glyph composition with GSUB.
    In future versions of my Biblical Hebrew font, I&#39;m considering making a few
    hundred of the most commonly occuring letter &#43; mark&#40;s&#41; combinations
    into precomposed glyphs, as this should speed up overall processing.
