  body: "I see a trendy elevator company :)\r\n\r\nSeriously though, there's a very
    strong \"up and down\" reference. And the pattern you have on the Be page looks
    more like a tire thread marks than a sidewalk to me... but in the end it all depends
    what sort of objects this company designs."

    object. \r\nThe two arrows of the logo represents two humans doing \"the awkward
    sidewalk dance\". "

  body: Agree with apankrat's comments. The "up/down" reference could work referencing
    turn signals, but the sidewalk symbol does look more like tire tread marks.

  body: Agree with apankrat's comments. Now that you've explained it I understand
    the "up/down" reference, that could work okay. But the sidewalk symbol does look
    more like tire tread marks. Might work as a background pattern, but don't think
    it works as an icon.
