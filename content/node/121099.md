    \u044B, \u0443. The Serbian letters are incorrect. Because it's a script, it must
    either have Serbian cursive alternates for \u0433, \u043F, \u0442, \u0448 or have
    no Serbian glyphs at all, just not to confuse people."

    discussions forum also to try to get as much feedback as possible, so that I can
    progress with this job.\r\nI gave some feedback here: http://typophile.com/node/121098\r\nWhen
    you say you don't really like \u041B, \u044B, \u0443 do you mean they are incorrect?\r\nDo
    you have any examples of the Serbian cursive alternates for \u0433, \u043F, \u0442,
    \u0448 that show how they should be?\r\n\r\nThe letters in the initial post are
    from MacOS Cyrillic codepages.\r\n\r\n"
