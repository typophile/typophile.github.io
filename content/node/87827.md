body: "With webfonts becoming an ever bigger topic (and market), I have been thinking
  a bit about strategies for designing for the screen from the ground up lately.\r\n\r\nAside
  from obviously different testing procedures throughout the design process, one design
  strategy I've remembered* seems very interesting.\r\n\r\nThe process starts with
  very rough pixel bitmap designs (7x7 or similar). This grid is refined twice or
  three times, and only after this stage, a vector version is designed. This allows
  for a typeface \u2013 in its core \u2013 to be based on the coarse screen grid.
  But then again, this might also lead to very boring, repetitive design patterns.\r\n\r\n<strong>What
  are your experiences, best practices, interesting strategies to design typefaces
  worthy of being called webfonts?</strong> Is there good research out there on this,
  even thesis papers? I am mainly interested in body copy type design that works across
  various sizes, not bitmap typefaces of display screen typefaces.\r\n\r\n*I've first
  read about this in \"ECAL: Typography (We make fonts)\" (2006), where someone used
  this process for a type design workshop with ECAL (University of art and design
  Lausanne, Switzerland) students."

  body: Sorry if this is a duplicate of a good discussion about this topic. I've tried
    searching through Typophile, but couldn't find a thread specifically about this.
    I haven't been active on Typophile recently, so I may have easily missed it. Please
    let me know if I missed an important discussion about this, I'll gladly read that
    and add to the discussion there if I have anything to add.

  body: There are no reasons to make web fonts that fit the pixel grid perfectly.
    But to make things that are aware of the pixel grid makes a great deal of sense.
    This does not need to result in boring or repetitive fonts. Take a very close
    look at what FF and Font Bureau have done recently. Compare this to verdana and
    Georgia and the C* fonts like Cambria and Corbel.
