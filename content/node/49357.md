  been trying to find the font for this wordmark and it's driving me koo-koo bananas...
  \r\n\r\nBest as I can tell, it's fairly close to a Garamond Bold Italic or a Bodoni
  of the same fashion, but neither seems to do the trick. Expert opinions, please
  and thank you!!"

    New Baskerville Bold</a> stretched horizontally a bit (which also accounts for
    the increased slant).
