  i'm usually ok with, but serifs, i just dunno what it is about them, but i can't
  get my head around them enough to id with any conviction. \r\n\r\nis this normal?\r\n\r\nhow
  does it work for you?"

  body: depends on how specific the font is i guess, but i do think with a serif there
    are points of recognition

  body: 'i guess that kinda what frustrates me, is that is seems serifs would be easier
    to id as they have mode things that can be used to id them, whereas sans have
    less points of difference... or places to be different... '

    all day ;)\r\n-if it comes to classics like Garamond-like, Century-like, Scotch-like,
    Transitional typefaces, it's hard to differ the many interpretations/versions
    of all the different foundries.\r\n-the textface examples shown here are often
    in pretty bad quality \u2013 small size, bad photographies etc.\r\n-a lot of the
    wonderful contemporary serif designs are not widespread enough, that an average
    designer like me knows them.\r\n"
