    planning on using open type to implement the alternate glyph variants?

  body: At the moment it is set up as two fonts in the same family with the fully
    round letters in place of upper case for each of the fonts, I have no plans for
    using open type, although it might be something for the future when I&#39;m happier
    with the way it looks. <BR>As for the numerals, I tried out various ways of keeping
    in with the rounded style but the results were confusing &#40;as were the original
    drawings for i, j and l&#41; and I considered the best answer was to keep them
    as basic, following a similar weight. <BR>Tim

  body: Ok.  I can accept that.  My only suggestion is that since you have this implemented
    as two separate font files, that gives you the option of having both classic and
    matching number forms.  My criteria on a display face such as this would be whether
    I could write everything I wanted.  As is, I couldn&#39;t use Clam if I needed
    to write a date because the numbers don&#39;t sylistically match the letters -
    so what&#39;s the point? <BR> <BR>I guess I&#39;m strongly urging you to consider
    at least making numbers that match as an option.  Also, in thinking about the
    open type features for Arabic, &#42;if you wanted&#42;, you could probably use
    the initial, medial, and terminal form support to map out the different glyph
    variants in Clam.

    but maybe I should perservere. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24997.jpg"
    alt="numerals"> <BR>However, I feel that the current numerals do work with the
    characters, maybe not as a direct connection in style &#40;although they do need
    work 1,5,7 need to be reduced in height&#41;. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24998.jpg"

    <BR>I think you should use those new numerals to make it a whole. Nice work!'
