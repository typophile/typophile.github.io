  also seem a bit thicker than other fonts like this.  There are many fonts like this,
  but I can't seem to find this exact one.\r\n\r\nIts not College, College Slab, Collegiate,
  or Freshman\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/txt2_6743.png]\r\n\r\nthanks

  body: That wasn't in your sample. Where did your sample come from, and if you're
    that specific (I wanted to say "picky") then it would help if you provided all
    of the needed information.   - Herb
