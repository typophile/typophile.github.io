  />\r\n\r\nNew from ReType, Medusa is Ramiro Espinoza\u2019s homage to one of the
  most renowned masters of Spanish calligraphy, Ram\xF3n Stirling, who was active
  in Barcelona during the 19th century. Not much is known about his life, and there
  is even some doubt as to his real name, but his Bellezas de la Caligraf\xEDa (Beauties
  of Calligraphy) is one of the most exquisite English roundhand manuals ever produced.\r\nThe
  starting-off point in the creation of the typeface was an analysis of the historical
  models of formal English handwriting and the ways in which those styles had been
  adapted to the typographic technologies of different eras. A representative example
  of such adaptations involves the group of letters which, in connected scripts, join
  from near the top of their x-height, namely \u201Cb\u201D, \u201Co\u201D, \r\n\u201Cv\u201D
  and \u201Cw\u201D.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.re-type.com/newsletter/retype/images/bickham-sample.png\"
  \ />\r\n\r\n<em>Model from The Universal Penman (1740) </em>\r\n\r\nUp to now, all
  typefaces derived from the roundhand have been simplified so that the above letters
  connect with the following glyphs from the middle of their x-height. Unfortunately,
  this solution produces an artificial, awkward appearance, far removed from the beauty
  of the canon of the golden age of commercial handwriting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.re-type.com/newsletter/retype/images/newsletter-img-01.png\"
  \ />\r\n\r\n<em>Letters typically adapted for typography     A more authentically
  calligraphic approach </em>\r\n\r\nNowadays, the OpenType format affords the possibility
  of solving this problem. Instructions can be programmed into a font to automatically
  select the appropriate alternate glyphs as the user types. Despite the existence
  of this option, no one has yet published a copperplate typeface that is a faithful
  reflection of historical writing models, connecting \u201Cb\u201D, \u201Co\u201D,
  \u201Cv\u201D and \u201Cw\u201D in the correct manner. Extra effort is required
  to program and design the many alternate character sequences necessary, and this
  has not been implemented by type foundries accustomed, as also are type users, to
  the familiar faux convention.\r\nAt ReType we decided to move in the opposite direction.
  We didn\u2019t force the shape of hard-to-format letters into the service of technology,
  but rather resolved to press technology into the service of respecting the original
  graceful quality of those letters.\r\nMedusa is much more than a mere digital transfer
  of Ram\xF3n Stirling\u2019s model. Several of the original letters, such as \u201Cf\u201D,
  \u201Cs\u201D and \u201Cz,\u201D whose appearance was somewhat weaker, have been
  replaced by designs based on Espinoza\u2019s own accomplished pointed nib calligraphy.\r\n\r\n<img

  addition, numerous elements lacking in Stirling\u2019s book have been added. The
  fantastically ornate capitals were redrawn in order to strike a greater balance
  and enhance the consistency of the set of letters as a whole. Several swashes and
  ligatures were also created from scratch, but with an unwavering respect for the
  formal rules of pointed pen calligraphy to ensure that their ductus was correct.
  Perhaps the most unusual feature of Medusa is its small caps, which have been carefully
  designed to produce an all-cap setting that is stylistically harmonious with the
  classic copperplate script, something which has up to now been missing from this
  genre of typeface. \r\nFinally, we are offering a separate set of modular swashes
  that enable complex decorative headings and cartouches. \r\nWe are pleased to say
  that Medusa is a complete script system the unique features of which will lend elegance
  and sophistication to a wide variety of design projects. \r\n\r\nwww.Re-Type.com\r\n\r\n<img

  body: Hi ramiro, awesome to finally see this finished :) I could tell you it's a
    beautiful typeface, but you already know that. The thing is, I never really cared
    for script fonts, and you just changed that. This is a revolution in script typography.
    Cheers!
