body: "i need some advice regarding the indents (and a few other things) on a some
  pages for a book about leaving america to live abroad.\r\ni previously posted pages
  from this book in regards to a different issue here: http://typophile.com/node/27559\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>
  <li>do you think the indents are too wide on the section under the blue box(moving
  there)? i did this so that indent on the lower section would align with the edge
  of the text on the upper section. when i reduced the indent, it didn't look too
  good. \r\n\r\ni guess i might reduce the margins on the lower section to more closely
  align with the upper section, but unfortunately, i am in the final stage of design
  with this book and i can't really change things too drastically (344 page count
  is fixed at this point).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getting_out_135_4435.jpg]\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>what
  is your advice here? the line about crime is too long to fit on one line w/o creating
  a widow. i tried reducing the tracking -5 (using InDesign), but i still got the
  widow. so i made a soft return, but then the word spacing looks terrible. is there
  anything that can be done?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getting_out_225_5077.jpg]</li>\r\n\r\n<li>also,
  i am looking for a different font to display URLs. i am currently using knockout
  junior cruiserwt, but i'm not crazy about it in this context. the font needs to
  work well with both franklin gothic book and triplex serif\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getting_out_290_4378.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getting_out_73_3590.jpg]</li>\r\n\r\n<li>and
  finally, i am wondering what your advice would be regarding indents on this resource
  section in the appendix. do you think this would benefit from indents?  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getting_out_311_4432.jpg]</li>
  </ol>\r\n\r\nthanks for any advice!\r\n\r\ngregg"

  body: "1. A lot of times, things that align metrically can actually not appear to
    align visually. I suspect that this was due to the rounded edge and the color
    of that box. Personally, I'm leaning more toward the visually aligned solution;
    so I would reduce the margin a little bit, and then use H&J to compensate for
    the lost words. Franklin Gothic's counters are open, too. I think they could withstand
    some wordspacing adjustments.\r\n\r\n2. I think that the rule on widow is not
    hard-and-fast. In this case, it is fine, especially since <em>harrasment</em>
    is quite long of a word. Speaking about which, the Other woman's issues section
    got a short <em>wives</em>. Now that's a widow allright.\r\n\r\n3. I would use
    the existing Triplex serif, set at visually the same x-height as Franklin Gothic.
    It is distinctive enough to be noticeable among the line of text, yet would still
    provide some continuity with the context of the book.\r\n\r\n4. I don't think
    so. One or two visual marker to distinguish between one entry and another (in
    this case, resources set in Bold and leading between entries) are usually enough.\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck!"

    like the x-height is smaller than that of franklin gothic, so to match it would
    you just increase the point size?"

  body: "Yes I think the indents are too wide. It doesnt feel right to me.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    remove the indent, and have a 1-3pt spacing after the last line in a paragraph
    to spatially separate sections? Removal of the indent should help towards compensating
    the 1-3pt line space lost.\r\n\r\nThe appendix looks good without the indent.
    The hook is the bold, not the indent."

  body: "It seems you have several ways of treating lists:\r\n1. outdented first line,
    ranged left, ragged right\r\n2. indented first line, justified\r\n3. ranged left,
    ragged right, line spaced\r\nThe consistency seems to come from having the first
    word(s) in bold. My taste would be to use the bold as the indicator and range
    left with ragged right on a slightly narrower measure (taken from left and right),
    not being justified you have greater flexibilty to takeover words to reduce the
    incidence of widows and not being indented means that the shorter definitions
    would decrease the stepping effect on the left. You might feel that it needs a
    little extra linespacing after each entry and if you can do this without adding
    too many pages it is worth considering.\r\nTim"

  body: "I think the indents in the main text are too deep. I'd make them the same
    as the indents in the blue box.\r\n\r\nAgree that boldface and indents may be
    overkill. For readability I'd either flush the whole thing left or do a hanging
    indent (what Tim calls an oudent - I'm not familiar with that term) the way you
    do inside the blue box.\r\n\r\nI think the urls aren't quite working - would either
    boldface them in the Franklin Gothic or try the blue. Depends on how much attention
    you want to draw to them.\r\n\r\nI like the look of the resource section, it's
    clean and easy to read. No need for indents."

  body: "1. Indents should be equal to the leading.\r\n\r\n2. A word on a line by
    itself is NOT a widow. It is a widow ony when it jumps to the next page. You should
    NEVER track type in text. Adjust your word (not letter) spacing if necessary,
    but it always looks bad if you if you change your constants -- size, leading,
    letter spacing -- to fit text.\r\n\r\n3. Use Franklin Gothic for your URLs. Make
    them bold if you want them to stand out.\r\n\r\n4. There is no need to indent
    the resource section. You have already set off each entry with a blank line."

    construct, surprisingly it is appears in Bringhurst:)\r\n\r\nIndents \u2013 for
    long paragraphs 2 ems is better looking to me but for shorter ones 1 lead or 1
    em (or even an en) will reduce the jaggedness, but in this case I think the bold
    and indent is an overkill. \r\nAlthough in traditional typesetting parlance a
    widow is the last line of a paragraph on the next page, it is frequently used
    for a single word at the end of a paragraph, at least in the UK. I also believe
    that some tracking is permissable, the amount would vary according to the typeface.
    On the resource section where it is set ragged right I would look at turning over
    some of the shorter words (three characters or less), especially where the lines
    above and below fall short of the measure.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Tim - I don't 'insert' an indent but rather set it up in a style sheet or
    formatting menu. It isn't a character. Thus it's actually easier to insert a point
    value, say 14, then an em space. But I guess you're referring to lead type which
    is a different story. Back in the old typesetting days I used to use em-spaces
    (that handy square) for indents in my speccing but that feels kind of obsolete
    since only a traditional typesetter would know the width of an em.

    composing rather than the magic of technology which allows one to create as many
    style sheets as you need. I am disappointed that more book designers don't set
    a style for paragraphs that takes into account quotemarks at the beginning of
    a para, so that all paras could appear to start at the same position.\r\nTim"
