body: 'I want to buy <a href="http://youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0016">this
  font</a> which is offered in two formats: &#34;Macintosh Postscript&#34; and &#34;Windows
  Truetype&#34;. I want to get a postscript font if possible, but I want it to be
  usable on PCs as well. Is Macintosh Postscript really only for Macintosh? Would
  it be impolite to ask the company for a Windows Postscript font?'

  body: It would not be impolite to ask YWFT for a Windows PS. I bet <BR>they can
    deliver it. Even better, ask them to release fonts in <BR>OpenType format, which
    would allow you to use the same <BR>font file on both platforms.
