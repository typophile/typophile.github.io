  body: Love their packaging design too. Figured I would throw that in considering
    this site! I believe that tyhe logo is hand written! Just trying to keep it topical!

    for spamming the forums and start billing the marketing firms that post this stuff.

  body: "One could argue that the opening scene in this trailer is related to typography,
    therefore it is completely relevant here :)\r\n\r\nI, for one, am <cite>very</cite>
    excited about this film. I have been a big fan for a few years and this documentary
    looks exhilarating. "

  body: "I won an award for this photograph of Sigur R\xF3s. I still have the press
    pass stuck to my laptop.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sigur-ros_6450.jpg]\r\n\r\nTheir
    album designs almost remind me of stuff like Joy Division or Bauhaus' first album.
    Very sparse and minimal, but with a kind of heaviness to them.\r\n\r\nThis movie
    is the only movie I've been looking forward to all year."
