  what I've got so far.\r\n\r\nI'm (obviously) having difficulty with 'c' and even
  more difficulty with 'e'. There are probably even more flaws that I'm just not seeing
  right now, but once they are pointed out to me I'll be able to improve.\r\n\r\nAll
  criticism is greatly appreciated, thank you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bucko_4460.gif]"

  body: "I like the conversation \"n\" and \"o\" are starting - it's actually quite
    promising.\r\n\r\nThe \"c\" actually seems not too far from a decent form; the
    \"e\" though needs to be rethought.\r\n\r\nMy main question would be: how \"dorky\"
    do you want this to be? Do you want the overall texture to be dorky (due mostly
    to those nice heavy serifs) or do you want individual glyphs to stand out as dorky?
    If it's the latter, I would say keep the unusually low and left-sitting tittle,
    the too-heavy beak of the \"r\", etc.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nAs far as \"dorkiness\" goes, I'm okay
      with this being fairly dorky/whimsical looking. I would rather have the overall
      texture look dorky than have the specific glyphs stand out. Maybe I'll modify
      the tittle a bit -- now that you've mentioned it sitting low, it seems a bit
      _too_ low.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for how to fix the 'e'? I've started it from
      scratch several times now, without any significant improvements.\r\n\r\n(This
      is the first time I've used \"dorky\" while talking about typefaces!)"

    spacing around it rather than widening. '

  body: You're right -- the 'o' is a bit too narrow. Someone else just pointed that
    out to me too. The curve of the 'c' looks a bit nicer, I think, and I'll probably
    redo my 'o' based on that.

  body: I agree about the 'o' the 'c' looks fine to me, overall this is a very promising
    project mate good luck!
