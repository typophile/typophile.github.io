  photography monograph.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lucy_fur110a.jpg]\r\n\r\ni
  am curious about a couple of things:\r\n\r\n- is the placement and size of the drop-cap
  acceptable?\r\n- does the phrase that is set in small caps, false-ilalics work?
  i am using adobe garamond and i skewed it 13 degrees. it didn't look quite right
  to me with small caps roman preceding the rest of the italic text. do you think
  this is ok or should i set it in italics like the rest of the text?\r\n- the text
  block is 4.2 inches. do you think that is too wide? \r\n\r\nthe page dimensions
  are 10x10 inches and the type is 11/14\r\n\r\n\r\nany advice and recommendations
  are greatly appreciated\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\ngregg"

  body: "Too much air around the drop cap. I'd nudge it closer to the type so that
    it reads as part of the first word.\r\n\r\nand... it's so much nicer to make it
    a jpeg than to force us to download pdf files."

  body: Yes, that's a lot better. You could even see how it looks even closer to the
    text so that the T overlaps a bit. One other small tweak - the period after Bird
    ALMOST aligns perfectly with the period after "same" at the end, you could adjust
    spacing in the last line so that they do.

  body: "I would look at moving the T more to the right, the consequence should be
    to take room over and tighten up some of the space in that second line, I would
    then try to align the first and second lines to the angle of the T's vertical.\r\nTim"
