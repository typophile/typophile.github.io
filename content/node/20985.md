  mostly animation of hand-drawn \"IF\" --\r\n\r\nThis link takes you to the <a href=\"http://www.metlife.com/MetNewsFeed/0,5018,12232,00.html?location=HomePageUnit1&bannerad=MainIFBanner\"
  target=\"new\">main \"IF\" page</a>. Play with the mouse-overs on various \"ifs\".\r\n\r\nThen
  click the \"Watch T.V.\" link in the upper right corner to watch the TV spot.\r\n\r\nTrying
  to find out who actually did the creative on the spot, but the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/business/media/21adco.html\"
  target=\"new\">New York Times</a> credits both Foote Cone (business-to-business)
  and Y&R Advertising in New York (consumer) as MetLife's agencies. "

  body: Pretty cool. Some of the IFs on the web page seem hand drawn, some are fonts.
    Please someone hold me back from attempting to identify them all. I already wasted
    a Saturday afternoon on the "Thank You For Smoking" titles.
