<div class=commentbody>No not really. <br>There are some small rudimental programs able to create text effects an such stuff.

<div class=commentbody>Adobe once had a program, but that is discontinued. I have a notion, though, that it won't be the last time Adobe will try to underminde Macromedia here.. it must irk them to no end that in THIS design area, another company holds a semi-monopol. <br> <br>Corel, as far as I know, has a tool, but that is rather miserable, from what I hear. <br> <br>Freehand can do very simple swfs, but these are only okay for simple animations (which is what some illustrators use it for, as the layer-technique s very similar to Photoshop and traditional animatoion, so they're used to it... also the editing tools are better than in Flash). <br> <br>And finally, there is Swish, which started as a simple text-animationtool but has pretty much evolved and nowadays can do some stuff. It's nowhere near as powerful as Flash is, especially when it comes to scripting (which is the key to making solid Flash-websites, without Action Script you don't get anywhere). However, I really like SwishMax as a simple presentation tool or for online banners and all that, as the interface is simpler and the everyday stuff, like fades and so on), is quicker done. It's not a professional tool, at only 99 $ it doesn't have to be, but simpler stuff is quickly done here and the new version actually offers pretty solid typography, alas nowhere near the real typo capabilities of flash (which still are lightyears behind Photoshop or InDesign or even Freehand). you can download a demo at <a href=http://www.swishzone.com target=_blank>www.swishzone.com</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>You can also make simple animated GIFs with Fireworks, which may be more your style, because it is "frame by frame" rather than "timelines" (I'm talking about v.3, which is what I use, so I hope it hasn't changed hugely). Also the final files are really small, and don't need plug-ins to play back, so ideal for banners.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the suggestions. I did look into Adobe's LiveMotion, but since they discontinued it, I'd rather not trot down that path. <br> <br>There are several reasons I've grown to dislike Flash (in my limited time using it). One "for instance" is it's inability to properly display imported (bitmap) images. I cannot find a way to make it NOT compress them. If I have a 1px white line on a black background, imported into Flash, I want that 1px white line to look like a 1px white line. Flash always seems to want to compress it and make it look antialiased. <br> <br>That is, perhaps, a clumsy example, since I could just make a line in Flash itself... but what if I don't want to? <br> <br>Another reason I'd like to find an alternative, is because I've grown used to Adobe AfterEffect's interpolations techniques (since I have a background in video). The way Flash "tweens" between keyframes is really clunky. Maybe I just don't know enough, but I've spent hours in this program trying to learn it... you'd think I'da figured it out by now. <br> <br>Anyway... I appreciate the suggestions. I'll have a look. (I have a feeling I'll be waiting for another program to be introduced.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, flash has some issues with bitmaps. <br>Some tips though. <br> <br>Make sure your images top-left corner is on a even pixel. Use the propertiesarea to manually set the bitmap position to a non decimal number. Also make sure that the numbers starts from top-left and not the center. You control that with the square with nine subsquares inside. <br> <br>Well anyway flash has a really really steep learningcurve. I have worked with it since version 2 and there are still things that I learn (if you except the scripting wich I never will learn good enough). <br> <br>/fredde</div>

<div class=commentbody>FYI, while MM 'owns' the FLA format, it also has opened the SWF format up, so anyone that wants to can program that into their software as an export format. Swish was mentioned. Another may be some of the animation-centric apps out there such as Toon Boom: <a href=http://www.toonboomstudio.com target=_blank>http://www.toonboomstudio.com</a> <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Flash can be off-putting. But you just have to understand how it works with Vectors and Bitmaps. Each image CAN have its own compression (in library > symbol properties). Because flash is a scalable format, like Fredrik said, your pixel line was not snapped to a pixel. <br> <br>Overall it's quite a sensible application. These aren't bugs in the program, just misunderstandings, don't treat it like a graphics app. <br> <br>><i>The way Flash "tweens" between keyframes is really clunky.</i> <br> <br>Don't tween in Flash. <br> <br>><i>Maybe I just don't know enough, but I've spent hours in this program trying to learn it... you'd think I'da figured it out by now. </i> <br> <br>Don't make me laugh. I've spent 5 years in this program and still don't understand a lot of it. Just stick with it, and in a few weeks you'll be flying. I think it would be a waste of time trying other applications, cos you'll reach a stage where you can't go any further, then you'll be forced to start learning Flash from the beginning. There are plenty of websites and tutorials for learning.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, Director's great. Unfortunately it doesn't do the vector tricks that Flash can. Although, I've read that you can drop Flash stuff into Director. Soon, my company's getting us Director MX and Flash MX and I'll be able to say for sure. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>Oh, it's not really an optimal web development platform, but it can output Shockwave.</div>

<div class=commentbody>There is a very well know raster image bug with flash. It has apparently been corrected with the latest release as long as you're publishing a version 7 swf. So it still presents itself as a problem because not everyone's ready to deploy version 7 swfs. <br> <br>Here's a page detailing the bug and a workaround for it. <br><a href=http://www.fatorcaos.com.br/flashimagebug/ target=_blank>http://www.fatorcaos.com.br/flashimagebug/</a> <br>There is still no way to prevent this from happening when using dynamically loaded jpgs with a version 6 swf.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nic, that is a nice site you made there. I haven't really checked it out too much. The navigation is what I really liked, it keeps the parent & sibling navigation available while also provides a breadcrumb trail. Good thinking. <br> <br>But after briefly looking at your personal site I have to say who needs flash? ;) You've got your external content loading without a page refresh and alpha fades between images. That's nice, but of course for the really fancy stuff flash is still handy. Anyway, that looks like some nice work you have on your site, I'll probably take a little time to look through it more.</div>

I'm mostly curious (and looking at my old post, I didn't say this at all) in how the background scales while the other elements remain static. <br> <br>Perhaps this is for another thread or a private conversation, but I'm too new for these mores, appologies <br> <br>Aaron</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is getting a bit off topic, but i suppose it's flash promoting over other apps. <br> <br><a href=http://www.macromedia.com target=_blank>macromedia.com</a> is a great resource for learning and you can't beat the help files for scripting. I also reccommend <a href=http://www.were-here.com/forum/ target=_blank>this forum</a> for learning tricks. <br> <br>You need something like <a href=http://livedocs.macromedia.com/flash/mx2004/main/12_as584.htm target=_blank>this</a> to resize your movie. In them brackets { ... } you can tell it what to do when resized, for instance, recalculate and redraw the background elements. <br> <br>The bug should be fixed now. Thanks <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Look, flash *can* do whatever you want in a SWF file, although it has lots of quircks (sp?) you have to get used to, lots of tricks that doesn't make sense to make things work (the image bug is one of them). You can actually paste and use your image the way you want it (I don't know what exactly your</div>

<div class=commentbody>... speaking of MM Studio MX 2004, has anyone noticed a huge speed decrease in normal operation? I downloaded the demo for Dreamweaver and it's barely usable. <br> <br>I'm on a 17-inch PowerBook G4 (1ghz, 1gb RAM, OS 10.3).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Most of MX 2004 is difficult to use on slower machines (well, it even struggles on good machines), probably because of their new window/tab system and their heavy shaded graphics on the interface. <br> <br>Macromedia have released an <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=34415274143" target=_blank> online survey</a> to help fix the problem.</div>
