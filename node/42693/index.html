  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>My brother and I are planning on doing some creative work together&hellip; for fun initially. Later on we may try to sell merchandise like t-shirts, posters, etc.</p>
<p>The name brilliant nonsense has been floating around in my brother&rsquo;s head for years. I liked it so we&rsquo;ve decided to use it for our collaborative work.  I&rsquo;ve been charged with coming up with a logo. Originally we were focused on doing a crest but I wasn&rsquo;t really loving the direction. Later I decided to try scribbling&hellip; playing off of nonsense. I scribbled and scribbled and then combined a few. We both really liked the one you see here.</p>
<p>Now I am trying to pair the logo with type and I need some help. All of the fonts here have the feel I&rsquo;m looking for, but the more I look at the word brilliant the stranger it looks to me&hellip;something about all those i&rsquo;s and l&rsquo;s in a row. I&rsquo;m thinking the 2nd and the last may work better for this word. What do you think? Is there a better font for this? I&rsquo;ve also been wondering if a formal serif might be interesting&hellip;contrasting the playfulness of the name with the formality of type. I may have to try that.</p>
<p>I welcome all comments. Your help is greatly appreciated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>great name. the name alone would catch my eye, so you&rsquo;re home free !</p>
<p>just a few quick thoughts : the scribble is nice but very dense - it could block up in certain media and might benefit from cheating those spaces a little bigger.</p>
<p>the formality of font vs. concept could work but these fonts look formal to me as much as they conjure the kindler, gentler pseudo-formality brought into play with these styles (officina, etc.) in the last decade or so&hellip;  casual fridays fonts. 
very useful style but possibly too familiar for this.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not as well versed in fonts as most folks here but i would suggest going MORE formal, to really push the tongue-in-cheek irony. high classical, or over-the-top decorative, or old world. might not work w/ the scribble, tho.  what about scribbling the font, precisely bounded as if within a stencil ? just a thought.</p>
<p>or : did you try a more surprising combination of fonts ? not so much &ldquo;ransom note&rdquo; but more quirky, an out-of-place combo of two styles ? this was much abused in the 90&rsquo;s, i know, but somehow i think these words could support it with some experimenting.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is very playful.  I like the type in the fourth the best .. like the second, the shape of the L&rsquo;s help to set them apart from the i&rsquo;s.  But the fourth is a better font.</p>
<p>Overall, I get a mad scientist sort of vibe off of it, which is very cool.  You may want to find some type that draws out that sense a little better than what you have (while nice, your choices are neutral).</p>

<p>I missed your comment earlier. We were probably typing at the same time. I like your take on it. I think gravitated toward sophisto and stratum initially because I was going for a scientist vibe&hellip; without fully realizing it. We&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;m going to try both directions. Hopefully I can post again tomorrow.</p>
