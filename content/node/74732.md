  often departs from the lowercase roman? Did anyone ever try a different approach? '

  body: "I do believe so. From Robert Slimbach, Minion Italic has true italic capitals
    (as swash cap variants). It seems somewhat unusual to depart from slanted roman
    for italic caps, regardless of whether it's serifs or sans. Although, I don't
    see why it is so uncommon. For the most part, italic caps are either slanted or
    swash, although they don't quite have to be either, in my opinion. [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=auto&id2=info|Auto,]]
    the triple italic sans serif by Underware does seem to have achieved some visibly
    cursive italic capitals in italic 2, without being ostentatiously swashy. Even
    italic 1 has some forms that vary from the roman. Italic 3, of course, has lots
    of swash and attitude to it.\r\n\r\nWith [[http://typophile.com/node/74121|Neuton's]]second
    italic, I'm going to have capitals with a noticeably cursive disposition is structure,
    and the serifs will have modified serifs that are also leaning more towards cursive,
    although not so obviously. I do not yet have examples of the digitized yet, although
    it's in my sketches. The first italic will have more traditional slanted capitals.\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure there are other fonts that take a more cursive approach to the italic capitals."

  body: I think the drawback in using cursive shapes for uppercase italics is that
    they would look clumsy in an all-caps word.

  body: "Many typefaces also have swashed lowercase. They primarly serve a decorative
    purpose (at least in modern typography) but obviously have more in common with
    cursive lc than slanted roman capitals. What I\u2019m talking about is something
    cursive in construction, but not necessarily as expressive as swashed capitals.
    \r\n\r\nDidn\u2019t some early italics have upright roman capitals? Did we just
    slant them and leave it at that? \r\n\r\nAuto Italic 2 is very interesting, btw.
    I hadn\u2019t noticed those caps before.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think the lowercase, with its roots in pen-drawn forms, simply accomodates
    cursive adaptation better than the inscription-based capital forms.

  body: "@frode, Yeah, I thought you were more talking about cursive structure than
    with swash forms. I think the early italic capitals were simply roman capitals,
    and then later started to be slanted. Don't quote me on this, but I believe I
    read Baskerville was the first to use swash capitals. Although, I might be confusing
    that with Caslon. (Or am remembering wrong.)\r\n\r\nAuto Italic 2 caps definitely
    are a good variation on the norm.\r\n\r\n@riccard0 Hmm, you do have a point about
    the more cursive capitals working less well in lines of caps. Contextual alternates
    for all-cap settings?"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/swashy_5304.png]\r\nMany typefaces have
    a set of swash capitals as alternates, intended for use in U&lc setting (1, Caslon).\r\nBut
    that doesn't work for all caps (2), which is why they're alternates.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    some types have implemented the swash form into some characters, e.g. Baskerville
    (3), and several of Goudy's types.\r\n\r\nRobert Slimbach created a full set of
    \"all-cap-able\" swash caps for Minion (4). I suspect that the way InDesign functions
    had some bearing on that.\r\n\r\nI like that idea too, which I came to when working
    on Fontesque (7), which uses the swash form as the default for caps.\r\n\r\nI've
    also implemented it in the swash caps of Oneleigh (5) and Scotch Modern (6)"
