As for the lc u, that was probably due to not paying a lot of attention ;-) It seems a bit odd now, but I&rsquo;m not really sure it actually bothers me… I&rsquo;ll have to make a comparison first &amp; let it rest a while before I decide (when you work on something for too long, you can&rsquo;t see the forest for the trees anymore). I&rsquo;m still working on more swash variations &amp; after that I&rsquo;ll take a break from Minimade for a couple of days.
The length of the ascenders however wás a deliberate choice. Along with the x-height &amp; descenders, it was the only thing I had already determined when I started this. I didn&rsquo;t want it to end up looking too jagged, so I used the same measurements everywhere which I like to think it adds a little personality (or maybe amateurism? ;-p) to the font.
If anything, I think the descenders could benifit from an extra pixel, but again, I wanted to keep it simple.</div>

<p>At this low res leaving them equal isn&rsquo;t so bad, but making the descenders <em>longer</em> than the ascenders would be a pretty bad use of the vertical space. The simply reason is that in real text ascenders are much much more frequent.</p>

<p>You see, that&rsquo;s why Typophile is very usefull for people like me who have no educational background in typography. When designing I don&rsquo;t even think about these things, but from now on it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll keep in mind.</p>
<p>Since I started fooling around in Fontographer a couple of years ago, I already see some progress in my work.
Pixelfonts are actually great for learning about typedesign; they don&rsquo;t leave you with too much room for choice (or in other words, they eliminate a large part of  doubt) which I find quite stimulating, it justifies a mathematical approach (which again simplifies things) &amp; its simplicity &amp; sheer size can camouflage (or compensate for) a lack of know-how.
Thanks to the comments here, I&rsquo;m also learning a lot about the relationships between characters &amp; the actual use of a font.</p>

<p>Well, in this thread Underware in particular, but in general I&rsquo;m talking about designers who believe that their favorite world order is more important than the results. It&rsquo;s a justification of creation over function, which is Art and not Design.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree (although many designers do loathe them). Besides the paradoxically refreshing limiting of choice, there is a purity to bitmap font design; something that makes you think in a certain healthy way that vector-editing tends to obscure. Maybe it&rsquo;s because the illusion is fully broken, so you can see -or at least feel- the heart of the matter.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I can imagine some typedesigners loathe pixelfonts, but in terms of designing is apples &amp; oranges. It may be easier (especially to start with), but it takes a completely different state of mind.
I love vectors for their flexibility &amp; &lsquo;weightlessness&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s something very different. Pixels are not just about stripping down an image to its core, it&rsquo;s much more than that. The illusion is indeed broken, but you create an entirely new one with the right use of pixels (e.g. creating rounded shapes by pixelplacement). It has a lot to do with &lsquo;feeling&rsquo; where all the pixels should (or should nót) go -much as bezierpoints in vectorial design- &amp; it requires more thinking outside the box than vectors. Even though it may seem very technical, only by breaking the rules can you achieve a perfect bitmap.
For someone who&rsquo;s used to working with vectors, it demands a lot of flexibility on the designer&rsquo;s part.
At least, that&rsquo;s my experience…</div>

As mentioned before, I made some more swashes &amp; divided them into two fonts for practical reasons. I also added a bold, italic &amp; swash version to the Minimade Mini family.

<li>I would remove the inside pixel from the bottom-right of the &ldquo;N&rdquo;.</li>

<li>Because your &ldquo;a&rdquo; is binocular I don&rsquo;t think you need that ungainly pixel at the bottom of the &ldquo;ae&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The eszet might look better with a smaller top bowl.</li>

		<div class="commentbody">I added a few pangrams. Mind you, I haven&rsquo;t done my kerning yet which is definitely necessary for the italics.
The 2 hasn&rsquo;t changed since the very beginning, I was quite pleased with it myself ;-)
Your comments make a lot of sense although I like the eszet as it is.
The N would probably look &lsquo;cleaner&rsquo; without that corner pixel &amp; I hadn&rsquo;t thought of giving the y a bottom serif, but it might improve if I do.
The æ is where I got caught up in my own rules (simply a + e pushed together) rather than &lsquo;flexible&rsquo; aesthetics ;-)
I had to look up what a pilcrow is… Still learning.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for putting up some text. I think it&rsquo;s coming together very well, and the swashes are wonderful; used judiciously they could really mark some new ground.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re OK with the double serifs on the &ldquo;u&rdquo; after all, but I&rsquo;m starting to feel more strongly about your ascenders being too short. I&rsquo;d love to find out what others think, but personally I can almost hear the font wheezing from being put in a straight-jacket! Giving the ascenders one more pixel would really help. I promise.  :-)</p>
<p>Some other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It just hit me that your Bold is three pixels heavy. Did you make one that was two pixels but didn&rsquo;t like it?</li>
<li>Your smaller size is generic enough not to warrant making&hellip; except for the swashes! So pay extra attention to them at that size.</li>

		<div class="commentbody">I admit I got a little sloppy at the end; I just used the same swashes for the mini-version as I did for the regular which obviously makes the balance shift.
The 3-pixel bold was a deliberate choice since I wanted to make a bigger contrast than I could do with only 2 pixels. It looks more like a black version now &amp; I might rename it later if I decide to include a 2-pixel bold as well. For the mini-version I did however reduced it to 2 pixels &lsquo;cause the dimensions of the characters would have to be to stretched too much to fit in the 3 pixel strokes. 
For the lc u I&rsquo;ll probably try to find another font that has doublesided serifs on the u to find comfort in. I actually like the way it looks &amp; think it fits well with the other characters, but if it&rsquo;s just &lsquo;not done&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll probably be too insecure to leave &lsquo;em the way they are. Any other thoughts and opinions on this would be appreciated.
I&rsquo;ll do a 3-pixel ascender version of the regular in the next few days (have to do some other stuff I shifted forward to finish this first) &amp; post it here for comparison.</div>

<p>Good luck&hellip; Not even the Romain du Roi (which has
double-sided ascender serifs) has doubles on the &ldquo;u&rdquo;:

<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t work (especially
on-screen, which can be a very different animal).</p>

<p>For the dots on &ldquo;i&rdquo;/&ldquo;j&rdquo;, I think I&rsquo;d make them two pixels vertical. You might also try leaving them two-horizontal, but raising them up one pixel to the full height.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;t&rdquo; might be better short.</p>
<p>A couple of other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d give the UC &ldquo;J&rdquo; a bigger tail.</li>
