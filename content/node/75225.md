body: "I got a brief the other day that is basically aimed at promoting; saving the
  earth. My first thoughts about it was, great, this should be pretty straight forward
  to research and generate ideas from.\r\nSo, I got right onto having a little mind-mapping
  session on my, freshly bought, layout pad. It went pretty well the mind-mapping
  as I got a fairly strong idea to start off with, not that it mattered at this stage,
  since I now needed to go and do some research to fill the empty gaps of knowledge
  I was missing out on. The research proved useful, as always. I now had some more
  ideas, some good, or so I think, and some bad, pretty standard at this point. \r\nOne
  of my ideas involved using the whole 350 x 500mm page covered with pure typography
  and some sort of colour schemed imagery filling the typeface, leaving the background
  white. Only problem was what typeface to use? I narrowed it down slightly by opting
  to use a Sans-Serif because the poster is about present and future issues and by
  using Serif typeface, I think I could be misleading people unintentionally..."
