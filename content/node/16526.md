  greatly appreciated. 'The Mix' xtra bold from the Thesis family  was about as close
  as I could find for the Zacamoco logotype.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDom"

  body: How about <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/projekt/linotype-projekt-bold/testdrive.html">Linotype
    Projekt Bold</a>? I don't think it's an exact match, but it's at least pretty

  body: "Thanks,\r\n\r\nthat is very close, I've had a look at some more type in this
    font and I'm thinking they might have slightly customised a few of the characters
    or maybe it's another cut of Projekt if there is one.\r\n"
