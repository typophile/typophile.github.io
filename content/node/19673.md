  body: The forums are moderated, and specifically the Type-ID section for archival/search
    purposes. If we had everyone naming their thread 'Please ID this font' it would
    be chaos.

    service. I do however <em>not</em> edit posts*, only subject lines in order to
    make it easier for our IDers to quickly identify individual threads. Gotta keep
    this magnificent identification machine well lubricated. ;^)\r\n\r\n<em>* The
    only time we edit the actual content of posts is when they contain links to pirated
    fonts and other stuff that is prohibited on this board.</em>"
