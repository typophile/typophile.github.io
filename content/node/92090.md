body: I mean 'original type designers' as rather a loose term.  Anybody from Gutenberg
  to Garamond.  I mean "trying to accomplish" not as in making a profit, or maintaining
  legibility, but rather a more ambiguous thing such what aspects a font would have
  to have to be considered a good font in their eyes.  I am looking for the secrets,
  not that which they may have openly talked about in a public setting.  A type designer
  apprentice's notebook, apprenticing with a great master, would be perfect, if such
  a thing could be found.
