body: "Some time ago, I designed a letterhead for a local organization using CorelDRAW
  11.  The result has been used since as a .pdf file.  Now I need to edit the letterhead
  and have discovered that I no longer have Kabel Bk BT and Kabel Ult BT on my computer
  system (Mac).  It may be that the fonts resided on an earlier computer which crashed.
  \ The fonts may have originated from a set of disks that I loaned to a colleague
  (who claims he returned them), but I can no longer find them.\r\n\r\nNeedless to
  say, I assume I need to reinstate the fonts in order to edit the file (I don't suppose
  I can edit the .pdf file).  Could someone please advise me as to the simplest and
  cheapest method of achieving this?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAnthony (Ottawa)"

    two I need.

  body: "Hi Anthony,\r\n\r\nhere are two links where you can purchase the fonts:\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-kabel/book/\">Kabel Bk BT</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-kabel/ultra/\">Kabel Ult
    BT</a>. They both came with your Corel DRAW 11.\r\nF"

  body: "You can edit the PDF file in Illustrator or similar programs assuming it's
    not locked - or if it is, you have the password - but first off you'd will definitely
    need the fonts in question - and that's assuming the text wasn't converted to
    outlines at some point before making the PDF.  So, the obvious thing you're going
    to have to do s purchase those fonts again.\r\n\r\nI've looked on Linotype and
    if you just need the two weights, it's not that expensive at all.  The only other
    option if you don't want to buy the fonts is to try and find a free similar looking
    font, but off hand I can't suggest an alternative, sorry.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "Thanks everyone and particularly Florian.  I purchased the fonts and they
    worked pretty well although I had to adjust the alignment.  As Jens indicated,
    they weren't named exactly the same as the originals (ITCKabelStd-Book versus
    Kabel Bk BT etc.).  I'll try to attach the image I was working with (the resolution
    isn't quite right but you get the idea).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/title_4960.jpg]"
