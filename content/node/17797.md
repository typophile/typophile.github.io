  these letters are different to Helvetica/Helv Neue Bold, Arial Bold, and some others
  i've looked at. With most of the fonts i've checked the 'M' bugs me a bit.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FFMA.jpg]"

    Have you got any more characters?\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "thanks for the reply Tim,\r\n\r\nThe 'A' looks right but the 'M' is different.
    Must be from a similar family. This is from the FFMA site and the body type could
    be the same font.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FFMA2.jpg]"
