  account? I have a paypal account! unless it's not allowed? I didn't see anything
  that said we couldn't offer money. \r\n\r\nI changed the name of my salon after
  my business partner left. It was Nails, Etc and I changed it to Scottsdale Hair
  & Nails - because now we do hair and hair people don't want to be \"etc\".\r\nTHEN
  the city made me add Downtown to it. So it's downtown scottsdale Hair & Nails.\r\nI've
  had three logos created. One by a paid \"professional\", one by me and one by a
  sign guy. They both were totally vanilla. Plus- I have no idea what I'm doing -
  clients say \"do it yourself\" and to them I say \"get out!\" (the sign guy used
  orange on a dark window - you can only see it if you're wearing glasses and standing
  right in front of it.\r\n\r\nI spent two days trying to pick out a font and I give
  up. The best thing I came up with was using the ampersand from microgramma from
  masterfont. sad huh? See! \r\nI'm not even looking for a logo so much as a decent
  font that will be visible from more than 10 feet away. Something that doesn't look
  generic.\r\n\r\nAm I asking for too much? Tell me if I am. I even have photos of
  the salon so you can get an idea of what it's like.\r\nhttp://share.shutterfly.com/action/welcome?sid=9AZMWrZw3asWu
  \r\n(no log in necessary, just click to view)\r\n\r\nIt's modern and a little industrial-
  zen-ish. My biggest concern is not having a font that looks oriental because so
  many people associate it with discount salons. \r\n\r\nIs anyone interested? If
  not, would you refer me to someone? \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you so much.\r\nDe Anna\r\n"

    a link from imageshack but I'm having a hard time figuring it out...\r\n\r\nI
    like the look of washington square NF, however it's not ideal for window signs.
    I think I like the tall d's and l's. It reminds me a little of old hollywood."

  body: "one more comment from me...I just want to say that I read the post about
    the band logo and I was hesitant to ask. I was just frustrated with the lack of
    creativity from well, myself and the two other people I used. \r\n\r\nHaving been
    through a nightmare paying for a logo and then having my sign guy/wannabe graphic
    designer install yuck on my windows. I understand the value in having something
    that I like and that works. \r\n\r\nThe problem is- how does a person really know
    what they're getting? You can see portfolios online and see the sign/logos they've
    created but honestly - you can still be buggered! \r\n\r\nWhen I found this board
    I looked at the critiques of logos and thought  \"The people here are passionate
    about their work - they probably see print anywhere and know the font!\"  I thought
    it would be a good place to get great ideas or at least referrals for great ideas...but
    never for free.\r\n\r\nfyi- You can't believe how many times an old man has walked
    in to my salon with thick toenails the color of a schoolbus and said \"can't you
    just cut my toenails?\" and expected it for free. \r\n\r\n*shudders*"

    an idea, I'm cool either way :)"

    already another salon, then it might be good for you to focus on a different group
    of customers. Or go straight ahead to compete them, if you now you can do it better.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    it is only after you tell us what kind of customers you want and what kind of
    image you want to give them that someone can design an identity for you."

    me and I've forwarded my information to him. Medivh-I'll keep your contact info
    just in case he changes his mind. \r\n\r\nGrot Esque- other salon? It's a sea
    of salons here in Scottsdale. My salon is an existing salon. I've had it since
    1992. I'm just revamping, remodeling and rebranding. \r\n\r\n\"It\u2019s modern
    and a little industrial- zen-ish. My biggest concern is not having a font that
    looks oriental because so many people associate it with discount salons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm
    interested in conveying the same for my logo. Clean lines, relaxed atmosphere.
    I have a full clientelle so I never thought of what sort of clients to attract.
    I'm interested in attracting booth renters so my hair stations are full. Good
    question. I haven't been asked that before.\r\nProbably the reason I haven't been
    happy with a logo.\r\n\r\n"
