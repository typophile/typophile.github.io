body: "I'm doing a typography research for a magazine design project.\r\nThe magazine
  is italian and it's going to be distributed in Italy only. The core theme it's architecture.\r\nI've
  been asked to do a type research.\r\n\r\nBODY COPY SERIF\r\nI've been ask from my
  creative director to find the font you can see in the sample attached for the body
  copy.\r\nYesterday I posted the sample in the Type ID board, were the font was identyfied
  as Adobe serif.\r\nI think this font is not a good example of typogaphy, and i want
  to propose something different. i need to find something similar, well design and
  possibly new. the font has to be serif and modern with light contrast of thikness.
  \r\n\r\nBODY COPY and TITLING SANS SERIF\r\nI need to find a sans serif to combine
  with the serif. Letter forms must be \"not cold\" (not so geometric) but simple.
  Must work good with body copy and as title text (big size) as well. And it must
  have at least five style. If new better.\r\nFor this one I was thinking of:\r\n1.
  Fedra Sans\r\n2. Relay (may be to geometric)\r\n3. Amplitude (not so good in big
  size)\r\n4. Tetria\r\n5. FF meta \r\n\r\nany suggestion will help\r\nthank you in
  advance\r\ngetel\r\n\r\nsorry if my english is not correct\r\n"

  body: "I was going to suggest Fedra, but it's already on your radar!\r\n\r\nIf you're
    looking for font \"systems\", it's hard to go wrong with the work of de Groot.
    I would also recommend taking a close look at FF Legato (and possibly pairing
    it with FF Avance - but maybe not) even though I suspect it might be too organic
    for your brief.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
