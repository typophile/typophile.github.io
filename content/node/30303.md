  MS have a quite human readable order starting with all uppercase glyphs, then small

    the first 256 Id's in a TrueType font regardless of cmap - this may be related

    - or maybe it isn't.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "I cannot say anything about TrueType OTFs, but since Microsoft uses arbitrary
    glyph order, this seems to be fine.\r\n\r\nPostScript/CFF OTFs also allow arbitrary
    glyph order -- but there is a little caveat which I found:\r\nOn Mac OS9 with
    ATM, you would not access the Euro via the according key. InDesign 2 is an exception
    since it does not rely on the OS or ATM. (I decided for a nice glyph order and
    against supporting OS9.)\r\nWith apps that run in OSX or Windows there does not
    seem to be any problem.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "There are a bunch of things related to glyph ordering. Here are just the
    few that I can think of off the top of my head.\r\n\r\nOpenType CFF fonts can
    be marginally smaller if the first couple of hundred glyphs are named and ordered
    according to a standard scheme.\r\n\r\nGlyphs being ordered consistently when
    they can be substituted from one group to another allows for block shifts, which
    makes for better glyph substitution performance. So for example if your regular
    numbers are zero through nine and are consecutively ordered, you should do the
    same with numerators, inferiors, oldstyle alternates, and so on.\r\n\r\nSome older
    versions of Photoshop expected the first glyph to be the notdef (was this only
    in OpenType CFF? I forget), and if you stuck a regular glyph in that slot, it
    would not be usable.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: "There are at least two more concerns with glyph ordering in OpenType fonts:\r\n\r\n-
    for TrueType-flavored OpenType, Apple's TT spec dictates that the first two glyphs
    must be the notdef and null. It also puts some other requirements on character-to-glyph
    mapping. http://developer.apple.com/textfonts/TTRefMan/RM07/appendixB.html\r\n\r\n-
    the glyph ordering controls the order the glyphs are displayed in InDesign's glyph
    palette"

      and that was the reason why I thought of using a glyph order optimized for users
      instead of an encoding based order.\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\n> Glyphs being ordered

      it comes to block shift, are there any difference in the AFDKO feature syntax
      in using \"[a-z]\" compared to \"a b ... z\"? Or is it just a requirement that
      the glyphs in the block are in a strict order in the font?\r\n\r\n/m\xE5rten\r\n"
