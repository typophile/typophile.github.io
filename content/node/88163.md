  body: "Richard Fink, that's incorrect. The SIL OFL has the OPTION to restrict the
    use of 'upstream' names, and while it is almost always used, it is optional. In
    my personal opinion Google is likely to use that option if it asserts a trademark
    on the name. Perhaps it does, I don't know. \r\n\r\n\r\nChester, yes they can
    use Roboto as their main typeface; however, since the font is under active development,
    you'll want to make sure they stay up to date with the latest and greatest versions
    (and keep in mind that this may reflow their documents. I also note that it seems
    to me that no official release has been made, only an early copy bundled with
    a programmers toolkit for development/prototyping by programmers - and that version
    has been spread all over the place, like to FontSquirrel. "

  body: "Haha Sii :) I personally like and promote 'release early, release often';
    my work to fund ttfautohint was driven by me wanting to remove a real and practical
    hinderance to doing so, since for as long as hinting is required for web fonts
    to be broadly useful, and hinting remains an expensive and hand-made piece of
    post production, then this way of designing isn't all that practical unless you
    have deep pockets - or like to do hinting ;) However, plenty of people have been
    complaining about the first publicly available version of Roboto, and I think
    its important to be aware of this in the context of choosing it as a house style
    type.\r\n\r\n"

    If I am, or was, indeed, under the wrong impression about the Apache license.
    Or are we not talking about the Apache license?\r\nI lose track, quite frankly.\r\n\r\n>However,

    me complains? Well, certainly not about Roboto.\r\nIt's fine with me. But here,
    I've lost track again - what's hinting got to do with it?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/richard.fink\">Richard
