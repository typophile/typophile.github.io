		<div class="commentbody"><p>When I reached the ripe old age of six or seven years, one day one of my teachers made my mum come in to the school and made her watch me write out the letters of the alphabet, because they were concerned about me drawing my stems from top to bottom instead of bottom to top like all the much-alike kids, and presumably adults, did. There were a few other unusual ways I had of drawing characters which they pointed out and made my mum observe me comitting to paper with a pencil.</p>
<p>She looked at this jerk teacher and said, &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; The teacher hummed and hah-ed, but was unable to really say that what I was doing was bad. He shrugged and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just unusual that&rsquo;s all. No big deal, but we would like him to draw his letters the same way everybody else does.&rdquo; My mum laughed and told him what a ridiculous waste of everybody&rsquo;s time he had made. My method of writing letters was different but my letters did not look substantially different from accepted norms.</p>
<p>Had I been armed at the time with the kind of language skills acquired by the age of thirty-three, I would have told that teacher to &ldquo;stick your draconian pendantry up your arse for nothing and fack off while you&rsquo;re doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So instead I had to settle for staring at him as if he had green skin and antennas coming out of his head.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m used to using cursive majuscules when I write my lowercase in cursive as well, but some of them (the Z, G, F, T, Q and I in particular) are unintelligible for them.  They also teach cursive here before printing (???) and don&rsquo;t connect all the letters.</p>
<p>The only thing I remember doing was to cross my Z and 7 like my dad did &lsquo;cause he was a mathematician, whereas all my classmates continued to write them normally.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My teachers wanted me, and the other 5 wacky kids from the other public school where we started out, to follow the copperplate-based models everyone else was using, instead of the chancery-based models we used. Fortunately someone must have pointed out the meaninglessness of the distinction, and we were allowed to continue as before. Turns out the chancery hand is useful, allowing quite fast writing without much deterioration. It&rsquo;s pretty efficient.</p>
<p>I think if kids persisted in writing all caps, they would have been re-trained.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For some reason they expected our stubby tiny hands to have an easier time gripping monstrously thick crayons and pencils, at least for the first couple years. We were taught a strange hybrid cursive printing, making upright disconnected letters using cursive stroke order, and were brutally chastised for making looping ascenders. Then we were taught proper cursive with normal pencils in second grade. All this discipline was quite literally painful for me, giving me a powerful psychological aversion to handwriting to this day.</p>
<p>By fourth grade I had abandoned it all for all-caps printing when I couldn&rsquo;t get on a typewriter.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>We were taught in the 1940s using pointed steel pens which we dipped in ink bottles. The hard part was that the desks were old and badly scratched and whittled. This caused pen-points to get stuck in a crevasse and splot blobs of ink. Given that we were writing on the grand canyon, my writing was quite good early on. As time went by and I grew older and wrote faster, my penmanship degraded to its present state of illegible scrawly mess.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I cannot speak for myself, but this topic hits home because my daughter, Katrina, age 4 1/2, just started drawing her name using lowercase letters this week. When she asked me how to make an a, I showed her the two-story a, and as far as she knows, that&rsquo;s the only way to draw a lowercase a, and she does it pretty well. I haven&rsquo;t heard yet what her pre-K teacher thinks about it, but I&rsquo;m hoping she&rsquo;ll be impressed! I know I am.</p>
<p>Her t also includes the little forward hook (for lack of my knowing the technical term) on the bottom of the vertical stroke, which looks pretty great.</p>
<p>What I do remember about my early letters is that I couldn&rsquo;t wait to learn how to write in cursive. In first grade, I went to the second grade for reading class, where the cursive letters were posted above the blackboard. I took careful note of the illustrations and began proudly writing in cursive in first grade. I guess that was my intro to italics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I reached the ripe old age of six or seven years, one day one of my teachers made my mum come in to the school and made her watch me write out the letters of the alphabet, because they were concerned about me drawing my stems from top to bottom instead of bottom to top like all the much-alike kids, and presumably adults, did.

<p>You were the deviant by drawing the stems top-to-bottom?
In your region they teach to write the stems bottom-to-top?</p>
<p>Also, the double/single storey &ldquo;a&rdquo; is not a real question around here, as most of Europe (at least German speaking countries and Eastern Europe) they teach to write running hands rather than &ldquo;printed&rdquo; style, separate letters; in running hand only single-storey version works.</p>
<p>I remember we were only thaught to read &ldquo;printed&rdquo; style letter, and learnt parallelly writing (and reading) running hand.</p>
<p>My brother (who went to his first years in school in a different country than I did) learnt in the first year to write &ldquo;printed style&rdquo; letters along with reading them in the first year, just to learn to write running hand in the second year (and after that running hand was demanded).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in high school and I&rsquo;ve been writing in capitals since 6th grade. The only time I use miniscule letters (in cursive) is when I have timed writing exams since it take less time to write. Ive had many teachers who loved the fact my printing is fairly neat and easy to read, but others (especially in middle school) that did not like it very much at all.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/keys2_3640.gif]</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting really, i write many of my letters much differently that most people. I actually started drawing my Qs with that sort of hook after I saw GE Inspira.</p>
<p>PS I realize the spelling and writing on this paper is pretty disasterous. I was pretty distracted by my friends the day we had this assignment.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that S is often ligated in your print-writing. Caps slow you down because of their structure and disconnected strokes. People avoid script writing because it&rsquo;s so easy for it to disintegrate, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to. You have the discipline to learn a good hand and stick with it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Reading this I remembered a little scam I had in grade four. I (it seemed to me  now) often had to stay late after school to write lines. &ldquo;I will study my spelling before tests.&rdquo; was one popular phrase I&rsquo;d have to write out a hundred, or even two hundred times after school.</p>
<p>I hit on the idea of holding two pencils so that I could write two lines at at time. I had to be careful to hold each pencil slightly differently and alter my hand position from one line to the next so that the lines weren&rsquo;t too similar and keep the pressure even so they weren&rsquo;t too different..</p>
<p>Three pencils were just too awkward.</p>

<p>Is it just me, or does the rule about not setting things in all caps NOT apply to handwriting? It seems to me that I can read something written in all caps just fine. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s screaming all the time like in text. Also, there&rsquo;s greater variation of &ldquo;bouma&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Look at alexhb&rsquo;s example above, and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. It&rsquo;s not hard to read at all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dan,
What &ldquo;rule&rdquo; about not setting things in all caps do you mean? I guess you mean the generally accepted notion that all caps typography is less readable than lower case.</p>
<p>That one applies more to type than handwriting. The flipside (and here we go again with topic drift into a discussion of readability) is the matter of familiarity. Despite Hrant&rsquo;s non-acceptance of the idea, I can&rsquo;t find fault with Zuzana Licko&rsquo;s maxim, &ldquo;We read most what we read best&rdquo;, because it&rsquo;s basically true. I have met people who insist that lower case type is harder for them to read than all caps. It turns out these individuals read very little book typography and write in &ldquo;printed capitals&rdquo;, and these handwritten caps are the principal form of lettering they read. By near-complete lack of exposure to what we know as typography (book settings using lower case with caps for capitalised words), these people read best the form of lettering thay are most familiar with. It makes sense. I think Hrant&rsquo;s rejection of Zuzana&rsquo;s maxim has more to do with his unfortunate experience with one of Emigre&rsquo;s fonts than his capacity for rationale and readability theory.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, lower case forms are inherently more legible and inherently more readable on both a technical and aesthetic basis. This much we know. So what an individual finds more legible or readable is a matter of personal experience.</p>
<p>In the example above there&rsquo;s a lot of rounded corners, gently curved straights, and variation of alignment, and I&rsquo;m sure those factors help make it more readable than type capitals with their profusion of straight lines.</p>
<p>I devised a test one time where I took a seriffed roman font I was working on and ran a grunge filter on it&mdash;a combination of randomize nodes and envelope. That grunged all the letters up nicely, thinning them in spots, thickening in other spots, warping of straight lines, size variation, off-zenith alignment, and characters moved off the baseline. The auto-grunged font was easier to read than the straight one I had arrived at purely by design.</p>
<p>Did Hrant or someone else at some point offer up a theory as to how randomness, noise and distortion (in the right amounts) enhances the readability of a font?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James,
Here is Quote from Kevin Larson’s paper,  &ldquo;The Science of Word Recognition, or how I learned to stop worrying and love the bouma&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weakest evidence in support of word shape is that lowercase text is read faster than uppercase text. This is entirely a practice effect. Most readers spend the bulk of their time reading lowercase text and are therefore more proficient at it. When readers are forced to read large quantities of uppercase text, their reading speed will eventually increase to the rate of lowercase text. Even text oriented as if you were seeing it in a mirror will quickly increase in reading speed with practice (Kolers &amp; Perkins, 1975).&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s pretty evident, that &ldquo;readability&rdquo; depends on training and that some might read allcaps better than lowercase (supposing they read little modern printed matter, and by some chance read a lot of uppercase text).</p>
<p>lowercase and uppercase are just two sets of forms for the same idea (which incidentally have common roots). Similar to different styles:</p>
<p>We have late medieval, early modern accounts of Dutch and German readers not coping with Antiqua. Probably one could find newer ones from the 19th century as well.
On the contrary, nowadays most untrained readers of today have serious problems with Fraktur.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a question of practice.</p>
<p>Actually, what I discovered after developing a secret alphabet as a child was, that not only was it possible, that someone is more proficient in reading than writing (this is evident. So many people read, but can barely write, or if so, unrecognizibly), but you can also be more proficient in writing than reading! I mostly took some notes in my secret alphabet when I was scribbling something (in boredom) and others should not be able to read it, so I rarely read it. Even though I made up the alphabet myself, I could fluently write it, but only decipher it sign-by-sign!</p>
<p>It was quite a relevation on how the human mind works!</p>
<p>Actually, we know, that medieval copyists worked the following way: one read (aloud), many wrote (that was time-saving&hellip; multi-tasking/parallel processing, if you will). I would not be surprised, if the latter were less fluent in reading (of course depending on how much they read in the time not spent with writing).</p>
