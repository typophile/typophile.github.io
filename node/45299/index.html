  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This was a question a couple of weeks ago. It was interesting enough for me to go and try to program it! My first attempts were pixel based, but this one is a full-fledged Windows application which outputs a printed image &ndash; I recommend printing to a PDF, so you can test various settings at your leisure.</p>
<p>It looks like this (slightly bigger than here):
<img src="/images/old-images/textimage_prg_5709.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>and can be downloaded for your pleasure at [[http://www.jongware.com/binaries/textimage1beta.zip|my own little space of the web]] (thass a direct download link). It works allright under XP, don&rsquo;t have a Vista nearby so I can&rsquo;t try that out&hellip;</p>
<p>First, a tip: don&rsquo;t <em>stress test</em> it! It&rsquo;s a quicky, written in something like 5 or 6 hours, and any weird input will surely crash it&hellip; The &ldquo;preview&rdquo; is more of a gimmick, it doesn&rsquo;t really tries the transform. Perhaps later&hellip;</p>
<p>It only accepts BMP files (but since it only works under Windows anyway, I don&rsquo;t see reasons for complaints &ndash; also, loading any graphic file is <em>hard</em>!). On the plus side, you can directly drag your BMPs on it, and type or paste text directly into the RTF box. Any formatting will be lost in the output, though.</p>
<p>If you need access to a Page Setup box, hold the Shift key while pressing Print (I ran out of screen estate).</p>
<p>A tiny teaser: Che looks like this.
<img src="/images/old-images/TextImage_4265.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As you see, it works best with &ldquo;iconic&rdquo; images that are still recognizable in this coarse resolution. That&rsquo;s where the icon and sample came from; old Al is pretty iconic by now.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>Thanks for the offer! But I&rsquo;m not quite there yet :-)
Yesterday, I added a single line (okay, maybe 2) and the justification was spot on (now it isn&rsquo;t) AND it&rsquo;s +/- 20% faster &hellip; So, still tinkering. I&rsquo;m considering changing the justify routine altogether, as it&rsquo;s now held together by spit and tape.</p>
<p>This version doesn&rsquo;t use FreeType at all, so a straightforward port to Mac could be a major pain, because the initial measurements are done with pure Windows calls. On the other hand, after that it&rsquo;s number crunching time, so &hellip; perhaps &hellip;</p>
<p>But, as I said, it&rsquo;s not quite fully developed. I still have some novel ideas &ndash; I wonder how good it can get.</p>

<p>It may or may not be an issue that your measurements, etc. are done purely with Windows calls for the font metrics and such&hellip;I could use the corresponding Mac OS system routines, or use FreeType, or if necessary read the font files directly.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The reason my first tries were with FreeType is because I&rsquo;m not that comfortable with win coding :-) and I&rsquo;m still developing <em>some</em> FreeType skills. It was pretty easy to write a proof of concept, though.
Then I realized I couldn&rsquo;t create a <em>vector</em> image that way &ndash; only pixel based, and that was a real drag.</p>
<p>So I switched to pure Windows, using its native print routines. It turned out to have its own weird stuff. D&rsquo;ya know that if you select a printer, you&rsquo;re stuck with its resolution, in integers only? So using floating point coordinates is off &hellip; Also, it&rsquo;s <em>impossible</em> to scale a font to non-integer sizes! And I&rsquo;m having a hard time getting relevant font data from this cursed system :-) So much for Myriad Pro Semibold at 8.5 pts; Windows doesn&rsquo;t allow either! At best, it explains some of Word&rsquo;s intricacies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Bad &amp; Ugly news. Good news is that the hard work can be done (I think) in your programming language of choice &ndash; given that you have (a) an image to sample, (b) an array of fonts and sizes (with access to their metrics on a character basis), (c) a large chunk of filler text, and (d) the dimensions and a pointer to some &lsquo;canvas&rsquo; to write the results to. My version is in plain C, but the logic in the hard work loop should be portable enough. Originally, I was considering a PostScript version &ndash; now <em>that</em> would be something! (drool) (okay, not now)</p>
<p>Your website doesn&rsquo;t mention contact details, but you can reach me through my domain, using my first name as e-mail address. Intentionally oblique, to fool spambots &hellip; (God, how I hate spam! Don&rsquo;t get me started on that.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>An excellent observation!
No, I don&rsquo;t do that. That means that the &ldquo;distance&rdquo; in gray between, say, 4 pt Arial and 5 pt Arial and 6 pt Arial is the same for each. As characters are square objects, this should be a logarithmic difference instead (?? &ndash; pretty sure about that&hellip;).</p>
<p>You can influence this by eyeballing it with the Curves option, but I think I know how to make it more &ldquo;exact&rdquo; (read: &ldquo;less inexact&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s not the bounding box, because this has the same black-to-white ration for each of the different sizes :-) Instead, I should check against the coverage of each size against the <em>total line height</em> of the line &ndash; that is, the height of the biggest font size. So a 4 pt Arial Black is much lighter than a 12 pt Univers Light, on a line heigth of 12 pts.</p>
<p>The <em>actual</em> gray values are not that important, though. What&rsquo;s more important is the different <em>ratio</em> from one level to another, those you can now set manually. That should/could be an automatic setting.</p>

I thought you were using the same font in ultra-light, light, medium, black, ultrablack or something like that. Sorry for the misunderstanding.</p>

<p>I just finished adding a few interface niceties: a <strong>Save</strong> and a <strong>Load</strong> button, so you can save (and load) the font list. You can also manage the list itself, moving stuff up and down and editing with a quick double-flick on the font name. You can save the settings as &ldquo;defaults.fis&rdquo;, which will set the defaults (&hellip;).</p>
<p>This version has a different <em>name</em>: somewhat more appropriate, <strong>FontImage</strong>. I noticed &ldquo;TextImage&rdquo; was already used for ASCII art apps, this is definitely something else :-) (Thanks to Tim Satink for that name.)</p>
<p>The new version, again available  [[http://www.jongware.com/binaries/fontimage.1.1.zip|at my site]] (direct link), features a slightly faster printing and better justification. Some bugs included &ndash; still no guarantees.</p>
