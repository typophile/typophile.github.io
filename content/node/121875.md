  i and a friend just finished designing a typo on illustrator, and we are looking
  to export it as otf and ttf, i copied/pasted all my vectors, and when i try to generate
  the font it displays an open contours warning, our typography is based on a complex
  grid with lots of crossing vectors, there is always a circle in front of or in the
  letter.\r\nWhen it exports, a weird F symbol appears on nearly every letter.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance,\r\n\r\nArthur"

  body: Being new to a site does not necessarily mean you can post anything, anywhere
    you want. You should at least have read the various descriptions on the home page;
    then, you would have seen the best place to ask technical support is in the <a

    of FontLab, which is why you are getting the "weird F symbol on nearly every letter."'

  body: "In addition to the \"F\" problem...\r\n\r\nIllustrator allows line segments
    and stray points to be scattered around, which works fine for most things that
    most people use Illustrator to do. Making a font, however, means adhering to a
    few more exacting expectations, like clean, closed contours that define filled
    shapes. FontLab has a few features that help facilitate clean-up chores under
    the Contour menu heading. If all your glyphs are riddled with these sorts of issues,
    though, you might have a job ahead of you that will require a large degree of
    manual fixing."

    typeface. "A typography" is not a meaningful term in English.)'
