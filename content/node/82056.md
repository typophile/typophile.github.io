body: "This is similar to Ad Lib, but the Es are upside-down, and there are other
  differences. This is from an old laundromat sign, possibly from the 60s. There is
  a possible mention of this font on Ask Metafilter, referring to a font used  in
  the credits of the old Batman TV show, but the image is no longer there, so I don't
  know for sure if this is the same font they refer to there.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font-sample_3672.jpg]"

    yet.
