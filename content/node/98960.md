body: "This is from a 2008 political science book published in Germany. It is pretty
  decently designed, compared to most other publications in its academic field, the
  typographic standard of which is pretty low these days IMHO (in Germany, that is).\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://i.imgur.com/F7999.png\"/>\r\n\r\n(sorry, no better qualitiy available)\r\n\r\nThe
  typeface used looks one of those Caslon revivals, c. 1900; Binny/Bruce/Monotype
  \xBBOld Style\xAB, etc.: the T, E, the g, the Q, the numerals... but which one is
  it? [[http://www.identifont.com/list?2+monotype%20old%20style+0+4J5+1+S1+1+NGT+3|Monotype
  Old Style]] is close, but it's not quite it. I've had a look at several \xBBproper\xAB
  Caslons, but none of them had that Q. What's weird about this book, by the way,
  is that there's <em>no italics</em> it.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance!"

  body: "no doubt about it -- thanks, Jan!\r\n...that would explain why there's no
    italics in that book. And apparently the budget didn't allow for a proficient
    typographer and/or proofreader either ;)\r\n\r\n{x}"
