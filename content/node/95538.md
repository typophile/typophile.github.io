  of nation-states. Plenty of other imagined communities lurk beneath the surface
  of the standard political map. Check out the continent's alcohol belts [1], have
  a look at its core and periphery [2], or inspect the languages in which Europeans
  tweet [3].\r\n\r\n\"What you'd probably not consider, is to study a map of the different
  alphabets in official use across Europe today.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://bigthink.com/strange-maps/577-broken-letters-a-typogeography-of-europe?page=2"
