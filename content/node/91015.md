  below. I've been testing a range of different fonts and styles (one attached) but
  can't seem to find the vibrant feeling I'm looking for. I want it to reflect ideas,
  action and creation and still work nicely together with the logo. Anyway, I would
  be happy if you would like to share your creative input on this.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think a route could be to align the suffix with p\u2019s descender, and
    tuck it under the i. In doing so, you will balance the gap.\r\nAs for style, trying
    to mimic the logo too much in weight and shapes will risk to damage its impact.
    I rather would try something contrasting, but subservient, like an handwritten-style
    script."

  body: Thank you for your ideas. I agree with not mimicing the logo and I've made
    some test with serifs and handwritten fonts and it looks good but the fonts I've
    tried doesn't really reflect "ideas, action & creation" so I'm curious to hear
    suggestions from the creative people here at Typophile
