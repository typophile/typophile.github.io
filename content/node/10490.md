  <BR> <BR>This is the headline typeface used in the St. Louis Globe Democrat newspaper
  dated June 22, 1971. It kinda jumped out at me when I was looking through my grandma&#39;s
  old photos and stuff, and I haven&#39;t been able to figure it out. <BR> <BR>Your
  help is appreciated.

  body: By far the most common Newspaper sans of the pre-digital era was Spartan.
    What you have here is an exceptionally poor cut of it, with the two-storey &#39;a&#39;
    standing out as particularly badly done &#40;I&#39;m not sure which alternates
    were available, but Jaspert has just the one-storey&#41;. It will be hard to track
    down exactly which manufacturer was responsible for this butchery, but perhaps
    your curiosity doesn&#39;t extend quite that far.

  body: 'Maybe I need to see some pre-digital samples of Spartan, because I&#39;m
    having trouble seeing it. But then again, I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m
    talking about/looking at most of the time. <BR> <BR>Spartan&#39;s a Futura knockoff,
    but this looks like a much more faithful knockoff, and maybe someone got bored
    and decided to mess with it a little more? I don&#39;t know if things like that
    happen much. <BR> <BR>That two-story &#39;a&#39; is what caught my eye especially.
    Otherwise I probably would have just assumed it was Futura. Is your &#34;particularly
    bad&#34; subjective or is there some specific crappiness I&#39;m not noticing?
    <BR> <BR>The &#39;g&#39; I notice though. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got some more samples,

  body: Journal Sans is a lot closer I think. I&#39;m not really looking for the typeface
    for any specific use... just curiosity and wanting to learn more about this stuff
    in general.

  body: 'From Myfonts.com&#39;s Journal sans page: <BR> <BR>&#34;The typeface was
    designed at the Polygraphmash type design bureau in 1940-56 &#40;project headed
    by Anatoly Shchukin&#41; based on Erbar-Grotesk typeface of Ludwig &amp; Mayer
    company, 1929 by Jakob Erbar, and on Metro typeface of Mergenthaler Linotype,
    1929 by William A. Dwiggins. A sans serif of geometric style. For use for text
    and display typography.&#34; <BR> <BR>Now the question is; does anyone here have
    links to any specimens on Erbar-Grotesk &#40;1929&#41; ? <BR>Dwiggins&#39; Metro
    #2 is familiar, but how does the #1 look like?'

    of the Tempo family in digital form that I know of are <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/tempo/"

    rest of the family has never made it to digital &#40;although there was a guy
    in the UK a couple of years ago who apparently got the rights to the Ludlow name
    and library who had a few new weights of Tempo for sale, but he and the site seem
    to have disappeared&#41;. I don&#39;t recall that it was ever even available in
    phototype.

  body: 'A bit more about Tempo: <BR> <BR>It was very popular headline face for newspapers
    before &#34;cold type&#34; took over in the 1970s. As Raph points out, it looks
    similar to Spartan. Both were modeled on Futura--Spartan to a greater degree and
    Tempo to a lesser degree.  <BR> <BR>Tempo, like some other contemporary geometric
    sans, had alternate characters so you could make it look like Kabel, Erbar, Vogue,
    or Futura &#40;with a one-storey a&#41;. The reason for this was undoubtably pragmatic.
    Most of their customers &#40;newspapers&#41; used other manufacturers&#39; equipment
    &#40;Linotype mainly&#41; for setting text. Ludlow was used for headlines. By
    offering these alternate characters, they could offer reasonably close matches
    to the smaller faces set with the other equipment. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70511.gif"
    alt="tempo1"> <BR> <BR>The Light Italic and Medium Italic were very unusual in
    that they had tails on some of the lowercase characters &#40;m, n, i, u&#41; and
    other somewhat calligraphic features--even a set of swash caps. The closest I&#39;ve
    seen to this is <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&amp;id=18&amp;subpage=viewfontspecimens"
    target="_blank">Neutraface Italic</a>. Tempo Italic was definitely in the back
    of my mind when I dreamed up <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/coquette.html"

  body: Red Rooster &#40;Steve Jackaman&#41; had rights to at least some of the Ludlow
    collection. The font Jan pointed out was one of the digitizations Steve did on
    typefaces from the Ludlow type, and there were a number of others, including Radiant,
    Bodoni Campanile, Ultra Modern, Railroad Gothic, Florentine Cursive, Coronet,
    Ludlow Garamond &#40;including swash italics&#41; and Hauser Script. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the background  and samples on Tempo, Mark.

    Museum &#40;basically a building full of neat would-be garbage&#41;. The walls
    near all the elevators are covered with old printing plates and empty type cases.
    And I snapped this picture: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70563.jpg"
    alt="tempobolditalic"> <BR> <BR>So I guess that explains why I thought Tempo.
    <BR> <BR>And perhaps there&#39;s a chance they snatched this up from the Globe-Democrat,

    Futura, their brains expect a single storey a. It&#39;s just kind of jarring to
    read. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: Spartan had an alternate two-storey a as well, at least in the lighter weights.
    I don&#39;t know if it was used much, but in the old Linotype specimen books it
    looks surprisingly natural. I actually prefer it. It&#39;s a bit better-thought-out
    than the one in Tempo--not so wide.
