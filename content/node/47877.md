body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask about grids with magazine layouts. The reason
  being I have just been asked to quote on a job to do a layout for magazine that
  will need a 2 and 3 column template as well as a spread.\r\n\r\nI have been reading
  books by Timothy Samara (Making and breaking the grid) and Kristin Cullen (Layout
  workbook) though what I am looking for is more of an explanation on what grid to
  use and to understand better why grids may contain up too 8 - 12 columns though
  the layout will then group (3 - 5) columns and use as one column.\r\n\r\nexample
  here: \r\n[[http://www.puidokas.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/subtraction-grid.jpg]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere
  must be some rules to setting up grids or is it a visual thing?\r\n "

  body: I also was curious to how the book "Grid Systems in Graphic Design" rates
    against "Making and Breaking the Grid" for learning and better understanding the
    art of grids?

  body: I would like to know what you guys think of those books too. The Muller Brockman
    one is a lot more expensive and a lot older I know. Is there any others that are
    good?

    \r\nbut magazine, I am curious to how many columns to use, there always seem to
    be a lot more column use for magazine layout."

  body: "Monsta - in response to your question, from the little formal theory and
    historic examples I know of grids, I think it is a visual thing. By developing
    a rock-solid grid for your magazine this will give it a visual hierarchy and consistency
    throughout.\r\nIn your posted example they use many columns so they can alter
    the layout depending on what the content is. In the context of a magazine or similar
    publication you ideally would establish a width for your minimum text column and
    adding in gutters and margins, work that into a full two-page spread. In certain
    layouts you may then decide to run text over 2 columns for a feature or more for
    heads etc.\r\n\r\nHaving a template like this will give you the freedom to chop
    and change your layouts to suit the amount of copy, open pages, ads, etc.\r\n\r\nHope
    that makes sense."

  body: "when a grid system has 8-12 columns it is giving the designer a more versatile
    way of laying out the design. It is also usually used when you have more complex
    information that needs more areas to lay it out. \r\n\r\nThe reason that many
    columns are sometimes grouped into less is to give the designer flexibility. You
    are still conforming to the grid, but it give you the ability to layout a lot
    of information and many different ways you can layout a single page. The lower
    the number of columns in your design the least number of ways you can arrange
    the information.\r\n\r\nthere really are not any rules, just depends on the amount
    of information and the type of information that you have.  \r\n\r\nUsually in
    a magazine there are many different grids layouts, usually about 3 or 4. main
    articles, secondary articles and maybe the reoccurring features (i.e editors note,
    etc)\r\n\r\nhope this helps\r\n\r\ndavid"

  body: Thanks jayyy and david, what you have both written has been of great help
    and insight. What i get out of this is the versatility a grid offers with more
    columns used and also gives a structural hierarchy and constant format throughout.

  body: "What jayyy and dzobel said.\r\n\r\nThe grid, and the number of columns, should
    be dictated by the content of your publication. For example, you wouldn't usually
    split fiction into six columns, just as you wouldn't usually use one column for
    the section with letters from your readers... But then again, there are always
    exceptions.\r\n\r\nIn short, form should follow function. :-)"

  body: Find out how they are going to want to hack up the add space, for example,
    what is the smallest add they will sell. You might assume they will need a bit
    more flex than even they first imagine. If you design that in from the start they
    will love you for it later.

  body: "Having spent years in the magazine business in a former life, I would recommend
    an odd number grid approach. 13 columns is quite a flexible grid. you can have
    three columns of four with an extra column for white space that can be inserted
    either on the outside, inside or between the columns. You can have 4 columns of
    three with that extra space, Two columns of six, again with that extra space to
    use as a layout element.  Willi Kuntz was a big advocate of the 13 column grid,
    as is Will Hopkins of Hopkins/Baumann who worked with Kuntz. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey, \r\n\r\nIn my first semester of design, in our typography class we had
    an exercise learning about grids where we actually took existing articles from
    magazines and placed tracing paper over them mapping out their grids. So we looked
    at the gaps between the columns etc. \r\n\r\nI am currently doing a magazine design
    and have been doing that with some different magazines to help work out the similarities
    and differences. It might be a useful exercise?\r\n\r\nLauren"

  body: "I would emphasize what the Jameses said (jupiter & terminal). With magazines,
    typically the advertising grid is determined first. Your editorial grid should
    in some way reflect (or harmonize with) the ad grid. \r\n\r\nI also like using
    grids with odd numbered columns. I've used both, but to my mind odd-numbered column
    grids are a little easier to use and aesthetically a little more pleasing to the
    eye. Hey, but that's just me.\r\n\r\nI also like using a 13-column grid. But you
    should experiment.\r\n\r\nA grid is a helpful tool. Especially in magazines.\r\n\r\n"
