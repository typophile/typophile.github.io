  body: "renohersan, this part of Typophile is for general discussion only. In the
    future, your Type ID requests should be posted here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/typeid\r\n\r\nThe
    typeface could be Odette, by Canada Type:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/odette/\r\n\r\nOr
    Society Page, by Nick Curtis:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/society-page-nf/\r\n\r\nBoth
    appear to be based on Announcement Roman by Morris Fuller Benton, designed for
    American Type Founders in 1917.\r\n"
