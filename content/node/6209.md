  some whacky 3D typestuff. Some time ago i got myself a dual processor G4 running
  on Mac OS 9.1 and now i can&#39;t load any looks, textures, lights etc. anymore.
  It&#39;s not the system because the software is running just fine with OS 9.1 on
  my old PowerPC. Anyone know how to fix this problem? Pixar unfortunately does not
  offer any kind of support for Typestry anymore. '

    computer, it may not include all the stuff &#40;Real Technical, huh?&#41; that
    it needs, like Pixar Stuff, in the System folder. I use Typestry on an Imac w/9.1.
    no problemol <BR> <BR>Rodi '

  body: ' duuuuh, it&#39;s sometimes the simple things that solve a complicated problem,
    i guess. i thought i did copy everything, but after your post, Rodi, i thought
    i should maybe do it again ... and now it works perfect again! thanks for ...
    whatever. <BR> <BR>for all of you reading this thread, interested in pixar typestry,
    i&#39;ll post a mail i got from pixar&#39;s customer support: <BR> <BR>&#62; No,
    Pixar never did sell the rights to Typestry to anyone. <BR>&#62; It was simply
    discontined, and suppport stopped one year <BR>&#62; later. <BR>&#62;  <BR>&#62;
    I will agree with you that it was a fabulous product, but <BR>&#62; Pixar restructured
    at that time, and moved out of PC and Mac <BR>&#62; products to concentrate on
    movies, and high end rendering  <BR>&#62; software. <BR>&#62;  <BR>&#62; We&#39;re
    glad that you enjoyed the product.  Most reviews, and <BR>&#62; responses from
    customers was overwhelmingly positive. <BR>&#62;  <BR>&#62;  <BR>&#62; Thanks,
    <BR>&#62; Pixar Customer Support '

    <BR> <BR>they have the Looks CD, which contains about 2/3-3/4 of the original
    Pixar Looks CD and shaders. They also sell Mac RenderMan with Pixar Show Place.
    You Might want to check them out. <BR> <BR>Merry Christmas, <BR> <BR>Rodi '
