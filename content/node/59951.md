  i place a vector into an InDesign document, can i scale it (up and down) within
  InDesign, or do I have to scale the native file several times over until it's approximately
  right (which, is what I've always done...).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, can I scale a placed
  Photoshop object down, without losing quality? I'm sure it doesn't scale up correctly.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Generally, InDesign is pretty good at scaling things (dunno about really
    complex Photoshop objects, though).\r\nBy the way, which version are we talking
    about?\r\nA bit of advice, for optimal results: \r\n* first enable High Quality
    Display\r\n* then select the object inside the frame and scale at will\r\n* last,
    choose \"Fit Frame to Content\"\r\n\r\nHappy scaling! :-)"

  body: 'I''ve never had a problem scaling vectors, but scaling rasters is only a
    temporary solution if you''re going to press. When you have your design finished
    you (or your prepress) is going to have to rescale the psds or whatever and replace
    them at 100%. '

  body: "Certainly you can scale any image placed in InDesign, the difference from
    Quark, which might be causing the confusion, is that you can change the scale
    of the frame and the scale of the image separately. You can also select and (shift)
    drag to scale. \r\n\r\nI have never encountered a problem with scaled raster or
    vector files, although I do make sure I do not go below effective ppi of 250 (in
    the info window) in the case of raster.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Yes, you can scale anything up and down in InDesign. Other option is go to
    Ojbect/ Transform to scale % of the size that you want, or scale by x and y. \r\n\r\nFor
    Scaling Photoshop file; If you working on couple hundred page documents in InDesign,
    I would suggest you export that photoshop file as tiff, or jpeg, either 150dpi
    or 300dpi (depends on what you need), and scale that image in photoshop to the
    size that you need because it would help your program (InDesign) performance work
    better, otherwise it would be very slow to take time load a huge photoshop file
    while you only display it in 1 inch box.\r\n\r\nIn Photoshop, when you scale down
    or up by using transform, you losing quality because you squeeze the image smaller
    or expand it bigger. So, don't do that, go to Image/ Image Size, change the document
    size or Resolution. It'll help you maintain the original file better. If you worry
    about the resolution/ quality of the file, save it as .tiff, which is lossless
    quality file, with jpeg you losing quality every time you save it. You can also
    find this info on Wikipedia or other sources.\r\n\r\n;)"

    And the nature of the beast being just that \u2014 a sharpened image will loose
    its edge if it\u2019s overscaled in a layout program. One should try to stay in
    the 85\u2014115% range, or redoing the original image is necessary.\r\n(Thank
