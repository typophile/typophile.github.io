body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am working for a company that is currently using Hedustry as
  a corporate font for all its online and print communication.\r\nWe are planning
  on developping a condensed version of the Heldustry. But first I would like to know
  how I have to proceed.\r\nThe company already have several licences to use the Heldustry
  font.\r\nI wonder if I am allowed to design for them the condensed version of Heldustry.
  I check the agreements of the font but there is nothing about that kind of case
  in it. The condensed version is aimed to be used as a corporate font by this company
  and only by this company.\r\nThere is no intention of selling the condensed font
  to third parts.\r\nSo the question is I am allowed to design the condensed version
  of the type without any copyright infringements ?\r\n"

    contain despotic clauses best ignored.\r\n\r\nMy own view is generally that if
    a modified font will not leave the hard\r\ndrive(s) of a party that has properly
    paid for the original, it's all good.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    why do you need to adapt Heldustry?\r\nHeldustry is \"square Helvetica\", and
    Helvetica Condensed is square, why not use it?\r\n\r\nIf you consider the Light/Regular
    Helvetica Condensed to be too rounded, then use Akzidenz Grotesk Condensed."

  body: "This is corporate ego. The company is huge and THEY have Heldustry for several
    years as a corporate font. The design agency that sold them the ID explained that
    Heldustry had something special compared to Helvetica\u2026 Now they believe it
    and would like to have the condensed version. And as money can buy anything here
    I am ready to make the condensed version. I tried to explain that Helvetica would
    be a good alternative as a condensed version but they prefer Heldustry. Now, I
    will not complain, as for once, a client believe in type design as a corporate
    tool :)\r\n\r\nI contacted Monotype but am not sure they are the one who own the
    copyrights. Fontshop says it is a creative alliance font > Monotype. But no answer
    until now."

    The dumb thing is that there are tons of people out there that modify accents
    on font (for example) and don't even care that it is not allowed. I guess I want
    to do it just right and be troubles free but this is a PITA to follow the right
    way !!! Sometimes I wonder if it worth it to even ask !"
