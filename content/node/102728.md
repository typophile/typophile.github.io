  screen \u2013 unfortunately it only comes in high resolution (not Retina) and there
  was no way to scale up the UI elements without compromise of quality... I exchanged
  it for normal glossy screen.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for solutions to decrease glare
  and have read some reviews of various options; however I'm concerned about the loss
  of quality (blurriness, prismatic effect) with respect to doing type design. \r\n\r\nWhat
  are your experiences? Does a anti-glare film decrease the quality enough introduce
  problems \u2013 i.e. for proofing text and so on.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    a trade off. The best you can do is minimize the glare by controlling the lighting
    in your environment and the screen\u2019s position in relation to the lighting."

    The resolution makes UI elements smaller but for me it hasn't been a problem,
    but I suppose that can vary depending on the application you're using. But most
    folks these days seem to want a glossy screen as it has deeper blacks and other
    advantages. \r\n\r\nAs Mark says, controlling lighting and position can help.
    Also I've seen some folks buy (or make) a black screen hood to block overhead
    lights and side lights. "

  body: "A laptop often gets used in environments with lighting outside your control,
    so to me a glossy screen is bad news. I have no personal long-term experience
    with anti-glare add-ons - that could be a good solution. The 17.3\" Dell Precision
    I've been looking at getting has a 1920\xD71080 matte display, and it's great.\r\n\r\nMost
    people want a glossy screen for the same reason they want a 16:9 aspect-ratio:
    they watch movies. Type design is sort of diametrically opposed to watching movies.
