  Not being a digital face, I drew some letterforms, and posted them there in June.\r\n\r\nNow
  I've come back to this. Here is a sample of some more of the letters; a PDF is also
  available below. (see also http://www.typeoff.de/?p=125)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typeoff.de/?p=125\">[img:sites/default/files/old-images/v-test-web-001-big_6652.gif]</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Very promising! \r\n\r\nJust looking at the upper case now, I notice that
    the curve at the bottom of the B has a smaller radius than the others in the B.
    It might look better matching. Does the E need to be a hair narrower? The crossbar
    on the F slightly shorter? The bottom serifs on the C, J look a bit fat; they
    might be better matching the weight of the ELZ bottom spikes. Is the J a little
    too wide? \r\n\r\nThis is well on its way to being a very nice and useful display
    face."

  body: "This is a very interesting hybrid design - I'm seeing Didone, Eastern Europe,
    the RdR (love the nick on the \"el\") and Fenice. The \"a\" is a brave attempt,
    but the beak and the tail are fighting; that would give it a cool PoMo flavor,
    but no other glyph has such an attribute... I'd look at ITC Veljovic* and Sylfaen**
    for ideas on the \"a\". Or maybe remove the beak entirely - yeah, I think that
    would pump up the elegance even more; although I might still make the tail a wedge.\r\n\r\n*

    Here are the changes inside:\r\n\r\n1. There are now two different a glyphs. The

    an alternate d for better comparison.\r\n\r\n2. Narrower J\r\n\r\n3. Lowercase
    s added\r\n\r\n4. The C has been lighted up a little bit (comparison \u2013 CJE)\r\n\r\n5.
    F \u2013 slightly shorter crossbar, which I have also moved down a notch\r\n\r\n6.

  body: "a/d: I'd go for the slightly upslanted tail (the second one). But if you
    go for the totally flat one on the \"d\", make the one on the \"a\" identical,
    not a wedge. And I assume the \"u\" will follow suit.\r\n\r\ns: I'm in love.\r\n\r\nE/F:
    Are you going for an apparent alignment of the bars? If so, the one on the \"F\"
    looks slightly lower. Personally I might \"break\" it and make the bar of the
    \"F\" noticeably lower (and probably a bit [more] shorter too).\r\n\r\nFlourished
    K/R: not working for me (especially the \"K\"). The \"J\" and single-flourish
    \"N\" seem passable, but only the double-flourish \"N\" is really singing I think.
    On the \"K\" and \"R\" maybe try loosening things up.\r\n\r\n2/3: charming. A
    bit too much tail on the \"2\" though.\r\n\r\ny: seems to be working, but let's
    see it in \"wyvern\".\r\n\r\nk: the narrow one seems better.\r\n\r\nQ: start the
    tail from the inside; maybe try splicing in one of those long serifs, like from
    the \"J\".\r\n\r\nJust noticed something bad in the \"r\": don't thicken the arch
    at the beak - make it like the \"a\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the oval period.\r\n\r\nBTW
    the texture is very nice - just make the blank space smaller.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "notes on the lower case:\r\n\r\nI think the bottom of the d looks best with
    the flat serif as it matchs the top of the ascender. And then the tail of the
    a would best match the d, as Hrant wrote. \r\n\r\nTo me the spur on the l is needlessly
    distracting. I think it might hurt the reception of an otherwise useful display
    face. \r\n\r\nThe r isn't working. Normally the join with the stem is lower on
    the r than the m and n, and the same weight at the junction. Here the high and
    heavy join is disharmonious. I don't know about the beak on the r, but I think
    the connection needs to be fixed first.\r\n\r\nThe g is going to be a challenge--maybe
    a one story will be the way out."

  body: "The spike on the \"el\" is a mark of royalty (it was partly a -failed- copy
    protection scheme restricted to fonts produced under Louis XIV). Admittedly such
    historical sensitivity is essentially moot, and a good functional reason to have
    the spike (to disambiguate with the UC \"I\" in designs with double-serif tops
    on the ascenders, as in the RdR) is absent here*. But the spike is still: elegant;
    distinctive; and a great talking point, as Spiekermann has observed concerning
    the \"g\" in Meta. This sort of thing is pure gold in a display face - and it's
    not like we have a shortage of conventional Didones out there...\r\n\r\n* Although
    that didn't stop the Imprimerie Nationale from putting it in anyway:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CharlesX_3978.gif]\r\n\r\nBTW,
    concerning the \"el\" spike I saw something pretty shocking recently: it was actually
    present in some <cite>manuscript</cite> documents, from way before the RdR, possibly
    even before the invention of printing (in Europe). I have no idea why.\r\n\r\nI
    do have an idea about the \"y\" though: try a form that's a \"v\" with a descender
    going straight down (and curling) - like a \"j\". They used to do that back when,
    and not only does it looks classy and rarified but it helps spacing too.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"g\": especially if you keep the \"u\"-based \"y\" it might be smart to have
    a monocular form, but not making a binocular \"g\" also seems like a lost opportunity,
    even a cop-out. I would look to the funky \"g\"s in the old Didot fonts, like
    the ones JFP has revived.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    just love the l-spike. I know that it isn't necessarily appropriate, but this
    is a remix of styles anyway, and maybe it'll be able to add something. In the
    font's newest version, I have two l-glyphs\u2026 a \"normal\" l and the spike
    l.\r\n\r\nThis version has a draft at a complete lowercase. There are currently
    two g glyph test: a single and double-storey g.\r\n\r\nHrant, my first go at a
    lowercase y was a v with a tail, just like you recommend. It didn't work. But
    I will try again anyway.\r\n\r\nThe period is now round.\r\n\r\nBill: there the
    lowercase r is new in this version.\r\n\r\nLari: <em>I don\u2019t like the lowered
    diaresis.</em>\r\nDon't worry. It will just be an alternate in the end. Otherwise,
    it wouldn't match all the other diacritics. But old German metal type almost always
    had cap umlauts differently than the dieresis is now positioned. This alternate
    lowered version will have uses."

  body: 'Nice improvements, like in the r. (Could it be just a bit narrower?) I do
    think your single story g works better with this design. To me the only thing
    that doesn''t work is the y. With the j and the g the same, particularly, it doesn''t
    look ''y'' enough. Does a diagonal version with a horizontal serif at the bottom
    not work? I don''t have any bright ideas if that doesn''t work, but to me its
    the only bit that doesn''t work. Everything else works, though I think further
    tweaking can make it smoother.  '

  body: "The binocular \"g\" is completely out of character; it's from a different
    century and a different continent. But I still think you can make a fitting one.
    The monocular \"g\" is balanced and stylistically harmonious, but it's a missed
    opportunity. One place to start looking for a good binocular \"g\" is the \"a\";
    another is the \"s\".\r\n\r\nSeeing the conventional \"el\", I can think of another
    reason to keep the spiked one: the \"el\" is the poorest letter of the Latin alphabet,
    needing by far the most help in contributing something useful and memorable to
    text.\r\n\r\nI agree with William that the \"r\" should be narrower.\r\n\r\nMore
    on lc:\r\n- I'd make the eye of the \"e\" smaller.\r\n- The \"f\" is not very
    attractive, but maybe a good form in context.\r\n- Why not make the left foot
    serif of the \"k\" double-sided?\r\n- In the \"k\", the join is looking neither
    here not there: there's too much going on for this type of design. I might make
    the top arm continue to the stem, and have the leg come out of it, or come out
    of the join, one or the other, clearly.\r\n- The bar of the \"t\" could be shorter
    on the right.\r\n- In the \"x\", the thin arms are flared differently to distraction.\r\n-
    There seem to be some funny decisions about foot serif lengths: a longer right
    side makes sense in the \"f\" and \"r\", but it clearly doesn't in the \"el\",
    and in this design probably not the \"p\" and [left side of] the \"q\" either.
    In this last pair if you do keep one side longer, I'd make the left head serif
    of the \"d\" longer as well.\r\n\r\nMore on UC:\r\n- The vertical stem in the
    \"G\" should be taller, possibly even reaching the bars of the \"E\"/\"F\".\r\n-
    The \"T\" should be wider.\r\n- In terms of cap widths, there's something unsettling
    about the decisions of what to make narrow and what to make wide; I can't entirely
    put my finger on it, but for example looking at the sequence \"HAMB\" I'm seeing
    a lot of confusion.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
