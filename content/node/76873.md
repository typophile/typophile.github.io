body: "I don't know what it is about alphabetical strings that InD hates. I have tried
  formatting the text with hyphenation, without, with every language, no language.
  What always happens is, I copy the entire character set from the fontLab \"Quick
  Test as Opentype\" menu selection and paste it into an Ind blank page.  It is fine
  if you keep the type small but, gosh darn'it, sometimes we pesky old type designers
  want to see the type at 36 or 48, or, God Forbid! even 60 points and just let it
  float along breaking somewhere near the right margin without everything but the
  first line jumping in to that godforsaken place the red box in the bottom corner
  puts it! I just want it to wrap merrily along and, call me crazy, even be able to
  change fonts with the same text and not have it jump into \"the red zone is for
  loading and unloading of glyphs only!\" land. \r\nHopefully there is some simple
  command that is somewhere buried in InD to just turn its brain off and just flow
  the damn letters and get the hell out of the way!\r\n\r\nI am not afraid to try
  this at home without a professional driver and a closed course.\r\n\r\nSorry for
  the rant,\r\n\r\nIf anybody knows the \"Shoot the Paperclip guy\" command for IND
  on a Mac I would be graciously thankful.\r\n\r\nChris\r\n\r\nHere is a sample at
  17pt which just gets to the end of the line so all is well:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/17ptFine_6326.png]\r\n\r\nHere
  is a sample at 18pt, one size larger, notice all type has vanished, the red box
  is there even though there is an entire page full of space left, and the red dot
  tells me I have an overset problem:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/18ptTooBig_5794.png]"

  body: Maybe you could somehow insert spaces between every glyph, and then set the
    width of the space as close to zero as possible. That way, there would be a natural
    break between every glyph, and it would never try to hyphenate. (I haven't tried
    this myself, just an idea.)

  body: "The problem is that I don't think it should be such a pain tricking InD in
    to getting out of the way.  It is not like this is one and done.  I have to do
    it each time.  I also don't want to change any spacing or kerning.  The point
    of a specimen is that it looks just like the type without any manipulation.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for trying Mark. Don't mind me today, I have been grumpy ever since I started
    my Nutritionists \"Healthy Diet\" ;-)"

    p128 and up. Indesign is not happy about this. \r\n\r\nMark\u2019s idea about
    spaces is intriguing. I bet that we could just use sed to insert an en space between
    every character. If we give the en space a width of 1 and just don\u2019t include
    it in the final font this should work well."

    text for a single run of letters, after which the breaks get spotty.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/return_6600.png]"

  body: "Actually, what I was thinking is that you can create a paragraph style in
    InDesign where, in the Justification settings, the minimum and desired wordspacing
    is \"0%\". I tried it and it works. The spaces collapse to zero, but still work
    as line-break opportunities. No need to create a temporary zero-space (or near-zero-space)
    character in the font.\r\n\r\nThe only trick is to insert a space between every
    glyph."

  body: "Dezcom, although this is not exactly what you want, here is the solution
    I use (sorry for the screens in Portuguese):\r\n\r\n<strong>1</strong>. With your
    text already set, do a GREP replace operation using the settings bellow. This
    will insert a hair space between each one of your characters.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capture_12022010_010609_6201.gif]\r\n.\r\n<strong>2</strong>.
    To avoid additional spacing, you can set a GREP style to be applied for every
    hair space. In this case, I just created a character style (\"Space\") and set
    it with a \u201325 tracking.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capture_12022010_010639_4542_6386.gif]\r\n.\r\nI
    used a hair space instead of a regular one in order to apply negative tracking
    just for these situations. So the GREP style will preserve other spaces you use.\r\n.\r\nThese
    two steps can be automated. You can save the GREP replace command and reapply
    it to any text, while the styles with GREP can be imported from one ID publication
    to another."
