  alot, but haven't learnt how to make a font funtional. Are there any online type
  design courses? Not on using type in design, but actually designing type.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    IDC and JJ are the best in Mumbai with many experts in typography and type design.
    The professors might not have time, but they conduct workshops. Better still is
    get in touch with senior students of typography \u2014 PhD students are the best,
    they have sound theoretical knowledge and have lots of time to share and teach,
    you'll find their contact info online. I think it'll be difficult to learn Type
    design online. It needs face to face critiques.\r\n\r\n"

    'type design books' and see what's available.\r\n\r\nHere is one possible link:\r\nhttp://www.design-bookshelf.com/Type/index.html\r\n\r\nStep
    2: buy yourself a copy of FontLab:\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/\r\n\r\nYou can probably
    get a student discount.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Jump right in and give it a try.\r\n\r\nThere
    are plenty of individuals that did just that.\r\n\r\nGood typography, or I should
    say, making good fonts that you can sell, comes from a lot of practice and experience.\r\n\r\nBut,
    if you truly have a passion, you'll find a way to overcome the setbacks. Good
    luck.\r\n\r\nOther online resources:\r\nhttp://www.magmabooks.com/content/bookshop/cats.asp?sc=0&p=1&c=TYP\r\nhttp://particletree.com/notebook/typography-crash-course-roundup/\r\nhttp://www.sessions.edu/courses/Course-Advanced-Typography.asp\r\nhttp://www.angelynngrant.com/mas.html\r\n"

  body: "Second that, especially the passion part. I'm (aspiring to be) one of those
    self-taught guys. We may not have the time to accumulate the immense printing
    history knowledge that some around here definitely have, but it should be enough
    for \"making a font functional.\"\r\n\r\nDon't forget to mention <a href=\"fontforge.sourceforge.net\">FontForge</a>
    as a free FontLab substitute. And yes, there are many websites out there like
    <a href=\"http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics\">Typeworkshop</a>
    and <a href=\"http://briem.net/2/2.3.1a/2.3.1.01.notes.htm\">Briem's Notes on
    type design</a>. The best resource and link collection though remains this forum.\r\n\r\nMost
    importantly though, look at both the typefaces you like and the ones you dislike
    <em>very closely</em>."
