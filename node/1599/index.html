We&#39;re probably the most traffic she&#39;s gotten this past year. <BR> <BR>Also, I did not say there was anything wrong with you; please reread my original statement before taking things to the level of ad hominem. <BR> <BR>Now that being said, I could see it if she had tens or hundreds of fonts and was advertising &#34;FREE FONTS HERE&#34;, but she wasn&#39;t.  To threaten to call Monotype on her for two files is not doing her a favour.  Threats for anything are obscene, especially if you come out with one your first time up to bat. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I disagree with your final analysis, Chris. I think the full potential ramifications of distributing fonts illegally should be plainly stated up front. This is not a threat, it is a warning of legal culpability, and it should be delivered &#39;your first time up to bat&#39;. Stringing someone along in a protracted negotiation about their offering of someone else&#39;s property without warning them in no uncertain terms of the consequences of their actions is not doing them any favours. While you&#39;re faffing around trying to be nice, someone else might have already alerted Monotype, without benefit of a warning.</div>

Ultimately, it wasn&#39;t even an issue, as the band had already parted ways, but the whole thing could have been resolved nicely had the guy just said, &#34;You know, I have a band with the same name. Are you guys still together? Because we are, and we want to use the name we&#39;ve recorded under since 19XX.&#34; He presumed that there would be a fight, rather than presuming that they could talk like adults and come to an understanding. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m interested to see if she&#39;ll respond, and if so, how she&#39;ll respond.</div>

The Manhattan cycling scene is huge. My club Century Road Club Association is the largest club in the country and the oldest. Most of the riding here is on a Rte 9W that goes north to Canada.
