  body: "It is not ITC Galliard.\r\n\r\nI have ITC Galliard, as part of the Adobe
    OpenType Collection. I collect fonts. I am not a designer. I simply like looking
    at them and using them for work and pleasure.\r\n\r\nAs to the picture in your
    post: the bar on the lowercase \"e\" in ITC Galliard is straight, and not slanted
    as in the picture your provided.\r\n\r\nFurther, the ascender on the capital \"J\"
    is too short, that is, the tip at the bottom isn't elongated enough. In ITC Galliard,
    it slants noticeably to the left, even beyond the \"roof\" of the \"J.\" I don't
    see that in your picture. Nor is the \"roof\" of the \"J\" in your pic as pronounced
    as it should be. It might be a case of your pic being slightly blurred, but I
    stand by what I see.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm not using a designer's eye. I simply compared
    what I have at various magnifications to what you provided."

  body: Thanks, guys, I appreciate your input. Though I have to say that I did know
    that it is not ITC Galliard, but was wondering if it might be adifferent version.
    The e and J were my points too. So you think it is ITC Giovanni? I wil check it
    no. Thanks a lot again!!!
