  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">this is a face i&#39;ve been developing based on a couple of directions in type i&#39;m interested in personally. one being stencilled lettering ala the punk or d.i.y. music scene, and the second being the more structured, grid based forms we&#39;ve all been seeing a lot of lately. the first one is based on  a 14 x 8 grid, and the condensed just rotates the grid 90 degrees. each letter- and number-form fills the space, but i don&#39;t intend it to be a true monospace, due to bad optical spacing issues i&#39;m getting. i&#39;m not totally sure i like it, which is why i&#39;m posting. be harsh. is this something derivitave or that someone would actually buy/use? also looking for input on the forms themselves. thanks! <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1404.gif" ALT="syndicate.gif"></div>

		<div class="commentbody"> i agree. the &#34;s&#34; was actually developed as a logo, and the face was built around that concept. those forms definitely are more dense than the others--H, L, T, and U are the most open feeling-- but there&#39;s just not much to work with on those letters. i&#39;ve found that the condensed is easier to actually set type with, but the extended has a more unique feel. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow. This has got to be one of the best dystopian typefaces I have ever seen! <BR> <BR>Your subtle blend of stencil, blackletter and grid-based type is just excellent, and the condensed version, which imho is the best, even reads quite well. I can easily picture this successfully used in a cyberpunk scifi-flick on oppressive propaganda posters. &#40;Too bad you didn&#39;t finish it before they made Blade Runner... ;D&#41; The slanted line-ends are my favourite, as they subtly echo blackletter type and the &#40;undeserved&#41; associations that it has gained with Nazism, thus strengthening the totalitarian feel of the face. &#40;They also remind somewhat of <A HREF="http://www.typeco.com/3Gothic.html" TARGET="_blank"> Gothic Gothic</A>, another great face.&#41; I hope I didn&#39;t read to much into your face... ;D <BR> <BR>Furthermore, making the normal and condensed verions related, but not by squishing or extending, is a stroke of genious. &#40;But skip the italics.&#41; However, the normal version seems a bit too heavy to my eye. I would look into either sacrificing the grid, or making it one &#34;pixel&#34; narrower. But then again, this might destroy the feel of the face. You could try it anyway. <BR> <BR>Also, shouldn&#39;t the stencil gap of your normal &#39;G&#39; be positioned like that on your normal &#39;C&#39;? And shouldn&#39;t the tail of the normal &#39;Q&#39; extend outside of the letter, just like that on the condesed &#39;Q&#39;? Possibly, you could also slant the line-end of the roof on the &#39;1&#39;. <BR> <BR> <BR>Btw, the name makes me associate to the computer game classic Syndicate, which indeed is very dark and dystopian. Is this intentional? Do you even know of the game?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> For me, I continue to love the &#34;solid&#34; characters --  the S, the G and the E, for instance. &#40;The non-condensed versions&#41;. The problem I have is that those characters don&#39;t sync up with the &#34;non-solid&#34; characters as well -- Q, U, and so on. On the other hand, there are some characters that are flat-out impossible to make fit into that paradigm, like the T and I -- no matter how you make them, they will never be as black as the S and G. <BR> <BR>So I&#39;d have to say things are going great -- I love the typeface. However, the condensed still doesn&#39;t turn my crank. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Tyler - well you know already how I feel about this face!&#42; So maybe some Typophiles can help answer some questions that really haven&#39;t been answered here. <BR> <BR>Specifically, if a face like this goes to retail, approximately HOW MANY copies &#40;licenses&#41; will be sold? <BR> <BR>There are plenty of lurkers who could give us some idea of retail sales. Someone said 50 might be an average of sales within the first year. <BR> <BR>For example, Gothic Gothic by IHOF. Is that selling 50 copies, 100 copies, or more? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve read about percentages offered by various foundries, but I&#39;ve never heard anyone mention how many of a particular font is sold. <BR> <BR>If anyone wants to contact Tyler or myself directly, we will respect your privacy and not share the information if that&#39;s what you request. <BR> <BR>thanks, <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>&#42; I contacted Tyler the day he posted this about possibly including Syndicate in Apollo 26&#39;s first retail release. </div>
