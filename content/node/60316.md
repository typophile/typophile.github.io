  [[http://typophile.com/node/59857|here]]), I have begun to develop a single-case
  font. Where uppercase and lowercase conventional forms of a given letter differ,
  I've tried to make hybrid letters that borrow from both forms. \r\n\r\nThe results
  are far from graceful, but interesting and more readable than I expected. Does this
  have any potential?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ambicasespecimen4february_4017.png]"

    a little misplaced/light compared to the other letters. Maybe you could\u2019ve
    dared a little more in borrowing from the \u201Ca\u201D letterform.\r\n2) The
    \u201CD\u201D stand out, both because of the taller ascender and because of the
    prevalent lowercase letterform. Maybe you could try to make it more like a mirrored
    \u201C6\u201D (borrowing from uncials)."

  body: "Thanks Riccardo!\r\n\r\n'A' and 'D' have been through many iterations - both
    started close to your ideas, but I couldn't get them to work. \r\n\r\n'A' began
    with the stroke coming down from the 'a' top around like the top of the bowl of
    an 'a', but then dropping down to make the left leg of 'A'. The problem was that
    if this was a thick stroke (my first impulse) the letter as a whole got too dark.
    And if I made that stroke a thin, the windiness of it looked weak. I even tried
    thick down to the crossbar and thin below that, but that was hideous. \r\n\r\nD
    has been problematic from the get-go, because of the differences in the forms
    of uppercase and lowercase. My first idea was the uncial-like d, but I found that
    the thinning top was unconvincing as a D-like shape. The resulting form didn't
    fit the style of the other letters, and also threatened to read as an 'a'. Here
    are some more recent attempts:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_6497.gif]\r\n\r\nAny
    of those preferable to the one in the first post?\r\n\r\nI also have some ideas
    for revisiting 'M', and I'm toying with giving 't' an ascender."

    the way you've shrunked the capital portion of G to make room for the descender...did
    you try a two storey descender there? Y and T are interesting. \r\n\r\nI think
    A looks a bit narrow, or the crossbar could be lower? Could Y be flipped vertically
    and the stress changed to make the A?\r\n\r\nE isn't quite working for me, the
    top seems to need more squareness, perhaps. \r\n\r\nRhe bowl of R is a funny shape...what
    about if there was a lc arm with ball terminal used to form the bowl of an uppercase
    R, then the leg connecting only to the stem? (not sure my description works so

    W (and why not X too) could have ball terminals perhaps on the right side? Or
    would one curved bowl suit W? To me these letters look a bit too capsy, though
    I do like the serif treatment you've come up with. \r\nCould U do with a foot?
    Y may need a bit of tweaking...the uneven slopes of its arms look slightly unresolved
    but it's definitely heading in a promising direction.\r\n\r\nWould you consider
    a zero with a dot inside? 6 and 9: ball or fish-hook terminals? "

    I'm suggesting this, but I wonder if all the sharp corners (on the serifs specifically)
    should be rounded the tiniest bit. You have the interesting organic shapes happening
    within a lot of the letters but then you end the shapes with a sharp serif. I
    realize at small sizes, text sizes, it won't really matter, but I wonder if the
    tiniest rounding or champfering might remove the rigidity. (This is my perception.)\r\n\r\nAbout

    of the curve [of R] is, but I think it should be down a bit more.\" Do you mean
    where the extrema are, or something different by \"center of the curve\"? (Do
    you want the whole pseudo-bowl lowered, or just the thin not to arc as much towards
    the northeast?)\r\n\"About the Y with the tail. The curve, I think, needs to be
    exaggerated slightly more or removed altogether.\" Do you mean a sharper curve
    (or an angle) cutting further into the black near the join?? (And which #version
    of Y are we looking at?)\r\n\"And I think the left curved apex on the M could
    be smoother (rounder?)\" Maybe on the underside? (This is tricky because the hump
    has to turn and head down pretty quickly in order to maintain a rough symmetry
    and approximate the massing of a cap M.)\r\n\r\nHere are four H's with increasing

    the stem.\r\n\r\nOkay, here's a new M and N. More similar to what I had before

    this as a double s. (But it is a cool glyph! Perhaps the second s and the right
    part of the joining stroke needs to be softer.) The first half is based on the
    long s in all typefaces I've ever seen, even in upper case versions. I think the
    obvious solution for a double s is to make the long s descending.

    advice on the swashes.)\r\n\r\nA: The outer bowl curve now ends in a short straight
    line at the bottom. Could it perhaps continue its arch upwards instead? That would
    also take some strain off the whole curve. \r\n\r\nLeft side of foot serif is
    now softened where it meets the stem, right side is not.\r\n\r\nB: I still think
    it's a little tight at the bottom. Pulling the part of the stem under the bowl
    join a few units to the left would open it up.\r\n\r\nC: Just right.\r\n\r\nD:
    Slight bumpiness too the inside of the swashy curve, but that might not matter.\r\n\r\nE:
    A little abrupt transition from stem to curve on the outer side? \r\n\r\nAlso,
    is the difference between top left serif height and \"roof thickness\" of D and
    E (and bottom of L) a little too great?\r\n\r\nF: Absolutely brilliant.\r\n\r\nG:
    Ditto.\r\n\r\nH: Perhaps the crossbar bend should be a little smoother.\r\n\r\nIJK:
    Great.\r\n\r\nL: Se note concerning D and E. \r\n\r\nLslash: To thin and boring
    slash.\r\n\r\nM: Top of thin vertical a little bumpy on the inside.\r\n\r\nN:
    Brilliant, but perhaps too alone? Could that top left notch be repeated at the
    bottom of B and U and the top of P, perhaps?\r\n\r\nO: Booooring! ;-)\r\n\r\nOE:
    Too black at the top, I think.\r\n\r\nP: Se N note.\r\n\r\nQRS: All beauties.

    good.\r\n\r\nT: Slightly stiff bend on the hook?\r\n\r\nU: See N note.\r\n\r\nVWXYZ:
    Just right. Have you considered slanting both of Z's serifs?\r\n\r\nGreat pilcrow
    and section mark! Lovely!\r\n\r\nCopyright, Trademark, number sign and Registered
    look a little light.\r\n\r\nCent bar looks unconvincing.\r\n\r\nI think 4 is too
    black. \r\n\r\nSwashes are all great, perhaps except initial S, its curves looks
    a little awkward. I'm mightily impressed, I couldn't draw a swash to save my life,
    I think. (I've never tried.)\r\n\r\nAll in all, wonderful work! Keep it up! I

    what's swash becomes blurred. Maybe.\r\n\r\nThe way the top-left swash on your

    that more maybe?\r\n(Same applies in milder forms to \"V\" and \"X\".)\r\n\r\nI
    agree the one on the \"G\" doesn't flow (I see you have the same squiggle on the
    \"Y\", \"W\", \"V\", and \"Q\" too). I think generally it might be too small/thin,

    changes are encoded in the swsh feature: if a designer wanted just the initial

    the glyphs manually. \r\nI asked a related question in the [[http://typophile.com/node/60990|Build

    In fact I'm finding it very hard to spot anything to crit! So my observations
    are about the non-swash shapes.\r\n\r\nWith your Eth, I think I find the uppercase
    section of it too small. Is it the same scale as the G? \r\n\r\nThere's something
    catching my eye about the spine of S. The curves seem to not quite be unified

    really liking some of the glyphs. ADEKNQ and Y are fantastic. B and R are not
    quite working for me. The top counter of B is such a strange shape it makes me
    worry about legibility. With R, the teardrop terminal gives the overall shape
    quite a high optical centre and I'd like to see what happens if that is brought
    down a bit.\r\n\r\nDid you try a teardrop terminal on the top of Z?\r\n\r\nYour

    bulb went off and I realized that not only this piece, but almost every other
    part of the font that didn''t look quite right to my eye has the identical problem:
    a stroke that modulates like a broad-nib rather than split-nib pen (i.e. that
    uses translation rather than expansion). Moreover, some of the things I was most
    excited about (like that reversed Y tail) take a more daring approach to more
    sudden expansion of stroke. So I''ve been rethinking a bunch of glyphs, most especially
    those with prominent horizontals (TLZ257). Feels like a real breakthrough. I''ll
    post an update some time soon.'

    swash, it will recognize when a letter appears at the beginning, middle, or end
    of a word. By that I mean I've had to program it that way, with a byzantine (and
    probably laughably inefficient) set of rules I made up myself. Here's a thread
    I started which helped along the way:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/60990\r\nSo
    it starts with one lookup that says ignore these rules for anything with a letter
    preceding this one (to separate out the initial positions), then if it's an X
    before an ascender, use the special X.init, else if it's a K or R before a descender,
    use the special K.init or R.init, else replace the letter with its .init version.
    (Yes, you can use opentype classes and would really need to to stay sane.)\r\nThen
    it has a lookup that says ignore these rules for anything with a letter following
    this one (to separate out the final positions), then if it's an X after a descender,
    use the special X.fina, else replace the letter with its .fina version.\r\nThen
    it has a lookup that says ignore this rule if the letter is K, Q, or R followed
    by a descender (to prohibit tail crashes), then change out the letters that have
    .medi forms to those.\r\nThen it has still more complicated coding for the X.medi
    (since that has to take into account both the letter before and the letter after)."

    see this in the bottom of the closing parenthesis.)\r\n\r\n- Something funny going
    on with the second \"D\" on p. 8 (I see an overscore?)\r\n\r\n\u2026and those
    Drop Cap examples are gorgeous. Great usage idea; and that initial \"T\" really
    is one of the nicest glyphs I've seen lately.\r\n\r\n(Before you make this the
    official specimen, be sure to fix the \"RHTHYM\" on p. 2!)"

    So I've cut the descending A.medi I had added, as well as U.medi and T.medi (though
    it may be my favorite glyph I've drawn for this. My consolation is that shape
    will live on within the T.init and T.fina forms I'm keeping.) \r\n\r\nWhat do

  body: 'I''m not sure, but I wanted to say I really enjoy the multiple personalities
    of this typeface. The unswashed version is so strange and stern, and the swashes
    really take it to some different, much more playful place. In the image above,
    line #1 and say line #5 feel almost like different fonts. That''s a good thing
    in terms of the ton of options you offer users; but makes it more work to produce
    (I don''t even want to imagine the number of glyphs) as well as trickier to *use*,
    too. An easier option might be to make a swash version (perhaps in this case only
    with the swashed medial "E", not the standard "E") and a standard version and
    sell them as 2 fonts? Obviously less versatile though, but simpler and perhaps
    clearer. Just a thought.'

    be an out-of-the-box setting for someone who just wanted a little swashiness,

    under the impression that it is (or should be) possible to get different degrees
    of swashiness, maybe via different features or something. Which, I would wonder
    how many users would actually fiddle around with it in that amount of detail.
    But yeah, it's quite possible that I got something wrong, and/or that I'm not
    making sense. :) Mostly thinking out loud.
