		<div class="commentbody">Hi Mario,

I just run your student's creations through a database of around 200.000 fonts,
and the results are:

<strong>any.jpg:</strong> nothing close

<strong>marisu.jpg:</strong> 
Looks a bit similar to <strong>[[http://www.dafont.com/arista-2-0.font?text=Piclot|Arista 2.0 Alternate full]]</strong>
but I think it's more "similar in concept" than a copy

<strong>OSCAR2.jpg:</strong> nothing close

<strong>crimi.jpg:</strong> nothing close

<strong>sheila.jpg:</strong>
Sorry to reveal, but this is a cheat:
It matches exactly <strong>[[http://www.dafont.com/mias-scribblings.font?text=PQRST|Mia's Scribblings]]</strong>

...therefore, I have to say you must be proud -in overall- for your students,
because if they cheated, they did it in a smart way by choosing uncommon fonts
which are difficult to spot :) 

Cheers

1) I feel lucky making fonts.
2) How can you be sure?

Doesn't a good teacher help a student discover his
potential, and not necessarily financially speaking?

although they take some areas of graphic design, it's very superficial
They are NOT gonna be graphic designers (that's another career) and certainly NOR typographers

And yes, we, as good teachers help to discover their potential, that's what we do every day,
pointing out their strengths, and trying to improve their weaknesses

PS I said "lucky them" NOT because I consider it to be a demeaning job, or unimportant... 
but they don't have the ability to design fonts, no one would hire them.

I'm glad you feel lucky making fonts, make my job as graphic designer much easier

Be careful, if the CIA finds out that you can predict people's future...

> pointing out their strengths, and trying to improve their weaknesses

Which might include telling some of them to quit advertising,
and for a small minority telling them to look at type design,
at least for part-time income + satisfaction.

		<div class="commentbody">Im in advertising, but I teach typography to design students in my spare time. So I guess it is a good compromise. 

Advertising and typography, unfortunately, have very little to do with each other these days. The focus seems to have moved from crafted, thought through pieces of communication to cookie cutter ideas that come a dime a dozen. 

Either way. Typography is a skill and an art form. The people that create these beautifully crafted shapes should be respected more in the creative industry.

I love that!!!!

However I think he's exaggerating...
Science involves thinking, experimentation, hypothesis testing, etc..
perhaps he was trying to say that a real typographer needs more than just manual skill,
almost anyone can make letters, but requires much more to make a typography.

Internet is full of "hand made fonts" but nothing such as good as "Helvetica" for example
but of course those "hand made fonts" are not "perfect typography" 

I'm sure you're gonna like this.
Try these links, it shows how great Helvetica is, and how much it changes a simple sign on the streets by using it

		<div class="commentbody">Helvetica has lost its soul, and is poorly spaced.
Only the very lightest weights are worth anything,
and only when set extremely large.

Type design is a lot less Art than artists want to believe.
Just because one can't make enough money painting doesn't
mean one can really grasp and leverage what Design implies.
