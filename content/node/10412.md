  body: How did it go? I wanted to attend. The price was right but a previous engagement
    prevented me from doing so.

  body: I've been meaning to write up my (pretty extensive) notes from the presentation
    for <a href="http://typomancy.org/">Typomancy</a>, but like most of my writing
    projects, it's gotten stalled on the completion of some real-life projects. In
    brief, it was a lot of fun, Hrant spoke well and was an engaging speaker, and
    the questions were indeed the best part! It's interesting seeing graphic design
    students wrap their heads around the special challenges posed by typeface design.
    I was left with the strong regret that Art Center is too far away for me to take
    Hrant's class.
