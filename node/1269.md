  body: '&#62;relativism is a way of thinking with doubt  <BR> <BR>I agree, but I
    think there are much better ways to acknowledge our fallibility and the uncertainty
    of all our beliefs.  <BR> <BR>Popper, with whom I studied, forged a third path
    between the Positivists - who wanted certainty or a surrogate for it - and relativists
    who wanted to do away with truth as a regulative idea. His idea was that we strive
    through collective effort and looking at evidence to improve our grasp of reality,
    though it is never sure.  <BR> <BR>The problem with the relativist way of saying
    that truth is relative and there is no reality is that it destroys rational argument.  <BR>
    <BR>In my view it is quite wrong to think that relativism supports tolerance and
    open-mindedness. In fact, tolerance of the relativist only goes so far as he or
    she interacts with you. It allows for no rational discussion between people who
    disagree, for their two viewpoints are equally valid, and there is no reality,
    or evidence of reality to shed light on which is best. Argument is killed.  <BR>
    <BR>Heidigger and his followers don&#39;t debate issues, they just pontificate.  <BR>
    <BR>Relativism is in fact profoundly illiberal. My mentioning Sartre and Heidigger&#39;s
    tolerance of totalitarean regimes was actually on point. They are greatly admired
    by contemporary relativists, and they illustrate that anything can be justified
    by relativism. Relativism seems to be humble, but in fact is a supremely arrogant
    philosophy. <BR> <BR>For a start, when you deny reality, you can deny the reality
    of the suffering of others.  <BR> <BR>Popper in fact saw the upholding of standards
    of rationality as key to the advancement of knowledge and to regimes that were
    open to listening to the people and bettering their lot. And he argued so in his
    famous book &#39;The Open Society and its Enemies&#39;, specifically against the
    Nazi and Communist tyranies he had seen arise during his lifetime. <BR> <BR>A
    year ago I attended the Centennial celebration of Popper&#39;s birth in Vienna,
    and was touched by people from all over the world for whom his ideas had been
    a beacon of humaneness and liberalism under oppressive regimes. <BR> <BR>&#62;it
    appears to me a little pretentious to say : i have the truth, it&#39;s this, or
    that.  <BR> <BR>I agree completely that to claim you are certain that you know
    the truth is pretentious and even ridiculous. And I never said or believed such
    a thing. But it is equally ridiculous to deny that there are such things as truths
    and reality.  <BR> <BR>And no, the first tests of reality - as I have said earlier
    and no one have given any counter argument - are not linguistic. A child learns
    the reality of objects &#40;which yes are partly an hypothesis - a true hypothesis&#41;
    before language. Animals also learn about reality of objects, other animals, food
    and sex without ever speaking.  <BR> <BR>Relativism is just an excuse to dismiss
    those you don&#39;t agree with, rather that having to look at facts, and search
    for the truth. It is the death of reason, and as Hogarth said, &#34;The death
    of reason gives birth to monsters.&#34; <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>Guillaume, I&#39;m not sure that we mean the same thing by relativism.
    You seem to be saying that we live with doubt about many things, and need to discuss
    and debate these things and try to come up with reasonable and generally agreeable
    ways of behaving based on whatever much or little we can determine. I have no
    argument with that, and I don&#39;t think that constitutes relativism.

    dogmatism, and that is why he mistakes me for a dogmatist.   <BR> <BR>Guillaume,
    the word &#39;paradigm&#39; in the sense you are using it was introduced by Thomas
    Kuhn, partly in criticism of Popper. Popper&#39;s reply is in his essay &#39;The
    Myth of the Framework.&#39;  <BR> <BR>According to Popper, your key mistake is
    to think that agreement on a rock being solid is unimportant. It is precisely
    such mundane agreed-upon statements are the basis for testing theories in science
    and indeed in politics. Particularly in science we move closer to the truth about
    reality through such a testing process. <BR> <BR>So far, our understanding of
    social process is much weaker, but even in politics basic truths are important.
    For example, the economic &#40;as well as moral&#41; failure of centrally planned
    Leninist states eventually has led to abandonment of this economic model. Acknowledgement
    of the failure is from observing such mundane facts as the wealth in the Leninist
    states vs the mixed economies of the West and East Asia.  <BR> <BR>The mundane
    facts matter because they help guide us to greater truths, if we are looking for
    them. Abandon the idea of truth and reality, and you abandon the search, and the
    fruitful collaborative debate.  <BR> <BR>    '

    if i have one. <BR>About your politic example, with the wealth of URSS you missed
    a marxist &#34;paradigm&#34; here. For the Marx ideas to work, after what he said,
    the revolution need to take place in a wealth country. That wasn&#39;t really
    the case of the Russia, if i&#39;m not wrong; Marx spoke, too, of an industrialised

    <BR>The problem of your idea of &#34;testing&#34; is that things are more complicated.

  body: Guillaume, you can&#39;t use logic without the concept of truth. When you
    throw out truth, then contradictions are permitted. And it is a basic principle
    of logic at anything follows from a contradiction. All fruitful debate goes out
    the window. The beautiful Socratic tradition is killed.   <BR> <BR>Testing doesn&#39;t
    tell you which theories are true, but it is a very good indication of which theories
    are false. It is up to us to invent better theories that are consistent with all
    the evidence, and then test them further. <BR> <BR>In politics, the acknowledgement
    of the suffering caused or not caused by policies are very important mundane truths.
    Refusing to be guided by them as a reality is &#34;dangerous. Very dangerous.&#34;  <BR>
    <BR>I have continued to comment in this thread because I dislike seeing what I
    view as a poison in intellectual life going unchallenged. <BR> <BR>I wanted to
    make clear that there is a well-developed alternative to the fashionable relativism,
    and to inform people that there is third side to the story - you don&#39;t have
    to be either a relativist or dogmatist. And that relativism may not be a benign,
    tolerant philosophy.  <BR> <BR>By the way, Popper did point out, as Guillaume
    notes, that the socialist revolution taking place first in a poor country &#40;Russia&#41;
    refutes Marx. It is in fact an example of how social facts are important to testing
    theories in social science and politics, as well as physical science.  <BR> <BR>

  body: 'I know pretty well that contradictions are permitted. I&#39;d say hopefully,
    because if not all arguing become sterile and dead. As for me, the socrate tradition
    is rotten. One man asks questions with the answers inside, and the poor partner
    only can say &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;exactly&#34; or synonyms. Not fruiful, in my
    view. Socrate was really interesting, and beautiful in many ways, but he was also
    a pure dogmatist, not really interested in ideas of others, mocking of revolutionary
    people who wanted to discuss slavery etc. He was, also, a very fine rhetorician.
    <BR>The acknolewdgement of sufferings caused by policies is, of course, important.

  body: '&#62;The thing is that you really absoloutly want to judge. You don&#39;t
    want just to learn and build a living on a fruitful learning, which doesn&#39;t
    necessary evaluate. <BR> <BR>Guillaume, the idea that you yourself don&#39;t make
    judgments is a mistaken idea.  <BR> <BR>You make a judgment every time to decide
    to eat the food rather than the plate, every time you step over a hole in the
    road.  <BR> <BR>You also make judgments of other people and political judgments
    - such as the one you made above about bad things that went on in the Soviet Union.
    We all make judgments, I just think it is a better idea to make them after looking
    at evidence and grounding them as much in reality as possible. Using logic and
    reason is part of being a responsibile human being. So is being open-minded enough
    to accept new evidence and argument and change one&#39;s mind.  <BR> <BR>The relativist&#39;s
    claim not to make judgments is just pretense, not reality. It shows the hollowness
    of the philosophy.  <BR> <BR>I never said that Nazis or Communists were relativists.
    I said that Heidegger and Sartre used relativism to defend them. My point was
    that once you break loose your standards from evidence and reality, anything goes.  <BR>
    <BR>I see from your bio here that you are a student. If you are interested you
    can get Popper&#39;s works in French. I think &#39;Conjectures and Refutations&#39;
    is his best. My own book on Popper, &#39;Learning from Error&#39; is in English
    and a German translation &#40;Lernen aus dem Irrtum&#41;, but not in French.  <BR>
    <BR>&#62;If enough people are involved, calling something a &#39;leg&#39;, does
    actually make it a leg. If the Oxford English Dictionary says it&#39;s a leg,
    who am I to argue?  <BR> <BR>With all due respect, Matha, you miss the point of
    Lincoln&#39;s story: changing language doesn&#39;t change reality. The fixing
    of meaning is conventional - the sound &#39;he&#39; refers to a man in English
    and to a woman in Hebrew. But once the meanings are relatively fixed in a language
    community, then sentences refer to reality, and are true or false. The reality
    doesn&#39;t change even though we may get it wrong or fail to understand it.  <BR>
    <BR>For example once &#39;weapons of mass destruction&#39; is given a clear meaning,
    the claim that they were in Iraq gets meaning, and the reality of whether they
    were there or not doesn&#39;t change no matter what George Bush or Hans Blix says.
    <BR> <BR>The idea that language determines reality is such a crock. Eating keeps
    us alive, sex makes babies - and you don&#39;t need talk when you are doing either
    one!  <BR> <BR>&#62;William, I see your point, but I guess we must have  <BR>different
    tresholds, no offense. <BR> <BR>Yves, no offense given or taken. I noted the rudeness
    because don&#39;t think it should be accepted as a normal course of action, on
    these boards or anywhere else.   <BR> <BR>&#62;instead of taking advice <BR> <BR>Hrant,
    I recently accepted 100% of your typographic advice on my book project, and thanked
    you for your kindness. And meant it. '

    discussion that comes into this board. <BR> <BR>As I said at the start of my discussing
    relativism, I did it reluctantly, having resisted earlier, but because it has

    that there are other well developed alternatives to relativism - and that it is
    in the view of some, including me, profoundly illiberal - I jumped in.  <BR> <BR>And
    evidently there were a number of people interested in discussing the issue.  <BR>
    <BR>Having made clear that there is a well-developed alternative - by Popper and

  body: 'About the leg and the tail: <BR> <BR>Matha, yes we can start calling a dog&#39;s
    tail a leg, and if we establish the convention it might stick. But most people
    want language to be useful -- not perfect, not all revealing and encompassing
    -- just useful for talking about the reality around them. Calling a dog&#39;s
    tail a leg doesn&#39;t change the nature of the thing attached to a dog&#39;s
    arse. It remains pysically different from the other things we call leg. So by
    calling tails legs we&#39;ve just made language less useful because we&#39;ve
    removed the linguistic distinction between things that are distinct in reality.
    <BR> <BR>Now, and this is quite interesting, language reflects cultural priorities
    insofar as language embodies classification. The distinction between tail and
    leg is one of classification, and the fact that we have two separate words for
    them indicates that we consider the classification to be important. It is conceivable
    that there is another culture that would have a single word for &#39;long skinny
    things attached to the body of a dog&#39;, which would be used for both legs and
    tails. Such a word would indicate that this culture has never considered the physical
    or functional differences between legs and tails to be important: they have different
    priorities in classification. <BR> <BR>So language reflects priority in the classification
    of reality, but it does not affect the nature of that which is classified: the
    physical and functional distinctions between legs and tails persist whether a
    language defines the distinctions or not. Calling a tail a leg does not change
    the dog, only the language.'

    everytime it&#39;s used, it become a more complex &#40;and confusing&#41; thing,
    made of phonems, letters, significations, voice, attitude etc. You can&#39;t separate

    irrelevant, and not only that it is dangerous. We can and should, for example,
    demand a specific definition of &#39;weapons of mass destruction&#39; from our
    political leaders, and they can and should provide such a definition: it is possible
    to state what they mean, even if it isn&#39;t in their interests to do so. The
    vagueness isn&#39;t in the language, it is in the intention not to use language
    clearly. <BR> <BR>Between the vain idea of a perfect language, in which there
    is a one-to-one natural correspondence of word and thing, and the vain idea of
    total deconstruction of meaning in which there is no correspondence of word and
    thing other than a momentary and individual interpretive one, there is the linguistic
    world that most people operate in on a daily basis. There are conventional correspondences
    between words and things embodied in usage, and these can be explained and understood
    in terms of a matrix of such correspondences. So when I say &#39;This is a duck&#39;,
    I can go on to explain what a bird is, what distinguishes this duck bird from
    other birds, and can relate all these concepts to physical specimens. There is
    no one-to-one natural correspondence between the word duck and the thing duck,
    not least because there are different breeds of duck and the word duck is also
    a verb that has nothing to do with water fowl, but we have adequate functionality
    of language in talking about the thing we call a duck. If the functionality wasn&#39;t
    adequate, we would make it adequate by devising new ways of talking about the
    thing, which is something at which we are very adapt. <BR> <BR>As an aside, the

    <BR>Yes, language is sometimes ambiguous, a social product, and some concepts
    &#40;such as justice&#41; are interpreted differently by different cultures.  <BR>
    <BR>All this does not change the fact that there are a huge number of simple facts
    on which almost everyone agrees: that there many different languages, that we
    need food to live, and so on. It is this very broad agreement on observed facts
    that provides a basis for testing more general ideas, and for cross-cultural communication.  <BR>
    <BR>The reality of many ambiguities in language does not answer my, and Popper&#39;s
    point that these basic agreed-upon observations &#40;including of observation
    of human suffering&#41; provide a basis for common communication and for meaningful
    debate in science and politics. <BR> <BR>Matha, if you do not address the importance
    of cross-culturally agreed-upon observational facts, then you are not answering
    Popper&#39;s argument against relativism.   <BR> <BR>Guillaume, I think your concept
    of &#39;absolute truth&#39; does not characterize Popper&#39;s view. He distinguishes
    between truth in the ordinary sense of the statement &#39;most dogs are born with
    four legs&#39; being true, and the sense of Truth being about the meaning of life
    etc. Incidently, if you are interested, the logician Alfred Tarski defined this
    simple sense of &#39;truth&#39; in formal logic. <BR> <BR>Your view that we cannot
    get closer to the truth, and therefore the concept of truth is useless, is one
    which Popper would contest. For example, we are closer to understanding the truth
    about the nature of the moon than people were a thousand years ago. <BR> <BR>Having
    already tried the patience of those not interested in philosophy, I am reluctant
    to go further in this thread. My article &#39;Skeptical Rationalism&#39; &#40;Inquiry,
    22, p. 281-230&#41; lays out my own views in depth.  <BR> <BR>The main question
    I would have for Matha and Guillaume is: What is gained by being a relativist?
    If you think the answer is a more tolerant point of view, I think you are making
    a serious mistake - though one that has nothing to do with type!  <BR> <BR>   '

    go shouting Q.E.D. quite yet, William. I can see that you truly believe in science
    &#40;which is fine by me&#41; but I wonder how repeatable such scientific observations
    would be if the number of people tested was increased to something really really
    enormous. A test involving millions or billions is obviously outside the scope
    of any scientific study but would most likely reveal patterns far less repeatable
    than in anything done so far. The relatively small scale of scientific studies
    like this hides more than it reveals. <BR> <BR>I recently read that in a worldwide
    study, women were discovered to be better than men at reading in 100% of partcipating

    than every single man? More women tested better in each country?  <BR> <BR>Matha'

    exactly does this mean? <BR> <BR>Probably that the tests were biased, as all tests
    are. That doesn&#39;t mean the tests were invalid scientifically, just that the
    results were misconstrued -- it&#39;s a mistake to say that one sex is better
    than another at reading, because it&#39;s not a sport. <BR> <BR>When Colin Weildon
    did his reading research, he decided to measure &#34;comprehension&#34;, by burying
    information in a story, and seeing how well it was recalled by various readers
    &#40;also measuring the effect of varying typeface&#41;. That kind of reading
    research is very different from the physiological investigation in the present
    meme, which really plays to guys, as wiitnessed by its popularity at Slashdot.
    <BR> <BR>Were these &#34;better women readers&#34; adults or children? <BR> <BR>Recent
    reading tests on children that use books generally favor girls, because boys prefer
    to read words in the context of video games, baseball cards, and web sites with
    lots of buttons, rather than in sucky books &#40;notwithstanding Harry Potter&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>But that doesn&#39;t mean boys aren&#39;t reading. <BR> <BR>In fact,
    the process of reading evolves all the time. When it was first invented, everbody
    always read out loud. The first to do it silently were viewed as very strange
    fish. <BR> <BR>That tid-bit is from Alberto Manguel&#39;s &#34;A History of Reading&#34;,
