body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI would like to present to you a typeface of mine. It's a somewhat
  organic serif typeface with subtle Middle-Eastern influences. There's definitely
  a lot of refining to do, but meanwhile I would like to gather your opinions and
  criticism.\r\n\r\nI also have some letters of a sans companion but I abandoned that
  for now because I first need to get the basic set of the serif right. I will also
  leave the display version until the regular version is done but I still wanted to
  show what I have.\r\n\r\nI'm aware of half the problems in this typeface but I'm
  curious about the problems I didn't see yet. This typeface is technically more advanced
  than what I've done before so it's particularly challenging to balance the weight
  and keep the design consistent, but I'm learning a lot from it. Let me know what
  you think.\r\n"

  body: "Yes, the italic is rather challenging and I've actually not really decided
    which direction to take it yet. Right now I'm most happy with the lowercase roman,
    but even that needs a lot of work still.\r\n\r\nI wanted the /f to curve into
    itself but looking at it again it just looks cramped. I will raise the ascender
    and make the shape more open.\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions of typefaces
    I might look at for inspiration regarding the italics?"

    of the italics of [[http://www.eyalmyrthe.nl/letterontwerpen.php|Kristal]]? I
    think I might like to do something quite drastic with the italics. I believe your
    philosophy is that italics shouldn't contrast too much with the roman, right?
    Any thoughts?"

    \"headstrong\" to do the job of an Italic (which I do indeed feel generally needs

  body: "The proportions seem a little off to me. I'd make e and r a little wider,
    and t a little narrower. The gaps in your display don't seem to follow a clear
    logic, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but be aware of it. Right now, to
    me it looks a little bit like you can't decide between stencil and non-stencil.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not going to repeat the obvious potential in your work every time, but remember
    that all feedback is positive feedback. People take the time to comment = people

  body: "@Frode: Thanks a lot! The lowercase /a was the starting point of the typeface
    and  the glyph I'm possibly most proud of, of any glyph I've drawn so far. I'm
    glad to see you guys see the potential.\r\n\r\n@Jasper: You don't need to remind
    me of the value of feedback. Particularly since I have no formal education in
    type design I appreciate feedback tremendously because you guys often spot \"errors\"
    I missed or lacked an awareness of the problem in question to fix or improve the
    characters. You can be as brutal in your criticism as you want as long as it's
    constructive.\r\n\r\nI agree with the proportional issues you mentioned. The /r
    is always a problematic letter for me, actually. I think the /r in combination
    with a lot of other letters create a gap between the two letters which is too
    wide. A contextual ligature would do well here but I always try to resolve the
    gap issue as much as possible without having to utilize OpenType features. I certainly
    went too far with compensating for the gap here.\r\n\r\nAs for the display version,
    I wasn't trying to create a stencil letter and so it indeed lacks the consistency
    of a stencil. It's just that I thought this typeface works well in high contrast
    for display uses and I wanted a few characters to stand out a bit more. Perhaps
    it's indeed too much like a stencil, but I don't want to abandon the idea just
    yet. It's good to know I might have taken it too much towards a stencil design
    though."

  body: "Here's a new preview of Aghari. I have a few deadlines for other work so
    I don't have time for a lot updates, but here are some:\r\n\u2022 I made the /r
    wider and slightly raised the shoulder.\r\n\u2022 I made the /s wider and changed
    the proportions and top serif a bit.\r\n\u2022 I slightly condensed /t and replaced
    /s and /t in the s_t ligature with updated characters.\r\n\u2022 I made /e a bit
    wider and slightly changed the weight distribution.\r\n\u2022 I changed the proportions
    of /f. \r\n\u2022 I increased the ascenders a bit.\r\n\u2022 I added /E and /F.\r\n\u2022
    I balanced out /z and /Z.\r\n\u2022 I improved the bowl of /a.\r\n\r\nAny other
    criticism is very welcome. Also, does anyone have tips for the design of /o,/O
    and the bowl of /g? I want to bring some tension in the weight distribution to
    make the shapes look more dynamic, but it's hard to balance symmetrical outlines
    with diagonal counters. I should possibly have a closer look at Legato.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aghari-Regular-v18_4397.jpg]"

  body: "I love the /v/!\r\nFor /O/o/, see how it would look with a smoother, rounder
    outside contour--get the weight distribution and character you want from messing
    with the inner contour. My hypothesis is that the eye has more patience for funkiness
    in the counter shape if the overall glyph is predictably circular. \r\nThe thick-thin-thick
    spine of /s/ is inelegant to my eye. \r\nShortness of that /f/ may be odd in words
    with other ascenders. \r\nEar of /g/ and spur of /G/ may be out of character.
    \r\nCrossbar of /t/ looks a bit like a truck ran over it!\r\nTop terminal of /C/G/
    may be a little too limp. "

  body: Thanks for the criticism. Do you have a suggestion for the ear of /g? It's
    closer to the shoulder of /r, but I'm wondering if /r stands out too much. On
    the other hand, complete consistency is boring. Obviously the characters need
    to look like they belong to the same typeface, but I do want to keep individuality
    and try to make the letters work together more dynamically. Alegreya comes to
    mind for some reason.

    time and provide some short texts so you can judge the typeface better. Here are
    the changes:\r\n\u2022 I raised the ascender of /f, changed the terminal and lowered
    the horizontal bar to interact better with /i.\r\n\u2022 I changed the bowl and
    ear of /g and made the links a bit more robust. I also changed the composition
    a bit.\r\n\u2022 I lowered the tittles of i/j.\r\n\u2022 I made the /o a bit more
    square and changed the angle of the counter.\r\n\u2022 I decreased the width of
    /r a bit and changed the terminal. I also increased the right side of the base.\r\n\u2022
    I changed the spine and curvature of /s and updated the s_t ligature.\r\n\u2022
    I made the crossbar of /t more straight and decreased the details.\r\n\u2022 I
    changed the terminals in C/G and modified the whole shape.\r\n\u2022 I decreased
    the width of E/F , made the top terminal more vertical and sharpened the top of
    the terminal a bit.\r\n\r\nI'm not yet satisfied with the ear of /g in particular.
    Next time I will give it another go.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aghari-Regular-v19_6106.jpg]"
