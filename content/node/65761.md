  that I found was on the box for a computer game - but try as I might, I could not
  identify it. Finally, I took a picture, and submitted that to MyFonts' electronic
  match, but although that let me find Adobe Present from the Omniglot logo, it didn't
  find the match for this one:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/word_4581.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  seems to be a plain but calligraphic font... but I don't think they used hand lettering.
  (Although the letters did have a 3-D effect, so I suppose it's possible...)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/word4_5634.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  here's another sample. I would think this should be simple and obvious to find,
  but it has turned out not to be."

    I have found so far was something called [[http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/13378?text=Mercenary|pehuensito,

  body: "<cite>Frankly, I would consider a more skilled (professional) font, like
    Jubilee or Post Antiqua, rather than this poorly executed calligraphic font.</cite>\r\n\r\nI'll
    agree with that, but while my previous searches had turned up Jubilee and Post
    Antiqua, I've been wishing I could find a closer match.\r\n\r\nPost Roman might
    be what I'm looking for, but it doesn't seem to have been digitized, so I can't
    find a more extensive sample online to compare.\r\n\r\nJubilee is clearly a typeface,
    not calligraphic hand lettering.\r\n\r\nBasically, the reason I thought that this
    particular style of type was a good substitute for Papyrus was because it wasn't
    elaborate like an uncial face, or even like Motto (compare [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/mikadan/|Mikadan]]
    although that's closer to Verona, also more elaborate) or Freehand (compare [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/duly-noted-nf/|Duly
    Noted]]).\r\n\r\nSo, basically, think of something like Lydian, but with just
    a minimum of pointy serifs added, just barely enough to say \"calligraphy\", while
    avoiding tagging the font with too specific a time and place - because that's
    the virtue of Papyrus."

  body: "<cite>Have you searched through Part 4 and 6 of my Script Font ID Guide?</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    have searched through Part 4, but not Part 6, so I will do so. And Scrivano and
    Amanda were also fonts I noticed in my frantic searches. I also referred to some
    print references I have as well, but I have a few others buried in clutter I need
    to dig out and look at.\r\n\r\nAs you've pointed out, there are letterspacing
    problems, so it may be that this is a very obscure font; I was hoping that there
    would still be a much closer match that is a real and well-known font - since
    the shape of the letters seemed familiar to me - but maybe I was wrong."

    I encountered the closest matches yet:\r\nTrieste, Oxalis Alternate, Oz Brush;\r\n\r\nand
    some other faces that closely resemble what I was looking for:\r\nRana, Oak Wood,
    Malandra, FF Elegie Regular, Holly;\r\n\r\nand some others I hadn't mentioned
    in my other posts about possible alternates to Papyrus, but which might also serve
    that purpose:\r\nPolaris, Clichee, Gararond, Charon, Demi Tasse, Rhino (Mobil)\r\n\r\nIn
    there were also several other faces (like Ereshkigal and Prsent) that I have already
    noted - or acknowledged when mentioned by others - as possible Papyrus alternatives."

  body: "Actually, though, when I looked up the candidates there, I still didn't find
    a real match - for those I could find a larger illustration, it turned out they
    were different.\r\n\r\nBut I think you are right, and this doesn't exist as a
    \"real\" font, even if it is some obscure free font somewhere. Also, in the samples
    I provided, I see I failed to include one with a significant distinguishing feature
    of the design. The bottom right-pointing serif of the lowercase L is so big that
    it can be mistaken for an uppercase L. Another reason to think that it's likely
    just some amateur calligraphy.\r\n\r\nBut I still saw much of what I was looking
    for, because even if I can't find an exact match, identifying that font was just
    a part of my search for alternatives to Papyrus - and I did find several of those
    in that area."

    The e's, r's etc. are all identical and the s was the crown. Notice it's backslant...

    in weight relationships and overall weight. In my ongoing vigil to keep an eye
    on my fonts I search the \"free\" sites all the time and I have seen a number
    of these naive \"roundhand\" forms.\r\n\r\n Michael"
