  features a rather lovely italic serif for its masthead.\r\n\r\nInitially, I thought
  it was a Barnbrook face due to the seated italic U, I was wrong.\r\n\r\nAnybody
  have an idea as to which typeface they've used here?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/found-logo3_5870.png]"

  body: "Barnbrook is a very good guess. But I suspect it's a one-off using multiple
    fonts. For one thing the weights are a bit imbalanced (which however happens a
    lot these days with so much junky free stuff out there).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
