  body: Tiffany&#39;s willingness to help is admirable. But I can&#39;t help thinking
    there&#39;s something really wrong when a designer&#40;?&#41; who&#39;s commissioned
    to design a commemorative book for a long-established firm comes to a forum like
    this and asks what font&#40;s&#41; they should be using. Call me mean-spirited
    &#40;and I&#39;m sure someone will&#41;, but this is a bit pathetic.

  body: 'Sorry, it was the wrong question. Perhaps my english is to bad. <BR> <BR>The
    thing is: I have money for the fonts and want to try something new. There are
    a lot of nice fonts on my mac. But perhaps there are nice fonts produced over
    the last month i never heard about that are good for use in this project. You
    know what i mean. I don&#39;t want to hear fonts like garamond or itc quay. I&#39;am
    interested in &#34;underused&#34; fonts'

  body: Andrew, exactly what&#39;s the point of such a forum if it&#39;s pathetic
    to ask for advice from people who are willing and able to help? <BR> <BR>As long
    as Timo doesn&#39;t take undue credit for other people&#39;s ideas, what&#39;s
    the problem? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
