body: "Hi,\r\ni am searching for a font which is used in EA's 1999 Need For Speed
  High Stakes (NFS4 EA Canada). Thought of using it for some Artwork.\r\nIts mostly
  used in headlines, although it seems to have only lowercase letters.\r\nThe font
  is stored in a file called \"Galext18.ffn\" ... maybe thats helpful (btw renaming
  to *.ttf does not work).\r\nIn the attached image I cut together different samples
  from menu and loading screens. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unknown_6037.png]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI
  couldnt find any information so far and \"What the Font\" did not show any helpful
  results. Are there other image based search engines?\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome
  to have at least a similar font.\r\n\r\nThx4Reading\r\nGreetings"
