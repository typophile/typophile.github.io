  body: pauldhunt that&#39;s me and it was a vintage Speedball lettering book &#40;that
    webdiner beat me on&#41;. I think an identical one went up today tho, so hopefully
    i&#39;ll get it this time! oh and another ATF catalog went up today, but i&#39;ve
    spent too much money on books this month already.

    <BR>is another easy place to get the  <BR> Ross F. George Speedball handbooks.
    <BR>Sometimes I&#39;ll see something on ebay <BR>and find it cheaper via the bookfinder  <BR>network.

  body: I&#39;ve already got a copy, so I&#39;m no hurting any. I just thought if
    I could get it cheap I&#39;d donate it to the TypeCon or ATypI auction or some
    such. Or give it to somebody as a present. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Perhaps we should have somekind of online archive of the type spec books we
    all have. It would be a slow process to scan in all the pages, but winter is coming...
    <BR> <BR>I also got an email today from Brian about a book we were both bidding
    on, I think it was very nice of him to drop out of a auction when he noticed he
    was bidding against a fellow typophile, and I&#39;ll be checking who is bidding
    before jumping in, and trying not to bid against typophiles.
