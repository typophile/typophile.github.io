  that we need to design supporting materials for our client. The closest we could
  find was Avenir, but it's just not close enough. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SA-Type_3938.jpg]\r\n\r\nAll
  help is much appreciated,\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMichael"

    to me. \r\nI'd say probably Neutra Text Book (not Alternate) for the grey text,
    and Neutra Text Demi Italic (also not Alternate) for the red?\r\n\r\nEdit: Argh,
    late! :)"
