  body: Think of it in terms of what mathematicians simply enjoy doing. It's not going
    to have any appreciable impact on graphic design in the long run, I shouldn't
    think!

  body: I could see Target doing this to produce even more permutations of its already
    versatile and malleable logo to play with in advertising and on packaging. A record,
    book, or game publisher could slap a new permutation on every release. It could
    make an entire product line collectible. And a blog could explain the math behind
    every permutation. Sort of like what Fossil has done with all of its logos over
    the years, but nerdier and without so much drawing.
