  body: The Jpeg process has been unkind to both, but to my eyes, the one on top&#39;s
    fuzzy around the edges. It was probably screenshotted from a nice scan and sampled
    down. <BR> <BR>The one on the bottom shows a &#42;great&#42; sharp cleaving to
    the pixel, looking a lot more like print to my eye. If &#34;soulless&#34; means
    ignoring subtleties on the altar of Speed and Progress, sure, the above sucks
    more. The only other difference I can see is the spacing. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/16676.gif"
    alt="difference filter between old and new logos"> <BR>The upper one was a tad
    bigger so I scaled it down - still - I can&#39;t really see the different cut
    to Franklin onscreen. The only difference besides the fuzzy edges is the obvious
    letterspacing. No comment on that though I&#39;m reading <u>Stop Stealing Sheep</u>
    &#40;great stuff&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#39;Hideous&#39; means shockingly ugly. Both
    designs are competent and have similar &#39;boumas&#39;. The difference seems
    more of a gnat&#39;s whisker/RCH. Please, someone scan the new and old ones and
    REALLY compare the difference.
