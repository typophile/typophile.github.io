  body: I&#39;m sure this has been discussed many time before. Perhaps we need an
    FAQ, or a database in which people can go and see which letters which designers
    start with. <BR> <BR>For the record, in a Latin typeface I usually start with
    <i>i</i>&#40;<i>l</i>&#41;<i>n</i>&#40;<i>mh</i>&#41;<i>p</i>&#40;<i>bdq</i>&#41;<i>aeg</i>.
    The letters in parentheses are usually roughed in as soon as I have enough related
    forms. My first test word is usually <i>nihilim</i>.

    o is an o-acute&#41;.  <BR>This word provides a good introduction to elements
    that can be initially transferred but also need fiddling with &#40;n-h-i&#41;;
    an equally good introduction to more individual letters &#40;a&#41;  includes
    middle bars &#40;the a and e&#41; which are strong determinants of typographic
    colour; makes people think about diacritics from the start; and, courtesy of the
    s, can give rise to lots of discussions on bezier techniques. Avoiding the g is
    in my view important, as it is quite difficult for beginners, and with a wider
    acceptable design space within each style.  <BR>The letters in &#34;adhesion&#34;
    also allow decent texts to be composed, so that people can begin proofing the
    texture of the typeface pretty early in the process.

  body: '&#62; Could you show me an example of a &#34;good&#34; italic and a &#34;bad&#34;
    that you have in mind? <BR> <BR>My pleasure!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s much easier
    to point out &#34;bad&#34; ones &#40;although I want to clarify that I find them
    only ideologically bad - usually they&#39;re generally &#34;usable&#34; italics,
    whatever that means&#41; because there&#39;s so many of them. Basically the italics
    that are fed an extra IV-shot of chirography &#40;hand-based design&#41; as a
    means of either pulling them away from the roman, or &#40;worse&#41; expressing
    some misplaced artistic preference, are &#34;bad&#34;. Usually this means the
    italic is drawn from scratch, and this generally detracts from its function as
    a style subordinate to the [hopefully more typographic] roman. Of course, an italic
    also does indeed need to stand out sufficiently from a body of roman, but there&#39;s
    plenty of leeway to do that without resorting to Stone Age nostalgia. BTW, an
    alternative, secondary italic that&#39;s highly chirographic is functionally fine
    &#40;although ideologicaly still a no-no&#41;. Heck, you can even make one of
    those now-fashionable &#34;upright italics&#34;, but: don&#39;t pretend it works
    the way users need an italic to work; I think it would be better to call that
    a &#34;cursive roman&#34;. <BR> <BR>As for &#34;good&#34; ones, they&#39;re very
    rare. I notice one once in a blue moon, but an italic that I&#39;ve admired for
    a while is Octavian&#39;s&#42;. Although it&#39;s still a bit too chirographic
    for my tastes, at least it matches its roman in that, so it doesn&#39;t use chirography
    as a drag queen outfit. Also, although I don&#39;t pretend it&#39;s the best thing
    since sliced bread, but I have tried to express my ideal-italic theories in my
    own work, specifically Patria&#42;&#42;. It still needs some effort before it&#39;s
    ready &#40;like optical slant correction, and length adjustment in some serifs
    and beaks&#41; but I&#39;m proud of the fact that the outlines are in fact mathematically
    derived from the same source as the roman &#40;with some subsequent adjustment&#41;
    but people still think it&#39;s usable &#40;unlike the Morison stuff&#41;. <BR>

  body: I am amazed at Hrant&#39;s statement about good and bad italics. <BR> <BR>Is
    not a slanted roman really an oblique? And I thought a true italic was really
    a seperate design that in modern type compliments a roman in weight and color
    ...etc. <BR> <BR>I think of a slanted roman as a &#39;bad&#39; italic, as it adds
    nothing to the family/face and is more a product of digital bastardization than
    actual design. <BR> <BR>As too renaming italics as cursive romans - well, that
    kinda ignores historical issues, such as italics by nature were a representation
    of hand writing, no? So, why not leave that alone? Why rename something that is
    aptly named and is correct in its lable? <BR> <BR>One could argue that romans
    should have no italic, as italics historicaly stood on their own. But to say that
    only slanted romans are useful and good seems a bit of a stretch to this amatuer
    type guy. <BR> <BR>Hrant, maybe I am misunderstanding your comments. Would you

    point, and it is interesting to look over the illustration above while concentrating
    on the counter axis. There is less variation in the counter axis of the o and
    other letters than is apparent when one looks at the modulation of the whole letter.
    There are also, though, some surprises: the axis of the counter of the Calisto
    o is actually rotated slightly <i>anti</i>clockwise compared to the d. Never noticed
    that before.'

  body: Mike, I agree that mechanically slanted romans suck. Morison&#39;s mistake
    was that he failed to temper his ideology with design sense &#40;probably because
    he had none of the latter&#41;. What I&#39;m advocating is non-chirographic italics,
    which isn&#39;t the same thing at all. It is counter to the essence of typography
    to use chirography to differentiate two styles, just like romans themselves can
    be more or less chirographic &#40;and I think the latter are weaker&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Such an italic can even be drawn seperately than the roman, as long as it
    harmonizes <i>in its subordinate role</i>. The primary contemporary function of
    an italic is to emphasize words in a body of roman - that&#39;s how users use
    the stuff. And all an italic really needs to perform this primary funciton is
    slant &#40;although lighter color and other divergences can help too, especially
    if the slant is slight&#41;. Any other use of an italic &#40;such as for an independent
    body of text&#41; is strictly secondary. That at least isn&#39;t dogma, it&#39;s
    pragmatism. <BR> <BR>BTW, I think multiple italics are a great idea. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    it adds nothing <BR> <BR>You could say it&#39;s not supposed to add anything,
    it&#39;s just supposed to not detract from functionality. An italic that&#39;s
    more chirographic than its roman diluted the focus of the overall design. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; cursive romans <BR> <BR>I meant that only in reference to what&#39;s
    called &#34;upright italics&#34;, like in Seria and Unibody. I have no problem
    calling slanted italics &#34;italics&#34; &#40;as long as they&#39;re not merely
    obliques&#41;, not least because a new term would confuse things! But I think
    &#34;cursive roman&#34; is a better description for upright italics, simply because
    slant is the primary determinant for the <i>user</i>, who as a layman has no idea
    about chirographic versus typographic structures &#40;certainly not consciously&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; historical issues, such as italics by nature were a representation
    of hand writing <BR> <BR>1&#41; What&#39;s more important, the past or the future?
    <BR>2&#41; Hey, romans came from there too! But now they&#39;ve broken free &#40;although
    still not enough, yet&#41; - so let&#39;s do the same favor for italics. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; to say that only slanted romans are useful and good <BR> <BR>I was careful
    to say that chirographic italics can be -and are- &#34;useful&#34; to many -probably
    most- people. <BR>But there&#39;s a difference between what the masses casually
    choose versus how culture progresses. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    wondered if I had not quite understood the essence of what you were saying. <BR>
    <BR>I would also agree that usage should be a primary conscern when designing,
    so an italic should be valued for its ability to do its job. <BR> <BR>But, having
    said that, I would argue that something that has proven successful for hundreds
    of years is rooted in useability. Maybe not always, but a high percentage of successful
    design is based on historical evolutions. <BR> <BR>Thanks for taking the time
