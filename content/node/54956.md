body: Is there any kind of online list or search engine that compares paper prices?
  I hate to bug my printer to have him quote a job on a bunch of different papers
  if I could easily rule out ones that I knew would be too expensive. I haven't been
  able to find anything online that gets me remotely close to figuring out how the
  price of one paper compares to another. I know prices can vary widely depending
  on how much a printer buys (among other factors), but even a simple list that says
  that in general, Mohawk Navajo is more expensive than Finch Opaque, which is more
  expensive than whatever. Does anything like this exist, or does everyone just bug
  their printers?

    variables along the way that affect pricing.\r\n\r\nThat said, as a designer,
    you should be able to buy driectly from the distributors, and they should have
    easy comparison lists for you. "
