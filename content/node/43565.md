  body: When you know what you're looking for it's always a good idea to do a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=nl&q=site%3Atypophile.com+lula+mag&btnG=Zoeken&lr=">Search</a>
    first. "Lula mag" is a recurring identification request around these parts.

    and you\u2019ll see there is no usable response from the site. \r\n\r\nI\u2019d
    scratch the search-box above, and would substitute it with a google search-button
    or else. Google offers things like that \u2026\r\n\r\nBut, I know, that\u2019s
    the wrong place for discussing it. "

    and restrict the finds to site:typophile.com.

    site just once or twice? \r\n\r\nI think I remember a ribbon from a year or so
    where it said \xBBSearch is Beta-version\xAB or else. Maybe that should lead one
    or two hasty people to use another search method. "
