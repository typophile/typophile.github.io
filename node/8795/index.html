		<div class="commentbody">I had forgotten about the Dynamic Graphics stuff. They did the &quot;Clipper&quot; series of stuff right? I suppose I always associated their stuff with the 80s, since we had stacks of their catalogs at the print shop I worked at in the early 90s, and they were filled with Nagel rip off illos for nail salons and &quot;half off designer fashions&quot; ads, along with checkerboard patterns, paint splats, and other assorted 80s-ness. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Isn't the Letraset stuff mostly patterns and what not?

		<div class="commentbody">So, Nick, are you saying I should learn to appreciate all of that bad Nagel-esque art? I guess when I start designing retro 80s album covers or rock posters, I'll be wishing I had a collection of that stuff to. ;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the serious side, I don't see appropriating bad 60s/70s art as any different from using old Victorian art in an ironic way. We as designers have a massive amount of visuals available to us, and we know very well the power of recontexualizing imagery. Plus, without that concept, we wouldn't have great artists like Ed Fotheringham or great designers like Art Chantry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim &ndash; thanks for the heads up on the older Letraset catalogs, I'll see what I can dig up.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;appropriating bad 60s/70s art <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sean, I have a number of objections to your method of &quot;recontextualizing&quot; as a modus operandi. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the first place, it's intellectually lazy. I could be more forgiving if I thought that, like Max Ernst (Une Semaine de Bonte), you would be using collage to create startling surrealist juxtapositions. But the trends today are &quot;retro is cool&quot;, and &quot;scrap-booking is us&quot; which aren't the same.  Please explain why &quot;bad is good&quot; is not just banal. Surely, when we've had the ghetto DIY retro T-shirt featured in a Macdonald's campaign, this trend is over. Or as they say now, &quot;so gay&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the second place, it's plain old lazy, using pre-fabricated materiel for one's art, especially clip art.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thirdly, why not express your own era in an original way, using the media of today creatively, rather than just shuffle around cliches? Yes, I know the problem that it so easily comes out looking slick and corporate, but shouldn't we make some attempt to move beyond self-loathing? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fourth, why not support your peers &ndash; illustrators. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fifth, (to add to Tiffany's distinction between good art and bad art in cliches) specific to your production method: by using retro clip art to poke fun at an era, you are taking a cheap shot. Of course, because it would have cost a lot more, or been illegal, to use original art from the era, or commission/originate something in that style.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Besides, who are you trying to fool? &ndash; Fess up, you're a kitsch-fiend, you actually like that bad old stuff at face value but are too embarrassed to admit it, and so hide behind an &quot;ironic&quot; posture :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tim, it wasn't the retro stock images I was respecting, but the style of the era they came from.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In general, stock is detrimental to artists/photographers, because it lowers the price that can be charged for original commissioned work, and because it puts so much of the fee into the pockets of middlemen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, there is some stock, such as the recent Getty theatre shoot, that would be prohibitively expensive to commission. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm also somewhat hypocritical, having released a set of retro RF stock photos on fStop, but those shots are original now, in a sense, in that they've never been released before.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am prejudiced against retro, based on how people typically repurpose old images. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, once in a while I come across something old-new that's different, like The Triplets of Belleville.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, you have some good points, but as you mentioned, folks like Max Ernst have used existing art to create new art. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The work that I'm doing lately is rock posters (which I do for free tickets and free beer, so that's why I don't hire an artist &ndash; there ain't no money to do so). The audience I'm designing for enjoys kitsch imagery, it will bring people to the shows. The bands like the posters for same reasons. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why is &quot;bad is good&quot; not just banal? Borrowing from the definition of irony from the dictionary: The use of images to express something different from and often opposite to their literal meaning, and employing such contrasts for humorous or rhetorical effect. I like irony. I guess that the design style that appeals to me most has a touch of humor to it. Something to engage the viewer, give them a little personal interaction with the piece. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slick corporate work (gosh though, a lot of that uses stock photos doesn't it?) is the pablum of the design world. Any half-assed designer can knock out brochures that have an image of some business transaction and some type set in Garamond. We've all had to do work like that. It's boring. Not to say that it can't be done amazingly well, but most of it is bad. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In my day job, I commision over $100,000 a year in new art. I love commissioning art. It's fun, I get to pay artists well for work that they enjoy doing. It's given me a huge amount of professional pride in doing right by artists. But that's my day job. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm a big fan of Art Chantry (I've taken classes from him, and enjoyed talking to him as well), and Jeff Kleinsmith. The craft that goes into that work is keen. I dig it. Repurposing art is a cool way of speaking to the audience. I don't design that way for a financial brochure, but I sure as hell will for a rock poster. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There's some other folks I'm not real keen on. Charles S. Anderson is one of them. The whole CSA archive seemed like a really cool idea to me, until they started to sell the images. I have books of clip with images from the 50s that are on CSA's web site, does that mean I can't use that stuff? Ridiculous. They copped images from the same sources that I did. There's line art of masks from the back of Famous Monsters of Filmland, there's stuff from old ad cuts and printer's clip books, however, to their credit, there's new stuff that is done in that style as well. I wish that CSA had kept those images to themselves instead of selling them. Something just seems wrong with re-copyrighting expired material. I used to love Anderson's design work (and I still like the old stuff), but it's become such a vehicle to sell their art now, I feel as though it's just as bad as that boring corporate work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Am I a kitsch fiend? Sure. I love kitsch. I like that it's ironic, that it looks old, from another era, and I love that it is bad. It's like bad television. When I watch Fantasy Island or Knight Rider, I know it's bad. The direction, acting, set design, and plotting are all sub par. Yet, for some reason, you can enjoy it, if you put away your opinion of it's inate crappiness. You enjoy the crap. It's the same reason I like vernacular photography, and found imagery. It's just crappy stuff that you can make into art ala Warhol. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And just so you guys can get an idea of what I'm designing, here's a sample: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
