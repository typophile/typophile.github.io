body: I&#39;m trying to reprint my ggfather books he wrote in 1890 and I would like
  to be as close to the original as possible. The biggest problem is with covers,
  where each line is in different font. The big ones I&#39;m cleaning pixel by pixel
  &#40;with mixed results&#41;. The small ones I would like to substitute with something
  close. I&#39;ve spend hours searching for replacements with no luck at all. Here
  goes the first one. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/55561.jpg"

  body: Thanks a lot!  <BR>I don&#39;t believe I will find Polish fonts, so that must
    be fixed manually.
