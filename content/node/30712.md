  is unique in that it has three thicknesses within the font, instead of the usual
  two (thick/thin).\r\n\r\nI have never been able to understand how this works. Can
  anyone explain to me where the three thicknesses are?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nJeremy\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ed_6358.png]"

  body: "It almost sounds like a trick question to me.\r\n\r\nMy best guess is the
    third width is in the tiny slab-like serifs. The other two would be the standard
    horizontal and vertical thicknesses.\r\n\r\nJust my guess. I'm probably wrong
    on it as I'm not an expert."

  body: BradB's guess is a good one. Another might be horizontals, verticals and curves
    (like that in the uc P).

  body: "I think a capital letter E can visualize it best.\r\nIt shows the three different
    thicknesses within the one letter -\r\nwhere most would only have two\r\n\r\nThis
    is only my educated guess at what Benguiat would be speaking of...\r\nSure you
    didn't have him confused with the three different speeds of an airplane? LOL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Korinna_5182.jpg]"
