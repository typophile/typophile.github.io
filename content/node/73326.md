body: In this image there are three different types of fonts. I'm mostly curious what
  the first and second fonts are. That is the fonts that make up "GENUINE" and "Ogallala".
  Any ideas? Most appreciated.

    Classic]] I believe is what this font <em>should</em> have been. However,\r\n@Florian
    Hardwig - I believe you are right in pointing out [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/madame/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DgG4eE3nNuUiInNeE3%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D23?refby=mfde|Madame]].
    Looking at a blown up version of the image I posted, the 'U' and the splits in
    the E's match [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/madame/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DgG4eE3nNuUiInNeE3%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D23?refby=mfde|Madame]]
    exactly.\r\n\r\n@NJMcLellan - That looks to be the font, just modified in height.
    Thanks for finding [[http://www.dafont.com/dream-orphans.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Ogallala|Dream
    Orphans]].\r\n\r\nLex, Florian, and NJ - Thank you very much for helping me!"
