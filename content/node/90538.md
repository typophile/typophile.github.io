body: I'd love to know the font used for Columbia Sportswear.  If anyone has any ideas,
  I'd greatly appreciate it.  I know it's gotta be some old style.

    logo (above) is probably custom-drawn to look Galliard-like (note the weird \u201Ca\u201D),
    but with beefed-up serifs. The \u201CTrying stuff\u201D tagline is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/dispatch/cond-bold/|Dispatch]]"

  body: Yeah, that "Galliard-esque" isn't very nice, but probably works better for
    embroidery on their clothes.
