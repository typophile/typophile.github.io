body: "Hi, can anyone point me to some online resources that will  help me with hinting?
  I want to know the specifics of the process for FontLab 5, since the Fontlab manual
  is not especially helpful to me. In particular, I want to know if\u2013when generating
  PS flavoured OT fonts\u2013there's anything I can do to adjust the hinting on individual
  glyphs. But I am also interested in the process of hinting for TT flavoured OT fonts\r\n\r\nI
  already know the basics, I am just finding it difficult to take the step with hinting
  towards a more professional approach than the Auto-settings in FontLab.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help you can offer.\r\n\r\nWayne, ATF.com.au"
