  come across one issue of which I am unsure.\r\n\r\nIt seems that there is quite
  a discrepancy between different typefaces with regards to italicizing different
  characters. Mathematical symbols, for example, are slanted in some faces and left
  unchanged in others. The same is true of some various punctuation symbols and other
  assorted glyphs.\r\n\r\nThis leads to my question: is there a preferred method for
  dealing with these characters in italics? If not, I'm curious to hear people's opinions
  on the matter."

    I figure that if their customers are happy with it than most people will be.\r\n\r\nI
    understand why some people leave math operators upright, especially in display
    faces, because nobody is ever going to use them anyway. I do slant them, but I
    also leave out the extra stuff from Mac OS Roman because nobody uses it anyway."

    thought the point is more that when you actually typeset mathematical formulas
    you don't want slanted operators, you need upright ones (even though variables
    etc. may be italicized). Which would imply that upright ones might also be useful
    in a text face.\r\nHowever things like the \"+\" can't only be used for actual
    math stuff but also as a typographic device, in which case you probably want it
    to match the angle of the italic. So basically it comes down to what you expect
    people to use your math operators for. And if you want to be extra generous you
    just give them both slanted and upright ones."

  body: "Many mathematical symbols are such that when a vertical stroke is replaced
    with a slanted one, it starts to look like it could be a different symbol. The
    information of \"this is definitely supposed to be a vertical line\" or \"this
    is definitely supposed to be a diagonal line\" needs to be preserved for clarity.
    Also, variables are usually italic letters, and it takes some of the hassle out
    of setting equations when you don't have to worry about an ugly sloped plus sneaking
    in.\r\n\r\nWhen I think there might be some value in the italic being distinct
    from the roman, I skew the ends of the horizontal strokes."

  body: "Thank you all for the advice and insight. I've decided to un-italicize my
    mathematical operators.\r\n\r\nNina, I might take up your comment about including
    both (one for mathematical formulas and one for display).\r\n\r\nWhat are everyone's
    thoughts of italicized diacritics? At the moment, I've decided to leave the acute
    and the grave at the same slant they are in the Roman for the sake of clarity."

    would do likewise.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThere is some cultural history and tradition
    here.\r\nFolllowing that, it would seem to be more appropriate to have non-slanted
    non-alphabetic glyphs in old-style faces.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I made
    all the italic math operators in my 19th century revival, the Modern Suite fonts,
    slanted.\r\nThe reason being, that even with its copious language coverage, they
    are still not math fonts.\r\n\r\nIMO, unless one is producing a fully loaded math
    font, all italic glyphs should be slanted, except \xAE and \xA9.\r\n\r\n(I did
    provide vertical parentheses in the Mod Suite italics, as a Stylistic Set.)"

  body: "I presume the reason for excluding \xAE and \xA9 is to meet legal requirements.\r\n\r\nA
    \"really old-school revival\", indeed, might note that only very basic punctuation
    characters belonged to individual fonts, and most other special symbols were sorts.
    Thus, & and $ might be italicized, but @, #, and % would not be. The obvious reason
    for not doing it that way is that so doing would be foregoing an advantage the
    new technology gives us for no good reason.\r\n\r\nEven when one isn't doing a
    typeface specifically intended for mathematics, though, italicizing |, +, =, ~,
    <, and > does present potential ambiguities. While I would tend to agree this
    is not an issue with display typefaces, almost any <em>text</em> typeface, these
    days, could be used, if not for mathematics, at least for programming examples.
    (But here, italics aren't an issue, unless the original Pascal display format
    is being used...)\r\n\r\nHowever, it's always possible for those preparing a text
    to only italicize the variable names, so this is not a critical issue."
