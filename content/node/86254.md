  board in this website and would very much like to use it in my paper i am working
  on for schoool, but i can't seem to find the author. if this looks like your writing,
  would you mind if i quoted you in my paper. it works perfectly for \"what not to
  do\" (ethically) in design, it is a great example. i would like to give credit in
  my paper to the person who wrote it.\r\n\r\n\"Designers can play a huge role in
  society; most don't. Those designing for products that have a massive impact on
  the lives of people around the world, or those who get into the world of politics\u2014which
  they often don't now, as the 24-hour news cycle has wiped out the time needed to
  work good design into politics\u2014have to be careful about the ethical lines they
  might be crossing; I believe that most designers are doing quite well when it comes
  to ethical decision making. I think that this is in large part due to the glaring
  examples of what happens when designers go bad that we have left over from the twentieth
  century: all the great designers who worked tirelessly designing propaganda for
  the Nazi and Communist parties which then committed unconscionable acts against
  humanity that overshadow all other great evils of history.\"\r\n\r\nThanks tons,\r\nSaveGirl101"
