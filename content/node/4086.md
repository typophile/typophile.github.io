  Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice and 21st Century Potential&#39; &#40;the
  book presents nonviolent action as a powerful and effective means to wage conflict&#41;.
  Many book covers of a similar genre prefer to use typography rather than a graphical
  image to convey the message. However, I&#39;m not sure whether the choice of fonts
  have been accidental. I want a font that conveys power and conflict. Any suggestions
  and justifications for use would be greatly appreciated...'

  body: A &#34;font that conveys power and conflict&#34; might be inappropriate &#40;your
    strategy is off if it fits Walking Tall&#41;. However, Rian Hughes&#39; FLAK would
    look good in pink camo.

  body: K, I would suggest you begin with sketches. Maybe you can find a photo or
    design that would be appropriate. Then experiment with different faces superimposed
    on the images. Be careful about putting the cart before the horse. That doesn&#39;t
    work. Suppose we say Gill Sans Bold. How will your copy break? That&#39;s crucial
    to comprehension. But where will the copy be in relation to the elements in the
    photo, design, illo, whatever? Nail down your imagery first, then think about
    typefaces. They are interconnected and one size doesn&#39;t fit all.

  body: Type can BE the illustration, too. Paul is right. It would be cool to see
    your sketches/ideas. We could comment on those. Despite my type-loving nature,
    I think that I agree that the typeface selection is not the <i>first</i> question
    that someone should ask when they begin a project like this one. <BR> <BR>Some
    designers think that there are only a handfull of faces that anyone should ever
    use. Thankfully, I don&#39;t think that any of them are frequent visitors here.
    &#40;Although, it would be tremendous fun to spar with them!&#41;

  body: Dan -- Obviously I would not limit myself to never using a new face should
    an occasion arise, but I think an argument can be made that a proliferation of
    bad faces now created digitally makes more trouble for designers than it helps
    them. There&#39;s a whole other dimension to typographic design which has to do
    with how a line of copy is set for comprehension as well as aesthetics. Do your
    instructors at the school get into that?

  body: K, I really like example number 6. I think that your text and illustration
    are the most integrated there. Plus, I really like your arrows on that page. I&#39;ve
    been drawing alot of vector arrows myself lately, but your approach is something
    I hadn&#39;t thought of.

  body: K- <BR> <BR>Have you looked for some images of actual nonviolent protests?
    <BR>There are many famous struggles that have been waged in such a way during
    the 20th century.  The added phsycological connection of such a picture to the
    subconcious would perhaps add some emotional punch and validity.  I am thinking
    something with the faces of the protesters.... <BR>examples in a moment... <BR>

    Impact is a poor choice for most things &#40;as is Corbis, but that&#39;s another

  body: I really like that first photo &#40;what is it of&#41;? <BR> <BR>Actually
    my initial brief came with the request for the use of the Tienanmen Square photo,
    as this is one of 23 diverse case studies from the last century &#40;ranging from
    Russia in 1905, to Guatemala in 1944, the Philippines in 1986, to Serbia in 2000&#41;
    used in the book. There has been some internal debate as to whether T. Sq is the
    best example of nonviolent struggle...not to mention acquiring photographic rights.  <BR>
    <BR>My concern with using a single photograph is that it becomes too focused on
    one event rather than capturing the overall proactive &#39;emotions&#39; or &#39;strategies&#39;.
    Hence the reason for some of the simpler graphics which are more open to interpretation
    &#40;but at the risk of being boring!&#41;. <BR> <BR>

  body: I think that the images in your mock-ups all look rather violent or scary.  <BR>
    <BR>Anyway - Besides stock imagery - you can probably acquire images from your
    newspapers - which will have tons of protests and union marches archived as they
    happened on that day in history in that city - you can search them in the periodicals
    at the library first. <BR> <BR>As for the typography it might be suitable to have
    the cover mimic a protest sign - rather then a book cover.  Condensed fonts like
    Trade Gothic&#39;s remind me of signs, but that might just be me.
