<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello Everyone!
I'd like some help with typeface suggestions to accompany a corporate mark in a signature lockup. The mark should be able to stand on its own, as should the logotype—depending on later applications. The accompanying image shows two possible explorations, among others (to show an aesthetic direction), yet to be further refined.
This is a start-up company called "Pulse"—they're a logistics firm involved in international/global trade.
We're (with the client) leaning toward all caps, as I've found that upper and lower case with the letters "Pu" just makes for an awkward pairing. The more I look at various faces, the more confused I get. Should it be chunky like an Inserat, or elegantly rounded like Futura, squarish like a Eurostile, or condensed/compacted?
Much appreciated,
Andrew

<div class=commentbody>I'd try to use a square typeface, and the width and finish of its strokes should be clearly related to the forms you use in the mark. This will give a family likeness to the mark and logotype and ensure that people recognise them as belonging to the same firm even when they're used separately.
Instead of looking for a readymade typeface, you could draw those five letters yourself -- which would give you full control over their relationship to the logo and allow you to make sure that although being square and solid, they don't look too static -- after all, it's a firm that moves things around.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Phillips points are good ones...I just have one other suggestion. You could hire a third party to make the cusom letters for you. That's one of thes services I and some others on the board provide. The great thing about custom lettering is that the clunkiness of the PU ( or other letter combos ) can be dealt with optimally.</div>
