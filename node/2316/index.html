		<div class="commentbody">I agree, David. I think people forget that design is meant to be the bridge between message and audience. It is meant to craft the medium in an effort to facilitate or focus understanding. By putting design ahead of the message (such is the case with the &quot;typop&quot; submissions as well as many others) meaning is essentially subverted. In these instances we're really talking about decoration and not design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you guys are analyzing this too much. For what reason, I'm not sure. <BR> <BR>Typop is just a clever shortening of typophile, and the 'Pop' part finds echoes in Pop Culture, Sub Pop records (nirvana's original label), Yum Pop clothing (hypercute japanese flava), and of course, Pop Tarts breakfast treats. Pop is just a cool word. It pops. <BR> <BR>These are Tshirts, c'mon now. <BR> <BR>People aren't going to see a shirt with a website address printed on it and sprint to their browsers. We have a highly specialized auidence What this is more about is finding a Tshirt that *we* will REALLY ACTUALLY BUY, something we wouldn't be ashamed to wear because it is, for lack of a better word, cool. BUYING the judge's choice helps ensure that typophile is still here in five years. <BR> <BR>My favorite so far is 18.008/ and I like Typop, but if I was submitting it to this contest, I'd flip the 'o' and lose the little boy icon in favor of something more typographic &ndash; remember *who* is judging. I think they are all over 30. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>Also, Jared/Joe, the contestants need to know how revisions and variations are viewed by the judges. Could Typop variations and revisions have the effect of splitting his own votes? (I'm assuming 'he' because I saw the little boy icon on his website a while back.) <BR> <BR>Are the revisions 'swapped out' for the originals when it's time to judge? <BR> <BR>Are the judges under the impression that Tshirt colors are flexible, thus picking the *design* they like best, regardless of Tshirt color and design colorway? <BR> <BR>bj</div>

		<div class="commentbody">yes, Alterpop.com.! You guys have a nice site. <BR> <BR>Well, with a couple of exceptions, Tshirts are always made to be sold. That is the case here. A person wearing a Tshirt is a 'walking billboard' but if I mention Typophile to someone (friend, wife, etc.) they are like, huh? <BR> <BR>Not that Typop will win or won't win, but that kind of shirt will get worn with more frequency than another &ndash; possibly. And thus, promote Typophile well. <BR> <BR>Also, a shirt like El Typophile, which shows some nice craft, might not sell as well to US TYPOPHILES as something more 'pop'. <BR> <BR>So hopefully the judges choice will represent a balance of typopgraphic faithfulness and coolness, or pop.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey guys and gals. <BR>I was one of those dot com casualties. I thought I was going with a good thing and now I'm doing side work to stay afloat. I am working on several designs for this competition. I hope to win like everyone else. The money could come in handy too. <BR>I disagree with Tim Lee who said whoever wins is not that important. Why should some one enter this competition. I saw all the designs. Some people don't care it seems if they win or lose. I would have put the names on thse inital posts. That way you would have more quality over quantity. People wouldnt put their name on some of the designs. I dont exactly know how to capture the essence of typophile. Its a forum to discuss type and design. There are a lot of those on the internet. I'm unsure about what the judges are looking for. Some of them are type designers so the type should be topnotch. NOt Arial or Times. I agree with Joe Pemberton that putting a dot com on a shirt (like <a href="http://www.dotcom.com">www.dotcom.com</a>) is so &quot;three years ago&quot; Every one three years ago was proudly wearing their dot bomb shirts on casual Fridays and weekends. It was a big joke if you ask me. People walking into the grocery store wearing their dot bomb shirts. It was like showing off. Now you wouldnt be caught dead wearing a dot bomb shirt. As for people visiting the site. I don't think non-designers give a whip. But every designer should at least stop by. That would be my target demographic. Especially a lot of these web designers who track Arial or Helvetica tight and think that is design. Then if you are at a party with other web designers then I would wear it. If it was a party with the regular population I wouldn't wear it. I think if the winning design is reeeeeely good then people would approach and say nice shirt buddy but I dont think theyd pull out a pen and write down <a href="http://www.typophile.com">www.typophile.com</a> and then get home and check it out first thing. Thats a stretch. I think peoplemake fun of any shirt now that says <a href="http://www.something.com">www.something.com</a>. Do I haaaaave to do that  I look foward to seeing my designs posted. It seems like theres a huge backlog. <BR> <BR>ciao, <BR> <BR>dave</div>
