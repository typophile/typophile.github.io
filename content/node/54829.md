  body: There are a lot of irregularities in the letter construction and proportions.
    I think it's likely this was from a hand-painted sign or something similar.

  body: "I had to copy the image and shrink it to about 10% to see what you meant,
    but I agree that it seems hand-drawn. The N's are different widths and the R's
    have different tails. Except for the A, which looks like some Caslon's, I would
    say the lettering seems based on a heavy weight of Century.\r\n\r\nHey Mark, did
    you decide to scour the old threads for ones that were never solved? I see a flock
    of posts like this. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
