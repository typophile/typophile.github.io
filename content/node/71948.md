  grid?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot guys!\r\n\r\n\u2013B\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    corresponds to the point size of the font. The caps height and the x-height are
    normally fractions of the UPM size (that is, the point size). Typically, the caps
    height of a text font is about 70% of the UPM size, so that the flat uppercase
    letters such as E, when set at 10 pt, will be around 7 pt tall. \r\n\r\nBy default
    the UPM size is 1000 units but it can be anything between 16 and 32,000 (with
    extremely small or extremely large UPM sizes, you may find that FontLab Studio
    works a bit strange when it comes to zooming).  \r\n\r\nSo let's say you want
    your x-height to be 12 grid squares tall, and that the x-height should be 60%
    of the desired point size. This means that your point size (UPM size) will correspond
    to 12/0.6=20 grid squares. Now you could decide to stick to the standard UPM size
    (1000 units) and set the grid step to 1000/20=50 units, or you could pick any
    UPM size that is divisible by your number of grid squares that make out the point
    size. So you could use the UPM size of 500 and make the grid step 25, or use the
    UPM size of 200 and make the grid step to be 10. \r\n\r\nIf you find out that
    the point size should correspond to, say, 17 grid squares, you need to set the
    UPM size to be easily divisible by that number, 17. So it could be 170 at the
    grid step of 10, or 340 at the grid step of 20, or you could make the grid step
    50 and the UPM size 850 (to keep it fairly close to the default UPM size of 1000).
    \r\n\r\nThe reasons for sticking close to 1000, and discussion about the maximum
    and minimum sizes and their repercussions can be found at http://typophile.com/node/30913\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n\r\n"
