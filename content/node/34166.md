body: Could anyone direct me to information about the pre-1989 street signage typeface
  used in East Berlin. I know there is a FF face based on the street signage but can
  any one tell me the name/name of the designer of the original? Any help would be
  greatly appreciated. Thank you.

    The weights with \xBBEast\xAB in their names are the ones you are asking for."
