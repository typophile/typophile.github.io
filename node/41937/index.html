<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>First post so if this is in the wrong place i apologize in advance.
I have always been interested in trying to understand ways of communicating via Typeface. I dont just mean what the letters spell or represent but showing a bigger picture through just letters.
For instance many fonts used for Business's are straight forward,blank and to the point. Nothing fancy. Where as others depend upon somthing to stand out and catch the eye of the public. Now to my understanding this can be achieved through many ways. Colour,Placement,Size also the font itself.
But what im asking is to you. "The others" of my kind.
When you see a typeface on a anything, any sort of product how does that particuler font represnt the product/company.
Sorry if this is confusing also im trying to gain as much knowledge of the Design Industry as possible to further my career.

<div class=commentbody>Jack, it does seem slightly confusing :)
Do take a look at [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezyRovNSaHs|this film]] if that's the sort of information you're looking for.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You had some of your answers in your questions.

That is because their goal is to communicate.

And these uses are trying to attract attention. Normally this will only be a heading, or a few words. Many of this type of font would be difficult to read if an entire book was printed in them. The features that make them stand out usually lessen their ability to communicate.
Another type of font is less flashy, but might convey other moods. Comic Sans (for those who do not hate it) is considered less formal, and provides a more casual feel. An ornate script face is more dignified and a Blackletter is even more so. The former gets a lot of use with wedding invitations, and the latter is used in funeral cars and some newspaper nameplates (New York and London Times, for instance). And when you get good at it, you will start to develop a feel for other fonts, and what uses they might be nice for.</div>
