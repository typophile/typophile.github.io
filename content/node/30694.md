body: Hi everyone. I am a bit confused, I am sure this font is called commecial script
  but I can not find it on any font site to buy. Any ideas if it is called a different
  name or where I can get it? Really appreciate your time.

    looks like a European school child's handwriting...\r\n\r\nHope someone knows

  body: For the record, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=BT.107516.0.0">this</a>
    is Commercial Script.  I don't quite know how Dafont has another font by the same
    name. But by the quality I should have guessed it was a freebie.
