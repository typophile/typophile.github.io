  (see my previous post). \r\n\r\nThe client requested one direction to be particularly
  clean, modern, no gimmicks. Much like [[http://www.vertu.com/]], [[https://www.flyvictor.com/]]
  or [[http://www.bang-olufsen.com]]. \r\n\r\nAttached, two superposed versions. How
  does Frutiger hold up?  Knul in small caps looks a bit too playful to me, however
  it really works here  [[https://www.blackjet.com/]]"

  body: JL, is it possible to drop "yachts" and just work with "Mera"? Notice that
    Victor isn't "Victor Jets", Vertu isn't "Vertu Phones", Bang & Olufsen isn't "Bang
    & Olufsen Audio".

  body: "You're right, Captain. I've considered dropping \"yachts\" (still do), then
    moved in another direction as I felt I was lacking \"substance\" just with the
    letters M-E-R-A. But then, it would be more memorable to integrate the idea of
    \"more\" or \"beyond\" into the logo, instead. \r\n\r\nSimplifying to one word,
    I believe the version using slab serif \"Vitesse\" would work well. Simple, solid,
    confident. Like Hermes, [[http://www.hermes.com/]]. Only disadvantage is one competitor
    using it already (not for their logo, though, but for headlines on their website).
    FF DIN could work as well, but less unique. \r\n\r\nExploring a \"handwritten\"
    version was suggested by the client, inspired by the Bmw GranLusso logo. But I'll
    advise them not to proceed in this direction. It's out of context. \r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mera2_5710.jpg]"

  body: "Dropping \"yachts\" seems like a good idea. The photography & marketing will
    communicate what the product is.\r\n\r\nNot sure about \"If you can build yachts,
    why sit on the beach?\" I'd assume that people buying a yacht are already into
    boating."

  body: "Personally I don't think I would choose a slab serif font; somehowdoesn't
    feel luxurious enough. The scriptish font (Mera Yachts) looks like it belongs
    on an outboard motor or a fishing reel. I don't think all lower caps is best for
    conveying luxury.\r\n\r\nI like the one in the bottom right corner best, but with
    only four letters you could also do a custom design. You're not limited to pre-designed
    fonts. If I were doing this, I would explore the resemblance of the M to a trident.
    (I would expect \"Mera\" will make most people think of \"mer\" sooner than \"mehr\".)
    Or I would remove the crossbar from the A and make the M look like two A's stuck
    together.\r\n\r\nAgree with JamesM. \"If you can build yachts, why buy one from
    us?\""

  body: "Thank you for your opinion, gentlemen. Brandon or Futura, bottom right, will
    be one of the versions. The trident is a nice idea, but I'd rather keep the concept
    more minimal. The crossbarless A is an option, though. I dropped the idea of using
    the slab serif (Vitesse) also because of a competitor using it extensively. It's
    uncommon for a premium brand, so you notice it even better. As for that sentence,
    I guess you're both right!\r\n\r\n"
