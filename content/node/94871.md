  body: "You pose an interesting question.\r\n\r\nIf the band itself is a hackneyed
    clich\xE9, then a clich\xE9 solution seems appropriate. Music for simple-minded
    people=logo for dummies.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the ladies are creative,
    inventive and somewhat \"ahead of the curve,\" then you have your work cut out
    for you.\r\n\r\nDo something surprising; do something unexpected. Hell\u2026even
    Comic Sans can be used to great effect if you have the \"serious irony\" thing
    going\u2014and can convince people that \r\n\r\nThink in the box; think outside
    the box; or think WAY, WAY outside the box. Amaze yourself, and amaze everyone
    else in the process.\r\n\r\nIMHO\u2026"
