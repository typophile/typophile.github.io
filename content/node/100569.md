    a lot of work with Funk/Rock rhythms and thick, interwoven vocal harmony.\r\n\r\n<strong>Products:</strong>
    Visual identity. Logo. Business cards. Posters. Album art. Liner notes. Brochures.
    Bumper stickers. Newsletters. Probably even t-shirts, down the line.\r\n\r\nIs
    that enough, or do you need the brand messages that we're hoping to reinforce
    with these typefaces? I mean, if these two faces flat-out don't work together,
    then describing the brand messages to you might be an unproductive use of my time.
    What do you see in it?"

    up on the weight but then you might achieve the same effect using a regular and
    book weight of the same typeface.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: The Metro-ish sans is slightly too dark in color (eg too fat) & the x-heights
    could be more equal (the slight variation there is currently is distracting too
    much).

  body: "So far, people aren't bothered by a stylistic mismatch -- just the proportions?\r\n\r\nI
    was trying to split the difference between matching the x-height and matching
    the cap-height. The sans I'm trying here has an x-height that is much smaller
    than the serif's.\r\n\r\nThis sans I'm trying has a wide variety of weights; the
    serif I'm using has none. I used the one that looked a little darker b/c I thought,
    in this example, that it could stand for STRONG or BOLD.\r\n\r\nBut you confirm
    my fears: the vertical proportions are just a little bit too far off. I haven't
    yet found a sans in this genre that matches like I'd like; this is the closest
    I've gotten. \r\n\r\nAnybody know how I can get in touch with Wolfgang Homola?
    The other candidate was http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/soleil/ ,  but
    I would be interested in customizations.\r\n"
