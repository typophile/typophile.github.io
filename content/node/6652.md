body: Hi, great website, can anyone help us out? <BR> <BR>We have come across the
  font; <BR> <BR>ITC Lubalin Graph BT <BR> <BR>And we would like to use it, but we
  think that we have seen it somewhere else - and it is driving us crazy. Does anyone
  else recall it? It reminds of some fast food restuaruant... <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR>

  body: It&#39;s a well established typeface that&#39;s been around for quite awhile.
    I&#39;m sure if you look hard enough you&#39;ll find lots of logos in lots of
    industries using it.

  body: seems more scary to me that burger king and the golden corral NEED websites
    like that....interactive cheeseburgers, double click on fries.....i think it&#39;s
    time people got outdoors and experienced something other than the sensation of
    meat slapping the back of their throat....just a thought..
