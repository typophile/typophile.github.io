  body: Kodachrome was indeed king. I spent several years in the audiovisual business,
    preparing multi-screen, multi-projector slide shows (yet ANOTHER skill/profession
    that I once practiced that has vanished). For the vast majority of our work (graphics),
    we always used Ektachrome slide film because it was cheaper and faster/easier
    to process, and we could easily correct for the distinctly bluish cast the film
    had. But, for the money shots (people and products), we always used Kodachrome,
    because of its brilliant (and much truer) color rendition.

  body: What killed me about Kodachrome from that article was, it was ASA 25. How
    slow can you go.

  body: I still like the way Kodachrome looks slightly 3-D in a slide viewer, when
    you look with both eyes, and are aware that red flowers, say, are closer than
    green leaves, due to the layering of the dye layers.

  body: Nick cool point. I wish they still offered it. I'd like to shoot a roll with
    my Zero Pinhole Camera.

    and 200 ISO.

  body: 'J. I was just refering to what was written in the article. I''d love to shoot
    a super slow film (in color) using my Pinhole camera. I have a 2 second exposure
    with 400 ASA film in bright sunlight. I currently use Fuji Superia ASA 100 and
    its about a 5 second exposure in birght sunlight. '

  body: "The Kodachrome 25 ASA slides I shot 40 years ago are stiil saturated and
    clear.  Any of the E6 films suffer shifts and fades.  I will admit that the Type
    50 stuff still looks pretty damn good too.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
