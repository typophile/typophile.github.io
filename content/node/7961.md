  body: Angel, post this at the Type Idenification Board and please include an image
    in jpg format. Edit it to just the type you want to ID but don&#39;t make the
    sample too small.

  body: The Details logo is set in September, by Hubert Jocham, which the magazine
    also uses for text and display. The magazine&#39;s serif face is Enigma, by Jeremy
    Tankard. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.hubertjocham.de/" target="_blank">http://www.hubertjocham.de/</a>

    <BR> <BR>&#40;Thanks to Ole Sorensen, who first pointed me to Mr. Jocham&#39;s
    work a couple years ago when I was a Typophile newbie!&#41;

  body: 'Angel <BR> <BR>The typface used by Details is called &#34;September&#34;
    and is currently exclusive for the magazine. There might be a solution for you
    though. Details have been one of my regular magazines for many years and I was
    slightly inspired by  September during my process of making &#34;Sophisto&#34;.
