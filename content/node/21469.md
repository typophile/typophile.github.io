  house font, but I've seen it recently in non-condom situations such as on food packaging!\r\n\r\nIs
  it a corporate-only font that's been made available to the wider market?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: Actually, FF Cocon is the perfect choice for Durex, both linguistically as
    stylistically. Nice one... :^)
