  body: "No worries, I'm not angry. It's a very sensitive subject around here. There
    are a lot of type designers that feel piracy and similar practices have destroyed
    a once strong industry. Mentioning an act of copying work would be considered
    along those lines and it's frowned at here. We're here to teach and inform people
    of the beautiful world that typography is. And how to enjoy using it without resorting
    to pilfering it. If you want to learn more about type, you've come to the right
    place. \r\n\r\nAs for your dilemma, I can only suggest purchasing a version of
    Avant Garde that has alternatives. You'll need a program like Illustrator or InDesign
    with a glyphs palette (found under windows> type> glyphs). There you'll find the
    alternative A you are desperate to use. There should be several other alternatives
    to there letters there as well.\r\n\r\n"

    I don't want to start a fight here, but I don't think Jorge (TweakingKnobs) is
    planning to trace the entire Avant Garde character set to make a pirate font and
    pass it off (or sell it) as his own work. That <em>would</em> be unethical and
    illegal, but if I understand correctly Jorge just needs to modify a few letters
    for a job he's working on. Designers tweak and modify letters all the time when
    creating logos, for example, and that's no crime. "

    that certainly is a sensitive topic, knowing that there are foundries that don't
    allow their fonts to be embedded in PDFs."
