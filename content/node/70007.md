  shows a bold sans serif on the left, and a grid fitted version of the same typeface
  on the right. The latter is adjusted so that every stem lands on a whole pixel when
  displayed at 8px size. (One pixel = 125 units)\r\n\r\nBelow, I\u2019ve attached
  an image showing the rendering in OSX and Windows.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ff_vs_chrome_5228.png]\r\n\r\nAt
  these sizes you have very little control over spacing and the shapes will look crude
  if the web user for some reason decides to resize the text. However, I can imagine
  designing for a bigger size might work quite well. You\u2019ll get improved rendering
  at the intended  size, and with hinting you won\u2019t lose much compared to other
  fonts if the user zooms in or out."

    for the given size, while on the web not even specifying in px will assure the
    font will be used at that size. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    blow up those small versions of Gill Sans? Anyway: Designing for one intended
    pixel size (and hint for the rest) is better than designing for print and using
    it on screen."

  body: Frank, does your font contain any hints? It shouldn't, but I'm wondering about
    the different rendering of the ear of the g, whether this is due to Apple's rendering
    engine applying antialiasing in both directions while Windows only applies in
    one direction, or whether this is being affected by hints (possibly autohints
    during font generation?)?

  body: "@John: I\u2019m also wondering about that ear. I don\u2019t know the first
    thing about hinting. (I really should, though!) Unless Fontlab does something
    on it\u2019s own when I export, there are no hints.\r\n\r\n@David: I\u2019m guessing
    your stems doesn\u2019t add up to whole pixels, but they are centered on a pixel.
    Likewise, I\u2019m guessing all glyph widths (with sidebearings) adds up to the
    nearest pixel value. Am I right?"

  body: Frank, in FontLab's TrueType/OpenType generate options, there is an option
    to 'Autohint unhinted glyphs'. You should see whether this is checked; if it is,
    then FontLab will have first applied its PS autohinting and then converted these
    hints to TT instructions. For your purposes, you probably want to turn this option
    off.
