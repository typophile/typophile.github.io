body: "I was identifying a typeface, which I did, as Bickham Script. However though,
  as I went to MyFonts to testdrive it, I could notice that the one letter \"l\" there
  didn't correspond to that found at Identifont (and which is also the one to match
  my sample); i.e. <a href=http://www.identifont.com/find?font=bickham+script&q=Go>Identifont's</a>
  \"l\" has a loop, whereas <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bickham-script/regular/>MyFonts'
  (Linotype's)</a> doesn't.\r\n\r\nAt first thought, I wondered whether that might
  eventually come from the fact that Identifont's Bickham Script was Pro, while MyFonts'
  wasn't said to be (thus I wondered whether those might eventually be two different
  \"versions\"). But as I could check at the other font vendors referenced at Identifont,
  everywhere Bickham Script Pro does actually have the loopless \"l\" (including at
  Adobe).\r\n\r\nThen again, however, at both <a href=http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/font/pid/408351/Bickham+Script+MM/detail>ITC</a>
  and <a href=http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=408351>fonts.com</a> is
  found this other \"version\" of Bickham Script, Bickham Script MM (Multiple Master),
  and which in turn does indeed have the \"l\" with the loop.\r\n\r\n(Checking back
  at <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bickham-script-mm/>MyFonts for Bickham
  Script MM</a>, though, which is referenced there to be the original font which the
  actual Bickham Script is based on, the displayed \"l\" is again loopless. I take
  it, though, that this is possibly because the \"sample font set\" they have at MyFonts
  for testdriving Adobe's Bickham Script MM is probably the same as they have for
  Linotype's Bickham Script, no?...)      \r\n\r\nSo, after all the puzzling info
  found, I thought I'd ask for further enlightenment here, please?... :-) (Just hope
  it's alright to ask this here, in this section of the forum?... Since this is not
  exactly a type ID request... :-S) I wonder then, the \"l\" with the loop, in which
  \"version(s)\" of Bickham Script is that supposed to be found, in the end? MM only?
  And what then does this \"Multiple Master\" stand for, I also wonder?... (Would
  that be in some form a previous/preliminary version of Bickham Script, then, and
  from which today's version derives, to which the \"l\" has been changed to become
  loopless, would that be something like it?...)\r\n\r\nThank you once more. :-)"

  body: "I don't know about the MM version, but Bickham Script Pro, the latest incarnation
    of Bickham Script has 20+ alternates of the lowercase 'l'. The default form is
    indeed the one without the loop. The variant forms are either contextually inserted
    (if the OpenType \"Contextual Alternates\" feature is active), or can be manually
    inserted through the Glyph palette (which is available in a few applications).
    A sample of 'l's follows:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bickham_l_4134.png]"

    it goes: the default 'l' form in Bickham Script MM (1997) is the one on the left,
    and the one on the right is the default form in Bickham Script Std (1999) and
    Bickham Script Pro (2004).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bickham_l_mm_std_pro_4571.png]"

  body: "Thank you for all replies.\r\n\r\nStrangely, that other thread referred by
    antiuser didn't come up, as running a preliminary search for Bickham Script...
    (Still doesn't either... Hmm...) Would I have guessed that the Bickham Script
    lower case \"l\" \"issue\" had just been brought up just a handful of days ago...
    :-P\r\n\r\nThen again, yes, I had also been through Adobe's Glyph Complement PDF
    for Bickham Script Pro. And yes, so I could see that it does have various alternates,
    not only of the \"l\", as well as of most of the other characters too (amazing
    in fact, the extensive variety). (And so that was in the end my \"answer\" all
    along: \"simply\" alternates. :-P To be honest, though, my thought then was that
    each of those alternate sets were part of their own individual font files, i.e.
    the alternates set, the beginnings set, the endings set, etc, each would come
    in their own individual font file in separate...) I got indeed only wondering
    whether eventually there was any particular/previous version of Bickham Script,
    in which the \"l\" with the loop was the default, for which why I wondered also
    about that MM \"version\" of it...\r\n\r\nThank you, still, to everyone, for all
    additional explanations; most appreciated, thank you indeed! :-)\r\n\r\n<em>P.S.
    Ooops, I made a short edit to this post of mine from yesterday, and now notice
    it was moved up to \"front in line\". I'm so sorry for that, I wasn't aware that
    editing a post would cause its order to be altered in the posts sequence. :-S
    This does end up making the thread a bit confusing, now, I'm sorry again. :-S
    (This post of mine was originally in between Miguel Sousa's second and third posts,
    respectively from Aug. 16 and 18, i.e. previous to the one in which he displays
    the default \"l\" in Bickham Script MM and that in Bickham Scripts Std and Pro;
    please consider so, when reading this thread. And thank you for your best comprehension.)</em>"
