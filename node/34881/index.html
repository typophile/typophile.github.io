I like the ones by Albertoni and Hornus the most.

Two things:
1) Would you say that Greek "natives"
are less interested in making text fonts?
2) Why were the new MS fonts not included
among the "out of competition" selections?

BTW, when Michail Semoglou's text is
published in English please let us know!

2) The MS - out of competition typefaces that were left out are the well-known Candara, Cambria, Calibri, Constantia, Corbel and Segoe. I have just added the not so well-known ones, namely Segoe Script and Segoe Print (MS), Convection (MS) and New Johnston (Monotype Imaging).

As for Greek native speakers and text faces, I suppose this is no different than elsewhere, where display fonts are more popular. Added to this, any serious text Greek face would need to have Latin, making it even more work. Maybe.</div>

It depends on how you define "serious"...

Plus when you think about how Latin and Greek typically need to harmonize, all you might need to do is match the color (and maybe the apparent size) of some existing Latin text face and you'd pretty much be there without the effort of making your own Latin.

		<div class="commentbody">Certainly Latin is the lingua franca of writing systems*, and it's useful to support it as much as possible. But the extent to which non-Latin fonts are made to "harmonize" with (more like "enslaved to") Latin is uncalled for, and in fact generally dysfunctional. When we think of "matching", let's not mean a full replication of formal features, like stroke terminals, vertical proportions, etc. Let's instead start from a lucid evaluation of how readers actually use multi-script documents, and try to see which letterform macro and micro features actually help foster a real, deep harmony, and which in fact consititute a formulaic, shallow, rote transplantation.

John, I can't find it now, but I remember seeing a sample of an early version of your SBL Greek somewhere, and it was really beautiful. I'm certainly looking forward to the release. You can probably find traces of some of its features in my own attempt at Greek, <a href="http://typophile.com/node/34520">Naxia</a>, still in its earliest stages. (The influence is clearer in the italic, though you'll have to take my word for it as it is not quite ready to be presented yet...)

I too am disappointed in the shortage of entries by Greek designers, especially in the text face category. Still, I expect good things to come out of the infusion of new ideas by the latest generation of Greek type designers studying abroad. I also hope that it becomes easier to get formal training for type design in Greece so that budding type designers are not all forced to go abroad to learn their trade.

I'd agree the only thing worse than everyone using Simplified Chinese would be everyone using English. 

However I think the future looks brighter for minority writing systems thanks to the work of people like SIL, and dare I say it my company. You can't force people not to use English, but give them high-quality tools to create and consume content in their native language out-of-the-box and at least they have that option*.

		<div class="commentbody">So we go off topic...

Remember we're talking about scripts, not languages. The Chinese script is only workable for Sinitic languages. At least the boring Latin script, being alphabetic, can readily serve a wide variety of languages. That is one reason for its wide-spread use long after Latin ceased to be spoken widely.

Before the Korean alphabet was invented, being literate in Korea meant having to learn a whole different language, i.e. Classical Chinese. The literate elite were secure in their monopoly of knowledge and control of society due to the many years of schooling necessary to learn Classical Chinese. There is no way to readily adapt the Chinese ideographs to writing any other language. If the Chinese script becomes the lingua franca, it can only mean that the Chinese language itself has become the global tongue.

At least with the current dominance of the Latin script, the individual languages are not threatened. On the contrary, we have examples like the Latinization campaigns in the Soviet Union that were aimed at improving the status of minority languages though the introduction of the Latin script to write them down.

I am all for language and script diversity. A Latin-dominated landscape does not preclude language diversity, but a Chinese-script-dominated one does. That's why I call such a future dark and bleak. All this is not to mention the problem the Chinese have with their own script with the thousands of characters. I'm sorry, but preferring a future dominated by the Chinese script to the status quo is hopelessly naïve.</div>

Just like I don't think literal Latinization is good, I wouldn't want to see Chinese have an explicit influence on any other script. But it does have under-appreciated and under-used merits that can serve as superb inspiration. One of them is that it's not an alphabet!

Which it will be. And I see nothing wrong with that (as long as a lingua franca is inevitable). But more importantly, I don't agree with your blindered view. Humans are much more creative than that. In fact AFAIK there are Chinese-derived systems for encoding non-Chinese languages out there already.

I have to start thinking that you have a personal thing against China.

Every system has problems. And quite clearly the "problem" with
Chinese isn't great enough to prevent them from taking over...

> script to the status quo is hopelessly naïve.

I believe in cycles. The current one is sick and dying.
As I've written before: one day we will have to get rid of China too.

Do you have any examples? Unless you're talking about Vietnamese or even the Japanese hiragana and katakana scripts, which ultimately derive from the Chinese script, I would be really curious...

I'm not really sure you've thought through the global tongue scenario, if you see nothing wrong with that. English may be considered the global tongue now, but Chinese would have to have a stranglehold on the global population at a level that far surpasses that for the Chinese script to be the global script as well. Since we're assuming that the Latin script to fall off its pedestal, the billions of current English, Portuguese, and Spanish speakers would have to stop writing their native languages and switch to Chinese. Or are you saying that they can somehow find a way to use the Chinese script to write their own vernacular tongues?

The Chinese script has been dominant in East Asia for millennia; it is part of the cultures of Korea and Japan as well as China's. But it has proved restrictive to the use of vernacular languages in writing, which is why Korean and Japanese both developed their own scripts (in the former case, to the enormous protest of the literati who liked their monopoly on literacy). If there was any way the Chinese script could be used to write Korean or Japanese other than through impractical rebus-based systems, it would have been found sometime during the thousands of years of Chinese-script supremacy. When Chinese characters are used for writing Korean or Japanese, it is for writing Chinese loanwords, of which there are many. Extrapolating to languages that have had less contact with Chinese, I can't see how its speakers would start using the Chinese script other than by abandoning their vernacular tongues.

All this just to spite the current dominance of the Latin script? The Chinese script as lingua franca has been tried in the East Asian sphere and found wanting. Apologies if the future talk sounds like regression rather than progress to me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chữ nôm is a good example of the Chinese script adapted to a non-Chinese language, along with Zhuang logograms. Hiragana and katakana derive their forms from Chinese characters, but have passed into an entire different genre of writing system, the syllabary. No one considers them Chinese scripts any more than the Greek alphabet is considered a Semitic abjad.

The difference is that Vietnamese and Zhuang, being analytic languages with largely monosyllabic morphemes like Chinese, are more suited to a logographic writing system than the agglutinative Japanese. (As an aside, I think the current practice of using a Latin-based writing system for Vietnamese is rather unwieldy.) Syllabic writing systems, as it turns out, are effective for writing Japanese. The Chinese script simply served as a reference point because that was the only 'true' writing they really knew about.

Korean, on the other hand, has thousands of syllables in use and didn't find a workable solution until the featural alphabet Hangul was developed.

The moral is that each language has different needs that require different script solutions, and a Chinese-style logographic system may very well be the most restrictive and least adaptable one out there, suitable only for a handful of languages in China and Southeast Asia. In fact, the reverence for tradition and resistance to innovation in the world of written Chinese probably contributed to its survival to this age when other logographic systems around the world have been rendered obsolete by phonetic writing.

If anything, if I trust human creativity, I think the Chinese script will move further and further away from its logographic origins to reflect the changes in the Chinese language away from analytic features.</div>

It's not so simple. In fact, the unifying* spirit of Chinese (it deftly encodes the numerous languages of China) is exactly what an alphabet sucks at. Alphabets are seriously over-rated, to mythical proportions; and seeing a non-westerner fall for it is frankly quite sad.

Sure, but it will still be Chinese.
A script is never really a static, formal thing - not even for an instant.

That's not so simple either, as it is a result of a standardized literary language and spoken languages developing in tandem, and one has to ignore a large degree of diglossia, but let's leave it at that. 

If making cognates recognizable is the goal, alphabets work just fine. Many European languages that use the Latin script use near-identical spellings for Greek and Latinate vocabulary, when the pronunciations are quite different. French in particular uses a lot of phantom letters in their spelling to reflect etymological origins (e.g. the <em>g</em> in 'doi<em>g</em>t', cognate to 'digit'). I'd be hard pressed to make out a single word when someone is speaking Danish, but I understand a fair bit of written Danish because of its closeness to Norwegian.

But a true unifier would be something like bringing back Latin as the universal literary language in Europe, or Sanskrit in Northern India. Pretending that one can introduce a single unifying script for the different languages of Europe à la Chinese without enforcing a unifying language ignores the far greater diversity in grammatical structures and vocabulary between even the closely related Romance languages. Chinese was helped by strong central government starting with the First Emperor, who standardized writing across China; maybe European political unity can enforce a standardized pan-European literary language?

Hrant: <cite>Alphabets are seriously over-rated, to mythical proportions; and to see a non-westerner fall for it is frankly quite sad.</cite>

I reiterate, different languages require different script solutions. I am not advocating alphabets as the one-size-fits-all solution. Many nationalistic Koreans talk about the supremacy of the Korean alphabet and even exporting it for writing other languages, so I'm wary of that view.

But I think it's perfectly clear that the majority of the world's languages simply cannot be written with a manageable logographic system the way Chinese can be. Just how would one distinguish between the dozen different ways of describing 'yellow' in Korean, each with a different nuance, in such a system?

노랗다, 노르께하다, 노르끄레하다, 노르무레하다, 노르스름하다, 노릇하다, 노릇노릇하다, 노르톡톡하다, 노리께하다, 노리끄레하다, 노리무레하다, 노릿하다, 노릿노릿하다, 노리톡톡하다, 누렇다, 누리께하다, 누르끄레하다, 누르무레하다, 누르스름하다, 누릇하다, 누릇누릇하다, 누르툭툭하다, 누르칙칙하다, 샛노랗다, 싯누렇다.

I would rather not lose that diversity.</div>

Just because they're nationalistic doesn't mean they're wrong about every single thing. In fact the Korean script (which is not really an alphabet) <em>is</em> superior to every other one, at least in ways that count most. It makes Latin look like a village idiot. Does that mean Hangul can be used to encode every language ideally? Of course not. Does that mean it can't be improved? Of course it can. But it's still better than what most people have. The problem is that misplaced pride makes people -like that grade-A bigot Morison- adore alphabets, Latin, or whatever else is perceived as having helped them claw their way to the top of the pyramid.

I don't think such a thing is perfectly clear at all.

You want diversity? Step 1: Stop Latin.

		<div class="commentbody">So you think writing English logographically <em>is possible</em>, and moreover it's unclear whether that would be better or worse than the current method. That's what I wanted to know. Based on what I know about the English language and logographic writing systems, I thought it was obvious that it is impossible to reflect the English language in a logographic way without resorting to all kinds of non-intuitive markers that only Chomskyites would grasp (but then it would cease to be logographic and become unlike any writing system). Because my own reasoning behind this conclusion seemed so natural and obvious to me, I thought it was clear for everyone else, too, but there I was wrong.

So maybe you thought that Chinese could replace English as the lingua franca (plausible), and because of that influence other languages would start to be written in the Chinese script. That last part is the impossible leap for me.

For me, the only scenario where the Chinese <em>script</em> becomes the lingua franca is where people largely stop writing in non-Chinese languages altogether, using only Chinese for written communication. This far surpasses what any language up to now has done, including English. That sort of scenario where most literature (and any sort of writing) is produced in a single language seems dark and bleak to me. Do you think this will actually happen?

I believe in the Chinese ascendancy. More and more people will learn Chinese as a foreign language, as people are doing in droves in Korea. My father already speaks fluent Chinese, and I'm still learning. Soon the rest of the world will catch up. But please, believing that China will achieve the sort of cultural hegemony to drive out languages like English, Hindi, and Arabic from written use seems far-fetched. That's why I made that initial postscript comment about the "dark, bleak future" jocularly, thinking that you were being similarly mock alarmist with your Chinese-script-as-the-lingua-franca suggestion.

So we were not on the same page after all, and I guess to you I came across as a reactionary against Chinese ascendancy. I don't think I've been accused of sounding like a White House press release before.</div>

By the way, latin script has conquered China. Pin Yin, the romanization of Chinese is used to input Chinese on keyboards, so all young Chinese know the roman alphabet. It is also on road signs. The ease of keyboarding is a decisive advantage of alphabets. 

The whole structure of Chinese lends itself to the characters, and not only because it was the key to a unified empire--so that a unified China is ancient, whereas a unified Europe is still an aspiration.  </div>

The former seems quite likely to me (because paradoxically it's the westerner's conditioning to live materialistically that makes it so easy to purchase his loyalty). The latter is also likely, but in a much more limited scope. In the latter, more likely/widespread, and much more interesting (but yes, dangerous) is the way Chinese will change other writing systems, as Latin has been doing for so long.

Not really. The Romanization (not "language", script) of the planet is quite pronounced. Just look at Africa, Turkey, some Balkan countries, and even some south-east Asian countries.

Soon enough all young Westerners will know Chinese, and Mandarin. This has already started in Africa and South America. What's funny is, you set yourself up for it by making Capitalism your religion. You're available for sale to the highest bidder. The <em>Newest</em> Profession?

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, are you remembering to distinguish between language and script? The dominance of the Latin script and English as a de facto lingua franca are two separate issues.

I call the Latin script dominant not because it has the greatest number of users (the number of users of the Chinese script may already be greater, I don't know), but because it has been adopted by scores of different languages from different language families, including English. The influence of languages written in the Latin script, such as English, certainly played a great role, but the main thing was that the Latin script, being a phonetic system, proved supremely adaptable.

Such adoptions of scripts are perhaps doomed to be less than optimal most of the time. Latin might not be the optimal solution for Vietnamese, nor the Indic-based Tibetan script (note: another phonetic script) for the Tibetan. But they still produced solutions that worked well enough to stick.

But you won't see the languages switching allegiance to the Chinese script, even if there is all the motivation in the world to do so. <em>Chinese-style scripts cannot be used to naturally write anything other than a relatively small group of languages.</em> If there was any way at all that Korean and Japanese could be adequately written in Chinese, we would have figured it out sometime in the last couple of thousand years when we were firmly in the Chinese cultural sphere and absorbed everything Chinese. Fortunately, human creativity prevailed and we figured out writing systems that were actually capable of writing Korean and Japanese.

Only a very small number of languages at one end of the morphological spectrum lend themselves to being written with logographic writing systems. Most languages cannot simply switch over to being written in Chinese. A latter-day Atatürk who orders his national language to switch to Chinese writing would most likely be unable to find any linguist capable of carrying out the command.

I'm curious where you are getting your ideas about logographic writing systems if you think they can be readily applied to any language. There are certain advantages to using a logographic system, but written English already shares many of these advantages, being not purely phonetic but having many logographic features. Most languages are probably best served by scripts balancing phonetic and logographic features, and arguably written English has evolved to strike a close-to-optimal balance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">BTW William, your use of "conquered" is quite telling. It echoes the imperialistic jingoism of Morison: "The Roman alphabet is not merely in possession, but it is in possession by right of conquest. The conquest was not made possible, or even expedited, by external authority; the victory of the Roman letter was due to its inherent flexibility and rationalism." That's from his introduction in a book promoting the Latinization of... Hebrew! I'm sure you'd <em>love</em> to see the Torah and your other books Romanized...

		<div class="commentbody">So how can I make you understand that switching to the Chinese script is not an option for most languages because of an inherent mismatch between the morphologies of the languages and the nature of the script, not because of some cultural preference, politics, or emotions?

The dominance of the Latin script, loosely speaking, is a historical accident, owing to the Roman Empire, ascendancy of Western Europe, and all that. Any reasonable phonetic-based script could have taken its place.

But if we went into a counterfactual history where Chinese culture achieved supremacy the world over--if it were Chinese colonisers instead of Europeans entering Africa, Southeast Asia, and the New World in the last few centuries--the different languages of the world would still not have adopted the Chinese script. Instead, a diglossia would have developed where people would write in Chinese and speak in their vernacular tongues, or more likely the vernacular tongues would be supplanted by Chinese.

At this point, I'm wondering if you are the one driven by your emotions and false hope to seeing a ready alternative to Latin in the Chinese script when there isn't one. The Chinese script is perfectly suitable for the Chinese language (or at least as much as the Latin is for English), but expecting it to work for languages that don't share the features of Chinese betrays an ignorance of how a logographic writing system works.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Chinese script and the Latin script for English are mere examples chosen for convenience. I would use other logographic systems as examples, but both Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphs include phonetic elements.

Let's take for simplicity's sake only those Egyptian hieroglyphs that function as logograms. Do you think you could write Armenian with them? No, you couldn't. Could you write Ancient Egyptian with the Armenian script? Yes, you could, once you worked out some kinks. Would you agree, or am I betraying stunted imagination and creativity?

So my pointing out the limitations of the Chinese script for something it was never meant to be used for--writing languages other than Chinese--amounts to subjecting you to my supposed anti-Chinese upbringing? You're trying to make this look like a clash between those appealing to emotions, when I'm only trying to point out what I thought was a well-understood feature of the Chinese script.

So I can only conclude that I have been taking my familiarity with the Chinese script for granted, and others may not understand the most basic feature of the script to the point of harbouring illusions about it being portable across languages the way phonetic scripts can. Have you studied Chinese? That would help immensely in understanding what I'm talking about.</div>

This is the crux of the matter, and it is what Hrant is obviously unable to see or understand, either because he simply doesn't know enough about linguistics or because he is blinded by the fact that he is arguing with a dead man (Stanley Morison) and not genuinely engaged in a conversation with the people on this forum.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, what I'm usually accused of, including by you, is being too conservative in my respect for the traditional forms of the scripts I work with. The only case I can think of in which you might think me in favour of script reform is Cyrillic. But I have not advocated that Cyrillic should be reformed, only acknowledged the reality that it <em>was</em> reformed, 300 years ago, and that the linguistic and cultural heritage of that 300 year period makes the pre-Petrine forms inappropriate to modern texts.

<em>Of course I know how Chinese works. It’s not too complicated.</em>

Oh good, because I don't really understand it because I don't know enough about Chinese linguistics, which is why I have found Brian's comments to be helpful. But if you understand it, please explain it to me, and explain also the <em>reasons</em> why you disagree with Brian's analysis that the logographic writing system only works well for a narrow range of languages with particular morphologogical structures (of course, you will need to explain what those morphological structures are and why different morphologies are not a barrier to adapted use of a logographic writing system). Simply repeating that you disagree with Brian isn't advancing the discussion, especially not when he is displaying remarkable patience and taking the time to compose carefully reasoned arguments and you are responding with one-liners, irrelevancies and insults.

* I clearly remember you exclaiming: "I love it!"
And the smile on your face lasted at least an hour.

But during my Alphabet Reform talk in Boston, you said "it's like you're saying your wife's nose is too big." The proper Western reply to that would have been "Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't know she was your wife." But the best reply really is "She's not your wife, get over it."

But you're not that candid these days; these days, and in fact ever since that Boston talk, you consistently dig a deeper trench concerning any disagreement we might have, pretty much about anything. I think it's partly because you think I insulted your "wife", and partly because you don't like showing weakness. And you use classic Western twists of logic and rhetoric to avoid the perception that you should change your mind.

I'm sorry, but you're quite easy to read.
Being surrounded by people like you for 20+ years has helped.

No, I see it as Western coolness covering up intransigence.
And I cannot change people, not after a certain age, not via
an internet forum. Often my short replies are better than
ignoring somebody, at least in my eyes.

The idea that a person's opinions can be separated from that person's being and still be ideally addressed assumes that opinions are formed exclusively as a result of intellect and knowledge; that circumstance and emotion are irrelevant. This idea is a mainstay of Western argumentation, and it is naive and/or contrived in order to obstruct revelation. It is an idea that allows people to participate in discussion without taking on any true risk of change. It is fearful, lazy and despotic. The multifarious contexts of an opinion are integral to it; it is the pretending otherwise that I -naturally in the minority in this decidedly Western milieu- refuse to let slide. Often, what some people dismiss as a personal attack or an irrelevant/distracting aside is to me a piece of the puzzle of opinion - a refraction of Truth.

Hrant, I think you're mistaking me with someone else. Did I even attend your presentation in Rome? I have no memory of it. If I ever made any appreciative noise about that laughable piece of pseudo Arabic it would have been in appreciation of its humour. It's so over the top in its aping of a particular Latin original as to be just silly. Also, it's an advertising display face, so of absolutely zero interest to me typographically.

Not only do I not recall making the 'wife's nose' comment in Boston, it seems to me so unlikely a comment to have issued from my lips. Are you sure it wasn't someone else who said that?

Insulted my wife? I also don't recall you doing or saying anything regarding my wife.

So on all counts, I simply don't recall any of the things you recount, and in any case, not one of them indicates that I believe every script except 'my precious Latin' should be 'reformed up the wazoo'. Nor do I think I've ever shown any particular attachment or regard for the Latin script; indeed, it is precisely because I'm not particularly enamoured of it that I chose to work extensively with other writing systems.

You are, it seems to me, attacking a chimera, and I protest at being made to stand in for Stanley Morison in your fantasy battles.</div>

That one I remember like it was 6 minutes ago. But I agree that it was atypical (atypically candid) of you. Especially online, you've become extremely careful to leave the impression that you don't harbor opinions, you only harbor <em>facts</em>...

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant: <em>The idea that a person’s opinions can be separated from that person’s being and still be ideally addressed assumes that opinions are formed exclusively as a result of intellect and knowledge; that circumstance and emotion are irrelevant.</em>

But I'm not interested in your <em>opinions.</em> I'm interested in whether you have sufficient knowledge of a topic to justify having an opinion of it. If you opinion is <em>only</em> based on circumstance and emotion, then your opinion is irrelevant to everyone but yourself. It is only the degree to which your opinion is informed by knowledge that can be shared with other people that your opinion is of any value. I can't share in your emotions, and believe me, I have no wish to. And our circumstances are largely different and intersect only in the realm of typography and these particular forums. So we must rely on conversation to understand each other, and trying to second guess each other's emotional motivation seems to me simply insulting and 'helpful' only in self-justification. So you proclaim that I am 'easy to read', despite being consistently wrong about me. Maybe I'm easy to misread. Or maybe you're just generally good at misreading. I try to avoid 'reading' you or guessing your motivation, and am only forced to when you refuse to engage with the actual ideas that are being discussed and instead attack people and insult them. Then I have to wonder whether this is a defense mechanism against being exposed as not knowing what you're talking about. Frankly, I'd rather not play such games, and would prefer it greatly if you would just engage with the ideas. So, for instance, when Brian repeatedly and in different ways explains the linguistic reasons why he thinks the Chinese writing system is unsuited to writing many other languages, I'd like to see you respond to those reasons, i.e. to have a conversation about linguistics, which is the field in which Brian has indicated that he believes there to be limitations on the adaptability of Chinese script to other languages. Instead, you start insulting him and making crass assumptions about his motivation. Heck, maybe he is motivated by 'Western coolness covering up intransigence', despite being Korean, I don't know. And you don't know either. You're just playing at being a clever interpreter of human motives instead of engaging with his ideas. Neither of us knows Brian well enough to make such claims about his motivation. But his motivation isn't on the table. What is on the table are some specific ideas about the nature of Chinese morphology and the particular appropriateness of the Chinese writing system to such morphology. And those ideas you have still not addressed, and show no sign of addressing.

I have no trouble acknowledging the role of circumstance and emotion in the forming of opinion. But you frequently seem to treat them as the only factors, and deliberately ignore the contributions of intellect and knowledge. This is simply irrationalism, and it would be alarming if not for the fact that you apply it selectively, only resorting to it when you are clearly outgunned on the intellect and knowledge front. Or am I crassly second-guessing your motivation? I probably am, but at least I can see that.</div>

Since I have no memory of it, I can hardly deny that it happened. But I am confident in denying your interpretation of it. Looking at the image, I know exactly what my response would have been, because it is still my response: it is hilarious, and what makes it funny and in its own way strangely impressive is the way in which Latin letterforms have been used so uncritically as Arabic letters.</div>

Whereas you are insistent that all your opinions are insights.

Most of what I post belongs in the area between fact and opinion, i.e. the realm in which ideas are discussed among rational and educated people. Opinions are just solidifications of interpretation. Ideas are fluid, especially in the medium of conversation. But they have to be discussed in good faith, which means that the people engaged in the conversation have to deal with the ideas that are put forward.

Brian put forward some idea, and you have refused to deal with them, preferring to insult him by ascribing his ideas to unworthy motivations. I note that he seems now to have withdrawn from the conversation. I don't know whether that was because you insulted him, or because you didn't engage with his ideas so the conversation wasn't going anywhere. In either case, you are responsible for ending the possibility of fruitful discussion. Again.</div>

This is not humanly possible.

Every single thing you wrote in that paragraph reinforces my view that You Don't Get It. Your persistent inability or unwillingness to factor in things beyond intelligence and knowledge (and claiming otherwise is worth nothing) is what will always hold you back, what will forever prevent you from really understanding anything deeper than the ripples on the surface. Your formalism is your cage. At least, you are not alone.

		<div class="commentbody">And concerning what you (and Brian) see as the limitations of logography with respect to something like English, not only are you being too absolutist (pretending that something has to be perfect or even ideal for it to happen and be useful) but you're also exhibiting the typical rigidity when it comes to defining things (your definition of English for example is pretty much guaranteed to be shallow and convenient, and in the end useless - I know from experience of "discussing" things with you) as well as a complete lack of imagination concerning what really might be possible at the confluence of script, language, and the human mind. Einstein said "imagination is more important than knowledge". I know you disagree (you've said so) but many people don't, and this has nothing to do with intelligence or knowledge. Progress depends on imagination; it is a mystical force that suddenly makes something work, against all odds and expectations. But you are not interested in imagination or progress, you are interested in the elaboration of the status quo - so I guess you're doing just fine. Also, if I'm not spending the time elaborating on why you're wrong, all that means is that I think it's not worth the effort. And if you are spending the time, all that means is that it's important to you, nothing more. It doesn't take insight to type stuff up.

What is insulting is not my attempt at putting things in their
necessary personal context, it's your inhuman attitude towards
discourse, which is the golden heart of this watering hole.

This part of his remarks is what peeked my interest to know more:

"However, we were troubled by the limited number of submissions by Greek designers, mainly in the Text category, but also in the other categories. We were also troubled by the fact that in some submissions there was an obvious lack of technical skills and a lack of perception of the movement and the morphology of the letters."

The words "perception of the movement and the morphology of the letters" are what I would like to hear more about. This is where I feel I could learn the most from him and perhaps become better at designing Greek fonts. Too bad there was no record made, it would have been quite educational.
