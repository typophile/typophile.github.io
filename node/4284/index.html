<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This is something I was playing with for some time. <br>Fatum Eurydicae (Eurydica's Destiny)is a name for arty-farty cafe+giftshop, elite yet a bit kitchy. I was trying to achieve some kind of baroque feeling. <br>I was fooling around with some of my favorite typefaces - Garamond, English and Bull. Your opinion, please. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33458.jpg alt=example></div>

<div class=commentbody>Scott, the V would be latin for U. But, I agree, it's OK to cheat here and use a real U for readability's sake. <br> <br>I like the logo, btw, though "FATVM" seems to be floating a bit too much there.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the name and the direction you're going with combining a script and a text face. What sort of identity will this be for? Just a window sign? Or napkins, menus, gift bags, etc? <br> <br>I think if you're going to use the Latinized spelling of FATVM, then you should use an "obvious" Roman stonecut font, like <a href=http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/index.html>Requiem</a> or similar. You might want to spell 'Eurydice' in the modern fashion to avoid people seeing Every Dice. <br> <br>Also, I think the 'ae' ligature looks a bit much like an 'oe'.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks everyone. <br>I was thinking of using U instead of V in Eurydicae but wasn't sure. Thank you for your posts. <br>As for changing FATVM into serif capitals - dunno, I kinda like this look. <br>They were thinking of using this logo on employee's uniform, shopping bags etc. <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>I've made some changes - final ligature and "u". I didn't want to decrease the space between words too much, since I wanted to keep in some "drama". In my eyes the first thing you notice is Eurydica in rather romantic script. Placing Fatum (Fate) a bit on the side I wanted to create some kind of chill. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33559.jpg alt="second version"></div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't mind the placement of Fatum offset to the left; actually, I think it looks pretty good in that general vicinity. The changes you've made certanly improve readability. Is there another lc Y you could use to avoid/minimize that hole between 'r' and 'y'? <br> <br>I think this marque is great for printed materials, but you might have some translation issues when going to clothing or vinyls for a window. The size difference between Fatum and Eurydice would make the former very small on an embroidered shirt or apron, and the 'grunge' face might not be easy to cut out of vinyl. <br> <br>Good progress.</div>

<div class=commentbody>1. I don't think the Garamond is working here. The italics just don't look consistent enough to be used at display sizes. <br> <br>2. I Think you need to consider the historical implications of your typefaces. The average member of the populace won't know that Garamond is a Renassaince face, but the subconscious association is probably there nonetheless. If you're doing something with historical meaning, why not consider a face from that period? <br> <br>If you're stuck on the sans/serif combination, you might try a lapidary like Sophia or Lithos with a display Roman like Trajan.</div>

<div class=commentbody>@ DP: <br>Thank you for your opinion. <br>I think I got historical association exactly where I wanted. The thing is, I didn't want it to look Roman (or Grecian), I wanted it to look early Baroque, Classical in Louis XIV kind of way. Fatum Eurydicae sounds to me like a title of H. Purcell's play, or some of his conteporaties. <br>Think about it like that movie Gladiator - although it takes place in ancient Rome, theme, characters, costumes etc. are Baroque, not Antique.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hylas, I think the execution here could be improved by <br>some customization. <br> <br>fatum: the left arm of the u/v has a notch that heightens <br>the confusion as to what the letter is supposed to be. <br> <br>E: the script E seems too much like <br>a stock E out of a generic Copperplate face <br>... you could redraw this with some <br>different flourishes to make it yours. <br>A redraw would also allow you the opportunity <br>to fit the u with the E. As is, they seem much <br>too far apart. <br> <br>ae: the bowl of the e appears too small. <br> <br>d: the looped ascender looks like it was cut <br>and pasted on. Could be the .gif. The specific <br>angle doesn't seem to work, imo. <br> <br>Some flourishes might give this more of a Baroque flair. <br>There is always "flourish opportunity" <br>in ascenders or descenders. <br> <br>hope I'm not too harsh, but honest feedback <br>is why you brung it, I think. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>How is the main word pronounced? <br>yur-ID-uh-kay ? yur-ID-uh-say ? <br>With the y and d spaced apart, I was initially pronouncing it in a way that I am very much hoping is incorrect. =) Apology in advance, once you figure it out.

<div class=commentbody>It's Latin, so the closes pronounciation would be like in Italian {E like in b<b>E</b>d, U like in b<b>OO</b>t, R like in <b>R</b>ed, y like in happ<b>Y</b>, d like in <b>D</b>ay, i like in sh<b>EE</b>p, c like ch in <b>CH</b>eer, ae like e in b<b>E</b>ed} Or you can pronounce it like in Central Europe, with Tz instedad of Ch, or like K instead of Ch. Every spelling is equaly incorrect, since Latin is a dead language. Since I'm not working in English-speaking country, nobody will read it like EV'RY DICE (so nobody would think it is a casino <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> )</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with BJ, if you're going for a Baroque feel, you should work in some custom flourishes on the curved ascender of the D and perhaps the descender on the Y. Perhaps even "tail" the E portion of the ae lig. <br> <br>Actually, you could connect your flourish on the Y to the end of the uppercase E for a nice complete look.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It seems a rather long name for a cafe/bookstor etc. It would be simpler to brand if it was called "FATVM". <br> <br>But then again, I am always leaning towards less is more (looks at name), and us antipodes usually cannot read past a few syllables. <br> <br>FATVM sounds so rich and simple. That second one would make me feel like I was reading a Latin Novel... All I want is coffee! <br> <br>mwah </div>

<div class=commentbody>1. I'm not the owner and don't have the liberty to change the name. <br>2. It's not a Starbuck's - people go there to look posh, not to drink coffee (or to read books). It's a place where you dress yourself as if you're going to Ascot race, drink some lousy coffee and buy some over-priced books. <br>3. Fatum (Destiny)is too general. The name Eurydica's Fate is chosen as a sort of a warning, meaning DON'T LOOK BACK! <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>In my opinion Eurydicae is not working. The E is heavy and of a completely different nature than the rest. The d is throwing off the rythm. I think it will want to be right leaning, perhaps with a loop that curls around and crosses itself moving back toward the E. <br> <br>See if you can find lettering to work from. Or a better drawn font. BJ has rightly pointed out some issues with this one. <br>Something like this? <br><a href=http://www.kimera.com.mx/mac/tipogalerialagarto.html target=_blank>http://www.kimera.com.mx/mac/tipogalerialagarto.html</a> <br>Maybe Bickham Script <br> <br>R</div>
