  have a tendency to 'clash' and that are most likely to occur in extended languages.\r\n\r\nI
  generally know what they are and have made pairs with exceptions in the past to
  handle the ones that I believe would be common.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that if there
  was a list I could prevent having to kern pairings that would potentially never
  occur."

  body: "Thanks. Filip, that article is excellent.\r\n\r\nI've pretty much solved
    the problem, in that I'm kerning every potential accented character clash, regardless
    if it's perceived as 'common', or not.\r\n\r\nI've been kerning 'lower case\u2014upper
    case', 'unusual' combinations, and 'demoninators, numerators, superiors, inferiors'
    and others listed in the article for awhile now. I'm taking note on a couple things
    I've overlooked, such as 'german quotes' and having a closer look at Lcaron and
    the potential issues with lslash as well."
