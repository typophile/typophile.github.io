body: Does anyone have a source for this piece of lettering. I used it in my logo
  years ago and found it in a book of ornaments and initials that came from my father-in-law.
  Years ago I lent the book out to someone who never returned it. I'm looking for
  more information about it and a high resolution scan. Clearly it has a Classical
  Roman Capital pedigree, but I'd love more detailed particulars.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P_IN_GRID_3783.jpg]

  body: It's recognizably descendant of the letters on the trajan column, yes. But
    I'm looking for particulars.
