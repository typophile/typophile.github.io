  (transfer sheet) that looked like stacked layers of the same character. The \"O\"
  for example, had two-three levels on top of the base \"O\" so it appeared dimensional.
  Similar to movie theater marqee letters.\r\n\r\nAlready spent a couple of hours
  looking for it, but without a name I keep running into dead ends.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  remember or know face's name?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\t-equinoxtwo\r\n          equinoxtwo@embarmail.com"
