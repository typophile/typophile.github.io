body: I showed this to my client and he wanted me to make this font for his website.  Well,
  there isn&#39;t time or budget to do this, so I would like to find something similar.  I
  could even add the drop shadow effect myself if you all knew of a close enough font.
  <BR> <BR>thanks. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/47546.gif"

    target=_top> Amarillo</a> is kind of close but  maybe too many spurs, and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/bank-gothic-ef/medium/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=STABILIMENTI+FOTOTIPOGRAFIA"

    identical to FF Gothic. <BR> <BR>I ended up making the letters i needed. was fun.

    was a reinterpretation of the Bank Gothic model.
