<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This is a logo I've been working on for a client who is opening a small, indepentent neighborhood bakery. Fresh handcrafted artisan baked goods will be the focus, but the bakery will also offer a small coffeeshop, limited delicatessen and bistro-style and sidewalk dining. <br> <br>The bakery will be located in the Avenues neighborhood of Salt Lake City, hence the name. <br> <br>After a few false starts on an image concept, this is the image and type treatment that the client liked. <br> <br>The colors are based on (and meant to be evocative of) the characteristics of baked bread, and the overall feeling we've been trying to create is a simple, rustic, artisan-style charm. <br> <br>There will also be a horizontal banner version, with the mark set to the left and the type in two lines next to it. <br> <br>Comments appreciated! <br> <br>David <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15436.gif alt=AvenuesBakeryLogo4LR.gif></div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the warm colors and the man wearing an apron. Not sure about the italic set on a curve, it makes a funny space between the A and v. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks. I think all good logos should involve a man wearing an apron. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>You're right about the awkward space in the "Av" combination. I'll try redrawing the "A" to compensate. <br> <br>Any other thoughts? I'll be out of town until Monday, but I'll check back then for more ideas and to post a reworked version. <br> <br>David <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>david. hmm. will they have croissants? what's the address? what about pan chocolat? <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> About the logo. I've always like the idea of the illustration creating the shape, when possible, without having to use a shape. Does that make sense. As you have used the idea of something old and craftsmanlike, perhaps you could imbue the illustration with more a sense of history?? And perhaps instead of all italic incorporate some roman or a friendly sans??</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't think you need the gradiant. Maybe try a solid brown or split it into two fields (wall/floor?). The gradient just seems way to modern of a technique for the style you are going after. <br> <br>The italics just doesn't work on a curve. I agree with what Tiffany says...maybe try some other type forms. <br> <br>It's a nice illustration. You may want to beef up a few of the negative lines if you go with a smaller version of it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi David. <br> <br>Sorry for a grumpy opinion, but I think this one is missing. I don't know the client, or what they have in mind for the decor... <br> <br>Type: I agree the italics on the circle isn't working. Try open capitals (?), big bold deco sans (?) <br> <br>Illustration: This is saying clip artisan to me. Too computerized for an artisan outfit. I'm looking for an engraving, or a woodblock print, or scratchboard... not vectorville. <br> <br>There was a gelato shop logo that got posted a few months back that I think was suffering from the same sort of trouble. I know Louise Fili was mentioned elswhere recently, but check out that site for some gourmet/food/restaurant delectable type. <a href=http://www.louisefili.com target=_blank>www.louisefili.com</a> <br> <br>Maybe it's modeled after an old streetsign (I've got some photos if you want). Maybe it's not old at all, it's just where my mind goes first. All that to say, I've seen your postings at typophile and have been impressed. This isn't it, but you're surely capable. Sneek away from your machine, and go for it (fresh bread on hand might not help!) <br> <br>Good luck, <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>After a week of design classes, I believe I'm qualified to shoot my mouth off, so here goes: <br> <br>Something's not quite working with the type. I think it's the ascenders and descenders - you have to leave a lot of space for them, so everything floats instead of feeling integrated. <br> <br>As for the illustration, Randy said it - it needs a warmer handmade feel. I'd also add that you should get to the essentials, cropping it fairly tight around the hands and the loaf. To me the focus of the image should be the bread, not so much the artisan. <br> <br>I also think the dark brown should be pulled back. As it stands it looks almost black. Despite sounding cliche, I think the pallette should be muted and more in the grain/crust color range. <br> <br>Okay, I'll stop now.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'll just add my "seconds" to what's been already said, namely: <br> <br>1. Italic type on a curve not working <br>2. Hand-crafted logo perhaps better than vector <br>3. Gradients aren't necessarily helping <br>4. Love the apron <br> <br>Also I might add that this image you're showing seems familiar to me - the side view of a baker shoveling bread to/from a brick oven - is there another angle or focus that could be explored to make the logo more ownable?</div>

<div class=commentbody>That was the other idea I had - hands kneading dough, or something suggestive of hand-crafting loaves. Never mind that even artisan breads are kneaded in giant mixers - they're still handcrafted in a way mass-produced bread isn't. <br> <br>The "flat stick" used to slide loaves in the oven is called a peel (or baker's peel).</div>
