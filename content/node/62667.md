    is somewhat like your sample. He does a lot of custom work, and this might be
    one of his.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    wasn't done by Angel Koziupa, as your first impulse suggested. Look how similar
    the lettering looks in [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/pronto/|Pronto]].There
    are others that are also very similar, just not this exact font (yet), in what
    I have seen.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
