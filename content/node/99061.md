body: "Hi all,\r\nI\u2019m thinking about using Tiempos (Text) for an identity I\u2019m
  working on. The wordmark is set in Brandon Grotesque, and the two look quite good
  together to my eye. \r\n\r\nSadly, Tiempos is not (yet) available for web use. Can
  anyone recommend something similar that comes with a webfont license, and is well
  enough designed and produced that it can be used at (possibly slightly larger) text
  sizes on the web? My alternative right now is Benton Modern RE, but its flavor is
  not quite what I want here. \r\n\r\nWhat I like about Tiempos is that it feels  high-class,
  generous, and classy without being boring or generic\u2026 or too cute. I see a
  bit of Plantin in it, which is very welcome. I like the width and large x-height,
  and a super bonus is the \u201CM\u201D with the slanted stems at similar angles
  to Brandon. Also the fact that it has a Headline companion would be great for this
  project.\r\nThe application is clothing/fashion related, but more classy/conservative
  than extravagant.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d love to find something that\u2019s similar enough
  to Tiempos to just be substituted on the web; but suggestions for other picks that
  could cover both web and print are welcome too.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNina"

  body: "Hey Nina,\r\nI answered you on twitter, but we might as well keep the discussion
    going here. As Tiempos has roots as a newspaper typeface, it seems fitting to
    keep in the tradition. Webtype has [[http://www.webtype.com/font/elmhurst-family/|Elmhurst]],
    Typekit has, at this point ubiquitous, [[https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-meta-serif-web-pro|Meta
    Serif]],[[https://typekit.com/fonts/le-monde-journal-std|Le Monde Journal]], &
    my personal favorite [[https://typekit.com/fonts/freight-text-pro|Freight Text]]."

  body: "Ah, thanks, I\u2019ll delete my Twitter reply, there\u2019s a bit more space
    here.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to not overplay the \u201Cnewspaper\u201D side of things
    \u2013 I need this to feel classy. Tiempos can ride that line, I think, but e.g.
    LMJ is potentially a bit too harsh/sharp/newspapery. Freight might work, it\u2019s
    a bit too decorative perhaps with all these balls (I generally like it lots though).
    Meta Serif is a bit too German (and too ubiquitous), I think. Elmhurst is lovely
    but only recommended for very large sizes. Hmm. Interesting impulses, though."

    Recently I stumbled across <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_text\">Greta
    Text</a> by Typotheque. It has that boldness of Tiempos and for the most part
    it looks like a great solution, although I've yet to try it myself.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems really flexible with the available <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_sans\">sans</a>
    and the beautifully dangerous <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_grande\">headlines</a>
    too. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Robin. I like Greta a lot, but for this application it might be a
    little too\u2026 sharp \u2013 it does have a lot of bite (especially in the gorgeous
    Italic), which is great but not what I\u2019m looking for this time.\r\nI might
    have to take this into a slightly different direction\u2026 keep them coming if
    you have any other ideas :)"
