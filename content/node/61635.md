  last year with a lettering artist doing brush letters with his son (or nephew?).
  For the life of me I can't seem to find it in the archives. Does anyone have any
  idea who it was (European, Spanish maybe?) and have a url link.\r\nAlso any other
  links to great videos on brush and pen techniques for historical lettering forms
  would be appreciated.\r\nCheers,\r\nBrian"
