  know what they are ?! I&#39;ve got a couple of fairly close examples, but I&#39;d
  like to get the real thing if I could. <BR> <BR>The first two I&#39;m after are
  the ones found on vintage travel posters like this one : <BR> <BR><a href="http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/PIN/VNT16.jpg"
  target="_blank">http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/PIN/VNT16.jpg</a> <BR>
  <BR>The orange font - is that the font I&#39;ve seen that&#39;s called simply &#39;Art
  Deco&#39;, or does anything know of anything very similar &#40;particularly if free
  !&#41;. Also, anyone know what the white &#42;&#39;Monte Carlo Superieur&#39;&#42;
  font is ? <BR> <BR>The third, 1930s font I&#39;d like is the one seen, again on
  posters, but in particular British travel ones including British Rail. It&#39;s
  on these two posters : <BR> <BR><a href="http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/AWI/AW1160.jpg"
  target="_blank">http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/AWI/AW1160.jpg</a> <BR>
  <BR><a href="http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/VIS/v202.jpg" target="_blank">http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/VIS/v202.jpg</a>
  <BR> <BR>This font looks so simple - could it possibly just be arial or something
  ? Any advice on achieving this ? <BR> <BR>Cheers'

    text in the first poster.
