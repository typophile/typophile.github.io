<p>In the example below you can see in blue the characters for a hard break (Return) and a soft break (Shift-Return). If you have a soft break after the subhead, InDesign will view the subhead as part of the paragraph below it, and the leading you apply to the text might end up accidentally getting applied to the head also.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/breaks_6092.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;re adjusting the text&rsquo;s leading via a style sheet, make sure the subhead doesn&rsquo;t accidentally have the same style sheet applied to it as the text, or that the subhead&rsquo;s style isn&rsquo;t based on the text&rsquo;s style. One way to check that is to open the style sheet for the text and change the text&rsquo;s color. If the color of the subhead changes too, then you know it&rsquo;s a style sheet problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here is the standard behavior. The Item Head has 18pt linespacing (baseline-to-baseline distance from Subject Head to Item Head). The text is set 12pt on 15pt linespacing. Thus the baseline-to-baseline distance between Item Head and Text is 15pts.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/BaselineNormal_3572.png" alt=""></p>
<p> 
If you want the baseline-to-baseline distance between Item Head and Text to be 12 pts, then baseline shift the Item Head -3pts. But that will open up equivalent space above; so, to maintain Subject-to-Item spacing, you have to reduce the linespacing on Item Head by the same amount: thus it now has 18 – 3 = 15pt linespacing.</p>

<p>Okay very good. Even though it wasn&rsquo;t part of the solution this time, viewing the hidden characters is a good troubleshooting tip to remember.</p>
<p>In fact I routinely make the hidden characters visible while working on documents. It&rsquo;s a good way to immediately spot formatting errors such as extra spaces, soft breaks where hard breaks were intended, and so forth.  And when I import Word files given to me by clients, I often find that they&rsquo;ve used a lot of weird formatting techniques (forcing a line break by inserting a tab at the end of a line, for example), and showing hidden characters makes these things easy to spot.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Word and InDesign I think use different metrics in the font and handle them differently. In InDesign you have much better and more explicit controls. The top line begins with ascenders just below the top of the text box—unless you lock the text or the first line to the grid—and then you&rsquo;ve got controls over everything else.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t take the Word file and expect it to look identical in InDesign. As Theunis says, the best thing is to forget about the formatting in the original Word document, and re-set it afresh in InDesign, using its better controls.</p>

<p>@ William - Yes, indeed you have a very good point regarding metrics. I know that it will be very hard to make a perfect copy of how it appears in Word which is why I have been trying to create a new style set so that I can copy-paste plain text and format using styles. My problem is that some of the documents are 200+ pages. In terms of resetting though, take a look at this image:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Example3_5463.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the effect I am trying to achieve, but using ID&rsquo;s &ldquo;better controls&rdquo; it should be possible to create this layout without having to use two styles for each paragraph. In the example above the first line is &ldquo;no leading&rdquo; as described in previous post, and 2nd, 3rd and 4th lines are &ldquo;with leading&rdquo;. Notice at the end of the 1st line there is a ¶?</p>

<p>Perhaps there&rsquo;s some workaround to do that, but a simple design change would eliminate your formatting problems. Have you considered just putting more space below the item heading? Just give it the same leading as the paragraph below it.</p>
<p>This would make the formatting much simpler. You wouldn&rsquo;t have to mess with baseline shifts or other workarounds, and frankly I think it would look better, too.</p>
<p>(If you&rsquo;re worried that this spacing change would make the item and subject heads too much alike, perhaps one could be made italic.)</p>

Showing the Character palette was just a quick and easy way to demonstrate the concept and to show both baseline shift and change in leading in a single shot. In practice, it is advisable to implement this as part of the Item Head paragraph stylesheet. I just didn’t bother to demonstrate that way.</p>
<p>It is precisely because this approach is implementable at a global, stylesheet level that I suggested it, rather than the more obvious but high-maintenance and manually tedious method Peter discovered for himself.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, I&rsquo;m checking how Word works. Normally you control spacing between lines in Word by the format paragraph menu, not the format character menu. When you tell it to do 1 1/2 line spacing, it applies that to lines <em>below</em> the formatted lines, not above, so the behavior is opposite of InDesign, which I think is what has been confusing you.</p>
<p>Word automatically sets I think 20% leading as &ldquo;single&rdquo; spacing, so you have to work from that to translate between InDesign and Word. And 1 1/2 lines of 12 pt is not 18 pt but 21.6 pt (I think). You have to use the &ldquo;exactly&rdquo; line measurement in points if you want to set the distance between baselines to an exact point measurement.  In any case, it will not affect the line above the paragraph, but below. Let me put this another way: if you want to control layout precisely, Word is a nightmare.</p>
<p>So just design in InDesign and be happy. Or less unhappy, depending on your temperament.</p>
<p>You answered Kent that the problem was not the heading. But you are thinking in Word, not InDesign, where the vertical gap affects lines above, not below, as in Word. So his work-around for full paragraphs, which is necessary to put in a paragraph style sheet, has to involve the heading in InDesign. So his work clever work around—thanks Kent—will work as promised. Try it, you&rsquo;ll like it :)</p>

<p>But, if you really want it, here&rsquo;s how you do it simply.</p>
<p>Create a paragraph style with the appropriate leading for the entirety of the paragraph. Then create a separate character style that is identical (and &ldquo;based on&rdquo;) the first style, but with less leading. Add the character style to the paragraph style as a &ldquo;nested line style&rdquo; that will apply it to just the first line.</p>
<p>Done!</p>

<p>I feel the same way.  My guess is that the tight spacing below the item header is intended to help make it look different than the subject headers, but to me the spacing looks odd.</p>
<p>Plus it creates technical difficulties, which can be especially difficult for someone who says he&rsquo;s an InDesign novice. My suggestion (as I mentioned earlier) is to modify the design slightly by adding more space below the item header. I think it would look better and would eliminate the technical difficulties.</p>

<p>Joshua’s is an equally clever solution.</p>
<p>One clarification: you can’t base a Character style on a Paragraph style.* Just make sure that the only value defined in your first-line character style is the leading field (presumably the only value you want to override for the first line). All other fields should be left blank in order to have any future edits to the paragraph style maintain precedence.</p>
<p>*This is true up to CS 5, anyway. I don’t know if maybe Adobe changed this in CS 5.5</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Word automatically sets I think 20% leading as &ldquo;single&rdquo; spacing,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, Word&rsquo;s &ldquo;single&rdquo; spacing is font-specific, depending on the vertical metrics of the font (usually equvialent to the vertical extents of the bounding box). So in one font it might be 15% and in another it might be 40%. Thanks to this, even applying italics or boldface on a given line can change the spacing in Word&hellip;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Word&rsquo;s line-spacing issues can be avoided by setting the line spacing in pts instead of &ldquo;single&rdquo; and so forth.</p>
<p>Additionally, in western fonts cross-platform line spacing differences in Word would be simply a font bug. Carefully produced fonts can avoid this by synchronizing the platform-specific metrics in the font. I don&rsquo;t know if there is anything special going on for Asian fonts in this regard such that it is more problematic, or if it&rsquo;s still just an easily corrected error in font production.</p>
