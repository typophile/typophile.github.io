body: "I'm trying to write a simple python script that acts on the glyphs that the
  user has selected in the FontLab font window:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/glyph-slots.png\"
  />\r\n\r\nI'm especially interested in the glyphs (or maybe more accurately \"glyph
  slots\") that are in the encoding but are un-filled.\r\n\r\nSo far I've tried two
  things:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# 1 - glyph slots\r\nselectedSlots = fl.count_selected\r\nprint
  \"Number of selected glyph slots:\", selectedSlots\r\n</code>\r\n<code>\r\n# 2 -
  selected glyph names\r\nselectedNames = [ fl.font.glyphs[i].name for i in range(len(fl.font.glyphs))
  if fl.Selected(i) ]\r\nprint \"List of selected glyph names:\", selectedNames\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nScript
  number 1 reports a count of the full user selection - all selected glyph slots -
  filled and un-filled - perfect! Script number 2 returns a list of glyphnames but
  only the selected glyphs that are filled - no good. Results of running 1 and 2:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nNumber
  of selected glyph slots: 3\r\nList of selected glyph names: ['eacute']\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone suggest a technique that will list the glyphnames associated with all the
  selected glyph slots?\r\n\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n- kannery"

    'aacute', 'eacute', 'iacute', 'oacute', 'uacute', 'yacute', 'cacute']\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
    even if the slots are empty, FontLab also knows how many slots are selected (see
    script #1 in my first post). So possibly there is a way for FontLab to associate
    glyphnames with selected slots -- empty or not.\r\n\r\nI hope. Is there a way?\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n-k\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't use Fontlab (I use mainly FontForge); it seems to me you are trying
    to list names of characters that are not in the font. What you can do is determine
    the unicode range of those characters that are in the font and then print the
    names given by the encoding. If the first and last character are in the font then
    the following code seems to work on my demo version of Fontlab\r\n<PRE>\r\ndef
    encodingNames():\r\n  gl = fl.font.glyphs\r\n  sIndices = [ g.unicode \r\n     for
    g in gl if fl.Selected(g.index) ]\r\n  eNames = [ enc[i].name \r\n     for i in
    range(sIndices[0],sIndices[-1]+1) ]\r\n  return eNames\r\nprint \"List of glyph
    names in the selected range:\", encodingNames()\r\n</PRE>\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your suggestion Michel, its an interesting script. But unfortunately
    your script would only work for me in a very rare special case: if the user happens
    to select a filled slot with an ID thats numerically lower than any unfilled selected
    slot AND, at the same time, the user also happens to select another filled slot
    with an ID thats numerically higher than any selected unfilled slot.\r\n\r\nIts
    just too narrow of a scenario, but your script does give some inspiration for
    crafty workarounds, so thanks.\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm after would be a magical
    method where you could probe for glyphnames like this:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfl.font.encoding.Selected(glyphname)\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nWhere
    it would return TRUE if the encoding slot was selected.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n-k"
