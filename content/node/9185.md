body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I am new to this forum, and have simple question for start. <BR>
  <BR>How can I instruct indesign to use locl feature to select serbian cirilic glyphs
  from open type font. Is it possible at all, and is there any software which I can
  use to get alternative serbian cyrilic glyphs directly typed from keyboard.  <BR>
  <BR>So far I have selected serbian cyrilic keyboard, but indesign seems not to understand
  that it is serbian cirilic, so I have to manualy insert alternate glyphs. <BR> <BR>thanks
  in advance <BR>robby

    the locale &#40;&#39;locl&#39;&#41; feature. We hope to see such support at some
    point in the future. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Hi Thomas, <BR> <BR>thanks for prompt reply. <BR> <BR>Do you have any idea
    how can I use locl feature in any application on PC &#40;or mac eventualy&#41;?
    I mean it is nice to have such feature, and for typeseting cyrilic italic it is
    the only way to have serbian cyrilic in font, but what&#39;s the use if i have
    to manualy insert alternate glyph for g,p,t... for every occurence in text. Is
    there maybe some way to do global find/replace on the glyph level? Should I maybe
    tweak the font with fontographer?  <BR> <BR>thanks again <BR>robby

  body: will the locl feature be implemented in the next version of InDesign? Or would
    a Stylistic Set be a good way to implement these kinds of alternates in the meantime?

  body: Sorry, been busy lately. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t comment on features
    in unannounced Adobe products. <BR> <BR>Given that the alternate glyphs would
    have the same underlying Unicode, I don&#39;t see anything massively wrong with
    using a stylistic set as well as the locale feature &#40;though I wouldn&#39;t
    do it &#34;instead of&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>T

    <BR>yes, that makes much better sense.
