body: This typeface is used all over the CUIP for <BR>permanent signage and for special
  events. A variety <BR>of non-Roman characters &#40;here the &#34;o&#34;, &#34;n&#34;
  etc.&#41; <BR>are combined in various ways, the characters <BR>changing from sign
  to sign. <BR>All information about the typeface and the  <BR>designer&#40;s&#41;
  is appreciated. Thanks. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/17477.gif"
