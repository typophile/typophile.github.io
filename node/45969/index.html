  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m setting text featuring a lot of TLAs, and whilst I know that the perceived wisdom is to set the acronyms in small caps, in the fonts I&rsquo;m using (FF Scala Pro and FF Scala Sans Pro), the small caps don&rsquo;t seem to work. SP and SSP don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;petite&rdquo; cap option.</p>
<p>Based on the sample below, what do people think - am I so used to seeing the full height caps for these acronyms that my eyes are lying to me, or am I missing a third way?</p>
<p>Best,</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This topic has been covered before, many times, but the place to start is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why<!-- raw HTML omitted --> many typographers use small caps for acronyms. The answer usually given &ndash; and the one I would give &ndash; is that full caps, like lining figures, call attention to themselves because of their physical size. When that attention is unwanted, they are awkward.</p>
<p>But consider a book about FDR, where &ldquo;FDR&rdquo; is one of few acronyms or abbreviations in the entire text. Here, it would be odd to minimize the force of the name &ndash; spelled out, Franklin Delano Roosevelt would have initial caps, &amp; so &ldquo;stand out.&rdquo; In fact this happened in a book I designed, and I set FDR in full caps throughout.</p>
<p>If the acronyms in the copy you are setting are an important part of the sentences &ndash; rather than, say, just a passing reference, you may want to set them all full cap.</p>
<p>However, should you decide on small caps, you can make them a bit bigger than comes form the foundry. InDesign at least, lets you search for character style as an option, so you could search &amp; replace (say) 10-point small caps with 10.5, or whatever size seems to give the bit more emphasis you feel needed.</p>
<p>FWIW</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks both.</p>
<p>Charles: a difficult one, but the sheer density of the acronyms is what has me reaching for the smallcap. The paragraph shown above is representative of pretty much <em>every</em> paragraph in the text.</p>
<p>I have the acronyms styled in InDesign so it&rsquo;s straightforward to use a slightly larger size.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<blockquote>
<p>spelled out, Franklin Delano Roosevelt would have initial caps, &amp; so “stand out.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No it doesn&rsquo;t. If it was typed FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, then it would stand out. When the caps are separated by lower case letters, then the effect of a blob of caps is eliminated.</p>
<p>The effect is not nearly so nasty with smaller acronyms and initialisms. Most people don&rsquo;t small cap US, because it then seems to become the word us, and creating confusion to the reader is much worse than having bad color through full caps.</p>
<p>(All that said, I find the small caps in the original posting to be too small. Is there a rule that a designer must design his small caps to the x-height? That is fine for ITC type faces, but when the x-height is small I would think a better design is to be slightly larger than the x-height.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Don, When I look to see what stands out, I read. Moreover, I read at least a page, not a single phrase. So here is the test. Set two pages of type (a spread) that has the words &ldquo;Fanklin Delano Roosevelt about 15 times. See if that doesn&rsquo;t catch you eye &ndash; unless you&rsquo;re a Regan Republican.</p>
<p>A curmudgeon I remain; from my perspective, one of the problems with some typographers is they look at a small sample of type, in a certain context, and draw a(n almost absolute) conclusion. They aren&rsquo;t alone; editors are apt to do the same, though often their conclusions vary from the typographer. And of course the same could be said of me. But I remain convinced that the best answer to many questions about how to handle a text element visually will vary depending on the text itself, along with considering the intended audience. That&rsquo;s why design is more than memorizing a set of rules.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve hit this problem. IMO, it&rsquo;s usually a sign of badly-written text. I was working on a publication for a government, you seem to have be working on one for a multinational corporation.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t rewrite the text, you ideally want a typeface with a small cap whose height is in between the x-height and the full cap. This is because when you begin a sentence with an acronym (and it will happen sooner or later), the small cap will be clearly too small otherwise.</p>
<p>I was using Jeremy Tankard&rsquo;s Bliss (has x-height small caps) when I hit this problem, and I sent him an email asking for a solution. He was good enough to telephone me, but couldn&rsquo;t really offer any suggestion other that rewriting the text. In the end, I scaled up a lighter weight of Bliss to get the in-between caps I was after. I thought it worked OK, but I&rsquo;m not sure what Tankard&rsquo;s opinion was.</p>
