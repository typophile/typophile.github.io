  body: "Sorry, couldn\u2019t find a match on the serif typeface. Looks like a hand-drawn
    variation of Century Schoolbook:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-schoolbook/\r\n\r\nCould
    be a scrapbooking font not catalogued on the major databases. Only found one vaguely
    similar:\r\nhttp://www.fontspace.com/nicks-fonts/pyriform-tones-nf\r\n\r\nAnyone
    else bothered by the grammatical error on the sample? (The script line should
    read \u201CMake Life More Grand,\u201D not \u201CMakes,\u201D for verb/subject
    concordance.)"
