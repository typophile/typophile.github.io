  body: "Victoria, I'm pretty sure that the recent William Caslon Text by William
    Berkson is a nice contemporary rendition of Caslon:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/williamscaslontext/\r\n\r\nAnother
    functional choice - and a different interpretation - would be King's Caslon by
    Daltoon Maag:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/kingscaslon\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of Baskerville, I'm currently setting a book in Baskerville 1757 and I have to
    say that it is great:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/baskerville-1757/styles"
