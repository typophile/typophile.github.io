body: "I began this sculpture about three years ago now. I think it's coming up to
  a point where I can begin to show it off.\r\n\r\nThe phrase OK has a fundamental
  baseness to it. Doesn't it? More often than not a guarded inward type of expression
  / realization. Ya, it's OK. More often than not - OK - is a personal realization
  / communication. How ya doing? I'm OK. Or, OK ya I get it. Sometimes it's associated
  with a subjugation of some sort. OK for now. And I'm sure there are a lot of other
  meanings behind the expression of saying and being - OK.\r\n\r\nSo my concept is
  to combine the letters O and K in the form of a OK ligature, (the letter shapes
  are part of a stencil font I designed a while back) which gives the sculpture a
  guarded strength to it in a block-ish sort of mass / volume. But the expression
  is also incredibly open! And in that there is a want to invite the viewer and a
  need to share and experience - being OK. I created the sculpture that way so that
  the viewer can go inside the letter shapes!! The expression - OK - then becomes
  shared. The viewer is the letter shape fill.\r\n\r\nFor the first run of OK sculptures
  one version will be done in chrome - to reflect the viewer and the surroundings.
  Another version will have graffiti written in black and red (etc.) on white inside
  and out as an association to rebel and personal expression with the edge done in
  black. Another will be orange on the outside and yellow on the inside. And on that
  note, inside and outside are one. Follow around the outside and you will go inside
  the bowl of the O! So, the inward expression of being OK becomes a strong outward
  expression of being - OK.\r\n\r\nI want to do one eight feet high and have it on
  permanent display somewhere!! I want to see kids to play inside the letter shapes!!
  In the long run I'm going to pimp this sculpture. It will be on key chains, it will
  become a base for tables, it will even become a door stop made of cast iron!!\r\n\r\nAnyways,
  I'm beginning to ramble on, I hope you enjoy my little something or other...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OK_1_4128.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OK_2_6523.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OK_3_4747.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OK_4_4531.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OK_5_5419.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OK_6_4492.jpg]\r\n\r\n:)"
