body: "Hi,\r\nI was wondering if someone could help me finding good pairing fonts
  for Dezen Pro regular (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dizajndesign/dezen-pro/regular/),
  mostly based on the same x height.\r\nI would love to  find the fonts that are different
  in the cut style but still create a good balance. \r\nDezen Pro will be used mainly
  as a title's font and the pairing font as text.\r\n\r\nNow that there are millions
  of typefaces to choose from, what would be the best way to choose a good pair, specially
  based on the x height? Is there an application I could use that would allow me to
  overlap/compare side-by-side fonts on the fly without rely on  Illustrator or Indesign?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks for all your help,\r\nNuno"

    are marvellous."
