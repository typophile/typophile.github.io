    pay the designers a royalty, and retain the rest of the sale profits. <BR> <BR>
    <BR>JFP, Linotype owns an exclusive license to sell all ITC typefaces made before
    a certain date. We paid one lump sum to Mark Batty/ITC for this right years ago
    before he sold the company to Monotype. Because of this deal, as far as I know,
    Linotype does not have to pay ITC any royalties at all for the sales of any of
    these 1000 or so typefaces. <BR> <BR>According to ITC&#39;s terms, Linotype was
    not required to pay the typefaces&#39; designers any royalties on future sales
    either! However, paying royalties, and maintaining good relations with designers
    is very important to Linotype and its employees. So, even though it was not required,
    Linotype voluntarially decided to pay the deigners of these ITC designs royalties
    on the sales of these typefaces. <BR> <BR>I looked in the forum archives, and
    it seems &#40;based on his comments&#41; that Erik thinks that he is not receiving
    royalties from Linotype&#39;s selling of his ITC Officina. I find the idea that
    he wouldn&#39;t be receiving any royalties very troubling, as I have it on very
    good authority that we do pay royalties on the ITC typefaces, so I e-mailed Erik
    offline and asked him to contact Linotype directly &#40;basically anyone other
    than me <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"

    <BR>That went to ITC. What they did with it, I do not know. I think that the company
    was cash starved at the time, and may have needed an infusion just to keep from
    folding all together. Shortly after this sale went through, ITC was sold entirely
    to Monotype, as far as I know. <BR> <BR>I have also heard that Monotype was not

  body: I use exclusive as in &#34;this font is an exclusive of this particular foundry&#34;.
    In other words, the foundry has the exclusive right to sell and market the font.
    If I release a design myself, I have exclusive rights to sell and market the font
    as I wish. Also, custom fonts often include an arrangement were the client gets
    an exclusive on the font for x-number of years, often renewable. The designer
    cannot market the font during the length of the agreement. At the end of the agreement,
    all rights to the font revert to the designer/foundry. Often, after the exclusive
    expires, the designer/foundry will sell the designs as retail fonts. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    just the way I think of the word &#34;exclusive&#34; as it applies to fonts. Sort
    of.

  body: 'I come from a marketing background, and see words like &#34;exclusive&#34;
    overused in all sort of promotional areas, and understand that ITC&#39;s usage
    here is not necessarily illegal - it&#39;s just pushing the envelope to the limit
    for a typically professional product &#40;and conversely is within typically accepted
    standards for consumer products&#41;. <BR> <BR>We have to judge this on simple
    terms. The question needs to be asked: Is this PR statement true? I think that
    the term &#34;exclusive&#34; in this instance hinges on the pretext that it is
    not available from another supplier. The fraud is in the concept that this is
    seemingly not ITC&#39;s primary usage of the word in this PR piece. <BR> <BR>Usage
    of the term &#34;exclusive&#34; here seems to be centered around the notion that
    there is a degree of eliteness to the item, and this is obviously untrue. There
    is nothing limited, aristocratic, preferential, privileged, or private about these
    typefaces. ITC&#39;s use of this term clings to the idea that one cannot purchase
    it from any other reseller than those they authorize &#40;Can anyone say BFD?&#41;.
    Yet anyone from any walk of life can purchase and use these until we are far beyond
    sick of seeing such use. As a result, the hint of a purchase and use of any of
    these typefaces being a semi-monogamous relationship with the designer is pure
    fiction. In the truest sense of the word the word, this company would have the
    greatest results from this product if it were whored! How exclusive is that? <a
    href="http://www.hookerfonts.com" target="_blank">www.hookerfonts.com</a> should
    be a redirect for this blurb. <BR> <BR>Legal? Yes. On the up-and-up? Sorry, no.
    <BR> <BR>In my experience, this sort of exaggeration is rarely limited to one
    PR release or advertisement for a firm. In ITC&#39;s case this is equally true
    as well. One of my favorite examples &#40;besides the obvious Anna roots in Stephenson
    Blakes Casablanca&#41; is in ITC Wisteria, a design whose sole credit is and has
    been falsely given by ITC from the getgo. I quote from their own website:  <BR>
    <BR>&#34;ITC Wisteria was designed by Michael Stacey, a Florida-based artist and
    graphic designer. <BR> <BR>ITC Wisteria was not designed by Michael Stacey, a
    well known fact among many. It is an exacting reproduction of an alphabet design
    copyrighted in multiple 1938 through 1952 popular publications by Ross F. George,
    co-inventor of the Speedball pen. Why companies like ITC like to stretch the truth,
    hide the actual origins, and deceive buyers with ITC Wisteria is perplexing at
    best. They need to go well beyond correcting misleading press releases such as
    the one this thread began with and cleanse their entire staff of personnel and
    material that does not meet the highest standards of forthrightness. <BR> <BR>Lastly,
    I applaud Linotype taking the high road on the ITC rights they hold, and would
    hope that this is a minimum standard that they as well as others apply for similar
    rights as well. However, in doing so, Linotype as well as others have a responsibility
    to correct and amend for ITC&#39;s overzealous and inaccurate credit claims such
    as the one above.'

    clear: there are all sorts of issues for type designers when rights to type libraries
    are transferred or sold. <BR> <BR>In the long run, the only thing to be done is
    to recognize copyright inherent in the design of fonts. This would give the designers
    legal rights that would help immensely in the kinds of situations at issue. But
    this is not an easy thing to accomplish, particularly in the USA. <BR> <BR>In
    the short run, designers might attempt to structure contracts such that the foundry
    paying royalties is unable to sell, license or otherwise dispose of the fonts
    without making provisions in those subsequent contracts that cause the royalties
    to continue. <BR> <BR>Another option is for designers to simply sell their fonts
    outright to foundries at some reasonable rate. Then the foundry is able to do
    whatever it likes with the fonts, both legally and ethically. This transfers the
    sales-volume risk to the foundry &#40;usually better able to average these things
    out across a larger volume of fonts&#41;. On the other hand, it requires that
    the foundry be able to afford to pay for the full value of the fonts up front.
    And of course although the designer is protected from the danger of poor sales,
    and gets money up front, they don&#39;t get to share in the upside if the font
    is a bestseller. So there are tradeoffs. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T'

    <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?72/54802">press release</a>.
    ITC Legacy is never mentioned in the press release or referred to as new or exclusive.

    ITC Anna Extended is a new addition to the ITC Anna family and the release details

    Legacy. It does, however, point the reader to <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/whatsnew_fonts.asp?Newrel=2004">this

    This page displays the featured ITC product of each month. In most cases, the
    featured product is a new typeface release. In other cases, its a new value pack.
    ITC Legacy was featured earlier this year when we introduced the <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sid=0&amp;sku=ITC9254">ITC
    Legacy Complete Family Package</a> - a package containing both sans and serif
