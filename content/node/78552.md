  I recently watched Blue Valentine and I was touched by it. I've cut a GIF animation
  of the film title in the end with that beautiful effect of the photo in the back.
  The typeface reminds me of Knockout by Hoefler & Jones. Is that it? If not, does
  anyone recognize this font?\r\n\r\nThanks! xxx"
