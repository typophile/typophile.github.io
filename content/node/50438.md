  a poster in the style of some sort of design movement. I chose the Cultural Revolution,
  but the thing is, all the type on the original posters is in Chinese! Not knowing
  Chinese, does anyone have any suggestions on either typeface that mimics Chinese
  characters, or probably more likely, some type faces that have that communist blocky
  feel. Maybe like the blocky looking soviet union type, sort of like a more ridged
  Din. Though, at the same time, i don't want it to end up being too Russian/Soviet
  looking. Haha, sorry being so vague.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone! I really appreciate
  it.\r\n\r\n-josh"

    post....\r\n\r\nThe thing is, EVERYONE is doing swiss design, and I wanted to
    do something different.  \r\n\r\nanyway, any suggestions?"

    be kind of obvious, but still, it really does mimic the era in a number of ways...

  body: In fact there are typefaces that imitate chinese letters, but I'm afraid they
    look tacky and amateurish. You could draw the lettering by hand, that's how the
    kids did their posters during the Cultural Revolution.

    movement\u201D.\r\nMe too, the only expression of the CR that I'm aware of out
    of direct control of government design, was the humiliation graffiti, This goes
    back much further than the CR. This was only a small part of the 'movement's design'.
    I think it's a good assignment, but unless the choice of tactics is modified,
    I'm of the opinion that the assignment will be impossible to achieve without looking
    tacky and amateurish. Modified for example, somehow to make the point that this
    was the largest ratio of populous-in-change, to design-in-stasis, in the history
    of mankind. Steven Heller did a presentation on totalitarian design, basically
    Stalin, Hitler and Mao,  at TypoBerlin this year, knows much more about it than
    me, and I believe his book on the topic is out, or will be.\r\n\r\nOther huge
    popular movement choices might be to gather images of really sexy Indian temple
    carvings and show how there are word forms in that movement somewhere, the web,
    or point out the down-to-today stylistic longevity of ancient Egypt. Acid Rock,
    Circus Posters, or go Celtic(s). Depending on who is instructing, your interests...
    hope it helps.\r\n\r\nCheers."

    to mimic style.\r\nJust find a number of examples of your subject, identify visual
    themes, and create a design using those themes. \r\n\r\nYou are right on the money:\r\nhttp://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-168067408.html\r\n"

    they did it. Less chinese but more conceptual."
