  is an extended modern serif and a new companion to insigne\u2019s [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/montag/|Montag]]
  and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/dienstag/|Dienstag]] extended sans serifs.
  Mittwoch conveys a graceful air with its high-contrast letterforms and its ball
  terminals, but also includes some unique touches that are unexpected for modern
  faces. Mittwoch includes four different weights and 50 alternate characters, including
  swashes, more traditional modern letterforms and simplified characters for titling
  or when a more unique look is needed. For complementary companions, be sure to check
  out Montag and Dienstag, also available from insigne.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mittwoch-Poster-2_4303.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mittwoch-Poster-3_5890.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mittwoch-Promo-Page_6421.png]\r\n\r\nwww.insignedesign.com\r\nwww.twitter.com/insignedesign"
