    of <em>Typographie</em>. I also have another of Aicher's obscure books named <em>In
    Rotis</em>, which has nothing to do with the \"super type family\" Rotis, but
    about the mini-think-tank he ran near his residence in Rotis in the Allg\xE4u
    region of Germany. (Both of his books were inscribed to me saying something like
    \"Norbert -- for the time you spent here in Rotis\" or so he said. It probably
    said, \"Nobert -- now go on and get out of here you little doofus!\" since I still

  body: "Someday I will endeavor to write about my experiences with Otl Aicher (which
    for me was wonderful) and about the development of the Rotis type family during
    transitioning from Aicher's studio (he had his own Ikarus system) to Agfa (we
    had to adapt the outlines to our database) which was NOT so wonderful.\r\n\r\nErik
    put it well:\r\n<em>We have a word for that in German: Rotis is a \u201CKopfgeburt\u201D,
    it is born from (by?) the head.</em>\r\n\r\nIf anything, Aicher was a formalist
    in turmoil. A philosopher in spirit who was shackled by his \"sense\" of order.
    He called for revolution in design and typography, but adhered to the grid (anti-nature)
    in distrust of chaos. \r\n\r\nHe admired Adrian Frutiger immensely and one can
    undoubtably see how Univers influenced the Rotis matrix.\r\n\r\nIf one reads deeper
    into Aicher's <em>Typographie</em>, one will see Aicher's concepts as being less
    typographic (relating to type design and type layout) and more involved with humans
    within a rapidly changing environment in need of new symbology and notation systems.\r\n\r\nThere
    are some aspects to the Rotis forms that I find interesting, but most of the weights
    leave me cold... from the first time I saw initial test through the release and
    promotional material.\r\n\r\nBy the time the entire Rotis family was available
    for sale, my job had less to do with type promotion, so I never really spent much
    time setting the faces and learning what unique and usable aspects could be exploited.
    \r\n\r\nI am far more an admirer of Herr Aicher than Rotis the type family (Rotis
    the village was idyllic) and will eventually share more of my experiences and
    learning from Otl Aicher."

      fuer Gestaltung Ulm available:\r\nhttp://www.formundzweck.com/titel.php?20\r\n\r\n(Form+Zweck
      is always beautifully designed, even if it tends to be \r\n'over-designed' sometimes.)
      \r\nIt is in German, but the magazine goes with a CD \r\non which you can find
      an English version as a PDF.\r\nThis issue covers different aspects of the Hochschule
      fuer Gestaltung Ulm\r\nrather than only Otl Aicher.\r\nHowever, there's also
      an article in it about Aicher's illustrations for a book \r\nabout William of
      Ockham.\r\n\r\nThe best introduction to Aicher's design philosophy is in my
      opinion \r\nhis essay 'Die dritte Moderne' ('Third modernism' \r\n- or something
      similar: I only know the German edition)\r\nin 'Die Welt als Entwurf' ('World
      as design').\r\n\r\nAicher's book 'Typographie' is also quite interesting. \r\nHis
      considerations about center axis versus left-ranged title pages and \r\nabout
      the importance of the lower case are worth to be read, to whatever \r\nown conclusion
      the reader might come.\r\n\r\nBTW, Jost Hochuli was quite critical about this
      book \r\n(especially about the design of this book), as one can read \r\nin
      Hochuli 'Designing books' where Hochuli wrote (without mentioning \r\nAicher
      or the title of the book 'Typographie') that functionalism is in danger \r\nof
      becoming a superficial pose if text is printed on ultra-white paper\r\n(which
      creates a too strong contrast and is therefore hard to read) \r\nin a book which
      is almost 2 kilogram heavy. Even if Hochuli did not mention\r\nAicher, at the
      time this text was published first, everybody knew to which book \r\nHochuli
      was referring to. (I do not have 'Designing books' here with me, \r\nI am quoting
      out of my memory. The exact words of this critical comment \r\nshould be in
      'Designing books' somewhere between page 12 and 14.)\r\n\r\nAicher's writing
      is very critical about any style or superficial aesthetics in design \r\nand
      never lacks a certain polemic note.\r\n\r\nThe questions Aicher raises are sometimes
      more interesting than his answers \r\nto these questions. \r\n\r\nIt would be
      a little bit unfair to judge Aicher only by looking at Rotis,\r\nand by doing
      so one would cut oneself off from the opportunity \r\nof coming to know his
      design philosophy which always revolves round \r\nthe question of the designer's
      responsibility. His strong moral point of view \r\nalso traces back from his
      experiences in Nazi-Germany where he was in contact \r\nwith the resistance
      group Weisse Rosearound Sophie Scholl.\r\n\r\nAichers design for the Olympic
      games 1972 (and his pictograms) \r\nbrought him world wide recognition.\r\n\r\nThere
      was a time when Aicher had acquired an almost guru-like status \r\n(especially
      when he just had had been killed by an accident. \r\nUntimely death can boost
      popularity and helps building instant-saints). \r\nThis led of course to a counter-movement
      amongst some designers\r\nwho argued that Aicher had confused ideology with
      design.\r\nUsing or rejecting Rotis was for a certain time  at least in Germany
      \r\nand other German speaking countries - \r\na demonstration whether one was
      pro or contra Aicher.\r\nThis time of hysteria is luckily over. \r\nOne can
      only hope that now Aicher's achievements \r\n(as well as the limitations of
      his approach  are there any? Erik, what do you think?)\r\nin his own design
      works  as well as in his writings can now be discussed \r\nin a more objective

    of design structures/principles) made even clearer \r\nfrom where the menace to
    reasoning came from: from ideology/dogmatism.\r\n\r\nAicher was quite dogmatic
    and articulate about his ideas,\r\nbut this does not mean that the traditionalists
    were less dogmatic.\r\nIt is just that their dogmatism had the force of habit

    all had something to say on this topic. \r\nThe whole chapter 11 in Kinross' 'Modern

    as well as Aicher's remarks on symmetry \r\nin his book 'Typographie' are rooted
    in a long history of conflicts \r\nbetween traditionalists and modernists/functionalists

    also started the process of gathering some of my own personal notes and correspondences
    related to period Aicher was in process of publishing <em>Typographie</em> and
    the development of Rotis type family. My intent is only to fill some critical
    facts which seem forgotten or lacking on the information, theories and criticism
    associated with Rotis. \r\n\r\nIt's important to know that the preparation and
    publishing of <em>Typographie</em> was happening simultaneously with the development
    of the Rotis typefaces. Aicher was commissioned to compile a record of his typographic
    experiences by Klaus Maack of Druckhaus Maack (major printshop in Germany since
    1849), who also happened to be the CEO of <a href=\"http://www.erco.com\" target=\"new\"><strong>ERCO</strong></a>,
    the major high-end lighting manufacturer that Aicher was rebranding (with Rotis).\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\n>
    <em>One thing to remember about Rotis is that it was Aicher\u2019s first font.</em>\r\n\r\nFYI
    -- technically not his \"first\" but in actuality Rotis was his only type design
    effort, due to his untimely death.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.spiekermann.com/iblog/C1109747452/E1829097339/index.html\"
    target=\"new\">spiekerblog -- Erik Spiekermann</a>\r\n\"Aicher certainly didn\u2019t
    do himself a favour by aiming so high with his first proper type design (he had
    previously adapted Univers for Bulthaupt and the Traffic typeface for Munich airport).\""

  body: "I have just finished reading 'typographie' today. I have been working through
    it this last week. First-off, the English translation in Rotis Roman *wasn't*
    difficult to read. It has been the first time I had read Rotis (Roman) in any
    quantity. There is an example in the book later on which shows the comparison
    between Rotis Roman and Times Roman and it becomes clear that Times is a significant
    influence from the Roman end of the scale.\r\n\r\nThe book lays out a *Big* argument
    about the adoption of capitalis by the Romans (and later Renaisance) with the
    usage of Capitalis' drawing an association to vacuous superiority. This is both
    interesting and enlightening as this had not been apparent, though subconsciously
    obvious.\r\n\r\nTypographie, the Book is a fine example of 'Total Design' in the
    true Dutch sense, where all aspects of the design work in a holistic way (typeface,
    illustration style page make-up). The only aspect of the book design that bugged
    me was a really tight gutter margin and some bad column return alliterations.\r\n\r\nI
    have always admired what I have seen of Aicher's work and have his Sahara Desert
    book and essays (English and German) so am looking forward to the book from Markus
    Rathgeb.\r\n\r\nRotis as a font is a remarkable undertaking. I really like the
    concept of legibility being increased upon the increased distinction between letterforms
    and admire the notion of being inspired by pen-forms and early type design, especially
    the Garamond lowercase e (Carolingian minuscule). If we were to take these to
    starting points - would we end up with something so successful as Rotis, perhaps?
    But what is commendable is having the ideas and working them out and creating
    a font programme of 17 variants. It can be criticised but has yet to be superseded.
    I believe this is suggested as the eternal challenge to the typographer anyhow.\r\n\r\nI
    wish I had read it years ago. An important book!\r\n\r\n/hernan"

      the Rotis font. Everything is geared up to this point."
