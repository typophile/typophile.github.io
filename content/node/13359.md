body: Quick question, is there a way to select multiple glyphs and batch convert to
  lines? Or do I have to open each individual glyph in an editing panal, select it,
  right click, go to convert, select lines, then go on to the next glyph over and
  over?

    I do know is this. Select an outline, right-click on the outline, in the context
    menu there is a section with two entries \"convert\" and \"connection\" the sub-menu
    for convert has 3 options:\r\n<code>Convert&nbsp;->&nbsp;To&nbsp;Curves\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To&nbsp;Lines\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To&nbsp;Off-Curve&nbsp;Points</code>\r\nThing
    is, it appears you can only access these options on a per-glyph basis. That's
    what I mean."
