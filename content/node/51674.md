  Life]] logo I tried to update couple weeks back. This one kinda ties in with that
  company. This company sells BEST Life products (Dental, Medical, Vision & Life insurance)
  but needs to look totally different from the BEST Life branding...They wanted to
  keep it two separate identities. Anyway, the name of the company is BEST HEALTH
  PLANS & they currently don't have a logo. Here are 2 options that I came up with.
  Let me know if it works for you guys. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BHP_3862.jpg]"

  body: "Agreed, the top. I think the letter combination is smart. \r\nThe type in
    Best Health Plans leaves a little to be desired, in my opinion. Can we see some
    more options and perhaps some configuration options? Everything feels a bit too
    tall and thin."

  body: "Yes to the gradient in full colour. No gradient will be applied on one colur
    versions anyway... Or flat-only colours...\r\n\r\nGradients give it a very nice
    dimension feel. Can't relate it to anything with this brand but looks nice.\r\n\r\nJust
    wanted to say, that someone not liking the gradient will reflect on end result.
    No offence pennANDink. I didn't want to negate your opinion. I respect it. I just
    wanted to add another opinion, because there was none so far.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

    is behind the wave. I think behind might work better though.\r\n\r\nWhat's with
    the type? Why is the 'E' so much shorter than the other letters? I think you also
    need to work on the position and alignment of the type.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Yes. Correct shadows. Shaded one is the one behind but I also think stem
    in front works better.\r\n\r\nI don't like type yet. Doesn't complement BP. You'll
    have to find another one that will match it better. Top second one was better.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
