  been staring at it for so long that I don't know what looks right anymore (weeks).
  If anyone can give me some pointers or tell me how it looks to them, it'd be appreciated!\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://s296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/gdghent/?action=view&current=karnival.jpg\"

    of k seems almost an error, given the sansiness of all other letters)"

  body: "after staring the same piece of work for too long, I find It helps to turn
    it upside down and look at it from a distance, so you are just looking at the
    relationships of the shapes as they are without thinking about what you want them
    to look like. \r\n\r\nMy 2\xA2: the 'ka' is a problem. Have you tried fudging
    the 'k's arms and legs to even out the upper and lower spaces a little? (prolly
    not gonna work) Or all due respect to Riccardo, maybe keep the 'vi' ligature and
    create a 'ka' ligature."

  body: "I agree with both comments above. The serif on the k seems off. The top right
    arm of the K needs to be closer to the A (ie. same distance as the bottom arm),
    and the \"iv\" looks like it needs to be adjusted. It looks almost like the I
    and the V are different heights and not lining up quite right. \r\n\r\nIf it were
    me, I'd let the i and the v touch, but just as a \"kiss\" and not as a crash.
    I think I would open up the spaces between the \"a r,\" the \"a i\" and the \"a
    l\" just a tad. Right now, they look to be closer together than the \"r n.\" (probably
    an optical illusion). \r\n\r\nIf anything, the \"r n' should be closer together
    due to the counter below the arm of the r.\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts.\r\n\r\nRL"

  body: "This looks better in my opinion, although not perfect. The small serif of
    the k is removed. Ascenders of k and l are higher now. The i has a dot. And the
    distance between i and v is bigger. I dislike especially the missing dot in your
    example, because it looks like a Roman number 4.\r\n\r\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/2756/karnival.gif"

    most humans draw the top and bottom line automatically in their head. If the designer
    draws them, he says, that most of the users are stupid. I know, it was not your
    earnestness, but it even would not work for a heavy equipment company, whatever
    that is."

    work. Just answering Arno's question)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you have drawn, but not to the heaviness of the typeface. But with regard to the
    invested time, you are probably right. On the other side I think, that a well
    chosen font could spare a bit work. I would not have taken just that font.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, the three examples, that you have posted likewise don\u2019t look like
    masterpieces of logos or wordmarks."

  body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for the responses.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to clarify
    first of all that I do understand a logo is more than a pretty font. There is
    more to this logo, which has been removed as I'm not quite ready to reveal it
    to the world (and I'm sure the client would prefer it this way, too). Also, the
    serif on the k is a side effect of my very lazily removing parts of the logo so
    that the focus could be on the type. So long story short - this isn't the logo,
    just the type ripped out of the logo.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate the suggestions...
    off to look at it again, and hopefully get a bit further with it this time.\r\n\r\nLiv"
