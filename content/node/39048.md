body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm not as fluent as much as I'd like to be
  in the anatomy of letters. Here are a few lowercase a's that have interesting characteristics
  that I'm not sure how to describe using the proper jargon. This post is spurred
  on by recent release of Droid from Ascender. It has a peculiar terminal affectation
  that I have seen many times before, but now is the time to learn all about it. Esprit
  is probably the first instance I can think of. There are also other design features
  I'm interested in. Here are the subjects:\r\n\r\n1. DTL Unico\r\nThere is not a
  sharp point in this entire letter (except in the inkwell). Its smooth like it's
  from letterpress. What would a type designer call this global treatment of smooth
  curves?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unico__5474.png]\r\n\r\n2. DTL Dorian\r\nThe
  circled area is the first example in which the terminal looks like a brush stroke
  and comes to a sharp point in the inside of the counter. What are these terminals
  called? The arrow points to an area that has been purposely made bulbous. What is
  that feature called?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dorian__5342.png]\r\n\r\n3.
  Ascender Corp. Droid Serif\r\nThe second example of that terminal treatment. The
  arrow points a slab spur which definitely enhances readability and sturdiness for
  low-res display and printing. Is slab spur the correct term?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/droid__6110.png]\r\n\r\n4.
  Type Culture Latienne\r\nThe third example. The arrow points to an area (spur, tail?)
  that is pointed upwards. What do we call that?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/latienne__4299.png]\r\n\r\n5.
  Linotype Really\r\nThis one looks like it would have been like the others but the
  terminal has been chopped. Just interesting thats all, no question. :-)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LTReally__5171.png]\r\n\r\nThank
  you all for responses,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)\r\n"

    to describe these types of treatments.

    modest foxtail.\r\nLaurentian: foxtail.\r\nEsprit: exaggerated foxtail.\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see I rely on \"foxtail\" a lot, even though I only\r\nheard it recently:
    http://typophile.com/node/46990\r\nI thing it basically means \"cuspy teardrop\",
    which has\r\nbecome the terminal du jour.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
