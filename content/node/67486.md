body: "Hello there, and thank you for giving your time, here is my case :\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on a 'liney' font (I mean that all the characters are connected each others
  by lines, horizontally & vertically) and managed to make it work in Fontlab.\r\n\r\nNo
  problems here, and I'm quite proud of my work!\r\n\r\nWhen I generate the font,
  everythings seems to be okay, and it's working nicely in TextEdit. Kerning, line-spacing,
  hinting are what I expect.\r\n\r\nProblems are coming when I use this font in other
  softwares :\r\n\r\n- Adobe programs (I've tried on Illustrator, Photoshop & InDesign).
  Kerning is working but the line-spacing is higher than what I want, so vertical
  lines are \"disconnected\".\r\n\r\nWhen I saw this, I tried with a non Adobe soft,
  so I've launched iWeb and had a new surprise :\r\n\r\nKerning and Line-spacing are
  higher than what it would be, even if all lines are connected.\r\n\r\nI tried googling
  on this, but didn't find anything to help.\r\n\r\nIf someone here needs extra info
  about my FontLab preferences or anything else, please do.\r\n\r\nThanks by advance
  for your help,\r\n\r\nBernard."

    In other words, if you are working with a 1000 upm, your glyph must have this
    height.\r\n\r\nIn InDesign, verify if the leading equals to the type size. ID
    default is to apply automatic leading with 120% of the type size."
