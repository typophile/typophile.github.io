  body: Is it possible it&#39;s a custom Tankard face? It&#39;s so close to Bliss
    in many ways.

  body: As I&#39;ve been searching I feel convinced that it is a custom job <BR>that
    borrows ideas and forms from other faces, including <BR>Bliss. I don&#39;t think
    it&#39;s Tankard because it isn&#39;t very good.
