    it and Believe it\r\n\r\nI think we are talking of ITC Berkeley Old Style. Which
    by the way, was very popular in publishing in the 1980s.\r\n\r\nAnd johnshandy
    - if you need answers to identify a typeface -for future reference -  if you look
    at the Forums List - there is one called Type ID Board - and folks are very anxious
    to help everytime a new one is posted there. :-) "
