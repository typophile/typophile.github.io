  am writing my dissertation on type classification and I have come across an old
  web log stating this, \r\n\r\nhttps://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&L=typo-l&T=0&P=17656\r\n\r\nI
  found this slightly surprising so I was hoping someone might know something more
  about it and even better have some substantial proof, \r\nI am also looking if anyone
  has any information on Vox in general and especially regarding what prompted him
  to work on the classification \r\nThanks Lou\r\n"

    After all his url's in the listserv link you posted.\r\n\r\nOther people who might
    be able to help;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stbride.org/\r\n\r\nI take it you're aware
    of Catherine Dixon's 2002 St Brides conference address? It was about type classification.\r\n\r\nThe
    other thing that comes to mind in this context is the Wynkyn de Worde Society.\r\n\r\nYou
    could probably look up Vox on both the wikipedia and the French library system.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    Gerard and Francis are spelt M e ynell."
