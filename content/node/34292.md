  advice?\r\n\r\nHow many pieces is a good number?"

  body: "Not only is it \"nice\" to have a paper portfolio as well, I wouldn't expect
    anything less if you have print work (If you just have websites, that's a slightly
    different story). You have to show them in the flesh; after all, it <strong>is</strong>
    print. Two classic approaches are to either get/make a nice container and use
    boards to show off your pieces, or use a book/binder format. I have found boards
    to be quite successful because you can control exactly what the interviewer is
    looking at, whereas if you have a book you will have to think about how the separate
    pieces will interact with each other when you put them on a spread and whether
    or not one is distracting the interviewer from what you're saying. When it comes
    down to it, your physical portfolio should be \"transparent\" in that it allows
    your designs to be seen exactly for what they are with no distractions.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you have logos, <strong>don't</strong> try to save paper and put several on
    a single page. One logo, at size, on one page.\r\n\r\nAs far as number of pieces
    go, the more important principle to follow is to put in only your best work. Convince
    them that you do <strong>great</strong> work, not mediocre work. If you have 3
    pieces that are awesome and 10 that just aren't up to par, use the 3. If you have
    8 that are phenomenal, good for you, but probably no more. I've seen too many
    student portfolios that are filled with junk. Quality, not quantity. As a maximum,
    I would say no more than 8.\r\n\r\nAnd try to tailor the pieces and your presentation
    to what the company does. Know who you're talking to, and study up on what work
    they've done. You'll be a much more legitimate prospect if you show them you actually
    give a crap about what they've done in the past.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    have to SHOW them all once there, but it's good to have them ready.\r\n\r\nAnd
    rethink working for no-pay. ;o)"
