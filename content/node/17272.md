body: "Hello Everyone,\r\nSee attachment: it's [[Freight]] Medium 9 pt tracked at
  0. Great newsy font but generates labyrinth effect in Polish when set in 39 mm columns.
  Already tried a variety of H&Js. This one seems optimal but not satisfying - the
  gaps.. 39 mm column is a must. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nBTW: Does anybody know any newspaper
  in compact format [apart from Independent on Sunday] which uses 6 column grid?\r\nThanx
  in advance.\r\n\r\nknap"

  body: "It seems like that may be more an issue of your column width, and word length,
    rather than an issue with Freight?\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you bring the point
    size down to 8.75 and maybe track it -.5? Maybe a slight change like that could
    help."

    body: "Column width is hard issue - must think about it. \r\nBut look: -0.5 track
      helps! Before I only tried -1. Shame on me -10 years on Quark and didn't know
      that I can fix 0.0 parameters track..] Thanx Chris.\r\nknap[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freight05.jpg]"

  body: 'It looks like you have a double space between by and o in the line that begins:
    by o podczas. Alternately to the tracking you could allow your minimun and optimum
    word spaces to be somewhat more narrow. Its amazing how small you can make the
    word space and still have it look quite good.'

  body: Knap, glad that helped! Sometimes those minute adjustments make a big difference.
    I used to design a newsletter, and the art director would sometimes ask me to
    *gasp* horizontally scale a line of copy  99% or 98% to get it to fit. It was
    an imperceptible change, but it often worked...

  body: Knap, I have designed a newspaper sized 280x360 mm with 6 column grid. Does
    that count as compact-format? What specifically were you interested in?
