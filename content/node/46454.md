  body text. I am personally like to the look and feel of the left or right justified
  text. Can some one give me a tip in Indesign on how to pull it off beatifully. Are
  there any other way apart from  adding hypenation.  I have tried to use justification
  option before but its very complicated.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    the copywriters in bed with you. So to speak. You''ll want to take several articles
    and test several (hundreds?) of fonts before you''ll find the right ratio as well. '
