body: "I have been expanding my Monospace to support Latin-Vietnamese and the the
  Unicode around those points and I have come across the H cedilla & so on. When this
  happened I went back to my C cedilla design and I saw a problem - with a different
  context my Cedilla style doesn't seem to read well enough. I had opted for the simpler
  cedilla thinking that it would translate more readily into pixels at 10-14pt - which
  worked well. Now, with better insight into rendering behavior, trends, and a slightly
  less screen oriented intent I am thinking that a Calibri style might be better.
  But I thought it might be interesting to hear what you all think/feel about this.
  I am open to re-hearing why the full sickle model is best, especially if it comes
  with some screen oriented advice.\r\n\r\nHere are some samples to look at. First
  what I started to think twice about:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cedillaexample_6135.gif]\r\n\r\nand
  then a sampling of Cedillas with Calibri pointed out.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cedilla_5507.gif]"

  body: The Calibri way is the way to go. Incidentally it's the same method I'm using
    on a in-progress typeface for very small rendering.

  body: It seems like it to me too. What are your reasons? Mine have to do with getting
    a more recognizable form that will still play nicely with low rez.

  body: Same here, but it's also the only option for print as the traditional form
    is way too small and delicate to really register in very small size. Also the
    pure stubs as is shown to the left of Calibri can be confused with comma accents,
    so that's not the way to go, and my decenders are very very short so there is
    no room draw complicated forms.

  body: "I agree with what you are saying about the unattached stub.\r\n\r\nI was
    looking at this just now as well.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/diacritics.htm\r\n\r\n<cite>Under
    comma and cedilla\r\nThe under comma is the preferred form in the Romanian language
    for the uppercase characters S and T with under comma accent and lowercase s and
    t with under comma accent. Four new Unicode values have been defined to accommodate
    this preference.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite> Scommaaccent U+0218 ; scommaaccent U+0219
    ; Tcommaaccent U+021A ; tcommaaccent U+021B\r\nThe connecting cedilla is the preferred
    form in the Turkish language for the uppercase S with cedilla and lowercase s
    with cedilla:</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Scedilla U+015E ; scedilla U+015F\r\nAn under
    comma is an acceptable alternative to a connecting cedilla for the following characters:</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Ccedilla
    U+00c7 ; ccedilla U+00e7 ; Kcedilla U+0136 ; kcedilla U+0137</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Lcedilla
    U+013b ; lcedilla U+013c ; Ncedilla U+0145 ; ncedilla U+0146</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Rcedilla
    U+0156 ; rcedilla U+0157 ; Tcedilla U+0162 ; tcedilla U+0163\r\nNote : In the
    Portuguese and Catalan languages the traditional connecting style of a cedilla
    is more commonly preferred for the Ccedilla U+00c7 and ccedilla U+00e7.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>It
    is common in modern designs and French typography to see a cedilla design with
    a stroke that is not connecting or as in common handwriting, a line that passes
    through the bottom or beneath the uppercase or lowercase c.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>A
    good solution for these differences would be a language dependant substitute glyph
    for the Ccedilla U+00c7 and ccedilla U+00e7.</cite>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/frenspan_6006.gif]\r\n\r\n<cite>Additional
    note : Recently some type designers have been designing a hybrid form of an under
    comma or cedilla. This takes the shape of the lower portion of the connecting
    cedilla and is used beneath any base character which has an open base as on the
    uppercase R, K, k, N and n. </cite>\r\n\r\nSee also \r\n\r\nhttp://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=8\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedilla\r\n"

  body: "From Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n<cite>Many languages add a diacritical comma (virgula)
    to various letters, such as \u0219, \u0123, and \u0137. These marks resemble cedillas,
    and some sources consider them to be cedillas, but they are officially considered
    commas. This is particularly confusing for characters which can adopt both diacritics:
    for example, the consonant /\u0283/ is written as \u015F in Turkish but \u0219
    in Romanian, and Romanian writers will sometimes use the former instead of the
    latter because of insufficient font or character-set support.</cite>\r\n\r\nSome
    OpenType language specific alternatives should fix that..."
