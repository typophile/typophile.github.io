  body: Richard,  <BR> <BR>Admittedly, it&#39;s sometimes hard to guess which Script
    Guide section applies, but I would have put that font in Part 11 &#40;Everyday
    Hand-printing&#41;. When the choice is ambiguous &#40;in my estimation&#41; I
    put the samples in every section that might fit it, in order to increase the odds
    of finding it.
