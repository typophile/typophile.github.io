    a logo standard back in the 60s and been much better off.

  body: "This logo is a shame.\r\n\r\nOK, it is beautiful, nicely done and quite good
    on colours (although it suffers when used in B&W). But the worst is it's a plagiarism.\r\n\r\nThe
    dancing circle can be seen in William Blake's <em>Oberon, Titania and Puck</em>,
    from 1786, which served as reference to Matisse's <em>Dance</em> in 1910. The
    dancing circle is worldwide known and was already used in Telluride Foundation
    logo. This logo was itself also copied in 2004, in a Bahia's carnival mark.\r\n\r\nI'm
    pretty sure the creators of Rio 2016 (T\xE1til agency) know these references and
    former usage of a dancing circle, especially Matisse's paint and Bahia's logo.
    In their site, they claim to have done a very elaborated and highly creative work
    (!). No mention was made about all these antecedents.\r\n\r\nBesides the plagiarism,
    there is also the \"friendly\" overused idea. As Babs pointed, there is a kind
    of obsession to picture Brazil as a paradise of friendship in sunny beaches. This
    is a bad tendence that our own designers like to propagate, producing a quite
    sterile and repeating aesthetics.\r\n\r\nAnd one cannot forget that Olympic Games
    actually have almost nothing to do with friendship between nations. It's plain
    competition. Coubertin advocated it as an oportunity to fair, edifying disputes
    between men in order to achieve longer, stronger and taller results, always within
    high spirits. But even he did not conceived the Games as a love and pace apotheosis.
    So, the idea behind this logo is also unreal and maladjusted."

    screen prints on clothing, which are pretty low-fidelity media. This logo, as
    shown above would likely be mangled unmercifully when reproduced as an applique
    on a hat or a jacket.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do think this design could easily be tailored
    to create versions that will work for hats and tee-shirts as well as for black
    & white & low-res requirements such as the cardboard boxes the merchandise is
    shipped in and for faxes. It would be surprising if this hasn't been taken into

    these days many graphic designers & their clients aren't as concerned about how

    by color media such as the internet, television,  etc, and when they need printed
    pieces they print in color.  If their logo looks crummy on a fax or xerox, it's
    not a big deal to them since that's not how most consumers will see their logo.\r\n\r\nI'm

    With something as big as the olympics, undoubtedly a lot of people had their hands

    can be.\r\n\r\nI love Montreal 1976. I was only 5 years old but I remember the
