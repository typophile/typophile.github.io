  body: I was using Fontexplorer X (from Linotype) and it was fantastic. New computer
    at work is locked down, so I can't reinstall. And at home I use Windows. I've
    been looking for a home solution, but after using Fontexplorer X, no program I
    have tried is satisfying.

  body: I've been working on Macs since 91. First mostly with SuitCase, which was
    all right. Later came ATM which was also ok. But now I find that Mac's standard
    installed Font Catalog in OSX is pretty awful, so I use FontAgent Pro with much
    pleasure!

    before that. Notice the break on account of the transition to OS X?

  body: "@JamesM, I've been looking at that one. It looks awesome but the price tag
    is a little much for me. Its probably got the value but I don't know if my wallet
    can take care of that now.\r\n\r\n@bert_vanderveen, I guess the same applies.
    I think all great font management programs are right at $100"

    are some installers around, but could be that the free versions don\u2019t work
    on OS X (Snow) Leopard."
