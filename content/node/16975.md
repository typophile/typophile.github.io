body: "Hello typophilers \r\nI work on a corporate identity and have to make the guide.\r\nSince
  it has to be in english and this is not my mother tongue,\r\nI need to have some
  samples. I did a little research,\r\nbut I am not satisfied. Also I realized that
  there is no\r\nstandard in terminology. For example I found those 3 descriptions:\r\nlogo=symbol+signature,
  Mark=symbol+namestyle and mark=symbol+logotype. \r\nSo if anyone has some good examples
  please do let me know.\r\n\r\nI send you the logo (?) which will be in both french
  and English (!!!) \r\nso you can suggest the proper description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchristos"

    signature.\r\n\r\nAIGA has a PDF of their identity guidelines here: http://www.aiga.org/resources/content/1/0/5/1/documents/ID_Guidelines.pdf\r\n\r\nLook
    at page 6 where it explains how to use the various signatures.\r\n\r\nGreat logo
    by the way. I love bi- and multilingual identities."
