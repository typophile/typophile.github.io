body: "Hello everyone!\r\n\r\nI have a question:\r\nI've search for lot of materials
  and books on design, but still have no satisfactory answer at all. Opinions differs,
  so I ask yours!\r\n\r\nProblem: position of the picture in the text on the page
  and it's relation to the baseline grid and text, In the case of modular grid. \r\nNow
  I found two general opinions:\r\n\r\n1)\r\nThe bottom always is standing on the
  baseline, and the top is on the mean line (x-hight).\r\n\r\n2)\r\nThe bottom is
  standing on the desent line, and the top is on the ascender line (Caps hight).\r\n\r\nWhat
  you think about it?\r\n\r\nMaybe there are straight solutions, or reasoned opinions.\r\nThank
  you"

  body: The image resolution messed this up, but the top is cut at cap height. I rarely
    design anything with so thin borders between text and images though.

  body: "Why I chose to align images with the caps? Because ascenders and letters
    at x-height make up the most of any line, and they are rather different in height
    \u2013 I figured something in between would make sense."

  body: "Thank you, \r\nI understand. \r\nI'm from Russia, and in Cirillic typography
    there are very few ascenders (so Cirillic lower case looks like small-caps), so
    we have a line mostly in x-hight.\r\nSo the idea is the same, but with some differences."
