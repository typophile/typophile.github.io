    or do you all just collectively know the font styles?

  body: "There are \"favourites\" of each on of us that we recognize at a single glance
    (or possibly with some educated google-fu guess to loosen up a few neurons ;-).\r\n\r\nI
    recognize most classics by eye from around the period 1970-1990. This particular
    font is 50 years old -- early '60s --, but it was *hugely* popular in the late
    seventies as well.\r\n\r\nIt's an annoying habit. Walk with me down a shopping
    street and I'll go \"Arnold Boecklin .. Optima .. wossthat, Frutiger? .. Peignot
    ..\" Scares the hell out of people who can't discern Arial from Comic Sans."
