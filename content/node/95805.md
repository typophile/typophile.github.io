  short texts in English and in Arabic.\r\nThe texts are printed on big panels (107x72cm)
  and the Arabic text will sit under the English text.\r\nI am using Baskerville Pro

  help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Nope, Lorus is more classical Naskh with wider selection of ligatures, though
    I don't generally like it as many of it ligatures are poorly constructed, and
    it it quite anemic any way.

  body: "What are the texts? At what size will the type be set? Are you using the
    text font of Storm's Baskerville, or the display font?\r\n\r\nThe Arabic script
    is traditionally writting with a broad nib reed pen, and the typical stroke modulation
    of the letters expresses this, as do most typefaces. Baskerville's stroke modulation
    is based on the flexible split nib, so my first question to you would be how committed
    are you to using Baskerville? There are a lot of Latin types that would easily
    harmonise with a range of Arabic types, and almost no Arabic types that harmonise
    easily harmonise with Baskerville. If you were to pick a Latin type with a stroke
    modulation modelled on a broad nib, e.g. anything from Italian romans to French
    mannerist or Dutch baroque types, or any number of recent designs, you would find
    your Arabic choice much more flexible and would be more easily able to select
    companions based on relative colour on the page."

  body: "Thank you very much for all your answers!\r\nand sorry for my late response.\r\n\r\nI
    have to use Baskerville (text), I have no other choice.\r\n\r\n>John Hudson\r\nThe
    size of the type is 150pt on a 107x72cm panel.\r\n\r\n>Aratypo.net\r\nHere is
    an example of the text set (it can't be changed). The Arabic text would sit instead
    of the Mandarin text. The Arabic text should be a bit smaller than the English
    text (I haven't decided how small, any advice is welcome) and the final will be
    done in letterpress.\r\nI'm not fond of Lotus Linotype, though. Someone suggested
    me Adobe Arabic: is it a good typeface?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Food_6005.jpg]"

  body: If we define Baskerville as a model of writing with high contrast in stroke
    and with expansion of contrast (as Noordzij explains it), and we don't think about
    how it is produced using a medium, we could come up with a similar style in arabic
    writing, which one of them is Nastaliq. Thickness of stroke in Nastaliq is controlled
    with pen pressure and tilting the pen. It might seem that the style could not
    fit with Baskerville but there is another typeface which is based on this discipline
    (expansion of contrast) and also could be matched with a latin typeface like Baskerville
    and that is Harir typeface.
