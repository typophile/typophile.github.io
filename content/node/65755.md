  I don't think I ever saw ligatures used in a TV commercial before. The whole ad
  is done very well, and this is one of many nice touches in it. \r\n\r\nThough the
  cheese itself I don't like :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oka-commercial_4656.jpg]"

  body: I might've seen "fi" lig in an ad before. Thing is, it's hard to tell in many
    typefaces if it's the lig or actually two adjacent letters. It looks nice. The
    line might be drawn at "ct" or "st" ligs, outside of commercials calling for Renaissance
    or pirate overtones. Thanks for sharing. :)

  body: Here come the OpenType features in graphic design. Also watch the kerning
    in "Ta".

  body: "I wonder if the lack of typographic sophistication on TV ads is due to the
    tools being used to generate the text. It would be easy to point the finger at
    Adobe but there's probably more to it than that?\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'I think that lack <em>is</em> due to those tools as long as they do not do
    automatic glyph replacement or proper kerning <em>by default.</em> Only few designers
    in TV advertising will see these as that important as to switch them on manually.
    If they know about them in the first place. '

  body: Also, think about signs. Alot of the time, display text is relatively even
    spaced so as to be legible and straightforward. I'm thinking of letter boards
    outside a church or movie theater. Most of those are majuscule-only anyways. But
    then you've got cursive script on wedding invitations and wine bottles replete
    with ligatures, swashes, and what have you. Ah the beauty of diversity!
