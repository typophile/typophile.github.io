  body: "My first thought was that it was one of the Shades fonts from H&FJ, but Topaz
    doesn't have the same C shape. I think you may be right that it is Gotham, which
    does have this C, made to look like an inline. It's easy in Illustrator to create
    an inline look. Could be other sans with this shape C. Avenir black, for example
    looks close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
