  \ Its great stuff-- and I use it constantly.  However, I'm thinking that its mislabeled.
  \ I can't find any listing anywhere for a font called \"metroline\"-- and the ones
  with similar names look NOTHING like my type.  Perhaps the experts here might recognize
  it.  A printed sample is at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.magicfishpress.com/eric/metroline.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  don't know who the type founders might have been, either.  No markings and no original
  packaging.\r\n\r\nGood luck!  Thanks for having a look!\r\n\r\neric wilcox\r\nmagic

    looks like you nut quadded the interword spacing here. (?)\r\n\r\nGerald"

    only one that I know of online is at Briar Press\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oneart.com/cgi-bin/briarpress/show.cgi?db=pin&uid=default&display=1&file=pin_marks-introduction&layout=default\r\n\r\nIn
    most cases, Monotype will not have a pinmark. Off hand I can only think of two
    Monotype operations that pinmarked their type, Baltimore Type Foundry and Phoenix
    Type Foundry.\r\n\r\nAnd, to make it more confusing, not all firms casting foundry
    type (as opposed to Monotype) had pinmarks.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "Richard \r\n\r\nThe second part of this has to do with nicks and feet. While
    there are certain general casting practices, there are far too many variables
    involved to use either of these as positive identification. Examples:\r\n\r\nIn
    many cases Monotype might have no feet, in others it may have, depending upon
    the type of Monotype caster. On the other hand, foundry, which often has distinct
    feet, as this is actually how the jet is removed, doesn't always have them either.
    European metal foundry that has been ground to Anglo-American type height is easily
    identifiable as the feet have been ground off and the grinding pattern is usually
    discernible. But even here, several American firms that licensed European fonts
    often cast them at type high with feet or made special arrangements to have them
    cast that way at the foreign foundry.\r\n\r\nMetal type technology is as much
    of a mess in its variations as the continual evolution of digital type formats.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "Eric\r\n\r\nSorry to have lost this thread. It sort of quickly went off the
    charts. An old rule of thumb in traditional typography was that the width of interword
    spacing should be about the width of a lowercase i.\r\n\r\nBy traditional typography
    I am talking twentieth century. Nut quadding was a common practice of the nineteenth
    century as, or so the common wisdom tells it, the compositors got paid by the
    nut. So, of course, they nutted everything out. \r\n\r\nThe lowercase i width
    was concocted by the typographic revivalists as based on their perception of renaissance
    printing practices (which were themselves based on scribal practices). This is
    hardly common practice today but it does allow for a nicer setting to \"the page.\"
    \r\n\r\nPoetry should be set a bit wider but your sample is much too wide as it
    does not allow for easy continuous reading. Many \"beginners\" will do this. Last
    week I watched as an instructor of digital typography set his first line of metal
    type. He friggin quadded everything. Something about metal. . ."
