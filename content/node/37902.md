body: "Hi all.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about creating a logotype for multiple brands.
  Let me be more specific:\r\nI must create a logotype not associated to anything(!?!).\r\nIt
  will be use in handdryers, ladies brushes or even bandages (!?).\r\nThe brand name?
  Not sure but something like \"metaline\".\r\nThe ideia is to \"develop\" this new
  concept: logotype not associated to anything.\r\nCan this work? how ? ideias? suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

    the problem/opportunity is that your logotype shouldn\u2019t be specific to one
    product \u2013 many brands do this, some use a strapline so \u2013 \r\n\r\n<strong>Metaline</strong>\r\n<em>handdryers</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Metaline</strong>\r\n<em>bandages</em>\r\n\r\nOther
    approaches might use colour or shape to separate the strands of a brand. \r\n\r\nFrankly
    though, it is not a new concept, these products are not so diverse they seem to
    be the kinds of things one might find in a pharmacy or clinic. Many retail chains
    have own brand products or carry a range of products from one supplier.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Hi tim\r\n\r\nThanks for your input.\r\nWell... when I said that the \"this
    new concept\" I real wanted to say \" this new concept to me\" (first time) :-).
    \r\nYes the medical disposables industry uses a lot this concept...\r\nHmm...\r\nI
    had ideais similiar to yours:\r\n1- strapline, possible\r\n2- Color. Good ideia
    but this represents a printing problem. I have to stick to 2 colors already used
    (PMS 179/PMS 343).\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"
