body: I&#39;m building a product showcase with Flash that is translated into multiple
  languages. The translations are handled with Text files. e.g., we send the files
  to Poland, and all the dealer needs to do is open up a text file, translate the
  text and voila, they have a Polish version of the showcase. Easy-peasy. <BR> <BR>The
  problem we&#39;re running into is that the showcase uses our corporate font &#40;Frutiger&#41;.
  We embed the font&#39;s outlines in the Flash file, but when someone needs language-specific
  characters, some of the content comes up missing. If we switch the font to Verdana
  &#40;or any basic system font&#41;, most everything seems to show up &#40;from the
  small amount of testing we&#39;ve done&#41;. <BR> <BR>Now my question, is it possible
  to embed an OpenType version of Frutiger and expect it work in multiple languages?
  Is there a better way to support multiple languages?
