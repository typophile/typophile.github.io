body: 'Has anyone had any problems with missing fonts in iOS Mavericks? I read about
  issues on an Apple forum. I probably need to upgrade soon. I am using FontExplorer,
  not FontBook. One forum suggested a converter program like FontXChange that converts
  fonts to Open Type but I''m really leery of messing with things. '

    you go to Font Book, and just turn the fonts on."

  body: Both of those threads are from last November when Mavericks was new, and it's
    also possible that subsequent upgrades have resolved these issues. I never upgrade
    right away for this reason.
