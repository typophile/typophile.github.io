  I'm not sure if this is the best typeface to use. Thanks so much for your feedback!

  body: "I think the font looks very generic, almost default, plus the type size is
    way too small  for a masthead. \r\n\r\nAddress those issues and I think your newsletter
    'rss' will be a winner."

  body: "The typeface itself does not seem particularly inappropriate, but I'm not
    sure the entire graphic integrates very well.\r\n\r\nWhat newsletter is it? The
    way it is now, it looks more like a logo for a cake shop. It may be an idea to
    post an image of how it appears on the page.    "
