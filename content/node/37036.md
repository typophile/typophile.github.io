    CS Premium Suite for $75, etc.\r\n\r\nThe big boys, no doubt, will be checking
    into this."

    like a new trend in piracy, with dotcom domains blatently selling all kinds of
    stuff that you'd think they'd be low-profile with. Not a good thing."

    don't need to be spreading the word for the pirates. Especially on a site where
    so many of our users are making some or all of their income creating the fonts
    that these guys are stealing.\r\n"

    all respect to you Paul---aww give Dennis a break. Chiding him for his contribution
    is like making excuses for not putting your foot down when it counts. If typophile's
    moderators have any real guts at dealing with piracy, threads like this that link
    to pirated font sources would be simply be deleted without discussion.\r\n\r\nThere's
    nothing to discuss. Just get rid of it. There is no excuse for strealing fonts,
    and there is no excuse for not deleting posts by those who support it.\r\n\r\nMy
    point: be firm but fair. Trust everyone but cut the cards.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    as the location at which they found the information to begin with .... that is
    what matters. I might be pretty hardcore about this stuff, but there is just no
    other way to be. If anyone here finds something they deem questionable email me.
    I have contact with many foundries and can get the information to the right people.
    \r\n\r\nBut please don't post it here. Typophile has managed to stay pretty clean
    and if I have anything to say about it it will remain clean. "

  body: Oh, and I don't apologize for removing links, I just remove them. It isn't
    new that we don't support piracy so having a link removed shouldn't surprise people
    and if it does don't take it personally. And, you can always email the moderators
    to ask why.

    fair enuff. I just happen to think that discussion of font piracy usually goes
    in circles, altho this one has proven an exception.\r\n\r\nTiffany, I appreciate

    People wonder, but not everyone knows where to go unless they start wasting a
    lot of time searching. Let's make it just a bit harder to pirate for both the
    experts and the naifs, shall we?"
