  body: "Already tried to identify it when [[http://typophile.com/node/95227|you asked
    it]] before and it came to nothing, many similars but no match. May be it would
    not be hazardous to consider it is a custom lettering which surely makes sens
    when we know we're talking about the fashion industry. Actually, if you look at
    it carefully, some details look unbalanced, a bit clumsy, may be the result of
    a customization: /R bowl and leg, /C top and bottom terminal, many serifs.\r\nEven
    if I clearly understand you're after the real deal, here are some alternatives:
