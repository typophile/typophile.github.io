body: "I'm on a Mac, though I used to have lots of Windows machines, and still have
  one real and several virtual Windows machines.\r\n\r\nAmong my thousands of uninstalled
  fonts are dozens of (mostly crappy) TTF fonts that have different file names, and
  have corresponding font names when listed in Windows, but are all listed as \"New\"
  in Mac OS X. I used ftxdumperfuser to dump the name table of one of them, and found
  table entries with type IDs 1 through 7, with the Microsoft platform names in platform
  ID 3 all filled in, but the Macintosh names in platform ID 1 all containing default
  values.\r\n\r\nIf the fonts all have the same name I can't even view them in a font
  viewer. What's the easiest way (using free tools) to copy all seven names from platform
  ID 3 to platform ID 1 in all the fonts?\r\n\r\nFontForge might be able to do it
  in batch mode, but it would want to rewrite the whole font, including the glyph
  definitions, and it would complain at great length about the crappy outlines. Perhaps
  I could write a PERL script to edit the XML files, use a shell script to run it
  on all the files, and then use ftxdumperfuser to write the name table back into
  the files. Has such a script been written already?"

    cut here\r\n</PRE>\r\nIf you save that script in an executable file <code>adjnames</code>,
    then <code>adjnames font.ttf</code> creates a font <code>font_new.ttf</code> with
    the adjusted mac names.\r\n\r\nWith a simple find, you can then batch process
    all your files."

  body: "Thank you, Michel, for pointing me in the right direction. AFDKO Python is
    the way to go.\r\n\r\nBut there is a bug in your script, and I need an enhancement.
    I hope you can point me to documentation for Python and for its AFDKO extensions.\r\n\r\nThe
    bug is that in the first table entry, for Copyright, the value is entered in the
    Macintosh version as \"Copyright\" instead of the name of the copyright holder
    as shown in the Windows version of the entry.\r\n\r\nThe enhancement is that some
    of the files (I just chose another arbitrarily) have more than seven table entries,
    and the extra table entries don't have any Macintosh version at all. It would
    also be nice if the script could go through the whole folder of TTF files, operating
    only on the ones that have either no Macintosh entry for the name or have \"New\"
    as the Macintosh name.\r\n\r\nI could do it myself if I understood the language.
    Unfortunately, the only programming languages I ever learned to use were Fortran,
    C (without the ++) and BASIC. But I could learn another."

  body: "The fact that some entries may be present for Windows and not for the OS
    X adds some difficulties. New records need be created. Moreover, if you create
    a record where there is already one, you get two records for the same parameters
    (I checked with TTX); that is probably not good. \r\n\r\nThe only documentation
    I could find is on the Microsoft site and I found snippets with Google. Not fantastic.
    Here is some improved code that handles missing records for the mac and takes
    care of the US English language. This time, the font file is overwritten. That
    means that if you put that script in your path and call it <code>adjmacnames</code>

      has to include 0 (zero) in order to overwrite the Copyright entry.\r\n\r\nBetter
      yet: omit the list of \"idstocopy\" and the corresponding \"if\" statements;
      the script will overwrite any existing Macintosh entries and do nothing if the
      Macintosh entry does not exist.\r\n\r\nHowever: I will avoid complications and
      not try to create new Macintosh entries. The fonts won't be distributed outside
      my own computer and I don't need to have the designer, license, etc. in Mac
      format. Really, all I need is distinct names. Thanks anyway. In fact, thanks
      very much. You've been a great help.\r\n\r\nI still don't understand the import

    of them still not properly named for the Mac.\r\n\r\nAt that point, doing what
    works (even if it has to be done one file, one parameter at a time) is more efficient
    than trying to tweak a batch method. I went into Windows NT on a virtual machine
    and used Font Monster.\r\n\r\nFont Monster assigns one parameter at a time, but
    CTRL-C, CTRL-V made it easy to copy the MS values to the Mac parameters. Other
    than that, its main drawback is that (having been last updated in 1994) it doesn't
    do long file names. Since all the faulty font files have 8.3 file names (probably
    dating from the same period) that wasn't much of a problem."

  body: "Good that you got it right.  Incidentally, there was also a way with FontForge,
    provided FontForge does what you want with the naming table. The idea is just
    to open your font, say <code>font.ttf</code> and generate a new ttf font, say
    <code>newfont.ttf</code> with fontforge. You can then extract from it the name
    table using ttx wich comes with AFDKO; the call\r\n<pre>\r\nttx -t name newfont.ttf\r\n</pre>\r\ngenerates
    the file <code>newfont.ttx</code> wich contains only the generated naming table.
    You can then merge that table into the original font, so that only the naming
    table is modified.\r\n<pre>\r\nttx -m font.ttf newfont.ttx\r\n</pre>\r\ngenerates
    the font <code>newfont#1.ttf</code> which is <code>font.ttf</code> with the new
    merged name table.\r\nOf course that process can be done in batch provided you
    can call fontforge from the line command (which is the often the tricky part).
    \r\n\r\nHere is a script that does it provided the Python fontforge files are
    installed for python2.7 (the one I am personally using with FontForge) and you
    have <code>ttx</code> installed.\r\n<PRE>\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\n# given as parameter
    font.ttf\r\n# generates font_new.ttf \r\n# with mac entries copied from\r\n# the
    win entries George Williams \r\n# considered relevant\r\n\r\npython2.7 &lt;&lt;EOF\r\nimport
    fontforge\r\nf=fontforge.open(\"$1\")\r\nf.generate(\"$1\"[:-4]+\"_new.ttf\")\r\nEOF\r\nttx
    -t name \"${1%.ttf}\"_new.ttf\r\nrm \"${1%.ttf}\"_new.ttf\r\nttx -m \"$1\" \"${1%.ttf}\"_new.ttx\r\nrm
    -f \"${1%.ttf}\"_new.ttx\r\n</PRE>\r\nIf the fontforge package is installed for
    your default python, then call <code>python</code> instead of <code>python2.7</code>."

    body: "Now that you mention it, Michel, I could have used FontForge without ttx.
      When FontForge opens a .ttf it copies the outlines exactly. When I generate
      a font I usually have the Validate box checked, but if I uncheck it and tell
      FontForge to generate a TrueType font it will (I think) simply spit out whatever
      outlines it read in. If it upgrades other tables, like hints or kerning, I wouldn't
      object. As I said, these are mostly crappy fonts.\r\n\r\nI did that with one
      font. The output looked the same as the original in the (low res) Font Book
      preview (bad spacing included), and the files were the same size (as reported
      in Kbytes). Font Monster, FontForge, and your Python script with \"ignore\"
      all ignored the 0099 character in the original Trademark field (which I identified
      because FontForge displayed it with little numbers).\r\n\r\nNext time...."
