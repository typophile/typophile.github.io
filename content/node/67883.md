  body: Looks familiar to me, too, and I also can't place it. It does look very much
    like it was based on Futura Condensed. Where is it from?

  body: The cover is by <a href=http://bookcoverarchive.com/book/a_wolf_at_the_table>Chip
    Kidd</a>, in case someone knows his typical typographic repertoire. You can see
    the (blurry) lowercase at <a href=http://bookcoverarchive.com/spend_generously/a_wolf_at_the_table>Amazon</a>.
    I tried Identifont with the upper and lowercase, but to no avail.

  body: Yeah, DTL Nobel was the closest I got. The S shape made me think it could
    be Century Gothic Condensed, but no such thing exists.
