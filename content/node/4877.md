  BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m thinking about turning someone dear&#39;s handwriting
  into a font. Their writing is averagely cursive so at this point, I&#39;m not quite
  sure how much each letterform will be designed to lead onto the next. I&#39;ve never
  designed a font of this nature before so any advice would prove invaluable. <BR>
  <BR>thanks!
