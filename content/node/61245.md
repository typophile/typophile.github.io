  but I was just made aware of this news: http://www.lohud.com/article/20090821/NEWS02/908210360/-1/newsfront\r\n\r\nI
  did have the good fortune to meet Ed at Typecon a few years back and celebrate his
  birthday with him. . . He was a very kind soul and always in great spirits.\r\n\r\nOne
  of my favorite memories of him: http://www.houseind.com/movie/\r\n\r\nAlso, if you
  get a chance pick up a copy of his book Life with Letters as the Turned Photogenic,
  a wonderful tome that recounts the history of his company and life . . .\r\n\r\nHe
  left and indelible mark on the type industry and will be sorely missed . . .\r\n\r\nStuart"

    he left an indelible impact on the typographic world.\r\nI remember him as a gentle
