  body: "Eric, that's actually one of ours, 'Vacant'\r\n\r\nhttp://www.reservesca.com/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=73\r\n\r\nWere
    about to release an updated version with a greatly expanded character set to include
    more languages and along with that a few revisions. Afterwards, were going to
    build out additional weights of it and it will be available through other distributors,
    along with a lower price for the single weight and eventually in packages of multiple
    weights.\r\n\r\n"
