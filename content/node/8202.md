body: There have been a lot of very nice typefaces released in the past couple of
  years and it seems like the number of grunge/badly drawn typefaces is waning. <BR>
  <BR>Has this been influenced by the design market wanting different/better products?
  Is it related to changing styles? Do you think that the digital fontmaking craze
  that Macs/PCs/fontographer brought about is over? <BR> <BR>It seems to me there
  is still experimentation going on but it has shifted from &#34;How illegible can
  we make this?&#34; to making more technically enhanced and feature-packed fonts.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to hear what everyone thinks. Hopefully this topic isn&#39;t
  too outdated yet.

  body: The legibility debate seems to be so over. The little voice in the back of
    my head says, &#34;that is so 1999,&#34; but the current movement has been building
    up speed since at least 1994. I don&#39;t know.  <BR> <BR>If the point of the
    moment is trying to figure out how many features can be packed into one font,
    then we still have a long way to go, as the current crop of tricked-out OT latin-based
    fonts only has two members to choose from.

  body: As long as there are design schools and new students attending those schools
    there will be more people wanting to know more about type design. Think about
    how often we get new threads repeating old questions about the technology. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;d take a stab and guess that House Industries has had a huge influence
    on the sway away from the total grunge. If you look at there library&#39;s timeline
    you can see that they have been moving toward cleaner, more perfect, letterforms.
    Maybe they are unique, but I think that is also why they are ahead of the curve.
    Of course this is talking display and so maybe not answering your question.

  body: I&#39;ve always been a fan of clean, electro fonts, so I can&#39;t really
    say that grunge fonts are dying out - I rarely get to use them in my work. <BR>
    <BR>But out of the whole discussion - isn&#39;t design all about progression and
    recycling. After all designers are constantly cutting and pasting and reforming,
    no matter what field of design you&#39;re in. &#40;As I&#39;m sure you all know.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I just always look forward to new design &#40;or rehashed&#41; no matter
    where it&#39;s going.

    during the &#34;transition&#34; all they did was basically abandon ship. It&#39;s
    only since then that their work has become notable, although as Paul Shaw remarked
    in his superb review of House in Print magazine something seems to have been lost
    as well - although it can always be regained, and with some of the stuff we saw
    this year maybe it already has. <BR> <BR>Matthew, I think mainly what happened
    at first was a natural ignorant over-enthusiasm with the so-called &#34;democratization&#34;
    of type design. Then some of the well-meaning hooligans left and some others got
    serious, coupling their creativity with good craft. I think it&#39;s become really
    quite a promising time right now in type design. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    <a href="http://www.houseindustries.com">House</a> has been producing &#40;and
    promoting&#41; OpenType fonts since 2001 -- essentially all of our fonts since
    the Las Vegas Font Collection have been shipped in OpenType format. The features
    in these fonts have become increasingly complex over the <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=SIMIAN-FO&amp;sub=features">last</a>

    <BR>I think the question would be what constitutes &#34;tricked-out,&#34; but
    at the very least there are four families &#40;Ed Interlock, Zapfino Pro Contextual,
    Caflisch Script Pro and Bickham Script Pro&#41;. <BR> <BR>Interestingly, the typefaces

    that we know you&#39;re here I hope you also feel compelled to participate outright.  :-&#62;
    <BR> <BR>BTW, does anybody really think House is washed up? The worst thing I
    for one would say is that you&#39;re just less innocent now - part of growing
    up &#40;typographically speaking&#41;. And the fonts are certainly way better
    now. <BR> <BR>Oh, and I totally agree about the Size Matters complex of late.
    To me there&#39;s something unhealthy in the &#34;never use the same glyph twice&#34;
    mentality for example. The stuff of yours that you showed at TypeCon is much more
    to my own liking, although still maybe a touch too mechanical/predictable to fully
    compete with the &#34;real thing&#34;. The question is, at what point of complexity
    do you cross over into &#34;worth faking&#34;? House may have already crossed
    that line, although the closer you [try to] come to handwriting &#40;as opposed
    to lettering&#41; the farther the line escapes. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Tal, sorry for rounding down to such a small number. Ed Interlock is indeed
    wicked cool, and certainly qualifies as being tricked-out. And I also think that
    the just-released Bello counts, too, if we are counting tricked-out latin fonts.
    So, at the moment we have between five and ten. I suspect that by this time next
    year, we will probably have closer to 100. So, instead of this being the end of
    an era, maybe it is the beginning of a new one. What do you think about that,
    Matt? Do you miss the grunge-era&#39;s style? Or do you think that our new era
    will be too technically oriented?

    <BR> <BR>I definitely don&#39;t miss the grunge style. It lasted for long enough
    for me. I think that type design is headed in a good direction. I don&#39;t have
