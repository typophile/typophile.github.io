  aaah!''. If i wanted to set ''I hammered my thumb'', as the main title and then
  ''and went aaah!'', as a sub-title, how would I do it? Can I set the main title
  as small caps and then the sub-title as italics in parenthesis? Can anyone help,
  or recommend a good reference source?'

    forums are good for questions you don't have the answer to, where blogs are good
    for questions that you do.
