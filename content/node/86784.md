  light weights that will render well on a PC. Anyone? I could sure use the help.

    might be a better way, but this seems to be the best way. (note: it still looks
    ugly on WinXP version of firefox, chrome, ie 7 and under....pretty much everything
    that doesn't anti-alias)"

  body: The one I linked to has pretty decent hinting. It's hard to navigate their
    site, that's all. Monotype probably have some of the best truetype hinters in
    the world. The ultra light had some issues in mid sizes, but the light looks fairly
    nice, judging by the small sample.

  body: I saw it in use on http://telus.com. I don't think they are using externally
    hosted version, so perhaps ask fonts.com a question and reference Telus usage?
