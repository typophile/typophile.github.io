  from the 1910 \u201CDie Br\xFCcke\u201D exhibition at the Galerie Ernst Arnold in
  Dresden. The typeface is said (by this source [[http://www.moma.org/collection_ge/browse_results.php?object_id=138551]])
  to have been designed specially for the project. Does anybody know a little bit
  more about this ?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    that frequently puts the cart before the horse.\r\nConsider that Doesburg\u2019s
    iconic right-angled alphabet (not made into a font until the digital era) was
    not designed until 1919.\r\nThis seems to be an example of what would later be
    termed Purism, or perhaps De Stijl.\r\nCertainly not Expressionist, although it
    works perfectly in this particular publication.\r\nIf anything, its reductive
    angularity might be informed by \uFB01n-de-si\xE8cle Arts and Crafts designers
    such as Rene Mackintosh and Kolo Moser.\r\nHowever, as a type design it stands
    in a class of its own (with a hint of Fraktur in the capitals).\r\nSorry, I don\u2019t
    know anything about it."

  body: "I don\u2019t think that the type was made specifically for this project.
    Years ago, I revived a very similar typeface called Teutonia, from a small foundry
    (Roos & Junge) in Offenbach. Here is the link to the foundry that sells the revival
    \u2013 http://volcano-type.de/fonts/categories/display/mountain\r\n\r\nThis style
    of letter is often associated with Russian constructivism, but it is older than
    that. I am not so sure that Roos & Junge were the originators of the style, either.
    It could be older. Here is the background info that I have \u2026 http://www.typeoff.de/2006/04/08/from-teutonia-to-mountain/\r\n\r\nThe
    type in your image is very, very close to Teutonia (the J is different \u2026).
    But designs in this period often changed over time, or were added to (or were
    copied, well or not, buy other foundries)."

    was four years earlier (in a Dresden lamp factory showroom!), and had annual shows
    at a Dresden art gallery between then and this exhibition, so it's not impossible
    that they had built up enough credibility to merit such an investment."

    important one \u2014 also the first which saw the publication of a catalogue.
    And surely their modest following at the time could not really allow them to impose
    this kind of expenditure on their printer, could it ?"

    group as Die Br\xFCcke could have decided the printer of the catalogue for their
    first important group exhibition to cut and cast a brand new typeface especially
    for them. How the MoMA curator came to that conclusion is beyond me."

    very close to Mountain, it seems to have a fairly rounded beveled edge to it that
    Mountain does not have at all.  There's a word for this slightly rounded off corner
    in type design, but I can't think of it, Nick Shinn mentions it in his Figgins
    Sans specimen.\r\n\r\nmy 2 cents.."

  body: Well, I think, without question that there needs to be a lot more 'terminology'
    in the 'science of type design'.  It's amazing how abstract and seemingly unrelated
    terminology one has to use to explain how Avant Garde is different from Futura,
    say. The scene from Hoefler Fere Jones offices in Helvetica was particularly telling,
    where they talk about how a font needs to be more saturn five rocket or etc....  Everything
    feels connotative, nothing feels declarative.  We do need more exact and more
    standardized words.

  body: That scene isn't "telling" at all. For a documentary aimed at a broad audience,
    of course their descriptions will usefully draw on analogies and connotations.
    More precise technical language exists, it just wasn't appropriate to use it in
    that context.

  body: I think they were attempting to communicate the very best they could when
    they said that.  The whole scene was about the dearth of typographic language,
    and they were explaining how they talk to eachother, not the public at large.
    Also, I'd love to see some of this 'more precise technical language.'
