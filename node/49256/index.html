  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is my first post on Typophile, so i’m not sure whether this is best placed as a Forum Topic or Blog for help, but here goes: I have been asked to create a folded leaflet for NHS Employability. It will be a 6 page DL (flat size A4 - folded twice to DL).</p>
<p>I have created 3 colums with 4mm gutters. Type will be Frutiger - 14pt for headings and 11pt for body copy - there is a 2pt leading for the body copy and all text is aligned to the baseline grid.</p>
<p>I was wondering if these measurements would be suitable for a leaflet like this - as it is the first time I have used InDesign and the first time I have created something for print. If anyone could offer any advice with the measurements or suggest alternative fonts to have the best impact in this medium, I would be extremely grateful.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Thank you for the replies. At the moment, the only &lsquo;visual&rsquo; I have is two pieces of paper with the text typed and pictures stuck to the paper - supplied by the department requesting the leaflet.</p>
<p>My job is to create something more professional from this. As I am new to InDesign (i&rsquo;m a web designer and this is my first print job).</p>
<p>My apologies for dropping this on people here. I have spent all day reading different ideas of what is the best grids, baseline and leading points for print work of this size. All seem to suggest different, so I guess I will just go with one. There seems to be a lack of decent InDesign tutorials on the internet.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are two ways to approach it. If you are just starting out, the look of a virginal empty page could be a little intimidating (heck, it still gives me the shivers) and starting a layout with predetermine grid settings might help you out to overcome that, or it might drive you deeper into a corner and inhibit imagination. Another way, is to sketch the initial layout, get your copy onto the page, then play with it for a little while on a purely aesthetic level, before setting for a particular grid system. Once you get a little more experience, you&rsquo;ll begin relying more on particular combination that you&rsquo;ve found to work well, but in order to get there, it might help to start by working &ldquo;organically&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Just my two cents.</p>

<p>I spent six years in Art School (took a bit longer than I wanted, hah) studying Illustration and Graphic Design (and Fashion, Fine Arts, Painting, Drawing, Lithography, etc), after fiddling around with doing lay–outs for my ‘High School’ magazine for three years. Then I went into pro illustration and visualising, doing design jobs on the side (paste up, anyone remember that?)
Next I discovered the Mac (somewhere in the later part of last century), taught myself QuarkXPress. Did Graphic Design. With Quark for 14 years. Switched to InDesign when OS X became ‘it’. Worked with ID for the last 6 or 7 years and now you want me to tell you how to do the MOST SIMPLE JOB THERE IS?</p>
<p>Learn! Experience! Teach yourself! The Internet is there to help you, giving you the opportunity to look at a lot of stuff. And ID has a very good Help-function.</p>

<p>It may be easiest to use an existing design to give yourself a starting point, and I would imagine they&rsquo;d expect any design produced to reflect their identity guidelines anyway.</p>

<p>Imagine if a car mechanic told you how many cars he had fixed and how he knew the size of every spanner.</p>
<p>Sure Hanabi was asking for something that was not easily answered, at times I have asked similarly demanding questions. For me it stems from the anxiety of being new to something rather than being young — There are 14 year old web/interactive designers who would run rings around many of us.</p>
<p>Is that all fair?</p>
<p>@ AS — I&rsquo;m not sure why pricing was mentioned, I&rsquo;d never advocate selling yourself short, just know when to be charitable :-)</p>
<p>@ Bert/AS/anybody — I&rsquo;m not trying to pick a fight!</p>
