  <BR>i of course alerted the fine folks at organic. <BR>too bad the &#34;designer&#34;
  had no sense of type, otherwise this little infringment of copyright would have
  been flawless. <BR>you gotta have some gnads to rip off well-documented award winning
  work.

    <BR>I think I&#39;m going to license the design as clip-art <BR>for $60 a pop.
    Any takers?

    get influenced by the same things we get influenced by and come up with their
    own solutions too. <BR> <BR>One of the basics of copyright, as opposed to some
    other forms of IP protection, is that it allows for people to independently come
    up with the same solution. It doesn&#39;t mean that anyone copied anyone else
    but that the number of solutions is finite: <BR> <BR>&#34;Great minds think alike
    - small ones seldom differ&#34; <BR> <BR>To be really brutally honest all three
    designs are just standard corporate print look - if you think otherwise you&#39;ve
    been hiding under a rock for the last ten years. <BR> <BR>Some years ago I did
    a magazine redesign, a couple of months later a magazine in the same sector did
    a redesign too - they used the same typeface and similar styling to mine. Did
    they copy me or were both teams so caught up in the spirit of the moment that
    they didn&#39;t recognise the generic response that they&#39;d offered their clients?

    pixel for pixel copy is quite  <BR>another. <BR> <BR>The guy from Oxona admitted
    to copying the  <BR>design. He even had the gall to give me &#34;kudos&#34;  <BR>for
    a cool design. He wanted to make it clear  <BR>that he did not copy the code...
    just the design. <BR> <BR>If the &#39;nuclearcow&#39; site was &#34;inspired by&#34;
    3Com  <BR>it&#39;d be a somewhat different story. This is  <BR>clearly ripped
    off. Do some math: the nav, the  <BR>photo, the headline, the subhead, the body
    copy,  <BR>even the footer and copyright notice are in the  <BR>same position.
    That icon on the right... I  <BR>designed it, pixel for pixel. <BR> <BR>More hilarity:
    their jobs section says they&#39;re  <BR>looking for innovative people. Amazing.
    <BR> <BR>The lesson here is: if you want to protect a  <BR>design you better have
    it copyrighted... and not  <BR>just logos and trademarks. Fighting &#34;trade
    dress&#34;  <BR>infringement is a much harder battle than  <BR>copyright infringement. '

    least a little bit proud of having your work copied. I haven&#39;t had any really
    good copies of my work since a kid named justin copied my skiing penguin in the
    third grade. &#40;but boy did it make me mad&#41;. Realistically, though, a site
    like 3com is an obvious target. There will always be a few people making a lot
    less money in some mom and pop shop copying the big boys. It doesn&#39;t stop
    there, though. Look at the most recent spat between Macromedia and Adobe. I guess
    there is a fine line between cross polination and straight cloning. These guys
    obviously crossed it. '
