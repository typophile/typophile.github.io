  body: Thanks for the list Stephen. There may be one or two scripts I haven&#39;t
    collected there. <BR> <BR>BTW, I see you have added the point size settings for
    the samples/test drive -- very good responsiveness! <BR> <BR>Can you also add
    year of design, please?

  body: Hey Mike. Actually the point size settings have been there since <BR>the relaunch
    in September. Maybe you missed them because <BR>they are only available at the
    Font Detail level. <BR> <BR>Indeed, design year and other notes are on my list
    of improvements.
