		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow. I&rsquo;m really surprised this is so ill received. Before everyone knocks portfolio by email let&rsquo;s consider a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is your final product typically in a digital medium? If so, a pdf should be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more than<!-- raw HTML omitted --> suitable.</li>
<li>You have MORE limitations with a web site than a pdf.</li>
<li>Your work should speak for itself. You shouldn&rsquo;t need to be there, in person, to explain anything.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can give even more concrete reasons to back myself up if the discussion turns to disagreement. Of course, (for example) if you&rsquo;re applying to cut blocks for a printing press, a pdf might not be suitable medium for your portfolio. However, it&rsquo;s 2008, so I can&rsquo;t imagine you&rsquo;re going to get too many interviews without at least a small digital showing first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be interested to hear the reasoning behind the &ldquo;NO!&rsquo;s&rdquo; posted before this.</p>

I&rsquo;d have to disagree, I don&rsquo;t see how the web is more limiting at all really.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I am also in the &lsquo;no&rsquo; camp; unless the job posting or person has specifically asked for an attached PDF. Some companies will block all incoming attachments, and it&rsquo;s possible you PDF won&rsquo;t make it through to begin with. It&rsquo;s also a bit inconsiderate to the person your sending it to, to expect them to download and load your attachment in their mail program when they probably have more important emails to view and respond to throughout the day. I, for one would get annoyed with being spammed with unsolicited emails with attachments at work unless there was a reason, like an actual job posting.</p>
<p>I take exception to the rule in cases like pattyfab&rsquo;s, where she&rsquo;s updating clients.</p>
<p>Links to where they can download a PDF or a link to your website with the option to download a PDF is more polite alternative in my opinion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It really depends on the situation. I don&rsquo;t think there are rules, and most email servers won&rsquo;t block small attachments. When I&rsquo;m soliciting a new client I will send them a link to my web site but may also attach a pdf resume and one page showing some books I&rsquo;ve designed, just to give them an idea. If they don&rsquo;t have the time or inclination to open the pdf - well I can&rsquo;t control that. But to me it&rsquo;s the digital equivalent of mailing a tear sheet. I wonder how many people actually download the pdfs on web sites - I know I rarely do.</div>

<p>Diagree. If it&rsquo;s a digital medium, then a print facsimile as a PDF might suffice, but hardly the best option.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. You have MORE limitations with a web site than a pdf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disagree. Not even sure where to begin with that one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. Your work should speak for itself. You shouldn’t need to be there, in person, to explain anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very true. But the issue has more to do with people annoyingly clogging my in-box than whether or not it&rsquo;s an in-person portfolio review.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against PDFs, of course. In fact, my current portfolio is in PDF format. 
&ldquo;I wonder how many people actually download the pdfs on web sites - I know I rarely do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether you attach the PDF or just link to it directly from your site, it accomplishes the exact same thing&hellip;except the latter won&rsquo;t clog the end-user&rsquo;s in-box.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i think it depends on what you want to achieve. 
What is it for? If you are applying for a job
as print designer, i wouldn&rsquo;t do it. I would
expect something a bit more exciting than
a pdf. (as in format, folding, finishing etc.)</p>
<p>as a webdesigner? yes, as most of your
work is done online anyway, and people
want to see an actual live website you
have done.</p>
<p>Yes it is 2008 and you should be able
to sent a pdf, but as mentioned before
people are getting so many emails these
days that they cant be asked to have a 
look at every email.</p>
<p>I think if you want to stand out and
make a bit of an impact it would be
better to drop off a printed version
of your portfolio.</p>
<p>my 2 cents</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I would have to agree with all of those who said that the best way is to have a link to a site were a pdf can be downloaded. You can even include a small image in your mail as a teaser! It&rsquo;s more polite, than forcing people to download your archives. I know some graphic designers here in Portugal that may look at your web page but won&rsquo;t download your file.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t totally disagree with sending a pdf, but in that case keep it a small sized file, so that you don&rsquo;t cause too much inconvenience.</p>
<p>The printed version was really the best way to go if it wasn&rsquo;t for the printing costs&hellip; perhaps if you can get a interview with the companies&hellip; you could go there and showcase  them your portfolio (this way you only have to print one). If they ask to keep it for a review you can then allays give them you web address!</p>

<p>My problem with a website is, being a graphic designer that does pretty much exclusively print, a website is not my medium of choice. I&rsquo;m not terribly good at website design and tend to not go for jobs that require it so I&rsquo;m not advancing my skills. Also the further and further I get away from college the less I know about it. So something like coroflot, like Darrel mentioned is nice for me.</p>
<p>Eric that seems to be pretty nice too. I&rsquo;m definitely going to look into that further.</p>
