  you all handle multiple [[weight|weights]], such as the [[bold]], if there are any
  routines you go through with it, or anything peculiar to note. If there are a few
  aspects about doing bold and multiple weights, maybe it'd be nice to see a little
  discussion?\r\n\r\nThe only thing I could think of that covered how to make a bold
  was the type design notes at [[http://briem.net|Briem's site]]. Any other resources?\r\n\r\nI
  have made a quick image showing how Minion and Scala do their weights, I might make
  one for sans serifs later. Are there any fonts to note which take a particularly
  interesting stance on multiple weights, or are especially lovely in that respect?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/weights_3868.png]\r\nLook

    somewhere that [[http://www.lucasfonts.com|Luc(as) de Groot who designed TheSis]]
    had some mathematical formula to determine weights and the differences between
    them. In short he said that the optical average between light and bold is *not*
    50%. I can't remember where I read it but I'll keep looking :-)"

    interpolate between very bold and very thin weights, because they are so extreme.
    Would it be better to interpolate between regular and these other weights, or

    problem is, with letters like s, a, and e, the structure and thickness has to
    be changed too much, and so the  intermediate weights suffer. Probably, a little
    above what is 50% interpolated in this test would be about the boldest I can feasibly
    go and have it interpolate well. I could, of course, make another master, and
    go all the way, but I can't go the far with just on bold master.\r\n\r\nI feel

  body: "I am not a type designer, so don't take too serious what I'm going to write.
    But...\r\nProbably, you should rethink your Ultra. As it is very wide, you don't
    need such long serifs, which only accentuate the horizontal axis. They're diagonal,
    so their corners will be visible this way or another. I mean, if you close the
    inner space, serifs could be shortened as well.\r\n\r\nThe a and s have similar
    terminals in the regular weight, but different in the ultra. Refine all ultra
    glyphs first, check them in text; then interpolate.\r\nIt is very easy to find
    wrong ultra letters in printed text, because they will look like heavy black dots,
    or grayish crocks.\r\n\r\nThe best way (in my opinion) to find the bold, is to
    insert single words and longer sentences into a page set with your regular. One
    copy for one intermediate. Then you can show these pages to your friends, and
    probably they won't say \"this\" or \"that\", but something like \"it should be
    between this and that\". Then you decide.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the thoughts Marcin! I think you are correct on all accounts,
    although this was just a rough test. This bold is really just too bold; no one
    in their right mind would use it in text, unless they were already using an ultra
    weight in text and needed a bold emphasis. That said, I think a little bolder
    than the 5% interpolated test would make a good bold for normal use, but like
    you said, testing in a block of text would be my best bet for the bold weight.\r\n\r\nI
    think I'll still have the \"Way Too Bold\" version, but I might close up the counters
    a but more, and definitely shorten those serifs. Even then it might still be too
    bold, and I will probably need to make the stems a little thinner."

  body: I bet people will love and use the "Way Too Bold" in texts. A broad range
    of weights is a plus, not surplus. Such extra can be helpful whenever a designer
    needs to put a special "wayfinding emphasis" into a complex text; it can be used
    as a paragraph intent replacement, etc.

  body: "Thanks for your comments Marcin! You've encouraged me that more weights can
    be very useful! I suppose my reasoning is that, except for a few situations, I
    don't even use bold weights, just semibold. But I think there are certain aspects
    of using different weights that can be a very big plus. I definitely think you
    are right about \"wayfinding emphasis\", I have just never designed anything as
    complex as that.\r\n\r\nFor everyone interested, I've searched Typophile for \"Interpolation\",
    and managed to find these bits in a thread on interpolation and light weights:\r\n\r\nHrant's
    interpolation reccomendations: \r\n<em>\L1) Make a midling weight that looks good
    for text. \r\n\L2) Make a Bold \"candidate\" (maybe using auto-weight-gain + mucho
    tweaking). \r\n\L3) Extrapolate the lightest and darkest extremes. \L\r\n4) Clean
    up the extremes real good. \r\n\L5) Make new intermediates and compare against
    the originals. \L\r\n6) Tweak only the extremes to make any new intermediates
    come out good, dumping the original intermediates. </em>\r\n\r\nHow Tim Ahrens
    interpolates:\r\n<em>1) Prepare an ultralight (maybe even stroke weight 0) monochrome
    weight. \L\r\n2) Extrapolate the extrabold. This will be too \"proportional\",
    i.e. the stroke weight is constant, makeig a and e too bold. \L\r\n3) Modify and
    clean up the extrabold. \L\r\n4) Re-interpolate the regular wight. \L\r\n5) Create
    an MM font with the \"true\" regular and the interpolated regular wight. \L\r\n6)
    Extrapolate a \"triple true\" regular (truer than true!). Now you can see what
    makes the true regular true and make conscious decisions about that. I think the
    most important thing with designing is that you do everything consciously. \L\r\n7)
    clean up the triple true and re-interpolate the true regular. \L\L</em>\r\n\r\n<em>When
    I generate the final instances I put all three weights in one MM font. The semibold
    is not only an interpolation between regular and bold but I add a certain amount
    of extrapolation (regular and light).\r\n\LThe reason for this is that a point
    does not move on a straight line on its way from light to bold (that is why we
    need a true regular). However, it should not move on a line with a kink at the
    regular weight. It should move on a curve instead. So the semibold will not be
    on the direct line between regular and bold. \LI usually prepare an Excel diagram
    that shows the amounts of light, regular and bold in all the instances. Again,
    the graphs schould not have kinks. The semibold usually has about -10% of the
    light weight, 60% regular and 50% extrabold. </em>\r\n\r\nFrom James Montalbano:\r\n<em>To
    make a bold ya gotta move either east or west.</em>\r\n\r\nI think James' comment
    really speaks volumes about bolds in some ways, at least, Frutiger used this method,
    and it worked wonderfully:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/frutiger_6576.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
    seems like an incredibly good and simple solution; the problem is that a bold
    really wants to be a little more condensed than a regular, for two reasons: 1)
    To make a bold really be \"bold\", the space inside should probably be closed
    up more, 2) the bold should be a bit condensed in order to not be a large amount
    wider than the regular.\r\n\r\nBut an improvement in speed and  \"visualization\"
    of the process can be made with this method\r\n\r\n1) Creating an ultra weight
    using this method\r\n2) Creating condensed versions of both the ultra and regular
    by\r\n<ul><li>squishing both versions to say, 80% width</li>\r\n<li>interpolating/extrapolating
    the squished regular and squished ultra to get proper stem widths</li>\r\n<li>tweaking
    if necessary</li></ul>\r\n3) Interpolating with the condensed version to get the
    proper Ultra width\r\n4) Determining the bold weight by interpolating between
    the regular ultra\r\n5) doing necessary tweaking\r\n\r\nI think Superpolator could
    also help this out, I'm planning on purchasing that as soon as possible."
