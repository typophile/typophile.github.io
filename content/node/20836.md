  for type feel but I am having difficulty identifying the font/fonts. The KNOB part
  looks like  \t\r\n\r\nAnzeigen Grotesk: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=413422\r\n\r\nAnd
  the CREEK part looks like a million and 1 fonts. It also feels a little squished.\r\n\r\nThoughts?
  Could this be one font's condensed and extended versions?\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's almost as if they fattened the medium extended version of Akzidenz Grot.
    beyond the bold extd. version. The counter on that "r" is really tight.

    Annonce Grotesque is also similar but still no match for the C and requires a
