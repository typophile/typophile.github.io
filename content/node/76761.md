  I apologize):\r\n\r\nI'm perennially surprised how many users apparently don't test
  their URL in their user profiles after entering it. Many seem to omit the \"http://\"
  prefix, which causes the system to link internally (like http://www.typophile.com/user/www.domain.com/),
  which is annoying and doesn't make any sense.\r\n\r\nWhile this is obviously user
  error, the system could help prevent it. \r\nSince I can't conceive of a single
  instance where this internal linking could be useful: Could this script be changed
  to (1) detect whether the \"http://\" (or similar protocol) prefix has been entered,
  and (2) if it hasn't, auto-add \"http://\" to make a functioning external link? "
