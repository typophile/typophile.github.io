body: So the other day I bought this monolithic pine chest with a 3x3 arrangement
  of hefty drawers for $10, sanded off the [disgustingly thick] varnish and stain
  &#40;man, was that a chore, even with a belt sander&#41;, and now I have a blank
  canvas so to speak. I&#39;ve bought a nice reddish wood stain &#40;and a matte varnish&#41;
  for it, but I&#39;d like to do something more than just restain it all one color.
  But I don&#39;t want to make it a freaky piece that can only be appreciated by a...
  freak. Any ideas? FYI, the dimensions in feet are about 3H x 6W x 2D, and it has
  a nice paneled top &#40;like old wooden floors had&#41;. It was built on June 16,
  1978, which is two days before I turned 10. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hrant, straining pine nicely actually has pretty demanding preparation.  <BR>
    <BR>If you just slap the stain on it will be splotchy and have an unnatural looking
    &#39;zebra&#39; effect as well. Really quite ugly and very disappointing. To get
    a nice result you need to hand sand down with progressively finer sand paper,
    to avoid the splotchiness. Then you need to first put on a pre-treatment - do
    they call it &#39;conditioner&#39; - that soaks in an prevents the stain from
    being too different on the summer and winter wood and getting the zebra effect.
    Then when you stain it will get a lovely natural look with the glow of the deeper
    color. <BR> <BR>Get a book on it for the details. <BR> <BR>This is enough bother
    and the result lovely enough that you may not want to do more.

  body: You can always paint over it, as long as you use the compatible paint - oil
    or water based, as the case may be. I don&#39;t remember about oil vs. water based
    stains. The main thing is that the varnish will have to be compatible with the
    undercoat. The conditioner thing &#40;if I remember the name right&#41; is specifically
    for pine. As it is a soft wood, pine really sponges up the stain, which is why
    it is tricky to stain. The conditioner pre-soaks it somewhat, so you don&#39;t
    get such a stark contrast.  <BR> <BR>If you do decide to go the stain route, try
    the process first on a raw wood pine board, so you will have an idea about the
    result, and whether you like it. Once you stain if you don&#39;t like it you can
    only paint it over or resand. The staining and varnishing is really simple - the
    headache is preparation   <BR> <BR>I took the trouble to look into this stuff
    when I stained some window frames and a door, as I knew I&#39;d have to live with
    it for a long time. Doing it right really did make a huge difference. Now when
    I see pine stained wrong -blotchy, streaked - it screams out at me.

    used to make my own acrylic paint with Rhoplex AC33 acrylic emulsion. You could
    add a small amount of store-bought acrylic paint into a base of AC33 for a translucent
    color. Or you can add raw pigment into AC33. <BR> <BR>This sort of thing can be

    finish. This may be akin to what William refers to as a conditioner.  <BR> <BR>A
    side note: there are 2 additives that improve the brushability of paint. Floetrol
    for water-based &#40;latex&#41; and Penetrol for oil-based. I&#39;ve never used
    them in anything other than house-painting, but they may improve your surface
    somewhat. In house-painting they make a rolled surface looked professionally sprayed,
    and a brushed surfaced look rolled. They may well make a finger-painted surface
    looked brushed, but I&#39;ve never tried.'

    Stain brings out the wood grain,while paint obscures it. <BR> <BR>That said, if
