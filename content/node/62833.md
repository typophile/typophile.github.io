  body: "You're right that it's not exactly the same as Lazybones, but to me it's
    obvious that Lazybones was the basis for this 'design'. Some letters were unchanged,
    but other details were made less exaggerated like having the serifs made smaller
    and the swash elements from Lazybones reduced.\r\n\r\nI suspect you would find
    this among the free font sites.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
