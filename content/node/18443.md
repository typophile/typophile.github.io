body: "Now we've had the whole talk about getting what you pay for and everything,
  but my coworker really likes the Adobe Type font <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0003223>Avenir</a>
  and wants to use if for her personal stationery. We have the font at work, but she
  wants to do it the honest way, just on a tight budget.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest
  a similar font with a not-so-similar price? Any suggestion is appreciated..."

    Of course, if I liberally interpret "not so similar", then you can also choose
    <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html">Gotham</a>, at $397
    for the complete set :)

  body: "She went with Avenir from FontShop, and she's probably going to get just
    the Book and the Medium for now, possibly the heavy later on. She likes Proxima
    Nova but for the extra 8 dollars she's going to go with her first love. She also
    didn't get that Futura joke.\r\n\r\nIt's beginning to sound like this is actually
    for me and I'm using the old \"friend of a friend\" routine, but I'm really not.\r\n---\r\n"
