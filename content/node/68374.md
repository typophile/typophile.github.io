  body: 'Just came across this post in my search for a new typographic poster for
    my walls. After spending hours and days searching for the right one, I finally
    found Danish design agency Playtype. Wow, they have done some amazingly simple
    and minimalistic posters. Just wanted to share with other typo-lovers :-) btw.
    found them here: www.theposterclub.com - ended up buying two and got free shipping.
    So happy :-) '
