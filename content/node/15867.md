  just reviewed a survey in Oct. issue of <em>Graphic Design USA</em> on the <a href=\"http://www.gdusa.com/issue_2005/10_oct/lookout/lookout.php\"
  target=\"new\">Type Purchasing marketplace</a> from the type specifier's viewpoint.\r\n\r\nOf
  note (by the readers surveyed):\r\n\r\nDo you have purchasing influence with regard
  to type and fonts?\r\nYES 88%,\tNO 12%\r\n\r\nHow many designer font users or specifiers
  are there in your department or firm?\r\n1-2  38%, \t3-5  21%\r\n6-10  13%, \t11-15
  \ 11%,\r\n16-25  8%, \t25+  9%\r\n\r\nWhich operating system does your company use
  for those purposes?\r\nmacintosh 88%, window 38%,\tboth 26%\r\n\r\nMany of the comments
  by graphic designers are notable in terms of why and how the make decisions on buying
  fonts, but several comments just sound like \"the smart thing to say.\"\r\n\r\nCOMMENT
  BY GRAPHIC DESIGNER: <em>Before computers changed the designer's toolbox, type houses
  would provide large catalogues that displayed all manner of type style, size, specification
  tables (remember \"specing type\"?) and the like, for a wide variety of font families.
  We kept a huge library of these catalogues that we would \"troll\" for the appropriate
  font. The web has pretty much replaced this huge library, but nothing beats having
  the font resources right at hand. \r\nObviously we cannot purchase every available
  font on the planet so I would suggest to type designers and foundries that they
  send more mailers, promotions and reminders that they have the right \"building
  block\" at the \"right time\" for the design I am putting together.</em> -- Ron
  Kalina, Kalina Design, Exton, PA\r\n\r\nThe survey is followed by several pages
  Type Designers' questions & answers.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I guess it shouldn't surprise me, but it was remarkable how many said "price"
    was a factor in purchasing fonts. The price per font weight doesn't vary <em>that</em>
    much between foundries and resellers. $20-$40. I guess we have some more educating
    to do.

  body: "Hmph. One of the things that influences my buying of a font is the extent
    of a family.\r\nI want small caps; I want <em>italic</em> small caps! If there's
    a bold, a want bold small caps and bold italic small caps! All with matching OS
    figs (in the small caps font, please: why the Roman would contain the os figs
    and the small caps would contain lining figs is completely beyond me, but coming
    from a country with letters and numbers combined for postal codes it is a major
    major pain for typesetting.)\r\n\r\nAm I the last designer on earth who uses such
    things for the sake of consistency? I don't want these things as extra styles,
    I <em>need</em> them so that if I've decided on the use of small caps in my document
    I can use them throughout and not be faced with that hideous conundrum of encountering
    eg. \"USA\" in an italic section or bold heading and having to decide ... now
    do i fake it (bad), break editorial style and set in caps (bad) or change the
    style throughout just to accomodate this incomplete font set (highly undesirable)?\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    if a serif face has a matching sans, I need it all to match: os figs, scaps etc.\r\n\r\nAs
    much as i love and use Eureka & Eureka Sans, the Sans italic has no os figs! What
    kind of BS is that? I have literally had to change to lining figs throughout a
    document because of this.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm too uptight. But the main reason
    that designers give for buying type being \"appropriateness for their message\"
    and, essentially, recognizable, quirky style just makes me roll my eyes, throw
    my hands up in the air and give up on typography forever.\r\n\r\nsorry. got a
    little ranty.\r\n\r\n-marian"

    use smallcaps even if it's right in front of them, even on multi-million-dollar
    projects. In this age sensationalism has trumped discrimination (and this is coming
    from a inveterate rule-breaker, not at all a conservative).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    smart thing to say.\u201D\r\n\r\nIf you know what you are doing, then just do
    it. Many graphic designers \"talk the talk,\" but as we all know few \"walk the
    walk.\"\r\n\r\nWhat I take from the survey is that there is still great potential
    to market typefaces, and almost an obligation to show designers how to use type,
    both traditionaly as well as innovatively. It's like they are all waiting for
    another Herb Lubalin or U&lc to be awed by type again.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nY,

    true, but I don't know if they are willing to buy enough type to pay for it. Gotta
    sell quite a few $40 units to warrant production, printing, and mailing a mag
    of U&lc's quality."

  body: "\xBB <em>Gotta sell quite a few $40 units to warrant production, printing,
    and mailing a mag of U&lc\u2019s quality</em>\r\n\r\nIt's true that printing and
    paper costs are higher now, but if you recall for the first year or two of publication
    U&lc was printed on low grade newsprint with black ink only. The \"quality\" of
    U&lc was in its layouts and content, plus a bullpen of some of the best designers
    of that time. \r\n\r\nAlso, Aaron Burns initially focused on creating a mailing
    base of only type specifiers (built from mailing lists from PLINC, other type
    houses and subscription list from Graphic Design USA) and colleges with art programs.
    The ratio of type buyers to readership was extremely high. Eventually U&lc sold
    ad space as well.\r\n\r\nDeveloping a direct mail piece in <em>magazine-like</em>
    format by a foundry or font distributor would be quite costly today. A better
    approach would be to consider it a true publication, maybe quarterly. The production
    and printing cost, like any other magazine, would be paid in part by the advertisers,
    subscribers (if you are charging a fee) and direct purchase (instead of \"newsstand\"
    sales, it would be single issues ordered via internet, like <a href=\"http://www.artdesign.fr/boutique_us/liste_produits.cfm?type=23&num=0&code_lg=lg_us\"
    target=\"new\">\xE9tapes:international</a>). \r\n\r\nAll in all, it would still
    be major undertaking.\r\nHmmmm... guess we need to come up with another schema.

    Matrix</a> seems to have the makings of a good trypographic periodical.\r\n\r\nThere
    are inherent pitfalls in creating a <em>U&lc</em> clone by a single foundry, large
    or small. For one thing, there is a certain bias to content and a danger of seeming
    too much \"advertorial\" than editorial.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, Agfa launched a large
    format type magazine called <em>26</em> which lasted a short while since by corporate
    standards <em>sales</em> did not offset or justify the cost of publication. The
    attempt was valiant but no one seems to recall the existence of <em>26</em>. \r\n\r\nIf
    a company measures \"success\" of a publication strictly against the sale of fonts
    and within the advertising budget, then it is doomed to fail."
