    Fonts which is no longer published.\r\nIn a previous post you said:\r\n\r\nHefty\u2019
    is the FontBank digitization of \u2019Hellenic Wide\u2019, and is was once in
    a Mac version too (which I have), when it was sold as part of the Expresiv Classic
    Fonts collection by Tiger Direct back in the mid-90\u2019s.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n\r\nCan
    you check and see if this is the font???\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nGary"

    I don't think this font is part of that collection -- at least not the version
    of it that I have. \r\n\r\nDid you send me a sample of this font to ID before

  body: "That does look the same, but that isn't one of the Expresiv font collections
    that I have. The one they called 'Classic' was (I thought) the same as the one
    that Tiger Direct originally sold as 'FontBank'. These are the fonts that are
    still sold at the BuyFonts site. I think Gary's information was basically correct,
    except for which Expresiv package it was in, and that I didn't identify it.\r\n\r\n
