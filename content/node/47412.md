body: This is a poster I made at the Rhode Island School of Design pre-college summer
  program that I'm currently attending, it was made for a basic design class. The
  project was to make a painting inspired by an assigned sin, I was assigned the sin
  of sloth. I very much wanted to make a super graphic, beautiful, and jumpy representation
  of such a brown, slow, and tired sin. I first made it in illustrator then had it
  printed out in black and white, cut that out into a stencil then traced it onto
  a sheet of BFK paper, I then painted it using red gauche. As always, your feedback
  is more than welcome. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture4-1_6051.png]

  body: Looks cool. Composition is solid. Definitely an interesting approach to Sloth
    -- took me a second -- but yeah -- I like it. Hard to tell at this resolution
    -- but the edges seem a little muddy. I could be wrong.
