body: As far as I know type 3 fonts have till now been supported by unix based operating
  systems only. Since Mac OS X is one, does anyone know if type 3 has been implemented
  in Mac OS X <BR> <BR>As you all know type 3 supports shades and graduated fills.
  Basically, it uses the whole language of Postscript

  body: I haven&#39;t tried it myself, but reportedly, OS X does not support Type
    3 fonts at all, at the system level. &#40;At least, some of Adobe&#39;s documentation
    says so.&#41; <BR> <BR>Previous versions of Mac OS supported Type 3 fonts to some
    degree. They were not WYSIWYG because ATM couldn&#39;t render them for the screen
    - so the OS relied on scaled bitmaps from the font suitcase for screen display.
    This also meant that the fonts would only print properly to a PostScript device
    - otherwise you&#39;d just get low-res bitmaps. <BR> <BR>T
