  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am new to this forum and to type design in general. Below my first design for which I would like to get your honest critique!</p>
<p>I started the font under construction via pencil / marker sketches of some of the important small faces, following the general guidelines in the book &lsquo;Designing Type&rsquo; (which I think is an absulote must for every beginner).</p>
<p>I want the font to be applicable as a book type with good readability but &lsquo;with some tension and movement&rsquo; here and there. I started with the &lsquo;a&rsquo; and instead of having a rounded hook, I settled for a &lsquo;curve under tension&rsquo; (i.e. a high curvature at the upper right shoulder. This was then used as the underlying theme in other faces as well (very noticeable in the &lsquo;e&rsquo;, &lsquo;c&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>I would appreciate some feedback so that I can roll in some changes during further development.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!,</p>
<p>Sebastian</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This looks quite readable already in text-sizes, so the overall proportions seem to be right. But actually this can only be assessed if all characters are present, at the moment the more difficult ones are missing yet.</p>
<p>a: too narrow in textsetting I think, wonky lower left part, and it falls to the right. I like the upper part, but maybe it&rsquo;s just a bit too much tension.
d: the bowl is somewhat &ldquo;undefined&rdquo; yet. give it more tension (upper right part of the bowl is too near to the stem, lower part of the bowl is malformed)
h: is it wider than &ldquo;n&rdquo;? It appears to me, but I&rsquo;m not sure.
r: the right flag seems to be slightly too thin. Don&rsquo;t make it bigger, just thicker.</p>
<p>Please take these tips with a grain of salt and please don&rsquo;t rely on them solely, because I am not the Master of Typedesign, but I can only tell what I see, and give some of my experience with my own drafts.</p>
<p>About &ldquo;Designing Type&rdquo;: I own the book as well, and after several months in the bookshelf, I have found how it can be used: I draw my characters without the aid of the book, but when revising them I have a look at the book, and often I find the little &ldquo;problem&rdquo; the character is suffering from.
If I read before drawing, I&rsquo;m so hooked up in &ldquo;rules&rdquo;, &ldquo;proportions&rdquo;, &ldquo;tendencies&rdquo; that every creativity is killed&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Sebastian,</p>
<p>I greatly appeciate you took the time to comment! To learn about font design I went through the string of reviews / posts on your Sofa font (which looks great!).</p>
<p>I spend some time over the weekend and did the remaining lower case letters. During completion of this, I also start making some changes to the original version. I put in a sharp corner instead (as in Bembo) and did the same in the &lsquo;q&rsquo; (not as in Bembo).</p>
<p>One of the things I wonder about as a beginner, is how rigid one needs to stick to the design language, especially for a text font (which seems to me like the &lsquo;high-school&rsquo; of type)</p>
<p>a: I wasn&rsquo;t happy with it also. I put it upright, removed &lsquo;tension&rsquo; and tweaked the bowl.</p>
<p>d: Changed the bowl to be more to the left. The stress is now more to the left. I tried to do that with the b and the q as well.</p>
<p>h: I made it a bit wider than the n. (as outlined in the Desiginging Type book). But I have the feeling that there may be a bit too much white in the counter.</p>
<p>r: Made some changes here to make it thicker. I homed in on the &lsquo;swash&rsquo; a the common theme in this font (a, c, f, j, r and the y).</p>
<p>Also, I moved away from the spurs in the b and q. They didn&rsquo;t seem to belong in this font. Instead I used sharp corners (as the &lsquo;b&rsquo; in Bembo). One of the things I wonder as a beginner is how strict the use of certain design elements is in a text font (which seems to be the most rigorous branch of the art). For instance, in Bembo the &lsquo;b&rsquo; has a sharp corner, but the q has a spur. Would it be &ldquo;ok&rdquo; to have a font in which the &lsquo;b&rsquo; and the &lsquo;q&rsquo; are identical in &lsquo;design language&rsquo;?</p>
<p>I use the Designing Type book more or less the same way lately. When I do a group of letters I look up the general &lsquo;rules&rsquo; and then start drawing and wrangling Beziers. Also, I printed a number of samples of fonts I like and look at how diferent elements are used in those fonts.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks again for your feedback. I hope you can have a quick peek at my updated version.</p>
<p>Sebastian</p>
