  :-&#41;... <BR> <BR>I tried to find the name of that font. It&#39;s look like Decorated

  body: It&#39;s still very small. It looks like Poster Bodoni indeed, but there  <BR>are
    a couple of other candidates, so I can&#39;t tell for sure without  <BR>seeing
    the serif shapes in detail. I pretty sure the 3D effect is  <BR>a customization.
