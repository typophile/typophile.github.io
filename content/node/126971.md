  body: 'There are a lot of typefaces here. It might be more effective to break each
    into a separate ID request as there is a lot going on here.  Evangeline Hill and
    Wyatt Maxwell looks like Letter Gothic. Sofia Rose and Warren Stone look like
    Garamond (stempel Garamond might be a good fit with an alternate apersand). Save
    the Date and Aubrery and Michael  is also Garamond (The italic (I got you ...
    ) looks like URW Garamond but I can''t be sure without a better sample). Details
    also appears to be a Garamond (possibly Monotype). Switzer Fee Farm might be a
    Caslon italic. Theodore and Lawrence is Bodoni. '
