  body: "Wow! That is a great article, Dan - thank you for posting it! \r\n\r\n(I
    just got back from court, where I had to take a client who would not pay me for
    a website I had designed. He said he was not happy with my work, despite the fact
    he has been using the site for 9 months (unchanged), it was generating business
    and I had sign offs on artwork as well as a contract! Needless to say, the judge
    ruled in my favour. Never underestimate the importance of proper detailed pricing
    and a well written contract!)"

  body: Jeff Fisher's book is excellent...only a few bucks and more than well worth
    it. I'm only a student, but I'm reading it a second time through already. Also,
    as I begin freelancing it is helping me create the contract and documents necessary
    to protect myself.

    $20 I have recently spent was on Business and Legal forms for Graphic Designers,
    by Tad Crawford and Eva Bruck. Not only are the forms laid out in the book, along
    with detailed explanations, but all of the forms are available on a handy cd rom,
    in 3 different formats, that you can alter to your heart's content. It's a definite
    must for any freelancer!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Nothing to do with typo or design business, but anybody know what book is
    best for learning Dreamweaver MX? I've really gotta get things going on my site!

  body: You know, I just started using the app without a book and it was pretty intuitive.
    Of course I've used Adobe Go Live before and it was really easy. Why don't you
    try the visual quick start guides? I find they're really great for getting going.

  body: Jason its going to be a problem down the road with Dreamweaver being Adobe
    aquired Macromedia. Either GoLive or Dreamweaver will bite the dust or be changed
    dramaticaly. I wouldn't invest a ton of time learning it (just do something simple
    with your site) until we find where the chips fall. Its just a thought.

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions. I have started tinkering with it to the point
    where I was able to get some necessary information up and I probably will plan
    on keeping things simple. I'm not too big on flashy. Yea, and it wasn't too difficult
    either. \r\n\r\nDan, how do you suppose the Adobe acquisition of Macromedia will
    affect Flash?"

  body: I tend to agree with you Hrant, but don't put it past Adobe to try and squeeze
    every drop out of that GoLive stone. I went to a seminar about the Creative Suite
    2 and the bells and whistles they added are in a practicle world almost useless
    for the amount of money they want for upgrades. Also I get a e-mail today offering
    me a special savings on training seminars. There must be a lot of pressure from
    the stock holders for them to show a huge profit.

  body: Jason they bought Macromedia for Flash and Dreamweaver. My guess is they will
    sell off all the other products. Its the reason Live Motion was dropped (LiveMotion
    was billed as Adobe's Flash killer).
