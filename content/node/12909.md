body: ok this is freaking me out... but i opened up an OT font that i had made and
  changed some things. i then regenerated it and now it won't show up in Adobe apps
  (I tried InD CS and Illy CS). If i highlight a text block and change to the font,
  i get an "Out of Memory" warning. If i select the font and start typing, i can type,
  but nothing displays. the same font works fine in MS word and in textpad. I ran
  it through FontValidator and i didn't get any error messages. and it gets freakier...
  i put the exact same font directly in the Adobe Fonts folder and the font works
  as expected, but i hate having to resort to that workaround. why wont it function
  properly when installed directly to the Windows font folder? has anyone else experienced
  this? anyone have a remedy?

  body: ok, i think i figgered it out... InD was remembering a TT version of the font
    with the same name. I had to delete the 100 AdobeFnt cache files and now it's
    working fine. whew! what do Adobe programs need a font cache for anyway?
