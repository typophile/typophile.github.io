  poster</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jonathanpuckey.com/?p=14\" target=\"_blank\">Some
  of the first sketches I did</a>\r\n\r\nI created this lettering tool in Illustrator
  using <a href=\"http://www.scriptographer.com\">Scriptographer</a>\r\nFirst you
  enter a word in the scriptographer tool options - then the tool gives you the letters
  piece by piece.\r\nClick one and drag -> place the letter\r\nFurther clicks -> adjust
  the letter to the way you want it to be.\r\n\r\nI made an animation using the tool
  by writing the words in illustrator - and recording the screen while I did undo's:
  <a href=\"http://www.jonathanpuckey.com/wp-content/images/typomation.mov\" target=\"_blank\">typomation.mov</a>
  (Quicktime 7 required for viewing) This should give an idea of how the system works.\r\n\r\nThe
  tools is the first in a series of tools that I'm planning to make that gives back
  the direct energy of graphic design. The days that people used to lay out pages
  with their hands. I'm not calling them the good old days, but there is alot that
  we lost after the DTP revolution.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering where to take this. Does
  anyone have any ideas?"
