  an all caps design based off an old sign. Just running it by you guys for any suggestions

  body: "Hi Reid. Great job so far. This looks like a fun project! It is very cool
    that you're basing your design on this pre-existing vintage signage.\r\n\r\nSomething
    doesn't feel right with the S. I wonder if you could try to bring some of the
    top-heaviness consistent with the rest of the alphabet into the S. You might do
    well to depart from the S that is given in the signage."

    top should be somehow closer to the C for example, and remember to keep the waistline
    quite low, like you did on the 5.\r\nI'm also not very sure about the 6, the bottom
    part seems a bit awkward I reckon. I might be wrong, but I think it needs to be
    a bit wider.\r\n"
