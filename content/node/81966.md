body: "I'm kind of nervous posting this here, as I know type design as a career is
  taken very seriously, as it should be, but please hear me out and understand that
  I mean absolutely no offense - as I have a very good friend who is a graphic design
  major and expresses a great deal of love for the craft, which I understand and respect.\r\n\r\nI'm
  an English major in college, incidentally, and am a huge fan of Franz Kafka.  Kind
  of fell in love with him, actually.  Something he wrote in a letter to a loved one
  inspired me.  I've been hankering to get my first tattoo for a while now, and this
  really spoke to me.  I've been searching the net like a crazy person for a good
  font that embodied his handwriting.  I found a free font that did not do it justice,
  but then I found FF Mister K OT, by Julia Sysm\xE4l\xE4inen, which I thought was
  perfect, and she obviously put a great deal of work into it, so, understandably
  it's a bit pricey.  I'd love to buy it eventually, but as of right now my income
  is rather low as I'm a full time student.  I was hoping, that if anyone had bought
  the font, they would be able to type up the phrase for me so I could see how it
  looks?  I would really appreciate it.  I'm not asking for a free download of the
  font or anything like that - I would feel much better if I could just buy it, but
  any money that I do have I'd really like to use for the tattoo instead of buying
  the whole font right now, as a bunch of close friends and I have been planning a
  trip to go get all of ours together.  \r\n\r\nI'd understand if this is completely
  out of the question, but it'd be nice if you could be polite in your rejection of
  my request.\r\n\r\nIn case anyone is curious and wants to see this font and actually
  has the money to purchase: http://ffmisterk.com/\r\n\r\nIt's beautiful."

    font is useful, but I wouldn\u2019t spoil my skin with it, whatever I think about
    Kafka. It\u2019s one of these ideas, that always need explanation. And I don\u2019t
    like ideas, that don\u2019t speak for themselves."
