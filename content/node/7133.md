  body: It&#39;s similar to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-cool-blue/lhf-cool-blue/testdrive.html?s=RIDE&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">LHF CoolBlue</a>. You could achieve a very similar look with a
    few mods.

  body: It&#39;s way too small to properly identify, but try <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=HG23FONT-FO"
    target="_blank"> House Gothic 23</a>.

  body: The logos are different. The one Grant posted in the other thread differs
    from the one on the website &#40;see below&#41;. Like Yves said, it&#39;s difficult
    to tell at such a small size what snowboards is. Another suggestion I can make
    for something similar would be FB&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/armada/regular/testdrive.html?s=S+N+O+W+B+O+A+R+D+S&amp;p=48"
