body: 'Hey guys... I figure that alot of you know about flash and bitmap fonts, so
  what I&#39;m asking probably isn&#39;t a stretch for this forum.  My problem is
  as follows: I&#39;m trying to have a scrollable text box with a unique font I have
  on my computer, but it says I need to have the field set as dynamic text in order
  for it to scroll.  However, it is the use of dynamic text which negates the use
  of a unique font, if you understand what I am saying.  I will post a picture of
  it if you guys can&#39;t understand what I&#39;m saying.  Right now I am using Nokia
  Cellphone from DaFont, and it looks great as a bitmap font, but when my friends
  try to open my page on their computers, it comes up as some type of serif font,
  making it much harder to read as well as frustrating for me.  Any help would be
  so appreciated!!!  I&#39;ve even tried setting the text blocks as graphics, and
  it doesn&#39;t help.  Thanks!!'

  body: We&#39;ve achieved a similar thing on our site where you can type in a line
    and see it in the font you&#39;ve picked, it is scrollable and scaleable. <BR>
    <BR>I think this was achieved with swift generator which produces a swf file from
    the font selected. It might be worth going to the swift site and asking the question
    there. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps. <BR> <BR>Mark  <BR><a href="http://www.fontsurfer.com"

  body: I think I understand the problem, and you need to embed the characters of
    the font you are using. Look to the properties bar when you&#39;ve selected your
    text box, the character button should solve all of your problems. Look up font
    embed in help if you need further instructions.

  body: 'thanks aaron, the embed button did help the fonts to show up on other computers...
    im trying to get my bitmap fonts to show up sharp and pixellated &#40;i.e. not
    anti-aliased&#41;, which happened on my screen with the dynamic text box, but
    not after i embedded the text... any suggestions there? <BR> <BR>here&#39;s what
    im trying to achieve, something that would look exactly like this: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48696.png"
    alt="Sharp"> <BR> <BR>and preferably not like this, if you see the difference
    with the font embed: <BR><!--attachment: ecommexample2-48697.unk*attachment_icon.gif*image/bmp*95.1*Blurry*ecommexample2%2ePNG

  body: Try adjusting the line spacing or leading &#40;I forget what Flash calls it&#41;.
    It&#39;s in one of the Paragraph options and it looks like it&#39;s slightly off
    in your blurry sample.

  body: Also make sure that your text box &#40;and any movie clip that may contain
    it&#41; has the X and Y coordinates set to whole numbers &#40;i.e. 5.0 vs 5.1,
    12.0 vs 12.3
