body: I am trying to find some details on the history of Adobe Minion Pro and Minion
  Web Pro. What I am looking for is information about whether or not the web version
  is a screen version that was prepared along with the print weights, or if it was
  created from the master as part of the large line of Minion weights that shipped
  after Adobe ended sales of multiple master fonts. Along that line, what was the
  original release date, and when and what versions were re-released after the MM
  font sales ended?

  body: "The WebType package was released in late 1997 (I think), so all those fonts
    (including Minion Web) predate both OpenType releases and the end of MM.\r\n\r\nI
    think it's fair to say that the Minion instances for the Web fonts are regrettable.
    They are outside the design space for Minion MM (i.e. extrapolated), which at
    the time I'm sure seemed like a good idea to create something suitable for coarse
    screen resolution, but today just look kinda bad.\r\n\r\nSo, to answer your question,
    Minion Web was created as a separate release, after the creation of Minion MM
    and derived from that source, but before the OpenType-format Minion Pro. The latter
    was derived from the previous MM release, but was edited somewhat and cannot be
    matched to the previous Minion MM release.\r\n\r\nThe OpenType-format WebType
    fonts are essentially the same as the previous TrueType versions, with some OpenType
    improvements like layout features and some additional symbol glyphs. Being \"superhinted\"
    TrueType fonts, we wanted to preserve those instructions, which would have been
    blown away if we messed around with the outlines too much."

    the announcement of OpenType in April 97.

    from Adobe (or anyone else).

    collection?

  body: Well, the WebType package was developed as a whole -- as superhinted TrueType
    versions of certain fonts (or instances of MM fonts) that were already released.
    Minion Web is the only family in the package with such an odd choice of MM instance,
    and of course Minion has a more complicated history (Minion, Minion Cyrillic,
    Minion MM) than the others.

    font embedding would catch on and generate a market for these fonts?

  body: I'm not sure what the motivation was. The WebType release pretty much coincides
    with the start of my employment in the Type group, so I missed the conception.
    (Thomas got there a few months before me, so maybe he remembers more.) But just
    before that I was doing some TrueType hinting for Monotype, and I remember the
    whole super-hinting thing was relatively new and exciting at that time. It's not
    surprising that Adobe was testing the waters.
