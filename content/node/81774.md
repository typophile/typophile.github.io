  enough time to do it right, but they still want it yesterday. I told them, but I'm
  no martyr, so... I'm trying to use FontLab's auto-bold Action (I'm running 5.0.4
  on XP) and apparently it's not as good as old Fontographer's! I can't seem to vary
  the size-gain restriction in each dimension. Even if I do it in two steps (once
  horizontally with dimension gain, then vertically without) it doesn't do it right.
  It's not a clean-up issue (I <em>was</em> planning on doing that) it's a matter
  of trying to avoid vertical squooshing after doing the auto-bold!   :-/\r\n\r\nHelp?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hrant, it seems to work OK on my Mac running 5.04, but a thought might be
    if you still have FontLab 4 installed try it for the Bold Effect.

  body: "If you have the old Fontographer installed, use it for enbolding, generate
    a pfb file from it and try to transfer the glyphs to your FontLab working file.
    There are different ways to transfer the glyphs; for example you could assign
    the font mask of the other font and then swap the outline with the mask.\r\n\r\nEdited:
    Naturally have to adjust the hints (not adjusting, but rehinting with the AFDKO
    autohinting macro), the stem values and the alignment zones.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNot
    a help for the moment, but FontLab is going to integrate the Fontographer enbolding
    algorithm into FontLab Studio, as far as I know."

    is a Bold needs to be wider but not taller, and that \"Keep glyph dimensions\"
    box only does both or neither (and not even very well - in fact it makes things
    <em>narrower</em> - dumb). One would think you could do a bold on each dimension
    separately, the vertical keeping the dimensions and the horizontal not, but for
    some reason it gives the same results!  :-(\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Remember that H weight controls the vertical stem and vice versa for the V
    weight. The number you enter will essentially be double what you ask for. A value
    of 20 will increase the stem with by 20 in each direction. If you use small increments
    you may be OK, but why not just use the interpolate node took on the individual
    glyphs. If the font contains a reasonable number of glyphs, say under 500, I think
    one should be able to do it in a day's worth of work, considering at least a third
    or more of those glyphs will be composites.

    doesn't even seem to be that predictable...\r\nBut I don't really mind the iteration

    if you have Remix Tools you can even go a little overboard with the fake bold
