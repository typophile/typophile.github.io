body: "The band's name is <cite>Big And Loaded</cite> and the concept is pretty self-explanatory:
  The 'Big' is big and the 'Loaded' is loaded.\r\n\r\nThe music they are playing is
  some kind of 'Pop-Punk', close to Bands like <cite>Blink 182</cite> or <cite>New
  Found Glory.</cite>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bal_4891.jpg]<em></em>\r\nSince
  this is for some friends of mine and there is no budget, I decided to make a Slab-Serif
  on my own. It's based on Akzidenz-Grotesk and very much inspired by <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/DE/detail.htm?pid=201429\">Memphis</a>.\r\n<em></em>\r\nI'm
  a little concerned about the 'and' and that it might get lost at smaller sizes.
  The 'loaded' feels a little off right now, but I want to check your opinions on
  this before I move on. I am especially doubting the distance between 'Big And' and
  'Loaded'.\r\n<em></em>\r\nOhh ... and the center of 'I' is the perfect center of
  'BIG' -- reminds me of the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/63567\">Simplease-Logo</a>.\r\n;)"

  body: "What exactly do you mean by the loaded is loaded?\r\n\r\nAnyways, I think
    LOADED needs to be darker...and the face used for that isn't very interesting.
    \ \r\n\r\nThere does seem to be a problem with the space between the lines. It
    looks larger below the B, smaller below the G.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if you remade the
    G entirely so that there was no cut into the bottom of it, and that stroke just
    sort of went directly into the point at the bottom right. But I dunno, maybe that'll
    just look weird..."

  body: I agree with evanbrog. I would start from here and redraw all in a more "vernacular
    lettering" kind of way, in order to tighten the relationship between the different
    elements.

    are truly punk maybe they might even roll with this idea haha..\r\n\r\nOn a side

  body: "Thank you for your feedback. Makes me think about the reason why I decided
    to choose different typefaces. I think this means, back to the drawing board.\r\n\r\n@MrKikkoman:
    This looks like the manifastation of what one of the bandmembers was describing
    to me when I asked him what exactly 'Big And Loaded' means. What an 'enormous'
    approach.\r\n;)\r\n\r\nAs soons as I find the time I will try to adopt your observations
    into the next iteration. Thank you for helping."

  body: Yeah. I don't want to be immature but you have to be aware of your logo and
    its visual message. I see a penis and the name Big and Loaded doesn't help any.
    I'd rethink it.
