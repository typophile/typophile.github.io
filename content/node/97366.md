  the art deco script in the middle of the plate on this book cover. I'm sure it might
  be a custom script by Louise Fili herself, but is it available anywhere (i've found
  other typefaces she has used!)? I am familiar with Adonis Old Style and Coquette
  by Mark Simonson, but they just aren't the right fit for what I need.\r\nthanks
  in advance!"

    or Chic Hand (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/chic-hand/).
