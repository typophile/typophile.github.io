body: Current renderings of the Massachusetts state seal use a sans-serif for this
  motto, but it appears to have been originally drawn as a serif. The face, as drawn,
  is inconsistent in its style, so this might be a tall order to fill. Perhaps someone
  with knowledge of the period (1890-1910) might know what the illustrator was going
  for?

  body: 'The image is atrocious: do you have anything clearer? There''s simply not
    enough distinctive information there. The leg of the uppercase R is usually a
    distinguishing feature, but it is noticeably absent in this example.'

    doesn't seem to be any other published image of the original."

    you surmised, the lettering appears to be hand-drawn and shows \"Old Style\" influences.
    With the exception of the rather clumsy single-serif C in the original, this typeface
    is close\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/bembo-2/16780572/glyphs.html"

    gonna cut it, though. I think an openface Caslon might do the trick.\r\n\r\n"
