    Baroque]]</strong> by Doyald Young (Letraset, 1984)\r\n\r\nThe /l /p /h in your
    sample are different because they are produced by a rip-off font offered by at

    \     Yves ( from NovelFonts!)  \r\n or\r\n      Yen-script (Casticraft/Opti))\r\n
    or\r\n      Yesterday (Softmaker) - I can't verify that Yesterday is a match -
    it just showed up in a list.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
