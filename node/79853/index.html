I own the registered trademark &ldquo;VF Sans&rdquo; but certainly have no right to the word &ldquo;Sans&rdquo; on its own. However if something is too descriptive of what it is, you will not be able to trademark the name. I once attempted to trademark the name 5 X 7 for a typefont made up of dots on a 5 x 7 grid, and that application was rejected.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The only certainty I’ve found within the U.S. legal system is that there are no certainties. This was made abundantly clear to me when I sat on a jury in a civil case. The law is very objective. The interpretation of it is not. That said, you could hire an attorney, but I don’t think that’s necessary at this point in your hypothetical legal pursuit. I have a client who obtained the coveted “circle-R” from the USPTO for a new product. He also successfully pursued a cease and desist from someone who was diluting one of his existing trademarks by using a name that was too similar, a name which at that time didn’t have the official ® protection. He used an online legal service along the lines of legalzoom.com to acquire the official USPTO registration at a cost of around $600 to $700. Hiring your own lawyer to pursue getting the USPTO trademark registration usually cost around twice that or more.</p>
<p>Without going the official route of registration and getting the ®, at some cost, you can declare a trademark by just placing the TM indicia on your product. I’ve gotten into mild dust ups with some brand managers over that because it’s not even legally required any more to use the TM, ©, or ® indicia. They insist though that the lawyers will have an easier time pursuing a case if the outright claim to ownership is staked on the logo or product. You can just stick the TM on anything as a declaration that you claim the trademark. Without the official registration though it’s easily challenged by someone with a registered trademark who believes you’re infringing on theirs.</p>
<p>A case in point similar to your hypothetical example. The air cargo company here uses two generic terms, Federal Express as a registered trademark. I tend to think others in the air cargo company could use other generic combinations of those generic terms and withstand any legal challenge, e.g, Big Express, Blue Express, Federal Air Freight, etc. However, others in different businesses have been hammered by the FedEx lawyers for infringing on that registered trademark. One of the cases that got nationwide attention along those lines was the coffee shop in Syracuse that decided to trademark the name Federal Espresso. They were overwhelmed by FedEx’s lawyers pursing legal action and I think are now called Freedom of Espresso.</p>
<p>Take the above for what it’s worth. I’m no lawyer, but do have to play in the same sandbox with them from time to time. The question in fighting big trademark issues usually doesn’t come down to right or wrong, rather who has the bigger shovel in the sandbox. The question for you (hypothetically) is how big of a shovel do you want to buy to own that name.</p>
<p>It’s also worth pointing out that with trademark law, it only last as long as you legally pursue ownership and work actively to protect against infringement, i.e., they do go stale and expire with neglect. That’s why big brands like Coca-Cola, FedEx, Apple, etc. aggressively go after anything and everything that remotely looks like an infringement.</p>
