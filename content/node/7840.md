body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>This client of mine has a &#34;logo&#34; that has a fontface
  that I cannot find.  His old &#34;graphic designer&#34; will not respond to my request
  for the original files that this logo was constructed with.  He&#39;s being really
  difficult and I really would like to get this done.  Here is the image of the font
  that I need. <BR> <BR>I would appreciate your expertise in this topic and would
  like to thank you now for taking the time to help me out.  Thanks again. <BR> <BR><img

  body: Ruthanne could you do a better job on letter spacing. The YaS is killing me
    and the e looks like a mouth trying to eat the dot in dot com.

  body: Thanks Daniel but that&#39;s not my work <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>...I&#39;m just doing his website, he has already registered
    his craptastick logo so even though I suggested to mock up a new one, it would
    be too much trouble for him to change his logo as it is printed on all his business
    material.  Thanks for the input thouhgh. <BR> <BR>Thanks Franz~!  I appreciate
    your help and taking the time to help me.

  body: You&#39;re welcome! Although it&#39;s getting harder and harder with every
    ITC Kabel ID; I detest this face with a passion.. It does suit the logo though.
