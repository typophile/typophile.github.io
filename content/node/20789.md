  body: "The Cottonelle one reminds me of Forte MT, even though Forte is a good bit
    fatter. I agree about Spring; it's in the ballpark on copying that Downy logo.\r\n\r\nPaul
    D. Hunt wrote:\r\n\"if you need logos, try www.brandsoftheworld.com\"\r\n\r\nMany
    of the brand marks at that site are knock-offs. Some are better drawn than others.
    The site's not bad for just playing around with some logos whether they're authentic
    or not. Even still one can do better by grabbing logos from PDFs on a company's
    website (if the logos haven't been rasterized). Of course, for actual paid work,
    it's always best to obtain authentic artwork (and the useage guidelines) directly
    from the company."
