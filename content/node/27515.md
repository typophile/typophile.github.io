  body: "That's very, very close! Of the Interstate family, I'd say that Interstate
    Regular Compressed is the closest. \r\n\r\nThe type on the street signs actually
    differs from the font in some very small details. It makes me wonder whether the
    sign typeface predates the release of Interstate, and thus represents a slight
    ancestor. Close enough for me. Many thanks."

    should be <a href=\"http://www.clearviewhwy.com/\">ClearviewHwy</a>. "

  body: Actually they are probably still in Highway Gothic which was created in 1949
    for the Federal Highway Administration. Tobias Frere-Jones used Highway Gothic
    as inspiration for Interstate. Albeit his typeface is much more successful and
    legible than Highway Gothic. Highway Gothic is being phased out by Clearview,
    but you could not mistake one for the other because the l in Clearview has a distinct
    curved terminal.
