  comprehensive specimen book (issued in 2004)\r\nand I found something that really
  picked up my spirits:\r\n\r\nA post-modern font that's actually good. It's called
  Duetto,\r\ndesigned by Boris Popov in 2002. It takes a heavy and wide\r\nsans design,
  makes it counter-less, and uses a thin italic\r\nface to form its whites...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Duetto.htm\r\n\r\nThis
  is the only font I ever remember encountering that nicely\r\nconveys two voices
  simultaneously. A PoMo face worth using.\r\nBravo.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
