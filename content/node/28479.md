    base of the T and the 1, and the right leg of the n.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, the
    last time I was cruising BBCWorld's website (earlier this week), I filled out
    their user survey, where one of the questions was soliciting my opinion on their
    logo.  Do you know if the Beeb is doing a wholesale makeover, Tim?\r\n\r\nL."

    of Saturday 7th October. The typeface was designed exclusively for the channel
    in collaboration with Red Bee Media.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a link to some of the

    permanent fixture in the UK since the 1930s, so it's more like suggestive of the
    20th century establishment, which would seem to be an obvious choice for such
    an institution as BBC1 (if not for Saab...)\r\n\r\nI just wondered, since we have
    Phil who was involved in the re-branding, in this thread, what the discussion
    around the positioning of the face was, with regards to the 70s x-height thing."

      Though you see the ident logo for a short period of time its has a strong presence
      and communicates a fresh and solid feeling. After seeing the first time  - I
      knew I liked it and was looking forward to seeing again. I could tell it was
      from Fontsmith as has an attitude resemblance to the 'friendly media' itv typeface.\r\n\r\n'one'
      is GREAT\r\n\r\nI like the optical 'o' shape, I like the reference to Johnston's

    still rolling out, I suspect that some will be more popular than others, for example
    circling hippos and wall of death riders seem better conceived and realised and
    more potential longevity than the football and moon/ships.\r\nTim"

    tourism is quite a big thing among the chattering classes. The effect of ads on
