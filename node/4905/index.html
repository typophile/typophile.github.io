One thing is clear, if we do nothing now, there will be nothing to judge in the future.  Only the most arrogant among us can pretend they know what future generations will cherish.  After all, we can't (thank heaven) even agree among ourselves now on what is wheat and what is chaff.  I am sure Van Gogh didn't have a clue in his life that any one of his paintings would sell for millions of dollars after his death.   <BR>   The only danger is doing nothing.

		<div class="commentbody">I greatly admire innovative work in type design, including Nick's, but I do not think his - your - view  <BR>on this is quite right in the case of type. <BR> <BR>For computers, better ones have made past ones more or less obsolete.  <BR>As a general rule, there is no point in using the last generation of computers. <BR> <BR>With type, I think the analogy is more to architecture than computers. <BR> <BR>I live in the Washington DC area, and two of the best monumental buildings in the area are the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/linc/" target="_blank">Lincoln memorial</a> and <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Dulles_Airport.html" target="_blank">Dulles Airport</a>.  <BR>The Lincoln Memorial is more or less a copy of a Greek temple, with the fabulous statue of Lincoln in the middle.  <BR>Dulles, designed by Eero Saarinan, is an icon of modern design, with its sweeping wing-like roof. <BR> <BR>Was it a mistake to copy an Greek temple in the late 19th century?  <BR>No, because of the resonance with ancient ideals of democracy, and what Lincoln stood for in extending these ideals to all Americans.  <BR>Also by simply doing a copy, they didn't mess it up, but got a fabulous result. <BR> <BR>Saarinen's design was very much of its time, but when it came to expanding it a few years ago, they just doubled the length, not changing anything.  <BR>In fact this was the original design, and Saarinen had adjusted the design so that only half could be built first.  <BR> <BR>Was it stupid to simply build a 60's design in 2000? I don't think so.  <BR>It works beautifully. <BR> <BR>Now it would have been stupid in the '60s to build an airport as a Greek temple.  <BR>Having a modern building was appropriate and worked well. <BR> But expanding it in the 60s style - the only smart thing to do. <BR> <BR>I think these examples illustrate that what is appropriate in design and use in relation to history is a complicated matter,  <BR>and that newer is not necessarily better.  <BR>There is a place for historical revivals, and they are sometimes better than the contemporary  <BR>- and sometimes not.  <BR> <BR>I may be wrong but I detect in Nick's arguments some buying into Hegel's idea of the 'zeitgeist', the spirit of the times.  <BR>Of course, fashions are a reality, but what Hegel is claiming is that some are superior, the 'wave of the future',  <BR>and that everything that doesn't go along with the Zeitgeist is backward.  <BR>The same type of thinking goes is in the somewhat different idea that there is an 'avant garde',  <BR>and everything else done is more or less stale and worthless.  <BR> <BR>Fashion is exciting in itself, and I have nothing against it.  <BR>But most fashions go stale and a few turn out to be lasting.  <BR>Because something is innovative doesn't mean it is necessarily good or most appropriate for every project and setting.  <BR>In many cases old and good is better even than new and good.  <BR>And of course the other way around is also often true. <BR> <BR>A new design that is good is a greater personal achievement for the designer,  <BR>but it is not necessarily better than an old design, even for contemporary works.  <BR> <BR>I think new, excellent work that that done by some who post on this board, including Nick, is exciting and wonderful to have and use.  <BR>But that doesn't mean that less innovative work is less useful or appropriate in many, if not most, contexts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, my perspective is more Marx than Hegel. <BR> <BR>The appearance and function of fonts are important &ndash; they have to do the job &ndash; but appearance and function are not absolutes, but culturally specific. <BR> <BR>I think it is important to express the zeitgeist, but not for reasons to do with historical time. Like Tiffany, I am neither for or against tradition or fashion. What concerns me is that people today should contribute to their culture in a meaningful way (hopefully paid as well).  <BR> <BR>What I object to is that in many ways Helvetica, and the &quot;Adobe Original&quot; are our zeitgeist. The Adobe Original is, with perfect Newspeak, a revival. Now matter how &quot;good&quot; such a typeface is, it represents the way that trans national corporations have come to dominate the cultural landscape, restricting opportunity for content creators. <BR> <BR>Helvetica, Adobe Garamond, and Minion are good typefaces, but they would not occupy their present position of popularity had their free distribution not been part of a strategy used by companies whose primary business is to sell other, more lucrative products such as computers, operating systems, and major applications. <BR> <BR>On the upside, there is a thriving, diverse industry in script fonts (with a growing prosumer market), and, to a lesser extent, pixel fonts (for Flash). <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. You know very well that I wasn't being profound. And yet you had to go for the easy smart remark. Oh well. I was simply trying to point out that I was thankful for the variety, new and old. It would be financially impossible to license all of the type to which I really would like to have access. I would hope that type designers today would want to improve or at least work toward an ideal improvement of their own thinking. Why design type if you aren't trying to improve?

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, <BR>I went to a bar the other night to attend <b>A tribute to the Smiths</b>. <i>Why!</i> you might ask, when I can stay sad and misunderstood on this forum?  <BR> <BR>&gt;<i>What I object to is that in many ways Helvetica, and the &quot;Adobe Original&quot; are our zeitgeist. The Adobe Original is, with perfect Newspeak, a revival. Now matter how &quot;good&quot; such a typeface is, it represents the way that trans national corporations have come to dominate the cultural landscape, restricting opportunity for content creators.  <BR>  <BR>Helvetica, Adobe Garamond, and Minion are good typefaces, but they would not occupy their present position of popularity had their free distribution not been part of a strategy used by companies whose primary business is to sell other, more lucrative products such as computers, operating systems, and major applications.</i> <BR> <BR>I've noticed that there are posters that seem to (re)formulate some of my thoughts better than myself, but concerning what you wrote: <i>I have never suggested anything like that.</i> In fact, I agree with you.  <BR>But that wasn't what I was aiming at to begin with either. <BR>Just because I have a different approach when it comes to type doesn't make me all those things you dislike. Or?  <BR> <BR>My point was (I think): Don't try so hard to be clever. For me <i>that's</i> the easy way out. That's like chosing a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/zapfino/linotypezapfino-one/testdrive.html?s=Oh%2Bdear%2BI%27m%2Ba%2Bsensualist&amp;p=60" target="_blank">script</a> when designing a <a href="http://www.ionikh.gr/ico/chanel5Edp.jpg" target="_blank"> perfume logo</a> because it could be considered <i>sensual</i>. <BR><i>Nota Bene</i>: Just because I don't want to encourage that kind of design doesn't mean i want to ban it. <BR> <BR>Please forgive me Tiffany, that remark wasn't my greatest contribution on this forum, but neither was your truism. <BR>I agree with you too. Today, I'm mr. agreeable. <BR> <BR>Yours, <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">These issues go all over the map. Obviously there is need for &quot;good book faces&quot;, old, or new. We have an abundance of the rest. <BR> <BR>Still the real question remains. What makes for good book design? Is it as Nick suggests, type decision, and type decision only. Otherwise he asks, &quot;why not use default grids?&quot; <BR> <BR>(not exact wording, to lazy to find the archives) <BR> <BR>Clearly questionable logic. One (1) good book face is more important than quantity. The work of Aldus Manutius demonstrates not only one (1) good book face, and take further note, in one (1) point size only. Aldus Manutius is a name you should all know. <BR> <BR>A good book designer can certainly produce beautiful books with &quot;a single type face for their entire working career.&quot; <BR> <BR>I say to &quot;those that disbelieve&quot; that they know nothing of the history of book design. In fact, contrary to arguments type designers offer, just examine the plethora of typographical book design failures in spite of &quot;accidental good type face decisions&quot;. <BR> <BR>Type face choice is an important ingredient in book design, as is paper, paper size, colours, margins, illustrations, text page to sheet size ratios, point size, spacing, line length, table of contents, character count, binding etc. etc. <BR> <BR>Easily comparable to cooking. Without quality ingredients it is impossible to make the finest of foods. However, that said, &quot;a bad chef&quot; can not make a culinary masterpiece from the finest of ingredients.  <BR> <BR>The &quot;cook for the book&quot; is the designer, not the ink saleman, type salesman or the &quot;green grocer&quot;.  <BR> <BR>Remember what your mothers said, &quot;too many cooks spoil the broth&quot;. <BR> <BR>Type design is not the Eiffle Tower of typography. What is so badly needed in the type manufacturing industry is a broader appreciation and understanding of the industry at large. Navel gazing should be kept to a minimum. <BR> <BR>The &quot;type designers and manufacturers of 90,000 digital fonts doe not dictate taste&quot;.  <BR> <BR>&quot;Good taste&quot; is a sophistication of refinements. Like it or not. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">IMO, it's not the typeface, it's the designer who causes mischief. For every well designed book that makes the AIGA, there are scores of difficult to read solutions being OK'd by editors and publishers who should know better. If I may do so without sounding contentious, I would take exception to the comment above concerning typefaces in use in CH and D in the 50s and 60s. I was there, and I assure you that the Swiss, all over their well-ordered country, set plenty of Times New Roman better than we were doing in the USA. Ditto for Baskerville, Bodoni, Clarendon, and the lovely Diethelm, which we did not have. The output of even the smallest regional newspaper and job shop was far superior to our larger shops. Furthermore, they did it all with a dozen or so faces compared to our hundreds, most of which were just as mindless in metal as the digital of today. FWIW</div>
