  in [[http://www.typophile.com/node/55405|this thread]] from a different sample I
  provided. Now I'm stuck on the 'Company' portion of the logo (unfortunately, partially
  because the sample is so small).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img_5606.headlogo.png]\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone is able to provide a bit more insight, it would, as always, be greatly appreciated!"
