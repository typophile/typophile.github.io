body: "Here's my first attempt at a complete font in a long time. It's a modern-looking
  slightly condensed slab serif. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a look
  and suggesting areas for improvement. I know the uppercase S needs work, and there
  are a few other things that seem like they might be odd, but I've looked at it so
  much that I need some outside input.\r\n\r\n(It's not going to be called Slabbo,
  thankfully -- that's all I could come up with for now)\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

  body: I really like tis design.  Two suggestions-if it was me I'd angle the crossbar
    of the e to follow the slope that runs through other things-like the bottom of
    the loops on p and q for instance.  I'd also lenthen the downsloping diagonal
    in the ampersand to reach the baseline.

  body: "I guess, Paul get that bounty.\r\n\r\nHm, when I originally looked at it,
    only the \"&\" stroke my eye, here I have to second him. Now, however, having
    read his post, I have to agree on the \"e\". try to parallel the design element
    of slope of the \"a\", \"p\", \"g\", etc.\r\nWhat about some tweak to the descender
    or \"g\" into the same direction as well?\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"

  body: "No donation needed:\r\n\r\nGenerally: \r\n\r\nThe first thing I would say
    is: Think about the white spaces just as much as the black. This means in common
    combinations in between the letters and in terms of the white spaces made by the
    insides of the b vs d vs h vs s and so on. to my eye they are not harmonized.
    This will take time to be able to see and think about. But it's good to start
    early.\r\n\r\nThis font is very \"constructed\", meaning it appears to be made
    of common parts. There is nothing wrong with this per se but it can lead you to
    simply put the font together with the parts you have rather than inventing new
    ones when you need them. Also superficially similar parts often need to be tweaked
    to work well and so are not really the same. \r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\nYour
    a looks too much likean o - it won't identify as a quickly enough. The inside
    bowl of your b is too small. It doesn't fit with the other letters. The p,g &
    q are awkward in their joins. Look at your u. It is working better. Your arm of
    your r is too tentative. Maybe extend the serif of the botto right of the r a
    bit. The t is weak - let it expand.The top of your o needs to overshoot further.
    The crossbar on the f is too small so the f doesn't reaf as an f quickly enough.
    The x and w are too heavy. Lighten those strokes so they fit with the other letters.
    The descenders on the p & q are not the same. Why? The design of the s isn't working
    with the feeling of the rest of the design. Cutting the ends of some letters of
    at an abngle doesn't seem to fit either. Maybe go flat or pick a different angle.\r\n\r\n
    Keep in mind that each letter needs to be a memeber of the family and not stand
    out too much.\r\n\r\nThis is a lot I know. This fellow may be able to help:\r\n\r\nMaybe
    check this site out: http://briem.ismennt.is/index.htm\r\n\r\nGood luck with this,
    and keep going!\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Thanks so much for all the help! This is exactly what I needed.\r\n\r\nEben,
    you're right -- it does look like it's constructed of common parts. I suppose
    that's because it is. That's definitely an area I need to work on, and will hopefully
    get better with practice.\r\n\r\nI'll work on a revision and then post my progress.\r\n\r\nPaul,
    where would you like me to send that shiny quarter?"

  body: "Hi Jonathan\r\n\r\nThis face has got some very nice modern forms the Lowercase
    d and p in particular. I would reign in the both of the Ss, they have two much
    character. The f would benefit from a higher wider crossbar and the t's crossbar
    should also be wider. I also agree with whoever said that the r is timid looking.\r\nHave
    a look at a face called Flama its a nicely drawn sans but with a hint of DIN in
    the square shapes. \r\n\r\nAnd bear in mind that this is all coming from a someone
    who's been designing type for at least 20 years but has yet to finish one. I therefore
    have a lot of respect for the people \u2013 including yourself \u2013 who post
    their designs here. \r\n"
