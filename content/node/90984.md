body: "I am looking for a serif for a women's literature/art/environmental 'zine and
  have narrowed it down to Mrs Eaves for the body copy.. I'm hesitant (... it seems
  overused, but really didn't want to go to Garamond or Arno), but for the look, feel
  and overall projection of the 'zine, Eaves seems to fit well and look spoken from
  the perspective I am after (.. a tad more feminine). Also looking for a sans serif
  to pair, but am coming up blank.\r\n\r\nThis 'zine is modern, but also praising
  elements of women's history, so want to pair a more formal/historic serif type with
  a gentle/clean sans.. It's 72 pages, and don't want to overdo it with number of
  faces I am including.\r\n\r\nAny experienced editorialists out there that could
  help weigh in? Help much appreciated.\r\n\r\n-A"

  body: "I think Mrs. Eames is both overused and not a great choice for body copy,
    which Emigre openly admits. You could look at Mrs. Eames XL, the new-ish version
    with a larger x-height and more condensed proportions.\r\n\r\nhttp://emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=212\r\n\r\nBut,
    honestly, there are a lots of \"formal/historic\" serifs with touches that might
    be considered feminine. Just a quick glance at Typographica's Best of 2011 will
    yield several options:\r\n\r\nhttp://typographica.org/features/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2011/"

  body: "> someone dislikes Ms. Eaves built-in spacing.\r\n\r\nLike Robin Kinross.
    Or the guys who paid Terminal Design\r\nto fix it. It's not just me! :-)  I'm
    probably the most vocal though.\r\nPartly because it's also over-used, and it's
    just unnerving to me\r\nseeing a font with defective spacing being blindly used
    for text,\r\nwhich thankfully happens a lot less these days.\r\n\r\n> Emigre openly
    admits\r\n\r\nThat's gracious. (Even though it did take a while...)\r\n\r\nLeksa
    looks quite nice.\r\nIt's very big on the body though, so would have to be used
    small.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I had no idea that Mrs. Eaves had already become overused. I would have tended
    to recommend one of the much <em>more</em> overused plain garden-variety Baskervilles
    - such as Monotype Baskerville instead as an option for body copy. Not Fry's Baskerville.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback and advice here.\r\n\r\nBeen experimenting for a
    couple days now on body copy, headers, etc.. The zine size is smaller than I would
    like, with lengthy provided text.. needs to be readable.\r\n\r\nThe client requested
    \".. a combo of Georgia and Raleway..\" .. Georgia just isn't sitting with me.
    \r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: "It sounds like your client is gravitating towards free fonts...\r\nIf that's
    the case let us know, since that greatly limits choice.\r\nLeksa though is looking
    stronger now, since you have the issue\r\nof saving space (and the bigger the
    x-height the better for that).\r\n\r\nBTW, Raleway looks like it needs some spacing
    help of its own...\r\nAs for Georgia, if you could nail down exactly what's bothering\r\nyou

    I do suppose the more free, the better ha wish I had a budget for this, just trying
    to make it beautiful with little resources and tight-ish deadline.. \r\n\r\nGeorgia
    just reminds me a college brochure body text (previous project had me use it every
    way, shape and/or form) so I'm prob just biased.. It's a classic, but kind of
    wanted an update from that.\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The client requested \".. a combo of Georgia and Raleway..\" .. \r\n\r\nGeorgia,
    a great typeface, was designed optimally for screen reading. How will your zine
    be printed? Offset? Digital? That should influence your typeface's choice. As
    a personal advice, I would rahther use a bundled - and probably \"overused\" font
    -, instead of a free one, if you don't have to spend anything on fonts. And if
    you don't want to go with Garamond or Arno, then there is Adobe Caslon, which
    has been designed by a woman and has some classy \"feminine\" feel. But, generally
    speaking, I wouldn't avoid using a well-designed typeface just because it is overused."
