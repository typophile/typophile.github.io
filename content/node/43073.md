  body: "I downloaded Metalista and noticed something strange in the hhea table: the
    ascent (1536) and descent (-348)  values look suspicious, the effect is a huge
    line height respectively very small cap height in some applications (e.g. TextEdit
    on Mac OS X).\r\n\r\nJens"

    a freebie, so I\u2019m not really entitled to make any demands \u2013 but as you
    laudably have included all those diacritics, do you think it\u2019s possible to
    do an \u2018\xDF\u2019, too? And in case you find that unsuitable for a unicase
    face, is there a technical way to automatically substitute \u2018\xDF\u2019 by
    \u2018ss\u2019? I just stumbled across this minor flaw: By assigning Metalista
    to a little text in InDesign, all the \u2018\xDF\u2019 instances just disappeared.
    No warning, no empty box, nothing.\r\n\r\nF"

  body: "Thanks, Tomas! You've fixed it :)\r\n\r\nFlorian, I think the easiest solution
    would be to put two S into the \xDF glyph slot. But this post wasn't posted in
    the critique section, so we're content with what we get ;)\r\n\r\nEdit: Using
    the \"All Caps\" feature in InDesign automatically turns the \xDF to SS, so that
    could serve as workaround.\r\n\r\nJens"

    a good workaround indeed. Thanks!"
