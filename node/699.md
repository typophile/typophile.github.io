body: holy cow! what an awesome time i had in minneapolis. now i&#39;m all excited
  because i actually know fellow type-heads on this site. probably the best part for
  me was just meeting people in the community and making personal connections. i always
  love making new friends, and am already excited about the prospect of returning
  next year, to hang out and meet even more of you fine folks. as far as the actual
  program goes, my favorite stuff was the lettering workshop with ken barber, the
  letterpress tomfoolery on friday afternoon &#40;what&#39;s this colored stuff on
  my hands?&#41;, and the typeface; twin cities presentation. well, who can forget
  armin&#39;s repeated mention of &#34;the f-word&#34; during the blog panel discussion?
  funny stuff.  <BR> <BR>so, what was your favorite part everyone?

    about making connections again. <BR> <BR>We had some phenomenal volunteers! All
    those art students blew away every one of my classist stereotypes by being both
    responsible, friendly and reliable. Many thanks to them for making things go so
    smoothly! <BR> <BR>More later.... <BR> <BR>

  body: I heartily underscore Kristin&#39;s mention of and gratitude for the student
    assistance &#40;largely from MCAD&#41;. It was a privilege to meet the students,
    to work with them, and to see them participate in many aspects of the meeting.  <BR>
    <BR>We&#39;re all beginners at some point in this field; students are our past,
    present, and future. They were crucial to the success of this year&#39;s TypeCon;
    those of us who are professionals must reciprocate by assisting them however we
    can. In doing so, we will all have a richer future. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: 'I&#39;m here, I&#39;m here. I&#39;ve been putting a review of TypeCon together,
    and I have so much stuff to say. It&#39;s going to take more time than I thought.
    I&#39;ll let you all know when I&#39;m done. <BR> <BR>And well, I guess I have
    to step up to the plate and put my dream in writing and in Google&#39;s cache
    for generations to come. So here it is, uncensored, unbiased and with Hrant&#39;s
    blessing: <BR> <BR>I dreamt that Hrant came to my house, the weird thing is that
    it was his typophile picture only &#40;since that is as far as I know what Hrant
    looks like&#41;. So he came in, and went &#34;Number Two&#34; in my bathroom without
    flushing, after that, he headed out to the kitchen to hang out and stuff. So I
    go into my bathroom and see these unflushed turds in my toilet. I go up to Hrant
    and say &#34;Excuse me, Hrant, you left your turds in my toilet.&#34; His response
    involved handing me a plunger and adding &#34;This should fix it.&#34; And that
    was it.  <BR> <BR>Freud would have a field day with this one.  <BR> <BR>TypeCon
    rocked! <BR> <BR>Oh, regarding the &#34;f&#34; word stuff, did anybody notice
    that I actually never said &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; during the talk?'

    be like. But the actual experience went far beyond my expectations. It was so
    great to meet and talk to so many interesting and talented people. The workshops
    and talks were great too. Tamye, Richard, and everyone involved did an amazing
    job and I feel privileged and lucky to have been a part of it. I can&#39;t wait
    for the next one.

    <BR>Hermann Zapf thought of himself as, foremost, a book designer. <BR> <BR>Chank
    enjoys mowing. <BR> <BR>The answer to the following trivial question: &#34;If
    you were a collector of Matthew Carter&#39;s typeface designs, which type technology
    would you &#40;currently&#41; be missing?&#34; <BR> <BR>To improve his faces,
    WA Dwiggins wanted to get &#34;closer to the machine.&#34; <BR> <BR>The twin cities
    &#40;and typefaces thereof&#41;: more interesting than non-mid-westerner might
    assume. <BR> <BR>If you want your signage to be readable, you test it. <BR> <BR>Letterpress
    is addictive. <BR> <BR>The road to typography goes through one&#39;s self. <BR>
    <BR>&#34;I&#39;m using type as image&#34; is not an excuse for typographic ignorance.
    <BR> <BR>TypeCon 2004 will be in the bay area.'

    for honesty, clarity, and spontaneity in online discussion, he was sadly misunderstood!

  body: Friends and fellow Typophiles. My heart and mind are the both of them full.  <BR>
    <BR>TypeCon was amazing. The event itself was well-planned and well-executed!!
    But it was the people that &#34;made the pudding&#34;. Being able to talk with
    others whom are as obsessed and in love with letters as much as am I, well, it
    left me content and happy and overwhelmed. All at the same time.  <BR> <BR>The
    conference high points for me were Letterror&#39;s presentation of their Metro
    &#40;for reason&#39;s both obvious to those whom also attended, and a few reasons
    better left unwritten&#41; and Peter Bilak&#39;s &#34;Tschaikovsky Ballet&#34;.
    It was Tschaikovsky, wasn&#39;t it? &#60;<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#62; <BR> <BR>Jon, your summation is perfect. P-E-R-F-E-C-T!!  <BR>
    <BR>Meeting all of you, putting names to faces &#40;and with this mind hopefully
    they&#39;ll stick&#41; ... The internet is wonderful, but you certainly cannot
    replace the human warmth that comes from sharing your personal space with someone
    that understands your passions in life. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m completely exhausted,
    but in a did too much, didn&#39;t sleep enough, didn&#39;t want to sleep, kind
    of way. <BR> <BR>For those that didn&#39;t go this year, create a little piggy-bank
    and start saving NOW!! <BR> <BR>Be proud of the little neighborhood that you&#39;ve
    created here at Typophile. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to bed now, 5 hours earlier
    than the last few nights. Possibly I&#39;ll have more thoughts to add tomorrow.
    For now I go to bed with a smile of satisfaction on my face.  <BR> <BR>Oh, and
    one more thing. Kristin, you rock!  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Hello everyone! I got back to Vancouver this afternoon and after 5 hours of
    much needed sleep, it&#39;s great to see you guys here talking about the conference
    already! Armin, your report is excellent! Yes, the conference was just amazing.
    It was way beyond my expectations! I enjoyed it so much. It was a little weird
    at first to meet some of you in person after having known each other online, nothing
    can substitute a real meeting! I think we have to thank our online community for
    uniting us beforehand, which is partially why this event was so successful. I
    now know I have real friends all over the country/world that share a common passion!
    Of course we have to thank Tamye and SOTA, for their tireless work putting together
    such a well-organized and content-rich conference! Well done! I&#39;ll be back...
    I&#39;m so tired I can&#39;t really think straight right now. I&#39;ll get myself
    organized and write up something on my site soon.

    <BR> <BR>Tyler - was a pleasure to meet you. You are a good man,  <BR>and funny.
    <BR> <BR>Kristin is the coolest. She is both the mom you wish you  <BR>had and
    the distant friend you wish was living nearby,  <BR>dispensing wisdom and humor
    with humilty <BR>and ease. <BR> <BR>Praise to Mr. Coltz for gracing Typophile
    with his presence. <BR>His posts from today are all indicative of the quality
    we can <BR>expect from Jon. His writing is better than his dancing <BR>&#40;fortunately,
    we all have a much greater need for the former&#41;. <BR> <BR>Dyana, I envy your
    job and latin moves. Glad to finally meet <BR>you, and I look forward to your
    FB releases. <BR> <BR>Mark Simonson probably didn&#39;t detect it, but I was in
    such <BR>giddy awe of his presence at my table during lunch on <BR>Saturday that
    I couldn&#39;t eat my quesadilla. What a friendly, <BR>amiable fellow, full of
    talent, and willing to share. Mark <BR>personifies the best aspects of TypeCon.
    <BR> <BR>Keith - Please monogram my linen. Your lettering skills are striking.
    <BR> <BR>Jared &amp; Joe - I expect you to post the video coverage of our  <BR>panel
    discussion soon. It will prove that you two are the <BR>driving force behind today&#39;s
    typographic dialogue and  <BR>community. Without dominating the panel, you directed
    the <BR>discussion down the most prudent path. I was proud to  <BR>share the TypeCon
    experience with a couple of Utahns. <BR> <BR>John B, Chris, and the others. It
    really was grand to meet <BR>your faces. I wish I had more time to spend with
    you. Next <BR>year, for sure. <BR> <BR>Tiffany Wardle is the best roommate ever.
    I suggest you all <BR>consider bunking with her at AtypI.
