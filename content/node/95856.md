  about a substitute. The for is from the Emigre typehouse http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=91\r\n\r\nThe
  italic lowercase version is troubling a client and we're looking to find an italic
  face that would be compatible with Eidetic's roman face. Normally we would hand
  adjust the roman as a hack, but the font's lower case \"s\" is too distinctive (and
  it would be a tone of work).\r\n\r\nAny guesses or recommendations?"

    the Type ID Board to the Design Board.\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with the Eidetic italic?
    Too swashy? Too dark? Too wide? Is this for text? Maybe re-phrasing the question...
    What font looks like Eidetic that you can look at for an italic?\r\n\r\nCourtesy

    went sort of auto-pilot with my post.\r\nAnyway, regarding Eidetic, the OT version
    of it has an alternate (plain) |s|: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/eidetic-neo-ot/italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/510638/245"
