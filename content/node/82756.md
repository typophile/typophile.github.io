body: "Hello, I have developed a website that uses a particular font. All was good
  until the client told me that they want the website to be multilingual.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe
  problem is that the font I have selected does not support some of the characters
  present in the other language (ex: \u0127). I have little experience on how to solve
  this problem since this will be my first multilingual website. Therefore my question
  is; how can I search for a font that supports these special characters? Do I really
  have to go through all the fonts and try them out? Or maybe there are some well
  know fonts that support such special characters?"

    if the EULA permits, and if you know what characters are needed.

    see what the page will look like: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/engndlnldodigdjamndkplafgmkkencc\r\nSorts
    Mill Goudy should work, for instance; probably Crimson Text, as well. Most don\u2019t
    have the Esperanto characters I need, though they might have Polish and so forth."

    apparently. If you list the characters you need and the style of font you are
    looking for, you may get some more helpful responses."

    for a quick stop, try looking at the [[http://www.dejavu-fonts.org/|DejaVu fonts]]
    and the [[http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont/|FreeFonts]]. Both have good
    coverage."
