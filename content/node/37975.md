  readable to create a book? Thanks"

    a book!\r\n\r\nNow to your question: don't change the character spacing for Times
    or any other typeface is MS Word... the font already has built in kerning... Does
    this make sense?"

    would be an opinion, not a rule. Times is a tired font, not a wrong font.\r\n\r\nDon't
    use Algerian to typeset a book would be a rule."

  body: "><em>\"(Format > Font > Character Spacing)\"</em> \r\nIt seems you are confusing
    terms. Kerning is different than letter spacing. \r\n\r\nFor any substancial amount
    of text in TNR at 10 pt, I'd set the letter spacing at something like .4 or .6
    pts.\r\n\r\nAnd, what they said.\r\n\r\nR"

    your e-mail about the above comment. What I mean is: don't use a word processor
    program if you can use a page layout program instead. If you want to stick to
    Microsoft software, Publisher would be better-suited than Word for the task of
    setting a book."
