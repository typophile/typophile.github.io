  do you know who use one or at least few typefaces?\r\n\r\nTry to think apart, or
  outside, from helvetica and the international style.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n"

    designers try to find versatile, high-quality typefaces. I find a lot of times
    when I'm off searching for some feeling the familiarity of Din, Gotham, Avenir
    lends well to a lot of projects. Just some thoughts. You might like 8Faces. It's
    a typography based magazine that asks designers if they could only choose 8 faces
    to use forever what would they be.\r\n\r\n-FF"

  body: "As a graphic designer I have most times selected from a limited but hand-picked
    range of typefaces. I still have preferences for some of the classics but try
    to avoid those faces used by everyone at a time. For instance, if I may dare to
    say so, I have used Myriad and Lucida Sans frequently early in the Nineties when
    they were not yet that popular.\r\nHowever, by time I repeatedly find myself using
    my home-made fonts."

  body: "Kinda depends on what sort of graphic design you're doing. Pitching a product
    that will have a new style every year? Like after 1957 to the early '60s, every
    car had to have tail-fins. The bigger the better, until it suddenly stopped. So
    \"graphic design\" in those ads was a matter of \"style,\" too. If you know the
    product is going to change regularly, and/or there will be a new ad campaign every
    few months, I suppose you gotta be with it.\r\n\r\nNow if you look at a well-done
    book from the 1920s, you know it's dated, but that feeling soon disappears if
    you start reading it (no, not just look at it, read it).\r\n\r\nWhat's the point?
    In the small, underpaid world of book designers, most of the best use only a very
    few fonts. In the advertising business, you have to be timely. I don't know that
    business, but I'd assume using new fonts is considered important. IMSLTHO, book
    design is only a little bit about letterforms. Learning to *use* a font takes
    time. Here are a couple of names if that was your question -- Richard Eckersley,
    Rich Hendel . . .\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nHere's an interesting notion -- do designers
    pushing products that appeal to \"old money\" use Gotham?"

    identity standards. So a designer who gets most of his work from a few steady
    clients may find himself using the same fonts repeatedly.

    few typefaces.\r\n\r\nDo they use only one because of the price of typefaces?
    \r\n\r\nWhen they choose only one typeface, it's because they understand it better
    (instead of others) and in that way, they can make a full use of it?\r\n\r\nWhen
    doing identity design do they still use one typeface? What other \"tools\" do
    they use to achieve something unique?\r\n\r\nSo far i've got the following names:\r\n\r\nMassimo

  body: "Jason Santa Maria should not be on the list. His website is famous for having
    differing designs (and typefaces) for each page. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for using
    just a few typefaces is that one has to learn about them and through familiarity
    comes excellence. A hypothesis I find very appealing\u2026 It is in line with
    for instance Yves Klein\u2019s usage of blue, or Donald Judd\u2019s fascination
    with a restricted scale of shapes and materials.\r\n\r\nBut to be fair \u2014
    in the past designers were restricted by the limits of what print shops had available
    etcetera. Nowadays a designer has 120.000 typefaces to consider\u2026 (and in
    practice there are those twenty he knows that work and that will be used.)"

  body: "Most freelance graphic designers I know charge enough of a fee to be able
    to buy most any font/typeface their clients approve. And when potential clients
    ask for some graphic thumbnail to be done up asap it is best to be able to understand
    the clients business characteristics and their market place as part of the 'letter
    shape' design decision(s). For instance, way finding signage for a veterinarian
    hospital as opposed to promotional/sale packages of a saddlery (both entities
    by-the-way in business of animals). \r\n\r\nUsing just one typeface for the brief
    example above not only limits/restricts/blurs the client's brands, but will also
    dummy down graphic design as a whole into nothing more than a grunt.\r\n\r\nIn
    my humble opinion of course.\r\n\r\nHappy New Year to you also :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
