  of the 'beat generation' please.  In an ideal world they'd be US fonts circa 1948-55
  but the date isn't an essential feature~ far more important is the 'beat' feel of
  the font! \r\n\r\nI'm throwing this one open to you folks- any and all feedback
  very gratefully received!\r\n\r\n Many thanks\r\n\r\n Steve \r\n"

  body: The City Lights publication of Howl in 1955 uses Albertus and is one of the
    most distinctive and recognisable publications of the beat era.

  body: Your local library probably has it. It's also at Amazon, or download it from
    iTunes (https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/the-prisoner-classic/id336608727).
    Make sure you get the 1960s version (usually called the "classic" version), not
    the 2009 remake.

    so caught the reruns in the UK in the 80's. A classic series- thanks for taking
    the time to put the iTunes link ;)\r\n\r\nOldNick- now that's a new one on me-
    I like it! Would be great in a poster format...\r\n\r\n.00 - top suggestion. The
    beat and jazz do indeed go hand in hand. Some beautiful typefaces on those records.
    I'll get on it...\r\n\r\nSo many great ideas...I love this forum. Thanks one and
