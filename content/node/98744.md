  part? \r\n\r\nSection 1-5\r\n\u2022 a two-column asymmetrical grid is perfect here.
  These sections are text and image heavy, but I have between 10-12 pages for each
  section.\r\n\r\nSection 6 through 20\r\n\u2022 a two-column symmetrical grid is
  perfect here. These sections are more text heavy with fewer images, but I only have
  4 pages max for each of these sections. \r\n\r\nAnd due to conflicts in various
  content, small book format, and needs for some space in the layout, I can't just
  use a two column layout for the whole book. Would look great in some sections but
  really dense in others. Already working with 9 for body copy and 11 for leading,
  and I was asked not to go lower than either number.\r\n\r\nThe best solution so
  far is to use a different grid for each section. Thankfully, Section 1-5 is in one
  overall 'chapter' of the book, and sections 6-20 are in another 'chapter.' OR I
  could use a 6 column grid and do a 3/3 or  4/2 split as needed. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"

  body: "I don't see any problem with having a two-column symmetric section, a two-column
    asymmetric section and a single column section in the same publication, either
    a single book or a journal or magazine. \r\n\r\nIf that presents the text the
    best way, then that's what you should do. Can't tell you how many books we've
    done with two grids, and three or even four are occasionally used  when images
    get thrown in. Or boxed, sidebar text. Etc.\r\n\r\nI'd say that multiple grids
    are fine when they're used to resolve an author's affectations, the (knowledgeable)
    design police only get involved when it's a design affectation."

  body: "Thanks everyone. I ended up finalizing a 6 column grid with a 3/3 split on
    some sections and a 4/2 split in others. If the layout police show up, I'll feign
    insanity. \r\n\r\nThe grid is attached. The book itself is only 5.375 x 8 inches
    (13.6525 x 20.32 cm), and this grid seems to be the most functional.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gridsnthangs_4072.png]"

    an overall consistency of the general style, I don't think you'll have a problem.
    You just want avoid having it look like two different designers did the the two
    sections and they are inconsistent in fonts, color palette, etc."

  body: Amen JamesM! Master pages & styles have already been set up. Maybe I am being
    very OCD...but this is my first major publication, and I am examining every detail
    & decision I make under the proverbial design microscope.
