body: This was a logo my grandfather created for his machine shop back in the early
  1900's. This was the only scan I had from an old business card, and I was hoping
  to recreate it in vector format so I can use it in other, larger applications (i.e.
  T-shirts, etc). I'm mostly hoping to find out what the script font is, but if you
  know what the other two sans are that would be great also. Thanks.

  body: "Some excellent finds Ryuk. A fair approximation can be made with Monoment
    for the lower case and one of the following five for the capital S -- in no particular
    order as to best fit: Japan, Cocktail Shaker, Banana, Satisfaction, or Sandra.
    Editing can make it closer.\r\nDon"

  body: 'Thanks Don. Unfortunately, my attempt to find a good alternative is most
    probably useless as Jon needs to recreate his grandfather''s logo perfectly. His
    best chance is probably to start with the best scan he could, set sample color
    mode to grayscale, adjust levels to get a proper B&W artwork, vectorize it and
    refine the whole thing up manually. '

  body: "I agree Ryuk that if only the letters for the logo are needed then the best
    way is to create it from scratch based on a scan of the card. If more letters
    are needed Monoment would work as a source of ideas. The staccato tops of the
    lower case and the flattened lower case echo the letters in the card.  But it
    took significant editing to approximate the card:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TestRevisedMonoment_3874.jpg]\r\nDon"
