  body: Yeh, I know they might be customised. But as we all have got a "mother" and
    a "father", I guess these customised typefaces must have roots as well. I don't
    think they came completely out of the blue. So I'd even be happy to know the roots
    of these types. Suggestions welcome...

    that's the whole point -- they're <em>not</em> customised existing fonts, but
    custom designed logos, which means it's less obvious to find a \"master\" design.
    They might be based on a certain type style, but not necessarily on a specific
    typeface."
