  much, because everybody knows the role typography have had in the music industry,
  specially in the vinyl age (for me at least). Fortunately I will not ask for some
  Britney Spears typo style, but for a Paul McCartney's one: I was just searching
  for some good song to makes me happy in youtube, and I found it.\r\n\r\nhttp://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=cm2YyVZBL8U&feature=related\r\n\r\nSomebody
  knows which is the typography just at the begining? I find it gorgeous, and, yes
  it's true : it's a classyc type from the 70's in all kind of folk-songwritter's
  \ LP, but I don't know its name.\r\n\r\nI'm working actually in a library logo ...
  and I think I got it. :)\r\n\r\nIn any case, I hope you enjoy the music. I'm sure
  you'll do :)"
