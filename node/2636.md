body: Here is the beginnings of a sans family designed for the possibility of use
  with my recent serif project. In many ways it is unrelated though. It isn&#39;t
  just a version with the serifs ripped off. The x-height is the same, cap height
  the same, asscenders shorter, decenders slightly shorter. The forms are a complete
  redraw. <BR> <BR>The thing I especially like about this sans as a stand alone project
  is the black weight. It developes a playful brushy quality that is evident, but
  only hinted at in the regular weight. It is that quality I&#39;m hoping will differentiate
  this offering. Some of the black glyphs were inspired by a collaborative project
  between Kyle Johnston and I that is now growing cobwebs.  <BR> <BR>I am not even
  through the lower case yet, so there is a long road ahead. Before embarking, I wanted
  to get your impressions. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23701.gif"

  body: 'Pretty nice. The only negative I see is the slight backslant. You might nudge
    the forms half a degree forward to counter it. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;d do the weight
    distribution differently: make the Bold slightly darker, make the Heavy between
    the burrent Heavy and Black, and go even blacker with the Black. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    I think you might increase the &#34;dance&#34; in the lighter weights as well
    - otherwise this might end up as a &#34;me too&#34; design. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'In my humble but subjective opinion for this type in concrete: <BR> <BR>-
    I see too much inequality between the height of the lc-L with respect to the lc-T
    <BR>- Also I see something strange in the ties of the lc-R <BR>  <BR>  <BR>ODA

  body: These are two efforts to make the regular more painterly. Unfortunatly I like
    neither as well as the original. Grrr. Will keep sketching. Meanwhile, I&#39;ll
    finish the lower case to get the sense of it in text. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23712.gif"

  body: I could see using this as secondary to Underware&#39;s Sauna. Sort of a sans
    version ... sort of.  <BR> <BR>Should you go too playful? Your &#34;revise 1&#34;
    strikes me as too soft. Perhaps you could create the soft variants as an alternate
    font?  <BR> <BR>I agree that it does appear to be slanting to the left a bit.

  body: Yes, I like the honesty of the original&#39;s terminals more. The key might
    be to introduce irregularity instead of &#34;formal movement&#34; - a tricky thing
    for sure. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Very nice, Randy. <BR>IMO the original version is better too. <BR> <BR>The
    &#39;r&#39; is good, maybe just a bit too wide. The flaring concept is nice &#40;interestingly,
    I&#39;ve been playing with something similar&#41;. I like the softness in your
    regular version, I don&#39;t think you need it to be softer &#40;maybe in a display
    alternate version, as Tiffany suggested&#41;. <BR>
