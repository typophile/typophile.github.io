body: I'm applying for entry level finance and accounting positions and want to know
  what fonts graphics professionals would think best. From the previous posts I gather
  that serifs pair well with sans serifs and that layout is more important than design.  I
  am still wondering though, what fonts work best together for a traditionally conservative  field?  I
  would really appreciate any advice. Thank you in advance.

  body: "For a business resume I wouldn't stress too much about the font. The most
    applications and resumes (from non designers) I receive have been set with Verdana
    or Times New Roman and they do the job just fine for what it is. (Yes, I know
    Verdana is meant to be for web only)\r\n\r\nI would go for something neutral within
    the standard font packages like Palatino, Janson, Garamond etc and then maybe
    some 12 pt Helvetica for the headings. Just keep it simple.\r\n\r\nYou should
    also consider that if you email a word document and the receiver doesn't have
    the same font on his/hers computer it will chance the layout. So always email
    a pdf rather than a word-document if you don't print it.\r\n\r\nI'm sure some
    of my fellow type geeks can give some great advise as to why a beautiful font
    like [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100017
    | Mercury]] can make it more legible and elegant, but I really don't think it
    matters too much in a business resume \u2013 as long as you never use Comic Sans.\r\n\r\n"
