  files one for each layer but I have no idea how to generate the typeface. What I
  want to create is a typeface that overlaps my four designs making possible to choose
  4 different colours for each of them.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    So you have to make\r\neach layer a separate font, and the <em>user</em> has to
    overlay\r\nthem and color them.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    precision work to get everything to snap together, though.  ;-)"
