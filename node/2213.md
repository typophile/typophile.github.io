  body: If it helps any, the logo was probably designed in New York City &#40;the
    company was based in Brooklyn, then Long Island&#41;.  I&#39;m less certain about
    the timeline, but I would think &#40;from company history, not from the font itself&#41;
    that it was possibly designed in the mid-1930&#39;s? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance.  :-&#41;
