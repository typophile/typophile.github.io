  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all;

I'm a product designer going for another degree in graphic/communication design. Forgive me if I'm slightly behind the curve -- I'm trying to learn a lot at once and am taking it all very seriously. Although I've been working with type/graphics for years I am now trying to be more rigorous about my choices. 

I'm working on a logo and graphic standards for a small NYC branding firm who does projects from very hip to very square (art to corporate). I keep coming back to Sackers Roman as a foundation for their logo/ID work. I think it's a beautiful typeface and the company does have a sort of eclectic/vintage-meets-modern/cool vibe about them. 

My question is whether there are other typefaces which are not quite so 'old fashioned' as Sackers -- perhaps a newer typeface that would be more appropriate for titling and larger text/words/logo. Or are people of the opinion (and I know there are many) that there's a basic elegance to the old faces that trancends the vintage signifiers. Bottom line is that I just don't want to be too 'costumey' if you know what I mean.

Second question, is if I do use Sackers Heavy Roman, what is a good companion face for body text? I am imagining something like Trade, although again, I wonder if the Sackers/Trade thing is going to make everything feel to 'vintage'?
Any thoughts would be appreciated. And please be gentle, I've been beaten to a pulp over on DPReview forums for posting as a novice.

Many thanks.
Rem.</div>

Beaten to a pulp? That isn't right.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks so much - I love that idea - I love Mrs. Eaves - in fact it was one of the faces I have on my list. I love the Priori family too, although I think it might be a bit much to do a Priori Serif / San Serif combo. 

Just incidentally, can someone articulate what makes Mrs. Eaves such a lovely face?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah you'll never get a consensus here. I love the letterforms, and especially the italic, but also recognize it's limitations as a text font, due to it's small x-height and general width. You'll find a lot more info and opinions in these threads.

		<div class="commentbody">Sackers heavy roman as headline text (ie, as in the title of a paragraph - set 20pt)-- is it bad form to use another serif font on the same page as body copy or a smaller headline? In other words, is Sackers Roman so distinctive that it sort of ruins the chance for any other serifs to live on the same page?</div>
