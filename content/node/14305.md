  to be specific) into a bitmap to achieve the desired effect. I think 9 pixels is
  the correct amount, not too sure on that... Do I need some sort of program? I'm
  on a mac with Adobe CS. \r\n\r\nBasically I want to turn my Geneva into this...
  (see attachment)\r\n\r\nDo I need to alter the font or will I be creating a new
  one entirely (with the use of a different program).\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,
  i'm not terribly educated on this subject.\r\n\r\n"
