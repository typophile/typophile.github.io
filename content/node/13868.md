  reading the above in a friend's design magazine, I've been inspired to use other,
  more contemporary typefaces for some of my work instead of relying on safe bet 'classics'
  such as univers, helvetica, sabon etc.\r\nare there any currently available faces
  that stand up to say, the popular use of 'classics' ? \r\nand for what would you
  recommend your choice for (the setting of books, magazine layouts, etc.) ?"

    some of the new work that is going on out there. Go to P22 this month they have
    a special on those books. Also visit Emigre their Vista typeface is lovely.

    more in depth article regarding it, but the situation today of <em>\"Typographers
    are far ahead of their designer counterparts\"</em> demonstrates how effective
    a tool U&lc magazine was for decades.\r\n\r\nI promise to take this up at another
    time and not here and now.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If we think in terms of equivalents, it will be tough to replace the classics,
    although traditional-style faces like Quadraat, Scala, Miller or Minion stand
    comparison with anything that's gone before.\r\n\r\nMore pertinently, new types
    can be used in new ways.\r\nFor instance, I recently came across one of my faces,
    Beaufort, used in the headlines of the UK \"Bird Watcher\" magazine. What caught
    my interest was the way the art director had combined different sizes of the same
    font in headline words. Because of the \"infinite\" sharpness of the serifs (thanks
    to PostScript), it looked like optical scaling, because the serifs are equally
    sharp at different sizes. This is not a style of setting that I anticipated when
    I designed the typeface, and it may not be to everybody's taste. But it shows
    a progressive relationship between new types and contemporary graphic design."

  body: 'Nick, your Brown Gothic face I would consider a great alternative to Franklin
    Gothic. I would also say that there are far too many other great type designs
    out there to only fall on the crutch of classic faces. Classics will always be
    classics...try watching a movie from the 70''s or 80''s that you have a fond memory
    of, its almost guaranteed not to be the way you quite remembered it. '

    3 threads contain many links to new, terrific typefaces and type designers. Some
    standouts, in case those aren't covered: Stormtype.com, Hoefler & Frere-Jones,
    Feliciano Type Foundry, Umbrella Type foundry, Matthew Carter, FontBureau, PampaType,...\r\n\r\nSee?
    I must concur: 2005 is the right time for graphic designers to embrace and make
    use of the incredible wealth of new, excellent typefaces that are available with
    unprecedented convenience. There's no excuse for tired typography anymore. In
    fact, some of the new designs are so good, they should really become the new classics.\r\n\r\nSpecifically,
    here's a list of old (ignore or delete), followed by new - buy online, some from
    the original designers!\r\n\r\nTimes -- Laurentian\r\nBembo --  Bembo Book, FTF
    Merlo\r\nCaslon -- Clifford\r\nCentaur -- Adobe Jenson \r\nOptima -- Optima Nova\r\nHelvetica
    -- FTF Flama/FTFGrotzec\r\nPalatino -- FF Maiola\r\nCommercial Script -- Bickham
