body: "I am preparing a hardcover of 18th-century French garden architecture, illustrated
  with elevational watercolors of selected buildings. The artwork is contemporary
  and is rendered with extreme photorealism and will be reproduced on a white ground.
  Secondary illustrations will be period paintings, architectural and garden plans
  and views, portraits and engravings. There will be no photography to break this
  immersion in the Ancien Regime. \r\n\r\nThe texts are thoroughly researched but
  written with an engaging rather than scholarly intent and will be 10-11 pt., fully
  justified. Three-line inset caps will open chapters, so display capitals are very
  important. Titles and headers will be printed in a second color, yet to be chosen.
  The book has a simple, minimalist design with generous margins that accentuate the
  use of white space, and this echoes the presentation of the drawings. \r\n\r\nI
  am looking for an appealing, classic typeface for the texts other than a Garamond
  (I like Garamond Premier very much but have used it before) or a Caslon (too rounded,
  and also used for a previous book). Also a handsome italic swash for chapters and
  titles.\r\n\r\nFor lack of a better description, I'd like a text font that is something
  a bit out of the ordinary that does not call too much attention to itself. I've
  looked at Berling and like it but find it a tad generic, and Book Antiqua's italic,
  though the caps are too vertical and brittle.\r\n\r\nFor titles, Adobe Centaur italic
  swash is handsome but more antique than French. I also find Andrade appealing but
  with too much flourish.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for this project would be extremely
  welcome. I am new member of this forum and discovered it while looking for a Bodoni
  font for a previous book, and had the remarkable good fortune to learn of LT Gianottan
  Light, which was the perfect solution for the project. I hope the members here can
  point me toward other beautiful fonts such as this."

  body: "You probably already considered Fournier, as it is such an obvious candidate.\r\n\r\nTrinite
    is also a lovely font, at least at text size. The \"swash\" is made up with an
    extender character, and works better with some letters than others.\r\n\r\nI am
    curious why using a font once rules it out for more use. Most of us have to use
    a font many times before we can use it to best effect."

  body: "Stephan, both Clifford and Farnham are too bold and angular for this project,
    but Clifford is very handsome and I'm glad to have found it.\r\n\r\nAs for Caslon
    being too round, I'd used Adobe's Caslon for the last book by these authors and
    it was perfect for it, but the o a d c q etc. are very full and give the impression
    that the point size is actually larger than it is. Most Garamond faces have the
    opposite effect, looking finer than they actually are. "

  body: "charles_e, Fournier is too obviously archaic for this project, I don't want
    to give the impression that the book is trying to be of the period, but Trinite,
    especially the roman text, is extremely appealing. A truly beautiful font. The
    italics though are the rub, as they are not at all French in spirit. Lovely, though.\r\n\r\nSUF,
    Conrundum is definitely a candidate, I'll experiment with it but it may be too
    bold on the page. Kingfisher is also very strong, though slightly hard-edged.
    Thank you for pointing them both out."

  body: 'I second Corundum, but don''t forget Sabon (from Linotype with oldstyle figures),
    a very classic, reliably elegant face used in many museum settings. Buccardi has
    an intriguing funkiness though the base weight may be a tad heavy, which is not
    the case with Sabon. Monotype Bulmer is a little too boring and English. Look
    at Celeste, Dante, Esta, Filosofia, Janson, Van Dijck, and Village--each offers
    a different take on what you need. Storm has a number of period Garamonds, but
    be very careful of them.  '
