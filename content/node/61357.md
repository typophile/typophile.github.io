    his friends (must be ancient, sorry):\r\n\r\nHey Fred, I just won a major prize
    in a raffle. It's a holiday in a luxury restort for myself and 10 of my best friends.\r\nCould

  body: Vinnie and Mike - face it, you're living on borrowed time. I predict that
    in sixty or seventy years we won't be hinting fonts any more. You'll be out of
    a job!
