  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all! I&rsquo;ve been a &ldquo;casual&rdquo; fan of type since my days in journalism school many years ago, in the mid eighties when &ldquo;desktop publishing&rdquo; was the hot term of the day.
Most recently, I inherited a LARGE collection of old wooden letterpress type, and I&rsquo;ve found myself falling in love with it&hellip; the original intent was to sell it all, but now I&rsquo;m much too enamored, and I want to sort it all and collect it. So I have two questions here, and although I know that this is not strictly a &ldquo;wood type&rdquo; forum, I think someone here can probably help me with two simple questions.
Most of the type is terribly &ldquo;pied,&rdquo; or scrambled, and while I realize it may take YEARS for an amateur to sort it all out, I&rsquo;m determined to try. First question: I keep running into these strange characters which look something like M&rsquo;s and N&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve never seen before. Can anyone tell me what these are, and possibly what type family they might belong to? (I&rsquo;ll try to insert a photo here).<img src="/images/old-images/samplecharacters_3847.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Second question: I want to clean up, preserve and display these pieces, and information on the care of wood type is terribly scarce online. So far, I&rsquo;ve only used compressed air to blow out some of the old dust and such. I found a recommendation for mineral spirits as a cleaner, and I&rsquo;ve tried that on a few samples&hellip; it really seems to help bring out the patina, but is not so effective as a cleaner. I know I should not put any kind of lacquer or varnish on the pieces, but what is the best way to clean and prepare for display?</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone and everyone for any little bit of guidance you can offer!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Re: what are these characters? Take your photo and flop it horizontally and you&rsquo;ll see that they&rsquo;re ffi and ffl ligatures. And, why would you want to clean the pieces unless you plan to print with them? Better to preserve the patina, IMHO, which you might also accomplish with linseed oil.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thank you nick! I swear I can&rsquo;t see the ffi/ffl, but I don&rsquo;t have that great an eye, so perhaps it will come to me if I stare long enough. With regard to cleaning, I want to display them in my home. I don&rsquo;t see myself buying a letterpress any time soon, but what little I have read has given me some sense of duty to preserving them, because I don&rsquo;t want to be &ldquo;that guy&rdquo; who ruined an old font for some future user by cleaning or polishing them incorrectly. Is linseed oil a better product than mineral spirits for this purpose, and will it do anything to ruin the type for future owners/users?</div>

Any clearer now?</p>
<p>Also, preserving the woodtype in its &ldquo;natural&rdquo; state is advisable. Ancient coin collectors prize the patina that their coins acquire with age, and woodtype as a relic should probably be treated the same. I have a modest collection of xenotype, ranginf rom 36 pt to 14&quot; in height, an linseed oil &ldquo;feeds&rdquo; the wood and gives it a little sparkle without damaging it in any way.</p>
