  body: "That's printed, right? On a needle printer probably. Looks like one of them
    badly printed receipts.\r\nThere are some fonts that approximate this aesthetic;
    one that springs to mind is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/synchro/\">Synchro</a>
    from Letraset. That's wider than your sample though, and doesn't factor in the
    irregularities of the printed letters.\r\nAlso try: Ray Larabie's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/fake-receipt/\">Fake
    Receipt</a> or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/telidon-ink/\">Telidon
    Ink</a>; the latter even has some 'print' irregularities."

    is similar.
