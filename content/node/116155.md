  Yarns]] on BBC TV, and assumed that the title font was URWArtGothic. But what's
  puzzling me is that the show was made in 1970s, and URW [[http://www.urwpp.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/source/schnellsuche_e.htd?searchchar=artgothic|say]]
  that ArtGothic was designed in 1995. \r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering if this is really
  another font, or if ArtGothic was based on an older font. It looks quite old in
  style..."

  body: "Your impression of old in style is correct. Art Gothic seems to have been
    originally produced by the Central Type Foundry of St. Louis, Missouri, in the
    19th century. As is noted in the info provided with a digital version made by
    HiH http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/art-gothic-hih/ The reference to
    1995 for the URW version refers to when it was digitized for URW.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks for finding this for me, Don! I read URW's "Art Gothic was designed
    by URW Studio in 1995." a bit too literally... :) I don't know what technology
    the BBC were using for video titles in 1977.
