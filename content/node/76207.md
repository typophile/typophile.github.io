  do people suggest I make to the design?

  body: What is it for & what does he hate? Without knowing what it is for we cannot
    really give any advice. If he really does totally hate it perhaps you need to
    start again from scratch.

  body: "Without knowing any background I couldn't say anything on the content etc.
    as said above.\r\n\r\nTo me though with know knowledge on the brief, the message
    looks lost in almost an optical illusion of the shapes?"

  body: "I find this hard to understand as 'a poster', posters originated as bold
    and clear pieces of print; this is confusing, uninformative and provides me with
    very little. Other than a passing glance I would be disinclined to give this any
    more of my time. \r\n\r\nMaybe work on some stronger type, more info and more
    simplicity in the repetition. I believe a concept is present but its far from
    complete, repeating and rotating what could essentially be a page with 4 words
    on it doesn't do it for me.\r\n\r\nSorry if that sounds negative but here's a
    few pointers:\r\n\r\n- Get the type to stand out more, larger/more swiss typeface.\r\n-
    Consider some colour unless you have a limited brief, maybe white background with
    black/red laid over?\r\n- Simplify the 'optical illusion' and try and make more
    of a stylish feature of it than what I dare call 'a mess'\r\n\r\n"

  body: Morph an old, 'weak', dull typeface into a new, 'strong', bright one?

  body: I agree with twiggy, particularly on the stronger swiss typeface. This serif
    seems lost and flimsy.
