  body: "As I understand it, they are hints towards the size or use they were designed
    for.\r\n\r\nFoo Caption will likely be tuned for sizes smaller than Foo Text;
    Foo Subtitle for larger text (say, subheadings) and Foo Display for larger still.\r\n\r\nI
    think it was Nick Shinn that stated in an older thread that a good typographer
    could mix and match 'em with abandon to make the text look good. This of course
    implies that plonkers like me had best stay with the recipe lest we reinvent Tendo
    Akane's cooking."

  body: "Here is what Adobe says about it: http://www.adobe.com/type/topics/opticalsize.html
    For each font, they provide more precise values. \r\n\r\nFor instance for <a href=\"http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1415\"><strong>Utopia</strong></a>
    \ they write: <cite>Utopia Std family contains faces designed for the following
    optical sizes: Caption: design size 8.0 points, for use from 6.0 to 8.9 points;
    Body Text: design size 11.0 points, for use from 8.9 to 13.0 points; Subhead:
    design size 18.0 points, for use from 13.0 to 20.0 points; Display: design size
    72.0 points, for use from 20.0 to 72.0 points</cite>\r\n\r\nFor <a href=\"http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1740\"><strong>Arno
    Pro</strong></a> they say: <cite>Arno Pro family contains faces designed for the
    following optical sizes: Caption: design size 8.0 points, for use from 5.9 to
    8.5 points; SmText: design size 10.0 points, for use from 8.5 to 10.9 points;
    Body Text: design size 12.0 points, for use from 10.9 to 14.0 points; Subhead:
    design size 18.0 points, for use from 14.0 to 21.5 points; Display: design size
    36.0 points, for use from 21.5 to 72.0 points</cite>."

  body: "In general, 'caption' is a design variation created to draw attention to
    text under a picture or image component in a layout.\r\n\r\nMany times the italic
    is just too visually different from the roman text (too cursive) so a special
    font is developed, with a slight angle and some cursive elements, overall, that
    distinguish the copy from the roman and draw the eyes attention to it. To put
    it another way, it looks more like a sloped roman font as opposed to a true cursive
    italic.\r\n\r\nA clever idea. I used it when I developed the new digital version
    of Fairfield for Linotype-Hell.\r\n\r\nSee link:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/aboutfonts/articles/situationaltypography/captions+part+2.htm\r\n\r\nCertainly,
    not a new idea... Matthew Carter used it, I believe, for a typeface he did for
    National Geographic.\r\n\r\nAnyway...\r\n\r\nAnd, for 'Display' you could tighten
    up the spacing between letters for a large display headline. But ideally, you
    should use a display font specifically created for this purpose. It incorporates,
    not just tighter inter-letter spacing but slightly lighter stems, hairlines, narrower
    body proportions, etc. to adjust the color overall to work better with the same
    font used for body text below it.\r\n\r\nLike the display fonts I developed for
    Electra. called 'Electra Display'... see link.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/363/electra-schriftfamilie.html?gclid=CJSlnPu7-qwCFcbd4AodYyp-Tg\r\n\r\nI
    hope this helps."
