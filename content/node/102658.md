body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nI am designing an essay book: 11 x 17 cm. I would like to give
  it an avant-garde look, a kind of mix between russian constructivism and the german
  avant garde in Germany in the 30's. El Lissitzky, John Heartfield, Bauhaus\u2026
  The best example of what I am looking for is Cristiana Couceiro, two images attached.\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/Cristiana-Couceiro-33.jpg]]\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/tumblr_lquhtcp2I71qa5y9j.jpg]]\r\n\r\nSo,
  I am looking for a couple of fonts working well together. I was thinking why essay
  books usually use serif fonts for body text, and sans \u2014in case of using a sans\u2014
  only for titles and page numbers. Is there a rule or is ok to use a serif for titles
  and sans for body text? In both cases, which fonts could give this look?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n
  \r\nT."
