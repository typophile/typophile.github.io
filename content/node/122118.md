body: "The evolution via writing facilitation of what we now consider lowercase forms
  out of monumental uppercase originals is well-documented. But I don't remember reading
  much about how eventually the two cases were combined to deliver text, and acquire
  the grammatical determinance we take for granted today. For example, how long did
  it take after the establishment of lowercase for this to happen? And did uppercase
  completely fall out of common use at any point? This applies not only to Latin but
  also Cyrillic, Greek and Armenian at least.\r\n\r\nAny elucidation would be most
  welcome.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Well, it is known that for the Latin alphabet, dual case script was a deliberate
    invention - it came about when Charlemagne sought to have a standard scribal hand
    created, and so it combined the original Roman monumental script for capital letters
    with a lower-case based on uncial.\r\n\r\nAccording to this page,\r\n\r\n[[http://learnrussian.rt.com/alphabet/the-history-of-the-cyrillic-alphabet/]]\r\n\r\nlower-case
    letters were added to Cyrillic by Peter the Great.\r\n\r\nAnd the Wikipedia article
    cited in the post above gives information on the origin of Greek lower-case as
    well. So far, I've found nothing on Armenian lower-case.\r\n\r\n...but now I remember
    that a few days ago, I came across something that mentioned that Bolorgir was
    originally the name for the Armenian minuscule hand, before it became applied
    to the traditional style of Armenian types."

  body: "Before minuscules were developed (Latin), there were uncial sorts used for
    body text in book production. To set captions, chapter initials, certain word
    or sentence beginnings and similar focal points inside the text against the common
    style, more \u201Cancient-style\u201D e.g. Roman capital shapes have been employed,
    more or less obvious/deliberate. I think there lies the origin of a dualistic
    behaviour which later became a bicameral canon.\r\n\r\nStill today the regular
    use of lower/uppercase is remarkably different in different languages.\r\nBut
    no country adopted the tricameral system of the old days as mandatory, this is
    the sad side of the story ;)"

  body: Sumner Stone did several presentations about this stuff years ago. His general
    theme was the increasing complexity of the Latin writing system, which has had
    letters, case, punctuation, figures, and styles (Italic, then Bold) folded in
    over the centuries. As pointed out above, manuscripts in Carolingian Europe used
    Lombardic and Uncial caps for initials and lead-in text blocks of the Carolingian
    minuscule that provided the model for our lower case. The cpas moved from a role
    of initials and emphasis into one of more general case (still effectively initials)
    over time.

    may be intended as a jest. But it wasn't clear from your post to me which tricameral
    system you meant - did you mean uppper and lower case and decorative initials?\r\n\r\nWhile
    I think that small capitals ought to be recognized as a third case, I don't see
    a benefit of having any rule for always using a third case similar to the rules
    that require the use of capital letters."
