  body: "Hey Eyad,\r\nI recommend uploading that PDF you mentioned. While this GIF
    file shows the general image, the resolution is lacking a bit. Something specific
    I want to see (and why I want to see the PDF) is the swelling connections in Eyadish
    Thin. Those look neat. But if you want more feedback, I think the PDF will be
    very useful.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Typophile!"
