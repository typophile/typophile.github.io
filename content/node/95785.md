  if there's a model for a 'fully functional' virtual movable type machine, where
  you'd have to set all of these voxelous type characters for fauxpress...\r\n\r\nand
  then I thought there should be an entire virtual library of 'liveable' virtual experiences
  encompassing a range or rare and antiquated production techniques of all kinds.\r\n\r\nand
  now I'm thinking about eating some fruit."

  body: "I've been interested in this, too, and have also considered a sort of virtual
    shop of virtual typesetting machines.\r\n\r\nI was reading up on how Linotype
    machines really worked (in detail), and wondered whether someone had written a
    simulator. I couldn't find one, so spent some time writing a very basic text-only
    simulator (in the Ruby language). I found I could easily code up the basic operations:
    a keyboard, a magazine, a spaceband box, an assembler, and a caster. The complications
    arise as you get closer to the physical nature of the machine, which is really
    several machines running at once, linked together via some complex timing.\r\n\r\nHaving
    just taken a short Monotype compositor workshop last weekend, I'm now thinking
    of coding a simulator for that machine, just for fun.\r\n\r\nSo I think there's
    some promise here, but it depends on whether you're just trying to codify essentially
    a mathematical model of a machine, or a full simulation with lots of moving parts.\r\n\r\n--John"

    body: "A Linotype simulator would be awesome! You could even include a mini-game
      of dodging virtual squirts! And maybe a penny-in-a-slug easter egg. Make sure
      to include \"hanging the elevator\" limitation when an operator would type so
      fast that the machine needed time to finish the casting cycle before a new line
      could be keyed. Getting to this point would give you a \"\"Smooth Operator\"
      achievement :)\r\n\r\nAdditional skins can account for different models."

    can be made...\r\nIf that kickstarter project moves to a tangible full-service
    letterpress printer, I'll be interested to follow their progress, but I'm not
    much for schlocky iPad experiences. Fun though!"

    once you got really good on the Model 25 you would earn the 34-channel auxiliary
    magazine to turn it into a Model 26.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, real experts could
    progress to non-Latin composing. I have a copy of the Linotype Devanagari manual."

    are also the folks who run Living Letter Press in Champaign, Illinois. They are
    about as letterpress-printy as you can get, and there is talk--if it hasn't been
    implemented already--of adding a function to the app that allows you to send your
    design to their shop to be made for reals.\r\n\r\n"

    a choice image or two from your Devanagari manual? (If you have them available,
    don't make an extra effort to scan them.)\r\nThanks Maurice, I like your face."

    the whole thing, but the PDF is >5 MB.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LTDevKeyboard_4927.jpg]\r\n\r\nFrom
    this illustration, you can see clearly the technological influence of the Linotype
    hot metal composing machine on Indian typography. Consonant conjuncts are mostly
    represented using so-called half-forms, rather than as ligatures, and even many
    full form letters are represented as half-form plus short a vowel sign. So, for
    example, to enter the Hindi letter <em>pa</em> \u092A you would need to hit two
    keys in sequence: 17 and 1."
