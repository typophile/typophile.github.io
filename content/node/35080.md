    Handschrift'</a>? It is a digitization of an old Art Nouveau era script typeface,
    so the time period is a good match for Carpenter.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    The drawback of these two is that they are more casual than Carpenter. If you
    want to maintain a more formal feeling, have a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/voluta_script_pro_ot/">Voluta
    Script</a>.

    Sparkling</a> always reminds me somehow on Carpenter. BTW, Viktor Solt is the
    designer of Voluta Script, too. '
