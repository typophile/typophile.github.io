body: I'm looking to pair up Meta with a sort of "quirky" serif. I plan to use the
  serif as headline and not body copy so I need something that will grab your attention
  in a fun, laid back way. Scala looks interesting but anyone know of others? Thanks.

    in progress or private use. \r\n\r\nWhat about Ronnia or Legato? They have a very
    nice heft to them in bold. Legato has a warm couchy feeling, Ronnia feels a bit
    more aspirational and is more cocktail-y.\r\n\r\nTiptoe has a great flow and I
    think t would play nice with Meta\r\n: http://vllg.com/KLTF/Tiptoe/mudTyper+Weights/"
