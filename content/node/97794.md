  University in Pennsylvania taking the communication design program. \r\nA group
  of us are taking part in a [[http://lehighvalley.startupweekend.org/|startup weekend]]
  and decided to begin the creation of a website (type-wich.com) to help with the
  creation of font combos for individuals looking to create anything in the design
  world. Or anywhere else really. \r\nSo, the way it will work, an individual will
  pick a font for the header and a list of fonts that will be possible good looking
  matches for the body. This way it can be quicker for designer to find another font
  that will work well with their first pick easier.\r\n\r\nThis site will also work
  as a filtration system to bring in most of the fonts from freelancers/type founders
  and smoothly dispense it to an individual. Because of this, there is a possibility
  for someone to see a font which they might like and buy it through us from the designer.\r\n\r\nSo,
  I am asking for ideas and opinions on what you guys/girls think of this idea!\r\n

    And they could then purchase a license to said fonts through this site? \r\n\r\nRhetorically:\r\nSo
    why are they called \"designers\" then if they need to rely on an outside service
    to select better font pairings? Isn't that why clients hire them? To make these
    design decisions?\r\n\r\nBack on topic:\r\nI personally think this won't succeed
    - you're going to be competing in a fairly compressed market filled with fairly
    large vendors who offer similar services (not necessarily the font pairing aspect,
    but being able to view fonts, see how they typeset, and then making them easily
    purchasable.) But the decision is up to you and who knows?"

    replace their own judgement) but what might make it really special is some kind
    of formula that recommends pairings (as opposed to simply brute-forcing canned
    lists of pairs).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Of course this sort of thing would only work very well if we had a robust
    feature-based font classification system, which we don't. Even then somebody would
    have to manually classify each font - I wouldn't expect it to do <em>that</em>
    on its own.\r\n\r\nBut even without a good font classification system such an
    algorithm might still serve as a fallible guide that gives ideas, many of which
    a user would reject.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    wouldn\u2019t worry about how your site assesses which fonts combine well.\r\nThat\u2019s
    curation and market research, not design.\r\nAs a design student, you will get
    the most out of your project by designing the site to show users how two fonts
    selected will look in various settings.\r\nMany type foundries already have this
    kind of functionality, which you can use as a benchmark.\r\n\r\nAs for choosing
    your short-list of faces and matchmaking their hook-ups, that's something you
    should do through your own research of typography, rather than looking for some
    automated process, which will not develop your knowledge and taste in typography."

    taught type design at a number of design schools, as part of a B.Des or similar
    program. It\u2019s one of the more dry, technical subjects in their curriculum,
    and many students hate it, no matter what. Being forced to learn about sidebearings
    and alignment zones in Fontlab (a dif\uFB01cult application that none of them
    are likely to use professionally) is too \u201Calgorithmic\u201D for many of them.
    I\u2019ve tried a number of different approaches, and those where there is less
    emphasis on technical rigor and more on open-ended invention and personal expression
    are preferred by students\u2014although I don\u2019t believe, as you say Hrant,
    they offer quite such deep insight into typography. So one strives for balance.\r\n\r\nAs
    this project has been described, there is plenty of opportunity for creative analysis
    and categorization of type forms in designing a \u201Ccombo\u201D site. My advice
    was simply not to get sucked (or forced!) into spending a lot of time \uFB01guring
    out a complex seemingly objective formula for type categorizating and matching,
    but rather to take it as a given, becuase the point of the exercise is to design
    a web site, not to develop a system of typeface classi\uFB01cation. \r\n\r\nBut
    perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps that\u2019s where graphic design is headed.\r\n \r\n"
