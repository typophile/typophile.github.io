So here goes nothing&hellip; this is really my first attempt ever at designing a typeface and I&rsquo;m sure that these characters are riddled with beginners' mistakes. I would appreciate any comments you can give: complements, criticism, and/or anything in between.</p>
<p>Tentatively the name is &ldquo;Abodwo&rdquo;, a word meaning &lsquo;peace&rsquo; in Twi [assuming that my friend didn&rsquo;t lie to me]. It is still in the rudimentary stages of design and I have only posted the glyphs that I am somewhat-okay with.<!--break--></p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/abodwo_6718.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Currently I am especially unhappy with the <strong>e</strong> and the <strong>f</strong>, but if you see any others that just scream &ldquo;FIX ME NOWWW!&rdquo;, let me know. I&rsquo;ll be working on this whenever I have a spare moment between my final examinations, so hopefully it won&rsquo;t take too long for me to make corrections&hellip; but no promises!</p>

I&rsquo;m a beginner too as I think you know, so take with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;r'&rsquo;s &hellip;arm? ear? whatever you call that nonvertical part seems too light to me.
&lsquo;k'&rsquo;s arm and leg both seem too light, too tapered, and the leg too casually curved
&lsquo;j&rsquo; tail&rsquo;s taper seems similarly out of place.
&rsquo;d&rsquo; looks narrow next to &lsquo;b&rsquo;
&lsquo;o&rsquo; looks a bit diamond-shaped to me; is that intentional?</p>
<p>I like the character of this a lot. 
Some of the bowls have a very appealing shape, and I especially like the ascenders - I think they can be a distinctive feature of the face without being distracting or unintegrated.</p>
<p>Keep it up!</p>

<p>In addition to what Craig pointed out&hellip;</p>
<p>The bowl of the &lsquo;b&rsquo; looks too wide towards the bottom.
The stroke weights need adjusting. The straight stems are maybe a touch too thin compared to the curved strokes of the bowls of &lsquo;a&rsquo;, &rsquo;d', etc. The &lsquo;g&rsquo; looks too heavy. &lsquo;o&rsquo; looks a bit light compared to the bowls. The middle stroke of &lsquo;e&rsquo; could stand thinning.
Conventionally, between the inner diagonals of &lsquo;w&rsquo;, the right stroke should be heavier than the left.</p>
<p>You might want to think about an overall plan of distributing weight on your strokes; letters like &rsquo;s' suggest emphasizing the horizontals near the baseline and the x-height. Take a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_balance_1/">FF Balance</a> to see what I mean.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>

<p><img src="/images/old-images/abodwo-0_5034.2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now looking at this, the &rsquo;d' may still look a little too skinny.</p>
<p>eliason:  Thanks for your suggestions! I hope that I fixed the &lsquo;j&rsquo;, &lsquo;k&rsquo;, and &lsquo;r&rsquo;. The diamond-shaped &lsquo;o&rsquo; was definitely unintentional, and I tried to make it rounder. Both you and Jongseong mentioned this letter, so hopefully it&rsquo;s better now.</p>
<p>Jongseong:  I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what you meant by &ldquo;distributing weight&rdquo;, but I tried to normalize the stroke weights in all of the characters. Tell me if I understood you wrong or if I still haven&rsquo;t corrected the problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This is coming along nicely.
I do think d is still too narrow.
Are the counters of m equal in width? They look unbalanced but that may be the rasterizing of the graphic file.
Maybe extend k&rsquo;s arm higher and further (I think it can have some &ldquo;overshoot&rdquo;). To me this k still may be a bit of a misfit but it&rsquo;s better suited than the previous version.
You may want to thin the &ldquo;crossbar&rdquo; part of e a bit.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Much improved! I still think &lsquo;b&rsquo; looks too wide next to the &rsquo;d', so you should try equalizing the apparent size of the two. With the new &lsquo;o&rsquo;, the &rsquo;d' is the one that looks rather narrow.</p>
<p>By the weight distribution, I mean an overall plan for which strokes would be thicker than which strokes. In the final paragraph of <a href="http://typophile.com/files/ff%20-%20legato_about.pdf">this PDF about FF Legato</a>, different stroke weight distribution models for Univers, FF Balance, and FF Legato are compared, with an accompanying picture.</p>

<p><img src="/images/old-images/abodwo-0_4332.3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As for the &lsquo;k&rsquo;, I made some alternatives. I&rsquo;m not too comfortable with the third version, but maybe I&rsquo;ll warm up to it with time&hellip;</p>

<p>Hopefully by my next post I will have some capital letters designed but I&rsquo;m not promising anything. I still have quite a few finals left and school doesn&rsquo;t end till the 12th.</p>
