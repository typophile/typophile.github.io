    start by doing a search through the work of David Carson, work you way over to
    Roger Black, back down the road a bit to Fabian Baron, and turn left toward Margo
    Chase."

  body: I realized that you could also look at the history of P22 Type Foundry as
    well as Erik Spiekermann. (Although none of the designers/foundries I've mentioned
    should be relegated to the 90s as they all continue to do great work.)
