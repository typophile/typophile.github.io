  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Whilst googling I stubled upon two sites, eaglefonts and fontslog that offer truetype and opentype fonts respectively. And I noticed they offer a lot of original, certainly not free, typefaces. It seems to be a decent website, not spammed over. But no information about copyrights or anything. They only offer this BS line, with obviously no substance whatsoever: 

"All fonts on the FontsLog site remain copyright of their respective owners. All fonts can be found elsewhere on the Internet, either as individual fonts or as complete font sets and are believed to be in the public domain. If you find any font on FontsLog for which you are the copyright holder, under the conditions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act you may submit a Take-down Request by clicking the red flag  beside the font name on the font's detailed view page. We will endeavour to investigate your request and take the appropriate action ASAP."

They obviously stretch the definition of public domain until it includes just about anything. You are all warned. As for copyright owners and foundries: shouldn't action be taken to close this down?

PS Sorry moderators I don't intend to post links for people to download obviously but I do feel the need to inform about these sites. Please correct me if I'm wrong

If you click on the Opentype link on eaglefonts it will take you to fontslog. If you are on fontslog and click on the Truetype link it will take you to eaglefonts.

They are both hosted at ThePlanet in Houston, TX but are hiding behind a Private Registration organization in the Netherlands.

And FontShop for showing up in the Google text ads. You guys need to give Google shit about running your ads on these pirate font web sites before 2,000,000 people read a story on BoingBoing or Slashdot telling them that it’s OK to pirate fonts because foundries are the ones paying the pirate sites’ hosting bills!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It sucks that so many font sites throw away the licence agreements. Pursuing these assclowns causes more harm than good. If I'm spending time getting hundreds of free font sites to include my EULA, I'm not making new fonts. Screw it. The only time I bother is if a site is offering a significant number of my commercial fonts for free and telling visitors that they're freeware. Usually they take them down if I ask politely. If they don't leave contact info, I just shut their sites down. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually that's a very good point about the ironic ads. I bought licenses for some monotype fonts, and then a while later saw apparently similar "public domain" fonts on that site - my first though was that I'd just wasted a few hundred bucks! Normally, I would've just assumed they were pirate versions, but the ads definitely give the site an air of legitimacy.

It's mainly a problem because Google('s ads/searches) are totally complicit with piracy. It's the larger places with a more traditional b2c/b2b mindset who buy the Google ads. Most foundries are small and keep things close and manageable.</div>

For instance:
http://www.fontslog.com/handsomepro-classic-otf-5613.htm

Nonetheless, I do think the statement that "All fonts found at FontsLog.com were collected from other public domains and were believed to be free for download..." is disingenuous.

Putting the onus on the publisher to correct copyright infractions is a lazy way to do business for what is clearly a commercial font, as Shinntype has been publishing commercial-only fonts for 10 years, and there is an "all rights reserved" copyright notice in the font info.

What this business should do to be entirely reputable is open up every font it re-distributes, in FontLab or whatever, and inspect the copyright info.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I also noticed that Linotype are very activily using google ads. Just type fonts in google and they are always there, and several font sites that feature adwords also have linotype ads, and apprently not only the legal nice ones...

I noticed that you could even try typing Linotype or another foundry in the search box and get a list of fonts, as the search also recognises copyright strings in the fonts.

I'm glad they are responsive to your requests Nick, but it should really be the other way around. What bother me is the feeling of legitimacy that is created. This might trick unknowing designers into using them. But I guess that any (free)font site that has no info about itself, it's organisation structure etc. should be suspect. But I guess this kind of thing is very hard to crack down in the world of internet.</div>
