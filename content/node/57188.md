body: "Hey friends,\r\n\r\nA client I've been working with KT Tape (Kinesiology Therapeutic
  Tape), a professional-grade athletic tape has requested a rework of a typographic
  logo I did for them a while back. They want the logo to be more emotive and human.
  They said they have gotten comments that the big K in their current logo reminds
  people of K-Mart. (Not good!)\r\nThe second image is a mockup of exactly what they
  asked for in a new logo...a logo based on a victorious human form! I feel like this
  approach is dated and I prefer the old logo. I suggested we meet in the middle and
  just do a more stylized K or KT using curved lines. What do you guys think?\r\n\r\nJ."

  body: "This sounds like a fun project. If the old logo looks like Kmart, the new
    mockup looks like a bajillion other companies (also, why is it an X?). Usually,
    the best way to deal with these really narrow formal instructions is to take a
    step back and figure out why your client wants a \"victorious human form\" rather
    than the old simple, straight lined, typographic solution. Do they want to communicate
    victory? That they need to communicate that they make tape for humans as opposed
    to paper? Do they require a more \"unique\" icon rather than simple typography?
    Or are they just kind of bored with the old one? Perhaps they think it's too cold
    and stiff? \r\n\r\nIt could also help if you can show them examples of other company's
    logos both in their market and ones that look like their desired direction. \r\n\r\nFYI,
    this should go on the design board next time. "

    than a k in the logo.\r\n\r\nhave you tried making the position of theperson more
    semifore-like?\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: "Quickest way to kill the Kmart connection would be to ditch the red. I like
    the KT mark.\r\n\r\nI agree with you about the new logo: generic, looks like an
    X, dated approach, etc. Also, the typography leaves something to be desired. The
    T is so weak, and it's one of the key letters! I also think the K is a bit weak,
    too."
