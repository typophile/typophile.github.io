  doing an identity\r\nwhere I want to render English words in an arabic style, not
  using the actual arabic characters.\r\nI've already got a load of arabic patterns
  and typefaces as a starting point.\r\n\r\nI may be going for a crest type logo so
  any strong examples of contemporary crests would be interesting.\r\n\r\nEd\r\n "
