  body: 'Charles,  <BR> <BR>The Adobe Glyph List &#40;AGL&#41; is not an appropriate
    source for glyph names at all. You should always use the Adobe Glyph List For
    New Fonts &#40;AGLFN&#41;.  <BR><a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/aglfn13.txt"

    <BR> <BR>Small caps glyphs should always be named by putting a suffix to the glyph
    name of the base glyph. Fontlab Ltd. recommends using the suffix &#34;.smcp&#34;
    for small caps glyphs, although other suffixes e.g. &#34;.sc&#34; or &#34;.small&#34;
    are possible as well.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Hdotbelow&#34; is not listed in the AGLFN
    so &#34;uni1E24&#34; is the appropriate glyph name for the basic glyph. The small
    caps glyph should be then named &#34;uni1E24.smcp&#34;, &#34;uni1E24.sc&#34; or
    &#34;uni1E24.small&#34;.  <BR> <BR>In your case, you may also be interested in
