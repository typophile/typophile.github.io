  anybody know a tutorial on creating a font from scratch or good expertise advice
  will do fine! I have a greta dell of experience in grafikart but I think a missed
  a little basics in creating a good font. I\xB4m mostly selflearned and done it in
  my way but I think I created shapes i a to complikated way. There ar of course basics
  that I do know that you first skecth the font on paper, but there are many questions,
  do experts for example use \"crosslinepaper\"Grid lines? (sorry my english, from
  Sweden) then scan it and draw it out in Illustrator. But there are many ways to
  do it in Illustrator. I just learned to use grids and \"snap to grid\" well I think
  you know what I mean now.\r\nMayby I am to perfektionist I dont know. I just want
  a good rutin and perhaps a new way to design letters in more easier way.\r\n\r\nMy
  wish is if there is a basic videotuttorial (or other will do) from A to Z that really
  describes in detail how to acomplish a high quality font."
