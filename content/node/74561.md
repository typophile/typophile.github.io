  body: Wow, how grotesque. "Jimmy Buffett's" isn't a font, but handwriting. "Flamingo"
    is the custom logo for the Hotel/Casino, however House's Las Vegas Fabulous (http://www.houseind.com/fonts/lasvegasfonts/viewfonts)
    is similar in style. "At the Las Vegas", I'm sure you already know, is Arial.
