    their typefaces/families in the short period of the course! Really impressed &
    I would like to have all of them!

    it disappointing that you apparently prefer to keep re-hashing your preconceived

    as questions."

    not \"suspiciously good\", but in most cases to me they are (especially when the
    \"style\" of the teachers consistently shows through so strongly). Coupled with
    KABK's known emphasis on using physical tools in normative ways, I feel safe in
    maintaining this view (while always remaining open to improving or even correcting
    it).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think Nina is right to put Hrant down there, but honestly I tend to agree
    with Hrant's premise\u2014since earlier today, actually. I've always been impressed
    with the work coming from the KABK media course and in fact I'm planning on getting
    my degree there when I've finished my BA in graphic design.\r\n\r\nHowever, today
    I saw something which gave me the exact feeling Hrant expressed rather clumsily
    here. I'm actually hesitant to point you to this designer's work though; I'm not
    sure if it's justified for me to state this person's name, so I will be diplomatic
    for now and just tell you what I observed.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine pointed me
    to one of his typefaces, presumably because he admires it. I however couldn't
    admire it at all as there were simply too many problems, such as characters that
    are either too condensed or too wide, an S falling backwards and an Y of which
    the the join was way too low so it was noticeable that the Y was forced into V's
    metrics, where he just cut off the bottom part of V and attached a stem to it.
    All of this just told me he has a lot to learn still.\r\nHe had another 3 typefaces
    with similar problems, one illustrative typeface which was admittedly awesome
    and then there was a typeface which was still under revision but made during his
    type course (not at KABK though) and it features no problems at all. Now, you
    would obviously expect his teachers and classmates to give him the feedback to
    make his typeface perfect, but what surprised me is the clear difference in quality
    between his typefaces. The typeface he made during his course was perfect, while
    his other typefaces excluding the illustrative one are not up to the same standard.
    This shouldn't be the case. You ought to apply what you learned at school. So
    perhaps Hrant has a point here. The course seems way too short for some to actually
    become versed in type design, rather than be guided to one good product and not
    be able achieve the same quality again.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't apply to people like
    Nina, I think. I've over 4 years experience with type design now and I have a
    lot to learn still, but for me this short course would be ideal I think because
    I have the experience to fully grasp what I will learn there and I will be in
    the perfect environment to get feedback and learn and breathe type with like-minded
    people. Probably this environment will aid in polishing up your designs, which
    Hrant apparently has clear concerns about. I feel it's not a problem at all as
    long as you can apply what you learned during the course. What I observed on the
    aforementioned designer's portfolio does concern me a bit though, but as I said
    I have no worries of this happening to me.\r\n\r\nNina, I assumed you already
    had a degree in typography. It's a bit unfortunate you just graduated. I don't
    know you, but it would be fun to do a course with people I'm already familiar
    with on Typophile and whose work I admire. However, having seen the typefaces
    coming from the KABK course in recent years, I'm sure the appreciation part is
    going to manifest either way. What did you think of the course?"

  body: Great work shown by all the graduates.  As in many teaching situations, you
    have to now allow a time for the tea to steep.  It is not unusual for students
    to unintentionally emulate the work of their professors for a brief time. Let
    us leave them now to their own personal struggle with their own work to emerge
    as individual designers.  This is the most exciting time for them, the time to
    totally steer the ship without their trusted pilot looking over their shoulder.
    Give them a chance.

  body: "I agree with that sentiment. I'm greatly looking forward to it myself.\r\n\r\nBesides,
    I don't know how the hierarchy between type designers manifest in other countries,
    but I feel that in the Netherlands we have a long tradition of emulating the masters
    or working with their theories, for a while, anyway. For example, Gerrit Noordzij's
    theories are prevalent even if few directly follow his theories and emulate his
    style.\r\n\r\n\"The method of teaching type design at the Royal Academy is still
    largely based on Noordzij's theoretical model today, as several of his former
    students are now the professors at the department.\"\r\n\r\nSo it seems to some
    extent at least the sentiment Hrant is concerned about has always been prevalent,
    in the Netherlands and quite possibly in other countries as well, though I wouldn't
    really know. Now I think about it, I want to emerge myself into their world. I've
    dabbled with type myself for years now and I got some insight from one of Noordzij's
    students but he never became a type designer, unlike some of the other students.
    I want to know how to masters see and work with type and in fact I want to perpetuate
    some of their traditions and values which they learned from their masters. Certainly
    I will make their theories my own \u2014 like I have been doing \u2014 but it
    might even be essential to let them influence you and your work in that one year
    course.\r\n\r\nI don't usually care for traditions, but in this case I value being
    able to pass on their wisdom, or at least become very familiar with their philosophy,
    their work method, their knowledge and their style \u2014 if only to do the exact
    opposite."
