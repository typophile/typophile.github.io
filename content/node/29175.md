body: "Is it possible to style link fonts (PS & TT) for mac without having them all
  in the same suitcase in FLS5? OSX? Any way?\r\nMark Simonson pointed out that you
  could separate them out into suitcases in OS9 in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/17809\">this
  thread</a>, but what about for OSX? I thought i had read something on this on typophile
  very recently, but i can't seem to find it now. something about ffils and dataforks?
  i dunno... it's all mac to me. help please!"

  body: "This is a very good question. Some applications, such as InDesign, group
    fonts without traditional style linking. However, other applications such as MS
    Word still rely on style linking to chose the correct face. \r\n\r\nThe advantage
    of separate Suitcases is that they can be activated separately. It would be nice
    is separated fonts worked well in all applications as well. "

  body: When you pull fonts out of suitcase files or move them between suitcase files,
    the family information (the FOND resource) travels with them. So, yes, in the
    pre-OS X Mac Finder (or for that matter, the old Font/DA Mover), you never need
    to worry about fonts losing their style and family bindings when you move individual
    fonts around.

  body: so you just need an older OS to pull them apart? Is there no way to do it
    for OSX?

    with suitcase files. \r\n\r\nExtensis has a program for the Mac called <a href=\"http://www.extensis.com/en/products/font_management/product_information.jsp?id=1061\">FontDoctor</a>
    that (among other things) allows you to modify font suitcases."
