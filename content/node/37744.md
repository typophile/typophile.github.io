body: Well I don't know if this is the right board but I'll try anyways. Well I'm
  a second year  graphic design student and for one of our project we have to do a
  quote in the typeface give. I got palatino as my type and I was wondering if anyone
  knew of any or where I can find some either on the font its self or made by the
  creator of the type about it (Hermann zapf). I hope that makes sense.

    looking for information on [[Palatino]] and [[Hermann Zapf]]? Well, then the <a
    href=\"http://typophile.com/typowiki\">Wiki</a> is a good starting point. Search-engines
    like <a href=\"http://www.google.de/search?q=hermann%20zapf\">Google</a> can be
    quite helpful, too. Or <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/books\">libraries</a>. "

    on the pitch as a wing forward back in the day.\r\n\r\nHow about the quote here:\r\nhttp://meta.ath0.com/2006/04/page/2/\r\n\r\n\"Of
    course, doing what Apple had done and actually licensing the fonts wasn\u2019t
    an option. Bill Gates didn\u2019t get to be as rich as he is today by paying people
    for the use of their intellectual property... Microsoft saw a font they rather
    liked \u2014 Hermann Zapf\u2019s Palatino \u2014 so they called in Monotype to
    make a quick copy. The result was named Book Antiqua, and bundled with Office.\"\r\n"

    could use Palatino Linotype which ships with Windows - conveniently bypassed by
    iMatthew along with the fact that Arial was originally made for his employer IBM
