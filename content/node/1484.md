  body: Tiffany, <BR>The one that come to my mind is the branding I did for the 2002
    FIFA World Cup.  <BR>See <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/02/en/index.html"
    target="_blank">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/02/en/index.html</a> for the horizontal
    format and our website <a href="http://www.gospelbranding.com/experiences/fifa.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.gospelbranding.com/experiences/fifa.html</a> for the
    vertical format. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps. <BR> <BR>Ged

  body: Tiffany, <BR>This is where I labour in obscurity and with little apparent
    effect. Here presented in what the ID Manual says is most preferred to least preferred
    presentation. The idea is that where horizontal space is at a premium you stack
    it up. The Bodoni is hellish to deal with in web presentation no matter which
    layout is put to use. Also in example 2, the words &#39;Public Library&#39; appear
    larger than the word &#39;Vancouver&#39;. This is an optical illusion, in the
    artwork they are exactly the same size. I can&#39;t think of any where the logo
    or logotype is rotated 90 degrees which would be the other thing that occurs to
    me. Airlines for airplane livery? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/18092.gif"
