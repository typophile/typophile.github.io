    BORDER=0> Thank you, but if I&#39;m going to register I&#39;d become addicted
    to this place and my life is already short of any spare time. I&#39;m studying
    for, hopefully, the last exam of my life - I finished Medical School and now I
    must get a post as a rezident. This forum is great and I&#39;ll keep on visiting
    it as an &#34;Unregistered&#34; as often as I can.
