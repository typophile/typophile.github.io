  body: Quickly looking over this, I think the thing that bothers me most is that
    the date isn't aligned on a grid with the text next to it (the text encapsulating
    the date, if you will). I think making the whole a bit more aligned could make
    it look more airy and clean. Give the shapes some air, and you will also lend
    it a bit more legibility.

  - body: 'I agree with Sebastiaan - give your letters some air to float in.  Also;
      the tower is lost in the background, and more letter space may help it.  Did
      you try playing with the opacity of the yellow text to let the tower shine through?  This
      may (?) give the effect of the letters being made of the moonlight ... especially
      if you added a subtle yellow "spotlight graphic" (flashlight triangle) hitting
      the back of the text (from the moon).  Just a thought. '

  body: "I would recommend you use a less tonally similar (to the background) colour
    for the II. You could maybe put the date in the save the date banner. The choice
    of a serif for the BRAC Center\u2026 text seems strange I would look at the sans
    style with tighter leading, using half line spacing to keep the three elements
    (The BRAC Center\u2026 in Paris II, date and time, and ticket information) separate.
    btw, You need a space between \u2022Reserved Tables. \r\n\r\nTim"

    I have no literature to hand backing this up, but I\u2019m pretty sure it isn\u2019t
    a definitive universal standard. I\u2019m sure a grand reputable book somewhere
    holds the answer. Perhaps a new thread beckons.\r\n\r\n;^)"
