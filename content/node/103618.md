body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have around 2000 glyphs which needs to be renamed totally as most
  of them are more than 32 chars and truncated to 32 chars automatically by FontForge.
  This has created duplicate entries i think.\r\n\r\nWhat I need to do is give them
  a friendly name like GLYPH0001 - GLYPH2000.\r\n\r\nIs there any script which can
  do this. I will select the glyphs which i want to change and run the script in order
  todo so.\r\n\r\nPlease help.\r\n\r\nThanks & Regards\r\n\r\nNOTE: I am a newbie
  in fonts and fontforge."

    Does it really matter as long as you assign unicodes (from the private range.) "

  body: "<blockquote> I ran the scripts\r\n</blockquote>\r\nWhat I wrote  needs to
    be completed according to the way you use the code. I use such code in python
    scripts I call from bash shells. Above, Grzegorz wrote the script so as to call
    it from the GUI, using the \"Execute script\" window. Let me just add his lines
    to get a complete script to use that way:\r\n<pre>\r\n---\r\nfnt=fontforge.activeFont()\r\nfor
    g in fnt.selection.byGlyphs:\r\n  if g.unicode != -1:\r\n     g.glyphname= fontforge.nameFromUnicode(g.unicode)\r\n---\r\n</pre>\r\nYou
    first select the glyphs to rename and then, in the \"Execute script\" window with
    that script in it you click ok. That script renames according to the unicode value,
    not to the hex digits that follow the uniXXXX name; it does not look at the name
    at all.\r\n\r\nNow here is a script that looks at the uniXXXX name. It will  rename
    only glyphs with a name of the form uniXXXX and  it assumes glyph names that start
    with uni are followed by a valid hex number, nothing else;  it does not check
    that what follows uni is a valid hex number. \r\n<pre>\r\n---\r\nimport string\r\nfnt=fontforge.activeFont()\r\nfor
    g in fnt.selection.byGlyphs:\r\n  name=g.glyphname\r\n  if string.find(name,'uni')
    == 0:\r\n    g.glyphname=fontforge.nameFromUnicode(int(name[3:],16))\r\n---\r\n</pre>\r\nAgain,
    you select the glyphs to rename, and click ok in the \"Execute script\" window.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you have many scripts, it is not handy to copy them all the time in the \"Execute
    script\" window. What you can do is save them in some file, say <code>unicode2name.py</code>
    and <code>uniname2name.py</code>. You then click \"File &gt; Preferences &gt;
    Script menu\" and give a name for the menu name, say \"Unicode to name\"; then
    you click on the three dots, go to the folder containing the script, put \"*.py\"
    in the the line just above \"Filter\" and click \"Filter\"; you will see the files
    .py appear. You select the one you want to associate to the given menu name.\r\n\r\nAfter,
    you can execute the script on the selected glyphs by clicking on \"File > Script
    Menu\" and the appropriate name associated to the script. You can also execute
    with some key combination (it is control alt digit on my mac).\r\n\r\nA script
    that checks that the hex values are valid and that handles alternates (.sc, .alt,
    .ss02 etc) and also glyph names separated by an underscore requires splitting
    the glyph name and handling piecewise. Here is one that checks that the hex is
    valid and that can handle names of the form uniXXXXX.sc.ss02 i.e. alternames of
    uniXX...X\r\n<pre>\r\n---\r\nimport string\r\nff=fontforge\r\nfnt=ff.activeFont()\r\n\r\ndef
    ishex(h):\r\n  return all(c in string.hexdigits for c in h)\r\n\r\ndef gname(altname):\r\n
    \ l = string.split(altname,'.')\r\n  name=l[0]\r\n  if string.find(name,'uni')
    == 0:\r\n    hexd=name[3:]\r\n    if ishex(hexd):\r\n      l[0]= ff.nameFromUnicode(int(hexd,16))\r\n
    \     return '.'.join(l)\r\n  return altname\r\n \r\nfor g in fnt.selection.byGlyphs:\r\n
    \ g.glyphname=gname(g.glyphname)\r\n---\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "btw, Michael\r\n<blockquote>\r\n[...] When you have many scripts, it is not

    can define own scripts in 'Tools' menu. For example first script:\r\n<pre>\r\nimport
    fontforge;\r\n\r\ndef rename_unival(arg1,font):\r\n  for g in font.selection.byGlyphs:\r\n
    \   if g.unicode != -1:\r\n      g.glyphname= fontforge.nameFromUnicode(g.unicode);\r\n\r\ndef

    to unicode value\"); \r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSave them in change2uni.py in  .Fontforge/python/
    directory, and now You have new menu item   'Rename to unicode value' in a submenu
    'Glyph_names' of the 'Tools' menu (of the Font window).\r\n"

  body: That's certainly better looking than in the File menu but the documentation
    says there is then no shortcut. Those in "File &gt; Script Menu" have a shortcut.
    Unless you have lots of them, I don't see the advantage but, since I use scripts
    almost exclusively from the command line, maybe I am missing something expert
    GUI users appreciate.
