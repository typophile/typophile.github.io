    <BR> <BR>Now that&#39;s a really great idea! &#40;Maybe add a way to control the
    size of the circle.&#41; <BR> <BR>I think Typophile should adopt/publicize this
    mechanism across the board. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Jens, <BR> <BR>The Flash-feedback machine is excellent. <BR>Overall, the
    font reminds me of a cross between  <BR>Scala Sans and Gill Sans. I&#39;m not
    sure yet if  <BR>that&#39;s a good thing. <BR> <BR>Stephen '

  body: ' Sorry Stephen, I disagree. I think it &#42;is&#42; a good thing. But, I
    see more Nobel in it than Gill.  <BR> <BR>At first, the upper bowl on the lc &#39;g&#39;
    seemed <BR>squashed, but after reading through the paragraph <BR>it doesn&#39;t
    seem too squashed, only just a bit. And from the preview, the down-stroke on both
    the lc &#39;t&#39; and the lc &#39;a&#39; seem a bit heavy. Also, the join between
    the stroke and the arm on the lc &#39;r&#39; is too heavy? All questions. Not
    facts. <BR> <BR>I love it in general and the figs are v. nice. Other weights? '

  body: ' for the Flash-feedback: okay, okay I will make a little tutorial and some
    improvements &#40;i.e. controling the zoom for Details&#41; And what Hrant sad
    resizing the circle &#40;hope i really can do this...&#41; <BR> <BR>to Stephen:
    Yes i could be there is the a little bit Gill in my font, but that wasnt my inspiration.
    The types get a very classic stile. But there is greater &#34;wechselzug&#34;
    than in Gill. &#40;dont found the right english word&#41; <BR> <BR>to Tiffany:
    I will check it. The Problem is that a view on screen dont show all details and
    problems. Maybe that is the problem. But I dont really know.  Recently I tryed
    to make the lc &#39;g&#39; smaller but i think this version is better.   <BR>the
    down-strok of the a is stil very small. The a need a smaller downstroke &#40;I
    learned it in this way...&#41;! But there are many problems with the down-stroke
    width &#40;you will see it at least on paper&#41;. <BR>Im recently start to draw
    and digitize a italic version. But first i need to improve the numbers and developing
    the special sign, improving punctuation, accents or emphasize?  <BR> <BR>so long
