  font is interesting with its stylistic implementation through asymmetrical serif.
  Such design is characteristic for the Ukrainian style. The drawing of the font is
  based on the sketches of a famous Ukrainian graphic artist of early 20th century
  Heorhiy Narbut. His work set the whole school in the Ukrainian graphic art and is
  still very influential nowadays. The font is capital and also includes a set of
  ornaments in addition the standard set of symbols.\r\n\r\nBuy on [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/2d-typo/kalyna/|MyFonts]]
