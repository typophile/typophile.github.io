The name looks like it could be a night club, plus you gave no explaination of the type of restaurant it is. Is it McDonalds or Le Cirque, is it French or Asian. The logo means nothing without brand idenity. So make it painfully clear its about food and the kind of place it is.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'll also agree with Daniel; to me, a restaurant's identity is one location where the average customer should not notice flashy design or excellent typography. Of course the identity package you create must match the style and intended use of the restaurant, but 'overdesigning' risks appearing contrived.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Roh. I read your critique.My reply- The Lux work is supposed to look minimalist (or generic as you described it). Lux is located between upscale independent clothing stores and restaurants. It is not supposed to look expensive (nor inexpensive). The prices are a bit higher than most cafes ( as well as quality), but it was not owners desire to specifically express the aspect. This is Seattle and most people do not care if it costs a bit more. People wanting Starbucks or Tullys can walk a block in any direction and find either (again this is Seattle). Lux is different from both of these large Espresso mega chains. Lux venue is sometimes host to a variety of events from Dj music nights, poetry, art openings, etc. But none of these events are on regular schedules, nor part of Lux's core business.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The identity has served the client well for the last few years. Besides, it's businesscard (which features logo) was recently published in a graphic design book &quot; Best of Businesscards 6&quot; from Rockport Publishing, so I guess at least some industry folks find it is attractive and functional sincve it was picked over 1000's of other entries.  Their older logo is shown below. At the time this logo was used, furniture was mostly handmade wrought iron, and place had more of a casual &quot;artsy&quot; feeling. This was partially changed because people would hang out all day and buy less. New identity and interior changes improved sales and brought profits up to help owner sell business which was her desire with the changes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

Even at the student level. Granted, a lot of this depends on the quality of the particular professor. When I was in school, I was fortunate enough to have professors that spent as much time teaching us the art of critique as they did teaching us the art of design&hellip;not to mention the art of presenting our own work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A lot of the restaurant logo posts in here have been 'this is a logo I made for a restaurant. What do you think?' which is WAY to vague to be of any use to anyone giving a critique. As such, it seemes as if critiques were not being done in-class. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Again&hellip;this in no way is meant as a critique of these students&hellip;I just found it a bit odd that it was happening.</div>
