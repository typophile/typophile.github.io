  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">That is, how to specifically to learn about typography, typographic design (of documents, web sites, books, magazines).

I know that the question is a broad one and that one of the answers would be: to get a degree in graphic design or something similar. I have a fair share of degrees and at the moment that really wouldn't be feasible.

So I'm looking for advice from both professional designers (those who have a degree in the filed and those who don't but are professionally active in the field) and people for whom this is a hobby or something not really done on professional level.

I guess it would include books, suggestions of beautifully designed logos, books, documents, websites... and basically ANYTHING you'd have to say on topic. Things from basic properties of typefaces (x-height, whether it's a 'modern font', kerning) to paragraph design, line spacing, page margins, how to choose the font based on material... to anything and everything 'advanced' and 'expert'.

If you attended a school or a course in this type of design, I'd like to know how it helped you and what would you say are some valuable things you've learned while there.

Thank you.</div>

Questions like "how to choose the font based on material" aren't answered (effectively) in any book. That comes from experience, and a general/overall education in design. Reading books on your own will not make you a better designer. You may learn some of the rights & wrongs, but that's easy. Immersing yourself in a world of design where you go to class and critique and see other's work and have a chance to critique that and you're forced to do projects and certain subjects/categories of design etc. is something you can't (easily) do on your own.

Bringhurst's "The Elements of Typographic Style" is a good place to start, in terms of typography. Muller-Brockmann's "Grid Systems in Graphic Design." Samara's "Making and Breaking the Grid: A Graphic Design Layout Workshop." Meggs's "A History of Graphic Design." Just a couple good ones.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not sure if you're thinking of becoming a professional designer, or just want to learn more. If you're thinking professional, keep in mind that graphic design is communication problem-solving, and typography is just one element in that process. There's much more to learn, including design theory, design history, color theory, photography, illustration, printing, business practices, all the various computer programs you need to learn, and on and on. 

I'm not trying to discourage you, and typography is indeed very important, but typography is just one of many things that designers need to learn. </div>

As JamesM says, "graphic design" has become such a widely reaching profession, it's difficult to just jump in. Web design (html php css javascript actionscript sql asp), packaging (and all the things that entails...), printing technologies (litho, digital, offset, digital offset, etc.), photography, all the things he mentioned. Mastery of these things are what make a good designer, and they're things best learned in a school environment (in my opinion.)</div>
