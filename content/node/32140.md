body: Learning InDesign.  We are supposed to pick a font to study.  I narrowed it
  down to 3 Caslon, Baskerville, Bodoni.  I was looking at Gordy because I wanted
  a 1930s type and earlier Jenson and Rockwell.  What's a good one that's used but
  not heavily used?

    Because it's not a class in Illustrator or Quark.  I'm sure the instructor assigns
    the same project in the other software classes. I wanted a font that wasn't heavily
    used and looked nice."

    the choice is part of the assignment, what caused you to narrow down to those
    three? Heavily used is a nebulous term, but of those three I would guess that
    Caslon is the least used.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Fine reply Alessandro.\r\n\r\nBob what level are you studying at? This assignment
    is the same as one set for my (pre-graduate) certificate students from about 2
    years back; we changed the assignment because making posters in InDesign doesn't
    necessarily allow for people to learn about multipage document layout.\r\n\r\nAs
    I recall, the subject matter for the poster <em>is</em> the typeface; so if I
    was the instructor, I'd be expecting to see the name of the typeface, its (approximate)
    date of release/manufacture, the full name and biographical dates of the type
    designer, a complete character set and a brief paragraph explaining the types
    place in history. Easy.\r\n\r\nOut of the six typefaces Bob mentions, I'd say
    they're all pretty heavily used, but either good or beautiful in their own way...
    my own experience suggests that of the six, Rockwell might be the least widely
    used. (Advertisement!) having said that, I think there is more available information
    on the <a href=\"http://www.100types.com/100types.com.12caslon.html\">Caslon</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.100types.com/100types.com.24bodoni.html\">Bodoni</a> and
    <a href=\"http://www.100types.com/100types.com.29baskerville.html\">Baskerville</a>."

  body: Thank you.  I have the subject matter down.  I just wanted to pick a typeface
    that was interesting to me and commercial enough not to drive off the hordes.  Just
    by making a list (there were more than six) and whittling it down made the project
    a success for me.  Thanks again and don't worry I won't pick <a href="http://typographi.com/001071.php">Helvetica</a>
    or Gil Sans.
