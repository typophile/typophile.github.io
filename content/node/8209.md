body: Hi everyone! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m so used to OS9 with ATM deluxe - but I&#39;ve
  purchased a Powerbook with OSX &#40;which contains Fontbook.&#41; I&#39;m getting
  so stressed out about it, lots of work to do but I&#39;m extremely limited on the
  fonts I can use at present. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m running Quark 4 &#40;soon to receive
  6 for Xmas!&#41; and have fonts from my OS9 system. <BR>The fonts I have are mainly
  Postscript, of which they won&#39;t work with fontbook, or OSX as a whole. I can
  install them but that&#39;s as far as it gets - they don&#39;t appear within Quark.
  <BR>Some others do but they appear corrupted! <BR> <BR>I know that OSX will use
  TTF fonts, so I can use my Windows ones on there, but I only have limited amount
  of TTF fonts from my Windows PC. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t want to start breaking license
  agreements, but can I not use a font convertor program to change the Postcripts
  into TTF? If so, where can I get it. I&#39;ve tried a few freebie programs but they
  aren&#39;t effective, or just difficult to work out.  <BR> <BR>Will postscripts
  not work with OSX at all? or am I being a little retarded?  <BR>I admit I&#39;m
  not the biggest font expert in the world - which you can see clearly! <BR> <BR>Look
  forward to any help you can offer! Thanks in advance guys &#40;and gals!&#41; And
  my apologies if you&#39;ve had post like this before.

  body: 'FontBook can be handy, but it&#39;s useless if you want to use fonts in Classic
    applications.  <BR> <BR>Only fonts which are placed in the Fonts folder of the
    OS9 System Folder will be active in Classic applications. FontBook only puts fonts
    in the usual OSX font locations, the upshot of which is that they are only available
    to OSX applications. <BR> <BR>So: The fonts you want to use in Classic applications
    should be placed in System Folder:Fonts: . &#40;Note: Fonts placed there will
    be available to all applications, including OSX ones.&#41; <BR> <BR>As for PostScript
    fonts, you need to make sure you include both the Font Suitcase and the PostScript
    Type 1 font file, just like in the old days. ATM is still needed for Classic applications
    just as with OS9 and earlier, but not for OSX applications as PS Type 1 support
    is built into OSX. <BR> <BR>If you want to know more, I would recommend downloading
    Apple&#39;s guide to font management in OSX which can be found here: <BR> <BR><a
    href="http://www.apple.com/pro/archive/creative/fonts/" target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/pro/archive/creative/fonts/</a>
    <BR> <BR>A word of advice: If you can avoid using Classic applications, font management
    in OSX will be much simpler.'

  body: Thanks Mark! <BR> <BR>Clears that up for me! Think I&#39;ll put in ATM for
    Classic - that is until I get my hands on Quark 6. Things could become simpler
    then! <BR> <BR>&#40;Apologies for the repetitive posting - not sure why that&#39;s
    happened... I only posted it once.&#41;

  body: <i>&#62; repetitive posting - not sure why that&#39;s happened</i> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    a bug in the script they use here for posting messages. If you post a message
    and it seems like it&#39;s not going through, 99 times out of 100 it has. Each
    time you cancel and attempt to post again, another copy of your message will be
    posted. <BR> <BR>As near as I can tell, the bug happens when the script tries
    to display the page you posted to and it gets hung up. The part of the script
    that posts the message works fine nearly all of the time.
