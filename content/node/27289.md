  <a href="http://typophile.com/node/20870">is right around the corner.</a></strong>
  I'm busy helping with last minute preparation and found myself in need of a script
  to put cropmarks around oodles of images. I'm too lazy to draw them, didn't really
  have time to do it, so I started to look. But, then I remembered that Miguel (Sousa)
  had pointed us toward <a href="http://rj-graffix.com/software/scripts.html">some
  very handy scripts</a> on another thread here at Typophile. I probably saved myself
  about 4 hours in using this script. :^) All I had to do was drag the folder of images
  from the desktop directly into InDesign (all import at 100% with the frames fitting
  the content), move the pictures around on the page to maximize the print area, select
  all the images on the spread, double-click on the script, select how I want them,
  click apply. Magic!!!
