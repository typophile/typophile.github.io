body: "Hello Typophile community!\r\n\r\nAlthough I've been a visitor to Typophile
  for a while now, this is my first actual post here. I was hoping someone could help
  identify the typefaces used in this gig poster:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a-seaside-rendezvous_4413.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  pretty certain that the word 'MUSE' is in Futura, or a similar geometric sans. However,
  I can't figure out the rest of the type on the poster. It looks to me like the words
  'A SEASIDE RENDEZVOUS' are in some kind of Western/Circus style font? I've tried
  using 'What The Font' and 'Identifont', but neither of them brought up successful
  results.\r\n\r\nI've singled out what I considered to be some of the more distinctive
  letters in the hope that this will make them a bit easier to identify:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type-sample_5735.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  originally thought that the rest of the info on the poster was all in the same typeface
  as 'A SEASIDE RENDEZVOUS', but looking at it closely I think that the rest of the
  information, such as the dates and the location, and the words 'MUSIC' and 'LIGHTS',
  are actually in a third typeface. The serifs on '2009' seem different, and the 'M'
  clearly has a contrast between thick and thin lines which isn't present in the typeface
  for 'A SEASIDE RENDEZVOUS'. I know the type on the jpg is all quite small and may
  be hard to identify, but I think the best chance is with the unusual descender on
  the uppercase 'G', found at the bottom of the poster. I can't think of any typefaces
  where I've seen a 'G' like that before, so hopefully it will be the key to solving
  the problem.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows what either of the typefaces are, or any similar
  ones, it would be hugely appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nMatthew Young\r\n<a

    have been Red Rooster faces [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/yeoman-gothic-rr/|Yeoman
    Gothic]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/commander-rr/|Commander]],
    but both do not have the right R structure. I also searched Dafont, since the
    other font had been a freebie, but I found no similar serif there.\r\n\r\n\r\n

    and Commander are both good alternatives if I can't find out what the proper font
    is for the header.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else knows what the 'SEASIDE RENDEZVOUS' type
    is, it'd still be hugely appreciated."
