body: I posted the following question as an aside to another thread. But now I want
  to bring it to the fore and see if I can get an accurate explanation - <BR> <BR><i>I&#39;ve
  been bouncing the word gothic around in my mind lately and have never been able
  to reconcile &#39;gothic&#39; fonts with what my idea of gothic should be. I always
  want to say gothic when I&#39;m thinking of fonts that look goth-ish&#40;?&#41;.
  Why is that?</i> <BR> <BR>Why is it that whenver I hear the word Gothic in relation
  to fonts I think of something that&#39;s more like a Tuscan? <BR> <BR>Anyone?

  body: In the early 19th century, what we now call sans-serif typefaces were introduced.  They
    were considered by some to be crude and ugly, compared to traditional serif faces,
    and so were labeled &#34;gothic.&#34;  This meaning of gothic is no longer current,
    of course, but it survives &#40;if memories from my college art history class
    are correct&#41; in the term &#34;gothic architecture&#34;--so called by people
    in the Renaissance who disliked the older style.  Neither has anything in particular
    to do with the Goths, except that they were considered barbaric by the &#34;civilized&#34;
    Romans whose empire they invaded.

  body: Actually, I was under the impression that &#34;Grotesk&#34; was the label
    given to the first sans-serif typefaces, the category that includes faces like
    Akzidenz Grotesk and Helvetica. Grotesks were basically just Egyptian faces with
    the serifs lobbed off, and people thought this looked odd &#40;grotesque&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Gothic faces, on the other hand, derive their appelation from Gothic
    hand script, which first developed in German &#40;Gothic&#41; Europe. Gothic script
    diverged from other rounded letterforms, making the sides of all letters &#40;even
    round letters&#41; straight. Modern Gothic sans serif fonts keep much of the structure
    of the Gothic hand script, including straight-sided letters. DIN is a good example
    of a Gothic sans.  <BR> <BR>Because many sans are Gothic, the term has sometimes
    been misunderstood to designate all sans typefaces, but this is incorrect. <BR>
    <BR>This is how I understand it.  I could be wrong. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: Paul, <BR> <BR>Do you have an example of the &#39;DIN&#39; font that you are
    referring to? <BR> <BR>So, all sans are grotesk, but not all sans are gothic?
    Could you compare some different sans to give me an idea of what you mean? <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Rather, the first sans were grotesk, but now it&#39;s just one category
    of sans. There are grotesks, gothics, humanists, geometrics, and other categorizations
    of sans. <BR> <BR>Some grotesks: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/11110.png"

  body: 'I think the &#34;gothic&#34; tag was also commonly given in the U.S. to what
    were called &#34;grotesk,&#34; &#34;grotesque,&#34; or &#34;antique&#34; in Europe.
    Hence: Franklin Gothic, News Gothic, Trade Gothic, Tourist Gothic, Avant Garde
    Gothic, etc. Not sure why this was, though.'

  body: Mark, I&#39;ve been told that many American type designers misunderstood what
    &#34;gothic&#34; meant, and thought it referred to all sans; hence all those gothic
    sans that aren&#39;t actually gothic. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: '&#39;Gothic&#39; was used as early as 1863 by the Miller &amp; Richard foundry
    &#40;British&#41; to describe sanserif types. Why the American founders adopted
    &#39;gothic&#39; over the more dominant &#39;grotesque&#39; is not too clear.

  body: 'Synopsis: <BR> <BR>The word &#39;Gothic&#39; in typographic terms has evolved
    to have a different meaning from architectural terms. &#40;This is what led to
    my initial confusion.&#41; <BR> <BR>Furthermore, the statement &#39;gothic typeface
    = sans-serif typeface&#39; is not accurate. Gothic is one type of sans - sans
    that are more architectonic in form and have a more vertical thrust&#40;more condensed
    feel&#41; than grotesk. The word gothic fell to these letterforms because they
    had their origin in Gothic &#40;German&#41; Europe. <BR> <BR>Is that about right?
    Thanks. <BR>Tom'
