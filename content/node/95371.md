    also like to know why you seem so eager to see 2012 Headline discredited. Is it
    because you admire Brody, or something else?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I\u2019m just being Frank.  \r\n\r\nFrankly the typeface isn\u2019t as nicely
    stylized as Brody\u2019s, but reminiscent of work he was doing thirty years ago.
    The 2012 London Olympic typeface is functional, and might look great for labeling
    an electrical box, but I find its use for the Olympics questionable. I\u2019m
    not familiar with British culture, but wondering if the type design for this monumental
    occasion is an accurate representation of what Great Britain is all about \u2014
    regimented, stiff and overly restrained. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t find it to be a
    bad typeface design, but a bad choice for the Olympics. Perhaps your article will
    discuss the context of this particular type design.\r\n\r\n\u2014 F.U. Finkelstein"

  body: "Frank, I suspect you\u2019re using \u201CBrody\u201D as generic shorthand
    to reference the formal experimentation of twenty odd years ago.\r\nI don\u2019t
    recall anything like Gareth Hague\u2019s 2012 face from back then, certainly not
    by Neville Brody.\r\nSure there were some exotic boxy fonts by Kisman, Licko,
    di Sciullo, eboy, &c., but nothing based on the concept of rotated slant.\r\nThe
    way that Hague has used rotation to give formal structure to a typeface complementing
    the wayward angularity of the Olympic logo is a brilliant concept."

  body: "Is the rotation more than a simple twist to hundreds of years of italic design?
    Is it really brilliant? It\u2019s a nice twist, but just a twist, not a leap.
    Looking forward to Hrant\u2019s enlightenment on this font. \r\n\r\nAnd I\u2019m
    not using \u201CBrody\u201D as shorthand for anything other than Neville Brody\u2019s
    heavily geometric work in the early 1980s, not necessarily boxy, but the same
    solid, even stroke with the same stroke proportion. To me the roots of both the
    logo design and typeface go back to Brody\u2019s new wave work back then, but
    lacking a new millennium sense of global appeal. \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned before,
    the type has plenty of functional qualities, but is in no way a monumental type
    design. I don\u2019t see it in future text books as a Helvetica, but maybe a Hobo.

    logo, yes.\r\nI say that from the perspective of wondering what I would have done
    had I been tasked with designing a typeface to go with the logo.\r\nI don\u2019t
    think contemplating any of Neville Brody\u2019s type designs would have pointed
    in the direction of Hague\u2019s solution.\r\n\r\nIn general, the bit of history
    that concerns \u201Crotated italics\u201D does not lead directly to the 2012 face.\r\nHere
    is some recent discussion:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/74092\r\nhttp://commercialtype.com/typefaces/platform\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I caught a glimpse of Kobe Bryant in the crowd, wearing a shirt with a monogram
    that looked like his name mimicking the Olympic logo. Was that real or just my
    imagination?"

    do have compassion for Gareth Hague for not only having to harmonize with that
    discordant logo, but also surely being stuck in a dreadful design committee of
    the same group responsible for it. I think he perhaps did well considering that,
    but greatness is what was called for on this monumental, global occasion. I don\u2019t
    see greatness.\r\n\r\nThe Brody connection is there for me more than other influences.
    \r\n\r\nHistory will show the final verdict on this typeface. We will see.\r\n\r\n<em>>Could
    you please leave Neville Brody out of the Olympics.</em>\r\n\r\nYeah. Sure. Whatever."

  body: Honestly since it seems literally everybody in the world hates it, I think
    it will become one of the most famous fonts ever, right up there with Helvetica
    and Times.  Does anybody know what the EULA is on this?  I thought I read he was
    giving it away to the world for free.
