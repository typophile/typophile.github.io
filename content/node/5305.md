body: This is a delightful serif font, the &#34;G&#34; especially has a very nice
  bottom curve, where the vertical part doesn&#39;t rest on the bottom line.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/38866.jpg"

  body: Is this the Comic Sans effect? The world can only manage one &#34;most hated
    font&#34; at a time, so Souvenir having been displaced by Vincent&#39;s little
    baby, a full-scale rehabilitation is inevitable? <BR> <BR>&#40;How long will it
    be before Comic Sans shows up here? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I&#39;m not surprised to see fonts like Souvenir showing up in design today,
    nor am I surprised to find it here. Souvenir&#39;s increased use reflects a break
    from the ubiquitous technology inspired design that so proliferated during the
    last five or seven years. I find the homeliness of Souvenir slightly charming
    when compared against the sea of techno-industrial Lineto, Test Pilot Collective,
    and T26 fonts. <BR> <BR>Had I lived through the 70s, I imagine I might feel differently
    about the issue. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I think Souvenir was a well-designed font with a strong flavor. But it got
    so popular for a while that designers just got tired of looking at it. Now that
    you don&#39;t see it so much anymore, I can see it making a comeback, but it will
    probably never be as big as it once was &#40;at least as long as boomers are around&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s funny that you mention &#34;technology inspired design.&#34;
    Souvenir, which was originally released as a foundry face in the 1920s but never
    caught on, was revived in the 1970s because it held up well on phototypesetting
    equipment, which tended to soften corners and such.

  body: After being so familiar with Souvenir for so many years, I was surprised to
    hear about Souvenir Gothic, which was forced on me by a client &#40;I will forever
    be sorry I showed her MyFonts&#41;. Though Souvenir Gothic -- not designed by
    Benton/Benguiat, by the way -- has the debatable advantage of not currently being
    in use by anyone else &#40;as far as I know&#41;, I think I would have preferred
    plain old Souvenir. <BR> <BR>And hey, if Souvenir is making a comeback, can we
    make some room also for Serif Gothic? That was my favorite as a 12-year-old, so
    it still has a special place in my heart.
