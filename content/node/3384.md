  body: It may just be your graphic here, but it looks like the italic is wobbling
    back and forth as it goes, like all the vertical strokes are misaligned. I&#39;m
    no expert, but that&#39;s distracting to me.

  body: Your ascenders are more sloped than your descenders, except the lc f, whose
    tail&#39;s also rather weak to my eye. I rather like the effect that the other
    letters have, but the f sticks out.

    angel and i tryed to vary it in one character. Currently I like but maybe it goes
    to far. <BR> <BR>lc &#39;f&#39;: Thank you Sheryas, it realy doesent fit. Have

  body: I especially like the lc l, incidentally. That character is simply beautiful,
    and it shows off your variable slant angle &#40;if I understand correctly, you&#39;re
    making a &#42;curve&#42; rather than a straight angled slope?&#41; really well.
