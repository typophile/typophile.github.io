  theme of an antique map of the stars. I am a little stuck on the typeface. Here
  is a map I am using for reference. I love these typefaces, but I'm not sure what
  they are. If anyone has any suggestions, that would be wonderful! Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/starmap_5195.jpg]"

    they were hand-drawn."

    style is exactly what inspired Bodoni, Didot and Walbaum to cast metal type resembling
    this ductus of letters.\r\n\r\nWould you mind to tell us the date and place of
    publication of this wonderful map?"

    quite as eccentric as Sirenne, but definitely has that hand-inked look."
