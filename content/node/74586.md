body: "Hi,\r\n\r\ni'm having a school project on catalog design and i'm making a body
  shop catalog. I'm stuck at the logo typeface though. \r\nI've found some topic in
  this forum in which people asking the same question, but the answer was always 'maybe
  Gill sans'. But i tried to match both typefaces but it's slightly different. I've
  tried different sans serif typefaces, but none of them matched.\r\nSo i'm hoping
  someone can identify the font here....\r\nthank you :)"
