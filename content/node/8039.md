body: Hello, <BR> <BR>I am trying to convert this typeface &#34;Lumpy&#34; into a
  monospaced font. The font is a handwritten/script face. Is there an easy way to
  do this using Macromedia Fontographer? To give give all the letters and numbers
  equal spacing on both left/right side of the font between all characters? <BR> <BR>Lucas

  body: 'A monospaced script?! <BR>Wow, that&#39;s actually quite an interesting idea!
    In fact the joins might alleviate the major design issue with mono fonts: spacing!
    <BR> <BR>&#34;Easy&#34; though? Sorry, quite the opposite.  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp'

    <BR>I basically want and cant control the tracking of the font in Adobe Acrobat
    so I want to add wider tracking to each letter. So it appears as though they are
    equally spaced out. <BR> <BR>Lucas

  body: In FontLab 4.6, to add spacing between letters, you would need to select Tools
    / Transform, check Apply to whole font and choose Metrics / Adjust Metrics.  <BR>To
    set the width of all glyphs to the same amount, in the Transform window you would
    need to choose Metrics / Set width.  <BR>I have no idea how to do this in 8 years
    old applications.  <BR>Adam

  body: Has anyone used Adobe Acrobat to create dynamic fields on a pdf? For some
    reason the font I&#39;m using does not look the same as in Acrobat as it does
    in other Adobe apps, like Photoshop and Illustrator. I&#39;ve changed the font
    to have a greater kerning distance for each letter... so its more spaced out,
    but for some reason Adobe Acrobat does not recognize this change. Any ideas? <BR>

  body: Might not be related or helpful, but you might need to set the new font you&#39;ve
    created to &#39;editable&#39; embedding for it to work in Acrobat forms, if this
    the same thing?
