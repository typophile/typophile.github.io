body: "I am thinking about fonts to use in the graphics for a contemporary art institution,
  and I would really appreciate some advice.\r\n\r\nIt's a big old beautiful Victorian
  building, a public institution in the centre of a city, and the programme ranges
  from younger artists to mid-career figures. The graphic vehicles include logo, posters,
  leaflets etc. The design has to communicate authority - even scholarship - but with
  a contemporary / funky edge. (Think: dandified librarian).\r\n\r\nI like the idea
  of using Dave Farey's Caslon Black as the main display font, EG for the logo of
  the institution. But could anyone recommend a less funky serif font that would go
  with it? Perhaps with regular and semi-bold weights, for body copy and titles?\r\n\r\nOr
  does anyone have other suggestions for a combination of serif fonts: a display fonts
  for the logo; and another font for the rest?\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

    why not use a face more in keeping with the era and style of the building?"

    art, esp \"contemporary\" art. With both, just about any weight you need is available.
    But then, I only do books, so that may not be responsive.\r\n\r\nFWIW & probably
    not much."

  body: "These are very useful comments - thank you all.\r\n\r\nFrode, the usual way
    to approach design for contemporary art institutions is indeed to use fonts that
    feel 'contemporary'. Commonly this means using sans serif faces throughout - and
    I'm keen to avoid that tactic. However, there are obviously more subtle ways of
    being contemporary - and I will look at the fonts that you are suggesting.\r\n\r\nNick,
    I have thought hard today about this question of the relation to the period of
    the building - I agree it's an important issue. I have ditched Caslon Black. And
    my latest thought is to use fonts that are a bit earlier in origin: a slightly
    chunky Modern font for the logo, such as Berthold Bodoni Antiqua; and then a version
    of Baskerville for the titles and body copy.\r\n\r\n(Frode, you are of course
    right that the logotype should be treated separately, and perhaps shouldn't be
    set in a generic font. But at the moment the exercise I am doing is a notional
    one.)"

  body: "Well yes, there is a Shinntype font for (almost) every occasion :-)\r\nBut
    as I have no idea what the building looks like (there were many genres of architecture
    in the 19th century), it would be premature to suggest a ModSuite font.\r\n\r\nThe
    thing to bear in mind is that the logo for an institution will probably end up
    in signage, with the potential for disaster:\r\n\r\nhttp://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007/01/very-english-blunder.html"
