    wedding program (she's marrying a wonderful man from Chile).  I purchased the
    font, but haven't received it -- there's nowhere to download it and I've gotten
    no emails.  I'll give it a few more hours before panicking and resorting to a
    different typeface, but does anyone have any advice about how purchasing fonts
    works on the site?\r\n\r\nThanks!  Gracias!  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey, hrant -- alas no phone number.  But while I've got you live on the internets:
    do you know how purchase on latinotype,com typically works?  I pressed \"comprar\",
    paid paypal, and then had to re-enter the url to go back to the site (no forwarding
    or button to return), and no sign of download.  I'm assuming I get an email with
    attachment, but it's been a few hours since I paid.  \r\n\r\nAnyhoo, any info
    would help!  I can always use a non-Chilean face, since no one but me will probably
    care.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-\"Aunt\" beth"
