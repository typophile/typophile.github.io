I did see an old thread from '02 stating that both the ampersand and the "y" are used, for differing reasons having to do with taste and preference.

But what I am really wondering is whether there exists some hybrid of the y/et y/& that could speak bilingually. A Spanish/English ampersand.

I have never seen it, though I don't read in Spanish. Chances are it does, but if it does not exist, please, someone with more talent than myself--I'd love to see it. It would be a good exercise in the spirit of collaboration between cultures.

Thanks to his own words, we know that Obama can be trusted to put ideology ahead of commonsense economic goals to put people back to work.<a href="http://www.wellensteynjackenstore.com/"><strong>Wellensteyn Outlet</strong></a> In an interview with the editorial board of the Des Moines Register, Obama was asked if he regretted his push to enact health-care overhaul legislation when he had huge Democratic majorities in Congress instead of emphasizing measures to fix the economy. &quot;Absolutely not,&quot; responded the president. <a href="http://www.wellensteynjackenstore.com/"><strong>Wellensteyn Schneezauber</strong></a> Obama's remark to the Register editorial board — which later endorsed Romney, the first time the paper has backed a GOP nominee in four decades — shouldn't have come as a surprise. During the 2008 campaign,<a href="http://www.wellensteynjackenstore.com/"><strong>Wellensteyn Store</strong></a> he didn't shrink from proclaiming an ideological goal even when the facts argued against it. During a debate, Obama said he advocated increasing the capital gains tax even when told lower rates produce more revenues by encouraging investments in the economy. Obama said higher taxes were a matter of fairness. Obama wanted the pie split up fairly even if his policy meant a smaller pie.<a href="http://www.wellensteynjackenstore.com/wellensteyn-jacken-herren-c-1.html"><strong>Wellensteyn Jacken Herren</strong></a> A smaller pie is exactly what the American family has ended up with after four years of his policies. Household income has fallen, and most of that came during the Obama recovery, the weakest in modern history. Economic growth,<a href="http://www.wellensteynjackenstore.com/wellensteyn-jacken-damen-c-2.html"><strong>Wellensteyn Jacken Damen</strong></a> as measured by Gross Domestic Product, has slowed and some experts worry the recovery may be stalling and headed back toward recession in 2013. So the issue of trust is a simple one. <a href="http://www.wellensteynjackenstore.com/wellensteyn-jacken-weste-c-3.html"><strong>Wellensteyn Weste</strong></a> The record shows Obama can be trusted to deliver more of the same ideological agenda that has kept too many people out of work and eroded the American dream.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It could be an amusing exercise. But "y", in Spanish, simply means "and". So why not, then, a truly international glyph, for both Latin and English speakers, which combine "&" and "and"?
And one even more difficult, for us poor Italians: a merge between "&" and "e".</div>

Y in Spanish does stand for "and." The ampersand "&" also stands for "and" in English. Are you saying you would like to see an ampersand that incorporated the letters a, n, and d? That seems somewhat unnecessary then--though that very redundant mark would sure be interesting to see. If not I think the true combination would be of the "y" and the "&".

As far as for Italians, the & does come out of Latin's "et," which is why many ampersands still retain the shape of the et. So the e does exist in the ampersand currently.

		<div class="commentbody">I will try to clarify what I meant, since my sarcasm could’ve made my point not clear enough.

<cite>in the Spanish speaking world […] both the ampersand and the "y" are used, for differing reasons having to do with taste and preference</cite>
So it is also in the rest of the non-Spanish-speaking world. Except that they don’t use "y", but whatever word means "and" in their language, English included (admittedly, in a Typophile’s thread, maybe the same you cite, there is a report of & used sometimes in Turkey for "versus").

<cite>I am really wondering is whether there exists some hybrid of the y/et y/& that could speak bilingually. A Spanish/English ampersand.</cite>
There’s nothing English in the &, more than in any letter of the Latin alphabet (and, obviously, there’s nothing inherently Spanish in the y). So, such hybrid would be between a Latin letter and a Latin ligature.

My point is that it would be exactly as redundant and unnecessary as a y/& mark.

		<div class="commentbody">I have read more than one book with pictures of typewriter keyboard layouts in different lands. I do not recall ever seeing a symbol that was a stylized "Y" on a Spanish-language typewriter layout, either for Latin America or for Spain, used as a symbol for "and".

Indeed, as noted in this thread, in Spanish, "y" is a word, just as "a" and "I" are words in English. Words that happen to be one letter long. In English, that wouldn't be a circumstance under which Y could function as a vowel, but Spanish orthography is different.

And, as noted, this fact does make a typographical symbol which hybridizes the Spanish word for "and" with the ampersand, a stylized "et", a typographical symbol for "and", seem like a bizarre idea, rather than the natural idea it <em>would</em> be if, in fact, a Spanish-speaking area did have a distinctive typographical symbol for "and".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What's bizarre is not seeing the possibilities.
Having an ampersand that subtly hints at a "y"
(without sabotaging its general use) would be a
very nice touch in a font focused on Spanish-
speaking countries (such as a font for a Spanish
newspaper).

Look at the ampersand in Triplex-Italic. It's
pretty normal-looking, but it also quite nicely
alludes to the "E"+"t". That's good design.

		<div class="commentbody">Spanish used "et" but stopped using it around the same time it stopped using "ca" (modern "porque"), which, granted, was long before it stopped using ß.  Honestly part of the reason that a lot of ampersands to me stand out in Spanish is that you pretty much never see "y" capitalized and (almost always) the ampersand is at capital height.  Sticking out isn't necessary I think the right thing to do when it's a weak vowel that often is absorbed into the preceding or following letter.  Plus, it means the symbol gets multiple pronunciations depending on what comes after it: Fernando & Isabel (Fernando e Isabel) vs. David & Carla (David y Carla).</div>

Actually in English the ampersand isn't really used to save space, plus it <em>can</em> serve as more than an "and" - something it could also do in Spanish. We had a nice thread about that once - where is it?

"Letters made to look like animals or nuts & bolts are not uncommon."

"Because of its high level of modularity and reliance on the basic line & circle, Futura presents us with much more uniform –therefore ambiguous– word shapes than Gill Sans."

Not at all. I don’t remember any case, at least.

Don’t get me wrong. As a type designer interested in revivals, I love ampersands and I’d love to use them when appropriate, but contemporary Spanish users don’t think ampersands as belonging to their language. Admittedly, this can change at some point in the future, but it’s not that easy.</div>

All in all this is a very enlightening thread, as I was hoping to gain more knowledge about the meaning of language by comparison.

Cristobal, that was very helpful. It sounds to me as if there could be some use for a mark as this, once the shock of "otherness" wears off. But you'll have that with anything new. As far as changing in the future, perhaps this is a start.

I'd still love to see some more examples. If anyone in the vast Spanish-speaking world found it useful, that's more than enough reason to design for it. Don't you think?
