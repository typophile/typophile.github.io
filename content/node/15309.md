    is now active Central and South American type production also, which I'm sure
    those from there will tell you about.  "

  body: "To me, Rongel (and really the crux of Feliciano's work) is more continental.
    Erin, look to South America for the forefront of \"Latin\" type design. There
    are in fact many examples on Typophile, like this current one:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/14975\r\n\r\nAnd
    don't forget to check out this main \"hub\": http://www.letraslatinas.com/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "If you are looking for historical Spanish types, then M\xE1rio Feliciano
    is your man. He is Portuguese, but has done masterly work reviving historical
    Spanish types. (There were no printers per se in Portugal, so the Iberian models
    all come from Spain. And most of those were based upon contemporary French, Italian,
    and German models.) \r\n\r\nBesides Rongel, M\xE1rio has released Merlo, and has
    several more Spanish types in the works: Geronimo, Eudald, Monteros, Salustiana...\r\n\r\nhttp://felicianotypefoundry.com/\r\n\r\nFor
    contemporary Spanish type, one might check out Type-O-Tones:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.type-o-tones.com/"
