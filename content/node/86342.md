body: Linotye, URW, Bitstream, etc all have different versions of Folio, some with
  only regular widths, others with condensed, and some with italics.  Which one should
  I buy?

  body: "As Folio was originally released by the Bauer foundry, the Linotype version
    should be closest to the original designs, because Linotype bought the Bauer types.\r\nHowever,
    i think that the Scangraphics Folio version is also very close to the original
    and it offers one more weight. Same goes for the URW++ version which has even
    10 weights. Decide which widhts you really need."

  body: The Bitstream version contains an italic, and some of the Bitstream library
    was digitized from Linotype sources, but with superior quality.  Is that the case
    here?
