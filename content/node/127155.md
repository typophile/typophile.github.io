  am not a type designer nor do I have experience in type or computer related graphic
  design, however I am very enthusiastic about good Arabic fonts. I was looking at
  mycommunitydubai.com (no I am not from Dubai) and found this rather nice looking
  font embedded in an image. Is it possible anyone could identify this font to me,
  I sort of like it and want to use it in my word documents. Maybe a link to where
  I could download it (if it's free) or purchase it. \r\nThanks\r\n\r\nThe link: https://www.mycommunitydubai.com/media/318/DDFC%202500x713%20web%20banner.jpg"
