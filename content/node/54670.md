  body: This isn't type. Two different a's. Very irregular x-height. I don't think
    it is even calligraphy, rather an attempt at drawing blackletter calligraphy.

  body: "Can you tell whether this is stamped in metal or is it wood? And Justin...
    someone definitely \"lettered\" this before it was made into a \"sign\" which
    is what it appears to be. And the \"a's\" are not as dissimilar as you think,
    only the weights.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: Thanks Michael. I had been looking at as a 2D photocopy. Now I can see it
