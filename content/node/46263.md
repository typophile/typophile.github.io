  thing, replace 3 glyphs with 3 other glyphs contextually. Some day maybe Adobe et
  al will allow for one to many substitutions.\r\nIn the mean time, here is a screen
  grab of my code. The only way I got it to work was to make a succession of 3 lines
  of code to do what it seems one line should work. I am sure Karsten or someone else
  has done it far more elegantly so I am hoping they will show us the better way to
  do it.\r\nIn the following, I am substituting the combinations TT, TTY, and TY with
  alternates for better spacing. I am repeating similar code for smallcap version
  in succeeding lines. The last few lines are just part of another substitution.\r\n\r\nHere

  body: "The first line: sub T' T by T.alt2;\r\nLooks like you're substituting instances
    of two T's with a single \"TT\" glyph (T.alt2), and this alt is a ligature?\r\n\r\nThen
    in the second line you're substituting instances of T.alt2 plus T.alt plus T plus
    Y with T.alt3.\r\n\r\nThe third line substitutes instances of T.alt2 plus T with
    T.alt.\r\n\r\nHave I interpreted this correctly? Correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a bit confusing not knowing exactly what these alternate glyphs look like, but
    a few things jump out at me here: What are the apostrophes (quotesingle) for?
    I'm accustomed to using the quotesingle after the key glyph in a class definition
    for kerning, eg:\r\n_kern01: a' a.1 a.2 agrave aacute acircumflex adieresis [etc
    etc]\r\n\r\nIn that example a.1 and a.2 are stylistic alternates, and the other
    a's are the familiar western diactritics.\r\n\r\nBut in the code box for defining
    OT features I've never found quotesingle to be of any use. This is how I code
    similar sequences to your calt examples:\r\n\r\nsub T T by T_T;\r\nsub T T Y by
    T_T_Y;\r\nsub T_T Y by T_T_Y;\r\n\r\nThat coding works, compiles without a hiccup.
    It's good practice by the way to use an underscore in the names of ligature glyphs
    to avoid coincidences with standard unicode glyph names.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    T's for two, but rather an alternate form of T for one of them, much like it's
    becoming popular to replace the regular f by narrower ones in certain letter cominations
    instead of using dedicated f_i, f_l, &c., &c. ligatures.\r\n\r\nBut then again,

    are no inside spaces that would need adjustment.)"

  body: "Okay I tried coding with the apostrophe and now understand how the coding
    works. The glyph before the apostrophe is replaced by the alternate after \"by\"
    if the glyphs preceding \"by\" appear in the specified sequence, a contextual
    substitution.\r\n\r\nNo, sorry Chris, I don't know a more elegant way of coding
    than that.\r\n\r\n<em>Ligatures are an easy solution, but as Szabolcs mentions,
    ligatures\u2019 inside spaces of course will not adjust if the typographer applies
    letterspacing to the text.</em>\r\n\r\nTrue, but in the case of a narrow substitute
    f, if letterspacing is applied the need for the narrow f may eliminated and the
    typographer may want to turn off CALT and use the stock f instead, or face the
    very real possibility of people laffing at their work.\r\n\r\nI understand your
    point---ligatures can't be adjusted for interior space once they're drawn and
    programmed in the font. Contextual alternates have the advantage of complicity
    with whatever letterspacing the user applies. But the more letterspacing used,
    the less need there is for ligatures. By a similar token, the more letterspacing
    used, the less need there is for contextual alternates designed to compensate
    for interior space and avoid lateral collisions that look awkward when the font
    is used with stock spacing out of the box.\r\n\r\nI've designed sans serif text
    fonts for private clients which are equipped with ligatures for common combinations,
    eg: ff, ffy, ft, fft. When making them I tested using stock spacing and with differing
    amounts of letterspacing applied, and wound up designing the ligatures with an
    amount of interior space that works in most situations. That's how you design
    ligatures. They have to work with letterspacing in mind, and with no letterspacing
    at all. \r\n\r\nFor a lower case it's not a big issue because letterspacing is
    used in tiny amounts, rarely in copious fashion. Capitals however, can take vast
    amounts of tracking out and still look good. In that case, some typographers will
    decide not to use ligatures at all because they \"look funny\", while others have
    a broader view of things and will use ligature capitals even with generous spacing.
    Do it in InDesign with Optical Kerning switched on, and InD positions the ligatures
    relative to single glyphs so that you get nice even density. I don't think it
    looks funny at all. With optical kerning turned off it looks silly. With optical
    kerning on it looks fine and natural, even tho the ligatures were designed to
    work at close quarters. The reason it still works is this: most ligatures have
    the same or very comparable optical density to single glyphs, so there is no reason
    why they shouldn't look alright with letterspacing applied. It's just that we're
    not used to seeing ligatures very often full stop. Get use to looking at them
    in concert with other glyphs and suddenly your prejudice evaporates. \r\n\r\nj

  body: "Szabolcs and Karsten are correct, I am avoiding the liga feature on purpose.
    I am using calt not just to avoid the TT ligature, but to help minimize difficult
    kerning issues such as TY and TT. The T.alt glyphs are just shortened crossbar
    left or right options to tighten the big spaces. The 3 alts are a short left bar,
    a short right bar and both bars shortened. This eliminates the need for many ligatures
    to do the same job. To use liga, I would need TY, YT, TV, VT, TW, WT, TT, and
    TTY in both caps and smallcaps and 7 lines of code to do what I did in calt with
    3 glyphs and 3 lines of code.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nHere is a screendump. The blue

    I wasn't suggesting you use LIGA to do the same job, but discussing the relationship
    between spacing and the related need for either contextual alternates or ligatures
    to solve awkward combinations in a lower case; and the rather different relationship
    that exists between spacing and capitals. When discussing LIGA I should have termed
    it DLIG anyway, as LIGA is for \"standard\" ligatures.\r\n\r\nAny particular reason
    why you're solving TT with short bar alternate T's? I'm not saying it's bad or
    undesirable in any way, just curious as to your rationale on this combo. A lot
    of fonts substitute TT with a joined pair TT ligature because (I guess) it's neater,
    and few people complain about it.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
