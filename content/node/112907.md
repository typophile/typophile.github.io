  body: I would like to see Vogue and Tempo revived. A <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/tempo-heavy-condensed/">few</a>
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/tempo-rr/">weights</a> of Tempo
    have been digitized, but only a few. The closest thing to Vogue is James Montalbano's
    <a href="http://www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/vf-sans-complete-family/">VF Sans</a>,
    but it's not really the same thing. These aren't exactly "rare" as metal faces
    go, but it's surprising to me that they have not made it to the digital world.

  body: I remember Vogue from some record jackets and CRACKED magazine. I'm afraid
    I thought this Intertype take on Futura was one of the ugliest typefaces I saw
    in serious use, so I'm not surprised no one wanted to revive it. Back in the 1960s,
    it was associated with very cheaply printed material, from people who couldn't
    afford a genuine Linotype machine.

    besides that, Vogue and Tempo are as different from Futura as any other geometric
    sans serifs from that era. They were definitely designed to be substitutes, but
    they weren't exact copies. They had unique qualities of their own. Tempo had a
    very lovely cursive italic in the lighter weights."

  body: "@Mark Simonson:\r\n<cite>John, ugly doesn't prevent a font from being usable.
    Pretty isn't everything.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhile this is undeniably true, in general
    a typeface needs to be aesthetically appealing to commend itself to those who
    use and purchase fonts. I wouldn't set a high bar for this, but I found Vogue
    to be distinctly unattractive, and its former use creates negative associations.\r\n\r\nAnd
    this makes it unlikely to appeal to advertisers, the number one source of demand
    for typefaces. Also, as a text face, it's not particularly effective; it isn't,
    say, Ionic No. 5 - acceptable in appearance, and highly legible.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    another killer for a typeface, I believe, is looking \"dated\". Revivals can have
    subtle changes that fix that, of course. This, for example, is why we don't see
    much Cheltenham these days, although it's readily available. Even one of my favorites,
    Cloister Oldstyle, seems to have this flaw to a degree."
