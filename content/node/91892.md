  themselves thus.  Even neutral clothing express neutrality.

  body: "It is true that the letters of the alphabet are abstractions. A particular
    impression of a letter on a particular piece of paper, whether through printing
    or writing, is something concrete.\r\n\r\nA typeface is also, to a limited extent,
    abstract, but it closely defines a particular physical realization. (And if one
    is picky about the \"correct\" meaning of font, a 20a pile of lead, or a computer
    file ending in .otf, is something concrete too, although not a written representation
    of a letter.)"

    those Manolo Blahniks, they just gotta be Bodoni.

    pairs, which are used until completely worn out?

    I am indeed no constructivist.\r\n\r\nAnd so I think that typefaces are the flesh
    in which letters become incarnate... which, of course, no doubt saves Helvetica
    25's family jewels."
