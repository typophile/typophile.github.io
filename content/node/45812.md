body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not into comic-sans styled typefaces
  at all, but happens that I need to find this font for this project. Can anybody
  please give me a hand on identifying what this is? It looks quite familiar from
  comic books, but I just can't remember what this is...\r\n\r\nI guess the font at
  the top is all compressed and stuff, so maybe should reference from the \"company
  ltd\" line instead.\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated![img:sites/default/files/old-images/SDClogo1_5674.jpg]"
