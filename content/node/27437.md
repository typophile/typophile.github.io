  for freelance typographical designers to take on projects for our Academic Division.
  \ Ideally we are looking for people with at least three years experience, perhaps
  previous academic book publishing experience, photoshop (some experience), Quark
  (lots of experience), the projects will involve text and plate work.  If anyone
  is interested please send a CV and samples of work to the email address I have set
  up: typographers_oup@hotmail.co.uk\r\n\r\nMany thanks, I look forward to hearing
  from anyone interested.\r\n\r\nNadiah Al-Ammar\r\n(Academic EDP, Oxford University
