  the end credits. I'm looking for a modern, geometric sans-serif font. If memory
  is not failing me the letters had a capsule like cylindrical shapes. Almost like
  FF Din with few distinctive characters, particularly the letter 'a'. Below, I have
  drawn it from my memory.   \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nSB[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pink_4005.jpg]"
