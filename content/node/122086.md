body: I was working on a logo for an electric bicycle company and after drawing the
  few glyphs needed for the logo, I thought it would be interesting to flesh out the
  whole font. I was thinking that making the tops and bottoms of the glyphs line up
  horizontally with no overshoots would give the thing a lot of forward momentum.
  And I am hoping it might work well as a web font (for not real  large copy blocks)
  since there will need to be very little hinting. I am liking it but it is still
  early in the design stage so it's a good time for a critique.

  body: "I actually like the way the strokes of the k's are flush right. But I agree
    there is something a little uncomfortable about them.\r\n\r\nI have increased
    the angle of the arms a bit and I think they look more K-ish now. \r\n\r\nI may
    push them around a bit more when I look at everything in context.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/k_6070.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks, Vladimir. The engineers I am working with got a kick out of the square
    wheels link.\r\n\r\nThe supporting graphics all around this font will be round,
    round, round. I thought a square based font would contrast that. And I was hoping
    that the sharp edged base lines and cap and x heights might give a strong sense
    of horizontal motion. Or speed even.\r\n\r\nInstead of wheels, I was kind of basing
    the letter shapes on the tubing that bicycle frames are made from. Evenly weighted
    strokes with apparent geometric circular bends.\r\n\r\n\"Apparent\" being the
    key word. I know actual geometric circles coming off straight edges look abrupt
    and need to be adjusted optically. I had to do a LOT of that kind of adjusting
    with these shapes and I did it mostly by feel.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there
    was any agreed upon formula for these kind of optical adjustments or does everybody
    just futz with things until they feel right?\r\n\r\nBTW, Vlad, I LOVE your magical
    pen stereoscopic drawings! Is there anywhere I might see more of them?\r\n"

    be too literal like in this bicycle font!\r\nhttp://www.wielertaal.nl/2011/02/16/bicycle-font-bicycle-typogram/\r\nThanks
    about the 3D work!"
