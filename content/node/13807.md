  characters evolved from several hand written or cursive letterforms. Some of the
  most notable are various [[uncial]] forms and those of the [[Carolingian Minuscule|carolingian
  minuscule]]. As the handwritten characters evolved, they developed [[ascender|ascenders]]
  and [[descender|descenders]] that extended beyond the [[baseline]] and [[x-height]].
  Larger characters, often differing in form from the smaller characters, were used
  to demarcate important names or the beginnings of pages or sections. These larger
  characters were often based on [[lapidary]] forms.\r\n\r\nThe name <em>lowercase</em>
  is derived from the practice of placing the printing case of miniscule characters
  below the case of [[capital|caps]].\r\n\r\nSee also [[Uppercase]]."
