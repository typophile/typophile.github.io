  posting this <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/read.php?file=/4105/33192.html">link</a>
  to a critique I started there. Any UC input is greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Sorry
  about the exclusivity of the thread. The logotype is being kept somewhat under wraps,
  but I got approval to seek limited Typophile advice at this stage in the process.
  I&#39;ll post it here for general critique as soon as it&#39;s further on in the
  approval process.
