  of mine, who believes \"Zapfino\" can never be used in graphic design or art to
  produce \"amazing\" work.\r\n\r\nI personally think typefaces are like tools, each
  with a spectrum of uses or applicable scenarios. Some typefaces have a wide spectrum
  of uses while some have a much narrower window. I think to suggest that a typeface
  can never be used to produce beautiful work is underestimating human creativity
  and the infinity of creative possibilities.\r\n\r\nI have tried to find examples
  of Zapfino used amazingly but have not managed the knock-out punch. I would greatly
  appreciate help in locating these.\r\n\r\nPlus what do you guys think about this
  debate in general.\r\nIts my first time here so be nice. Thank you."

    typeface itself is bad \u2013 but because it's a common typeface found on consumer
    computers, and thus is used in endless amateur publications. Combined with its
    distinctive looks, this has the unfortunate and rather unfair effect of making
    it associated with amateurism; all typeface \"meanings\" are, of course, socially
    contructed, and this would play into that.\r\n\r\nZapfino is certainly not the
    only good typeface that's underused for this reason."

  body: "I went to Identifont to have a look at Zapfino.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem to
    have been as popular as Times Roman or Papyrus, or even Palatino and Optima. But
    I did find it scary.\r\n\r\nBoth Zapfino and the completely different Zapfino
    Two are <em>script</em> faces. While I think one could make good use of them,
    say, on an album cover, and it certainly is narrow to think that script faces
    are only good for wedding invitations, their narrower domain of applicability
    reduces their opportunities to be used well.\r\n\r\nUsing a face for a wildly
    inappropriate purpose, after all, is using it badly. Being popular hasn't stopped
    Goudy Old Style from being used well on occasion."

    mention that there's actually an Arabic version of Zapfino in the works...  :->\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I don't use it much, but I think Zapfino is under-rated. So many alternate
    glyphs! It's commonly used by people with MS Word, but if you start using the
    alternates it can take on a different form.\r\n\r\n(I'd post an example image,
    but it's too hard.)\r\n"

    Two is. A record album, yes - but one of classical compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus
    Mozart."

  body: I have used it a few times for very specific uses, eg my brothers wedding
    invitation, and that was when it had just been published. It HAS influenced my
    own style of writing and lettering because it is very fluent and still playful.

    small. Zapfino is gorgeous in long lines at small sizes. It turns into something
    else when it\u2019s just one word or a title or a heading."

    of Herr Zapf \"flourishes and larger than life characters\" were used with discretion
    to give sparkle or to \"fill\" a needy space. \r\n\r\nWhen he conceived this font
    the technology was not available to see its full potential through."
