body: "Hey everyone, it's been a while since I've posted, but I just realized that
  the sides of my nerdiness are overlapping, so it's a perfect opportunity to come
  on back!\r\n\r\nI'm a proud owner of an OGD (Motorola DROID 1), and I've been rooted
  using CyanogenMod for about a year now. I've always been happy with it, but one
  day, I got fed up with the standard Droid fonts from Ascender Corps that comes packaged
  with Android.\r\n\r\nI decided that I wanted other typefaces on my phone instead.
  Thus I replaced, the monospace font with DejaVu Sans Mono, and then switched that
  out for Terminus. I replaced Droid Serif with Linux Libertine G (just because I'm
  praying that one day, Android will support Graphite), and Droid Sans with Liberation
  Serif. I was so happy for such a long time.\r\n\r\nHowever, now I've updated to
  the RC2 of CM7 for my phone, and the system fonts folder has changed. No matter
  what method I use, whenever I try to replace the fonts, I get a \"bootloop.\" \r\n\r\nI've
  already posted a thread on this matter over at [[http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/|CM
  Forums]], but no one seems to have good suggestions.\r\n\r\nI'm really hoping that
  someone here is Android-nerdy enough to help me figure this out.\r\n\r\nWhat's really
  screwing me up is the new /system/fonts/ folder setup which now has a DefaultFont.ttf(and
  variations, i.e., DefaultFont-Bold.ttf, etc.). I don't know how to handle it, nor
  which to replace.\r\n\r\nAny and all suggestions are greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThis
  issue has been solved. Feel free to read up [[http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/topic/17688-font-repacement-issues-solved/|here]]."
