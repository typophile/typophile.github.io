  we were going with Mr Eaves Sans Small Caps, but the owner isn't 100% on it. Since
  then I've only found a few that worked but none with that felt right X factor. Thought
  maybe I could find some help here.\r\n\r\nWe're a production/post-production boutique
  that makes commercials, animation, etc, but there's also a heavy focus on film.
  We've made 2 documentaries and one feature film. So there's that bit of duality
  going on here. The name of the company is TigerLily Media and the logo comes from
  an old asian legend about how the tiger lily flower came to get it's name.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    him (Perpetua, Linotype Pilgrim, Joanna...)
