body: "Hi, I'm looking for a sans serif typeface to be used in a logotype and as headlines
  in a Flash magazine. I'm using a handwritten script, maybe <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/corinthia/\">Corinthia</a>
  or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/ambiance-bt/\">Ambiance BT</a>,
  for some of the headlines, and I was thinking a more masculine sans would be a good
  balance. Right now the client is using Helvetica Neue, I think it's too friendly
  and corporate for this project: \"a high-end, personality-driven New York-centric
  online magazine.\"\r\n\r\nDIN? Gotham? Too obvious? I'm liking the condensed sans
  serifs, Trade Gothic Condensed etc, but then I guess I'd need a THIRD face for body
  text? Oy. I've never been great at pairing typefaces. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nErica"

  body: To me DIN and Gotham both feel even more friendly than Helvetica. Maybe try
    a gruff, masculine alternative like Folio, Venus, Bureau Grotesque, FF Dagny,
    Neuzeit, FF Bau, Monotype Grotesque or squarisch sans like Hydra, Eurostile, Gridnik
    or the new Forza.

  body: "Those are very stylish, vigorous scripts, and don't strike me as being particularly
    femme.\r\nI don't think you need a butch sans for balance (just sufficient weight),
    but I do think that faces with a small x-height would match well; faces with a
    large x-height might appear clumsy in comparison."

  body: "Thanks for all the suggestions! \r\n\r\nAndreas, Lapidaira is amazing, congrats!
    It would fit right in for this audience, but a lot of competitors are using pointy-top
    fonts so I think I need a distinction. Saved it for later.\r\n\r\nKupfers, you
    have just exploded my brain with new typefaces. Venus and Bureau are catching
    my eye. Hydra is super cool but would it be too feisty next to the script? Matching/clashing
    is the hard part for me.\r\n\r\nNick, that is a helpful thought. The roundness
    of the H Neue was what annoyed me, but maybe it's actually the x-height. (Your
    Bodoni Egyptian is also gorgeous btw.) What else do you think about when matching
    typefaces? "
