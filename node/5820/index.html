		<div class="commentbody">I agree with everything cristian wrote, except maybe the &quot;g&quot; is OK (even though I favor the binocular form with the <i>open</i> bottom). I'd add that if you're going to be funky with the lc &quot;el&quot;, tilt it the other way (but that might throw off your spacing too much in a bitmap font). <BR> <BR>Also: one can afford to be more flamboyant with the caps, and I think the UC &quot;G&quot; is cool (just maybe some &quot;tuck-in&quot; at the join), but I worry about the spacing of the UC &quot;Q&quot;, since there really isn't any kerning in bitmap fonts (btw, the UC &quot;R&quot; is killer). Since you have two pixels of descender space, maybe bring down the tail lower and steeper, and cut the right sidebearing by a pixel. Lastly, I'd lose the last pixel on the tail of the UC &quot;J&quot; (you could bring that down another pixel too). <BR> <BR>As for the letterspacing, do try 2-pixel gaps - it worked for Carter/MS: Verdana's biggest advantage over Tahoma is just that (although it uses up a lot more space). <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Itay, it's great to see work in hand-anti-aliasing: it's the ideal method for on-screen readability. Unfortunately, OSes don't support it well. It's a shame, but things like BitFonter are swimming against the current. <BR> <BR>I've been doing this stuff since '98, but there's still no good way to deliver them&hellip; Anyway, some ideas: <BR>- The darker the font, the better you can apply the grays. With one-pixel bodies it's pretty hard. <BR>- Resist the urge to place a lot of grays: it's better to use less grays than more, simply because blurriness is worse than aliasing. For example, those bits at the tops of ascenders are distracting. <BR>- Keep the bodies of the letters as black as possible. For example, in the &quot;a&quot; the bottom-right gray is good, but the top-right gray is bad. <BR>- Be careful how much you show your work in public: it takes a lot of work to get the grays <i>just right</i>, but it's very WYSIWYS: What You See Is What You Steal&hellip; <BR>- Consider doing an outline font to match: give away the bitmap-only version, sell the full version. <BR> <BR>Take this to heart: you have to be extremely pragmatic. You have to make decisions that seem formally incorrect to arrive at good readability. <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; point 3 <BR> <BR>Don't try to use grays in a too-sophisticated manner (even though it's tempting). The low resolution of screens is still a very real limit. So for example in your lc &quot;a&quot; the gray pixel where the <i>top</i> of the bowl connects to the stem is supposed to convey a gentle taper of the stroke (right?) but that sort of thing is too subtle* - it just creates more problems in terms of contrast against the background. On the other hand the gray pixel where the <i>bottom</i> of the bowl meets the stem is good, because it helps reduce the clotting. <BR> <BR>* Note that you have more room for such subtlely in darker weights (and in greater bit-depths). <BR> <BR>&gt; sell <BR> <BR>I think bitmap fonts are very hard to sell - they have to be cheap or free. And in my case since I don't make enough fonts during the year, I have to keep a high price bracket. Plus the limit on the number of bitmap fonts that can exist in the market is much smaller than for outline fonts (because of resolution - especially for aliased fonts). <BR> <BR>Here's a word set in Mana-16PPEM: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8249.gif" alt="mana_dog"> <BR> <BR>If I can get my a-a bitmap fonts to actually work on Windows* then I will give them away, and sell the full (outline + bitmap) versions to people who get hooked. <BR> <BR>* MacOs would be great too, but it's secondary in terms of users - I want to enable the delivery of large quantities of text to/by &quot;the masses&quot;, not pretty layouts. <BR> <BR>&gt; outline font <BR> <BR>Well, making a good outline font is a lot of work (and the technical task of matching the bitmaps is a little bit of additional work), but it's not a mountain. The tricky part is embedding the bitmaps into the outlines so they work right - the beta version of BitFonter I was using couldn't get it to work. And now MacOS seems to hate bitmap fonts. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello guys, <BR> <BR> I think that greyscale fonts are very promising, but the design problems actually still on the classic pixel fonts. More than 20 years and it seems that many good fonts are showing and growing on internet, as a real need for many designers.  <BR> <BR>Nintendo-like layout solved the resolution design problem 15 years before kiok layout style just start growing tasting all the posibilities of working dot by dot. <BR> <BR>Now bitmap fonts works well on flash, but many designers work on html for consider that flash is a waste of time, to boring to wait the loading time, now how much years have to pass to saw more than 50% of internet little Flash-pixel fonts working well? &hellip;we can wait a long time for the color fonts as a real thing, btw is interesting to try add greys, but every size needs a diferent grey trheatment. <BR> <BR>Itay; please finish your gaya version without greys, taste in a paragraph text, and think about <BR>today. Your design is great and simple, so then you got a &quot;real usefull&quot; font taht many designers will want to use, <BR> <BR>MH.</div>

[&hellip;] On the other hand  <BR>&gt; the gray pixel where the bottom of the bowl <BR>&gt; meets the stem is good, because it helps  <BR>&gt; reduce the clotting. <BR> <BR>actually, the dark grey pixel in the place where the bowl connects to the stem is to reduce clotting too. i did the same with the allmost all the other letters. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8275.gif" alt="lc a test"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">a question - how bad it is for a font not to have [europian] accented characters? i wasnt planning adding accented char and now that i tried to add them, it looks extremely strange. the whole font has the hieght of 10pixels, and adding accents would require at least 2 more pixels on the top. is there any way of doing this differntly?</div>
