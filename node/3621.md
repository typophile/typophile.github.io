body: I&#39;m pretty sure this is a hacked-up customization, but it&#39;s based on
  something. Any ideas on the &#34;Grainger&#34; face? If you have guesses on the
  slogan, go for it, but I think it&#39;s a super-slanted Akzidenz Grotesk. Close-enough
  is good enough for these. Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28674.gif"
