  creating logos. I need some help in improving this logo. I am stuck at the moment.
  So any criticism would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe company name is called
  Bolling Steel. The client name is Bolling and they own a steel company, so that's
  the background to the logo.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: I wanted to play around with the idea of the "I" beam.. so that was my execution.
    Not sure how successful it is :(

    The company is a family run business.

  body: "You're not off to a bad start. Here are some of my thoughts though with what
    you've shown here:\r\n-Steer away from outlined type. It feels too weak for the
    strength you want to communicate.\r\n-Make sure all your elements are perfectly
    aligned. Use guides, grids, rules, etc. Be as precise as you can, because with
    today's software, it's easy to be.\r\n-You've already done this, but don't worry
    about color until you come up with a solid mark.\r\n-Stay away from 3-D effects
    like embossing and drop-shadow.\r\n-Do research.\r\nGoogle \"steel\" and flip
    through the photographs\r\nGo to www.istockphoto.com and do the same thing (stay
    away from the vector art there though, it may be too cartoony for what you're
    after)\r\nGo to Wikipedia and read up\r\n\r\nHope some of this helps. Good luck.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Options in the first row are far too delicate for the steel manufacturer.
    Second versions in 2nd and 3rd lines resemble a computer input field with an I
    looking like a cursor.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'd say the first row has the most potential,
    but it probably needs to have more weight and presence."

  body: "first row, first column. i thought that one had a certain elegance in the
    shape to the \"crest,\" and i could picture that as a placard welded onto steel.
    or riveted--i would like to see what 4 small white circles, on in each corner,
    would look like. \r\n\r\ni think steel--rivets. but don't overdo it.\r\n\r\nalso,
    with steel, who knows, maybe there's no reason to go color. i don't mind the use
    of white, grey, and black. however, regardless of color, the value of the two
    forms, the I and the B bother me. because the I beam is white it stands out most
    clearly, and i read this as IB--the letter I, the letter B. so try switching their
    colors.\r\n\r\nthat might not work tho--seems tricky to make a letter have an
    I beam without saying I."

  body: Thank you everyone for your critique! I updated my logo. I added some thickness...
    and some rivets.. Let me know what you think. Do you still see the "I" and the
    "B"?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bollingsteel_09aug10_6578.jpg]

  body: "I think if you take the rivets out of the middle option and paint the mark
    in one color, you will have an <em>excellent</em> mark. Rebar is going to be easy
    to see and it won't be as decorated and fancy compared to how it is now. Then
    pair it with a larger bolder type (perhaps set it in two lines) and that's it,
    you got a winner.\r\n\r\nPS. Oh, and if you feel like keeping rivets, consider
    moving them into the whitespace between I's vertical strokes."

- body: "I agree that it needs to be one color because splitting it up compromises
    legibility. I can see a roman numeral two and a 3, or Il3. Stick to one color,
    or keep each letter completely one color. \r\n\r\nI think the rivets could work
    well, but they're not quite right yet. Maybe use them on the outer corners to
    rivet the whole logo to the background? Play around.\r\n\r\nI'd also try Bolling
    Steel on two lines because right now, it's too small compared to the mark, and
    it risks being read as \"Boiling Steel\" which is, well, just weird. Setting it
    in all caps might be the problem? Small caps may help, or perhaps all lowercase?
    It's one of those words that needs precise kerning, too, so once you settle on
    a layout and/or font, kerning could make you crazy. \r\n\r\nOnce you're crazy,
    you'll officially be an experienced designer. :)"

    to read IB, just B, right? If so, you really need to work on making it more cohesive.
    It read IB so clearly to me that I never even considered it was something else.
    \r\n\r\nThe company initials are not an option for obvious reasons. Have you tried
    exploring shapes that are not based on a letter? "

    sure how successful they are. I feel like they are lacking and not really all
    that sophisticated. \r\n\r\nFor the \"B\" Logo I made the letters all one color
    so it doesn't read I, B. I also moved the rivets to the 4 corners. Let me know

  body: i think you should put the rivet inside the negative space of the IB  like
    I:B  so it will joint the two elements together who will be seen as one large
    piece. And that Neutralface is absolutly beautifull you should use it.

    but have you tried making the \"holes\" in the B look like a bolt? I think a hexagon
    shape would me more recognicable then a circular rivet.\r\n\r\n"
