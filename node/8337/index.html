I think a list is a great idea, especially if it is such a personal test. It'll make us all feel good. It will, however, not change the world of type-usage out there one bit.  I have my own theory about the success of certain faces and it would be nice to explore at some point how something as despicable as Avantgarde Gothic or something as sickly cute as Optima ever became so popular. But then, your present president took his post with less of a quarter of the adult population of this country having voted for him. One Steve Jobs with an old Linotype catalog in his garage had a bigger influence on the course of typedesign than all living typedesigners together. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A few years ago, a journalist asked me what I thought were the ten most popular typefaces in use today.

The 2001 idea is not bad - but not exactly easy to be sure of as release dates are never clear after a font is launched.

I don't care if the lc &quot;a&quot; has a flawed pedigree - it more than makes up for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand, I'm one of those crazies who thinks that Cheltenham (the real one, not the ITC caricature) deserved its popularity: it has a distinct charm, and a unique readability. I think the fact that it was designed by a non-type-designer tends to mar the objectivity of some stodgy -or overly conservative, or overly pedantic- type designers (like Tracy, as much as I admire him for other things). And maybe the same negative forces are at work in the denial of the true origin of Times - but that's another can of worms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, I thought Cooper university (no, it's not a school where you learn to make chocolate letters) had something like an &quot;IFDB&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>
