  body: Thank you Lex. Unda Circles seems to be almost an exact match. Just tested
    it on the T-26 font setter widget and it is very close. My sample has an extra
    row of dots though which could have been added manually I guess to extend the
    font sidways slightly. You can see there are 4 dots across to make the tops of
    the bowls whereas Unda Circles has three. Great pick though.
