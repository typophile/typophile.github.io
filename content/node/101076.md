    the ID section and the rest of Typophile (you can tell because when an ID is posted
    outside the ID section, nobody replies) the ID section is still part of fostering
    Typophile's image, hence relevance and usefulness. Some type designers -the reason
    Typophile exists- get disgusted and leave when they see their craft disrespected.\r\n\r\nThis
    is not an attack (as it contains no opinion) but a statement of fact:\r\nOn a
    number of occasions Dick has stated that a correct ID is his primary motivation,
    and nothing should inhibit that; he has also confronted people who don't adhere
    to this philosophy. I only single him out because nobody else here has done those
    things.\r\n\r\nI will have to leave it up to moderators and fellow Typophiles
    to decide whether such behavior is actionable. Also however, I would like to request
    some guidance in terms of what somebody like me should do when witnessing IDing
    activity that seems to violate Typophile guidelines, in letter <strong>or</strong>

    But why go it alone? It shouldn't be me against you against this guy or that guy.
    I've said this before: in a community different people are good at different things,
    and <em>together</em> can accomplish much more than individually. For example
    let's say I can often tell when a font is probably \"too good to be true\" (due
    to actually having been making fonts for about 30 years) but let's say Ryuk is
    much better at naming a dozen specific fonts that sort of look like that font,
    and bingo, we uncover the truth*. If I can't do what Ryuk does, should I just
    keep quiet? I'd rather communicate what I can contribute, and see what others
    can do with that. Without my contribution more stuff will slip through the cracks,
    and just because nobody is complaining doesn't mean nobody is offended. Sure sometimes
    things get uncomfortable, but hey, getting in bed with plagiarism is no alternative.\r\n\r\n*
    Like look what happened here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/99822\r\nI smelled
    a rat, then \"R.\" named Modena, then I made an incriminating graphic.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1.
    Have you stopped beating your wife yet?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat would be funny
    if this were a frivolous conversation.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>2. Why are your posting
    counts not shown on this forum?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI don't know. I can take guesses,
    but I really don't see the relevance to this discussion.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Finally,
    Two answers out of Three:</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI don't understand what that means.
    And considering your third answer, it seems to me you're being frivolous, perhaps
    to avoid being pinned down to an answer. Maybe you wrote that to pick and choose
    what you \"really meant\" in the future? If so, how long would you play such a
    tiring, defeatist game?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1. It is not ethical to re-use commercial
    outlines without permission.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe agree.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>2.
    I don't/won't recommend fonts that I feel are probably unethical.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat's
    great to hear, but I have to say I've seen you behave contrary to this. I've never
    seen you be tentative or change your mind. Like in the Cuprum thread I mention
    above, you said \"Very little needs addressing...\" You seem to be totally OK
    with something that virtually any bona fide type designer would think is unethical.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>3.
    I will consider a font unethical if Hrant suspects it to be unethical because
    similarity of design is prima facie suspicious.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat makes
    no sense. I can't see how you could mean it.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I will excuse
    people from developing a negative perception of me.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhat if
    this perception naturally migrates to the whole of Typophile, and thereby to other

  body: "Age and length of involvement in type has nothing to do with integrity and
    concern for fellow designers. People who are not designers don't [have to] care,
    but they've become a huge presence here and that ruins the character of this place.
    Typophile's best purpose is to promote type design, and IDing unethical fonts
    harms that.\r\n\r\nYou can't pretend the ID section is not part of Typophile.
    Disrespecting type design -for example by exhibiting rock-bottom standards of
    what constitutes unethical behavior- makes the whole of Typophile less welcoming
    of people who make fonts, especially the high-quality stuff. They don't want to
    spend their days watching unethical behavior or arguing with people who don't
    know the first thing about type.\r\n\r\nYou might not mind if Typophile was <em>only</em>
    for IDing. But some people will try to prevent that from happening... assuming
    it's not already too late.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAnybody starting a new type forum,
    heed the warning I gave many years ago: IDing fonts isn't useless, but it should
    not be allowed to take over.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Akira1975, Fvilanakis, Jan, HVB, and oldnick,  for ruining the character of Typophile.
    You have insinuated they give nothing  but unethical font  ids. That is patently
    wrong. \r\n\r\nThey give a very professional and competent Typophile face to a
    large number of people. There is  more exposure to good font practices than in
    all the other forums on Typophile combined I would wager.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You're patently putting words in my mouth, and you know it. I guess you will
    use any means necessary (including deleting posts) to cover up the damage you
    do.\r\n\r\nDon't compare yourself to Ryuk, Jodie, Herb and Fivos, who are all
    adequately careful not to promote plagiarism, and have taken corrective action
    as needed. Certainly don't compare yourself to Akira, who -like me- has exposed
    and even confronted unethical behavior. And also not to Nick, who actually makes
    useful things. Jan's stance on font IP (my plagiarism is his \"artistic inspiration\")
    and his withdrawal from difficult questions I personally find problematic, but
    since he doesn't do a lot of IDing it's largely moot. I wonder why you didn't
    mention Steve, who has contributed much more than you... but he doesn't ID fonts
    much, so I guess he doesn't exist for you.\r\n\r\nYou have many role models here.
    A mirror is never one.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There is more exposure to good font
    practices than in all the other forums on Typophile combined I would wager.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYou
    have no idea what you're talking about. For one thing, you've probably spent a
    total of about 5 minutes outside the ID section in the past 9 years. The only
    recent talk of \"good font practices\" in the ID section is when there's a confrontation
    about plagiarism! You're welcome.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the community an inviting place for designers of all skill levels to learn, share
    tips, and promote the art of typeface design. Our policy is clear against making
    personal attacks on the forums; it's one of the few places where we feel the need
    to intervene and make our presence known, as the result on the community is detrimental
    to our mission.\r\n\r\nFor years, the Type ID board has been a place where community
    newcomers can get help on a font they've got their eye on. However, recently it
    has become a place where new posters get accused and verbally accosted for speculative
    crimes. This is unacceptable and injurious to the community at large. This is
    NOT what we are about.\r\n\r\nTo be succinct: <strong>cut it out.</strong> If
