    magazine.. <BR> <BR>i started a THE FACE thread in january/february about this
    FACEfont and was damned sure we had nailed it.. <BR> <BR>but the &#34;R&#34; make

  body: I&#39;m convinced that this is a heavily modified version of Oeiller. Certain
    characters, like the S, match exactly, and the characters that differ would be
    easy to construct from the material of the font itself. Also, the weight matches,
    and some characters, such as the R, have an underlying structure which is so similar
    that is hard to believe it&#39;s just a coincidence.

    target="_blank"> started out with Oeiller</a>, liked it, had it  <BR>customized
    and kept using their own private version.
