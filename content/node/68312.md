  body: OK, I feel like an idiot!  I wonder why the What the Font identifier didn't
    list that as a potential font?  Maybe I misunderstand how that thing works!  Thanks,
    though.  *Duly chastised.*

  body: "OK, that makes sense.  So, here's what really confuses me now, Renko (and,
    BTW, THANK YOU RENKO!) said \"Alien League. But you know that already.\" Which
    I didn't.  So, I thought I had pasted in the name of the font accidentally and
    not realized it when I saw it in the post name (hence the \"i'm an idiot\" comment).
    \ So, just to be through (and to prove what a nerd I am), I just reran WhatTheFont
    on the image again and lo and behold, I had NOT previously had the name of the
    font.\r\n\r\nSo, why the \"but you konw that already\" comment?\r\n\r\nConfused.

    on the Whatthefont-Forum? Who got his answer just a few minutes earlier?"

  body: Wow. I did not know that it had been identified on the WhatTheFont forums.  And
    yes I am one in the same!  I must say, I much prefer this forum to that.  Still,
    thanks for your insight, and patience with me in this matter!
