  stones. I saw one once, about a dozen years ago.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where I
  can purchase one that won't cost an arm and a leg? It's not terribly important if
  it's wood or stone, or if it's carved, sandblasted, laser cut, engraved, etched,
  or whatever, as long as it's both correct and aesthetic. The sample is from England;
  everything else being equal, which it never is, it would probably cost less in the
  USA if for no other reason than shipping.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This might be an idea... \r\n\r\nSearch the local phone book for a headstone/memorial
    carver or Metal Shop that uses a water jet. You'd probably have to supply the
    design, but the final piece would be pretty intricate. \r\n\r\nIf you want that
    hand-hewn look, again, a headstone carver could probably offer those services.
    It might be per letter."

  body: "England? The US? You've got to be kidding. Unless you're looking for celebrity
    art, what you want is the \"Vernissage\" flea market in Yerevan, Armenia. Two
    pertinents things I've purchased from there are a painting of the Armenian alphabet*
    for $40 last Fall, and a full-size hand-carved backgammon board** (cherry or pear
    wood, I forget) with various motifs on one face and \"Papazian\" set in Armenian
    in my Maral font (I gave Roubik a printout) nicely carved on the other face, for
    $25 (although that was in 2000).\r\n\r\n* http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/267395186/\r\n\r\n**
