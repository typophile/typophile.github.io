  be late 1800s, early 1900s british railway signage. Below is a sample of the sort
  of lettering I hope to recreate.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P1090070edit_6226.jpg]\r\n\r\nThere
  are some variations on this theme that I have found so far. I can only assume that
  some are old version and some more recent?\r\nI think this style of lettering may
  sit somewhere between Figgins san serifs and possible Johnston's Underground lettering.\r\n\r\nI
  was wondering if anyone new any information about this style of lettering that would
  be of use to my project?\r\n\r\nThanks. Jonathan"

    years or so.

    sure if it would be an insult or a compliment to mimic or stay away from their
    precedents.\r\n\r\nIn terms of how to make such fonts: just use a grid and \"expanded
    skeletons\" and do no optical correction whatsoever. That's how you would arrive
    at a horrible \"A\" like that for example.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    as a display typeface, not directly mimic them. I would certainly take care to
    optically adjust the letters so that they aren't as clumsy as the examples.\r\n\r\nThe
    image was taken in Moore St station in Birmingham which has apparently been restored
    back to it's original 1930s appearance - whether the signage is historically accurate
    I'm not sure but I presume it is.\r\n\r\nI have plenty of other samples of this
    kind of letter and it is all railway signage and as I say from what I can gather
    at the moment this style of lettering was used around late 1800s / early 1900s
    \ - before Johnston and Gill's typefaces."

    being used for railway signage. I believe it may have been early 1900s. I think
    it may even have been used for the London Underground prior to the Johnston's
    lettering.\r\n\r\n "
