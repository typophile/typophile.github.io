body: Hi, if I have say two fonts and want them generated as a postscript type 1-family,
  where they show up in InDesign under the same family name... which is the easiest
  way to generate them? In FontLab 4.5 that is. I dont want one of them as a clickable
  bold. Thanks

    <BR>should be useful. I also recommend getting Leslie Cabarga&#39;s book &#34;Learn

    <BR>I consider it an essential addition to the FontLab manual.  <BR> <BR>Regards,

  body: 'Adam, when trying to use these guidelines I&#39;ve had no problems before.  <BR>But
    now when trying to generate a family &#40;Mac PS1&#41;which has nor regular and
    with some Style names that are a bit &#34;unusual&#34;  I get problems with the
    suitcases. They all &#40;the suitcases&#41; want to be named the family name/FOND
    name. If I try to bundle them up togeter in one by choosing &#34;All Possible&#34;
    I get problems with duplicates especially with the Bold after checking the Bold
    field. <BR> <BR>To get it right i had to open some of my old  FOG generated fonts
    &amp; checked how those naming convention looked in Fontlab. I then used those
    naming settings as  a template &amp; it worked. The font all show up as a part
    of a family in my font menues. <BR> <BR>Can you confirm that this is the right
    way? Or did I miss something?  <BR> <BR>Attached are 2 images with the different

  body: Peter,  <BR> <BR>I think you&#39;re doing the right thing. However, could
    you send me the fonts off-line to adam at fontlab dot com. I would like to analyze
    them.  <BR> <BR>Thanks,  <BR>Adam
