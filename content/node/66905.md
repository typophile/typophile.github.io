  ago in the UK. The brand sponsored 'Films on Four' if I remember rightly and they
  appeared on the ad break during the film.\r\n\r\nThey were yellow and white type
  over images and they were done brilliantly.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows who did them
  or where I could find them online I would be most greatful.\r\n\r\nMarc"

    YouTube or somewhere. Then we will be better able to help you ID them.

    the UK. Shame on you for pulling his leg.

    everyone on here is UK based, it was a question for those who had seen it here.\r\n\r\nTerminal
    Design, you've dispelled the common myth that Americans don't get sarcasm for
    me. Unless you're an Englishman in New York!"
