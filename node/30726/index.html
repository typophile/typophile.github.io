  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on this logo for awhile now for a class. I was randomly assigned a topic which was measuring devices for cooking, and ended up with the name &ldquo;Measure of Taste&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The specialty shop is supposed to be in Chicago. My positioning statement is, &ldquo;For working professionals who love to cook, Measure of Taste sells high quality measuring devices for cooking, and our knowledgeable staff will help you to find any measuring device you want, even if we have to custom order it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I used Univers Thin Ultra Condensed so the logo can be vertically without being too tall. I shortened up the length of the increments on the right side too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what else to do on it, does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Cutting off the bottoms of the letters causes some problems, especially with the &lsquo;u&rsquo; and &lsquo;a&rsquo;. Your unicase solution for &lsquo;a&rsquo; seems out of place. Maybe try all-caps.</p>
<p>Why are the tick marks on the ruler uneven?</p>
<p>&ldquo;OF&rdquo; just gets lost since it&rsquo;s in a different colour, font, and orientation to the rest of the text. I thought it said &ldquo;on&rdquo; at first.</p>
<p>I also do not like the vertical orientation of the logo. Usually (at least in Canada) when text is placed vertically (such as on the spine of a book or video box) it reads from top-to-bottom, not bottom-to-top. I don&rsquo;t know if this would help in your case though.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, the reason I put it vertical is because mostly of what my professor guided me to do (although I don&rsquo;t agree for the most part), and the tick marks are just like the increments on a ruler, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re uneven. And for the &ldquo;OF&rdquo; in between, I made it more horizontal so it was larger and easier to read, because if I were to use the same vertical style as the other letters, it would be too small and hard to read. I can&rsquo;t really think of any other way to do it, does anyone have any other suggestions?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I tried it in all caps, but it&rsquo;s a little more difficult to read like that, at least vertical, but my professor doesn&rsquo;t want me to make it horizontal</p>

<p>It seems to me that you could set your text horizontally stacked, flush right:
MEASURE
OF TASTE</p>
<p>You could then put your ruler to the right, as in your previous example. The horizontal lines in the Es would echo the tick marks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you stacked Measure of Taste like adnix suggests, it would ressemble the shape of a measuring cup. Most objects used for measuring in cooking are cup-like, not long like a ruler.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the concept of &ldquo;measure&rdquo; in the logo, but where is the &ldquo;taste&rdquo; (of the mouthwatering kind)? These are cooking tools, not laboratory beakers. I&rsquo;m not sure accuracy and measure needs to be the focus.</p>

The only suggestion I would make would be if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, measuring cups tend to have black and red for the tick/increment labels. Maybe try the Measure of Taste in red or just Measure &amp; Taste, leaving the of the way it is.</div>
