body: "\r\nHey guys,\r\n\r\nJust some simple advice needed here from Typophiles far
  greater than myself.\r\n\r\nI'll be rebranding a Bookshop soon that involves an
  interior revamp along with a new logotype that dictates a boutique, well known,
  approachable, fully servicing store with ties to the core of books, type and their
  history.\r\n\r\nIt's called \"The Bookshop at Caloundra\" with emphasis being placed
  on the words \"The Bookshop\".\r\nWe're running away from the disjointed, unconnected
  feel of large chains and department stores for obvious reasons and want to connect
  with real book lovers.\r\n\r\nI've got Caslon Graphique OT on my mind, its a start
  but I feel like there's a lot more out there with a more refined but strong feel.\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsnerflake/caslon_graphique_ot/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=48&sample_text=The%20Bookshop&ft=liga&acs_pt=32\r\n\r\nWhat
  typefaces have you got in mind? I wouldn't mind having an option that pairs well
  with a sans-serif also.\r\n\r\nDan.\r\n"

    identity programmes? I would explore an identity where the tagline \u2018at Caloundra\u2019
    would be in a certain (fixed) typeface and the more important part \u2018The Bookshop\u2019
    would vary all the time, rotating through a certain amount of different and distinctive
    typefaces. This way you can accentuate certain periods, certain genres, etcetera."

  body: Hmm... To me Caslon Graphique gives more a feel of fancy graphics than of
    a good book.

  body: "\r\nI love the idea Bert, like the Typophile header hey? I don't think its
    feasible for the brief, it needs to be low maintenance and low involvement for
    me after the fact and of course, on a budget.\r\n\r\nRiccardo I think you're right.
    I'm sure it was the weight that sold it the first time, I would like to keep tradition
    and in fact use a font with some history, something that book and text lovers
    alike can relate to and also represent their experience and knowledge in the industry
    (although the industry is far removed from its traditions these days).\r\n\r\nBezler
    love the Windsor in context video. I ended up spending the last 20 minutes clicking
    on related videos and I don't even like cats.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for something
    I can embellish with gold ink down the spine of the \"B\" for instance and accents
    on other characters.\r\nAlso I think its important to use sentence case although
    if the shoe fits..."
