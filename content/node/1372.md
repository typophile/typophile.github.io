    27 extra Tees down the line who  <BR>haven&#39;t appeared here yet, and there&#39;s
    a whole week  <BR>left for turning in submissons. <BR> <BR>BTW 09.001. Concept,
    execution, visual impact, colour  <BR>scheme are all flawless. And just like last
    year&#39;s  <BR><i>California Job Case</i> it looks incredibly cool. Which is  <BR>what
    any self-respecting Tee needs to do. Furthermore  <BR>it discouraged me from sending
    in a submission of my  <BR>own. I feel like I simply can&#39;t beat that. <BR>No
    numbers 2 nor 3 yet.

    there are now 34 yet to post&#41;. But it&#39;s all about  <BR>the hype machine...
    We could do a totally blind contest and  <BR>surprise everybody at the end with
    the winning shirt, but  <BR>that&#39;s not very <i>Typophile</i>. <BR> <BR>The
    shirts that arrive late in the game have the advantage  <BR>of coming in as a
    surprise - or maybe they have had more  <BR>time put in on them. But perhaps the
    disadvantage of not  <BR>getting &#39;shopped around&#39; here.

    of assumptions, Hrant, and from them a lot of judgements. That&#39;s pretty sloppy.
    <BR> <BR>You also have a tendancy, I have noticed, to draw passive associations
    &#40;implying an equation of selfishness and professionalism, for example&#41;.
    I understand this as a debating technique &#40;i.e. peppering one&#39;s argument
    with subjective definitions which, if left unchallenged, become misconstrued as
    factual or accurate&#41;, but I&#39;d sooner label that tactic as &#34;weasely&#34;
    than assign such a moniker to those whose motivations you presume to - but could
    not possibly - know. <BR> <BR>You really ought to clean it up a bit.

    to refine myself; wanted to do my part for Typophile - kinda like my paid membership.

    entries came in during the final 2-3 days. That&#39;s typical for a design competition
    of this nature, and certainly was true last year. I&#39;m not one to presume that
    anyone is doing so simply to gain a competitve edge. Most designers are busy spending
    the majority of their time on client work, so putting together a design for Typophile
    requires some extra time somewhere. In the end, the judges will consider all entries
    at the same time for their artistic and creative merit, not for whether they jumped
    the gun and got in early or barely skimmed in before the deadline. <BR> <BR>And
    while I&#39;m here. I gotta say Thanks. It&#39;s always very exciting to do this

    great for the Typophile community. You cats inspire me.

    selfish. Professional.&#34;  <BR> <BR>There is a passive implication that &#34;selfish&#34;
    = &#34;professional&#34; and I think such an equation is simply untrue and unfair.&#42;
    I am a professional, I also teach design, mentor, lecture, write and volunteer.
    All of these &#40;including professional practice&#41; are acts of collaboration
    &#40;i.e. the sharing of knowledge and ideas&#41;. Does the fact that I am financially
    compensated for these efforts make me selfish? Any reasonable person would agree
    that it does not. Hopefully you will too. <BR> <BR>Further, you can&#39;t possibly
    presume to know people&#39;s motivations for submitting later rather than sooner.
    As Jared and Armin have both pointed out, it&#39;s more a function of procrastination
    than anything. To say that 50% of us are weasels is arbitrary and ill-considered.
    <BR> <BR>And rude. <BR> <BR>Like many, it now seems, I submitted my entries in
    the waning days of the entry period not to keep them secret, but because that&#39;s
    when I had time to do so. That&#39;s the whole idea behind a 30-day submission
    window. If anything, the only disrespect is not to the other contestants, but
    to poor Jared and Co. who must format and post the onlsaught of submissions while
    being bombarded with salvos of &#34;where&#39;s my entry?&#34; from all sides.  <BR>
    <BR>So let&#39;s get some perspective, agree that this is a fun contest and that
    we are all thankful for the efforts of the organizers and the contributions of
    the entrants.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;I do agree with
    you &#40;as I seldom do&#41; that there is crisis of professional ethics in this
    country, but that does not mean that the two terms are mutually exclusive, nor
    do I think this contest and the way in which entries were submitted are in any
    way a reflection of the issue.'

    it takes away from any ego-mania and gives chance to those last minute submissions

    SPLIT - simple and clean - to me its a bit to californian but i think its just
    so straight &#40;in a positive way&#41; <BR> <BR>28020 and 28021 ILLUSTRATIVE
    - are nice but to little typophile...maybe <BR> <BR>29030 SWING - the back is
    a bit pathetic like these &#34;no fear&#34; tshirts - sorry. but front i like
    a lot, simple modification but very nice. <BR>29042 LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD - i
    just love the idea of having it in the belly, though it has not so much to do
    with typophile. <BR> <BR>30026 STRANGE GREEN SHAPES ON YELLOW - i just cant get
    ridd of it i love the shapes and the color and the arrangement though i would
    never wear this hardcore-yellow. <BR> <BR>05001 TYPOPHILE DEVIL -  i would like
    it if the back would have nothing on it. too illustrative...devil and then there
    is a devil on it thats too little inbetween happening to me. <BR> <BR>19010 WHITE
    FIRE - i like it. i just think it would have been better if typophile would be
    on the back it seems to me it is a bit unluckily placed. <BR> <BR>13005 LOOK ITS
    A TYPOPHILE - i like it and could imagine i wear it - especially the back is nice.
    makes me smile. <BR> <BR>30033 PINK PRICETAG ON GREEN - i like it technically
    but would never wear it - its clean thats it but that really isit. <BR>

  body: 'I don&#39;t know about everyone else, but for me this whole thing has been
    great fun - submitting a T, seeing what others have come up with, reading the
    comments on everybody&#39;s T including my own, comparing and commenting myself.
    Thanks to Jared and Joseph! <BR> <BR>One of the interesting things to me has been
    the differences not just in taste, but also in what qualities the winner should
    have. I wonder how divided the judges will be! <BR> <BR>My taste is more to the
    classic than the hip. Leaving out my own design, here are some honorable mentions:  <BR>
    <BR>26.02, with the cocktail glass, is the best of the humorous ones.  <BR> <BR>30.70,
    with the quotes that upon a distance read &#39;typophile&#39; is the cleverest
    visual play.     <BR> <BR>7.001 is great as pure typography, but somehow doesn&#39;t
    work as a T.  <BR> <BR>28.030 is the best as far as saying in a phrase and a picture
    what Typophile is about. But somehow the lower case &#39;t&#39; that stars is
    not cute enough. <BR> <BR>2nd runner up: 24.008. &#39;Unique letter chic&#39;
    <BR> <BR>1st runner up: 30.006 the white on black hands making a &#39;T&#39; <BR>
    <BR>And the grand prize winner according to one typophile: <BR> <BR>14.003. The
    White fleuron on red, the minimal &#39;typophile&#39; on back. <BR> <BR>As I said
    when it first appeared, it is simple, beautiful, and simply beautiful.  <BR> <BR>What
    I find fascinating about this one is that the designer didn&#39;t do much; he
    or she just had a sense of the right thing, and supreme confidence to do it.  <BR>
    <BR>&#40;The designer may have drawn the fleuron so that it works on a T, in which
    case more was done that is evident; but it looks effortless.&#41;  <BR> <BR>I
    may wrong on this, but I am guessing that only a designer with very long experience
    would think of and have the confidence to submit something so simple and elegant.  <BR>

    back needs to be cleaned up.&#41; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/16999.html">22.007</a>
    - Anatomy of a foundry type A <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/17024.html">24.004</a>
    - Letraset. This needs to be about 60% of it&#39;s  <BR>current size. <BR> <BR><a
    href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/17024.html">24.012</a> - The

    year too.&#41; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/17463.html">30.059</a>
    - Blackletter &#34;Helvetica.&#34; Love this for its simplicity.  <BR>It&#39;s
    also a play off the old &#34;Helvetica&#34; shirt set in Times. &#40;The  <BR>back
    needs to be simplified.&#41; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/17460.html">29.030</a>
    - Typophile swash. Nicely done, without being overdesigned.

  body: interesting and I agree...when speaking from a business point of view &#40;i.e.
    contests for NGO&#39;s, core, DesignExchange, and experiments&#41;. however previous
    threads encouraged me to think differently about the process when designing to
    promote the industry and especially when the host recipient promotes collaboration
    through its own structure. <BR> <BR>it would be nice to try once at least...surely
    design by committee when the committee is well practiced can&#39;t be all that
    bad. We do it everyday on typophile with our colleagues professional projects
    in any case. I&#39;ve not see a single case here where suggestions from the forums
    damaged the final piece.

    <BR>30.15 - I&#39;d be very happy with this as the winner; <BR>reminds me of something
    from Letterror.  <BR> <BR>30.059 - Helvetica Blackletter &#40;see below&#41; <BR>
    <BR>23.001 - dripping fleuron. The back text needs to be <BR>smaller and different
    tee color, imo. I can see how some <BR>people might be a bit squeamish about this
    one. <BR> <BR><b>PEOPLE

    in detail - A bit too obvious as far as the design goes, but I still like it.
    Colors are unusual/nice also. <BR> <BR>28.023 - typophile metal type/fleuron on
    back - Again, the design is perhaps a little too obvious. I still like it, though.
    Any color but black. Black just feels too... concert shirt-y. <BR> <BR>09.001
    - The Helvetica &amp; Times boxes - Colors are nice, to boot. <BR> <BR>Tim'
