  body: "I might be way off, but if I were to reproduce the Sportage logo from scratch,
    I would probably go with Bank Gothic as my source.\r\n\r\nWhen comes to logo itself
    (not font), you can find the very same logo in vector format and with minor modifications
    achieve the exact result, on brandsoftheworld.com/logo/sportage\r\nand brandsoftheworld.com/search/logo/Cerato
    \r\n\r\nPerhaps someone else will be of more help.\r\n\r\nregards\r\nSeba\r\n\r\n\r\n"
