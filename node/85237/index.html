  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi! I&rsquo;m curious to know which fonts would be the best value for a student who doesn&rsquo;t have a massive budget, but would like to have a good text font for papers that isn&rsquo;t a system default or included with Adobe software. I don&rsquo;t do professional text layout, but I am rather attuned to type, and have been using Garamond Premier Pro for my papers. I&rsquo;m considering buying another one that I&rsquo;ll get a lot of use out of, so I&rsquo;m curious what people here would suggest.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>flooce, I&rsquo;m having a look at some of the suggestions on that other link you have—Leitura is awesome, and I&rsquo;ve been admiring it for a while. I had no idea that the weights were that cheap; I was thinking it would cost more than only ~$29 per weight. And I&rsquo;m quite fond of STF&rsquo;s work—my copy of iWork came with some versions of Stone Sans, and I&rsquo;ve seen Stone Sans/Serif around, and I&rsquo;ve always liked them. :3</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m amazed that Sabon <em>Pro</em> is only $135 for the whole lot, too; I thought it&rsquo;d cost more. I&rsquo;ve used Sabon Std when I interned at a place with an Adobe Font Folio licence, but it wasn&rsquo;t Pro! I may go with Leitura, from what I see, but I&rsquo;m not 100% sure yet. Thanks everyone for the suggestions!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m doing a lot of interdisciplinary/humanities work. I do think that Leitura, on second thought, would look better as a display font, but I really like Mafra from the same foundry. :) I can see why it wouldn&rsquo;t be considered a classic &lsquo;workhorse&rsquo;, though. Mafra appears a bit less affected than Leitura—there&rsquo;s less contrast and I think the colour on the page might look a bit more appropriate.</p>
<p>I also see what you mean about usability, though, although I&rsquo;m not a big fan of Galliard (sorry; I respect the work put into it, but it&rsquo;s not a personal favourite) and I&rsquo;ve been using Adobe Garamond/Garamond Premier Pro for a while, so I wanted to go for something a bit different to those.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;d been considering Starling or&hellip;the other Times-like variants I&rsquo;ve seen around. (I really like the italics in Starling, compared to plain old Times.)</p>

<p>Given that many of your peers will be using plain ol' Times, your papers set in posh Times with proper typography will in comparison be good for another, I dunno, at least half a grade, than they would otherwise merit purely on content.</p>

I think it is a little misleading that FS is offering 8 fonts for $140. It really is only 2 styles, Roman and Italic for $140. All of those fancy things like oldstyle figures and small caps have been broken out as separate fonts. Don&rsquo;t you think that all of that stuff should be in one opentype font? So to me it really is $70 per style. Not that Kent Lew doesn&rsquo;t deserve it. I&rsquo;m just pointing it out.</div>

<p>You&rsquo;re totally right. It does seem a bit misleading to sell them as OpenType fonts if they don&rsquo;t have oldstyle figures and small caps built in as features, as they should be. I&rsquo;m not sure if this was Lew&rsquo;s decision or FontShop&rsquo;s, but I&rsquo;m sure most users would prefer to have fewer, more feature-rich fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@jmontalbano Thanks for pointing that out. I thought that $140 was an incredible deal for 8 fonts, and far less than what I&rsquo;ve seen large families going for. (I&rsquo;ve seen, say, four-font families going for that price, but eight?) Whitman is really nice, but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m currently up to paying $70/style at the moment&ndash;it&rsquo;s just a bit too expensive for me at the moment, but maybe in future! That&rsquo;s really misleading of FontShop to claim that they&rsquo;re full-featured OpenType fonts when they&rsquo;re not, and OpenType is kind of important to me. Not that I need, say, expert figures or more fractions than normal (right now, anyway), but I do like using old-style figures in running text, as well as small caps for headings.</p>
<p>Re the fonts people have linked here&ndash;Freight Text is really nice! A <em>little</em> bit more expensive than what I&rsquo;m looking for (that goes for FontShop&rsquo;s stuff in general, TBH), but really lovely, at the same time. I&rsquo;ve always liked the colouring of Freight when I&rsquo;ve seen it. Milo&rsquo;s really too expensive for me&ndash;lovely, but a bit too steep on my budget. Again, maybe in future! :3 I really like Rongel, as well. It&rsquo;s probably around $50 more than what I&rsquo;d like to spend, but I still rather like it.</p>
<p>Right now, the best deals look like the stuff Adobe have (although my favourites already came with the Adobe software), Sumner Stone&rsquo;s text fonts (probably the best deals of the lot, although I&rsquo;m not certain whether he includes OT features in his families that aren&rsquo;t being distributed by Adobe/ITC) and some of DSType&rsquo;s text fonts. People made good points about Leitura&rsquo;s style (not the best idea for papers), although I really liked Mafra! I definitely don&rsquo;t need massive superfamilies, either&ndash;regular, bold, italic and bold-italic tend to work fine. I really like what everyone&rsquo;s suggested, though, and am going to give it some thought for when I finally decide what to get. :) Style-wise, I prefer old-styles/garaldes, although I can also see the merit in picking transitionals.</p>
<p>Fortunately, none of my current teachers really care if I don&rsquo;t use Times, but I know there are some teachers out there who claim that Times is &lsquo;MLA style&rsquo;&hellip;when the MLA handbook actually doesn&rsquo;t specify a particular typeface. :P</p>

<p>So far, my shortlist is probably Christian Schwartz&rsquo;s Farnham and DSType&rsquo;s Mafra for serifs. :3</p>
<p>I like Athelas, but it&rsquo;s wayyyyy over what I&rsquo;m planning to spend at the moment. Lovely, though, and worth it &ndash; just not now!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite> &gt; I&rsquo;m not sure if this was Lew&rsquo;s decision or FontShop&rsquo;s, but I&rsquo;m sure most users would prefer to have fewer, more feature-rich fonts.</cite></p>
<p>The conversation has moved on, but I thought I’d clarify just for the record.</p>
<p>Yes, Whitman is not the best choice for those on a tight budget. I agree, the way FontShop presents the package is potentially misleading.</p>
<p>Note: it’s not so much that the fonts were “broken out,” as that they’ve never been combined together.</p>
<p>The “8 fonts for $140” is a byproduct of these fonts being almost ten years old. At the time they were released, getting a choice of either OsF or LF as default with the U&amp;lc and getting both versions of the fonts for a single license fee was a big deal. Now, not so much.</p>
<p>The OpenType fonts of Whitman are pretty much just straight conversions of the PostScript fonts. In that respect, they’re akin to the Adobe Std paradigm.</p>
<p>Just because a font is OT format doesn’t mean it will have every bell and whistle. I don’t think that either FontShop or Font Bureau claims that these fonts are “full-featured.”</p>
<p>I will mention, however, that an undocumented aspect of the current Whitman OT fonts is the fact that each variation has both figure sets, both accessible via OT features, but just different defaults. So, if you generally want OsF in text, you can select the OsF font; but then if you need an instance of LF, you can just apply the OT feature, instead of changing to the LF font. And vice versa.</p>
<p>But no, small caps have not been integrated yet. And so are counted as separately priced fonts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not excusing the fact that the fonts are out of date. Just explaining.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite> I wouldn&rsquo;t choose something as quirky as Leitura (which I wouldn&rsquo;t really describe as a workhorse), over classics of usability like Sabon, Galliard, Garamond, etc. But that&rsquo;s just me! </cite></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d actually recommend against choosing Galliard as a workhorse &ndash; while I am quite fond of text set in Galliard Roman, I find that the italic can be quite distracting when used in body text. I do in fact <em> like </em> the italic, I just feel that it draws too much attention to itself for non-display work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@kentlew - Hmm. I&rsquo;m on Font Bureau&rsquo;s site, and the Farnham page isn&rsquo;t suggesting to me that they&rsquo;re selling the OSF and Lining Figures OTFs separately. However, I DID notice that <em>small caps</em> are being sold separately, which is making me reconsider getting Farnham as opposed to something that has a larger set of OpenType variants for a similar price. Lyon Text is looking better to me right now.</p>
<p>@Trevor Baum - Corda is really nice! I think it looks a bit more appropriate for display, though, than what I&rsquo;d be using it for.</p>
<p>@ everyone - as I said to Kent Lew above, I&rsquo;m considering Lyon Text as my final choice. It&rsquo;s only $10 more than what Farnham would cost if I get the regular, italic, bold and bold-italic weights (or variants thereof; I know I want to just start off with four weights), and it includes small caps, old-style figures and tabular figures inside the same files, which is a much better deal for me than getting them separately. (Not that the other choices aren&rsquo;t worth it; they&rsquo;re fantastic&ndash;this just looks like the best option for me at the moment.) What I really like about Lyon is its colouring, at least onscreen.</p>
