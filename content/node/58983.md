  two engraving proofing presses previously written about (here) are going up to Alexandria,
  LA for a beauty makeover.\r\n\r\nWhile John (hubby) and Ken (friend) work on the
  presses tomorrow in Ken's shop, I will be going back over to James Gabour's printing
  facility in Pineville.  Meeting us there will be the new archivist from the LSU
  AgCenter in Alexandria.\r\n\r\nJames senior may have to close the plant and\u2014
  as much as possible\u2014I (we) want to help preserve the contents and printing
  history in his shop.\r\n\r\nThe AgCenter can only take records (paper), no ephemera,
  no equipment and there is plenty of everything.  Loyola University New Orleans graphic
  design department is interested in taking some, VERNA, a local letter press shop
  \ will probably take the letter press equipment and types, there loads of wood type
  as well.  Jeff Pulaski, graphic design professor up in Witchita, may also help with
  the dispensation of the rest.  Here are links to the good folk who are helping:\r\n\r\nhttp://cmfa.loyno.edu/faculty/daniela-marx\r\nhttp://www.1dayofart.com/content/tag/daniela-marx/\r\nhttp://vernapress.com/peter.html\r\nhttp://www.outofsortspress.com\r\nhttp://nancysharoncollinsstationer.wordpress.com/\r\n"
