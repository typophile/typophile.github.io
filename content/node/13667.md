body: "Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, wherever you all may be!\r\n\r\nI
  need to modify typed used in a logo in order to optimise it for use at a small size
  - say printed as four lines of 18pt, tightly kerned and leaded, with no unusual
  printed applications. \r\n\r\nthe obvious thing would be to open up the letterspacing
  and leading a wee bit. I'm thinking I might need to shave crotches a bit too. I
  don't have a great deal of experience in the more functional aspects of drawing
  type (may i burn in hell), so any comments would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nLuke\r\n"

  body: Luke, could you post a couple of letters or the whole logo? It helps visual
    people to have visual examples. Also how are you going to use the type at the
    smaller size? On the web or some sort of printing.
