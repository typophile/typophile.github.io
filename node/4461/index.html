		<div class="commentbody">Jack, <BR> <BR>If this is your first attempt, I'd say you have an excellent specimen. I especially enjoy the small nuances like the lowercase &quot;l&quot; and the &quot;a&quot;. The lowercase and smallcap &quot;z&quot;, however, seem out of place, probably due to the rounded angles. (I recognize the constraints you face when you get that small.) <BR> <BR>What can you share about your design process? Did you build it directly in a bitmap editor or did you draw it pixel-for-pixel in Photoshop? <BR> <BR>jb</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mmm, you know, you're probably right about the Z's&hellip; I thought they seemed a little &quot;off&quot; while I was making them but I didn't think of any other way they could look. <BR> <BR>First step in the design process was Photoshop at 1600% zoom with a one-pixel pencil/eraser, for quick experimentation and such. Then in Fontographer I used the rectangle tool in conjunction with snap-to-grid to recreate the shapes as outlines. <BR> <BR>Designing this font, I am constantly beset with fear that I'm unwittingly plagiarizing other people's work, but I suppose when one is designing a five-pixel high &quot;E&quot; there are only so many possibilities available. The one character I'm fairly sure is unique is the lowercase Y; but maybe I just haven't done enough reading&hellip; <BR> <BR>And yes, this is the first &quot;draft&quot; of the typeface.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You've nailed the small caps in relation to the the U&amp;lc. Many fonts out there use a 'unicase' approach for variety (including one of my own), whereas you've created something much richer. <BR> <BR>I wouldn't be concerned about the &quot;embarrassment of riches&quot; in terms the number of bitmap faces out there. The majority of them could only be called alphabets&ndash;with no attempt at serious punctuation, let alone international characters. Kudos for that. <BR> <BR>//joe</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Really nice work! <BR>I'd like to see how this would look as a normal face (full size scaleable). It sure looks handsome.  <BR> <BR>There was mentioned the smallcaps and lowercase 'z' falling out in relation to the rest of the typeface, I have the same feeling towards the smallcaps and lowercase 'x'. When looking at the 'x' it seems too wide. <BR> <BR>It is by far a richer 8-bit character set i've seen and looks promising. <BR> <BR>(By the way..im new here and will watch out this space as I'm working on several character sets myself and would like some constructive and qualified critique when I feel the time is right for it.) <BR> <BR>Good luck!!! <BR> <BR>Yours, <BR>Sbo</div>

		<div class="commentbody">font looks great. i like the descending numerals. i would have to agree that the lc 'x' looks too wide. it is also too bright compared to the other characters. a problem easily remedied by mixing some of the diagonal with a verticle pixel or two or three or four.</div>
