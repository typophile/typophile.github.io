  body: "Looks nice. Some suggestions would be to shorten the descender strokes on
    the g's. Thin the connecting stroke from the i to n and also try to put more slant
    on the bowls of your g's so the match the italic pitch of the n.\r\n\r\nOther
    than that it looks very nice :)"

  body: 'I would try to swap the two "g" one in the place of the other, because of
    that "swirl" of the first one (just a suggestion to try something different, i
    don''t know how it will look like), shorthen the descenders and make the overall
    logo a liiiittle less bold: when set in white it looks too bold to me...'

  body: Here is the latest version. The client liked the first one but wanted to take
    a much more modern approach.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logotype-2-choices_6399.jpg]

  body: "When I think of ginger, I think it's pretty organic--not in the fluid art
    nouveau line sense, but it does grow in a way that doesn't remind me of the latest
    stuff.\r\n\r\nIt's also textured and bumpy, and has rings along its root sort
    of like a bamboo stalk does.\r\n\r\nEither way the client wants what they want--but
    I can imagine modern simplistic still being organic, instead of  almost so industrial
    as to use the square as you have in the latest example...which is why I think
    the leaf seems like so much of an after thought (its forms don't at all correspond
    to the letters')."

  body: the latest version the leaf looks more like a flame. Also the type choice
    doesn't feel very welcoming...especially for a restaurant...too rigid. The original
    concept was much better.

  body: "i think your original concept felt much more modern as well as more playful
    and inviting.\r\njust needed a couple small touch-ups."

  body: Agree with Evan, the latest logo looks way more dated than the first one.
    This could evoke industrially mass produced ginger juice, or anything else. It
    gives me a cold "synthetic" feeling. Sorry to say, but for me it really lacks
    personality...or maybe it's just the client's taste.

  body: Agreed. Was really digging the first version. The second has the feeling of
    a bottle of herbal tea. But, the client is the client. I would try and warm it
    up a bit, seems a bit cold at the moment.
