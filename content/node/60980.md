  me. \r\n\r\np.s. I am looking for a typeface for body text, not headlines...\r\n\r\nThanks!x"

    If you have access to the Frutiger monograph (\"Complete Works\"), there's some

    issue.\r\nIn the early days of DTP, I would stretch Adobe Garamond to 150% in
    Quark (for text), and it looked great. Really!\r\nDiagonals are the sticking point,
    so square faces without diagonals may be compressed lots without apparent distortion.\r\nBut
    no, I haven't designed any faces with squooshability as a parameter."

  body: "I bet it was fun. Doesn't look half as bad as I pictured, and not nearly
    as bad as <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/60755\">this</a>. You may be right
    that stretching horizontally is less detrimental than condensing \u2013 at least
    the contrast pattern stays comparably comfortable. The variance in stretch maybe
    seems almost more disturbing than the stretch itself (like comparing the two bottom
    lines \u2013 \"biologically\" seems a lot more \"normal\" than \"determinations\"
    no?).\r\nI think it also looks \"good\"/\"fun\" in a very 1989 sort of way. Dunno
    \u2013 looking at that headline (and those O l i g o n u c l e o t i d e s ! )
    today, and as a type designer, would you still do that?"

    I was using the variety of stretching to \"massage\" text blocks to fit the layout,
    and the variety of stretching, and type styles, served to disguise that \"cheating\".\r\nFor
    instance, the really wide drop cap was done to optimize the justification of the
    first paragraph.\r\nAnd the three squared-off items were stretched to fit the
    space they're in, with nice margins.\r\n\r\n<em>...in a very 1989 sort of way...</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    it was supposed to look new, advertising a new piece of scientific equipment,
    and stretched type signified new at the time, the DTP meme. Also the spectroscope
    itself was long."

    big samples in the right column.\r\nAlthough I now see that Sumner Stone himself
    seems to endorse slanting, it still looks like a mere makeshift to me: Silica
    might withstand the slanting better than other faces do, but some characterforms
    (especially \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018g\u2019) do suffer. Also, it seems to affect
    the otherwise balanced spacing.\r\n\r\nThe slant factor in the specimen seems
    to be ~10\xB0, with additional condensing (~92%). Stone has also recommended pairing
    Silica with the Italics of his Magma.\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/silica_5745.png]"

  body: As I remember, Unger's Gulliver was designed specifically for USA Today and
    he knew, in advance, that they would be doing all sorts of things to it. Of course,
    I don't think it is available for purchase anywhere. Swift looks like a decent
    substitute.

    the fact that it doesn't seem to hurt them as much as one may think.\r\n\r\nBTW,

    how much they did it and how well it stands up." (I've probably paraphrased a
    little bit.)
