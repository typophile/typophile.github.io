  body: I believe this is custom for Trader Joes. Don't they also do a lot of handlettering
    in their stores? Another reason to think this may be custom or handlettered.

  body: "I doubt it's hand drawn.  As is the case with other faux hand scripts as
    well as so-called \"grunge\" faces the quickest way to determine whether anyone
    put any personal stamp on it is to compare the same characters throughout. The
    \"t\"s. \"e\"s and \"l\"s are identical.\r\n\r\nDoes your client send you e-mails
    entirely in comic sans?\r\n\r\nhttp://typographyshop.com\r\nhttp://kinggroupmedia.com"

    fette fraktur and hobo. But hey, I mean, who doesn't?!?\r\n\r\nAnyhooo their product
    is a kids toy, so the font actually works ok."
