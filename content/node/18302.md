body: "Hi everyone.\r\n\r\nI've been looking for this font for a while now. I've tried
  WhatTheFont.com's services as well as Identifont but obviously without any luck.\r\n\r\nSo
  far I've found some similar ones like Alien League, Steelfish, Univers Condensed
  etc. However, as close as they may seem, none of them are the exact font. The reason
  I know is because the '3' has a straight line (as you can see in the photo) and
  all these other fonts have the double curves.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\nThank
  you!"

  body: I have a sneaking suspicion that it <em>is</em> Univers Condensed (either
    57 or 59) with some handwork done. What suggests this possibility to me is the
    A without the crossbar; the slash O with the slash going in the wrong direction;
    and the 3, which is really a 5, slightly modified (actually, it's a combination
    of a 5 and a 7).
