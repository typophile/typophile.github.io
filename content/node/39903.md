  point in learning about kerning pairs, hinting\u2026etc until I have some letterforms
  I\u2019m actually satisfied with. After playing around with the enclosed for ages,
  I feel like I am going round in circles. The idea was to do a sans with roman proportions
  and I started out doing a skeleton using Sabon, then thickened everything in Freehand
  and re-did the branch connections/line intersections and tried to optically compensate
  all the horizontal bits. Basically I\u2019m not completely happy with the letters
  and not sure they work together properly, but can\u2019t quite figure out why. Any
  suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  "

    In the PDF are we looking at default sidebearings, or has everything been tracked
    out? It's hard to say much about how it perfoms without seeing text settings.
    \r\n\r\nProportions look good. Notes:\r\n\r\na -- bowl shape lacks definition
    and rigor.\r\n\r\ne -- could be a tad wider. That's a personal taste thing. Some
    people prefer the e narrowish in a roman set like this.\r\n\r\ng -- could be wider.
    Top bowl by 15%, bottom bowl by 20 - 30%\r\n\r\ni & j -- dots can be that big
    if you want and will give good performance at 8pts or smaller. At larger sizes
    some people may be alarmed by them. Left side bearing on j too wide.\r\n\r\nG
    -- align crossbar with E, F, H midline?\r\n\r\nH, N, U -- in both even width caps
    and proportional caps, H often turns out to be the measure of all things. I base
    the width of N and U on H. *Base* them on H, as making them the same won't neccessarily
    work. If you make H about 10% wider, N could then be narrowed by approximately
    the same amount, then widen U to suit.\r\n\r\nR -- consider moving top of leg
    back to harmonize with angles on K, N, X\r\n\r\nr -- arm lacks definition.\r\n\r\nS
    -- curves letting the team down a bit. Adjust spine angle and reshape curves to
    match P, B etc. If you change S you might change s to match, since that kind of
    thing is such a contemporary preoccupation.\r\n\r\nV -- a bit narrow by prevailing
    standards.\r\n\r\nOverall it's sweet but undistinguished. There are dozens of
    competitors out there just like it. Were it to be released as is (with spec corrections)
    most font buyers will fail to see the point.\r\n\r\nBut keep going. \r\n\r\nj

    stage of trying to learn how to draw letters so I can guarantee I won\u2019t be
    releasing any typefaces anytime soon. I do have to start somewhere, though. Will
    now go back to my cave and try some of your adjustments. Thanks again, Simon H. "

  body: "Great.  I experienced the same thing when I first started making fonts. Ganymede
    was drawn three times over, and I still wasn't happy with it.\r\n\r\nIt's a process
    of first learning how to draw letters, then drawing them enough times until you've
    got stylistic range and you're confidant with genres. The only way to attain that
    confidence is to draw some fonts, so it involves making a few early ones you will
    probably always look back on as learning material. But as you say, you have to
    start somewhere, and you've made that start.\r\n\r\nOnce you start it can be just
    as tough walking away from a font you're certain is far from finished, even if
    you're sick of working on it. So, if it really gets to you, have no qualms about
    putting this one away for a while and starting another one, because once you've
    got some experience a fresh start is always good.\r\n\r\nI think what you've got
    here is very nicely conceived (Sabon is a good starting point for a sans); it
    needs refinement and more specific shapes for the bowl letters to give it a true
    voice. It's good in a way that you've kept it neutral to begin with. There are
    many directions it could go in from here. Would you like styling suggestions?\r\n\r\nj

    with graphic design you only really know what words and text blocks look like
    and don\u2019t actually \u2018see\u2019 the individual letters. I\u2019m also
    not used to concentrating on 1 thing for long periods of time but wouldn\u2019t
    say I\u2019m sick of yet \u2013 think you just lose objectivity after a while.
    I do have a couple of other unfinished typeface attempts so am going to make an
    effort to beat this one into shape. \r\n\r\n\u201CThere are many directions it

  body: "Start by defining exactly the genre of type you aim to make. Some well-known
    plots this font could easily turn into:\r\n\r\n1) pen-influenced,\r\n2) neutral
    sans, \r\n3) geometric sans\r\n4) stressed linear, \r\n5) \"high-concept\" high-definition
    stressed linear, \r\n6) blackletter-influenced,\r\n7) \"gothic\" sans eg: URW++,
    Brown,  \r\n8) serifless Sabon, with or without stressing\r\n9) Gill-esque humanist\r\n10)
    Koch-esque\r\n\r\n11) something else.\r\n\r\nLowercase <strong>a</strong> is obviously
    a key genre-setting device, as vigorously-discussed elsewhere. Look at a dozen
    or so premium sans serif fonts in the genre you like and pick an <strong>a</strong>
    bowl design that appeals to you. Have a good close up look at its construction.\r\n\r\nThis
    <strong>a</strong> I drew over a year ago:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/parlance_a_6140.gif]\r\n\r\nRigor
    depicted by way of an exaggerated plot and shape contrast. I was aiming for a
    high tension effect---toyght like a toyger! You may not need that much tension
    but you can apply the spirit of it to your moxie-starved <strong>a</strong>. Keep
    your bowl size and proportions, but---\"jarr\" the lines by way of exaggeration.\r\n\r\nYou
    probably need to add more nodes to make a \"bespoke\" bowl shape.\r\n\r\nj a m

  body: "Hi James, I\u2019d originally got the idea from admiring a book done completely
    in Syntax (\u2018Rencontres Typographiques\u2019 by Roger Ch\xE2telain) which
    I guess is \u2018pen-influenced\u2019, along with lapidary writing. Think mine
    has ended up as \u2018neutral\u2019 without my consciously deciding \u2013 possibly
    because my last attempt was an Akzidenz rip-off. I had thought about removing
    the remaining Roman references but will have a go at re-drawing them instead.
    Will hopefully report back at some point next year if I manage to get anywhere
    \u2013 cheers again for the comments, this has been a huge help. "

  body: "You're in the right ball park for a Syntax-like humanist sans, and yes at
    this stage it is veering into neutral territory.\r\n\r\nSome directions you could
    go in from here:\r\n* keep the remaining Roman/roman references and add more cues
    from 16th century Italian designs like Jenson and Griffo, to give it a stronger
    humanist resonance than Syntax.\r\n\r\n* If that works out the design could be
    further differentiated by adding more definition to the outlines. You might end
    up with an exaggerated humanist type. I'm picturing something related to Frantisek
    Storm's Sebastian, one of the few examples of a \"high-concept, high-definition
    stressed linear\", but different again.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    somehow. \r\n\r\nI think the g is the weakest point. Optically is is way heavier
    than the letters around it. It isn't a part of the group.\r\n\r\nRather than pounding
    out all 26 letters again I would get a core set together maybe 'aoiehns' or something
    similar & really get what you are after settled in a deeper way. Otherwise the
    thing becomes too labour intensive to let yourself do the right things - and by
    this I mean being relentless and not settling for second best. Then you can swing
    back through and have some good fun with the g and fight your way through the
    diagonal shapes knowing that at least the core latin shapes are solid. \r\n\r\nAnd
    then you can question it all over again. ;-)\r\n\r\n"
