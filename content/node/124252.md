body: "typogrid is a smart tool for typographers and graphic designers helps them
  to create typography letters and pixel arts based on the grids system.\r\n\r\nIn
  2011, I developed the first version of this web application under \"Square Kufi
  / Kufi Murabba\" name. The concept of the app was to help users create one kind
  of arabic calligraphy which is Square Kufi using pen and eraser tools.\r\n\r\nAt
  the end of 2014, and after feedback and further development of my vision, I developed
  a lot of concepts to created an advanced and smart tool for typographers and graphic
  designers which would help them to create typography letters and pixel arts based
  on the grids system, in a much more faster way. Thus, this web application has now
  emerged as something more than a tool to create Kufi arabic calligraphy - it has
  become a TypoGrid.\r\n\r\nTechnical Features:\r\n- User-friendly interface\r\n-
  Export as SVG and PNG\r\n- Import SVG files\r\n- Compatible on iPad, Tablets and
  smart phones\r\n\r\nhttp://qcalligraphy.com/typogrid1.0/\r\n\r\nhttp://player.vimeo.com/video/121028665\r\nhttp://player.vimeo.com/video/121029805\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/small_typogrid_01_6299.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I wanted to check it out, perhaps compare it to inkpad app for the ipad which
    is fantastic for vector drawing (except when you type Arabic in it the marks positions
    adjustments are misplaced - high instead of low and vice versa). Judqing from
    the movie your app can 'store' shapes - great. The App Store in Japan does not
    have it either for desktop or ipad...\r\nGood luck!\r\n"

    the fact that vertical strokes look thinner than horizontal ones (when they're
    mathematically equal)?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
