  McCartney's</a> new album employs an ambigram in a kind of uncial way, unfortunately
  not really working.\r\n\r\nbtw if you want a very simple one for yourself try <a

  body: "The Ambigrammatic is interesting. Looks like they devised a single letter
    ambigram form for every pair of letters in the alphabet (including the same letter),
    then the program looks at the string(s) you provide and looks up the corresponding
    ambigram form for each pair of letters (right-side-up and up-side-down) and displays
    the ambigram. Crude, but effective in a rather mechanical way. Not all of the
    forms work real well.\r\n\r\nI just designed <a href=\"http://www.marksimonson.com/images/revelation-big.gif\">an
    ambigram for a client</a> who is going to use it for a tattoo. They're not easy,
    but can be fun (ambigrams, I mean).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.johnlangdon.net/\">John
    Langdon</a> is the master of this particular art form."

  body: "That is good work your RN pair is particularly nice. I recently did one for
    a tattoo too (added to the original post). Clients can be fun too (and not easy:).
    The work involved in working out even crude letter pairs must be enormous.\r\nTim"

  body: "My view is that the problems are with the rotation point (the two c's) and
    the crossbar of the A/M and the way the y/P is formed, there are opportunities
    for improvement on the r. I feel that overall it needs more work on it to be effective.
    Also there is a missed opportunity (or built in redundancy) in the treatment of
    the title, in that it does nothing to support the rotational/reflective aspect
    of the ambigram.\r\nTim"

  body: "<em>our RN pair is particularly nice</em>\r\n\r\nThanks. That was actually
    the part that came easiest for some reason. The rest, particularly the t, was
    trickier.\r\n\r\nI agree with you about the McCartney solution. It feels weak,
    like they went so far and gave up. I don't know that I could have done better
    (having not attempted it), but it does seem like it could be better. Anybody know
    who did it?"

    I was also contacted off-thread but was unable to solve that one so elegantly.
    (assuming that was for the same person ;) ) Excellent work!\r\n\r\nMark, three
    letters, w-o-w, on the Revelation.\r\n\r\nHere are <a href=\"http://www.agency26.com/ambi.jpg\">a
    few recent ambigrams</a>; the first two were going to be tattoos, but don't know
    whether the inkwork has been started.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.agency26.com/heart.jpg\">further

  body: "bj,\r\nThat is an impressive use of lettering styles, was that part of the
    briefs or your reaction to the problem?\r\nI guess that it was the same person
    and it did take rather longer than I thought (I started with a flowing script
    but had to abandon that). It is quite a responsibility designing something as
    permanent as a tattoo, ultimately I took the opinion that the client's know their
    minds and own their bodies.\r\nTim"

  body: "Hey Tim, thx. I emailed you, btw. \r\n> was that part of the briefs or your
    reaction to the problem?\r\n\r\n I'd say 'reaction to problem' or 'reaction to
    puzzle'. More often than not, clients need to be  gently educated on the benefits
    of a custom mark vs. something done in a font. So if a brief exists, hopefully
    for us, it's a broad call to solve the puzzle with a custom lettering solution.\r\n
    \  Thus, the lettering journey \u2014 from sketchbook musings, to illustrator
    doodles, to pleasing the client with a final piece \u2014 becomes an invigorating
    exercise in problem solving. It doesn't always happen like that, but we can dream,
    eh? (sorry, I know this is preaching to the choir.) :D\r\n"
