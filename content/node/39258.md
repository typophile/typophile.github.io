body: "I noticed some time ago that certain words in submitted posts get changed (asterixes
  for characters, how strange). Maybe it's a good idea to do the same with the word
  'free' (as in 'freeware fonts')? Seeing there are a lot of requests for fr** versions
  of certain typefaces popping up lately\u2026"

    (recently somebody did). Everybody would understand what I mean. More effective
    would be to hide the names of every known commercial typeface."

  body: So are we to just stand by and not try? It seems to me that education is the
    only way to make it work. Sure, it doesn't always work, but that doesn't mean
    we should stop trying.
