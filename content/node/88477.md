  body: "I would like to formally introduce myself and DigitaLingo to the Typophile
    community.  My name is Frank Martinez and I am the founder of The Martinez Group
    PLLC.  I recently formed and launched DigitaLingo.com, as a service and website
    devoted to assisting small and medium sized foundries with complex licensing matters.
    In apologize for the length of this post. However, in view of the comments thus
    far, an explanation is warranted.\r\n  \r\nFor the past 30 years I have been active
    in design and typography, the last 15 years of which as a patent examiner and
    attorney specializing in the licensing and protection of font software and works
    of design.   DigitaLingo was born out of those experiences, but it is not an attorney
    or lawyer service.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, DigitaLingo is algorithmically based
    and was created to optimize the licensing value of font software in OEM and large
    licensing inquiries. We have surveyed the licensing models in use by most of the
    foundries and, using over 40,000 data points; have modeled an optimized pricing
    model that is based upon 6 algorithms.  These algorithms were modeled to incorporate,
    (i) the foundry value assigned to a font, (ii) the market value for the type of
    font, (iii) the market value for the overall type of use desired by a licensing
    party/licensee, and (iv) the additional uses (outside of the customary desktop
    uses)  that are to be licensed.  Once initiated, the DigitaLingo process will
    automatically value the font software and populate a licensing document with the
    party names and addresses, identify the fonts, the licensed uses, any restrictions
    and will then transmit a draft licensing document to the parties for review and
    signature, all \u201Con the fly\u201D and on the cloud.\r\n\r\nThe documents are
    stored on the cloud and are retrievable by the foundry at any time.  In addition
    and if desired, negotiations, if any, can be conducted via the DigitaLingo platform,
    providing a single site for preserving the history of a licensing deal.  As can
    be expected, a foundry is free to alter the terms or the prices as they may desire
    once the documents are transmitted for review. However, our testing and the \u201Cstealth
    mode\u201D use of the pricing models indicate that they can be very accurate in
    optimizing valuation for the foundry.\r\n\r\nIn developing the pricing model our
    goal was find a model which accurately captures, for foundries, the value of font
    software in the plethora of modern uses in existence, while being responsive to
    what the market (users/purchasers of licenses) will pay for fonts in such licensing
    arrangements.  The desktop model is, in my opinion, grossly unsuited to accurately
    capture the value of font software as it can be used in the digital world.  I
    have referred to the additional value of fonts in the digital world as the \u201Creflective
    value\u201D created by fonts; that is, the additional value that fonts create
    when used in OEM and digital, commercial, entertainment and other value creating
    ways. DigitaLingo was created to capture that additional value for the foundry.\r\n\r\nMost
    OEM and large corporate font inquires are negotiated by experience corporate representatives
    whose unsurprising goal is to maximize the value of a font license purchase for
    the licensee.  Most small and medium sized foundries do not have access to the
    same set of negotiating tools and market information that a large licensing party
    has at their fingertips.  Because of our experience in licensing, negotiating
    and litigating font software infringements, we do.  More importantly, DigitaLingo
    is our effort to distill that experience into a set of tools that any foundry
    can use.  If a foundry so desires, we can represent them in the negotiations,
    not as lawyers, but as a business and font advocate.  We are currently working
    on tuning the algorithms and as the data set grows, the algorithms will be tuned
    further.  In addition, we are currently developing a suite of automated font software
    copyright filing tools to assist the font community in protecting their work.
    \ It\u2019s a process and any comments and/or suggestions from Typophile members
    and others in the design and font communities will be welcome. \r\n"

  body: "Two issues.  First, DigitaLingo is about the mathematics of license valuation
    based upon the value a font creates in its various uses and the value that the
    font purchasing market will pay for font software. DTF's comments illustrate the
    reasons why font designers struggle to make a living and/or to get the proper
    value for their work.  DigitaLingo is not merely a lawyer using old documents.
    The next time you fly, ask yourself why does the ticket cost more when you fly
    on a Friday and return on a Monday or when you fly on a holiday.  It's a simple
    thought experiment, but highly illustrative.  It's the valuation being responsive
    to demand.  DigitaLingo creates a mechanism to capture that value for foundries.
    I have a BFA from Pratt Institute, I worked at Landor Associates and The Schecter
    Group as a production director, where among other duties, I set up kerning tables
    and purchased font licenses for use with client projects.  For the past 13 years
    I have taught Intellectual Property Law in the MFA Design Program at SVA in New
    York where I advocate for an understanding of good typography and licensing.  I
    am not unaware of the issues that confront designers and typographers.  Fonts
    have an intrinsic value that exceeds their use on the desktop.  The web isn't
    static why should font valuation be stuck in the 19th Century?  \r\n\r\nSecond,
    the empty workstation - I sit in that chair about 60-80 hours per week, sometimes
    more.   I'll post a regular picture if it will make all of you feel better."

  body: "These are some cogent questions.  Regarding antitrust, it is not our intent
    to dictate or control pricing. Which is why we generate a draft document for review
    by the foundry.  They are free to change the pricing, the algorithms provide a
    \"market pricing band\". To be fair, the pricing band is pretty accurate, but
    we are not the font police, the foundry is always in control.  Issues with the
    Unfair Competition and Anti-Trust folks at the Federal Trade Commission would
    only arise if we had the power to dictate pricing across the font industry or
    if every foundry in the USA elected to use the DigitaLingo pricing structure in
    lockstep.\r\n\r\nDTF raises a good point regarding accuracy over time.  Algorithmic
    based valuation is by its very nature a constant process.  It has to be reviewed
    constantly because markets change.  However, as the data set gets larger, it is
    possible to becomes more accurate and to better predict pricing and usage trends.
    In order to keep DigitaLingo accurate, we will have to constantly review pricing,
    licensing patterns and types of uses patterns as well as other factors, so as
    to provide more accurate market pricing for foundries.\r\n\r\nRegarding  aesthetics,
    We apply \"multipliers\" or factors that are responsive to intended uses by the
    licensee.  It is my contention that aesthetic decisions and licensee responses
    to aesthetic considerations are reflected (incorporated) in sales volumes and
    \"types of uses\" history for a font. Technically, it is possible to add a modifier
    or \"factor\" that reflects aesthetic considerations into our set of pricing algorithms.
    However, the questions arises - Who's aesthetic sensibility do we use as the model
    for the factors? I stand by the term accurate since I was merely referring to
    observable numerical sets.  \r\n\r\nNick: thank you for the note, I shall be less
    \"sensitive\" in the future."

  body: "Frank I am curious \u2014\r\n\r\n1) Where do you get your \u201C40,000 data
    points\u201D about pricing? If the answer is from your work on past font licenses,
    how can Digital Lingo's customers be sure that those data points are not protected
    by attorney-client privilege, contractual nondisclosure, etc.?\r\n\r\n2) DL says
    it offers access to \u201Csophisticated and experienced business and legal professionals\u201D
    yet elsewhere says that it \u201Cdoes not offer legal services or legal advice.\u201D
    Assuming for the sake of argument that those statements can peacefully coexist,
    who ultimately bears responsibility for the quality of a DL license? DL, or its
    customers?\r\n\r\n3) How does DL plan to detect and resolve conflicts of interest?
    One could imagine a scenario where an OEM licensor is seeking bids from two (or
    more) foundries. Both foundries, unbeknownst to each other, sign up with DL to
    assist. The foundries are adverse to the licensor, but they are also adverse to
    each other, since if one gets the license, the other will not. \r\n\r\n4) Since
    you are the \u201Cman behind the curtain\u201D in either case, how does a foundry
    benefit by using DL instead of just hiring you directly?"

  body: "Matthew:\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to post your comments. \r\n\r\n1.\tThe
    40,000 data points are derived from publicly available information and the process
    associated with deriving a valuation is proprietary.\r\n\r\n2.\tYou are well aware
    that \u201Caccess to experienced assistance\u201D does not comprise an attorney
    client relationship.  The second part of your question implies that the DL licensing
    document is a document provided under an attorney client relationship. The \u201Cstandard\u201D
    DL license document is derived from over a decade of experience preparing such
    documents and is intended to provide a sound basis for a licensing relationship
    between the foundry and its client, it is not an attorney negotiated document
    and the DL client is free to amend or alter as they may desire.  If a licensing
    request is extraordinarily complex or burdensome, and upon the specific request
    of the DL client, the matter could be referred to an attorney for individuated
    evaluation, preparation and negotiation. If no such request arises, the document
    is automatically prepared according the DL user\u2019s input and delivered.\r\n\r\nCurrently,
    foundries choose to be responsible for the quality of their own documents. Many
    of them are self-created, some professionally drafted and they exhibit significant
    differences in form and efficacy.  We have some experience in these matters and
    we are confident in the quality of the basic DL license.  \r\n \r\n3.\tThe DL
    algorithmic pricing evaluations are based upon a DL client\u2019s pricing disclosures.
    They are not pooled with other client\u2019s prices nor are they compared with
    another foundry\u2019s pricing. A DL client\u2019s prices are not made available
    to other DL users.  We are well aware that potential OEM licensees will shop for
    bids and they frequently disclose to a potential licensor-foundry the prices they
    receive from other foundries to drive down prices.  DL does not participate in
    or enable that practice since it distorts valuation. Notwithstanding, the decision
    to license and the ultimate price a DL client accepts is always in the control
    of the DL user.  The DL user may or may not vary from the derived price, either
    as they are so inclined. \r\n\r\n4.\t The corollary to being the \u201Cman behind
    the curtain\u201D should the exhortation to \u201Cignore that man behind the curtain.\u201D
    DL is an attempt to provide an easy to use set of tools that give small and medium
    sized foundries access to knowledge that may be too expensive to access and implement
    under normal circumstances.  As noted above, if the licensing inquiry is complex
    or very extensive, it may be appropriate for the DL client to seek professional
    assistance. Admittedly, my law firm is experienced in and available for such tasks,
    but other professionals are also available. The DL user is free to use the advisor
    of their choosing.\r\n\r\nFinally as a general statement many of your questions
    spring from concerns relating to attorney ethics regulations. The concerns you
    have voiced are genuine, but absent specific facts, hypothetical examples become
    an exercise in legal or academic metaphysics. DL is not an attorney service, it
    may draw upon experience associated with a legal practice, but that does not mean
    it is the practice of law. Extending your reasoning and without umbrage, one might
    inquire as to whether an attorney client relationship exists simply because one
    purchased a copy of \"Typography of Lawyers\".  In addition, who would be responsible
    if a court or administrative agency misinterprets a document by reason of the
    formatting and type usage advice of the lawyer-typographer-author? Absent specific
    facts, who knows?\r\n"
