		<div class="commentbody">Vendetta. Brothers. Manson. What is this, an Emigre promo?  ;-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think incorporating &quot;Manson&quot; would be great if the target clientele is &quot;edgy&quot; (like Chase says). The fact that your surname is indeed Manson means nobody can hold any allusions to criminality against you (at least not formally). And when somebody asks you if Charles's reputation had anything to do with your choice of name, you can tailor your answer depending on what kind of person is asking! It can help you create an atmosphere, an illusion, based on the needs at hand. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Visually: I would try some kind of Yin/Yang opposition/unity thing (but not too literal a reference to the Yin/Yang symbol itself). Here's one of my most favorite logos (by Gahlord Dewald): <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.thtfct.com/">http://www.thtfct.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, note that &quot;Manson&quot; is &quot;man&quot;+&quot;son&quot;; maybe you can play the sibling aspect into that.
