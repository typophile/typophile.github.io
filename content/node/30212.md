  \r\n\r\n<CITE>Frank Stanton, a broadcasting pioneer and CBS president for 26 years
  who helped turn its TV operation into the \"Tiffany network\" and built CBS News
  into a respected information source, has died. He was 98.\r\n\r\n. . . \r\n\r\nDespite
  the evanescent world of broadcasting to which he devoted his life, one of Stanton's
  proudest achievements was the stone-and-mortar edifice of CBS' mid-Manhattan headquarters,
  completed in 1964 at a cost of $40 million. He guided its design from the stone
  that inspired its \"Black Rock\" nickname to the <strong>typography of the elevator
  numerals.</strong></CITE>"
