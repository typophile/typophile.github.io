body: "The Elston Press is noted by one author, at least, as being the most important
  of New York's private presses.\r\n\r\nWhen I stumbled onto one of their books on
  Google Books, I immediately noticed the strong resemblance to the books of William
  Morris:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elston_4501.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut on
  a [[http://www.elstonpress.com/PrivatePressTypes.html|web page]] about that press,
  to which I went in order to find information about the types used by that press,
  I found that they apparently made do with what they could get from ordinary sources,
  particularly ATF.\r\n\r\nInitially, searching for the source of one typeface with
  an unfamiliar name led me to Lanston Monotype, but in fact the face originated at
  Barnhart Brothers & Spindler, and continued its existence at ATF, being licensed,
  like Century Expanded, to Lanston.\r\n\r\nBut while the web page referenced above
  indicates that the sample from an Elston Press publication is likely to be in Caslon
  Old Roman, and an enlarged image on a [[http://www.galleyrack.com/images/artifice/letters/press/comptype/monotype/typography/composite-specimen/|web
  site about Lanston Monotype]] seemed to confirm that,  looking in specimen books
  for Barnhart\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coroman_bbs_5275.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
  for Lanston Monotype\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coroman_lmo_5972.jpg]\r\n\r\ninstead
  gave the impression of a dated type not close enough to either the original Jenson
  or to a modification in the spirit of Morris' Golden Type to produce the attractive
  kind of private press book that Elston produced.\r\n\r\nOf course, there could be
  more than one typeface under the name of Caslon Old Roman. (It was originally called
  just Old Roman, but a more condensed face was under that name in the BB&S specimen
  book I looked at.)\r\n\r\nOr it could just be subjectivity distorting my perceptions.
  The same BB&S book gave extended body copy samples of Fifteenth Century, which looked
  far less bad than I would have expected (another name for that reprobate, Caslon
  Antique)."

  body: "Ah. Looking at my post, with the specimen-book examples taken out of their
    context, they do not look so dated; but it is also clear that the sample from
    an Elston Press publication is, or seems to be, much bolder than they are, although
    not otherwise differing much in typeface.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I found the specific
    book alleged to be set in Caslon Old Roman on the web page from which I learned
    that name, and it was digitized more clearly; here is a sample from it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elston_hesp_3811.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
    again, it seems as good as the products of those private presses that commissioned
    their own types rather than simply buying suitable types from standard suppliers."
