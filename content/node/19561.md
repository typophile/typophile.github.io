  body: Can't speak to Movable Type  but between Textpattern and Wordpress I'd recommend
    Wordpress for it's superior backend UI. If you're a bit of a nerd and feel like
    tinkering Textpattern may be a good option but If you're just looking to get up
    and running quickly with some minor tweaks Wordpress is your best bet.

  body: They all have very similar feature sets. Wordpress has the largest user group.
    MT has tech support, if you pay for it. Textpattern I have not used. I think you'd
    be happy with any of them. If you don't want to host your own, consider TypePad
    or Blogger (free).

    I am still intrested in what typophiles feel about it because we would probobly
    be looking for the same things."

  body: I don't think one of these is more typographically advanced than the other.
    They all use HTML and HTML/CSS is what limits our typography on screen. Albeit,
    of course, hacks like <a href="http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr/">sIFR</a> and
    <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">Smarty Pants</a>.

  body: I'm reading up on them right now. Smarty Pants is great. sIFR I don't understand
    in their example sites where it is being used. Because I am ignorant of the technology.

  body: Yep, using Interstate Compressed rather than a web core font. Notice you can
    select the text (tho it's a bit finicky), so it's not an image.
