  actual original outlines of the font could be fairly variated.\r\nIt could also
  have been oblique'd manually(skewed) too I guess.\r\n\r\nAll in all I'm having a
  hard time figuring this one out."

    the 'a' is what pointed me there. The serifs on this thing don't look like they
    belong.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    mutilated helvetica in an actual font.
