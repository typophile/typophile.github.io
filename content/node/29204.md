  face is conceptually based off the town planning grid of a town in New Zealand called
  Levin.\r\n\r\nHere it is. I have quite a bit of work to do on the kerning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  is the lighter weight version of the face.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/levin_4122.gif]\r\n\r\nAny
  feedback is welcome. I realise that the characters are a little odd, but that conceptually
  was what I was going for. "

  body: "I like this in general. Much of the lc seems too wide, while the uc is too
    narrow, relative to each other. But that might just be my opinion.\r\n\r\nI see
    among your punctuation you have a \"$\" and a 2-story \"a\" which I guess could
    be an alternate or an \"@\". If it is the latter, it isn't recognizable as such,
    nor is the \"$\". While the vertical bar doesn't need to be continuous or even
    necessarily penetrate the outer contours, it still needs a little more of it.
    As it is, the \"$\" looks like an \"S\" with some obscure accent of some kind.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<strong>I like it</strong>\r\nBut maybe you have to work in the spacing of
    the characters, I really think that the words are too tight. The shapes must equilibrate
    the inner spaces with the spaces between gylphs. The kerning stuff leave it for
    later. Good Luck!"

  body: Nice. I think the crossbar of f and t are a bit too short.
