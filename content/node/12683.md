body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nI've been, for various reasons a silent reader of this forum
  for a couple of years. Being a not native English speaker stopped me many times,
  plus I can't really see myself as a designer and for sure not as a type designer.
  Anyhow, if you'll pardon my brief self indulgence I'll get to the point.\r\n\r\nIn
  the past year a friend of mine has been growing a genuine interest for typefaces.
  Being an Apple enthusiast he built a web site about the new OS X feature, widgets.
  Unfortunately his enthusiasm brought him a bit too far and an Apple's Copyright
  Agent wrote him a really polite email asking to change the design of the web site
  because it used too many elements under Apple's trademark.\r\n\r\nFinding himself
  in a weak position to defend his work, he agreed to change the look of his site
  and wrote back to Apple to confirm his intentions.\r\n\r\nApple's Copyright Agent
  answered pleased, but the email caused few serious reactions. Not for the content,
  extremely pleasant, but for the choice of style. I made a PDF file of it, obviously
  obscuring all personal informations, for your appreciation.\r\n\r\nHugs,\r\nJacopo"

    would use Chalkboard. Not that either seems particularly appropriate for legal
    correspondence. '

  body: I actually see all this stuff set in something like Arial (I'm too lazy to
    look closely) although the Font Info in Acrobat mentions Comic Sans... and it
    was enough for me to understand the "irony".
