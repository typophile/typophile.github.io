  body: "I would say this is a bit of 'hand-drawn'(tool-assisted) engraving, and I
    don't know of any blackletter font that matches the details of this lettering,
    such as the flare at the bottom of the C, or the drop on the 'r'. You can see
    that the 'i' dots are not identical, if you need evidence that this is not a font.\r\n\r\n-
