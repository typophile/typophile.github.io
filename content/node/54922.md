    which is exactly that \u2013 TypePolice \u2013 in swedish. Don't know what to
    do with it quite yet, but perhaps one day I will figure it out. At first I wanted
    to blog about those poor logos and conceptual typefaces without any optical corrections
    at all in them (often made by art directors, not letter drawerers), but in the
    end I didnt want to be that person who points out errors in other peoples work,
    so I gave it up ;-)"

    of the Society of Printers in Boston. Apart from maintaining the inventory of
    the bar, the treasurer's principal duty was to distribute a printed report of
    the Society's finances after dinner at the Annual Meeting.\r\nWhen dinner was
    done, the members launched into the traditional critique of the Treasurer's Report.
    Mind you, no one paid a bit of attention to what it said about money. But woe
    to the treasurer whose column heads weren't centered properly, or whose kerning
    was imperfect. It was truly a case of Type Police Brutality."
