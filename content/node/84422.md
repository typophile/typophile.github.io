    in a particular medium, and liked (performance varies by medium), and one which
    has a suitable tone for your project\u2014there are some which are bookish, others
    which are more corporate, still others which are more suitable for retail.\r\n\r\nBear
    in mind that not all Garamonds have Garamond in the name, e.g. Sabon, Verdigris."

  body: "For which purpose and which printing condition?\r\n\r\nGaramonde Premiere
    Pro from Adobe is the most extensive Garamond interpretation and close to the
    original. Its outlines have subtitles that are best fit for good printing conditions.
    For general office use Adobe Garamond Pro might be the better choice, if you don't
    need opticals (versions for small text and big headlines) or italic small caps.
    \r\n\r\nHowever, if you print in a language with diacritical marks, then you might
    check if those characters collide with a previous lowercase /f/ of the two Adobe
    Garamonds and use a different version of Garamond. In that case I would advise
    you to resort to Sabon or to Stempel Garamond. A free version of Stempel Garamond,
    which has some flaws however, can be found on [[http://www.garamond.org|garamond.org]],
    which is an updated version of the original \u2013 and older version \u2013 in
    the [[http://www.artifex.com/downloads/|URW font package: Garamond Nr.8]]\r\n\r\nMonotype
    Garamond and the pre-packed Garamond on Windows and Mac are actually \u201Cmistitled\u201D,
    they are no Garamond, they are designed by Jannon, a historical confusion. "

  body: "Primarily for publications such as brochures and newsletters. In addition
    to that it will be used for larger pieces such as banners and signage. The print
    conditions will be good. Never on newsprint or anything like that. I started a
    new job recently and my company uses Garamond in it's branding.\r\n\r\nI have
    multiple versions on my computer which is why I am confused. I want to make sure
    I am using the best version. I have Simoncini Garamond, Garamond Premiere Pro,
    Adobe Garamond Pro, ITC Garamond, Garamond, and GaramondThree. That is a lot of
    versions. And I didn't even know that it was released under other names too. That
    gives me even more to chose from. Good to know though.\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice
    Nick. I will read online and see if I can find out more about each one and that
    will help me chose the right version for the job. "

    you have all those variants at your disposal, this can only mean one thing \u2014
    playtime!\r\n\r\nWhen setting a headline or text, pit several variants against
    one another, tweaking each according to its needs to try and make it the best
    looking. For heads, play with kerning and tracking, for text, h&j's.\r\n\r\nYou
    might even consider mixing them up in the same document."

    <a=href\"http://www.100types.com/100types.com.4garamond.html\">more background
    reference</a> should you need it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the resources you say you
    have at your disposal, try to avoid the ITC Garamond (also Apple Garamond if you
    have it); they are both artificially condensed and look weird on the line. I have
    never used the Simoncini, so wouldn't comment, but the Garamond Three is a Linotype
    digitisation of the the old ATF Garamond, which, like the Monotype Garamond (as
    Peter says) is a historical misattribution. That leaves Garamond Premiere Pro
    and Adobe Garamond Pro, both of which will serve you well in a variety of weights,
    styles, sizes and applications.\r\n\r\nThere is also <a=href\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/old-claude-lp/\">LP

    a brilliant Postmodern interpretation.\r\nIt has more pizzazz than the sober Adobe
    Garamonds, and may be just what you need.\r\nThe condensed styles are a tour-de-force,
    so unusual for a garalde.\r\nAs I said, try it and make up your own mind.\r\n\r\nThe
    Condensed is <strong>not</strong> artificial, as can be seen by scaling it horizontally

  body: I was always surprised how well ITC Garamond worked for the small text in
    the MacWarehouse catalog (that would be in the early '90s), as in my prior experience
    with it as phototype it usually fell apart in small text, due to the limitations
    of that process, which were overcome by direct-to-plate laser imaging. With digital,
    it was suddenly like the printed offset image had the detail that was previously
    only visible in an RC (resin coated) proof.

    are not a reference for contemporary design. "
