  recognizes this one it would be appreciated. Some characters seem boldface (e,h,f,w,v,l...)
  while others seem lighter (a,n,g,s,r,o...) If anybody can help me ID this it would
  be great. I have spent hours poring over web pages.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_5756.gif]"

  body: You'll be better off using FF Trixie and alternating the weights whilst setting
    your text for a much more convincing effect.
