  body: "Yes this is derived from Engravers Old English [img:sites/default/files/old-images/EngraversOldEnglishInUse_4687.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/engravers-old-english-mt/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/engrvrs-old-eng/\r\nI
    checked the home page of your supply store and find that _BORN~X~RAISED_ is a
    logo for a casual clothing company -- in the Los Angeles streetwear style -- and
    that it also uses similar letters for various slogans on its products. Presumably
    the company's designer simplified the Engravers Old English alphabet for it's
    product line, or used a existing simplified alphabet. Other companies, such as
    Nike have done the same thing with blackletter alphabets. AFAIK nothing digital
    is available for purchase by the public.\r\nThere are various other attempts to
    simplify the design including a typewriter typeface for the IBM Selectric designed
    in the 1970s\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OldeWorldIBMSelectricTypeballIBM_3906.jpg]\r\nwhich
    has some similarity to the letters.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "I knew I had seen the _BORN~X~RAISED_ letters before. \r\nThe letters are
    very similar to iron on lettering from a craft store, Hobby Lobby which are made
    by \"Joy - Letter Shop.  See http://shop.hobbylobby.com/crafts-hobbies-and-fabric-crafts/iron-on-letters-and-numbers/?brand=Joy&dimensions=2%22\r\nSo
    if you want a name for this font you could call it Joy Old English.\r\nDon"
