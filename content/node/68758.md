body: "Can anyone comment on the production quality of the 2001 \"two volumes in one\"
  Oak Knoll / British Library reprinting of DB Updike's <cite>Printing Types: Their
  History, Forms, and Use</cite> (<a href=http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=63429>details
  here</a>)? How does it fare in comparison with the various other printings that
  have been published over the years?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have both volumes
  consolidated in a singular tome, but I'm fearful that the image fidelity is sub-par
  due to the reproduction processes they might have used. I read through <a href=http://typophile.com/node/2365>this
  past thread</a> on the topic, but there isn't any definitive report on the 2001
  version there. Or did I miss it?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
