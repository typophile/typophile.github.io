body: Can anyone help me figure out what the typeface used on the NYC subway signage
  is?  <BR>&#40;Not the mosaics or the station names on columns -- but, the letters/numbers
  in circles identifying the line, and the black signage with white type above the
  tracks / giving directions in the station.&#41; <BR>I think it&#39;s either Akzidenz
  or Helvetica? <BR>Thanks in advance!

    MTA, etc.&#41; did not show it  had been discussed before. Sorry!

  body: Speaking of subways, anyone else notice that the new trains &#40;the ones
    that make that mournful ooh-ee-ooh noise as they leave the station&#41; have done
    away with the color-coding? They use LEDs, which are always red, to identify the
    line. It&#39;s a real shame since the often-imitated color-coded circles were
    a brilliant graphic device and enabled you to tell what train was coming down
    the track from a great distance.

  body: Patricia -- I have noticed the new trains&#39; LEDs, too, and will miss the
    color-coded circles when they are phased out! I wonder why they don&#39;t just
    change the colors of the LED circles by line. <BR> <BR>Metadox -- Thank you for
    those examples!

    2nd Avenue subway built. And say NO to the Jets Statium!

  body: NO to Jets Stadium! With you on that one. <BR>And no to the Olympics too -
    who needs the crowds?  <BR>But I&#39;m a curmudgeon. I miss the down and dirty
    seventies when the streets were safe for pimps and hookers. NY ain&#39;t the same.
    <BR> <BR>I think the new cars are too bright inside. But I&#39;m in a pissy mood
    since I just got off a train that was going about 5 miles an hour and crowded.
    I could have walked faster.

  body: If they build that stadium we will have a 600 million dollar debt and no guarantees
    of any revenue being developed. Think of it a 1.5 billion stadium project and
    the thing only gets used 8 times a year. Bloomberg has gone mad.  <BR> <BR>NO
    Olympics!
