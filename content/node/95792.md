body: "I\u2019ve always wondered why something as iconic as the Paris Metro sign has
  never been turned into a font, until now.  Of course, strictly speaking it\u2019s
  not even a logo.  Google it and you\u2019ll find almost as many versions of it as
  there are Metro stations \u2013 from plain block letters to the most exquisite Art
  Nouveau.  \r\n\r\nThe example shown here is fairly typical however, and the one
  I\u2019ve used as a template for creating a font (Paris Metro from Studio K at myfonts.com)
  \ It\u2019s bold with a hint of Art Nouveau, which I\u2019ve echoed in the high
  bridges of the H, M and N, and the top heavy D, G and O.  For some reason the original
  sign has only one cross tie on the T, and I decided to retain this little quirk,
  although I could see no logical reason for the inconsistency.\r\n\r\nAimez vous
  the finished result?  It should be great for any design project to which you want
  to add a strong gallic flavour!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Metro Alphabet_5278.png]"
