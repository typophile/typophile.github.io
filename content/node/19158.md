  need your opinions to a font i am trying to create. it is a first draft of the font.
  i know it is in hebrew, and most of you dont read it, but i still hope i can learn
  from your comments. it is my first intent to make a complete alphabet.\r\nthanks
  a lot.\r\ndani[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture 23.png]"

  body: Not knowing much about Hebrew, other than what Mel Gibson taught me,  it feels
    a little too geometric and industrial for a subject that is completely humanistic
    in quality. I would re-approach this using a sans with contrasted strokes.

  body: Are you saying that there shouldn't be Hebrew font designs that are made of
    angles? Then should there be no Russian fonts that have curves in them, or no
    Chinese fonts without stroke contrast? You can make any sort of design for any
    sort of language, as long as it's readable. I think this is quite good; I like
    the round-cornered counters inside square shapes. However, other than to respond
    to Prakash Nair's post, I'm not really going to be able to offer you anything.
    (Sorry to get your hopes up for a good critique)

  body: 'My Hebrew is weak, so I''m not the best to comment. But to me the lamed and
    kof are hard to read at first as those letters, the aleph looks awkward, and pe
    seems odd in being closed. To me this just feels awkward and not knitting together
    as one aleph-bet, but I may be off base. Ask Israeli designers for a more expert
    opinion.   '

  body: "hey!\r\nthank you for your commnts.\r\ni guess that the reason that some
    of the letters are a little bit different is to experiment how much can i stretch
    the use of them and still be able to understand them. it is still beeing checked
    (thow the alef - was used to be flipped even in earlier versions of hebrew). what
    i am trying to give to the magazine is its own character by using bold, propaganda
    type. \r\nanyway more comment are welcome (form of the letters, how to build the
    numbers, is the angles - rounded and square are working together? etc.).\r\nthanks\r\ndani"

  body: "deshvil,\r\n\r\nMy main critique is that while the majority of letters are
    quite\r\nconventional, there are a few that are bizarre (peh, quf & lamed).\r\nI
    don't think that you can create a style by changing a few letters.\r\n\r\nThe
    features that create the style should be applied to the\r\nmajority of the letters.\r\nThis
    is rough critism for sure because it goes down to basics but\r\nI don't want to
    discourage you.\r\n\r\nMuch depends of the subject of the magazine. What kind
    of \"atitude\"\r\nwill the magazine have?\r\n(Back in the sixties, many trendy
    magazines were almost impossible\r\nto read because of the desire of the font
    designer to be different)\r\nKeep at it!\r\n\r\nMike\r\ncunliffethompson.com/font"

    body: "dear david \r\nthanks for the comment, and for the questiones:\r\n1. it
      is a quote from somebody that gave me inspiration to that font (personal joke)
      i hope you were not ofended. \r\n2.whats going on with that is that i decided
      that i want two headlines font runing and not one.\r\n3. i think miriam is a
      grate font (and old doesn't mean that it's no good). this version of miriam
      (renewed by michal sahar) althogh heaving problems is a grate text font.\r\n\r\ni
      think that those decisiones of typography are helping giving the magazine more
      charactar (though i know we had some problems with that, but i think those problems
      can be fixed while the magazine will grow a little bit and adjust itself.\r\ndani"
