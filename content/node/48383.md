body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have posted previously a thread about my amateur attempts to
  make screen font display more crisp on LCD screens, while still preserving font
  shape. I would like to get some expert advice/opinion about the potential of the
  method described bellow to display screen fonts.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to have a method
  applicable to any font. The SubLCD approach (invented by Kim Oyhus, see http://www.oyhus.no/SubLCD.html)
  is claimed to allow a 2x compression on the horizontal axis essentially without
  loss of information through subpixel rendering.\r\n\r\nThe obvious thing I tried
  to do was to generate output text/font (as bitmap, DIB) at 2X higher horizontal
  resolution than requested, then resize it to the final dimension.\r\n\r\nI used
  Ghostscript (GS) to obtain the bitmap of a pdf page (antialiased fonts) (Image 1)
  then resized it (result: Image 2). Compare with Image 4) - GS output without any
  modification. The method produces some color artifacts that on some LCDs can be
  annoying.\r\n\r\nTo me, it seems that font shape is more consistently preserved
  by SubLCD (Img 2) vs Adobe rendering (img 3) and fonts are still readable at small
  sizes, but the color artifacts make this method still not very useable. \r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know what do you think about the potential of this method based on the the
  results shown bellow:\r\n\r\n  1. Ghostscript image: Original bitmap used to render
  the text: 2X size (180% zoom)\r\n  2. Ghostscript image: Final text obtained by
  resizing 1) to 1X (90% zoom).\r\n  3. Adobe image: The same text as in 2) rendered
  in Adobe Acrobat reader 94.\r\n  4. Ghostscript image: Text at 1X (90% zoom) without
  modifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any comments\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T3_All2_5663.PNG]"
