  on a decent laser printer at 1200dpi and plain office paper?\r\n\r\nPalatino works
  well (obviously, so does TNR...)\r\nSo do Trump and Lexicon and Stone, but Dante
  MT gets lost.\r\n\r\nHave you had any good or bad experiences?"

    for your general question, or to specify more (narrow) you question using others
    parameters.

  body: I think that fonts with simple outlines rather than lots of cupping, curving,
    flanging and just off-vertical or off-horizontal lines work best. The old Monotype
    drawing office usually produced work like this. Bembo Book, built on the same
    principles, is also fine at 1200 dpi.

  body: 'I''d agree with George. I''ll bet <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=171">Paperback</a>
    would maintain quite well on a printer like that. John Downer designed it using
    his faceting technique. '

  body: 'Oranda takes a beating, and virtually no-one uses it! I used on some weird
    copier machine (that worked like screenprinting, usd real ink) at 600pdi and it
    took it like a man. But then it was designed for early digital. '

  body: "I am looking for the font Pazlina Normal for a PC.  We had some graphic design
    done with the font on a MAC and would like to incorporate it into more every day
    use on our PCs. I am having some issues finding it for PC.\r\n \r\nDo you have
    any other suggestions as to where I might find this font?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: "I saw a very satisfactory rendering of sabon on a laser printer - from latex.
    But aldus wasn't successful on the same equipment.\r\n\r\nMade me think how fancy
    one can go. For example, would albertina (which is not fancy) work? or garamond
    pp?"
