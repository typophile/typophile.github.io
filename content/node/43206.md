  body: "... For those of you that are unaware of Spiekermann, he is one of the typographic
    Gods of the graphic design world ...\r\n\r\nhuuuuh ... I dont't know if he would
    really like being called a typographic God ... but the sentence fits perfectly
    to the image ;-)\r\nNice interview, thanks for the link! As always ... i like
