body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI am back with another mystery (for me anyway). Thank you again
  to those that have helped me previously. \r\n\r\nSouthwest Airlines uses this Script
  font on the nose of several aircraft that carry  special paint schemes.\r\n\r\nI
  have tried \"El Greco\", \"Florens\" and \"Calligraphy\" by Cassidy & Greene. I
  do not think it is \"Flourish\" by Judith Suttcliffe from the Cassidy & Green site,
  but I can no longer download that font to test it either way. Here is an example:\r\n\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v319/windchill/cali_one.jpg\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBrian "

    of course."

    body: "I can accept that. I took a class in hand lettering/calligraphy, and I
      could see it being custom (especially because it says \"California\"- it reminds
      me of a good wine label, and Cali's well known for their wineries).\r\n\r\nI
      am assuming those are vinyl graphics. I have to admit I'm in the habit of assuming
      digital type is used whenever vinyl graphics are concerned, only because that's
      what I do for a living, and it's just so rare to see something truely custom-tailored
      like that.\r\n\r\nNext time though, I'm going to get that cigar. :-)\r\n\r\n"

    the ID letters and numbers are painted onto the plane). I would say that they
    probably have a signage person (unless it is a camera trick the two letter Is
    have different weights) \r\n\r\nSome similar - but definitely not the same - suggestions
    could be:\r\nCaxton Light Italic (distorted) shares some similarities with the
    sample. \r\nOr Cataneo Light beaten into shape. \r\n\r\nSorry I can't be more

  body: "I agree vinyl would probably not work on a jetliner. I don't pretend to know
    all the techniques used, but it seems like some method might be used to transfer
    an outline that was font-based on to the fuselage, so that the painter can reproduce
    logotype lettering as exactly as possible.  Airlines like Alaska, or Horizon Air,
    that use script logo types, must have a way to make sure the lettering is duplicated
    exactly.\r\n\r\nDo we have anyone here with experience about commercial airline
    lettering?\r\n\r\n  - Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks Bert. A 'vinyl frisket' was a new term for me, but Google searches
    quickly helped understand that it's like an adhesive stencil -- just lift out
    the letters cut from the vinyl where you want the paint, and then peel away the
    rest of the  vinyl after the paint dries.  Apparently a plotter-like gadget can
    be used to make the frisket rolls, and even cut the letters (?)\r\n\r\nNow, back
    to the question of what font was used -- I'm still of the opinion that this was
    a custom font, or custom lettering used to make the frisket masters.\r\n\r\n -

  body: "@Mike,\r\n\r\nThe signmaker I use a lot to produce by designs still works
    this way when outdoor lettering has to withstand the elements for a long time.
    They cut the stencils on the same machine used for vinyl lettering, just reversed,
    and then \u2014 after applying the vinyl on the substrate \u2014 paint in the
    exposed areas, mostly using rollers... Multiple colour jobs are just repeat exercises
    (wait until paint is dried, apply different stencil/frisket, paint, etc.).\r\n\r\nA
    very long time ago I used to illustrate with airbrush \u2014 using friskets all
    the time (cut by hand, of course). The (self adhesive) material itself was called
    Frisket (still have some Letraset branded lying around). Its guess its one of
    those cases where a brand name became generic (like aspirin).\r\n\r\nBTW The oldfashioned
    way to work was by using stencils cut out of paper, weighing it down on the illustration
    board with whatever was at hand (eg pieces of leading from a print shop ; )).
    Soft edges could be created by gently pulling up the edges. Those were the days\u2026\r\n\r\n@Brian:
    Dont despair, I think someone will come with an answer to your question!"
