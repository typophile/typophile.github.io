body: "Hello all\r\n\r\nI've just received a brief to pitch for a magazine about a
  Jazz festival. I have one day to put something together. Initial thoughts are that
  it needs to have high production value - to be kept as a souvenir, yet portable
  and practical as it will also act as a guide to the festival and be taken away post
  concerts - therefore smaller than A4.\r\n\r\nAs it coincides with the 21st anniversary
  they want to highlight past performers as well as the current crop. I'm thinking
  design-wise it should be very contemporary, and probably on an offset (uncoated
  stock).\r\n\r\nTypewise I'm inclined to go sans and was notionally thinking of using
  Gotham Rounded for heads and narrow for text, plus maybe a slab (any suggestions?).
  My feeling that using a serif might be too traditional. However I'm open to any
  ideas?\r\n\r\nCan anyone make any traditional arguments for using specific type
  or suggestions of other faces to try out?\r\n\r\nAny help at this point gratefully
  received!\r\n\r\nThanks"

    I don\u2019t like the rounded version but that\u2019s another story.\r\n\r\n You
    could pair it with FF More. It\u2019s a little bit slappy but still some kind
    of traditional. If you want it more slab, try Adelle. A wee bit softer is FF Tisa.\r\n\r\nA
    very beautiful combination, in my opinion, is Gotham with Mercury. It looks timeless
    and by far not old fashioned. Why don\u2019t give it a try?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nFlorian"
