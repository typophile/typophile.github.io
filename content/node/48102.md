  what's the name of the main font used in this composition?\r\n\r\nLooks like and
  kind of reminds me of the one Lance Wyman created for the Olympic Games in 1968...\r\n\r\n"

  body: Alright, I knew I'd seen this one before.  It looks like it is ITC Aki Lines.  That
    being impossible (as I have yet to hear of a digitization of it) it must be the
    emulation of Aki Lines on Dafont called <a href="http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=akka&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=TIFFONT&nb_ppp=10&classt=alpha">Akka</a>.  If
    I am wrong, someone correct me.
