  body: "It's our own work (character design included) thus our image.\r\nIt's made
    using two cardboard g's, front and back. Paper cups give it its height, glued
    everything together using wood glue. We then wrapped it in torn strips of paper
    using wallpaper glue.\r\nA day's work if you bored on a sunday :)"
