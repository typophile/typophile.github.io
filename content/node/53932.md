  I was trying to track it down at my account page, but could not find how to reset
  it to display more (all?) comments to a thread right away. I dislike the paged view
  pretty much.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"

  body: I concur. While the paged view does allow for slightly faster loading, especially
    in long threads that include multiple inline images, the "new post" flags get
    erased if they're past the first page of the thread, making it difficult to pick
    up where one left off. In the full thread view the flags remained regardless of
    the length of the thread.

    to switch of (in vain!) this \"feature\". (a BUG, if you ask me).\r\n\r\nIf it's
    not a user preference, dear typophile admins, could you please, please, pretty
    please fix it so, that the \"new\" tag stays preserved (or that one jumps to the
    page with the first new post if one clicks on the new posts link in the tracker
    or userpage/tracker?).\r\n\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"

  body: "One more vote for non-paged threads! I often go back to older threads in
    order to find a certain quote or link etc. It\u2019s very annoying that I have
    to search 3 or 4 pages now instead of a single one. \r\n\r\n<cite>While the paged
    view does allow for slightly faster loading, especially in long threads that include
    multiple inline images</cite>\r\nThat kind of thread is the absolute exception.
    Actually, the battles and the Type ID Quizes are the only examples for threads
    with more than a few images that come to my mind. And those are restarted regularly
    anyway. Paged threads slow me down far more than a handful of JPGs. "

  body: I don't have a problem with paged theads per definition; although I would
    like it if you go to the last page of the thread by default when viewing one.
    And would also like it when you post in a paged thread, that you automatically
    return to your post, instead of page 1.

  body: "From this user's perspective, any savings in speed loading a page is more
    than offset by the time and nuisance of having to then click through and load
    additional pages in order to find where you last left off in the thread. This
    is further encumbered by the issue of the \"new\" tag being lost, as has been
    mentioned.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A quick and dirty response:\r\n\r\nRecently we changed the number of posts
    per page from 50 to 30, because of the Type Battles mostly. Loading 50 images
    per page (for dozens of users at a time) was killing the server and bringing not
    just one thread down, but the entire site.\r\n\r\nYour feedback has been noted
    and we are hoping to make some changes to address these issues.\r\n\r\nLogo: We
    are aware that the link going back home is broken. We did not do this on purpose,
    but there is a bug somewhere in the Flash file that is preventing the link back.
    Will fix asap."
