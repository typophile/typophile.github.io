  body: That seems to be it. Thank you very much. Zaph is on my pc but doesn't seem
    to be showing up in any adobe programs. I may have never found it on my own. Thanks
    again.

    And look at the bottom of the available font list in Adobe suite. If the font
    has a different language codepage it appears there instead of alphabetic order.\r\n\r\nCheers"
