  with some friends today. As we were leaving, I noticed a T-shirt that said \"The
  quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" in something like Bodoni Poster Italic.
  We had to go, but I noted that there were some other T-shirt designs next to it
  and that brand of these shirts was World Typographers. Some of them look cool.\r\n\r\nhttp://ut.uniqlo.com/search#cat_id=0&key_id=35&key_label=WORLD%20TYPOGRAPHERS&gender=1_1_1&num=30&order=date&page=0\r\nhttp://www.hellogas.com/worldtypographers/"
