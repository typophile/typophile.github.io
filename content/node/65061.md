body: "Is anyone able to identify what the model might be for this typeface is? It
  comes from the \"Doctrina Christiana\" published in 1593 in Manila, the Philippines.
  The book was a bilingual primer of Catholic doctrine in Spanish and Tagalog in this
  typeface, and Tagalog in the indigenous Baybayin script. The printing was done not
  with moveable type but with woodblocks in the Chinese style, cut by a Chinese convert.
  I assume the Latin typeface used here \u2013 or typefaces, since there are also
  decorative black letter caps set off from the main text \u2013 must be based on
  something from Spain or perhaps from Italy. Any ideas? \r\n\r\nHere's a link to
  the Project Gutenberg online book:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16119[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dc020_6385.gif]"

  body: I'm guessing that any connection to an actual typeface would only be through
    the mind and pen of Franciscan Friar Juan de Plasencia, who must of written the
    Doctrina by hand before turning it over to the printer to carve in wood.

  body: 'Thanks, Michael, for the pointer. On a hunch, I found illustrations online
    of Mexican versions of the Doctrina, with similar, but not identical typefaces
    (done in movable type). The Mexican versions are somewhat more broken and rectilinear
    than the forms of the Philippine Doctrina, whose letterforms are more humanist
    in appearance. '
