  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello there. I am a designer and web developer. However, lately I found myself oddly attracted to typefaces, and I would like to create my own. I already know quite a bit about vector images and other tools needed to create fonts, but I would like to learn more about the actual designing process of a typeface:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to maintain consistency between letters in a typeface?</li>
<li>What features make certain letters easier or harder to read?</li>
<li>What are 'standard' metrics and ratios used for different kinds of typefaces, and what are the pros and cons of each?</li>
<li>What design choices were made in famous fonts like, for instance, Helvetica, and why?</li>
<li>What features are important for a text font, and what features are important for a headline font?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure that there must be quite a few books or ebooks about these subjects. However, I have not been able to find anything myself yet only finding books about &lsquo;typesetting books&rsquo; than books about typesetting.</p>

<p>Jeez, I seem to be in a sarcastic mode. Am I missing your question here? I entered</p>
<p>&ldquo;designing typefaces for the web&rdquo; in</p>
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">https://duckduckgo.com/</a></p>
<p>The third listing was actually about typeface design,</p>
<p><a href="http://vector.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/how-to-design-typefaces-fonts/">http://vector.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/how-to-design-typefaces-fonts/</a></p>
<p>many of those links might interest you, esp.</p>

<p>Took about 3 minutes, with the first-try topic I searched for&hellip; (While I only bill $60/hr, I do have a 4-hour minimum. Where do I send the bill? I do charge when the asker is too lazy to make a simple, kindergarten effort)</p>
<p>The only tip here you possibly haven&rsquo;t seen is to use DuckDuckGo to cut down the incessant adds on Google when the topic being searched returns so many possibilities to sell you something&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello mister Ellertson.</p>
<p>I am familiar with DuckDuckGo, and I love it for its trackinglessness and its zero-click tools.
I am very sorry to have wasted your time. I thought I was asking a valid question; in hindsight it looks like my initial search-queries were badly formulated.</p>
<p>The main reason that I created this topic was not to let other people search for me, but to ask designers who have been making typefaces for a long time on their opinions of must-read books about creating typefaces. I would rather have the opinion of a professional instead of &lsquo;8 must-read tips about typefaces&rsquo;, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>The article you link to is very interesting. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I also happened to come across <a href='http://typophile.com/node/12157'>this page on the Typophile wiki</a> earlier today, which was hidden quite deeply. It seems like a great list to pick some books from.</p>
<p>But if anyone else would like to share their professional opinion to offer on this subject, I&rsquo;m all ears.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and effort,</p>
<p>~W-M</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good for you, the Typophile wiki you cite is a very good place to start. Much better than internet musings.</p>
<p>The only thing I&rsquo;d add, that shows up all too rarely, is the fit of letters, esp. in running text (rather than in a few letters or words, as found in headlines or advertisements).</p>
<p>The letterforms themselves, and how to draw them for various implementations (many ways to put ink on paper or pixels on a screen), are one thing. The fit of them in all their possible combinations, and the inevitable compromises that occasions, is something that just doesn&rsquo;t make it into print. Probably this is because because compromise is always involved, and compromise always means more than one solution is possible. As best I can tell, this is a skill you have to develop yourself, and for most of us, it does not come quickly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;ve come to the right place (even though so far you&rsquo;ve only received advice from somebody who has never designed a font). It&rsquo;s only recently that Typophile has become sufficiently usable again, so hopefully you&rsquo;ll get some real help soon.</p>
<p>The thing is, a really good book on type design has yet to be written. But Cheng&rsquo;s &ldquo;Designing Type&rdquo;* does a good job of opening eyes. As does what we around here call The Triumvirate: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/15349">http://typophile.com/node/15349</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509">http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly learning to design type seems to involve a great deal of observation, and a necessarily personal development of style. Just be prepared to invest a lot of time, with only a small likelihood of substantial material reward.</p>
