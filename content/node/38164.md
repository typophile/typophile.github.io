  body: 'My experience with screen printing is that it is essentially trial-and-error.
    That is, factors such as emulsion and ink are also critical. If you''re setting
    up your image in Photoshop, you may have to output with a reasonable guess and
    be prepared to redo it if necessary. '

    for your pull and sufficient off-contact. A dull squeegee will cause dot gain,
    and uneven pressure or speed will result in  an uneven ink deposit. If there is
    any subtle shading, you may want to introduce a second (spot) colour.\r\n\r\nMy
    experience with screen printing didn't really allow for a lot of trial and error
    :) \r\n\r\n\r\nR"

  body: "if you're just doing a one-color screenprint, the best thing to do is halftone
    it with 65 lpi (frequency/lines-per-inch). here's a quick guide i put together.\r\n01/start
    off with your photograph. like most things you print, it should be 300dpi. some
    silkscreeners debate this, but i also print at 300 and get good results.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_5689.jpg]\r\n\r\n02/convert
    it to grayscale using image>mode>grayscale. play with the levels if necessary.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/02_4785.jpg]\r\n\r\n03/when
    you're all set, go into print preview. in the option box that says color management
    (i put it in red), select output.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/03_6037.jpg]\r\n\r\n04/in
    the output  menu, select \"screen.\"\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/04_6015.jpg]\r\n\r\n05/in
    the screen menu, make sure you uncheck your default printer settings.\r\n\r\nfor
    frequency, enter 65 lines/inch. since you're using a 195 mesh, and i'm assuming
    that it's not a dyed mesh, this is probably the highest frequency you can get
    away with. any larger, and the dots will get too small for your screen to pick
    up, and you'll end up losing them.\r\n\r\nfor angle, i would put in 45. if this
    is just a one-color print, it won't matter. once you start introducing more colors,
    angle becomes critical so you don't develop any weird distortions. again, since
    this is just a one-color job, use the key angle of 45. if you want to do more,
    google \"cmyk halftone screenprinting\" or some combination of that.\r\n\r\nwhen
    you get this high of a frequency, the shape of your half-tone doesn't really matter,
    but i've always been told to do ellipse since it's \"the best.\"\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/05_4728.jpg]\r\n\r\nhope
    this helps!"
