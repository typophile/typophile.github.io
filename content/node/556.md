    with only types, not the effect.

  body: That&#39;s close, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it -- there are too many
    little differences. But I haven&#39;t been able to find a better match, especially
    with such a perfectly round O like that. Misa, where did this sample come from?

  body: Hi Cheshire, <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know where they are located, but it is an
    Italian restaurant. I think it is in somewhere in or around Texas. Somebody must
    have made this on a PC, not on a Mac, because I got this on a PC disc &#40;this
    is just my guess&#41;. <BR> <BR>I know it sound odd that I don&#39;t know who
    they are... I work for a packaging company and I get so many requests to recreate
    logos from all over the U.S. That is why I sometimes need help here to identify
    fonts that I cannot tell. <BR> <BR>Before I knew about Typophile, it was much
    harder because forum at myfonts is o.k. Somebody there wrote about Typophile,
    so I came here... This is the best site ever for me, and I appreciate you guys
    sooooo much. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12727.jpg"

  body: It seems like that &#34;Italian Grill&#34; should provide some clues, as I&#39;m
    guessing it&#39;s all one typeface. Those low, sharp serifs on the italic, the
    wide crossbar and short top on the t -- it must be a font we can find, but I&#39;ve
    looked up and down MyFonts and haven&#39;t been able to nail it down. Not one
    of the million Garamonds, not a Palatino. Arrgh!
