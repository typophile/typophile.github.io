body: "When I was younger, I used to draw typefaces and heavy metal logos in my school
  books and on my Amiga computer (using DeluxePaint). As an adult, I kept my passion
  for fonts, but I never took the time to learn to use font editing tools. But when
  Fontstruct came along, I decided to try to create my first TrueType typeface. \r\n\r\nThe
  typeface is kind of constructivist and kind of eighties heavy metal-ish. I quite
  like some of the characters (especially the look of the word <em>kjekke</em> in
  the sample), but would like some advice on how I can improve the typeface and which
  characters need improvement."

  body: "When you get into the smaller sizes (which I imagine is somewhere around
    24pt in the pdf), the A and R get a little difficult to tell apart, as well as
    the D and O. The rounded edges should perhaps have a larger radius. If you continue
    into thinner weights, the problem may resolve itself a little bit. Most of the
    letter without diagonals look sort of like a Bank gothic condensed, but I like
    the touches added to the ends of the F, J(#1), E, M (#2), and Q. I'm not sure
    of why on some characters, you decided to use round or sharp edges, like where
    it's round on the top of the F, bottom of E, but not round in the upper left corner
    of the P, or the 3. Something about the 2 is off. Maybe you could take a cue from
    the Z. The Four seems to be the only character with a rounded terminus, which
    seems out of character. I like the K and X alot.\r\n\r\nYou may want to look at
    the following typefaces for inspiration:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=205147\">Woodblock</a>\r\n<a

  body: "Thanks for the feedback. I just added an updated version with a new R based
    on the K, an alternate D that is easier to distinguish from the O and a few other
    changes based on your comments.\r\n\r\nI am not too sure about the V, do you think
    it looks out of place with the rest of the characters?"
