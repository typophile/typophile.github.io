body: 'HowD <BR>I&#39;m hoping to get some feedback on the logos below. First let
  me tell you the project constraints: <BR>1. The &#39;At Conservation International&#39;
  part with the line has to be there &#40;somewhere&#41;, unmodified. <BR>2. The only
  fonts I can use are Adobe Garamond, Trade Gothic, and Univers &#40;even though the
  at conservation... line is palitino-go figure&#41;. <BR>3. Those are the only shades
  of green I can use. <BR> <BR>Given all that what do you think? <BR>Thanks! <BR>Zeke

  body: zeros... <BR> <BR>i like the first one, for me it is more unified all the
    parts, and the thing that only the descender of your R makes the leaf i think
    it gives a more vegetable look, woth the others solutions, specially the second
    one i think you fall in a geometric-static look on your leaf <BR> <BR>anyway,
    nice colors, try the separation line with the VERDE green. <BR> <BR>CG

    flare-serif font. <BR> <BR>And I think all-UC might send the wrong message here.

    I can&#39;t find anything <BR>negative to say about it. Looks good. <BR> <BR>If
    I had to choose a second one I would say  <BR>go with number two. But the last
    two seem to  <BR>be trying a little too hard. <BR> <BR>-smc <BR>

  body: I am agree with Cristian, and i think that the firs solution is the better,
    but the layout is messy. Maybe if you talke that big V on verde and make them
    to descend to make the top of the logo as a line, at the same at the bottom phrase.
    Now you got a logo just with the R descendent, thge rest of the information need
    to be secondary, <BR> <BR>Nice Idea, and colors <BR> <BR>MH

  body: The first, although cramped is the least clever. And in this instance I don&#39;t
    think clever is what you want. Although the <i>fake</i> smallcaps aren&#39;t helping
    either. Do you have a version of this face with <i>real</i> smallcaps? The &#39;R&#39;
    needs to be given some it&#39;s florentine roots back. You&#39;ve stretched the
    curve too much and it shows. It would be more elegant, and natural, if you could
    create the leaf from the natural stroke of the &#39;R&#39;. This would also fix
    the clotting in between the &#39;R&#39; and the &#39;D&#39;. As well, it would
    also force your to drop the leaf a little lower which it needs. Hrant suggestion
    about  a little less all caps might be nice to explore as well. And if you must
    use a <i>fake</i> smallcap, limit it to only the word Verde. I really like the
    colors. They seem crisp and elegant. Smart Papers makes something with this kind
    of scheme that would be beautiful. And one more thing. The word &#39;AT&#39; seems
    to be an afterthought. It needs to fit into the scheme, not float outside of it.

  body: It&#39;s nice overall. I&#39;ll second what Tiffany wrote about cleverness.
    <BR> <BR>The whole &#34;at Conservation International&#34; line needs work.  <BR>It
    seems like it could be smaller. Try a different typeface  <BR>perhaps, or try
    changing the case as Hrant suggests.

  body: Is the line required?    <BR>  <BR>Here is a quick remix suggestion of your
    last version.  <BR>I could have verbally explained what I meant but   <BR>this
    was easier.   <BR>  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/9042.gif"
    alt="">  <BR>  <BR>The remix would still need work. I might make   <BR>&#34;at
    conservation international&#34; smaller and letter   <BR>space it a bit more for
    starters.  <BR>  <BR>Could you make &#34;fund&#34; the same color as   <BR>&#34;venture?&#34;  It  would
    make the color balanced. <BR> <BR>Did the dark green change from your first post
    <BR>or is it just a screen thing? If it did change the  <BR>first dark green was
    better. <BR>  <BR>You are progressing well.   <BR>  <BR>-sean michael  <BR>

    the project they decide to dump the word &#39;Fund&#39;. <BR>So here is where

  body: Zero, the last version looks very good. It restores the balance now the word
    &#39;Fund&#39; is gone.  <BR>Perhaps the only things I would change are the capital
    C and I in the small sentence. But that&#39;s personal. <BR> <BR>Sell it. It&#39;s
    ready. <BR> <BR>Ren
