  body: "As creating logos is part of your work, I suppose you are not only a \"software
    development company\", but also active in corporate design and brand strategy.
    \r\n\r\nIn \"Corporate Religion\", Jesper Kunde wrote that the essence of strong
    brands is not the quantitative parameters (such as those you mentioned, \"timely\"
    and \"cost-effective\"), but emotional values and spirit. \r\n\r\nRegardless whether
    this is the right place to introduce businesses, when you do, do it in a memorable
    way. Put some more time in your elevator pitch. \r\n\r\n "
