  <BR> <BR>I am trying to search for more information regarding East German typography
  and typographers. Specifically: <BR> <BR>1. Albert Kapr  <BR>He was a type designer
  and typographer who was the Art Director of TypoArt &#40;the centralized press owned
  by the East German goverment&#41;. I&#39;m trying to find out what his contribution
  towards the development of East German typography was and if anyone has samples
  of his work.  <BR> <BR>2. Influencial typographers <BR>Does anyone know of any influential
  type designers from East Germany?  <BR> <BR>3. VEB Typoart Dresden <BR>I know that
  it became the centralized press for the East German govenment. It was an almalgamation
  of a few foundries, specifically Schelter and Giesecke of Liepzig. I am particularly
  interested in its output and developement during the GDR years.  <BR> <BR>Any pointers...?
  <BR> <BR>Joyce'

  body: My co-researcher speak very basic german. So that might be a problem in translation.
    I have tried to get some of Kapr&#39;s books through British Library but were
    unable to get my hands on them. But I will try to contact Ingo and Andreas to
    see if they can help.

  body: Hmm, yes I agree. The uppercase one seem to look to much like a &#39;B&#39;
    than a sharp &#39;S&#39;. But until recently due to my ignorance of the German
    language, I kept pronuncing it as a &#39;b&#39; rather than an &#39;s&#39;! I
    just thought it was a german way of writing the letter &#39;b&#39;. Gosh, the
    Arial version looks rather clumsy, but that&#39;s Arial for you.

  body: Getting back to the original subject. I used to know Albert Kapr. He was a
    fine type and book designer, calligrapher and typographer. But his greatest accomplishment,
    in my opinion, was that he managed to preserve and develop the fine art of type
    and book design in the Communist Germany. In fact, he was a devout Communist himself,
    and he managed to convince his fellow Parteigenossen, in both Leipzig and Berlin,
    that the quality of book design and printing is important for the image &#40;and
    the economy!&#41; of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik.  <BR> <BR>Kapr was one
    of the founding fathers of the prestigeous annual book design competitions &#40;Sch

  body: Erik, could you perhaps share some of your experiences at TypoArt? What were
    the changes that you could see from its GDR days to when it was privatised? And
    is there any way I can get a copy of the TypoArt book? I was trying to do a search
    on the net for the existing TypoArt but it seems that the only one that comes
    up is a pre-press production house. From what I read, they do not produce fonts
    anymore.
