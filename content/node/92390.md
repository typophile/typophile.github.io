  have made some comparative tests with OpenSans and ttfautohint 0.8. with WinGDI
  Cleartype and Greyscale.\r\nTested original font (OpenSans regular, Light, Extra
  Bold), plus - unhinted, ttfautohint with 'taller xheight', and regular ttfautohint
  versions.\r\n\r\nThe most significant issue remaining is the rendering at small
  text sizes with bolder weights, e.g. ttfautohinted versions can't yet emulate the
  finesse of a human manually hinting chars such as 'a', 'e', 'g' etc with such few
  pixels to play with. However, to my mind in the medium size text ranges i can see
  characters rendered a bit 'better' by ttfautohint ;)\r\nAnother gripe i still have
  is that ttfautohint tends to stretch the xheight by 1 pixel at particular small
  size instances. In my screenshots this happens noticeably at 12px, where the manually
  hinted x-height retains better proportion.\r\n\r\nSuggestions for alternative fonts
  to test please. Manually hinted to 'industry standard' of course.\r\n\r\n-vern"

    the 1px \"stretch\".\r\nThat doesn't bother me all that much as long as it's consistent.\r\n\r\nWhat's
    plagued me - and stopped me from using ttfautohint for release fonts except very,
    very occasionally - is the \"shotgun\" effect. At some sizes, there's pixels drop
    out that makes the letter look like a victim at the Saint Valentines Day Massacre.
    \ (google it, bro'.)\r\nI've been neglectful and not taken screen shots. Do you
    know to what I'm referring? Have you seen it?\r\n\r\nIt tends not to happen with
    heavier weights. \r\n\r\nAlas, we're at version .8 and still there are killer
    problems. I'm discouraged.\r\n\r\nrich"

    0.99!</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nI agree. In my opinion <em>ttfautohint</em> is an amazingly
    convenient tool for (batching) autohinting. My experience with developing software
    is that the closer one comes to the of\uFB01cial release, the more dif\uFB01cult
    the problems that have to be solved become. And after seeing what has been improved
    in <em>ttfautohint</em> from the early versions on, I am pretty convinced that
    the resulting 1.0 edition will be impressive.\r\n\r\nConcerning problems with
    initial software versions, I quite well recall the ATypI conference in Rome in
    2002. We just \uFB01nished one of the \uFB01rst of\uFB01cial releases of <em>DTL&nbsp;FontMaster</em>
    and the focus during the development was on the Windows version. For Rome a Mac
    OS 9 version was compiled and I took it with me on my laptop, barely tested. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demonstrating
    it under Classic became actually a disaster, because the modules crashed constantly.
    If I remember correctly, there were some problems with a couple of MS&nbsp;libraries,
    and later I found out that a required temporary directory was missing at root
    level. Especially I remember that Yuri was <strong>quite</strong> relaxed after
    I gave him a personal, highly buggy FM-demonstration.\r\n\r\nFEB"

  body: "@Frank: Thanks for the kind words!\r\n@Richard: Version 0.8 doesn't mean
    that there will be 0.9 and then 1.0.  It will rather be 0.91, 0.92, etc. :-)  I
    agree that it would have been better to start with version 0.01...\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
    I would be glad if you can send me a snapshot of the font which behaves as you've
    described (together with a short description of your rendering environment).  It
    might be a systematic effect, but it also might be simply a bug.\r\n\r\nFor private
    reasons, I wasn't able to intensively work on ttfautohint recently.  A new version
    will appear in the next few days, this time with only small improvements (mainly
    on the documentation side, and with reduced bytecode size).\r\n"

    counting version-and-decimal.
