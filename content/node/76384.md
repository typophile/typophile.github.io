body: "I need help picking out the right font for a shampoo.  \r\n\r\nThe product
  is for men, so that's the target audience.  Yet this falls into the category of
  'personal care products', and like cosmetics the key is to make them look like objects
  of desire.  It works great for ladies products, such as all the face creams by L'Oriel
  and Clinique.  My challenge is how to make this look handsome, memorable, and an
  object of desire while not looking feminine.  Other male product fonts such as Gilette
  and AXE appear to lean towards 'overcompensating'.  Those two also happen to look
  very unmemorable to me.  \r\n\r\nI should leave it at that for now.  Please give
  any suggestions.  Thank you! \r\n"

    about something in this direction? Simplified but not as soft and overused as
