  body: "\"ohnson\" & \"hapel\" can be approximated with <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Berthold&ffam=Sorbonne%20BQ%20-%20Italic&fid=ee8fec06bf2df4dc115f256ce4561fde&fsize=60&text=Johnson%20Chapel&fit=1|Sorbonne
    BQ (Italic)]]</strong>\r\nand you could even use <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Berthold&ffam=Sorbonne%20BQ%20-%20Bold&fid=3bbbac0928e65c43555c5efb60e507ce&fsize=60&text=BUILT%201827&wrap=2|Sorbonne
    BQ (Bold)]]</strong> for the \"BUILT\"\r\n\r\nbut I doubt you can find a single
    font to match both |J| & \"C\".\r\nIf you don't need a full alphabet and your
    intention is to restore the original or create a simple logo, I propose to take
    high resolution photos of both left and right part (one photo each) and hire a
    professional graphic designer to convert them to vector format."
