  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi

I´m doing a logo for a Jazz / Soul Band, named EC[easy]. This Jazz / Soul band is new and they haven´t got any logo yet.

My problem is that I´m stuck with my idea... So I wonder if anyone could give critiques... suggestions... for this logo.

The band itself doesn´t have a logo and they asked me to make one. Something that describes in a few words: 

- new
- soul
- jazz
- easy (EC)

Other questions?

- Is this logo proper for music industry and for a Jazz / Soul Band?
- Is there some proper font that I instead could use to make an logo for the band?

Here is a link to the band: 

http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=166131331

Many Thanks,

Ted</div>

What you have done does might suit a chamber music quartet but does not really suit this band's music. Also the way the letters join looks too much like an i.</div>

The roots of most of his designs, especially the record sleeves, are classic soul and jazz covers from the '60s and '70s.

		<div class="commentbody">Being blunt, the designs so far look really clunky and forced. If you think about classic band logos, they are usually really simple ideas, which helps when you bear in mind the application - guitar picks, embroidered badges, school book doodles etc, in other words, it has to look good when really small, as well as really big and so far the ones on show wouldn't translate. Also, is the name of the band EC, or Easy? If it's EC, then why are the logos so far "easy"?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">yes. the scher thing is a great and simple approach.

it was one of the first things that sprang to mind ... but I didn't want to reference it it for fear you'd follow that path entirely. basically ... and this is what I meant by my original post ... get to know the music, attitude and feeling of the band and the genre (and the way it makes you feel) and respond to that - you'll no doubt find a whole range of great ideas there.

		<div class="commentbody">Too much. Way too much. Get rid of the splatter/stroke type. It doesn't serve a purpose. A great mantra..."Keep it simple stupid". I swear one day I am going to make myself a t-shirt so I can wear it while I'm working on projects. :) I am also plagued by the overwhelming want to put colors and colors and stuff everywhere...but...

I think you are trying too hard. The cool thing (but hardest part) about design is that you are suppose to make it look effortless. It's suppose to look like you just sort of made it in a few minutes. But behind it all, there are hours upon hours of work and tweaking and kerning and frustration and then finally...SUCCESS!

Also, the swirl doesn't read as an e, it's reads as a swirl. I do kind of like how you have the top of the s sort of following the o. That's a nice little piece there. But step back a little and clean it up. Jazz is all about the off beat. (I have played instruments for about 12 years now, including some jazz) Jazz is about the energy. You can show those things without making the text do them. It's cool to see how you're working though.

Stay away from the graphic styles of the paintbrushes in illustrator. To people that use those programs...they stick out like a sore thumb. So your logos look like you just went through all the brush styles, and changed it for each logo.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for the comments so far, what would I do without you guys/girls!

I´ve listened to youré comments so far and tried to reform this logo. 

I would apprectiate youre help by choosing THE LOGO you think I should go forward with, I know there´s allot of them at the attachment. Please do and comment on what you think is wrong and what I should do with making this logo better so it could get published! If you think there isn´t a logo fit to publish then tell me. I dont have allot of time left and the band wants this logo by next week. And I spent allot of time hoping to make a suitable logo for this band.

Many thanks to you that have commented and I hope of hearing some feedback from you now again.

Courtney to all,

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm, 4 & 6 of JPG 10 have some potential. I still say get rid of the outlines around the type. If you like this font, you can always go into illustrator -> type-> create outlines. This will make the type into vector shapes. Then you can select "expand" from the top tool bar. This will make it to where you can go through and delete those stroke lines around the type.

I do think it's going in a direction at least. I'd say put some effort into making it read "Easy Soul" and making it look clean and professional. You might end up with a fairly nice portfolio piece at the least.

The E is a handdrawn piece already. The thing is that I wanted to show some sort of energy and depth to the E, that you described earlier in the text. Do you have some other tips and tricks that I could make for the logo?

		<div class="commentbody">Too many styles if you ask me:
1. ec
2. easy soul
3. text

Especially text doesn't work at all to me. Try to check 20' or 30' posters to see what type could go with this overall style that reflects it to some degree.

This would be my last and final time to post about this logo! Tomorrow is the day that i´ll give the logo to the rightfull owners...so to speak. So i wonder what you think? Tell it straight to my face... 

I´m really glad for every comment that you have given me. Because it had helped me to come to this approach, so thank you again!

Look at old jazz and soul album cover, you might find inspiration from that and add your own flavor to it.
