  body: Damn, can't identify it either... It reminds me (a lot) [[http://losttype.com/font/?name=onramp|ONRAMP]]
    but /K is way off as long as /M centre vertex. Strange nobody's identified it
    though. Doubting but [[http://www.smokeybear.com|Smokey Bear]] may have commissioned
    a bespoke typeface...
