  body: It seems the slab serif font is called &#34;Archer&#34; and the serif font
    is &#34;Surveyor&#34; both created by Tobias Frere-Jones &#40;<a href="http://www.typography.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.typography.com/</a>&#41; for Barbara de Wilde, the
    former art director of Martha Stewart Living. Surveyor &#40;which must be the
    italics on this cover&#41; is based on old map fonts. See <a href="http://www.commarts.com/CA/featype/hoefler/"
    target="_blank">this</a> article. <BR> <BR>I couldn&#39;t find font showings for
    either, though. Maybe now that Martha&#39;s a bit hard up she&#39;ll sell these
    fonts to us peons to raise some cash.

  body: I for one like the all-orange prison wear, but that might be too street for
    Martha. <BR> <BR>My first job was working for her &#40;then&#41; husband, 20 years
    ago. She wasn&#39;t nice to me. I can&#39;t feel too sorry for her.
