  body: "The Cormack McCarthy book looks like honest-to-goodness woodtype blocks,
    probably flipped horizontally after photography. It's a whole bunch of different
    faces.\r\n\r\nThe Michael Winter book looks like a font since the distress on
    all repeated letters is the same. It looks like there might be two different 'E's;
    one thick, one thin; so it might be OpenType enabled or even have uppercase letters
    in the lowercase set.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Poplar, HFJ Knockout & HFJ Knockout are all good woodblock type fonts, but
    the above is obviously (hand made?) of several different typefaces, so you'll
    just have to experiment.\r\nThere are a lot of these typefaces out there, [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/woodtype/fonts/|here]]
    are some."

    weights of <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/giza/">Giza</a>.
