    Central European and Baltic languages (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Lithuanian,
    Latvian, Estonian, Croatian, Slovenian), and an \"Std\" font is one without those
    characters even if it contains Western European small caps, swashes etc. \r\n\r\nBut
    of course, this is the minimal prerequisite. A \"Pro\" font may contain many more
    characters for different scripts, including Cyrillic and Greek, and more Latin
    characters, as well as alternate glyphs, small caps etc. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Perhaps slightly off topic, our use of \"Pro\" in the designations of our
    CJK fonts, which are based on static glyph sets called character colections, is
    a bit different.\r\n\r\nIf a character collection Supplement contains primarily
    glyphs that correspond to character set standards, the \"Std\" designation is
    used for such fonts. Adobe-Japan1-4 (/Registry \"Adobe,\" /Ordering \"Japan1,\"
    and /Supplement 4) represents the glyph repertoire level that allows Japanese
    fonts to be declared as \"Pro\" fonts. Adobe-Japan1-4 defines 15,444 glyphs (CIDs
    0 through 15443). The current Supplement is 6 (Adobe-Japan1-6), which defines
    23,058 glyphs (CIDs 0 through 23057).\r\n\r\nGlyphs above and beyond character
    set standards are included in \"Pro\" fonts, and are intended to be used for professional
    and commercial publishing. This means additional punctuation, common ideograph
    variants, a rich set of Latin glyphs, to include a full set of italic forms (made
    accessible through the 'ital' GSUB feature), and so on. We have yet to define
    Supplements for our Chinese and Korean character collections that can be considered
    \"Pro\" level, and when time permits, that is something that I plan to do. Curiously,
    Adobe-GB1-5 defines 30,284 glyphs (CIDs 0 through 30283), but fonts based on this
    character collection are still designated as \"Std\" fonts, because the collection
    of glyphs is primarily based on character set standards, specifically GB 18030-2005.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    some font developers apparently have other criteria for designating their CJK
    fonts as \"Pro,\" such as Apple for their Chinese fonts that are based on GB 18030-2005.
    Their criteria is based solely on the number of glyphs. I find this to be a poor
    criteria, because the threshold is highly subjective. The criteria that I briefly
    described in the previous paragraph represents a much more practical and useful
    criteria for using the \"Pro\" designation for CJK fonts.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior

  body: "In Adobe's terms, Helvetica Std is a \"Std\" font even though it includes
    Western+Cyrillic (but no CE). Though I must admit such cases are rare. In the
    vast majority of cases, \"Pro\" does indicates \"the character set beyond Windows
    Western, with at least Central European Latin diacritics included\". Typotheque
    sets the bar higher, as their Std fonts do include CE glyphs as well (but their
    Pro includes also Cyrillic and Greek). \r\n\r\nURW++ has a more elaborate scheme
    that involves \"L1\", \"L1.5\" and \"L2\" character sets. I somehow agree that
    there is a need for a term to describe the Western-only fonts (\"Std\" is OK here)
    but then there is also a need for two different terms, one to denote the Latin-only
    multilingual fonts (i.e. extended character coverage within one writing system),
    and another to describe fonts that offer more than that (Cyrillic, Greek and other
    alphabets, potentially).\r\n\r\nFor my internal purposes, I've adapted the optional
    \"Basic\" vs. \"Plus\"/\"Extended\" suffix. An \"Std Basic\" font would really
    be just the Western codepage, an \"Std Plus\" or \"Std Extended\" font would have
    small caps, oldstyle numerals, extra ligatures or perhaps swashes, but still only
    for the Western characters, a \"Pro Basic\" font would offer Western and Central
    European diacritics, and perhaps some alternate glyphs for those, but no Cyrillic
    or Greek, while \"Pro Plus\" or \"Pro Extended\" would mean an open-ended font
    with at least two writing systems supported (one other than Latin). \r\n\r\nBut
    then again, once you start making those finer distinctions, you can never stop,
    and also, there is no way to \"standardize\" those terms across vendors (not that
    I would think such standardization is necessary). \r\n\r\nA."

    Pro fonts tell you what is in each font, so having separate names for each potential
    suite of glyph sets or options is near pointless. Super-Pro or Mega-Pro or Premier
    Pro all imply better than pro, so as long as the features and range of glyphs
    can be referenced, having a specific name industry wide is not needed.\r\n\r\n"

    have figured out that small caps will not work if you select a whole sentence
    before a line break. If you select a few letters or words in the middle of a sentence,
    the small caps feature will work as expected. I have tested this in Pages 08,
    too, getting the same symptoms. Interestingly, in TextEdit everything works fine.\r\n\r\nSmall
    caps problems are not limited to iWork though: In the invoicing application I
    use, Billings 2.5, the small caps in my self-made template are broken, but as
    Adam Twardoch pointed out here: [[http://www.typophile.com/node/37122]], this
    is due to a change in the way small caps are marked up in the RTF file format
    that Mac OS uses. Needless to say that Keynote has also forgotten all the small
    caps formatting, probably because of this issue.\r\n\r\nSo apparently there are
    at least two different small caps problems: Apps forgetting smcp formatting and
