  Thork</a> family is released and  available at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/jana-thork/\">MyFonts</a>!\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis
  type family can be seen as a historical approach that considers our increasing needs
  for freedom in a post-historical world. Jana Thork is a synthesis of the stone engraved
  capital letterforms and the uncial and half-uncial calligraphic styles.\r\n\r\nThe
  idea of the typeface designer, Ricardo Esteves Gomes, was to seek the limits between
  our uppercase and lowercase mental concepts. In this respect, it unites references
  from both Roman and Celtic cultures in one place.\r\n\r\nThe Jana Thork family includes
  more than 120 extras including ligatures and swashes. If you want to use open type
  features you can see them all (ligatures, swashes and fractions) in one font file,
  that is Jana Thork Pro.\r\n\r\nThis family can be useful to compose titles, short
  texts and letterings that need to look attractive to the eye.\r\n\r\n--"

    swashes are lovely! :)
