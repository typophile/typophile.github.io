body: "The software \u2014 rapid application development, or RAD \u2014 was originally
  called WebRADE (RADE = rapid application development environment). Shortened it
  down, and focused on its speed at developing apps and its robustness.\r\n\r\nIt's
  for quickly developing apps that can access a variety of databases and is easy for
  non-programmers to use. It's also tied in to Autodesk MapGuide, allowing for use
  of map and GIS info to provide particularly robust applications.\r\n\r\nI wanted
  to capture the three dimensions, speed, and effectiveness. I also wanted to avoid
  anything too complex so it can represent the company in light of Oracle, Autodesk,
  et al.\r\n\r\nAny comments?\r\n.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RADE_Logo_3444.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "It has something of a movie poster. Especially the 'R'. Not sure if that
    reflects the IT environment. That is what I miss. Seeing this, I don't see something
    of IT. It could \u2013 like I said \u2013 be a title for a movie, or a book. But
    software? No.\r\n;-)\r\n\r\nI do like the treatment> Type becomes interesting
    very quickly this way. But that shouldn't be a goal in itself.\r\nIf you could
    add something IT it would benefit from that.\r\n\r\n@all about seb: couldn't one
    read this as a wide field (it has to fall a bit more backwards). Possibilities?
    Base?\r\n\r\nHope this helps\r\n\r\nWhat about colors?\r\n"

  body: "I kept the horizon equal to eye-level to maintain depth, three dimensions.
    Keeping with the idea that in photography/cinematography, when the subject is
    above, it diminishes viewer's posture. When the viewer's perspective is from above,
    it empowers the viewer. This offers a bit of depth towards-beneath the viewer.
    Which hopefully adds a bit to the idea of the GIS/CAD capabilities of the software.\r\n\r\nIt's
    geospatial features is part of what differentiates it from its competition.\r\n\r\nGetting
    away from the stereotypical IT elements, I want to convey a bit more dynamism.
    It's not being marketed to IT departments per se, but to departments, execs, and
    persons with very basic database knowledge. Because it is a \"rapid application
    development\" environment, the point is that almost anyone can easy prototype
    and create solutions instead of relying on software developers and consultants.\r\n\r\nOr
    so I am shooting for\u2026 =]\r\n\r\nAs for colour, we'll be working with a green
    hue. This is a strategic decision in light of competition primarily using reds.\r\n\r\nI
    appreciate the feedback so far, though. Thanks! Keep offering insight!"

  body: "I've done a lot of work for IT companies. Most would convey speed through
    a generically dull swoosh of some form or other.\r\n\r\nI actually really like
    what you've done. It stands out within the tech sector (especially in green) and
    it conveys depth, speed, movement, robustness and authority but is still a lovely
    and simple mark.\r\n\r\nSomething about the E bothers me slightly though...it
    just seems like its rotating a bit and lifting off the ground - the bottom looks
    like its coming toward me. Is it just me? "

    of the A with the vertical stroke of the E.  They seem to conflict.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    very nice.  Just needs some tweaking.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    making sure it's something that contrasts equally well against Oracle and is usable
    in rgb, cmyk, and has a Pantone equivalent.\r\n\r\nIf any major updates happen
    soon, I'll post em. Working on www UI currently, so I test it out on biz cards
    and on web this week, we'll see it being used practically and can make accurate
    calls on its use. =]"
