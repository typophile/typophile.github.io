  that basically gives a timeline of fonts and typefaces from the year 1950 - 2000.\r\n\r\nMy
  goal is to find 5 fonts from each decade between these years and outline a basic
  history of each. (50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, and a year 2000 page)\r\n\r\nThis
  is not a commercial endeavor - however, depending on the final product, it could
  be. As such, if you provide me with a link, an article, etc. that helps me accomplish
  this goal, I will include your name in an Acknowledgements section.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help! I will be scanning the finished book upon completion so you can see."

    has a lot of the information you seem to be looking for in one place. Do you have
    access to a copy?
