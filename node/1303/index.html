		<div class="commentbody">Yes, a work is coprighted at the moment of it&#39;s creation. but maximum protection is only extended to registered copyrights. In the U.S. you register  with the US copyright office at:  <BR><a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/" target="_blank">http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/</a> . $30 would cover the cost of a registration of a single image of suite of images. My knowledge of copyright law is a result of my volunteer time spent with the Graphic Artists Guild. While I&#39;ve never registered a website, I have registered many images. The process is similar. <BR> <BR>Mailing a copy to yourself, or &#34;schoolyard copyright&#34; proves nothing in a court of law, except that you mailed it to yourself. It&#39;s worthless as far as protecting your interests. This wives tale will still be around long after the postal service has gone out of business. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s why registration is worthwhile: <BR> <BR>In the event of an infringement, an unregistered copyright creator would probably search for a lawyer to take his/her case. In court, the holder would then need to prove the damages the infringer inflicted, and would be eligible for actual damages. Not many lawyers would take that case, because the return would be so small..., and more difficult to bring to court. In the end, this person would likely just mail a cease and desist letter without any teeth to back it up and hope the infringer does the right thing. <BR> <BR>In the event the </div>
