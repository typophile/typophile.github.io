body: So I'm doing my first ever project with InDesign and there's one thing that
  is bugging me. When I'm active in a text box/frame, whatever you call it, and I
  input my copy I can't seem to find a way to exit 'Text entry' mode. ESC, Enter,
  Return...none of those work. I have to go over to the toolbar and manually click
  on a different tool. I'd much rather just hit a button and go about my business.
  Does this make sense? I'm sure there has to be a way to do this.

  body: I have a set of shortcuts, am I just overlooking the command to 'verify' my
    added copy? Basically what I'm saying is that the normal toolbar shortcuts like
    'V' or 'A' for selection tools doesn't work when I have the text tool selected
    'T' It's rather hard to explain such a simple concept.

    'A' or whatever you want.

    specifically noted: \r\n\"I\u2019d much rather just hit a button and go about
    my business\".\r\n\r\nSo telling him to click away first, and giving him a list
    of shortcuts which are plainly useless, is NOT going to help him. This is the
    exact thing he DOESN'T WANT TO DO.\r\n\r\ndavid, Manlio's idea works well: Command/CTRL
    + Shift + A."

  body: Hmm never thought about that. It's not assigned to do anything else like cancel
    accidental input, like in Quark? (If my memory serves me right as of this moment...rather
    tired) What command is it called to 'verify input'?

    can modify. :^) I think that is the beauty of being able to customize, it fits
    what you do most and what you use most.

    to wrap my head around the program. Any general tips you wish you knew when you
    started using it? Other than Keyboard Shortcuts..I found a PDF of those.

    tips/shortcuts which you may already know;\r\n\r\n* If you're fussy like me, set
    your ideal workspace (onscreen layout of tools and panels) and save it under the
    windows tab so when things get a bit messy, you can load your saved workspace.
    I wish I'd learned this earlier.\r\n* Hit W to toggle between preview (hides grid/guides/bleeds
    etc.) and working spaces.\r\n* Make sure your colour profiles are synchronised
    between all suite programs (Illustratior/InDesign/Photoshop) so you don't get
    any surprises when you throw something in. In CS2, there is a suite colour sync
    feature that is very useful.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n\r\n:-)"

  body: "Ever needed to switch to the Selection tool while you\u2019re working inside
    a text frame? Or what if you want to draw a new frame somewhere else on the page.
    You can\u2019t tap the shortcut V for the Selection tool or F for the Rectangle
    Frame tool while you\u2019re working inside a text frame or you will wind up adding
    the letters V and F to your text. Yes, you can deselect and then press those keys,
    but the savvy InDesign user can do the following:\r\n\r\nChoose Edit Keyboard
    Shortcuts and switch the Product Area to Tools. Then scroll down to find the tool
    you need a new shortcut for. Click inside the New Shortcut field and with the
    Context as Text, type the shortcut you want. Make sure you use a modifier key
    such as Cmd (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) and then a letter. For instance, I use Cmd-Opt-Shift-V
    for the Selection tool. Then, you will have two different shortcuts. The single
    letter can be used when you\u2019re outside a text frame, and the longer one when
    you\u2019re inside the frame.\r\n\r\n<em>\u2014 This week's tip was provided by
    Jamie McKee.</em>\r\n\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.theindesignconference.com/\">The
    Indesign Conference</a> Tip of the Week."

    type tool, holding down the command key will give you the direct selection tool
    back, click the mouse wherever your cursor is and hit the letter to activate the
    new tool. I don't know if this works on PCs but I imagine so. If you want to zoom
    or move the workarea you can use command+space or option (alt) respectively, releasing
    them will return you to the text tool.\r\nNo more trips to the pesky menu, until
    you forget what the shortcut is:)\r\nTim"

    big application.\r\n\r\nBecause my use tends towards type, I've become happier
    thAN EVER with a type tool that lets you out*, when you want to stay with the

    document to a 13\" square, and then each time I create a new document , change
    the format from portrait to landscape to make sure nothing happens.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the controls on the underscore are phenomenal. defining the underscore as a squiggly
    line, for example, can be done to avoid those nasty descenders, and it is now
    a breeze.\r\n:)"
