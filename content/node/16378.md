body: I've recently changed the Typophile Tracker page to my home page, as it is much
  much easier to keep up with the board than it was before. I noticed that when there
  are new posts in a topic it has a little link below the post count saying '# new.'
  When I click on this new posts link though, I would expect to be brought to the
  new posts, is this incorrect? I guess I'm used to other forums that have features
  like this (enter post at last read). Thanks!

    new</em> link if the post is on the first page... for threads with over 50 posts
    you always go to the first page instead of the new posts.\r\n\r\nI still haven't
    figured out why some of the posts get red asterisks."

    is not always the case. I thought it was when there were posts in the thread which
    you have not read but there are times when there is no red mark but still new
    posts! I don't get it either.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
