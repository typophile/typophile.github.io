body: I'm having trouble identifying the font in the small (sorry) attached image.
  I know I've seen/used it on posters, however my search to find the face has come
  up empty. Thoughts?

  body: I apologize for the size of the imgt. The shapes are spot on to your suggestion,
    however, knowing the text in the picture is vinyl, I know the letters are solid.
    Know of one like that, but without the grunge?

  body: "If the letters is vinyl, there is a possibility this would not be a standard
    TrueType or OpenType digital font.\r\nMany manufacturers of vinyl cutters and
    large scale printers create their own OEM fonts, which are vector fonts in a non-standard
    custom format. See for example the [[http://www.gspinc.com/default.asp?contentID=56|Gerber
    System]] which uses custom Gerber Fonts (.gsf).\r\nMost of these fonts are exact
    copies of standard commercial outline fonts, but some of them are modified to
    be more suitable for a specific application like e.g. vinyl cutting or engraving.\r\n"
