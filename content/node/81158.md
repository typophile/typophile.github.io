  I don't have a horse in this race. Well, I'm a designer; I want to make good web

    per-project pricing would be relevant, in order to better charge the final client.\r\n\r\nAs
    a type designer (www.vtf.fadebiaye.com) and an occasional website designer, I
    prefer free fonts (free as in free-speech), because it's more convenient, that's
    all."

  body: "Been using http://www.fontsquirrel.com/ and http://www.google.com/webfonts,
    @font-face, no-Javascript. With the resources available to me, \"free\" is a mightily
    attractive option. My concerns with that are two-fold: (1) quality of available
    fonts, and (2) being able to sleep well at night, knowing that I haven't taken
    anything from type designers that they weren't already giving away (see [[http://www.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Cabin|Cabin]]).\r\n\r\nWell,
    and there's always (3) availability of the client-specified font(s) for embedding.
    When they insist on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-eras/|Eras]],
    or [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/honeymoon|Honeymoon]]...\r\n\r\nWhen
    embedding any-font-you-darn-well-please becomes too easy, we're going to see some
    God-awful web designs using too many typefaces and horribad mismatches. But that's
    a risk I'm willing to live with to put the tools for good typography into the
    hands of responsible web developers.\r\n\r\nSo, with WebINK, are we closer? Or
    is this just another more-of-the-same also-ran?"

    is also a place to consider.\r\nStormType Foundry included web option by default
    for his print licencee (http://www.stormtype.com/web_fonts.php)\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    with WebInk, clearly, we are closer."

  body: "Speaking for myself and the WebINK team, I can say that we care about quality
    fonts and typography; personally, I've been a Typophile regular a lot longer than
    WebINK has existed.\r\n\r\nThe world of web fonts is kind of a wild west frontier,
    but we're doing our part to help settle it. Some examples of things that are already
    public: engaging in W3C web font standards discussions, making showcase pages
    showing nice usage of web fonts, recording minimum pixel sizes for all our specific
    fonts, inventing the FontFuse system (where users can submit font combinations
    and vote on other people's combinations). Of course there are some other things
    we are working on that I can't yet talk about.  :)\r\n\r\nThere are some issues
    still being wrestled with for web fonts, and of course any web font system can
    be misused. But we do draw a line on font quality, for example: there are foundries
    and fonts I have turned down, or deliberately chosen not to approach, because
    of concerns about spacing, outline quality, or the like. There's one foundry who
    we signed a contract with some months ago, but are waiting to see some reworking
    on their fonts to deal with concerns about outline quality.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    \"free\" is great, and we aren't really trying to compete with that. Instead we
    offer a bigger selection, and better quality, at a reasonable price. (Don't get
    me wrong, there are some fabulous free fonts out there, but one has to be pretty
    savvy to avoid the drek.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nThomas"
