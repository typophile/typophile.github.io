  point me at the correct font?\r\n\r\nIt's at least 20 years old.  This is a shot
  of all the characters I could scrounge up.  They may appear a bit softer in this
  sample than they actually are since this is an enlargement.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nChris\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unknownfont_4350.jpg]"

  body: "Except for a couple of characters, it looks very similar to Raleigh Gothic:
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/raleigh-gothic/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/raleigh-gothic-rr/\r\n\r\nModern
    releases of this font are based on the original by Morris Fuller Benton, done
    in the 1930s. Perhaps what you're looking at is from an older specimen.\r\n\r\nThat
    may not be correct, but at least it's a starting point.\r\n\r\nBest of luck.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks.\r\n\r\nI spotted Titling Gothic, as well as <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/placard_condensed\">Placard
    Condensed</a> yesterday.  Placard Condensed seemed to have the low riding crossbar
    on the \"A\" as well as the angled \"M\" legs, but missed in a few other areas
    like the \"J\" and the corner radii of some of the other characters.\r\n\r\nThe
    font I'm looking for may have come from an Apple Mac in the late 80's, possibly
    with Adobe Illustrator.\r\n\r\nI like to match this font more closely for a graphic.
    \ I'm sort of new at font matching; what is the likelyhood of me finding a more
    accurate match?  Should I just take one of the above fonts and start modifying
    it?\r\n\r\nI haven't modified a font in 15 years.  If that's the route I have
    to go, is there an editor that I can bring a background graphic into and sort
    of trace over it for accuracy?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nChris\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you only need the font for a few characters, I would just modify one of
    the available fonts. You might spend more time looking for the exact font than
    it would take to just modify one that you have.\r\n\r\nYou can use Illustrator
    to do this:\r\n\r\n1) Place your graphic on a background layer\r\n2) Set your
    text using an existing font\r\n3) Convert the text to outlines\r\n4) Adjust as
    necessary\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-capture_4149.jpg]"
