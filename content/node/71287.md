body: "I'm writing a textbook for middle school students studying English as a foreign
  language. It's a speaking workbook, and for such a book to be useful, it needs a
  substantial teacher's edition. But I have so many questions about how to implement
  this!\r\n\r\n1. I have 6 types of information that need to be added to form the
  teacher's edition. These include short answers, paragraphs, and tables.  On most
  pages there's enough extra text that if I assigned all the teacher components a
  common design feature, like italics or boxes or a different type, it would look
  very strange. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n2. With different text the teacher's edition doesn't
  quite match with the student edition; however I can make each lesson (2-4 pages)
  be the same amount in each version. Is that good enough?\r\n\r\n3. a question about
  the answer space itself. I used dotted lines for short answers, and big blank space
  for notes. That makes the most sense instructionally, but looks awful. What can
  I do?\r\n\r\n4. how is the type and general layout? I'm using Palatino in LaTeX
  with the memoir class, on a4 paper. I think it looks very raggedy on the left. I'm
  thinking I should increase the margins and make subsection headings more distinctive..?\r\n\r\n5.
  Artwork is not planned, but I want to liven it up a bit for the kids. Ideas? And,
  I have the option to make all the numbered questions continuous throughout a lesson.
  Should I?\r\n\r\nThank you very much! I've never designed anything on this scale
  before, nor have I used LaTeX, so this is a big challenge. PS, the sample (textbook.pdf)
  should be viewed in 2-page mode, because the versions are side by side, and the
  first page is filler. I also included toefl.pdf, which is a draft (with much less
  text) in the style of tufte's books. I rejected this because the margins had limited
  utility, but am rethinking this."

  body: Clace, is this textbook just for your own students, or is it something you
    plan to sell commercially? If it's a commercial product you really need to work
    with a professional graphic designer.
