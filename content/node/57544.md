  that his bit on Times New Roman was set with a cut that\u2019s more extended. I
  began to wonder if anybody had digitized this particular variant of TNR.\r\n\r\nI
  quickly found out that nobody did, but that wasn\u2019t the point. This observation
  also sparked a little conversation on Twitter:\r\n\r\n\u201CThere was a lovely cut
  [of TNR] that a US company issued in PS1 around 1990,\u201D my friend <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jackyan/statuses/1656958315\">Jack
  Yan</a> said. It was \u201Cweightier, but it wasn\u2019t Times Ten.\u201D\r\n\r\nI
  did a sleuth around the web, and found further that Times Millenium, Times Classic
  and Times Modern (all designed for the newspaper when it redesigned) was only released
  internally. There are also the Europa, Ten and Seven variant, but these didn\u2019t
  match Jack\u2019s criteria for the face he saw in the \u201990s\r\n\r\nI wonder
  if anyone with a knowledge of TNR\u2019s history can advise on this subject?"
