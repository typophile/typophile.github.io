		<div class="commentbody">According to Martin Kotulla, I think SoftMaker is finally creating an all-new exclusive typeface design, an actual clone of Doyald Young&rsquo;s best-known script typeface (recently released as Home Run Script-roman), which is called &ldquo;H785 Script&rdquo; (numbered from Homer, featuring both the uppercase and lowercase character sets, the same as Home Run Script-roman; however, the numbers look quite original, the @/at symbol is not inverted, and that the Euro Symbol and some math symbols look different, although the rest of the characters have their glyphs kept intact).   This font name is appearing on both the &ldquo;MegaFont XXL 3.0&rdquo; and &ldquo;infiniType 4&rdquo; premium-quality typeface collections from SoftMaker, which were both being released around May 27, 2014.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Eric, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beautiful and ambitious! I like it. The style seems consistent and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for the most part well done. I'm also a large admirer of Doyald  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Young's work. A few comments: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Overall I think the general swash shapes are working,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Consider adding a second swash element that begins in the loop  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->below the D, parallels the other, the crosses to curl into the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->white space below the ld to improve balance. Make sense? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. The D. I'm not fond of the top curling in and the bowl curving  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in also. Consider trying the bowl crossing over the stem and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->connecting to the stems tail (echoing the y).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. The y is too narrow and poorly spaced between the o and a.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(tough to kern a pencil drawing &ndash; exacto!). Not sure the ball  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->terminal fits. Nice detail in the slight bulge on the right side. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. The modulation in the l is uncertain. Actually, the modulation  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in general is a little inconsistent, but not incredibly so. It's the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->danger of drawing a script with a pencil. You have to know  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exactly how you'd draw it with a pen or brush. I know Young  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->uses a pencil for his scripts, as did Benguiat when he drew  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edwardian Script. I don't have this expertise, but something  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->seems off. Try to picture the draw of the nib as you apply  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pressure down and release going up, and the angle that your  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrist can feasibly make, will it take one or two strokes etc&hellip; Did  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you have a model you were working from? Kinda sounded like  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you chose not to. Even if it's not close look at something to sure  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->up your modulation.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. Maybe wrap the top of the d a little more to echo the swash tail. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are some flat curves in here, but that can be remidied. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This kind of thing is really tough. I'm impressed. I notice you are  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in LA, is this a class for Doyald? Looking forward to seeing the final. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's a huge improvement. And it was excellent to start with. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So here are my two bits: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first D is sloped too far. It looks to me like it's being forced out of the way by the y's swashing tail. Which isn't very nice. It also very closely resembles an infinite symbol. Try straightening the stem a bit and raising the intersection point.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, I have to point out just how phallic the D in your first effort is. You might want to save that for a more provocative typeface. Perhaps titled &quot;ID&quot; or &quot;Freudian Thoughts.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bottom of the bowel of the second &quot;d&quot; begins to thicken too soon and too fast compared to the &quot;a.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe thicken the second arm of the &quot;y.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gorgeous script. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Personally, I prefer the second floating swash (if anyone knows a name more proper, please inform my ignorance of it).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was just wondering if you couldn't use the shape of the D from the first picture to drop down into that swash. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, the first picture does have more focus on the word itself.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Eric, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a matter of personal taste I actually prefer the original post. It's unusual to see a low(er) contrast, formal script. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking at formal scripts that include swashes and flourishes, is seems the lower case in particular is pretty locked in it's modulation axis. The caps have a bit more variation as needed, and the flourishes often vary considerably. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example in your 11/7 2:59 post, the flourishes seem to follow the axis of the roman too much yielding too much up and down motion. The original brings more horizontal push which is nice. Also in this example, the one-sided a and one-sided l look week in combination. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Basically, I'd go back to your original drawing, and focus on: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Getting the D to feel comfortable. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. The y wider, as in later versions, but make sure the right is thin (!) swelling smoothly, but quickly at the end to finish (more like the teardrop, just finishing in a point) &ndash; I'd keep it at x-height too). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. Working on the l. Understanding that the orignal style is quite different that what I'm about to point too, I still think this form could work (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hogarth<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Note how it doesn't actually connect as yours does, it begins higher. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One other note, I think generally, the thicks in your flourishes should be slightly thinner than the thicks in the text. Put the emphasis on the word. See Bickham for example. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh, and I agree that the second flourish is a little busy. Keep pushing! I applaud you for sticking to a pencil and your brain. It lets an idea remain an idea and not straight jacket you into a bad idea because it looks &quot;final.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->R</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eric <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The D in the 8:31 post looks much more dignified now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant is right about the 'a' and 'o' becoming too similar. However, I think flattening (or cutting diagonal) the top of the a's stem while bringing the point slightly closer would fix it. I'm looking at your first drawing which doesn't seem to have the problem. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not sure why Randy doesn't like the 'y' going above x-height. It increases the y's character, in my opinion. I'd even suggest raising the left side too. But you do need to carry a thicker stroke out of the arm of the 'y' so the left side arm runs into the right side. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like Randy's suggestion for the 'l.' It does look more standard than the other letters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the 8:42 post: the D is so much more original to me. I was thinking that besides straightening the stem, the first D would do better to not have the top wrap in on itself. I know everything else is more round, but it becomes much more recognizable if the top of the D goes back straighter, with only a slight curve. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The D is definitely worth another try or two. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My preference is still for the second flourish and the 8:42 post is intriguing to me. That post is also a good reminder of why kerning is so important with scripts. It reminds me of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Walg reens<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I have to pass everyday on my route to work. But that's for the Critique Board. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, we're coming at you from all angles here. I'd be more willing to give up the second flourish if the original D, with changes, slipped back into the picture. To my eyes, with the work you're basing this off of, the thins increase Doyald's elegance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for all the comments from everyone. even though I'm not sure I agree with everything (nor do the different opinions agree with each other), it has given me a lot to think about and try. I'm going to try at least one more version before my class today at 5:30. I'll try to do 2 if I can. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I really like the simplicity of just one flourish beneath the word; I've tried adding a second one two seperate times, and I wasn't happy with it, so I'm going to stick to one. Also, I think I prefer the original D, or some modification of it. Since I'm not truly designing a font here (more of a logo, I guess) I think I can take certain liberties with the characters.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I should have another version in an hour or 2 <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eric</div>

		<div class="commentbody">here's version #4 <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think this is the direction I want to move in; I preferred the original D, with 2 seperate strokes, and I like having more of a flourish to it. I think it balances out the flourish on the other side, which extends past the lc &quot;d&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the y is improved; the angle is more consistent with the other letters and the right arm transitions better into the flourish. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The a is pretty good, looks much more like an a than an o, and the weight on the right side is more consistent with the d. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not sure about the l. I tried to straighten the left stroke and bulge out the right one. I liked that about the Hobart l. I think the bulge on the right size echoes the ascender of the d as well. I still wanted the l to connect to the a, though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The D could probably still use some finessing. Overall, though I think this version is close to what I am going for. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->whew&hellip;time to go to class. keep comments coming, though because I plan to keep working on it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eric <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I love it. My eyes just float around and around it, like a roller coaster. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm glad you stuck with the D. The angle of its stem no longer bothers me and it fits so much better with the rest of the script. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The real problem is that 'l.' The thick side needs to curve more. It's too straight compared to the 'd' and the flourishes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That is a simple solution. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd also like to suggest to you a more drastic change with the 'l.' The first example I found was <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Roundhand<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Mr. Snell and Mr. Carter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, that's not the best example for this script, but if the 'l' became just a simple solid curve, matching the 'd' but slightly flatter, I think it would compliment your script. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think you're doing a wonderful job of taking suggestions from us while finding solutions of your own. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DeWitt</div>
