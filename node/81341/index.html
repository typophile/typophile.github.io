If the font lacks a minus, use the nearest thing to it, which will usually be the en dash. If it's noticeably different from the ideal length, you can scale it!

The substitution of a hyphen only started to happen with monospaced typewriters and computers. Bringing that habit back to a proportional face is bad practice. In most text faces a hyphen is rather too small and can get overlooked. No matter what the context, the difference between a negative number and a positive one is going to be important enough that it <em>should</em> break the color of a body of text.</div>

@dtw:

This is one symptom of a larger problem.

In Latin-alphabet languages other than English, things are made worse by the need to accommodate accented letters on the conventional keyboard. But even on the English-language keyboard, several character positions make sense for computer programming only. They don't even make sense for "word processing"... business document typing, which used to be monospaced, but which, even with a proportional typestyle, is <em>not</em> typesetting.

An English-language keyboard, thus, for use in the U.S. environment, ought to be switchable into a "word processing" mode, where the following characters get substituted on the keys:

~ is replaced by ± 
` is replaced by º
< is replaced by ¶
> is replaced by §
| is replaced by ¼
\ is replaced by ½
{ is replaced by £
} is replaced by ¾
^ is replaced by ¢

For <em>typesetting</em> mode, it is necessary to replace the underscore with the em-dash, to make † and ‡ accessible, and, ideally, ⅛, ⅜, ⅝, and ⅞ as well. (One doesn't need @ and # in that mode, which will help a little - ~ and ` can also have their substitutes changed. That's still two characters short, but the European keyboard <em>does</em> have one extra key...)

And, as I've noted, for typesetting, the keyboard really should provide small capitals as a third shift, which would require turning Unicode upside down, as small capitals are not currently recognized as a "case".

If one is going to use a special symbol for minus, however, one has (in however much of a small way) entered into the domain of the typesetting of mathematics. At this point, one has reached a level at which "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here" or at least "May God have mercy on your soul" seems like the appropriate comment.

Thus, while it is already foolish to hope that Windows (<em>or even the Mac</em>, which at least does offer special characters with an alt shift on its default keyboard) might someday offer "US English - Word Processing" and "US English - Typesetting" alternate keyboard layouts... making the math stuff handy goes beyond that.

Not that it's impossible; after all, keyboards that looked like this

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scadet_6089.gif]

(this is a drawing I made for my web page, so as to avoid rights questions; there are [[http://world.std.com/~jdostale/kbd/SpaceCadet.htm|photographs]] of this keyboard on the web as well, if you would like to see the real thing) existed, and there are the three keyboard layouts for the IBM Selectric Composer for Mathematical Greek, Mathematical and Technical elements, and various mathematical keyboard layouts for photocomposition machines... but we don't even get the APL layout offered to us as standard.</div>

Of course, improved input systems as you refered are welcome. A perfect keyboard would have dynamic light-identified keys, which change with target use, as one already can do with some UI. An idea to 2021, maybe.</div>

I'm not sure that such a device, appealing though it is, is actually the answer. Integration with the operating system is more important, for example.

Here is an illustration of how a U.S. keyboard could integrate the ordinary word processing and typesetting layouts, if it took the ANSI layout further, in order to more strictly follow the old typewriter style of layout:

Plain: `1234567890-=   qwertyuiop[]\   asdfghjkl;'   zxcvbnm,./
Shift: ~!@#$%^&*()_+   QWERTYUIOP{}|   ASDFGHJKL:"   ZXCVBNM<>?

Opt/shift: `⁄€‹›ﬁﬂ‡°·‚—±   Œ„´‰ˇÁ¨ˆØ∏”’»   ÅÍÎÏ˝ÓÔÒÚÆ   ¸˛Ç◊ı˜Â¯˘¿

It is possible, with the option key, to type most common special characters for the Latin alphabet (other than special typesetter's spaces) if you know the keystrokes involved. En dash, for instance, is opt+hyphen. Accents work as follows:

á = opt+e; then a

Some other commonly used typographic symbols — I have these memorized from frequent use:

em dash — opt+shift+hyphen
ellipsis … opt+semicolon
midpoint · opt+shift+9
bullet • opt+8
Spanish question ¿ opt+shift+question
Spanish exclamation ¡ opt+1
aesc æ opt+comma
oethel œ opt+q

There are a few other InDesign-specific ones, like cmd+n for an en space and cmd+m for an em space.

Bringhurst, by the way, proposes a method of combining opt/shift keys to cover all characters needed for (I believe) all uses of the Latin alphabet in European languages, plus a few additional characters.

Oh, and to address the original topic of this thread, I use an en dash for minus, with spaces on either side if in an equation, without spaces if for a single negative number.

That might make sense under some conditions - under which the * and / keys on the numeric keypad ought to insert U+00D7 (×) and U+00F7 (÷) respectively too. The trouble, of course, is determining when those conditions apply.

Under <em>normal</em> conditions, it would be extremely confusing for the keyboard to generate anything outside of the conventional ASCII range from U+0000 to U+007F from any key which could plausibly be associated with a character within that range. Of course, defining "normal" conditions as typing text into Notepad, Programmer's File Editor, or gedit for input into, say, a FORTRAN compiler <em>may</em> seem to some as being perverse these days...

Oh, and I even have a cute little reference chart of the extra characters on the Macintosh:
