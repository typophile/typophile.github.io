body: "Does anyone know of any high-quality fonts exemplifying the two styles of German
  handwriting known as \"deutsche Kurrentschrift\" and \"S\xFCtterlin(schrift)\"?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThey
  are depicted in columns 2 (\"Kurrent\") and 3 (\"S\xFCtterlin\") [[http://www.kurrentschrift.eu/index.php?s=alphabet&l=abisg&r=kur1|here]].
  (On the right one can click oneself through to see the letters H-Z as well.)\r\n\r\nI
  tried the fonts \"1880 Kurrentshrift Normal\" [misspelled!] and \"Suetterlin\" from
  MyFonts.com, but these fonts turned out to not quite be what I expected: Upon closer
  inspection, the connections between letters are not perfectly continuous or not
  even correct (for example, the d-e connection, which ought to appear as shown [[http://www.kurrent.de/_html/schreibschrift.htm|here]]).
  (I inspected the OpenType versions of these fonts, and OpenType is powerful enough
  a format to have such issues addressed correctly. So an expert I asked suggested
  that OpenType might have been used merely as a wrapper for a simpler format in these
  cases. In any case, these fonts are not satisfactory.) Then, [[http://www.schriftarten-fonts.de/fonts/13035/s__tterlin_font.html|another
  free font I found on the web]] doesn't have the long-s/short-s (\u017F/s) distinction
  that is required in these styles of writing.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a professional
  font that gets all these things right."

  body: "Many thanks for all replies!\r\n\r\nI have checked all pointers. Without
    wanting to name specific foundries, I found that all fonts I have seen have one
    or more of the following issues:\r\n<li>Short-s characters are rendered as long-s
    glyphs; there is no long-short s distinction.\r\n<li>The fonts are designed to
    avoid the high-low connector distinction. I would certainly like to see a font
    that makes such a distinction (pay attention to the connection after \"b\"/\"d\"/\"r\"/\"t\").\r\n<li>The
    letter connections aren't perfectly smooth. Seemingly all fonts I looked at suffered
    from this problem, so I guess this really is hard to solve.\r\n<li>Kerning isn't
    always quite right.\r\n<li>The fonts are Type 1 fonts (instead of for instance
    OpenType) with a homemade encoding.\r\n\r\nIf a font got only the latter two points
    not right, I'd take it, but each font I explored suffered from at least one of
    the first two points.\r\n\r\nIn summary, none of the fonts I explored were to
    my satisfaction. Nonetheless thanks for your help! I think handwriting fonts are
    especially tricky to get right."

  body: Thanks for the feedback. This confirms my expectations/suspicions. However,
    most of the fonts that I looked at do at least offer glyphs both for the long
    and the short s, and the inclusion of a set of ligatures is common as well. You
    have to input the exceptions manually, or rely on some converter. The problem
    is that these alternates are not properly encoded and not accessible via OpenType
    features. I guess this genre is just too obscure and unprofitable to attract the
    attention of professional typeface designers.

    body: Only one font of those I seriously investigated seemed to not offer a long-short
      s distinction. Either way, I agree with what you're saying.
