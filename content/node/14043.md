body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nA friend of mine needs to refine his logo fairly quickly.  \r\nHe
  has a small fashion label in Los Angeles.  He describes the clothing line as Afro-Metropolitian.
  \ The clothes and tailoring are very high end, but his current logo does not match
  the garments.\r\n\r\nThe logo is still up in the air, but I am sure that he wants
  some kind of signature as the type.  \r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in a quick
  turn around project please send a design sample and contact information to alexander.derrick@adventure.com\r\n\r\n-Bookie"
