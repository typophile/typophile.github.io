  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, everyone. This is my first foray into typeface design. I've designed this for a class I'm taking.

It is inspired by Frutiger. My idea was to add an arc to the ascenders and an opposite arc to the descenders to create a sense of movement. I've felt that sometimes sans serifs are too static and could use a little excitement. 

I appreciate any constructive criticism you can offer.

Thanks,
Doug</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Two problems you might have:

1. There is already a typeface called <a href="http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=87">Dalliance</a>.

2. It's considered unethical to use the outlines of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/myriad_pro_regular/&sample_text=sans%20arc&sample_size=110">another font</a> to create your own.

I think you have some interesting ideas with the stroke endings, but you need to build your typeface from scratch.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To me it looks like Frutiger created on a bad press. I like the little flashes but don't think they're suitable on a font like this. Frutiger was designed for legibility - Charles de Gaulle Airport I think (I suspect Stephen will have more idea than me) Hence it was never intended as a font with "movement". My personal opinion is that it is deathly dull, but we suffer from a total overload of it in the UK and I'm using it on a particularly uninspring project at the moment so I'm a little biased. It is however very successful at it's job (without opening up the legibility debate AGA!N)

I think you need a more suitable typeface to "inspire" your idea.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's no fun being discouraging to a student, but I would advise running away from this as fast as you can. Besides the ethical issues, the main thing is this type of effort is boring as hell. :-/  Yes, look at existing fonts, but make your own forms from your own head - that's what makes it interesting.

That said you have a very good point concerning the static nature of most sans designs (including Frutiger). When you're making your forms from scratch try sheared/concave terminals but also experiment with a slight slant.

I wish that I could believe that, but looking specifically at the original forms of such glyphs as @ & * in Myriad, it becomes very clear that the outlines from Myriad were simply appended with little "flicks". (And this site was probably the absolute worst place to post your "first face". Folks here tend to be pretty protective when it comes to type design.)

The copying of other people's designs I can live with (I'm quite sympathetic to the copyright reformer's position, and in fact plan to do a free release of my adaptation of Bruce Rogers' Centaur soon). The lying about it, even after being confronted, not so much.

Look at it this way. If you drew this yourself or not; still, putting a hat on a kitten is not the same as making a kitten. 

I know it can be hard to see this because alot of type does look suspiciously alike to a newbie. A new serif can seem like it should 'count' - I mean what's the difference? Trust me, the differences are there. Go looking for them.  </div>

As a student of typography, you must understand from the beginning that your submission is neither "designed" or "inspired"... it is simply copied, and your embellishments add nothing to the original.

I agreee with the others, you need to explore your own resourses and come up with an original creation.
