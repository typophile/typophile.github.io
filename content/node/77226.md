  fonts such as SIL Charis, Gentium Plus, UniFraktur-Maguntia, UniFraktur-Cook and
  the Linux Libertine fonts, but Libertine now includes a Python script that supposedly
  auto-derives and builds Graphite tables from Opentype tables in Fontforge.\r\n\r\nhttp://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/typo\r\n\r\nThere
  is a apparently 2011 Google Summer of Code project to add Opentype feature access
  to OpenOffice.org, so adding Graphite to your fonts might ultimately prove unnecessary,
  but if you want advanced features in Linux or in OpenOffice now, this is one way
  to get them.\r\n\r\n\u2767J"
