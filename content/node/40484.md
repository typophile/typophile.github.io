  in the area of Chinese typography.\r\n\r\nI am on Mac osx 10.4.10 using CS2.\r\n\r\nA
  client has provided a tiff of three Chinese characters they wish to use in a logo.\r\nThe
  logo will be comprised of both english and Chinese characters.\r\n\r\nThe challenge
  is I don't know how to activate chinese fonts on my system.\r\nThey appear in my
  font menu but english characters appear when selected in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nHow
  or what do I need to do to use Chinese characters? Thanks in advance for your insights.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I do not have any experience working with Chinese fonts, but couldn't you
    select a Chinese system font and then select the characters you're going to use
    from the Glyphs palette? Window>Type>Glyphs

    Most of the big font foundries offer Chinese. However, most of them are too expensive
    in my view!\r\n\r\nWell, on the other hand - they of course contain a hell of
    a lot of characters :-))\r\n\r\n"
