body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI have encountered a rather interesting dilemma. I am creating
  a yearbook which will be distributed as a PDF. So a yearPDF... if you will.\r\n\r\nMy
  design team and I are in the process of determining typography. Right now, we're
  confused about the realm we are dealing with. Is web or print typography best suited
  for a PDF, which will be laid out like a book? Web typography seemed like the obviously
  answer to this question. However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized
  that no, this production is not the same as a website or app; that it will have
  infinitely more information and allow for greater control and viewing on the part
  of the user. I also realized that there's nothing stopping our peers from taking
  this thing to FedEx Office one night and just getting it printed for their own sentimental
  amusement. So really... the question and its answer aren't so obvious.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts or opinions?"

    If it's a long document, I doubt if most folks will print all of it, but some
    might, and many folks will certainly print portions of it, especially if they
    want their friends to autograph it and write comments.\r\n\r\nYou might want to
    consider a landscape orientation for the pages (the long dimension is the width),
    as it will fit the proportions of monitors better, and will also still work fine
    when printed. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that some laser/ink jet printers will not print
    to the paper's edge, so don't put headlines or anything else important too close
    to the page's edges. Also leave extra room on the edges that may end up bound.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's a long document full of photos and graphics, you may run into the problem
    of the PDF's file size becoming huge, so keep that in mind when designing the
    piece. "

  body: PHP can output PDF's. I. Haven't had a chance to play with it, so I have no
    idea what it can or can't do, but for large repeating tasks it sure sounds worthwhile
    investigating.

  body: "I would suggest laying out the pages in Adobe InDesign, if you have access
    to it and know how to use it. \r\n\r\nIt's the program that most professional
    graphic designers use for page layout. It gives you a great deal of typographic
    and layout control, it works well with Adobe PhotoShop  and Adobe Illustrator
    (in fact you can import native Photoshop and Illustrator files directly into your
    InDesign layout), and InDesign has the built-in ability to easily export your
    pages as a multipage PDF with complete control over image quality, resolution,
    etc. "

  body: "Thank you all for the advice! @JamesM coincidentally, my co-lead brought
    up this same concern. We are laying the book out by page, but exporting by spreads
    so the organization will be like a book, but the presentation will be screen-friendly.\r\n\r\nThat
    said: Any thought anyone on the typeface selection? I am leaning towards using
    typefaces which are screen-friendly. \r\n\r\nJD"
