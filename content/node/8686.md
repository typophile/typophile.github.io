  body: This has a calligraphic style to it, like something by Philip Bouwsma or Arthur
    Baker, but so far I haven&#39;t found a good match, but I am still reviewing their
    works.

  body: Victor de Castro&#39;s <a href="http://www.unifonts.com/m_pages/manutiusbold.htm"
    target="_blank">Manutius Bold</a> is also similar, but not identical. He also
    has a very calligraphic style, in addition to those others I mentioned. <BR> <BR>Some
    of Bouwsma&#39;s fonts, such as <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?8UB" target="_blank">Juliana</a>,
    <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?5J5" target="_blank">Thalia Italic</a>
    and <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?5GN" target="_blank">Mantegna Italic</a>
    also are rather similar, if a bit more obviously pen-drawn. <BR> <BR>Are you looking
    for the exact match or something with a similar look?

  body: Richard Yeend&#39;s <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=350080"
    target="_blank">&#39;Maidenhead</a>&#39; also has an Italic form that they don&#39;t
    show fully  on the Fonts.com site. It has a very similar R to the sample posted
    by &#39;myuser&#39;. <BR> <BR>If you are wondering why my inputs are fragmented,
    it&#39;s because I am working my way through the Calligraphic fonts in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script04Pg8.html"
    target="_blank">Part 4 of the Script Font ID Guide</a>, and posting when I see
    something I think is at least similar. You might want to look through these pages
    too and see if you can find whatever it is you like about this ROSES sample. You&#39;ll
    need to find your own links to the vendors, though.

  body: See <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=415045" target="_blank">ITC
    Chivalry</a>. At any rate, that seems the closest so far, but the sample they
    show isn&#39;t clear enough to be sure. MyFonts.com doesn&#39;t have it available.
    <BR> <BR>oops. The <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?916" target="_blank">Identifont
    showing</a> makes it clear, that it is not the same. It&#39;s too light, and pen-like,
    but nice just the same.

  body: Ah well, exact is tougher. I think I have run out of ideas. Someone else can
    have a crack at it for now. <BR> <BR>I will have to fall back on the &#39;it could
    be a custom font&#39; line, until I find something closer. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Sorry.
