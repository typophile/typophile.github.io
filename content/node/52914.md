  and well-written proggy, saved me on more than on occasion, highly recommended,
  etc.\r\n\r\nTheir [[http://www.7-zip.org/7ziplogo.png|existing logo]] is bold and
  distinctive, but they don't appear to be paying much attention to the branding and
  pretty much \"crowd-source\" it. They have accumulated quite a bit of logos in [[http://www.7-zip.org/logos.html|their
  gallery]], though not many are actually notable.\r\n\r\nNow .. there is a <strong>7</strong>
  and there is a <strong>Z</strong> in the name. If that's not a match made in a logotype
  heaven, I don't know what it :) \r\n\r\nHere's one of the ideas. It looked very
  nice and balanced on the paper, but now that it's vectorized, it seems to be missing
  something and I just can't put a finger on it.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts, comments ? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/7zip-small_3917.png]"

    work on color backgrounds, since the 7 is an open shape?\r\nIf the Z was offset
    like a drop shadow, perhaps that would reinforce the top horizontal bar of the
    Z making it read more easily, and that also might close up the bottom of the 7...?"

    it's an application icon, you may want to look at conveying the compressing aspect
    of the application similar to Stuffit's logo."

    with translucent characters that appear different where they overlap. The Trivia
    logo did this with individual character strokes but it demonstrates the overlap
    effect. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/truvia_4033.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    quick test below obviously needs a lot of work, but it shows the general idea
    of how this might make the partially-hidden Z clearer.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/7Z_6111.jpg]"

  body: ">> It's not working yet\r\n> Care to elaborate, James?\r\n\r\nI like the
    general direction you're going, but in your first layout I don't care for the
    outline letter (for a number of reasons including that it probably won't reproduce
    well when small) and the Z is too hidden.\r\n\r\nIn your 2nd set of sketches,
    the solid 7 is an improvement, but in the left one the 7 looks stubby and the
    Z is still too hidden, and in the right-side one I don't see a Z at all. \r\n\r\nBut
    I think your concept has possibilities. Perhaps the translucent idea I mentioned
    is worth a try; you also might try offsetting the letters slightly so the top
    of the 7 doesn't totally hide the top of the Z.\r\n"

    I would probably add another serif (?) at the top left corner to make Z even more
    obvious."

    of sitting up there (as it looked odd in your original sitting down on the right).\r\n\r\nBut
    try it. Try slightly different shapes on the serif as well to see if it needs
    to read more as a serif in that case."

    Now that I saw the combination it is indeed obvious :)\r\n\r\nWe tossed several
    ideas <a href=http://dribbble.com/shots/108978-Rebound-me>over at Dribbble</a>,
    and another Michael iterated his way to <a href=http://dribbble.com/shots/114489-7-ZIP-Rebrand>something
    similar to yours</a>. I then emailed the 7zip person saying \"Here are some logo
    ideas\" and never heard anything back, which was not exactly encouraging, and
    so I shelved the whole thing.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Haha lovely how that works out.  I think you should choose a path and polish
    it up, even if the people over at 7-Zip are preoccupied with other things.  It'd
    be nice to have on your portfolio, and if they get around to looking it over,  great!
