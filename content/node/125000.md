  downtown high rise building, in um, Pittsburgh.  :-) I like the proportion of these
  letters, and the the slight serifs.  Any ideas for a good font that I could use
  to match?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pittsburgher_5635.jpg]"

    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/clearface-gothic/ designed by Morris Fuller
    Benton for American Type Founders and released between the years 1907 and 1910.
    Note the flare serifs which, to my eye at least, seem to also exist in the photo
    of the sign.\r\nDon"
