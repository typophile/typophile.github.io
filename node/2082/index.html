I'm hoping John Hudson will chime in. <BR> <BR>And the main reason I'm curious is that I've been working on a similar font since '98, but mine uses grayscaling, so it requires special treatmen/usage.

Until then, as reported, they work great in Flash and Photoshop. <BR> <BR>The trouble is, there is no cross-platform bitmap font standard except TrueType and OpenType pixel fonts. Even MacOS which gave us brilliant post-PARC typography (<a href="http://www.kare.com/MakePortfolioPage.cgi?page=4" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.kare.com/MakePortfolioPage.cgi?page=4">http://www.kare.com/MakePortfolioPage.cgi?page=4</a></a>) has now abandoned its bitmap font heritage. shame. Upside is, if they support pixel sizes, they have to support pixel fonts. Details to be posted to this board. As far as bitmap&lt;-&gt;outline correlation, it may have to be handled by the designer, not insensitive operating systems and apps. <BR> <BR>TiD wants to publish MR. PIXEL. Qu'en pensezvous M.
