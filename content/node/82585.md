  for a long while, but I think it needed some refreshing. The bottom 'a' is the original.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a-pict_4449.png]"

    revise the e."

    like too much other stuff published recently, and its counter size is not in balance
    with that of the e.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, looks great so far!"

  body: Tim Ahrens! I've used your Linotype Aroma as a reference quite a lot. Funny
    what a website like typophile.com can do. I guess I can't disagree with you on
    the /a/. I probably wanted to change the original /a/ because I've seen it too
    much. I've got bored of it. Thank you!

  body: "The e: not actually *wrong*. I just had the feeling that its upper half lacks
    the last tuning of stroke contrast balance \u2026 perhaps it\u2019s just me.\r\n\r\nAnd
    look at the spacing a_t_e.\r\n\r\nVery handsome overall appearance, by the way."

  body: "I'm not averse to any of them. Then I guess it's your choice! I think #3
    is a little too sloping and #1's counter is perhaps verging on small side, so
    maybe 'average' #2 is best.\r\n\r\nSomething I haven't noticed before: the /w/
    looks taller on the left than on the right.\r\n\r\nNice."

    w. Improved Capitals that match the 'new' Capitals in Sensato E will be uploaded
    soon in the critique section ;-)\r\n\r\nI'm sticking with #3. As you said, none
    of them are 'wrong' and #3 is more original than the others."
