body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI am a Graphic Design student at the National Institute of Design
  (NID) in Ahmedabad, currently in the second year. I have been working on a geometric
  sans serif typeface since the last few months. This is my first ever attempt to
  typeface design and so far I only have capital letters. I shall be adding lowercase
  later when I'm happy with the capitals. I received some feedback from my seniors
  at school but now I need expert advice from professional designers so that I can
  take this forward. \r\n\r\nI'm attaching a PDF of the basic characters and some
  sample text. I would really appreciate if you can give me constructive feedback
  on each letter. \r\n\r\nThank you! \r\nManushi Parikh\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JyamitiSans_5853.png]"

    happy.\r\nS: Narrow.\r\nU: Light.\r\nV: Wide.\r\nX: Heavy.\r\nZ: Narrow.\r\n\r\nBut
    most of all: lc comes first! It's 95% of text.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    about the lowercase, I have started working on some characters already but will
    post them when I feel they are ready for a good critique."

  body: I agree with Hrant's comments. :) You could try making a tail for the 'Q'
    that starts at the bottom and drops below. The 'S' is also leaning to the right.By
    the way, I'm not extremely experienced, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

    for quite sometime. I was actually busy with work regarding my semester jury at
    school.\r\n\r\nI have been working on the feedback since the last couple of weeks
    and have also added lowercase letters. I would really appreciate if you can give
    me more feedback.\r\n\r\nI am attaching a pdf with some sample text, changes made
    and the lowercase included."
