  body: "Hey, thanks for sharing.  A must-read for any Angeleno typophile.  :-)\r\n\r\nThe
    font on my own car's screen is a \"Square Grotesque\" which I'm not in love with
    (for one thing the \"6\" looks like an injured \"8\") but it <em>does</em> suit
    the car!\r\nhttp://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/ford-flex45015.jpg\r\n\r\nBTW
    did you notice they used \"Boume\"/\"Bourne\" as a test word? Funny! I actually
    almost made a special \"m\" (and \"a\") for setting the title of my readability
    article way back in Typo magazine #13.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    less affected by the type difference.  I wonder if this is some kind of hunter-gatherer
    thing that would make visual acuity of shapes more important for hunters (and
    hunted)?  Those who survived best were those that could best distinguish friend
    from foe or food from foe. '

    reminds them of sex (and, honestly: what the hell doesn't?), while women could
    generally care less, unless something reminds them of shoes. Even in a video game:
    duh."
