  body: "You can create a suitcase with four styles (plain/italic/bold/bolditalic)
    in FontLab using File >  Generate Suitcase.... \r\n\r\nIf you want to combine
    more fonts than that in one suitcase, you need a Mac running OS 9 or earlier.
    You can simply drag one suitcase file onto another in the Finder to combine them,
    more or less as if they were folders. There may be utilities that can do this
    in OS X, but I can't think of any off the top of my head.\r\n\r\nRegardless of
    whether you combine fonts in a suitcase, you can associate a large number of fonts
    as a family by using the Family Name and PS Font Name fields in the first screen
    of the Font Info dialog in FontLab. Note: This is assuming a PostScript font for
    use on Macs."
