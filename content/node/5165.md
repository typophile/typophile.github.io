    big corporations are more interested in respecting the user&#39;s privacy more
    than protecting our work. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: The only logical model moving forward would be some sort of iTunes for fonts
    whereby licensing would be enforcible by the application. <BR> <BR>Currently,
    only Extensis Suitcase Server for X does a similar function. <BR> <BR>The problem
    for indepentent font makers is just we don&#39;t have the resources to sell an
    instantly downloadable font that can be serialized at the time of purchase and
    instantly dowloaded - Let alone serialized. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D
