  body: "> obsolete wisdom\u2014 like storing X-acto knives\u2026\r\n\r\nHey, I still
    use an X-acto. Not for cutting rubylith or type galleys anymore, but for trimming
    out mockups and that sort of thing. \r\n\r\nBut I agree that you've got to be
    careful; those suckers are sharp! In college a friend of mine would carry one
    around in his shirt pocket (point up with no cap on it), which always seemed dangerous
    to me."

  body: I had a bad habit of sometimes placing my X-acto behind my ear, as I would
    with a pencil. (Kids, do not try this at home.)
