  body: If the question is why did Microsoft include Thai in this font? The answer
    is pretty simple - because Tahoma is Windows &#39;User Interface&#39; font and
    had to support all the languages Windows XP was localized into except Chinese,
    Japanese and Korean which use their own UI fonts. <BR> <BR>Si

  body: Not sure if it is related or not, but Microsoft also gave Thailand a sweet
    deal to ward of their switch to linux. The Thai government was about to switch
    entirely to Linux and MS came in and undercut Linux &#40;which is pretty hard
    to do ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>Not sure what Thailand eventually settled on, but perhaps
    this was part of the bribe.

    <BR> <BR>Thai support has been in Tahoma for several years. Its inclusion certainly
    pre-dates Windows Starter Edition by at least three or four years.  <BR> <BR>Cheers,
