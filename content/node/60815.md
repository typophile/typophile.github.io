    I wonder if this actually is Lorraine, or that one is based on the other.'

  body: I would bet my hat that these letters are modifications made for this design.
    If you look close they seems a bit quirky in comparison with the original ones...
    well, except the "k" which is quite an improvment! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Suhrkamp_3801.gif]

  body: "In the Phil's Photo book \"Homage to the Alphabet\" from 1985, there is a
    script called Brandywine which seems to match every character. It has alternate
    glyphs for G, J, O, S, r, s and z.\r\n\r\nIn one of the Expresiv font collections
    (Photolettering) from 1994 was a font called GonzalesJeanette which is a version
    of Brandy without both alternates of these characters. I will make a sample to
    post soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
