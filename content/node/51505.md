body: I am looking for a typeface similar to the one created by Peter Max and used
  in his [[http://www.petermax.com/|logo]].  If possible, something free or inexpensive,
  as this project is being done as a favor.  Thanking you in advance for any and all
  suggestions!

  body: "It is not uncommon for full typefaces to be derived from custom lettering
    in logos. I have no idea whether such has been done in this case, or whether or
    not it would be publicly available had such a font been made. Sometimes they are
    freely given by the designer, sometimes they are held by the trademark owner under
    exclusive license, or anything in between.\r\n\r\nBest of luck in your search
    for something appropriately similar for your project."

  body: "I realize that Max used hand lettering in creating his own logo.  However,
    from my understanding he also created a typeface called \"Riverside Drive\" (I
    haven't had any luck finding an example of this, I was curious to see whether
    or not it is the same as the one he used in his logo...) and was also pretty fond
    of Cooper Black. \r\n\r\nI not looking for a exact digital replica of his logo
    typeface, just something with a similar feel.  Due to time (and skill) constraints,
    I don't think that I'm up to creating my own!"

    had a similar feel.

  body: Aristik is definitely the style I am looking for!  Now I just need to determine
    whether or not my favor is worth the investment...  Thank you for the suggestion!
