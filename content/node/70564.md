  issue of neglected Cyrillic alphabet.\r\n\r\nIt's a kind of orphan  at the moment.
  It was developed during the Medieval time in the Bulgarian kingdom. Following very
  close graphical characteristic of Greek alphabet, together with Latin, the new alphabet
  become third one from the same family. After Bulgaria was conquered from the Ottoman
  empire the development of this alphabet stopped. It was like that until 18th century,
  when Peter The Great of Russia decided to make some reforms in it. Some letters
  were disregarded, others emerged, third received graphical changes.Initially good,
  this Reform somehow made the gap between similar Greek and Latin grow bigger. \r\n\r\nRight
  now, if you look at the font, containing all of the above mentioned alphabets, you
  can see very strange and obscure things.\r\nLetters like \"K\", \"k\" which even
  sound alike in all alphabets have in fact different faces. Letters \"\u0416\", \"\u0436\"
  suffers from the same \"identity crises\". \"g\", \"n\", \"u\" and other regular
  letters, which, in fact can be similar in latin and cyrillic are intently crated
  with different face, bringing an inconstancy in the general font characteristic.
  \r\n\r\nMy colleagues from Russia are involved in this process, and without any
  intention to offend them, I want to say that such treatment of the fonts is not
  making any good for them. On other hand, designers from non cyrillic countries,
  creating cyrillic fonts are trapped in the same \"mistake\". My opinion is that
  the bigger similarity the easier, cleaner and stylish the font will be to read and
  look, especially when bilingual text are used in the document\r\n \r\nPlease, any
  thoughts?\r\n"
