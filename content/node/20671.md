  are so many out there, but its hard to come across a group of people as friendly
  and helpful as typophile members.  So im curious about where you all might turn
  if you have a prepress topic to discuss?\r\n\r\nCheers. JonnySchneider"

  body: Adobe has a print design forum which has some good stuff, and http://www.desktoppublishingforum.com
    has a section that deals with printing. But the best I have used (don't go there
    any more) was comp.prepress on Usenet.

    and there are some really knowledgable people there, of which Don is one.\r\n\r\nI
    really don't frequent pure prepress forums but I have run into some really sharp
    prepress folks here and there.\r\n\r\nThere's a couple of sharpies on the Layers
    magazine forum, learned a lot there.\r\n\r\nbest of luck!\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: "The best graphic design forum or prepress forums that I have used and frequented
    is at Software-Robotics.Com, they make prepress Xtensions and Plug-Ins and have
    a really industrial strength support forum.  Their products are all heavily supported,
    that's how I found the prepress forum there, I use their automatic PDF workflow
    called PDF-X-Robot.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a customer, even the software
    support folks help non-customers there for unrelated prepress issues.  There's
    about 1200 users on that prepress forum from around the world, designers, publishers,
    prepress and printers.  I've learned allot on there and find it more direct and
    less cluttered than most communities & prepress forums mentioned above.  \r\n\r\n<a
