  I get font families that have just one fontfile to click on and install the complete
  family. Sometimes all the font weights are separate files that you'd need to click
  them all in order to install.\r\nFor some reason the FFIL files are linked together
  and I don't understand how this works. If I knew how this phenomenia is called,
  I could Google for it.\r\n\r\nHow do I make a font family that has one fontfile

  body: "Ralf, I think that works well if you have the naming right and create the
    4 'classical' weigths. But it's not just limited to small families. I bought Helvetica
    Neue which has 52 files in it, and this has just one FFIL suitcase.\r\n\r\nUnder
    OS9, if I remember correctly, you could just drag-and-drop other suitcases into
    one and creacte a family suitcase. \r\n\r\n\xAE"

  body: "A Mac font suitcase (labeled FFIL in OS X) can have a large number of either
    TrueType or NFNT resources in it. An NFNT is a Mac bitmap font originally known
    as \"screen fonts.\" With PostScript Type 1 fonts, you need for each font both
    an NFNT (which also contains the kerning and other info) and a separate PostScript
    outline font file (originally called \"printer fonts\").\r\n\r\n(Note: The font
    suitcase is actually a special kind of file called a <em>resource file</em>. These
    are structured differently than ordinary computer files, and in fact cannot be
    read on other operating systems such as Windows and UNIX.)\r\n\r\nSo, it is possible
    to put a large font family into a single font suitcase. However, this only works
    with Mac TrueType fonts. With PostScript Type 1 fonts, you could do the same thing
    with the \"screen fonts,\" but you would still need a separate file for the outline
    portion of the font. If your Helvetica Neue font were PostScript Type 1, it would
    need at minimum 53 files--one for the font suitcase plus 52 outline font files.\r\n\r\nYou're
    right that OS 9 and earlier allowed you to move fonts in and out of font suitcases
    easily in the Finder, the same way you can move files in and out of folders. For
    some reason, this facility was not carried forward to OS X. I think some of the
    font management utilities have this ability, though."

  body: By the way, my understanding of the .ttc format is that it only works with
    TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts and only works on Windows (so far).

  body: "Mark, that sounds very good. I'll give it a spin later on.\r\n\r\nIt's shitty
    though that they didn't carry that forward to OS X. Normally I install the fonts
    by just clicking on the FFIL file. This either opens all the font files or just
    the one I clicked on. I believe the Helvetica Neue opens all the fonts at once
    to install. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\xAE"
