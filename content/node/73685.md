  more of, but for now, I am looking for some elegant yet legible script typefaces
  (and a body copy typeface, too, if you can find a good match of both) for some wedding
  invitations I am designing.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any help."

  body: "I've spent some time researching wedding fonts for my job, and the sudtipos
    fonts mentioned above are definitely some of the best for wedding invitations.
    Burgues, Adios, and Miss LeGatees can be seen on Bella Figura's letterpress site
    for inspiration [[http://www.bellafigura.com/]] (although the fonts are given
    different names by Bella Figura)\r\n\r\nOther good script fonts for wedding invites
    besides the good but overused Bickham Script:\r\nNovia (Font Bureau)\r\nSloop
    (Font Bureau)\r\nTangier (Font Bureau)\r\nGravura (myfonts, fontshop)\r\nCitadel
    Script (fontshop)\r\nMemoir (veer)\r\nMontague Script (veer)\r\nP22 Zaner\r\nP22
    Allyson\r\nPlumero Script (veer, fontshop)\r\nFeel Script (veer)\r\nOlicana Smooth
    (veer, fontshop)\r\nAnnabelle (veer)\r\nDear Sarah (veer)\r\nNelly Script (myfonts)\r\n\r\nFor
    complimentary type (usually set in all caps or small caps), engravers gothic and
    sackers gothic light go well with most scripts. Also, letterspaced geometric fonts
    in a lighter weight look good- fonts like Futura, Verlag, Mr. Eaves Modern, or
    Neutraface No. 2. I've seen some cool minimalist invites using H and FJ's Archer.
    For serif type, Mrs. Eaves definitely evokes wedding but is not the most original
    choice. Adobe Garamond capitals look good but are more formal. The trajan alternative
    called Classic Roman also works well in a wedding invite context.\r\n\r\nElum
    also has some cool invites [[http://www.elumdesigns.com/letterpress/affordable-letterpress-wedding-invitations/15-15/]]\r\n"
