body: "I'm looking for a perfectly square, monospace typeface that includes upper
  and lower case letters. With uppercase only there are many options, but I can't
  seem to find anything perfectly square that includes lowercase. Pixel fonts are
  eligible, but ideally it would have a rounded corner here and there, like something
  Crouwel would do (he might have already and I just missed it \u2014\_please fill
  me in)."
