  body: Discussion of the differences between the campaigns has been exhausted for
    sure. Maybe something about how design has changed over the years. Are the campaign
    buttons of today different or the same as those from the 20th century?

    user icons and facebook group joins than all the obama anything in the real world.
    Maybe that's just cause I spend too much time on the machine, but it seems like
    campaigning is lending itself more and more towards the internet, which is dominated
    by design rather than physicality. In the real world having a sign versus having
    no sign seems to make the difference. On the web the competition for space isn't
    as wide a gap, so looking better seems to be more important.\r\n\r\nI also see
    calendars (albeit set in futura bold condensed) [[http://www.iclips.net/deadheadsforobama.php|signage]],
    etc. etc. which is campaign design taken into the hands of supporters, which bugs
    me greatly.\r\n\r\nsorry. as for the actual fonts I don't think there's a whole
    lot that hasn't been covered."

    for it to be dumb luck. He has been packaged in a way that no other presidential
    candidate ever has been. The designer in me loves this, but the pessimist in me
    keeps thinking it is just a little too perfect. But that's when the designer in
    me pipes up again and asks why is that bad?

    of a comet about to strike the Earth to choosing a campaign logo, would form a
    committee of career political staffers to hash out ideas with what little understanding
    they have of the subject, perhaps drawing some guidance from public opinion polls.
    Obama has often demonstrated that he would see that the best solutions can only
    come from, in the former case, an actual astrophysicist, or in the latter case,
    an actual graphic designer, and go talk to the best one he can find.'
