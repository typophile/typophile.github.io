body: "I'm very new to typophile. Just picked fontlab up in the past 2 weeks. While
  I have a many fonts designed in Illustrator it's not until I actually started transfering
  them into fontlab that I found out my mistakes... Which is great. Love to learn.\r\n\r\nHowever
  I get all through placing my caps, numbers, and some punctuation in fontlab when
  I'm looking at some accented glyph windows and think to myself I never took accents
  above the ascender into account... Doh! And I can't find my answer anywhere.\r\n\r\nWhen
  setting up the UPM of the font do accents get calculated in the size of the ascender?
  I noticed most accents use the ascender line as the base line for them to start
  which really nulls the getting calculated in the ascender part. Of course I used
  the fontlab forum sticky \"using illustrator to make fonts\" post to determine my
  UPM=1000, Ascender=742, Cap Height=714, Descender=-258. I wanted my Ascender to
  barely break cap height.\r\n\r\nHow do accents or any symbol above the ascender
  get calculated in the font UPM or does it? Am I going to have change Ascender UPM
  or will Line height compensate for it?"

  body: "The accents don't have to figure in the calculation of the ascender, but
    they DO have to be used in calculating the bounding box (FontBBox), or else clipping
    could occur in some instances.\r\n\r\nThe way I do it (which may not be the best
    way or even the correct way, but it seems to work) is, AFTER you've placed your
    accents, to go to the \"Additional Font Metrics\" page of the font info dialog,
    choose \"Set Custom Values\" and hit \"Recalculate.\" This process will set the
    correct numbers for the bounding box. Then go back one page, enter the Ascender
    and Descender values (making sure, as in your example, that their positive values
    equal 1,000), check the \"Copy values to TrueType metrics\" box, and hit \"Apply.\"\r\n\r\nThis
    latter step helps avoid FontLab's erroneous error message of \"[WARNING] <FLSFNT0F03>
    The feature file OS/2 overrides TypoAscender and TypoDescender do not sum to the
    font bbox size!\" when testing or generating an OpenType font. If you follow the
    procedure outlined, you won't get that message.\r\n"

  body: "Typically, in a Latin font, the Ascender value should equal the height of
    the lowercase d and the Descender should equal the depth of the lowercase p. So
    accent marks or anything else extending above these heights may fall outside the
    body height (UPM height).\r\n\r\nIf you are making OpenType or TTF fonts, you
    also need to set the OS/2 WinMetrics and hhea Metrics, and these should be generous
    enough to avoid clipping the accent marks or other elements that extend beyond
    the body height.\r\n\r\nSee this Typowiki article for more details:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/13081?\r\n\r\nBe
    sure to read the whole article, because it involves some revisions to recommended
    practices.\r\n\r\n "
