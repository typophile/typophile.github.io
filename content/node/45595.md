  body: "The sign looks hand-painted, based on the variations of identical letters.
    The very large counters on the P and R will be the hardest aspects to match. The
    closest thing I can think of offhand is [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=8&subpage=viewfonts|House
    Bullet]], and a number of letters would need to be modified, especially C, M and
    N. You could backslant it to make the vertical letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks for the help. I've been working with a font called "Agency" that has
    a similar look, only more square. I still feel like I've seen this font somewhere
    before...
