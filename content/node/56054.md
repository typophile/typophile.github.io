body: "I have a few questions regarding MM builds to create a range of typeface weights
  for the future\u2026\r\n\r\n1. Is there any available multiple master Fontlab sample
  files anywhere? I learn better by seeing and doing and I'd like to look at the inner
  workings of one if possible.\r\n\r\n2. Are the interpolation results similar in
  their imperfection as using a bold effect feature? I assume their would be considering
  any type of automated process is by nature, imperfect. (I've already downloaded
  RMX 1.53 in anticipation assuming it will only help the process of manipulation
  and accuracy further)\r\n\r\n3. What is a good weight combination to start with,
  I vaguely remember reading posts that mention a certain combination\u2026 i.e. start
  with light and bold but nothing too extreme in range?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\nPS:
  I just opened an existing font I have, I've defined a 'Weight' axis, I see the Axis
  palette, I've selected between the masters but do not see 'different masters appearing
  as outlines of different colors', nor does anything seem to happen when I select
  either 'master' and adjust the weight slider? Am I missing something here, what
  do I have to do to get things to happen here? lol"

  body: 'Yea, the best place to start is the fontlab guide. It sounds like you''re
    just creating a new axis from just one master, which would make both layers of
    the font identical. I''d suggest finding the section in the guide that covers
    multiple masters and the blend tool. '

    my own version of it\u2026 or replace it with a bizarre Morrison quote?\r\n\r\nI
    read the manual and followed it, I just learn better by seeing it, manual's always
    lose me at some point\u2026 I pretty much learned Fontlab Studio through a combination

    again, maybe grab the other weight of said font and import it so the two 'layers'
    are different\u2026 when I think layers I visualize Illustrator layers, I'll figure
    it all out, I'm so close!!!"

  body: "Okay I chose two existing weights I had from a previously designed font 'Light'
    and 'Bold'  then I chose 'Blend Fonts' and created my MM file and in seconds created
    a 'Thin' version and generated the instance of it\u2026\r\n\r\nSo I guess using
    MM's is just a hyper efficient way of dealing with weights and widths\u2026 although
    like anything automated it still requires manual clean up and tweaks.\r\n\r\nSo
    when designing in anticipation of using MM's you need either 'extreme' of your
    font pre-designed and completed, as in a light and a bold version, or a thin and
    a black version or a condensed and extended version to start with, is this correct?\r\n\r\nAnd
    since the 'Blend Fonts' command works so well, what is the benefit of 'manually'
    creating a MM font? (At this point I don't even know how to do an MM build manually,
    I reached a dead end with that until trying the Blend command but I'm curious
    as to why one process is better than the other)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: "Why manually create an MM fonts instead of using the \"Blend Fonts\" command?
    Working in MM space ensures that your master fonts remain compatible. The number
    of ways things can get messed up is much more limited.\r\n\r\nNo, interpolations
    are not particularly similar to using the bold effect command. They have different
    pluses and minuses, essentially. Generally better, but there are things to watch
    out for. Read Adobe tech note 5015 on MMs:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/font/pdfs/5091.Design_MM_Fonts.pdf\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    but it wasn't so bad for this particular font.\r\n\r\nAm I right then, that basically
    for MM compatibility say\u2026 a capital 'T' that has 8 node pts. in the 'light'
    weight has to match the capital 'T' with exactly 8 node pts. in the bold? Is it
    as simple as that?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"
