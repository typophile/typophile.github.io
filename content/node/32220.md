  body: univers? imho akzidenz grotesk, all the posters (opera-poster by brockmann
    with the big m for example) and so on.. speaks way more swissness (for me). really,
    in my everyday life, i see like 90% helvetica (mixed with arial), 5% akzidenz,
    5% univers here in switzerland - only the grotesques counted.

    fonts from Swiss books, \r\nThe interesting thing is that when you look closely
    at Swiss Typography/objective Typography/International Style you can actually
    distinguish between the graphic design coming out of Basel and Zurich. The differences
    seem to have origins in the surprisingly angry 1946 slagging match between Max
    Bill and Jan Tschichold in the pages of the Schweizer Graphische Mitteilungen,
    (more in the University of Reading Typography Papers 4, 2000) or a general long-term
    rivalry between the two cities. Using Univers in a book would be more associated
    with Basel - Emil Ruder used it a lot (and I believe he and Adrian Frutiger were
    good friends). For reproductions of Ruder\u2019s book (and children\u2019s book)
    designs in Univers (and one in Baskerville) check out the excellent article \u201CEmil
    Ruder, Typography from the inside\u201D by Helmut Schmidt in Baseline 36, 2002.
    In Zurich Max Bill and the people editing Neue Grafik magazine (Lohse, M\xFCller-Brockmann,
    Neuburg, Vivarelli) seem to have been concerned with making graphic design that
    was actually modern (concrete) art for whome Univers was a bit too stylish and
    flashy and seem to only use AkzGrot and Helvetica in their attempt at \u2018zero
    degrees\u2019 typography that was pure communication with no style (which of course
    quickly became a style). This is mostly true for book design of the style and
    the period you are referring to but strangely enough my copy of \u201CGraphic
    Design Manual\u201D by Armin Hofmann is Univers 55 on the front cover and spine
    but the rest is Akzidenz which I\u2019ve never really understood at all.\r\n\r\nUn
    grand \u201Ctout d\u2019bon\u201D helv\xE9tique,\r\nSimon H. \r\n\r\nP.S. There\u2019s
    a heavyweight study on this subject by Zurich-based academic Christoph Bignens
    called \u201CSwiss Style 1914-1964\u201D, but I\u2019m not sure if it has come
    out in English yet. \r\n"

  body: "My family used to be good friends to the Ruders, and I litteraly grew up
    surrounded by Swiss style graphics and typography (I don\u2019t think, however,
    that Emil Ruder\u2014an excellent musician, by the way\u2014was that close to
    Adrian Frutiger\_\u2026). I\u2019ve never thought about it, but I think what Simon
    wrote is perfectly true: There are considerable differences between a Basle version
    and a Z\xFCrich version of Swiss style. It undoubtedly has something to do with
    the respective protagonists\u2014Ruder, Tschichold and Basel Gewerbeschule vs.
    Bill and Z\xFCrich Kunstgewerbeschule. Add to that a traditional rivalry between
    the two cities and the different styles of the respective publishers. Ironically,
    a lot of what is called \"Swiss style\" today (especially in American publications),
    Ruder and other Basel teachers would never have approved of. One easily forgets
    that many Swiss\u2014or Basel\u2014designers of the time had a rather different
    idea of \"Swiss style\", including many not-so-sober styles like the ones of Leupin
    or GGK agency.\r\n\r\nTout d\u2019 bon to all the Swiss typophiles\r\nFlorian\r\n "

  body: "Simon,\r\nI studied design and typography with Basle graduates. Ken Hiebert
    was my typography teacher and a Basle grad. He was a student of Ruder and Hofmann.
    We used Univers exclusively in those classes in the 60s. Two years later, I met
    Peter Megert while working at the Westinghouse design Center. He is from Bern
    and apprenticed with M\xFCller-Brockmann. He ALWAYS used Helvetica. It was clear
    to him that the Basle people were from a different planet. He would qualify anything
    about a Basle designer with, \"But he is from Basle.\" said in such a way as if
    to excuse his failing do to an affliction :-) It would be like saying, \"That
    man just walked into a wall, but then again he is blind.\" Peter is still a friend
    and was always a big joker so you have to understand his dry sense of humor. He
    made many jokes about his Swiss homeland, complaining how boring it was to see
    nothing but cheese and watches all day--he then would smile and say, \"But the
    chocolate is good.\"\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: The helvetica in the text of \"Graphic

  body: "Florian & Chris,\r\nThank you both for the very interesting info. \r\nI\u2019d
    really like to know if Florian remembers the Ruders being interested in Japanese
    art/eastern philosophy at all, as it seems to be a link between the two schools/currents.
    Emil Ruder wrote an article called \u201COn drinking tea, typography, historicism,
    symmetry and asymmetry\u201D for the Typographische Monatsbl\xE4tter in 1952 (v.2
    p.83) which links the relationship between printed and unprinted areas on a page
    to ideas of \u2018empty\u2019 and \u2018full\u2019 from Taoism. JM-B was a student
    of zen for many years and married a Japanese artist (Shizuko Yoshikawa) who studied
    at Ulm \u2013 which must have something to do with him going down to one point
    size and one weight for the \u201Cmusica viva\u201D posters in the late 50s and
    the famous \u201CAkari\u201D poster which is basically a big coloured \u2018enso\u2019.
    \r\nRe: GKK, Good point, concrete art wasn\u2019t just from Zurich as Basle has
    it\u2019s own \u2018graphic designer and concrete artist\u2019 in GKK\u2019s Karl
    Gerstner (who did the Swissair corporate identity as well as loads of geometric
    abstract art). \r\n\r\nThierry,\r\nHa, Ha, very sorry. I somehow don\u2019t think
    you are the only person on this website who spends too much money on typography
    books, though. \r\nBest wishes.\r\nSimon H.\r\n"

  body: "Simon, I don\u2019t know any particulars, but it is very well possible that
    Ruder had some interest in Eastern graphics and/or philosophy (I was born after
    Ruder died, so I cannot speak from memory). However, this is a penchant\u2014should
    I say a hobby\u2014that many of the designers of the time shared. The view of
    Japanese and Chinese graphics being the ideal of printing and visual culture was
    extremely widespread. Not all designers had the insight and zeal of Tschichold,
    who did really some research on the topics. Others\u2019 knowledge never got beyond
    Eugen Herrigel\u2019s Zen-books.\r\n\r\nWhat strikes me is another thing: When
    I browse to new publications on \"Swiss design\", I sometimes find that one aspect
    is undervalued: the fact that almost all of the leading figures of Swiss design
    were teachers and saw themselves formost as teachers. This \u203Atradition\u2039
    extends to living designers such as Hochuli and Bosshardt. It is also interesting
    to see that some of the designers of international fame were happy to live for
    thirty or forty years in one and the same Swiss city, almost without travelling
    further than their holiday home in the Swiss Alps once a year! If you compare
    that to hectic schedule of todays \u203Astars\u2039, you might find another reason
    for the quite and concentrated look of Swiss style of the time. And indeed, I
    sometimes wonder whether today\u2019s extensive travelling and \u203Acongressing\u2039
    is that helpful for design itself.\r\n\r\nNow I really have to do my work\r\nF
