  body: "You could approximate this look with bold condensed weights of Radiant, available
    from many foundries. In fact, I think that's what \"Gwyneth Paltrow\" and \"Summer
    2004\" are set in.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/radiant/rr-bold-condensed-alternate/\r\n\r\n\r\nFont
    Bureau's Roxy is another option:\r\n\r\nhttp://fontbureau.com/fonts/sans/Roxy/charset\r\n\r\nIt
    has the rounded A you'll need."
