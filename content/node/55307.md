body: "I've seen a lot of rubbish out there about font stacks for web use, so I wanted
  to see if we could come up with some better ones. It's a matter up for much debate,
  but I'd like to see what we can come up with.\r\n\r\nHere is my contribution. Feel
  free to rip it to shreds, and add/delete. Apologies in advance to Linux users.\r\n\r\n
  \"Humanist Sans\":\r\n<code>font-family: \"Gill Sans\", \"Gill Sans MT\", \"Gill
  Sans Std\", GoudySans, \"ITC Goudy Sans Std\", \"Myriad Pro\", \"Myriad Web\", \"Myriad
  Std\", \"Bitstream Vera Sans\", Verdana, sans-serif;</code>\r\n\r\n\"Oldstyle\":\r\n<code>font-family:
  \"Adobe Jenson Pro\", \"Hoefler Text\", \"Centaur\", \"Centaur MT\", \"Garamond
  Premier Pro\", \"Stempel Garamond\", \"Adobe Garamond Pro\", \"Adobe Garamond\",
  \ Garamond, Georgia, serif;</code>\r\n\r\n\"Geometric Sans\": <<- My worst one.
  Needs help.\r\n<code>font-family: \"Futura\", \"Century Gothic, \"Tw Cen MT\", \"Gill
  Sans\", \"Gill Sans MT\", \"Gill Sans Std\", \"URW Gothic L\", sans-serif;</code>"

  body: "@georgebutler The w.3point7designs article is indeed interesting. It actually
    helped me justifying my use of Gill Sans in a recent project. The big issue is
    that some people cannot let go of the fact that many people are going to see different
    designs, regardless of the designers intent. That's just the way of the web.\r\n\r\nThe
    WORST font stack article was the most recent Sitepoint.com article http://www.sitepoint.com/article/eight-definitive-font-stacks/\r\n\r\nI
    felt a lot of bile in my throat as I read that, and it is what has spurred me
    on to create better, more typographically informed font stacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n@litherland\r\nI
    don't recall ever seeing that chart. Very nice!"
