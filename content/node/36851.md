  body: "Hi Jayy:\r\n\r\nOpps sorry... The w is too wide and adnix is right out the
    g- looks too weird and is actually distracting. The straight to curve transitions
    need to be smoothed out a little bit better. The k need to be reworked- made narrower.
    I think maybe the stroke weight is a little too heavy? \r\n\r\n I love the dots
    on the i's- they looks like lemons.\r\n\r\nHoped I helped you.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz"

  body: "The 'g' is changing - I like the top part for now but I will try different
    versions anyway.\r\n\r\nMike - \r\n\r\nDo you mean the top of the curves need
    to be straightened? Looking real close the top part of the curve maybe a bit jagged.
    I am happy with the general curve angle though. What do you think? They are supposed
    to mirror the dots on the 'i's'\r\n\r\nI was actually happy with the 'w' - should
    I compare it to other typefaces to refine the proportion? I would have to reduce
    the angle of the arms to make it narrower as it is supposed to be geometric in
    proportion.\r\n\r\nThe more I look at the 'k' the more I think it could be improved.
    To maintain it's geometric appearance again I would have to reduce the 45 degree
    angle on the arms. What do you make of the descender on the 'k'? I feel it sits
    maybe a little uncomfortably but not due to it's proximity to the following 'i'.\r\n\r\nThank
    you all for your invaluable feedback. Please keep it coming.\r\n\r\nJay\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi again :\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you call it but when certain curves are
    not antialiased or hinted they look really rough. \r\nI think but I'm not sure-
    the k would look better if the angle of the right part of the k was a little more
    'open'. This would also mean that the w have to be more compact as well. This
    is a good thing because it will give the descender on the k more room with the
    i.\r\n\r\nBut there is something else that concerns me... The logo is geometric
    and extended and so is the \"truly natural body care\". I think you should have
    the logo extended and text normal or condensed. The logo should be funky and the
    text a neutral sans. I think it would aid in better presentation of what the product
    does. Right now you might have two things competing with each other.\r\n\r\nWill
    this be for a bottle, box, or the whole entire campaign?\r\n\r\nAll my best,\r\n\r\nMike
    Diaz :-)"

  body: "OK, here are some revisions I have made. This logotype would be for an entire
    campaign to include a bottle, box, print collateral etc.\r\n\r\nI have thinned
    the strokes and made it a little more condensed by reducing the 'k' and 'w'.\r\nThe
    'g' has been updated to simple include a circular descender. \r\n\r\nI am in two
    minds about the use of Tarzana for the 'truly natural bodycare' tagline. I understand
    Mike's comments about competition between the logotype and the tag. I have tried
    setting it in Helvetica and of course, it looks so neutral that it could not be
    obtrusive. For the purpose of this critique I have left it set in Tarzana as I
    feel I would prefer to use something that represented the overall identity and
    message more.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJay\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kiwi

  body: "I think, depending on the proportions of the bottle and box, you might need
    to develop a stacked version. I preferred the g in the first version as a starting
    point, the top storey could be smaller while the lower increases in height; I
    don\u2019t find the w particularly wide but I think you can amend the central
    stroke by rotating it clockwise to close slightly the righthand opening and, more
    importantly, open up the lefthand; the strapline is rather small in proportion
    and seems to have no reason for its position,  currently slightly too low and
    hanging out to the right.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I would ditch the swoosh jumping off from the bottom of the 'k'.  That's
    way too much.\r\n\r\nOverall, the letterforms just don't harmonize very well together.
    \ In a wordmark, either all the letters need to be equal in character or there
    should be one letter that's carrying the quirks, with the others supporting it.
    \ You've got the 'g' and the 'w', and in some sense the 'k' all fighting with
    each other for attention, while the 'i' and 'o' are bit players.  \r\n\r\nLook
    at the whole wordmark small as well. The connection between the top and bottom
    of the 'g' is almost insignificant and may disappear.  The 'g' form has potential,
    but needs some work. Try making the bottom smaller than the top."

  body: "Most curved characters (doesn\u2019t apply to your g as the top right already
    deals with it) are slightly above and below the x-height and baseline of other
    characters to compensate for the visual lack of height, probably easier to understand
    by comparing the characters of an existing typeface, most obvious at the base
    of the o, but I would add some to the top as well. The comment about the letterspace
    and word spaces was mostly directed at the strapline although the word space in
    kiwi glow is a touch wide for the tight kerning, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nTim"
