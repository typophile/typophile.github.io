body: "This is a continuation of a previous thread: http://typophile.com/node/7596.\r\n\r\nWhere
  you will notice the biggest change is in the italics, which are really what are
  most this face. The nice thing about having made the contrast very low in the roman
  is that it gives an even, dark impression that well suited to academic papers which
  require to be set double spaced. \r\n\r\nI had pretty much stopped working on this
  for a few years except for minor tweaks as I used if for my academic papers. I've
  refined the outlines, improved the kerning (maybe going a bit overboard), added
  some IPA characters, accents, logical symbols, etc. Currently I am developing lining
  figures and am trying to prep these fonts for release. (It is a lot of work!) I
  may release the titling caps with just caps and punctuation for free and then sell
  the roman and italic as companion faces. Haven't quite worked that out yet.\r\n\r\nIf
  you print this out I think you will see that the roman reads very well, with a dark,
  even color and good legibility. The roman strikes me as quite neutral, making it
  a typeface well suited to the demands of academic publishing in the humanities;
  the italic adds a pleasant contrast to the roman but needs redesigned figures and
  improved spacing.\r\n\r\nI will post more samples over the next while for italic
  issues and the design of the lining figures. Special thanks goes out to Hrant who
  really helped and encouraged me so much back when I started work on this (and back
  when you were posting 250 times per day). I knew absolutely nothing about font design
  then, and have learned much thanks to your help as well as the help of other typophilers.
  \r\n\r\nI have also made a few other fonts that I will post for discussion, although
  this crit boards seem pretty slow these days."

  body: The Display or Titling version will be available soon, hopefully within the
    next week. I attached a sample to the initial post. I guess I will make it available
    on MyFonts, but I have to decide what I want the EULA to be.

  body: "Has it been more than four years?! Wow. I certainly missed that 5! Grrr...\r\n\r\nI
    wish I could claim some sort of magnanimity for helping out previously, but frankly
    I do it because I enjoy it. On the other hand I'm certainly happy to hear you
    say it's been useful to you. I do hope more people will join in though. Font crits
    are still the most valuable thing about Typophile.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis has a
    very old, confident air about it. Reminds me of Quadraat in that way, although
    this is more... British; it's quaint in a different dimension. I'll have to print
    it to get a good feel for its color and spacing, but it looks promising onscreen.
    As for the italic, it's the sort that appeals to me, but it does seem quite loose.
    Is that intentional?\r\n\r\nMost of all: could you provide a character set?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Wow, this is a truly <em>gorgeous</em> face. Will it be available for purchase?
    I'd buy this for that marvellous G alone. I have to agree that the italic could
    benefit from a little tighter spacing, though. Otherwise, I cannot fault this
    at all. Great work!

  body: Although I find this typeface pretty nice don't you think the stem of the
    t is a bit too large in the roman? See the difference between the t, the f and
    the r. Keep going.

  body: "I don't want to discourage you but I take a second look at your typeface
    and I'm pretty sure there is something that could improve your typeface. The stem
    of some letter are too wide or the rounded letter are too thin. Take a closer
    look at the word like \u201Cnot, brought, very, sides\u201D to name a few. However
    the oblique one, v,w, x fit well with the e, o, s but the t, h, r don't. "

  body: "Sindre, thanks for the compliment :) I'm assuming you mean the titling font.
    I like it quite a lot and rarely use other fonts for titles. \r\n\r\nAndr\xE9,
    thanks for the feedback. Are you referring to the text weight or the display?
    I'll have to ask you to clarify what you mean so that I know how to respond to
    you. If you're saying that the h and n are too wide in relation to the round letters,
    I think you'll find that quite the opposite is true in relation to many contemporary
    faces. If I have a minute, I try to comp a comparison so we can discuss it that
    way.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that my goal for this was to produce a faithful revival,
    rather than an lovely text face. It turns out, however, that it is highly useable.
    I've used it in as bad conditions as 9pt at 600dpi, and it still holds up. It
    is certainly more robust than it is beautiful! (I'm talking strictly about the
    text weight here.)\r\n\r\nAlso bear in mind that I've done <em>very</em> little
    work on the titling lowercase. I'm not even sure I will include it in a final
    release. Any critique for aspect?"

  body: I was referring to the width of the stem of some letters for the text weight.
    Yesterday the print out of the text weight shows the t, r and h to name a few,  with
    a stem wider than the other stem. That thing showed a weird effect on reading
    the text giving not a regular gray. This morning I printed the same page and the
    stem of the latter was better but still too wide. I just wanted to say to you
    this, be sure your stem are the same width on all letters to assure a regular
    gray and an easier readability. It also could be a print out problem, so probably
    what I saw it's not real.

  body: "Andre, this is not good that the stems are not printing consistently for
    you. I wonder why this is? Mathematically, the stems are very simple in this font
    which why I thought I it gives good results at a variety of resolutions. Both
    straight and bowl vertical stems of the lowercase letters are all the same, 80
    units on a 1000unit em. They can be the same because of the angle of the stroke
    on the bowls. The o, being vertical, has heavier sides of 96. I have the basic
    stems defined accurately in the font info, so I am not sure why it would be printing
    inconsistently. It might be that to produce a more even color I would have to
    adjust the contrast of some of the letters. But then I would lose authenticity.
    \r\n\r\nThanks for taking such a close look at it. Any comments on the lowercase
    display? I haven't given that part much thought yet.\r\n\r\nP.S. Sorry for accidentally
    typing your name wrong last post!"
