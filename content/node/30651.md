body: So I've been following this forum for a while and I've noticed little to no
  talk of Corel's DTP programs. Are they not that useful or has Adobe's product simply
  become the new standard? The reason I ask is that I would like to get a decent DTP
  package and Corel is way more affordable, especially with their special pricing
  for non-profits.

    buggy releases for so long that many people just don't care anymore. For several
    versions it was not possible to draw a solid 45 degree line! I'm pretty sure that
    angry users even filed a class action over Corel Draw 5. Anyway, Illustrator and
    Freehand got so busy trying to outdo each other that most people pretty much forgot
    about Corel Draw. \r\n\r\nAs for Ventura, I've never heard of anybody actually
    using it, and never seen it on the list of formats that most printers accept.
    Given how much trouble designers have just getting printers to accept the latest
    Quark and InDesign files you might want to talk to your regular printer and find
    out if they can even use Ventura files.\r\n\r\nIf you're only getting it to save
    money, just bite the bullet and get the Adobe Creative Suite. Between the fonts
    and the software, it's worth every penny."

    keyboard shortcuts) that are different.\r\n\r\nI hate Corel for its lack of support
    of OpenType features. If you want to use any ligatures, etc., you have to insert
    them manually. It's a pain.\r\n\r\nIf you're starting from scratch, don't go with
    Corel, or at least wait until they support OpenType properly... which might be

  body: "I have been using Corel since the version 3 and I can say it had its ups
    and downs. Not mentioning version 6 that was a pain in the ass - especially the
    Czech translation, I had no major problems with Corel. It is true, that until
    the version 10 it was almost impossible to \"snap to objects\". Also version 10
    and 11 used so many system resources, that my CPU ran on 95% almost all the time.
    Right now I am using the version 12 and I am very satisfied. I can do any graphics
    in no time. I've tried probably all other DTP programs (even the Linux ones :)
    just out of curiosity (always looking for something better :), but everytime I
    switched back to Corel. It just suites me better. It's easy, intuitive and doesn't
    force me to do things the way I don't want to.\r\n\r\nI think that it is not a
    graphic program that makes a goot graphics designer. I could show you my old man's
    designs he did in Corel 3 and you could say if you were able to do it in the latest
    releases of the best DTP programs."

  body: "I used to work on Corel Draw for vector graphics and light layouts but since
    I switched to an employee position (with macs which don't run Corel) a year ago
    I have been usind Illustrator. I have started to like Illustrator a bit more than
    Corel but I still think that Illustrator might learn a couple of things from Corel
    such as:\r\n\r\n* Selection of objects can be done in the Illustrator way (being
    touched by the frame) or the Corel way (being inside the frame only) you switch
    by depressing a key only. Sometimes it's a real pain to select objects in Illustrator.\r\n\r\n*
    BCPs are so tiny and hard to select in Illustrator it really desperates me. Corel
    has a better way of selecting and editing BCPs.\r\n\r\n* Corel has graphic handles
    for tracking, word spacing, kerning and leading in the artistic text mode so it's
    very easy to adjust logos, headlines and type tricks.\r\n\r\n* Corel has a very
    practical way of joining and breaking apart paragraphs, sentences, words and glyphs
    so it's ver easy to play with type as well.\r\n\r\n* Corel has a much more practical
    way of handling vector objects than illustrator's pathfinder.\r\n\r\n* Shortcuts
    are better in Corel.\r\n\r\n* Lining, arranging and grouping objects seemed easier
    in Corel to me.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand transparency sucks, paragraph type control
    is hard, no open type support, it crashes a bit more and bitmap effects are bad.
    However being the economical situation in M\xE9xico as it is, Corel remains a
    very popular program and many respectable designers use it.\r\n\r\nCorel Ventura,
    I've never tried it.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "I'm trying to make the switch to Adobe after using Corel Draw and Ventura
    Publisher for the past 17 years. Any Mac-head will tell you that Adobe is far
    superior. Advice: don't listen to them. They've never used Corel so they don't
    know. I'm amazed at how much InDesign lacks when compared to Ventura Publisher.
    Here's just a few examples:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Corel Ventura can vary the widths of
    individual column within a frame. Column widths within a frame must be of identical
    value with InDesign. This is an unbelievable fact to me.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Paragraph
    breaks. Corel allows for 'No Break' paragraphs meaning that entire paragraphs
    can sit side by side within the same text frame. This eliminates the need for
    columns or threaded frames in Ventura (it's still available, just not needed).
    Surprisingly this feature dramatically streamlines your work.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Document
    navigation is far better in Corel Ventura. Ventura embeds chapters into one vp
    file and lists the chapters in it's navigator window.  A simple click takes you
    to that document. InDesign requires a separate document file for each chapter.
    (Ugh - a MAJOR disappointment).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Interface. Corel relies heavily
    on dynamic context menus/pop up windows. This removes a lot of the clutter found
    with the InDesign interface. Additionally, Ventura let's you edit several paragraph
    styles without having to close and re-open another dialog box. \r\n\r\n\u2022
    Ventura is considerably faster with long documents.\r\n\r\nCS3 is far better with
    color, especially spot colors. Ventura has a hard time with spot color bitmap
    files. A huge turn-off for print shops.\r\n\r\nCorel's biggest mistake is the
    fact that it's only on Windows. Since the vast majority of graphic designers are
    Mac based, Corel automatically reduced their fair share of the market thus eliminating
    any consideration as a competitive graphics package. A real shame seeing how much
    has gone into that program.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for something easy (actually
    kinda fun) with lots of features, then Corel is your answer. Well worth the value.
    Adobe has room to grow and I'm sure a lot can be expected of them in the next
    few years.\r\n\r\n"

    Bryce 5, Toon Boom Express and a bunch of Bitstream fonts. It has gotten me over
    a hump while I've been unable to afford my Adobe upgrades, but the damn thing
    explodes if I try to enter anything from the character pallette.\r\n\r\nWhy Corel
    abandoned further revisions on the Mac I don't know. It would seem that the merger
    of Adobe and Macromedia (with the death of Freehand) would be a window of opportunity
    for them. Did they really expect that they would instantly sell more than 3-10%
    the copies for MacOS than they do for Windows, when another company dominated
    that market segment and there are only 3-10% Macs out there anyway?\r\n\r\nAt
    least Corel is still porting Painter. *sigh*"
