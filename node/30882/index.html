<div class=commentbody>That's a very dry pun.
What I am pondering is like a fusion of 1001freefonts and typophile crit forum. Basically, one could see if a font has only a half a character set, or bizarro kerning at the same place they download it.
Typophile crit forum does not have any sort of index where one can flip through fonts, or a digest form of the crits at the top of the page, etc.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Off the top of my head, the rating factors might be, (stylistic) consistency, language support, kerning and tracking, buglessness, freeness, and similar things. Mostly technical, only a little bit of "style", since an image would get that across better.

I thought of "ministryofpunctuation" but that would be better for a grammar site.
Naming is fun, and all, but wouldn't it be worth discussing the mechanics of the thing? How are fonts to be selected for evaluation? Who would be eligible to vote? Would everyone's vote count equally, or would specially qualified experts hold greater sway?</div>

That will at least have to be a selectable skin!
<em>What purpose is this proposed site meant to serve exactly? Who would it serve? Why?</em>
To separate the wheat from the chaff in the world of fonts. This would benefit users by letting them find well made ones (and understand why they are well made). It would benefit Type design novices, hobbyists, students and others seeking feedback on the composition. It would benefit Professional designers by exposing the greatness of fonts worthy of it, and (hopefully) decreasing consumer demand for bad fonts. Optimally it would benefit type culture in general, by offering a consensus opinion of what people like/want/respect. Why? Because it is a resource I would love to draw on, and others might as well. Most font sites are shopping centers that say everything is wonderful about every font, or they are just free font archives.
If it was a rounded enough user base, and rankings were fair and the process transparent, the ratings could be very worthwhile. I would love to be able to market a font as a "5 Star" or such, myself.
<em>Naming is fun, and all, but wouldn’t it be worth discussing the mechanics of the thing?</em>
Actually, I just figured that people here would be more into naming ideas than into the mechanics. From some previous work in two other fields, I've got a storm of interesting ideas for implementing a user-friendly reputation economy to "power" the voting/rating process. And I do not have enough to submit a design document on it yet. Seeing if people are even slightly interested lets me consider if this is worthwhile. My programming skills are not enough to code this by hand alone today, and that may limit the core features. Of course, there are lots of interesting FOSS modular web tools out there too...
<em>How are fonts to be selected for evaluation? Who would be eligible to vote? Would everyone’s vote count equally, or would specially qualified experts hold greater sway?</em>
I think that the method for submission should be limited to "controlling" parties, as determined by license. A designer or vendor could submit any of their own work, for sure. A public domain piece could be submitted by any registered user. Those "in-between" would have to be puzzled out. Currently undetermined: the time/scale for adding fonts for review. Probably couldn't be determined until
All methodology would be listed on the site. Full disclosure allows everyone equal chance to understand, and contribute to stopping exploits.
Vote weighting? That's a very tricky issue,and some people get quite riled, "experts count double???!?!OMG WTF" I would rather have a system that weights the votes towards those who contribute short reviews explaining their numeric decisions, and those who don't vote arbitrarily, as determined by their frequency of falling outside a pre-announced truncated mean. All weighting methods would have limits, so that no avenue(s) gives infinite vote-power, will still crediting those most competent.
Another idea is allowing one to specialize their vote. Are you a master of notanic balance, but have no interest or experience with uncial forms? Then you could tailor your own vote power to be greater in one category than the other.... No idea how to code this in to a site, but I've had great results and user satisfaction with this in RL situations.</div>

<div class=commentbody>So it would be discusion board in some sense like this one but it would have a Netflix style rating system with all the topics: this fonts or that. Hmmmmm I kinda like the idea. I am not sure though.
This is very ivory tower of me I know, but for me it is almost always a typo-rati's opinions that I find count in the end. So for my part I suggest that you have a two tier rating system with a popular opinion eg 'the great unwashed rabble' if you will. Ok just kidding. You could just call it popular opinion. Good enough.
But then I think it would be good if you also had folks who were authoritative or quasi-authoritative who would go ahead & rate things for you. Then you could have Comic Sans and get two very different ratings. Maybe. But the point is you could read the comments in either track. Frankly I think both kinds of opinions are useful. Very useful in fact. But they are much more useful when they are divided than mixed.
In fact the more separations you could make the more useful the data. The data could be agrigate so nobody is made to answer for loving or not loving Helvetica. But you could know for instance that type designers perhaps love it less than graphic designers or whatever. See where I am going with this? If you can offer the type community good meaningful data that would be really worthwhile.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>But you could know for instance that type designers perhaps love it less than graphic designers or whatever</em>
The great washed rabble filtering system could work. It would require something like a user selecting from a limited set of choices for occupation or interests, but I would certainly put higher granularity in the software and graphic design sectors. Then, one could filter by that, and get a different set of numbers. I would really love to see which faces are "type designer's choice" versus a "management's choice". Likewise, very useful information could come from knowing the popularity in 18-28 year olds, among students, or from Swedes, or any of a wide number of factors.
<em>The data could be agrigate so nobody is made to answer for loving or not loving Helvetica.</em>
I would like it to expose a user's choices as much as they want. And the more they choose to be open, the more they "weigh" in. To a point. To reduce people filling in garbage profiles, I am considering ways of unlocking voting power, or otherwise maturing an account, so that having a detailed identity is more useful to anybody.

<div class=commentbody>Those who submit designs for review should at least be given a higher voting rank than those who do not. Seems one should not be called a type designer without that minimal proof, at least in the context of this thingy.

<div class=commentbody><em>But at the same time, one should not be allowed to vote on their own submissions. </em>
Some people will create dummy accounts to pad things, no matter what. Making a fresh account less "worthy" helps eliminate that. A type designer shouldnt vote their own work, but that gets complicated on multiperson project, vendor submission, etc. Better to create a culture where that is just not okay, and let the users "shoot down" that sort of stuff via 'question this vote' type technology. And perhaps give a designer a special status that is outside the voting, but with another power to compensate, like featured status on that page or such.</div>

The <a href=http://typophile.com/node/29240>Hrant-coined</a> "despotype" may also be appropriate, but I was kinda thinking of that as the nexus for releasing my Christian Gothic and Zeno revivals.
There is already a fontornot at ning.com, but other than that, it seems like it communicates the idea clearly.
honestfonts.com is available. You could always use 2002 as a third-level domain.

That is slick, subtle, hip and clever, in its play of the vote=value idea. I haven't even checked to see if it is available, since it is not that obscure. Definitely a right idea.
<em>But if every type designer voted for his own submission, in the end things would even out, wouldn’t they?</em>
Yes. But i don't want it as simple as a +/- vote. I would like to see consensus reviews. If there are enough designers and users, it wont matter. But I'd also rather have a designer not vote, than stress on judging themselves "fairly".
<em>openfontlibrary.org</em>
I really like that tag cloud, better than most. Its value, as planned, as a PD font archive will become a nice resource someday. Not sure if anyone is doing quite what I am talking about yet, but something as similar to rottentomatoes.com as to abstractfonts.com
<em>“despotype”</em> is indeed awesome. Not quite a open, democratic font review webmagazine sounding name, but god is he right someone has to do something with it. Perhaps it should be the name of the DRM "emhanced" OpenType replacement spec.

<div class=commentbody>There are too many to review each above individually, and some are used already. I think that they can all approximately be grouped into 4 (overlapping) categories, or close. There are 'news' style, 'type' industry terms, 'puns' that are lighthearted and lend to a certain visual style, and there are ones that express the 'polling' nature.
The entries show the fontgeist well. I see no harm in people offering more suggestions, but I also think we have enough here to work with. Which category would people prefer? I think we should go for something that looks good when referenced elsewhere, sounds inviting, and not too unclear to the layperson.
Aboutface is rockin', but taken. And to non-experts, it isn't super clear, thought it would probably be fine in context, and made up for by its cleverness.
BTW, if anyone noticed, I'm having some very major issues with my server move (for exactly the reasons I am moving) so things are a bit held up while I sort things, and rebuild some sites. :( My email is down too.</div>

<div class=commentbody>*After a night of "discussing" several fine dark beers and "debating" personal political responsibility in a post-postmodern existence with friends...
<em>So, Choz, what do you want to do next? Take a vote on a shortlist of available/affordable names?</em>
Yes. Once we have a consensus on which direction to focus the shortlist in. But I was hoping to stall long enough to get my other web affairs in more order first. According to ICANN this could take 7 days, but should be less.
To tide you over, I have another, much drier, type related project coming soon (as in several days away). More on that later, or track my threads. ;) All part of !Exclamachine's "Make the world a letter place" campaign...
<em>Couldn’t you find someone like Veer to bankroll the startup costs...[?]</em>
Possibly. I hadn't even considered it. If I were on the outside, considering investing, I would like to see that what I am investing in will get it right and make something worthy, beforehand. Veer may be more risk-oriented than me, but I doubt it. Nevertheless, still a good idea. I am (for today) more worried about getting a good thing going (community) than who will sponsor it. Despite my interest in my own foundry, I am <em>very</em> interested in type culture.
I'd rather settle for the second best name choice and make it into the number one choice before I pay anyone's money on the scale of aftermarket domains. However, should I(we?) decide to invite sponsors later, that can be done easily with the power of allowing sponsors in on an opportunity they'd be silly to pass.
<em>Why can’t it just be part of Typophile instead of starting a new site...</em>
It could, but the technical parts of running different engines (the existing forums vs. the proposed relational index) could be <em>very</em> tricky. Also, I would like to embrace a broader opinion than would be found here.
I also assume Punchcut would also have to approve it, and, while they well might, they might not, too. I am grateful enough to them for allowing us this great chat arena, and don't want to ask any more of them. Additionally, I don't see the proposed site as a competitor, as the crit forums here are an excellent place for feedback on the development phase, whereas I am proposing something targeted at documenting completed and released fonts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I suspect that some foundries are dying for a neutral journalistic place to get exposure for their fonts, but I am well aware that that is intimidating to some, as well. I am apprehensive to see what happens when I release one next month, despite it being everything I could want in a face.
Nevertheless, if there are some of you wondering how to get in on some-font-review-site.com @ the ground floor, have your people talk to my, uh, person. ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Something that may help focus the shortlist of names is how the name will be seen and used beyond the website itself.
The site's font ranking scores would probably spread into the wider design community in the way Choz has already suggested.
THE TYPE SITE
| * | * | * | * | * |
FIVE STAR FONT
Foundries and type resellers could put the sites award logo/link next to a font that had a 5 star rating. The ranking award could get seen all over the web and beyond. That would in turn promote the site, raise it's status and make it possible to generate revenue through adverts and links to type resellers. Hopefully.
Even with that in mind I'm still not sure if a self explanatory type related name would be more suitable, or if a truly original and fun word/pun would attract more attention and be more distinctive and memorable in the long term, like say Google or Yahoo.
Obviously the site's independent, impartial and democratic status will be crucial in making its ranking awards worthy and authorative. That may affect who is chosen to sponsor the site or advertise on it.
It's a bit of a shame the site couldn't be an extension of Typophile, as there seems to be lots of respect for the impartial and expert advice, opinions and members here. I imagine there would still be a lot of two way traffic though.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Maybe those responsible for Typophile (I'm ashamed to say I don't know who you are) would be intereseted in a close associtation with Choz's website. It could be mutually beneficial. They could work as separate domains and sites but have lots of linkage and shared info.
Thinking about that gave me what might be a good idea. I know it's very presumptuous, and I don't mean to upset the Typophile team, but I couldn't resist doing this...
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TypographLogo_5698.gif]
As you can see it's an idea for the ranking award for a five star font that could be used beyond the site and work as a link back to the site.
I'm not saying the name is brilliant, but for the Typophile connection to work it may be good if the name was Typo-something.
I do quite like the name Typograph though. As well as the obvious meaning of graph there is graph as in measuring the standard of a font and graph as in telegraph for telling people about it.

<div class=commentbody>fontscale: also has that multiple meaning going for it. That and typescale are both available, but I'm not sure I care for how they sound out loud. Try it.
Fontgroove: I like it. No idea why, but I do.

Also thought of a few more, despite myself. One of these I adore enough to almost get right now, but will wait for the crowd reaction.

<div class=commentbody>Typosium
Wikipedia: "Symposium originally referred to a drinking party (the Greek verb sympotein means "to drink alot") but has since come to refer to any academic conference, whether or not drinking takes place. The sympotic elegies of Theognis of Megara, two Socratic dialogues, Plato's Symposium and Xenophon's Symposium all describe symposia in the original sense."</div>

<div class=commentbody>It sure seems to be a long way to Typearary....
Comicsans.com is taken (good grief), but noarial.com and nohelvetica.com are available. ;-)
I like fontgroove (it's available, and Roget's lists groove as a synonym for type), and I think that something with "font" in it would be more meaningful to a general audience (if that's what's wanted) than something with "type." Seems to me that the great unwashed rabble -- to borrow a phrase used earlier -- think in terms of fonts, not type. So font-something if the target is the lay audience, type-something for the typophile community. In which case, typosium is pretty good and is available. Hmm, what about typarilla (from camarilla)? Sounds like an 800 pound something.
Since I started the thread that inspired Hrant's despotype, I feel kind of bad about the name being unavailable. So if the community seems close to a consensus, I volunteer to register the name or names and hold them in trust until a formal body exists to reassign the name(s) to. But it should happen soon, because a lot of good names have already been suggested that someone could snap up.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>that something with “font” in it would be more meaningful to a general audience</em>
Though the term had a different meaning in the past, due to the way type faces are split into font files today, I think "font" is not such a sloppy or innacurate term as some. Even amongst the specialized audience, I think that *-font-* is better at describing the subject matter of digital scalable typeface products, whereas *-type-* suggest typography and letter arts in general. Since I want to have this be about software, then *-font-* is the way to go. (edit, unless its awesome great exception)
<em>Since I started the thread that inspired Hrant’s despotype, I feel kind of bad about the name being unavailable.</em>
I suspect that Raph *might* even be happy to offer the domain to a group that wanted to use it for this, but I predict his current intentions are actually more along the lines Hrant was shooting for.
<em>So if the community seems close to a consensus, I volunteer to register the name or names and hold them in trust until a formal body exists to reassign the name(s) to.</em>
As the de facto ringleader, I was planning to do likewise. And...
<em>But it should happen soon, because a lot of good names have already been suggested that someone could snap up.</em>
I have specifically tried to not become attached to any single name, as it could be grabbed any moment by a misanthrope just to throw things. Likewise, from the above suggestions, and the responses to them, I will choose something tonight, so, flip through the above and "last call for comments!"

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, Gus, I'm a little concerned too. Could be paranoia, but I think with good reason.
I'm pretty certain that when I checked 'www.typograph.info' yesterday it was available, but now it's under construction in Germany. Hmmm. This thread is a perfect source for domain squatters to grab good names they already know someone may be interested in.
I've got another list of possible type/font related names, but now I'm cautious of posting them here. Even if Choz wasn't to use them they could still be good for some other type related site and it would be a shame if a web parasite got hold of them first.
What to do? Any suggestions anyone?

<div class=commentbody>Yes, Despotype is registered to me, and yes, if Choz felt that the name was perfect for what he was trying to do, then I will happily give it over. But I guess that another name will rise to the top, and, if so, I will probably use it for releasing a few of my own fonts, which I believe is more or less consistent with Hrant's intentions when proposing the name. I agree - real domain scammers, looking only to harvest googlejuice or extort money, are among my least favorite net people.
The name "fonticello" just popped into my head. A bit America-centric in its references, perhaps, but at least it rolls off the tongue trippingly.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hiro,
Don't mind me, it was a curse that was passed on to me from my ancestors. I guess when my teachers wondered if I ever would "get serious", they had a point :-)

PS: good choice Wormwood!</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm shocked. I'm stunned. I'm overjoyed and deeply humbled. You don't know how much this means to me, sob, sob, sniff.
But this honour doesn't just belong to me. There are many others I have to thank...
My Mother and Father, wherever they are. The nuns at the orphanage, for their selfish devotion to duty. My old headmaster, for beating some sense into me. The ruthless inspiration of my inglish teecha. My first girlfriend, Desiree, for showing me her amazing *****. My scout master for explaining the differnece between a camp fire and a forest fire. My Uncle Betty for revealing an, ahem, alternate side of life. My driving instructor for the wisdom of not reversing on a dual carriageway. Bob for fixing the central heating. My credit card company, for their understanding in times of...
...23 minutes later...
...and finally the eternal love and wonderful innocence of my beautiful young 7th wife ..., hey, wait a ****** minute, where's my ****** award?

<div class=commentbody>1) Don't worry, that's not a real logotype, I just wanted something grand for the announcement. Wormy, you won all the methods. The reaction here was positively yours. I bugged my friends with the shortlist, and it was sorta mixed. In the early morning "total strangers at Krystal's" tie-breaker, however, you had it by a landslide. I wanted the lay person's reaction to not using "font", and it flew.
2) Prize details here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-Prize
We have decided to serve you better with electronic communications, and the award should already be in your email inbox.
3) I hope everyone involved here on the thread has had their interest piqued! There is much still to do, such as determining the method of reviewing decorative, display and text fonts harmoniously, or if this is even a good idea.
4) Ok, you do deserve a prize of some sort so here it is. I decided to save costs again, so this is from a spec "contest" on mostbestestgraphics.ru. I've promised to pay them based on how much you or I like it, whichever is less:

<div class=commentbody>Thanx, Choz. You shouldn't have. No, I really mean that ;)
However, I don't think the cartoon totally meets my vague and conflicting expectations of an award. So the Russian's get nothing.
I hope the website becomes a success for you.
And I hope you'll retain the antiquarian Greek philosopher aspect of a symposium. Hic! Buurrrrp! The beers are on you at the first Typosium Symposium Nashville 2008.
Here's some Typosium ranking 'five star font award' logos I couldn't resist knocking up. I always go overboard at a projects conception stage, even if it's not my own :)

I actually thought of the 'T dagger' device for the Typecutter name I suggested.

<div class=commentbody>Choz, very nice job on the placeholder graphic at typosium.com. Somehow, it speaks to the feeling of an ancient Greek symposium (maybe the gradient?).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you much. :) That was just a quickie that probalby tells exactly what software I have installed, to the keen FontID'er. I like Wormwood's "Dogbone" logtype, but am not really ready to think about the look of Typosium, so I figured a mix of fonts would be appropriate without feeling too committal!
I have created a "Department of Planning" forum over at <a href=http://typosium.org>http://typosium.org</a> to begin the discussion regarding what it is and how it works. So far there is a manifesto I hope to evolve into a mission statement, and a I am now working on describing some technologies/concepts/terms that I think will make the whole thing work.</div>
