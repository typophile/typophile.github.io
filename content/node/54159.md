  I fell in love last year in Mrs. Bernardo's class. :) She is an elegant and graceful
  typeface, meant to flow across the page effortlessly. \r\n\r\nCreated by Eric Gill
  and released in 1932, Perpetua has a long story to tell. Along the way Gill didn't
  know for sure if this would be the typeface he would release. He had another offer
  from another company for her sister font, Felicity. The time, scheduling, and mismanagement
  worked out in Perpetua's favor. \r\n\r\nGill named her after Saint Perpetua who
  was one of the first martyrs to die for Christianity. It took nearly 8 years of
  meticulous work to to be able to produce such a beautiful typeface to suit such
  an honorable woman. In the end he produced a masterpiece that is still unique and
  timeless today. \r\n\r\nKnowing Saint Perpetua's story as well as the sketchy business
  related background that went into this typeface, I had to share its story as well
  as choose it as my favorite."

    one on the block though. August to the max.\r\n\r\nBTW, we don't \"invent\" typefaces.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Oh, well in my research I found that Perpetua was named after a Christian
    martyr and its sister font, Felicity, that was being created at the same time
    by Gill (but I don't believe its ever  been released) was named after a co-martyr
    of Perpetua's from the same time period, who met the same end. But I will look
    into the Roman style named after a man. \r\nThank you,\r\nJessica"
