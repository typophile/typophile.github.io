  forums because i realy think typophile is of the most interest. :) i have to thank
  you for all i've learned here!\r\nso, i'd like to share with you an idea:\r\nI have
  recently started teaching tipography history to adult students in a professional
  school, and i felt an enormous difficulty in transmiting to them the importance
  of tipography (some of them, before these classes, had never thought about letters...)\r\nwell,
  to make it simple, i made an experiment with friends and i wanted to know what do
  you think about this before i try it with my students:\r\nstep one: close your eyes
  and think of a random set of numbers (ex. 123) - imagine their graphic apearence
  in you head.\r\nstep two: draw them on a piece of paper, with all the graphic characteristics
  you imagined (with serifs or without them, thin or bold, condensed or stretched...)\r\nstep
  three: try to find out, in your everyday lives, something that might have influenced
  you in those graphic images.\r\n.\r\ni don't know if this sounds strange to you...
  i got answers that surprised me. We got to the conclusion that the numbers we drew
  were influenced by, for exemple, the lettering of the numbers in our mobile phones,
  the lettering of the house numbers in our street, or the tipography of the last
  book we read.\r\n.\r\nthis means (i think) that we assimilate the graphic images
  around us, and that they change in the course of time, in our unconscient.\r\n.\r\ni
  think it would be interesting to try it also with the \"image\" of our name :)\r\n.\r\nthank
  you in advance for your thoughts on this!"

    and transparency of the written form.\r\nHowever, I find quite depressing they
    were impressed by mobile phones' numerals\u2026"

    pic up such an unimpressing thing has mobile numerals... we never know... that
    was my conclusion. \r\nit was funny to do this with different people, from different
    \"lives styles\", and different levels of awareness to typography :)"
