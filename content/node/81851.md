  body: "The inline font at the top is called Skin & Bones and as far as I am concerned
    there is no digital version commercially available.\r\nBut I have a home-made
    digitization, so could help you setting the text and emailing you a vector file."

  body: Hi Seb, thanks very much for that, I found a free download of Skin and Bones
    at Fonts101.com and although some of the drawing is a bit wonky it saved me hours.
    Couldn't have done it without your help, you are a star.
