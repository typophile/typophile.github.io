body: "Introductions all around:\r\nHello, I've been a lurker once removed for a while,
  now. My spouse is a frequent poster, Chris Rugen, and I'm nosy, so I've given the
  site a look. I've been working on a business card for my new professional incarnation.
  \r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nI am currently an interior designer for IKEA.\r\nI used to
  be a freelance set designer and scenic artist (plenty of lettering).\r\nI am now
  taking classes in graphic and web design, so I can start forcing Chris to split
  his fees when I help him on a project. :)\r\nI have a terminally crafty streak and
  I'm trying to play that up.\r\n\r\nI used the typefaces Nasty, CA Aires, European
  Pi, and CA After Midnight Sale Junk. Once I have better mastery of Illustrator,
  I have dreams of switching out the image of the stylized woman and tossing my own
  silhouette in there.\r\n\r\nHere it is:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buscard_webOCT2005.jpg]\r\nComments
  and suggestions welcome."

  body: I like the card it has a wonderful retro feel. I'm not convinced about the
    word Artisan. Why not just Designer or Artist

    card.\r\n\r\nThere nothing about the card the says business, and for that matter
    nothing about the card says design, ( actual word \"design\" noted ).\r\n\r\nTo
    me it looks like it's all about ALISA, which is ok by me.\r\n\r\n\r\nHiroshige"

  body: "I would be interested in seeing the grid you are working with.\r\n\r\nSometimes
    grunge can be nice. What would make this better is if the grunge could be bound
    to something a little more organized. A strict grid might accomplis this. Or possibly
    some 'cleaner' elements.\r\n\r\nRepeating the A in the grunge font is a bit too
    much of a good thing. It kills the impact of the type treatment for the name.\r\n\r\nLoose
    the silhouette, it accomplishes nothing -- in fact it is actually confusing.\r\n\r\nDevelop
    a (more visible) grid. Allow it to dictate your elements size and placement. Introduce,
    or change some of the elements to something more organized or 'clean.' Be prepared
    to to have a solid explaination for the moniker 'design artisan.'\r\n\r\nOhh,
    and welcome to Typophile. ;)"

  body: "I don't see anything wrong with this per se - It's cheeky & fun and the word
    'artisans says ( to me) that you also want to good work & that your serious about
    that. The split seems to be:\r\n\r\n not serious about yourself / serious about
    your work.\r\n\r\nIf I was offering you this design I would want to be clear about
    what you want the card to do for you. If you wanted to appear to be more serious
    yourself, which other folks seem to be suggesting you should and which I am not
    so sure about yet, then yes you would have to be more grid-y or something. Given
    the exuberence of the card I have a hard time imagining that could be your intent.
    Still, I don't really know because you haven't said - yet."

  body: "Ha ha! Yes - Welcome indeed! I think Hiroshige makes a good point in that
    the card doesnt give off a sense of 'design'. To me, I see something more like
    'vintage clothing' or 'antiques' (possibly the background 'A' making me think
    this).\r\n\r\nI expect the design is monotone for a reason, and there is nothing
    wrong with that at all, but could maybe small splash of colour help lift it?"

  body: David makes good points. I agree with his observations about the feeling of
    the card. It does feel vintage clothing-ish. To put a less fine point on it, it
    feels casual.

    you thought about mimicking your pattern effects on the back?

    maybe you could try Great Circus, also by Eduardo Recife. From a technical point
    of view having equal tight margins can be a challenge for printers. The dot in

  body: "Thank you all for giving one of my first official print designs a look-see.
    I would like to address some of the comments you've made.\r\n\r\nthe term Design
    Artisan\r\nI struggled with this term as well. My reasoning is that I am, at the
    moment, inbetween professional directions. If I hand this card out to someone,
    I would like it to be able to emphasize to my potential client or contact that
    I am in a sense, a creative Jack-of-all-Trades. I work with a variety of media,
    and consider myself more of a craftsperson, than a designer or an artist.\r\n\r\nInformality
    (business vs. introduction)\r\nI want my potential client to be under no illusions
    as to the feeling of the product they will be getting: something with thought
    behind it, a hand crafted feel to the work, and perhaps a more playful approach
    than they might otherwise find. I do understand that this may limit my potential
    clientele. \r\n\r\nA Grid\r\nHonestly I have very little experience with grids
    (alright, no experience). I found your comments very interesting, and because
    of your post, I nagged Chris into giving me a quick introduction to the baseline
    and layout grid. I do think that the small amount of information in the actual
    card makes a grid unnecessary. The work I have done, thus far, has tended towards
    an optically placed collage. I look forward to exploring the grid as a tool and
    an integral part of my design work. Thanks for the advice.\r\n\r\nProduction\r\nThis
    card design stemmed from my decision to jump head first into Illustrator with
    almost no knowledge of the program. My purpose was to make a card that would suite
    my immediate needs for introduction, which I think this design achieves for the
    short term. I printed them on pre-punched card stock that can only be printed
    on one side. I hope to experiment with a double sided design some point in the
    future.  Great point, thanks.\r\n\r\nI am amazingly busy with a combination of
    classes, work, and some small print projects for my synagogue's annual auction,
    but I fully plan on trying out some of your suggestions (Great Circus, a simpler
    composition, a descriptor for my \"title\", a more methodical grid, double sided
    comp). Well, lots to explore. I'll be sure to post what I come up with, but it
    may be a while. \r\n\r\np.s. you know I heard somewhere that Philly is the new
    Brooklyn... so don't knock it (thank goodness that's a boldfaced lie)"

  body: "Hi Chris! I told Alisa all about our time hanging out. Don't worry, she won't
    judge you too harshly.  ;)  But seriously, I had a good time talking with you
    and sampling some of the local cuisine. Perhaps if you're in Boston next year
    I'll have a font to show you, as well.\r\n\r\nDan, I just wish there was a way
    I could convince the client to let me <em>double</em> my fees...\r\n\r\nAlisa's
    design aesthetic and problem-solving sensibility is well reflected in her card,
    and that's why we're starting to collaborate more formally. We balance each other
    out. I'm more methodical, gridded, type-centric, etc. She's a burst of visual
    and creative activity, but always with a purpose and a concept. It's pretty cool.\r\n\r\n(OK,
    I'm done bragging about my wife.)\r\n\r\nAll of the comments here are great and
    have fed creative debate between the two of us about her cards. That's why I love
    Typophile."
