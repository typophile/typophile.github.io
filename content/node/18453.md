body: "Hello,\r\nGenerally I am appalled at the poor use of type. Lousy design/designers
  tend to hide behind the latest typographical whimsy and they date so quickly. I
  was around in the pre-Mac/Pc days and  some designers rarely used \"different\"
  fonts. The reasons were multiple, but some of the best designers would use a particular
  font family or two and learn its strengths and weaknesses and exploit its quirks,
  and begin to bond with the fonts, the rules could be broken and the excellent design
  was evident, while thinking about the fonts became 2nd nature. Obviously, over time
  the work becomes dated, but far slower than \"Fashion of the times\" mentality of
  today.\r\n\r\nThe relationship with a typesetter/typographer was still strong, and
  designers relied on good input from the type shop, \"we think that this would look
  better\u2026 we will send a sample, let us know.\"\r\n\r\nI have been toying with
  the idea of 2 fonts for 1 year (actually two font famililes) for my personal work.
  Picking the right fonts is daunting, you do not want to be tied with 2 dullards
  or 2 whackos either. It is kind of like finding a wife or husband, which one is
  right for me? I think I found them too. Fonts I can afford, but are not like everybody
  else, URW Antiqua and URW Grotesk (both from the TypeWorks Library) are my front
  runners, but I also love Antique Olive family and Caslon buch (Berthold), Formata
  is nice but I have a hard time paring it up. I know for a fact that Univers and
  Bauer Bodoni work great together, but I would have directly stolen it from a great
  designer that I did work for, and I would feel totaly unoriginal, no brain waves,
  you know what I mean? \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRodrigue Planck\r\n"

    is that there aren't too many good fonts \u2014 so if people design many typefaces,
    there are chances that every now and then a new *good* one is created. But altogether,
    master Frutiger\u2019s point is valid: Are so many wines necessary? You can think
    of less exquisite goods \u2014 how about clothing? Are so many dresses necessary?
    I could imagine a party where each woman is wearing either dress model A or dress

  body: "Christian, I have to disagree with you. I think that this could be a very
    interesting project. If Rodrigue removes \"typeface selection\" from his design
    equation, he is left to make his work with a wider open playing field for all
    of the other factors.\r\n\r\nI am reminded of two Northern California residents:\r\n\r\nSteve
    Jobs wears the same outfit all of the time: Black mock turtleneck shirt and jeans.
    And you have to admit that his creative talents as CEO of Apple and Pixar have
    led both of those companies to great heights.\r\n\r\nRudy vanderLans worked for
    years in Ready,Set,Go!, a basic page layout program. I remember reading a statement
    from Rudy which I will paraphrase: The program wasn't able to rotate text or do
    a lot of other things, so I was left to make the design interesting within those
    limits. (Apologies to Rudy for completely slaughtering his words.)\r\n\r\nAnd
    I agree with Adam that it's not the quantity of typefaces which is at issue, it
    is their quality. I am guilty of much bad work, some mediocre work, and some good
    work. But I have yet to produce anything truly Great with a capital G. 100 years
    ago, it was such a massive undertaking to bring a new typeface design to market
    that only the strong made it. (Objectively.) Now, it's extremely easy to self-publish
    type, but the number of Great designs released has not increased proportionately.\r\n\r\nSo,
    to get around to the question: no, so many fonts aren't \"necessary\", but the
    increase in numbers still results in the good and Great stuff percolating to the
    top. "

  body: "Christian, \r\n\r\nof course what I said \"I could imagine a party where
    each woman is wearing either dress model A or dress model B or dress model C,
    period\", I was kidding. The human nature knows two trends: unification and individualization.
    They co-exist in a ying-yang\r\nway. If I were Desmond Morris, I'd say humans
    are just herding animals. We like to develop \"individualized groups\" -- one
    army usually has uniforms of some sort but they should be different from the opponent's
    uniforms. One corporation likes to use the same corporate typeface (color, graphic
    element) in all their communication and that typeface (color, graphic element)
    should be different from the competitor's. \r\n\r\nThat's just one point, pretty
    obvious. The other point is specific to typeface design: I do believe there is
    still room for improvement in typeface design, even in the Latin writing system,
    although I kind of doubt that a whole lot of invention can happen in the formal
    language of the typeface. But the form is only one of the elements of a font.
    The extensiveness -- or perhaps should I say, completeness -- of character sets
    is another one, the quality and consistency of spacing is yet another. \r\n\r\nI
    recently spoke with a friend who does book layout in Poland, mostly scientific
    publications and fiction. His studio designed and typeset around 1,000 books so
    far, and he's still unhappy with the small set of workhorse typefaces he's working
    with. He can produce large lists of errors that are included in the leading foundries'
    \"Pro\" OpenType fonts. (If you ever design a \"workhorse\"-type OpenType font
    suitable for typesetting Central European languages and would like to have some
    critique from the utilitarian point of view, let me know and I'll get you in touch.)
    \r\n\r\nTo me, a good font has three components that can compete: the stylistic
    component, the linguistic component and the technical component. Many designers
    like to compete in \"form\" because they see typefaces as means ofartistic expression.
    Many of them compete only in the area of glyph design, which is even a subset
    of the stylistic component. Things like letterspacing, linguistic quality and
    technical quality are often considered secondary -- although things changed a
    lot in the last years. My personal campaign \"make your ogoneks right\" is of
    course only an exemplification of this thinking. \r\n\r\nA."

    garbage.\r\n\r\nAs for working within constraints, that's cool. It's true that
    sometimes forcing yourself to use a limited combination of types lets you explore
    the relationships between the forms. But sometimes it's just boring. And besides,
    modernism is over. Well, it's back, but as pastiche. Ironic."

  body: "I think what Rodrigue is getting at is pretty simple, and a very good point:
    type selection should be guided by a strong design sense. I think that's the whole
    issue. How many fonts there \"are\" makes no difference. Whether you like to hang
    out and get to know just a few pair, or if you prefer to scan through scores at
    a time to pinpoint a few that you like this week-- that makes no difference. You
    need the knowledge and good sense of typographic design either way, if you hope
    to get to type nirvana. I am reminded of an essay by Philip Meggs, \"The Obscene
    Typography Machine\" way back in 1994:\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, the ease of computer
    use puts potent graphic capabilities into the hands of people who are devoid of
    any aesthetic sense about typography and have little or no understanding of the
    most basic principles of design. Powerful new software programs... give the designer
    (or moron, as the case may be) the power to flip, rotate, stretch, or bend typography
    with the click of a mouse button. This permits some of the most obscene type forms
    ever devised or imagined.\" (160)\r\n\r\n(in <em>Looking Closer: Critical Essays
    on Graphic Design</em>, pub. Allworth 1994, the first of two \"Looking Closer\"
    books and highly recommended)\r\n\r\nAnd, I think it's important to remember that
    good design sense, accompanied with healthy curiosity and a half a brain, is what
    leads people beyond the limited palette of the very popular but visual cliche
    Arial, TNR, Brush Script, and Comic Sans. Imagine if you applied the principle
    of limiting one's palette (like in painting class, where you work in monochrome
    before tackling color) to THOSE. I mean, hey, they offer very obvious workhorse
    examples of sans-serif, serif, \"decorative,\" and \"informal.\" Perfect, right?
