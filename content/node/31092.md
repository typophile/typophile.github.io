  platform and Windows XP, but in Windows Vista the Western Diacritics are cut off.
  Can anyone think of a reason why this might be.\r\n\r\nc. "

  body: "Generally clipping is caused by an incorrect WinAscent value. The WinAscent
    and WinDescent are the highest and lowest values in the WinANSI character set
    (original spec definition).  \r\n\r\n1. is the font PostScript based outlines
    output as an .otf file? \r\n2. What application are you using?\r\n\r\nI doubt
    Vista is using a different method of height calculation since the WinDesent and
    WinAscent and many other metric information goes back to the original bitmap formats
    in most operating systems and these usually are kept so they don't break existing
    'things'."

    Quark, etc.? And does \"cut off\" mean completely missing or present, but not
    completely (e.g. half gone)?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Obviously Vince has a much better idea
    of how these things work, so feel free to ignore my questions for his."

  body: "vinceconnare \r\n\r\nHow do apply the correct WinAscent value?\r\n\r\nWhy
    is this just a problem in Vista ?\r\n\r\nYes it's a OTF font, and it seems to
    occur in most applications.\r\n\r\n"

    values in the 'font info' \r\n\r\nif it is a TrueType based font you could run
    it through the Microsoft Font Validator and it will kick up a bunch of errors
    that probably will relate to the heights in the 'OS/2' table. \r\n\r\nIf the font
    is CFF based OTF then it's not going to work in the Validator.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/truetype_3471.jpg]\r\n\r\nthe
    font is in 1000 units.\r\n\r\np.s. I'm still waiting for my copy of Vista to be
    sent so don't have it yet or the new Office."

  body: "\"Most applications\" is not very specific or helpful. Please name specific
    applications it does or does not occur in! We need to know if these are GDI applications,
    WPF applications, or CoolType applications....\r\n\r\nIt probably is a usWinAscent
    problem. Or more accurately, an application problem, as many apps incorrectly
    use usWinAscent for clipping, in violation of the specifications since day 1.
    However, since this is a well-known application defect, font makers try to work
    around it. But without more info, we can't say for sure.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
