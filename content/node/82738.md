    same goes for the t.

  body: "I'm a beginner too just so you know. \r\n\r\nThis may just be my taste. But
    I find when designing anything, I tend to avoid using gradients whenever possible.\r\n\r\nEspecially
    with logotypes or typography, because I find that legibility is very important.\r\n\r\nThey're
    just too hard to replicate in mass production and unless they're done well, they
    can look cheesy.\r\n\r\nNot to say that the few letters I saw were cheesy. But
    if the entire font uses that gradation, it will seem cluttered and illegible.\r\n\r\nAnyways,
    the idea is very creative and I wish you all the best!\r\n\r\nGood luck, I'd love
    to see you make it work."
