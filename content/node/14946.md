  be held in Boston next July. Anyone in Boston/New England interested in volunteering
  and helping plan the conference should get in touch now. It's fun, relatively painless,
  and you can have a say in making TC06 the best [[TypeCon]] ever. We'll be coming
  to Beantown in October for planning meetings, but in the meantime, we're starting
  on programming, workshops, venues, design, tours, and much more.\r\n\r\nTo get involved,
  post here and/or email me privately at tamye /at/ typesociety.org, and I'll be in
  touch.\r\n\r\nNon-Bostonians are also very welcome and encouraged to volunteer and
  help create a wonderful event! We have such an amazing group of volunteers each
  year - I can't wait to work with old friends and new faces.\r\n"

    but very willing to lend a hand. I only live 20 mins. north of Boston. Let me
    know when you plan to be in town. We can keep in touch directly be email.\r\n\r\n>

    a new friend with an old face?\r\n\r\nNorbert"

  body: "I'm coming back next year, as I live in MA (Cape Cod) but don't know if I'll
    be volunteering again or fronting the money for a student pass. I didn't get to
    see as much as I wanted last time and if I'll be travelling that far, even if
    it is close to home (I'll be in Philly at school), I think I'd rather just see
    all the exhibits and presentations. Please tell me this is after July 15th (my
    21st bday). :D\r\n\r\n-Dave"

    legal. This will be a great opportunity to cadge birthday drinks (just ask Stewf)."
