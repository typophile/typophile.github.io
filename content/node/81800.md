body: 'Hello & happy month. I''m looking for friendly sans, with distinctive curves.
  I really like [[http://www.typegoodness.com/2009/09/aeroportal/|Aeroportal]], [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_cocon_offc_pro/|FF

  joy, culture and ancient, last one not necessary. thank you as always. '
