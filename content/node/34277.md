body: "I'm designing an 20's style art deco-ish cd and I'm thinking about using either
  silver ink or spot varnishing, but I've never really done something like this so
  I come to you guys for advice.<!--break-->\r\n\r\nThe cd for a musical based on
  the life of Peter Lorre. The cover art concept I was given is a play on an old grayscale
  poster of one of his movies with a dash of red thrown in. Since this was all we
  had at the beginning, I've been thinking about printing it in Black, PMS135 & Silver
  ink and have done my design so far in a way that could be converted to that. I posted
  <a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1357/533386131_54a522a53a_o.png\">a sample
  spread</a> (in progress! don't critique too much!) \r\n\r\nI was inspired by the
  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Spider-Fly-Mary-Howitt/dp/0689852894/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-0806386-0929754?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181143938&sr=8-2\">The
  Spider & the Fly</a>) children's book which states it was printed in a black & silver
  duotone, but I'm not sure quite what I'd want to do with it.\r\n\r\nWhen I went
  back to look at this book again, the effect wasn't as impressive as I thought. This
  got me thinking about spot varnishes. The look we're going for in the booklet is
  very rich black, lots of gradients multiplied over gradients, angular, art deco.\r\n\r\nSo
  it's kind of just me doing this, at least on the art direction side and since I've
  never done \"special inks\" I'd like to get other ideas or experiences. If we go
  with silver, would it be worth it? How noticeable would it be? If I do spot varnishes,
  where would I do them? The song titles? The black boxes? In different boxes to add
  another layer of fun confusion? What sort of spot varnish treatments have you loved?
  I really want this to look great and not just like some black ink on paper and I'm
  really flying solo in all these ideas because none of the other people I'm talking
  to/working with can envision it...so thank you all in advance for at least letting
  me bounce ideas off of you. \r\n\r\n"

- body: "you could use both silver and the spot varnish if you wanted. it still works
    out cheaper than having it printed in cmyk. just make sure you dont have a matte
    finish on the silver cuz that just looks like grey.\r\n\r\nanother option you
    could have is inverting the whites and blacks on your design to accomodate the
    silver spot varnish. which looks like blue/light-grey when printed onto white."

    to find, but couldn't, even going through Google.  hrumph.\r\n\r\nI like using
    spot varnishes (semi-gloss, on matte paper) over B/W photos to give that almost-sepia
    look: it's very effective when done properly (i.e., the varnish exactly matches
    the edges of the photo) and reasonably priced."

  body: Silver will be quite silver if printed on glossy paper, something like chromalux.
    When printed on matte paper, it looks kind off dull. I don't know if varnishing
    it helps. I guess if you want matte parts on glossy paper, you can print it with
    matte/satin varnish, but that I have never tried out.

    putting ink over a metallic. But I've done it. Even did black + metallic duotones.
    (In each case, the printer wanted to do a presstest first, before the actual press
    run.)\r\n\r\nThe new Metal F/X proprietary software may be another answer, if
    your printer has a license. Though I think that may be only for four-color work.
    (I've only had occasion to use it once, and it was on a four-color piece.)"

  body: "Okay, I was running late. I thought I should phone one of my favorite printers
    (one that has the Metal F/X license) to follow up on what I suggested in an earlier
    post. My printer's rep confirmed that Metal F/X only works with 4-C process, so
    that won't work, and then suggested printing on a silver paper. So we discussed
    silver papers and I got all excited and posted that. Then buggered off to my \"previous
    commitment\", which incidentally was an Open House at a local paper merchant.
    Halfway to the warehouse I realized that Tim had already suggested the silver
    paper technique. And now I'm feeling particularly stoopid, 'cause I had read Tim's
    post and thought he was offering good and sage advice, but in my excitement to
    report on what the printer's rep said, I completely forgot Tim's earlier post.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    while at the paper merchant's Open House I found another stock that would work
    swimmingly for your project: Wausau Paper's Chalice Silver 70 pound Text. As silvery
    as silver can be."

    choice I have over the stock. I think we might be going with one of those \"we

    stock\" according to their FAQ, and an \"80lb uncoated text stock\". )\r\n\r\nKen
    or Tim, do you know if I would be able to get samples from the paper company?
    We're actually running pretty tight on this (art is due next thursday, a week
    from today) so I'd need them very quickly and I wouldn't want to do it sight unseen.\r\n\r\nHow
    would red print over silver?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks Linda, that sort of example
    is very helpful. I'd be fine with doing 4c and just printing in a rich black but
    then I'd want to do spot varnishes...and I think I need more inspiration for using
    them in creative ways.\r\n\r\nHow would it look if every piece of text had a varnish
    over it? Would that be incredibly hard to read? Is it a bad idea? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you (or delivered if a rep is in your area), they will probably have samples with
    print on them, get on the phone, the limiting factor (apart from budget) might
    be the printer. IMO the varnish on text, apart from the technical difficulty,
    would hugely reduce the legibility of the text.\r\n\r\nTim"

    if anything, I'd varnish the entire piece except the text, so that the contrast
    would make it stand out.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, there are other places where it
    can be used effectively, such as instead of some sort of embosssing, a logo over
    an otherwise \"plain\" background, etc.  As always in cases like  this, talk to
    your printer rep, and they can provide excellent suggestions (well, mine always
    does!)."

  body: "I stay away from silver ink now unless it is a large swath - It just ends
    up looking white or gray. Silver foil, however, is wondeful. But I don't white
    see how it applies to this design and foil is a lot more expensive.\r\n\r\nThe
    idea about printing on metallic stock seems like the best one here.\r\n\r\nI've
    seen text with spot varnish over it - it's a nice effect but it definitely affects
    the legibility. In looking at this layout it doesn't seem like legibility is your
    first concern (no offense intended). It will be tough to get perfect alignment
    on all this text, especially the thinner deco typeface.\r\n\r\nBest of Luck!\r\n\r\npiece"

  body: "Brian: to get paper samples fast, talk to your printer. They probably have
    a cabinet full of samples and swatchbooks. (Or check your local paper merchant.)
    They'll also know if any of the papers are readily available. I don't know why
    they wouldn't be available to you. Shine is a product of Reich Paper, headquartered
    in Brooklyn. Wausau Paper is headquartered in Wisconsin. They both have websites
    (www. company name including the word \"paper\" as one word .com for both) but
    I find getting a feel for paper off a website is very difficult.\r\n\r\nTim: I
    used Metal F/X for the dust jacket of a photography book. Design was a very large
    photograph letterboxed with a fifth color (a warm grey) chosen to complement the
    palette of the photo. Client decided, at the last minute of course, to change
    the fifth color to their corporate color (basicly reflex blue with bit of magenta).
    I didn't like the new color combination and was bitching to the printer, who suggested
    that Metal F/X would bring the tonal range of the photo and the corporate color
    closer. It worked great as a compromise. Photo-Boy was okay with metallic sheen
    and changed color palette of his photo. Client agreed the metallic sheen was pretty,
    even though it wasn't his corporate color anymore.\r\n\r\nLex: Sorry, buddy. Didn't
    realize you were into paper. I'll let you know next time."

    than ordinary text, and heavier, but not too heavy. I woldn't suggest going smaller
    than a 12pt medium weight. And there of course would have to be a significant
    step between the varnish gloss and the paper finish. \r\n\r\nYou could also add
    texture with thermographic embossing, using the clear varnish as glue for the
    powder (instead of ink as is usually done). I've seen this done on packaging before.
    It's a pretty neat effect."

    For the secret messages, I was thinking really big, like 24pt or so. And by significant
    step, you mean in terms of brightness right? not like a production step of drying
    or sealing or something.\r\n\r\nSpoke with the printer, he said they have this
    new technology called \"One Shot\" that ends up being extremely similar to Spot
    UV but at a fraction of the cost. He's UPSing me samples I'll have tomorrow."

  body: Oh yeah, 24pt should be no problem. By "significant step" I meant in terms
    of relative sheen between the paper surface and the varnish. It would be somewhat
    useless to print your secret messages in matte varnish on matte stock, or in gloss
    varnish on glossy coated stock. But that all depends on just how "secret" you
    want your messages to be.
