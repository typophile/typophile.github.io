body: So I am looking to see if this font is available digitally. I found a sample
  in Graphics Master 8, eighth edition. But any search on google/myfonts yields nothing.
  Anyone ever seen this typeface in the wild? Or perhaps under a different name?

    version.\r\n\r\nEdit: Philippe from the MyFonts forum pointed out that Fontbank's
    <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/acappella.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Acapella</a>
    was their version of Acapulco Light - albeit with no alternates (there were many,
    originally, including three A's)."
