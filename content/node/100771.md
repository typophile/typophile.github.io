  enough for business essays and articles, etc... but also adds a mild touch of unique
  style...\r\n\r\nBut googling Tanger Serif doesn't bring up the various reviews normally
  found regarding other main stream typefaces...\r\n\r\nWas curious is anyone has
  had any publishing/design experience with Tanger Serif... and what their opinions
  might be..."

    likes it. This is how the type scene operates. The stuff no-one likes is usually
    shoved under the carpet. Sometimes an occasional sarcastic remark on Twitter."

  body: "What Frode says.. adding that also, some other gets reviews for marketing
    reasons. AFAIK some foundries pays extra $ to get featured in the distributor's
    email newsletters.\r\nAnother factor may be the \"news-nest\" of a font... almost
    nobody reviews old fonts, although there are many beautiful hidden gems. For example,
    this is one of those gems: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/zapf-renaissance-antiqua-sb/"

  body: "Thanks for the comments thus far... but maybe my question was mis-worded.
    What I was attempting to ask was NOT 'general information' about the Tanger Serif
    typeface (mostly what is found is written by the designer or Typolar corporately).
    \r\n\r\nBut rather, my question was about how other professionals rated or viewed
    the typeface. To my novice eye, it is an interesting typeface with a bit of character
    that mainstream formal typefaces do not seem to have. I tend to like unconventional
    serifs such as Mamontov by omtype or in this case Tanger Serif, even for formal
    corporate business reports, etc.\r\n\r\nSo... with the various typography blogs
    out there, I haven't seen much (if any) written about Tanger Serif, and was curious
    why this might be. Is it due to bad design of the typeface? Or bad marketing by
    Typolar? Or perhaps even that design professionals tend to remain loyal to 'safe'
    or 'mainstream' alternatives (such as something from Adobe, Linotype, et. al.)
    ?\r\n\r\nHope that clarifies my question. Thanks."

    Used by everybody and their neighbor's dog's groomer in the 90s. But seriously
    flawed. Exhibit #2: The \"typography\" (using the term quite loosely) of Avatar.
    I could go on until Pangaea reforms.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
