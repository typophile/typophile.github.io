  the typophiles think is a good type for <BR>faxing, type that doesn&#39;t suffer
  too much from the <BR>brutality of the faxing process. <BR> <BR>kris.

  body: ' PMN Caecilia is my studio&#39;s house font and I&#39;ve found that it survives
    the horrors of the fax machine quite well. <BR> <BR>you might also consider anything
    created for the rigors of news print &#40;try Unger&#39;s site or Garcia Media&#41;.
    just stay away from fine lines and cramped shapes -- you&#39;re ahead of the rest
    of the pack just for thinking of it. '

    to match, in a roundabout way, this: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/33839.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>Which is the new version of Eliza. I went back to the files
    <BR>after about five months and almost fell off my chair they <BR>were that bed.
    It is now looking more like I originally wanted <BR>it to.  <BR> <BR>kris.'

  body: Avoid serifs. Even Hrant&#39;s go-to low-res font Charter will get <BR>mangled
    by the fax. <BR> <BR>PC is right, thin lines and closed counters hurt the most.
    <BR> <BR>Try Gotham, Trade Gothic, Thesis, Interstate, Meta

    Peignot?  :-/ <BR> <BR>Stephen: I guess it depends on how much text is at hand.
    Sans fonts will mangle readability just as surely as a fax will mangle delicate
    forms. I think for a contemporary hi-res fax transmission Charter won&#39;t come
    out that bad. <BR> <BR>But why am I even recommending faxable fonts? The fax is
    perhaps my most despised technology. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR>Download the pdf sample to test it by yourself. <BR> <BR>And I don&#39;t see
    why two French fonts will not fit each others?
