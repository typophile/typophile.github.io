  of refresheing the layout of my papers.\r\nmy brief: simple layout reflecting the
  typography and photomanuplating skills with spot on vector specilization. The reading
  would be on web and it is acceptable to be printed in colors or black and white.
  The concept about the beauty which produced by deep study and high tech. command.\r\nI
  didn't reach the last decision on it yet.\r\nfonts, Hooge as advertising font. (

  I guess, and  I got some feedback telling me that it really clashes with everything
  else. I want to know your opinion.\r\nTrebuchet as reading font. ( I may change
  it to frutiger.)\r\nModel: Heather"
