    from the old skool: <BR> <BR>cmd-up arrow - open a widow for the parent folder
    &#40;when you have an active Finder window&#41; <BR> <BR>opt-double-click - folder
    - opens new folder window while closing the previous one <BR> <BR>opt-double-click
    - file/app - opens file/app while closing current window <BR> <BR>cmd-right arrow
    on folder in list view - open one level of disclosure arrows &#40;cmd-left arrow
    reverses&#41; <BR> <BR>cmd-opt-right arrow on folder in list view - opens full
    tree of disclosure arrows &#40;cmd-opt-left arrow reverses&#41; <BR> <BR>cmd-click

  body: I&#39;m disappointed command&#43;n isn&#39;t new folder since I used this
    so often on my old skool box. Any hack to replace or swap it with the new shift&#43;command&#43;n
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s such an unnatural key combination and cannot be done with one
    hand easily. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: Something else that has bothered me about OS X is that it&#39;s simply not
    any faster than my old Mac. <BR> <BR>Things like application launching and window
    opening/closing and redrawing are almost slower. I&#39;ve got plenty of RAM perhaps
    I need to disable something to get it to work faster. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: X is slower than 9.x on any system that&#39;ll run both. IMO, a B&amp;W 350
    with 9.x is more responsive than a 300mm PowerBook running X.

  body: 'Hmm. Your problem is not your system. &#40;FYI, I run OS  <BR>X.2.4, 644MhZ
    G4, 512MB RAM&#41;  <BR>  <BR>Next question: are you running Classic apps &#40;OS
    9 Apps&#41; or   <BR>OS X native apps? I suppose if you&#39;re a FOG user &#40;unless   <BR>you&#39;ve
    switched&#41; then you&#39;re using OS 9 for some apps and   <BR>OS X for others...  <BR>  <BR>If
    that&#39;s the case, you will see your Classic apps bog down   <BR>under OS X.
    I&#39;ll try to explain. When you launch an OS 9   <BR>application from inside
    OS X, you are launching another   <BR>operating system that runs in tandem with
    OS X. In other   <BR>words, OS X and OS 9 are both taxing your processor. Even   <BR>simple
    things like the clipboard occasionally get hung up   <BR>when switching between
    the two OSs. &#40;Sorry if I&#39;m telling   <BR>you stuff you already know.&#41;  <BR>  <BR>I
    became a happier camper when I quit using OS 9  <BR>apps altogether.'

  body: Thanks for the list - it should ease my branching out in to the Macland. I&#39;m
    used to Sun and Windows machines and recently got a Mac running X.  <BR> <BR>What
    really bothers me is editing text - HOME and END work differently there. Anyone
    know a shortcut to getting to the beginning and end of a line &#40;like when editng
    text in the &#34;Post&#34; window of this forum?  <BR> <BR>I also haven&#39;t
    found a shortcut to bring up the Image Size in Photoshop for Mac. But I haven&#39;t
    looked that hard. I have to complain to Adobe, my Photo Shop 7.0 crashes if I
    leave it idle for more than 30 minutes.

  body: Any shortcuts for by list/last modified? <BR> <BR>Happy to have same function
    when you are on columns too. A pain to have all theses folder by alphabetic order
    by default.

  body: Also, when you&#39;re editing text in most &#40;all?&#41; programs, if you
    hold down the shift key while doing any cursor moves with the keyboard, you will
    select text from wherever the cursor started.
