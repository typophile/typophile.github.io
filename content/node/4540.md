  body: I think this is Informal Gothic, the big &#34;s&#34; and &#34;e&#34; could
    have been slightly modified to the height <BR>of the R, and Revolucionario could
    come from the same typeface. <BR>The sample is from the Phil&#39;s Photo Homage
    To The Alphabet catalog. <BR>I&#39;m afraid it is not digitized. <BR> <BR><img

  body: Hmmm, I love that! If you trace that to make a font, is there any copyright
    issues with this?? Is there anywhere I can get copyright information. <BR> <BR>Cheers.
