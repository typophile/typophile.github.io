body: "I am working with ITC Garamond (currently imposed by the existing material
  and especially the logo). I first tried to find alternatives that could be a close
  match to ITC Garamond (and could work well in the field of fashion....) but from
  all what I have seen (Sabon etc), at this point I decided to stick to ITC Garamond.
  \r\n\r\nI am now exploring a secondary typeface, a modern grotesque that could work
  well with ITC Garamond but breaks a little bit with its old-style mood. I was thinking
  about Avenir or Gill. Any thoughts on this? \r\n\r\nI also need a web font that
  reflects ITC Garamond, or at least not conflict with it, but for body texts. I am
  currently trying Adobe Garamond pro but I'm not sure this is the best match. \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    Disclaimer: MyFonts webfonts are usually shitty auto-conversions of print fonts.
    \r\n\r\nDepending on the context, it might be wise to not let the logo dictate
    the rest. A quick suggestion for a more versatile alternative: [[http://www.mvbfonts.com/mvb_verdigris_pro/|MVB
    Verdigris]]. It has a relativly \u201Csilent\u201D text variant, and a display
    variant with higher contrast and taller x-height. \r\n\r\nAs for a sans serif
    companion: What roles should the different typefaces fill? Headlines, text? Serif
    and sans paired at text sizes?"

  body: "Thanks for the advice. For web fonts, I am more familiar with Typekit, which
    allows to visualize instantly the render of the font on different browsers/systems.
    Is there a difference between typekit and fonts.com in term of web conversion?\r\n\r\nFor
    the Sans serif companion, here's what I am thinking about:\r\nDisplay Titles:
    ITC Garamond \r\nSubtitles: sans-serif\r\nbody text:  ITC Garamond and I need
    an alternative for web texts. I currently use Adobe Garamond pro from Typekit.\r\n\r\nI
    will give some trials replacing ITC Garamond for another alternative, MVB Verdigris
    is effectively pretty close (I also looked at Plantin), but both are more \"font
    for book\" rather than \"Display fashion-ish fonts\", which is what I need. So
    I might maybe end up using ITC Garamond as the body text/secondary typeface and
    the sans-serif for Headlines.\r\nAny thoughts about a sans-serif?\r\nThank you!\r\n"

    on both fonts.com and Typekit don\u2019t render the same when comparing the live
    preview of both services. It is unclear to me if this has something to do with
    the service itself or with the font data they get from the foundries although
    I suspect that only the latter matters."

  body: "Interesting. Typekit has a great reputation, from what I heard.\r\n\r\nI
    also found Genath, which is beautiful and offers Display and body text options.
    It's obviously more condensed but I really like it. The font is available on http://www.webink.com.
    Webink don't offer a preview render, they only suggest a minimum size. Have you
    tried them?  \r\n\r\nI am still looking for a pretty neutral/geometrical font
    complement to use at approx 15px., and only uppercase. I found Avenir on MyFonts.com
    (I rather use Typekit or Webink) and Proxima Nova on Typekit (However I would
    prefer a font with no contrast at all...). If anyone has a good imput on this
    I'd be very grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
