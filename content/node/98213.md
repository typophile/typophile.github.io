body: "I'm trying to figure out if this is a typeface, or hand-lettered, or modified
  from a typeface. It's a book cover issued in 1990.\r\n\r\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w4KyqKJbmOU/UFWkZDaufmI/AAAAAAAAFVs/net3DsmaDhw/s1600/eszterhazy%2Badventures%2Bdavidson.jpg\r\n\r\nIt
  looks a fair bit like ITC Usherwood Bold to me.http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/usherwood/std-bold/
  but of course it has ligatures and alternates not available in the current digital
  version of that typeface. Did Usherwood ever have swash alternates? Is this a hand-lettered
  derivative, inspired by ITC Usherwood? Some other font with fancy swash alternates?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I know this face, but can't place it. I'm not at my studio this week, so I
    can't look it up in my specimen books. I'll be back next weekend and look it up
    if no one has identified it by then.

    up. Sorry. \r\n\r\nI could swear I've seen it somewhere before. Seems likely it
    was a late film-font-era face, maybe late seventies or early eighties."

  body: "The base font -without swashes- looks like <strong>[[http://www.linotype.com/157112/Pasquale-family.html|Pasquale]]</strong>
    by Tony Stan\r\n(Agfa-Monotype, 1990)\r\n\r\nPS: Judging from the publication
    date (no OT fonts in 1990) and the \"Th\" ligature, it could probably be a custom
    job based on Pasquale\r\n"

    it.
