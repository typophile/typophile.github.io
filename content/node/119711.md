  Indian Script is the closest thing I've turned up so far.\r\nhttp://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/indianscript2.php\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nF"

    Not a match to your samples:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/saloonkeeper/\r\n\r\nCould
    it be custom by this business?:\r\nhttp://victorianwoodshop.com/vintage4.html"

  body: That site is where I found the font. Haven't located it anywhere else. Might
    be unique to the woodworking  / sign making industry somehow.

    the no spur variation seen in Hanson above.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Clasico_5327.jpg]\r\n\r\nhttp://uniquesarasota.com/unique/clasico-cafe-bar/"

  body: "Appleton does have the median spurs, but I'm seeing a different lowercase
    o and s.\r\n\r\nClasico does appear to be the same typeface as the original sample.
    The logo was designed by Max Kelly, who seems to use the font a great deal:\r\n\r\nhttp://maxkellydesign.tumblr.com/\r\nhttp://maxkelly.com/\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    you can contact him and ask what the typeface is...."

  body: "Feldspar, no need--Ryuk has correctly identified this as Packard Script,
    by Letterhead Fonts (see above).\r\n\r\nWell, Mr. Kelly is certainly getting his
    $199 out of the font (and shame on the sign company for claiming it as proprietary
    and not identifying it properly)."

    car nameplate into a script family. Of course the car never needed spurs. That

    to be a deal to get 3 more fonts for $199."
