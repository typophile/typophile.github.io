body: This font is my first foray into type design in quite a while; due to work,
  I haven&#39;t had the chance to do much in Fontographer, but recently I decided
  to dust off some old ideas and see where I could take them. <BR> <BR>Theoria &#91;working
  title&#93; is a bitmap face that I have been developing for use at 8px. It is my
  take on economic use of pixels, combining the use of gaps in bitmap shapes to add
  to the clarity with 1px ascenders.  <BR> <BR>And yes, in case you are wondering,
  i am quite mad. 1px. <BR> <BR>Feedback, comments, anything&#39;s welcome.  <BR>

    interesting feature for the font. International characters were going to be quite
    the pain in this case, but playing with optical tricks resulted in the following
    &#91;preliminary&#93; international latin characters: <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1469.gif"

    great. Good take on international characters, but it gets a tad illegible at times.
    <BR>It has got a very pleasing texture, I like that. '

  body: ' &#62; use of gaps in bitmap shapes to add to the clarity <BR> <BR>Masterful
    ingenuity. <BR>Most people realize that whitespace is more valuable than it seems,
    but very very few people manage to actually use it to such great practical effect.
    <BR> <BR>And the application with the accents is &#42;so&#42; nice that I would
    recommend making a &#34;progressive&#34; outline font to go with it. Don&#39;t
    be surprised if it becomes a big hit with display designers; it can even be seen
    as giving a new cultural validity to accented writing systems. And do it fast
    - this is an idea that &#42;will&#42; be stolen, very quickly - I can feel it.

  body: ' I reworked some of the characters, finalized the base character sets and
    drew the additional international latin chars today.. I thought having only 1px
    to &#39;cheat&#39; with &#91;above the top of the ascenders&#93; was a problem,
    so imagine the fun i had from drawing accents on caps. <BR> <BR>all in all the
    set looks pretty useful, but I&#39;m looking for texts that&#39;ll let me sample
    the various international chars. <BR> <BR>So, like pangrams, but more international-oriented.
    <BR> <BR>Anyone? '

    link to a new thread in a non-bitmap face section of the forums down the line.
