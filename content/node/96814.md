  body: "close similar: <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/sterling-script/|Sterling
    Script]]</strong> (Canada Type, 2005)\r\n\r\nthere is also <strong>OPTI AltoGreeting
    Script</strong> Castcraft Software, Inc. (1990-1991) which seems closer to your
    sample, but Sterling Script is probably of better quality\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI
    found them using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com\r\n"

    to Mike Yanega, you can see a showing of one of the digital versions (Altast Greeting)
    <a href='http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg1.html' target='_blank'>here</a>
    and the names of various digital versions <a href='http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/ScriptListAB.html'

    long gone. Web search is your friend ..."

  body: "Hi Mike, thanks for your help. I am not sure I understand correctly, does
    this mean that this typeface is not digital?\r\nSince I found this on the intimissimi.com
    website, I tend to consider this a little awkward, mostly considering how the
    company makes use of typeface both in print and web communication.\r\nMeaning,
    why use a-not-available-in-digital-format typeface?\r\nBut maybe I did not get
    it right.\r\n:-)\r\n"

  body: YES, this is it. Although the meaning of the discourse is still confused to
    me...:-) Thank you!

  body: "I think what Mike F was trying to say, if I may try to rephrase it, is that
    many fonts we have are digital re-creations (revivals) of old pre-digital typefaces.
    \"Altast Greeting\" is such a re-creation, and was re-named to avoid possible
    copyright issues with the typeface name.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
