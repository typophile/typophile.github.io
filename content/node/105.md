    you. but that adobe face is to much, extremely fancy and the ANAL customer told
    me first off that he didn&#39;t want any thing that fancy, he wants a script,
    but with a plain feel. ?????? basicly i told him he would have to find a style
    he like himself. he keeps knocking every thing i show him so i told him to go
    else where. thanks everyond including Steve C! =&#41; '
