  web content? I would like to improve the readablility of the content in the sites
  my company designs while at the same time keeping the content searchable. I know
  that Emigre was one of the first foundries to create bitmap fonts for screen use
  but are there newer designs/foundries that you could reccomend? \r\nI like the text
  font that is used in the Typophile forums. \r\n\r\nThank you."
