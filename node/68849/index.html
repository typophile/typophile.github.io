<p>I sent it to FontLab for a checkup. Pretty soon I got a reply from them, and they could not point to individual character, but I got a replay:&quot;…the problem is in the CFF compression. This is a AFDKO issue I think. If you turn off the &ldquo;Use subroutines to compress outlines&hellip;&rdquo; option in FLS before you export FontBook will accept the font.&quot;</p>
<p>This was all new to me, and since I make commercial typefaces, I need to make sure they work. I got help from this forum about installing the font without FontBook, but the font; the end product, is supposed to work everywhere, so I was somewhat relieved that FontLab advise cleared the issue.</p>
<p>But what are these CFF compression and AFDKO? And should I know more about them?</p>

In most cases it is a violation of licenses, but I for my part don’t contact foundries in cases, in which I am able to tune or correct fonts, remapping of characters for example. Well, if I can avoid it, I don’t use FontLab for those corrections, but many people use it. And there may be cases, in which you want to open your own OTF in FontLab. Except from that I think, there was a problem with the AFDKO (the autohint program), if the outlines are compressed.</div>

<p>Until you start getting into web fonts which need to get downloaded for every visitor, and whose file size directly relates to the page load time.</p>
<p>Of course, using Gzip on the font files on the server may provide similar or sufficient compression benefits. It would be interesting to compare CFF compression rates. But not everyone has complete control over their server-side compression, so providing a more compact font is probably a Good Thing, if those fonts might be used directly as web fonts.</p>

<p>As you can see there is a big difference, if you don’t convert the fonts to woff or gzip them (bigger than I thought), but almost none, if you convert or gzip them.</p>
<p>The only difference between the two versions is the activated subroutine compression. In other words, although the original fonts are probably compressed, I had generated them again for a fair comparison. Woff even slightly has beaten Gzip. (Gzip version 1.3, compression rate &ldquo;fast&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Except from that the css file (fonts integrated as Base64) or the font files have to be downloaded one time only and then they are in the Browser cache, right? And normally you are not using more than five fonts, which additionally are less complex than Minion. And not to forget the increasing download speeds and storage.</p>

<p>With regard to the hinting I only saw the FontLab bug, when it decompiles fonts. More to the point, I saw a problem with hint substitution and counter hints (vstem3/hstem3) in the small letter m, as far as I remember. Formerly I first generated fonts with FontLab, then I used the autohint program, that belongs to the AFDKO and in the end I tried to correct a few things in FontLab. And FontLab did damage the hinting on opening the fonts (but not on generating them). (Meanwhile I use the AFDKO autohinting program directly in FontLab.) The hints are likewise in the cff table and the subroutine compression applies also to the hints.</p>
<p>And with regard to the server I don’t understand, what you mean. Converting fonts to the woff format is a question of seconds. In the woff format even digitally signatures survive. The subroutine compression changes fonts, woff or gzip don’t. And the server does not make a difference between woff and otf. By the way, I may be wrong, but does the server really unpacks gzipped files? Or does the browser unpack them? If the server unpacks them, where is the advantage of gzipped files, except from sparing storage on the server? Well, I should google for the answer.</p>
<p>Thomas, I am burning to see Adobe’s new PS hinting tutorial. Do you know, if it is already finished?</p>

<p>My comments about &ldquo;not everyone controls their own server&rdquo; refers to Gzip, not WOFF. The server doesn&rsquo;t unpack them, but it has to know about which files are Gzipped.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t in any way objecting to using WOFF, just pointing out that there is a significant chunk of web font delivery out there that is neither WOFF nor EOT, and a noticeable chunk of users can&rsquo;t easily use Gzipped fonts (or don&rsquo;t know how to change their server configuration), meaning that there is still an advantage to natively compressed fonts.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m missing the boat on is, nobody who is sane wants to serve OpenType CFF fonts as web fonts now anyway, as their rendering in Windows browsers sucks. The browsers-of-the-future that render them well will probably all have built-in WOFF support, so my point is doubtless moot.</p>
<p>I still like smaller font files &ldquo;just in principle,&rdquo; though.  :)</p>

<p>As do I. But on the web, it&rsquo;s more than principle, it&rsquo;s page load time. At least the &ldquo;first view&rdquo;, before the font is, hopefully, cached locally.
Plus, I&rsquo;m just an &ldquo;optimization&rdquo; nut.</p>

<p>gzipped files are decompressed at the browser level.</p>
<p>google or bing: &ldquo;steve souder gzip&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll find more info than you really want to know.</p>

<p>I just found this information: “Every day, more than 99 human years are wasted because of uncompressed content.”</p>
<p>Obviously they never have heard about Zen. Be instead of waiting for the content! Funny, especially if you know, that every second the human population grows by 150 pollution units. On the other side, compressed files may spare energy. Mother Earth (and the leopards. Edit: Hunting leopoards) will be grateful for every uncompressed or compressed file.</p>
<p>Oh, I just see, that in English a chetah is a hunting leopard. Now I wonder, whether the other leopards release energy with the help of cold fusion.</p>

<p>Yes, page load time is a big deal. But the subroutinization thing only works for OpenType CFF (not TrueType), and nobody who knows what they&rsquo;re doing is going to use OpenType CFF at all today, because of the rendering issues in current Windows browsers.</p>
<p>Now, that being said, there is also a less-general TrueType concept, the composite glyph, which uses other things as components. Not as strong a general function, but it is handy for accented characters, and makes uncompressed TTFs noticeably smaller than they might otherwise be.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>T</p>
