At the moment we design, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->print (digital xerox and riso), vinyl <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and photographic signage, large <!-- raw HTML omitted -->format quality art reproductions. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We want to keep it simple and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->apply the branding to business <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cards to outdoor signage. I have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->chosen Thesis Sans as the main <!-- raw HTML omitted -->typeface as it appears to work very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->well from large to small. I am thinking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of a pallette of yellow+black, a homage <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to nz's road signs and blatant visiblity. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the moment the building is a purple <!-- raw HTML omitted -->colour and promoted as &quot;the purple <!-- raw HTML omitted -->place&quot;. I think it is quite tired (15 years) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and dated, as the road signage is pretty <!-- raw HTML omitted -->much invisible from a distance and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a new building next door blocks the view <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of our premises from the road. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bottom image shows our current <!-- raw HTML omitted -->street sign from 50m down the road. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am trying to get the name spelt  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'correctly' - signs &amp; graphics instead <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of signz n' graphix, which is a pain <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to spell and looks amateurish. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kris &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What you've done already is a huge improvement on what can only be described as ghastly. I like the yellow / black combo, and as much as that purple makes me heave, it would sit as well as anything with it. I love the elegance of logo one, and the second version tickles me. I would also agree that it simply HAS to be spelt right. I'm curious as to what kind of client you receive. The few suggestions you've already mocked up suggest a marked jump in 'quality' of client.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kris, your intensions might be right but if the business is registered as siznz and graphix it might cost your company some nz bucks to get it changed even if you can. Someone else might have the name signs and graphics and thats why they used that name in the first place.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> As for your graphics The colors are good and I like the pencil with wings, but could you investigate another yellow? Why be exactly like a road sign. Also doesn't yellow fade when exposed to sunlight over time?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Looks like a real challenge you have ahead of you Kris. Currently, I would be embarrassed to drive into this parking lot. I might even where sunglasses and a trenchcoat before getting out of my car and walking in. But it seems like you could really transform this companies identity into something spectacular. Looks like fun! You could approach it in many ways. There is something strangley interesting and friendly about the shape of the building. It could be really cool to incoorporate an icon of the building with Logo #1 Almost like rest stop signage. It's a not so special building that could be made to feel really important and sophisticated. Anyway, just a thought, GOOD LUCK!</div>
