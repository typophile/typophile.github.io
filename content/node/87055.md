body: "hello \r\ni'm working on creating a mark/logo type for an environmentally conscience
  t-shirt company in the Northwest. Their focus is simple - create/design environmentally
  sound (recyclable) tshirts that deliver a 'green, recyclable' message via screen
  prints of graphics/messaging/color/textures. my proposed mark will hopefully convey
  the idea of never ending, continuous and recycle. \r\n\r\nafter doing research i
  found that the recycle three triangle arrows have been done to death and not where
  i want to go. my solution is a 'regenerating' ambigram of an R. the company name
  is ReUse. please check out the mark and let me know what you think. i have one big
  concern on it's representation and hopefully it's something i'm over thinking. your
  critique is greatly appreciated. ps. can an ambigram be just on letter?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ReUse_4929.jpg]"

    tecnique.\r\nI like it overall and think it has potential. Have you tried to use
    more round curves?"

  body: "To me it looks more like \"121\".\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm not a big fan of
    ambigrams as logos, as you often end up with a design that's hard to read or odd-looking,
    all for the sake of a visual trick which most users won't notice or care about.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not saying it's never a good idea. If you think it's appropriate in your situation,
    go for it; maybe you can make it work. But remember that your main goal should
    be to clearly symbolize the company via the logo in a way that's clear to users."

    think the concept could work, but the 121 issue and the execution need a bit of

  body: thanks everyone. all valid points. my one big concern was not mentioned by
    one of you, so that makes me feel better. that concern was/is that it reminds
    of me of a swastika. don't know why, but i can't shake it. thoughts on that?

    so early on in the project.\r\nIt's long standing within many industries will
    go far when identifying the sustainable and socially responsible nature of the
    business to it's potential clients.\r\nI worked on a similar project for an eco
    events company a few years ago and found that the inclusion of the symbol massively
    reinforced the company's point of view.\r\nI'm not saying it should be the focus
    of the mark but a gentle nod in its direction will help the project along.\r\n\r\nI
    like the idea of your current mark but it lacks that crucial cyclical quality.
    To me it simply states an A to B scenario (start and finish) rather than a reccuring
    process.\r\nTry adding a third dimension to the piece and sitting it on a prism/triangle
    to make the visual link between the end of the last 'U' and the beginning of the
    first 'R'."

  body: How about a gradiated colour change to green from the bottom horizontal bar,
    then on the termination top right build in a leaf shape (with subtle veins etc).
    this will isolate the R shape, and the recycle idea, giving purpose to the final
    icon on both fronts, 1. ownership for the client 2. ethos and purpose of the company
    business.
