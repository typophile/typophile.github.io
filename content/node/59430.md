    LOVE the numbers in [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface|Neutraface Sans]].
    Really nice OpenType font set, with alternate numbers and ordinals, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Great suggestion, but it's not quite the vibe I'm going for. If I were to
    choose something from House, Chalet would be more what I'm looking for.
