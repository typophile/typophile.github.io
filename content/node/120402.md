  body: "Excellent find Leigh. Love the font. A Trajan for the 21st century.\r\nConfusing
    website. Can't figure out if this was a bespoke font for client  Jon Rafman or
    simply a font by David Rudchick. There is no information that I can see on how
    Petrus might be purchased or otherwise acquired.\r\nDon"
