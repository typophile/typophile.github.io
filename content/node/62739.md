  also interesting to think about and I wanted to see what response the typographic
  community may have to it. \r\n\r\nDo you guys think that this century will see the
  invention of a completely new classification of type? That is to say a mainstream
  type class that is not Serif or Sans or Script, something truly new that could not
  be classified as anything seen before in type? Or do you think that typography has
  branched out as far as it will and will not see anything entirely unseen before?
  \r\n\r\nIt is interesting for me to think about because I cannot fathom a way that
  type could be drastically different without becoming a new alphabet and yet it is
  difficult for me to believe that it could not be done. \r\n\r\nPerhaps this will
  pose an interesting question for some of you, maybe it has been asked before or
  it could be just the simplistic pondering of an ignorant student. Either way I would
  love to hear some responses. :) "

  body: "Yes thank you that is quite similar. However Many of the ideas there do not
    exactly fit with my question. I guess my question has more to do with the possibility
    of having something completely remote from anything before. \r\n\r\nPerhaps it
    is just my naivety as a young designer but I find the thought of something completely
    new and completely different quite exciting. Yet on the other hand it seems quite
    daunting to imagine something so far removed from everything that has evolved
    into the various type classifications we have today. On one hand It seems that
    everything we have can be traced back in history to various points of origin and
    it is difficult to imagine the creation of type without drawing from the past.
    On the other hand however I cant help looking at artists like Jackson Pollock
    and wondering if I will see a time when typography takes such a turn. This does
    not necessarily mean that I think it may take an abstract turn, just a turn in
    a completely new direction that no one has addressed yet.      "

  body: "Naming and classification of type has long been practiced in sort of an after-the-fact
    way. First, someone creates a variation on the norm which is different enough
    to be noticed. In the conversations that follow among type afficionados, a new
    name comes about as a way to mark the new breed. Afterwards, there are variations
    on that form and then discussions evolve to decide if these variations belong
    to that genre or not.  You can find numerous threads here online with posters
    arguing nuances of definition. As long as there are people with a keen enough
    interest to care about the flavors of type, there will be new names and new arguments
    to define or reject a definition of a type classification. Enjoy the rhetoric;
    peruse the analytic dialogue; nitpick your exacting set of stipulations but fear
    not, there will be more to come:-) \r\nYes, there will be something beyond \"neohumanist
    sans\".\r\n\r\n ChrisL"

  body: "Michael, I know there are always new typefaces and new styles of type all
    the time and there is definitely nothing wrong with that. I guess what I am wondering
    about is the possibility of a new classification of type. \r\n\r\nI guess I imagine
    the evolution of type as something like the evolution of animals. With different
    branches, each resulting from variations of earlier branches of type with each
    branch continuing to evolve into various subcategories and so on. So with all
    of typography being the all encompassing top of the chain and the various writing
    systems below that. So i have begun to wonder if it is possible within our writing
    system to create a new classification without it evolving from something else.
    If we might see the creation of a new kingdom in the taxonomy of type so to speak.
    \r\n\r\nThough I admit this idea might be a bit far out there I find it an interesting
    train of thought. "

  body: "Cody,\r\nAs my young friend Michael says, I am an old fart. I still like
    to see the envelope pushed and hope you will keep trying yourself.\r\nPersonally,
    I ignore classifications other than just having some fun with my friends who love
    that sort of thing. I just design type without trying to make it either fit or
    not fit a classification. I feel more comfortable approaching form as naively
    as possible and solving structural problems that come about. I do have a great
    deal of interest in how the finished product is meant to function so categories
    like text, display, and signage do mean a lot to me.\r\nMy only advice to you
    is to allow your typeface to be what it is and not just try to will it to be different.
    It may or may not be seen as groundbreaking by others but you have no control
    over that anyway. Just make type and let the categories fall where they may.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    movement, where type was made to emulate old, worn-out metal or wood type. That
    didn't seem as broad as you suggest ... something that is neither sans or serif,
    but something else entirely. \r\n\r\nLike others, I would be interested to see
    something else, but until someone actually develops it, no one will be able to
    predict it."
