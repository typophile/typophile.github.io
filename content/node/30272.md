  body: "Looks pretty good to me so far, but I'm sure others with more authority in
    inspecting the curves will have more to say about  that than I.\r\n\r\nThe internal
    up-hooks in the h, k, m, and n are pretty distracting to me, as they interrupt
    the flow of what one expects to see as a single stroke. Likewise with the top
    loops on b, d, h, k, and l, though it seems more of a stylistic decision than
    the afforementioned up-hooks. At least by the way I learned cursive, the connecting
    stroke from the b should come from the top, similar to the o and v, so this one
    looks a bit off to me.\r\n\r\nAre your connecting strokes attached before or after
    the letters?  "

  body: "Looks nice, the general shapes and style of the script.\r\n\r\nI think you
    might let the bottom of the g connect to the next character just like it does
    with the j. I agree with Jason Pagura that the connection of the b should be on
    top.\r\nThe s is a bit too thin."

  body: the x is a little off, as well as your noted o, r, & s. perhaps it's just
    too harsh in contrast to the rest of your strokes.

  body: "Heres an updated pic, theres still a lot of issues to work out.  I initially
    wanted them all to connect, but I don't think that will work.  Does the \"br\"
    of \"brown\" look ok withought being connected? Does the \"s\" work or would a
    loop in it (blue) look better\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scriptee_3573.png]"

    although they both work. (alternate?)"

  body: The lowercase feels pretty solid now, I'm now beginning uppercase. I'm still
    debating those uphooks on the "m" and "h" type letters, anything else seem in
    need ot tweaking?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/script3_6305.png]

  body: The l could be more open, like the top loop of your f, but that's just my
    opinion. It works the way you have it.

  body: "I think the 'h', 'k', 'm', and 'n' don't need the little hooks on their first
    strokes. Rounding them (like the top of 'u') might look better.\r\n\r\nIf you're
    really worried about the 'b' not connecting, you could try making it look like
    your 'v' with an ascender.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a really fun and tasty script.
    I like the direction you're taking with the caps 'A' as well.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "<cite>\"... you could try making it look like your 'v' with an ascender\"\r\n\r\nThat
    is actually a good point I think. That would make the b look better imo."

  body: "Hey chillypepper!\r\n\r\nGood work! \r\n\r\nThers's go my humble opinion:\r\n\r\nI
    believe that there are some forms that do not get along between them, if one watches
    the system as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe stroke modulations and its relation with a pen
    are strange in \"A\". \r\nThere are thickenings and refinings where it must not
    have them (c,g,z,x, etc). Counterforms are unbalanced in some letters (f,z). \r\n\r\nThe
    final strokes (that small hook) of (h,k,m,n) I would make them subtler. \r\n\r\nAnd
    finally, it seems to me that the \"x\" and \"z\" deserves a redesign. \"z\" looks
    like it has a big head and \"x\" seems not to be part of this group.\r\n\r\nSorry
    about my english, hope I has been clear...\r\n\r\nBest regards!"
