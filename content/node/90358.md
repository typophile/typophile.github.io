  culturally related in a proud fashion.\r\n\r\nWhich typeface does it use (the bigger
  type)? WhatTheFont says Skirt Bold, but there has to be a more common alternative
  to it than a Ray Larabie font...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

  body: Why, atwe? My statement indicates that Mr Larabie is NOT a common font, but
    a fancy font used generally by people with well developed tastes for typefaces.
    It also indicates that there should be a similar and more popular alternative
    to it, because I doubt that the people creating these images have access to quality
    fonts such as Skirt Bold...
