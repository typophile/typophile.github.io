    Gothic Next</a> and the page I linked to provides a little information about it.\r\n\r\nIIRC
    there\u2019s not a great deal about Trade Gothic out there simply because it\u2019s
    not a typeface with a really remarkable design or story. I think it would be more
    interesting to interview Mike Parker at Font Bureau (who worked with, for, and
    succeeded Burke) and Akira Kobayashi (who did TG Next) and make a poster out of
    that.\r\n\r\nAnd stay away from the idiotic Wikipedia entry that begins \u201CTrade
    Gothic is a typeface which mostly follows the Bitstream version of News Gothic\u2026\u201D"

  body: "Saratyp, apologies for my earlier post! Google didn't really work for me
    either!\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you are required to make the poster for college?\r\n\r\nI
    think if the poster is to be about the typeface itself, then you can look to the
    typeface itself for the content of your poster. Observe the qualities of the typeface,
    x-height, compression etc. These graphic qualities might make for a better poster
    than the history of the typeface as they will work at a distance. Perhaps you
    could combine these with some of the sources James mentioned for some close up
    reading."

    is a page about an in-progress work on a Mike Parker biography where I found a
    passage on Trade Gothic if any one coming to this thread is interested:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Jackson
    had guarded one small corner of capacity and used it to produce our one large
    series for trade typesetters.  Trade Gothic is a sans serif in four widths, three
    weights, and ten sizes, a refined and expanded linecaster version of Morris Fenton
    Benton's great 1908/9 series Lightline and News Gothic.  Jackson and the company
    saw it as an 'American' answer to the 'European' sans serifs, headed by Univers.</blockquote>"
