    been from the game rush2049 but I don't think so. It was released on the N64 and
    the dreamcast but both packages where the same.\r\n\r\nI can't contact the site
    that make the logo. I'm sure the text was stroked with the blending options in
    photoshop.\r\n\r\nI've found fonts that are kinda close but not that close. most
    of the simular fonts don't have a strikthrough zero or the nine is wrong, but
    most don't have the same kind of two."

    I see while I tried to make the font in paint is, this is not a font it was made
    up.\r\n\r\nI'll make it with fontstruct or paint which ever one is better."

  body: I only can think of making more numbers. It will take time to make the letters.
    Also I find the angles hard to control in fontstruct. Could I use one or Adobe's
    products instead?
