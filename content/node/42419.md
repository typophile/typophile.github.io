  body: You really do need to have a specific goal to get best access to the Cary
    Collection. It is not a browsing library. Unless you come with a rather specific
    thing you would like to see or research, you may not find the experience all that
    beneficial. Also send your request in advance so it can be waiting for you when
    you arrive. The contents of that library are amazing.
