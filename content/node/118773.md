  de Gruyter, Jan 1, 2009\r\nAFAIK there is no publicly available digitization under
  the name Alphabet EDF-GDF.\r\nI seem recall that there are some similar digital
  fonts, which probably give no credit to M. Frutiger, perhaps buried in a techo or
  sci-fi catergory.\r\nAny suggestions?\r\nThanks.\r\nDon\r\n"

    be on sticking point.

    to have many similar characteristics as your sample albeit being too tall.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abcd1_5987.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/abcd2_6346.jpg]

  body: "EDITED:\r\nBob, as for the pointy _A_, I feel that if it was appropriate
    for Adrian Frutiger to use in a lettering design for Electricite de France --
    a rather big corporation with a presumably conservative ethos -- it's probably
    right for the design. I note that the somewhat similar squarish sans, Bank Gothic,
    has a pointy _A_.\r\nAlphabet EDF-GDF has innovations -- unless someone knows
    of an earlier design with them -- that include the unusual notchless transition
    from the vertical stroke to the top stroke on _n_, _m_ and _r_, and similar notch
    free treatment of other letters such as _b_, _d_, _g_, _h_, _p_, _q_, and _u_.\r\nThe
    search continues.\r\nDon"
