  barcodes? There might be regulations on this but I cannot seem to find any when
  I \"googled\" it. I am working on a DVD package and I would like to scale down the
  barcode (aka the UPC code) to fit better into the layout. I've often wondered this
  but have never asked.\r\n\r\n(this is the small box that has black lines, white
  bkgd, used for retail purposes)\r\n\r\nI am under a tight deadline and won't be
  able to ask my client until tomorrow afternoon. And it would surely help to know
  tonight. Thanks!"

  body: "I have seen on many packages the proportions of the UPC code rectangle changed.
    The height and scale of the bars does not seem to be relevant to a a proper read.
    Just don't squoosh the numbers and it should turn out fine.\r\n\r\nStill, I would
    hope someone with more expertise can confirm or deny this."

  body: "Book jacket designers generally regard bar codes as pieces of ugly that just
    have to be dealt with. Reducing bar codes can be done without compromising the
    ability of scanners to read the bars.\r\n\r\nAt our publishing house we run the
    bar code so the height of the tallest bars -- those at the extreme left of the
    ISBN bar code -- is about 3/8\".\r\n\r\nWe do not compress the width of the bar
    code. That's because compressing the width of the overall bar code will compress
    the width of individual bars. This can cause difficulties with scanning devices.
    You do not want that. \r\n\r\nWe began this re-sizing 9+ years ago, when I came
    here as design manager. I'm guessing that we have put nearly 800,000 individual
    books on the market since then [that's copies, not titles]. We have had not a
    single complaint that our bar codes were not readable. \r\n\r\nThere are other
    ways to lessen the visual impact of bar codes without making them un-scannable.
    We often put them in picture boxes with rounded corners, and fill those boxes
    with a tint value appropriate to the overall design. This softens them a bit.
    You have to be careful that the background is not too dark. I use BarCode Pro
    to make bar codes, and this software allows you to scale as you make the bar code.
    So they come into Quark & InDesign at the right size.\r\n\r\nThe best treatment
    I ever saw of a bar code was on the back of a book about swamps and wetlands.
    The designer obtained a line drawing of reeds and then stuck the bar code amongst
    the reeds. It was nearly invisible. This was fine aesthetically, but I do bet
    it played hob with store clerks trying to figure where to aim the scanner.\r\n\r\nI
    hope this is some help. It is late at night that I have seen this, so I may be
    too late. Good luck. Post here with the results, please.\r\n\r\nWhat do poetic
    dogs do? They bark odes. Good night.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "There are specifications regarding minimum and maximum sizes for barcodes.
    These are governed by the UCC (Uniform Code Council) which manages the UPC, EAN,
    and other barcode systems (at least here in the U.S.)\r\n\r\nI don't remember
    what the specs are off the top of my head, but I believe the maximum reduction
    was 80% (but that's from the original standard, which may or may not be what you
    have to start with depending upon where you got your barcode from or what software
    setting you use to generate it).\r\n\r\nThere are specifications regarding the
    vertical truncating of barcodes as well. Truncating is definitely more robust
    than scaling. The 3/8 inch spec that Will mentions seems to me right about the
    limit.\r\n\r\nToleration for variance may differ by the intended outlet or market.
    I think general retail outlets may be less tolerant of adjustments to UPCs than
    book stores may be to EANs, for instance.\r\n\r\ni have had similar experiences
    to Will's (since we've probably tackled similar challenges and situations).\r\n\r\nThe
    publisher I used to work for required both EAN and UPC on back covers (many books
    were destined for multiple outlets), so it was a nuisance to say the least. We
    also had to place the EAN and UPC in different locations so that there was no
    possibility of cross-scanning (though I always suspected that tales of this were
    apocryphal). I often turned the UPC 90\xB0 in order to save space where I had
    to run a headline. Last I knew, there were movements afoot to revise the EAN with
    ISBN-13 numbers to make the UPC redundant in the book industry. But I haven't
    kept up with that development.\r\n\r\nIf you place a tint behind the barcode,
    make sure the color build has no more than about 10% K (better if there is none.)
    Once again, there are specs about the minimum percentage contrast between bars
    and background, but I don't remember the numbers.\r\n\r\nSome book manufacturers
    have the ability to test-scan a code on a proof before production. I would bet
    this is true in the DVD industry as well.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "When I wrote last night, I was writing from home, and I could not recall
    the % of height reduction. Like Kent, I was thinking that 80% is correct. Now,
    back at work, I have looked at my BarCode Pro settings. & truth to tell, I do
    not see where the setting for the overall proportioning is. I know that when I
    started using Barcode Pro, I fiddled quite a while before I got a barcode to be
    the size I could tolerate, and that was scannable. Then when we went to OSX and
    I had to get the upgrade I had to start that jiggering all over again.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the tints: within BarCode Pro there is a function that allows you to test
    the combination of barcode color [100% K] against the tint you wish to fill the
    box. It will warn you if the tint is too dark for scanning.\r\n\r\nI have always
    been happy with BarCode Pro, and have not ordered barcodes from vendors. I suppose
    that organizations which use many barcodes might profit by having them all generated
    at once by a vendor. For our small operation I generate no more than 30 barcodes
    a year, and BarCode Pro is swell. I can make a new one in moments.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "I'm usually told it can go down to 80%. Also that it can have a background
    tint as long as it's composed of only yellow and magenta, I was always told no
    cyan or K in the background. \r\n\r\nBarcodes to me are the visual equivalent
    of that awful noise the computer made when it logged on to a dial-up modem. Luckily
    with WiFi and broadband that noise is largely in the past."

  body: I regularly have barcodes scaled to 80%, but I get the supplier to do that,
    rather than scaling it in the layout program, so that the line width reduction
    (to account for ink spread on press) is correct.

    my client so it could already be reduced. which means i WILL need to check with
    the supplier before messing with the size. thx jupiterboy for the link.
