  body: "HTF Didot will get you close but it lacks those swoopy serifs on the C and
    S. \r\n\r\nSome interesting manipulation here, such as the chopped off serif on
    the V in AVEDON for kerning purposes. And likewise the A in TRUMAN. Actually the
    A has been messed around with a lot. This lends evidence to my sense that this
    was done by hand, back in the day.\r\n\r\nActually Bauer Bodoni may be even closer
    but it has ink traps in the A for example, that this lacks."

    then I agree <em>H&FJ</em> Didot is the closest you can get."
