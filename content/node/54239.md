  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bauhaus_4810.JPG]\r\nLooks like Bauhaus,
    but with the lowercase <strong>m</strong> modified to cap size, and the horizontal
    stroke on the <strong>L</strong> extended."

  body: actually looked at that one too, but unfortunately it's not it either unless
    they modified it quite a bit, L is extended, and like you said M is lower to make
    upper, but G is a bit off too horizontally and not as geometric as Bauhaus.
