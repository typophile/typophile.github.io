body: Can anybody help me find a shop that supplies type gauges in the UK? Preferably
  one with online ordering. I&#39;ve exhausted every search I can think of in Google
  and can&#39;t find a source anywhere. The best I could find was a PDF but it only
  has Pica measurements and I sure could do with something that has Points as well.

    able to pass on contact deatails for their supplier if they still have one.  <BR>

    <BR>On page 102 of their catalogue they have a selection of depth gauges and typescales,
    it is unavailable at the moment, but give them a call. <BR>Tim
