<div class=commentbody>Yes, it looks like Dolly, which is not surprising as it was designed by the folks who designed Dolly. As to how good it is, that must be judged in the context of the product it labels, and it's not a logo for MTV. It is sober, with reminders of a long history, but with a contemporary air. All that it does admirably well. Its only shortcoming in my eyes is that it could be more elegant, given the look of the cars. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the one thing that stands out to me is how incredibly balanced it is. The M is squash in the middle, but it doesn't feel forced, even though in other fonts it would be slightly to the left. YOu can see in the background of pictures they played with the idea of a stronger M, but in this case it's subtle, like a grounding force, sturdy. Not a bad image to give off.

<div class=commentbody>Frankly, although the lettering is quite lovely, I find it to be a non-identifier. I don't see it as distinctive enough to act as a logo. It just looks like a word set in a traditional looking typeface. The typeface does not seem to suit the company, either. It may make a lovely titling face for a book but I can't imagine it cast in metal and chrome on a car. If this is a logo, it should be more evocative of the company and the products instead of just blending into the world of book typography.

<div class=commentbody>Chris, William, it's not a logo for a car. Daimler AG (uses Corporate S typeface) is actually parent company that incorporates Mercedes-Benz (uses Corporate A), Daimler Trucks, but also Daimler Financial Services (formerly DaimlerChrysler bank, using Corporate E). Anyway, as Chris pointed out, it is undistinctive, IMHO does not work that well with former elements of identity, and for the money...well, quite poor. DaimlerChrysler identity including logo, Corporate typeface trilogy and design principles was really great and very sophisticated. This one is not. Maybe balanced, sober or whatsoever, but neither beautiful & balanced, nor beautifully sober, nor outstanding or memorable.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chris, you've got a good point about its not being distinctive. However, they do have the famous three spoked wheel for Mercedes-Benz. Lorem points out that this is for more than the cars, so, yes, that is a telling criticism. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I actually find it rather distinctive, but I guess I spend a lot of time looking at book typefaces. That very narrow "L" combined with the splayed "M" and the extended lef of the "R" give it unusual proportions, but in a way that works for me.

Maybe we could add rounded (not sharp) serifs that give it a book look.
The fact is, Daimler is not luxury only.
Although they have Maybach,

they also make trucks and these mini-vehicles:

Thinking about this more, my unease about it is that the way in which it is distinctive is that it is a bit playful. If it were for a toy company, it would be fine. I just don't think it suits the brand. I predict that it will be changed within a few years. </div>

Only at the baseline, to my eyes. If you look at the whole (holes?!), it's spaced pretty well. It's unquestionably a difficult set of caps to kern!

<div class=commentbody>The overly expressive leg of the R contrasts with the other more formal elements of the letter. It looks like someone just took a swash and stuck it under a P.
So, in my head (which is never a safe place) when reading the word I have to go back over the last two letters, and DAIMLER becomes DAIMLEP-ER.
If the intent of the wordmark was impart something along the lines of solid-structured-stylish, I think the R's contrasting elements undermine the solid-structured part... and unbalance the wordmark.

Didn't they get a proper briefing or why is the workmark so ponderous, so "vin ordinaire", "so … not classy". Maybe i'm totally wrong and Daimler will develop and sell new products, far from being a motorvehicle, with a new philosophy …
You're folks getting deep with the typedesign, but i cannot, the wordmark just allows me to look at the overall appearance …
PS
The wordmark bites Corporate S on the signboard. Hehe, and it works really good together with the moustache of the CEO, damn right.
