body: Please help me identify this modern gothic calligraphic font (found in the comic
  book "Lillim"). It looks like I've seen it before many a time but I cannot remember
  its name. I guess it must be popular if it's used in a recent comic book. This is
  the sample compiled of several screenshots ( Sorry for the small size, I tried to
  enlarge the pictures but the font is distorted then)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample_5710.jpg]
