  and the one in the name of the book's author \"Kristina McGowan\". Is this one \"Neutraface\"?
  And the other, in the title of the book? It looks like a modern typeface, but which
  one?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.knitgrrl.com/images/ModernTopDownKnit_KM.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    odd.\r\n\r\nThe serif face looks like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller/\">Miller
    Display</a> from Font Bureau. The 'k' has a curved leg.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
