body: Does anyone know what font is used on Oprah's magazine, i.e. the "O" as well
  as the caption beneath of "THE OPRAH MAGAZINE"?  What would you suggest as the most
  similar fonts to hers that are available in Word?  Thanks for your help![img:sites/default/files/old-images/OprahMagazine_5026.jpg]

  body: The cover typefaces look like Vectora by Adrian Frutiger. Closest match in
    Word app would be Franklin Gothic. The O is some kind of Bodoni. Closest match
    for THE OPRAH MAGAZINE in Word would be Gill Sans.
