  one. i would like to here from you, what you can recommend me to go on with. i have

  body: 'I would do some fine-tuning to make it look less blobby: open up the bowl
    of the ''a'' to the right a bit, widen the bowl of the ''b'' towards the stem.
    Also, look at the foot of the ''a''. Very nice start!'

  body: It's hard to tell without a pdf, and only a selection of letters, but it looks
    like the horizontal strokes are slightly too thick. There's something funny with
    the straight arches on the m,n and u. Can you post something more?
