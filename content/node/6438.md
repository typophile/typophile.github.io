  body: I have to say that Dwiggins, for me, still feels so fresh. He really did do
    some amazing book work.

  body: Someone got a GREAT deal on the Currency book. I tried to bid at the end but
    missed it by seconds. I actually have a copy I got on eBay a little while back
    that was still a &#34;good&#34; deal. A second copy would have been nice, but
    I have to save up for Prague :^&#41;

    enough! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
