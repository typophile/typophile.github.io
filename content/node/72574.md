body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've been using Helvetica/Neue quite a bit for the last couple
  of years ago, and it has become one of my favorite fonts - a true classic, in my
  opinion. Recently, I decided that my resume needed some freshening up, so I thought
  about redesigning using Helvetica.\r\n\r\nBut I'm having a difficult time getting
  over a feeling that's been growing on me for the last year or so - that Helvetica
  is overused. A pretty obvious observation, perhaps, but it never deterred me from
  using it until recently. CNN, Apple, BusinessWeek magazine, more recently BBC News
  - heck, even The Weather Channel - have all adopted it, and I feel like it's just
  too prevalent. I mean, it's always been very popular, but it's starting to annoy
  me a bit now.\r\n\r\nI'm not too sure where I'm headed with this - a complaint about
  the ubiquitous nature of Helvetica, counsel as to whether or not I should use it
  on a resume or potential replacements, or both - but I'd be interested in hearing
  your opinion. Thanks!"

    could you live with yourself the morning after?"

  body: I think you need to watch the movie Helvetica. If you're just noticing its
    ubiquitousness, that's not really a good sign.

    if asked explain the history of the use of Courier in the business documents.
    \r\n\r\nThe fact that this is how most historical documents looked and how it

    taken from the typewriter ball or metal strike and not the printed output and
    often lighter than the intended output. \r\n\r\nExplain the various types of monospaced/fixed
    pitch fonts: Courier, Courier New, Letter Gothic, Prestige Elite are preferred
    by government and software engineers, they are the technological 'crystal goblet'
    of communication and shows you are not messing around. \r\n\r\nAn over designed
    resum\xE9 is clearly trying to hide the facts. \r\n\r\nregards,\r\n\r\nvincent
