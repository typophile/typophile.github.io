  It was used in Eugenio Montale's second book of poetry, Le Occasioni. It was printed
  by Giovanni Capella, and the publisher Einaudi has a Turino address. It was printed
  in 1945.\r\n\r\nthanks Eluard.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Quasimodo005_6212.jpg]"

    perhaps. The descenders are a little longer in this metal face.

    could also be a match. It's more delicate than Sabon, but it's difficult to tell
    what the original type was like due to ink bleed and other imperfections.

  body: Yes, Einaudi uses Simoncini Garamond. I don't know if it is a legend but I've
    read that Giulio Einaudi himself commissioned to Simoncini the design of the typeface.
    But I think it was after 1945.

    from your sample. Most of them are obviously not good matches, which you can see
    at a glance. The only trick is that there is no short sample of Estienne, because
    there was no digital version for me to use to make one, so you have to open the
    full sample to look at it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi folks,\r\nThe font used for this edition of Montale's Occasioni is Granjon
    (metal). Einaudi uses Garamond Simoncini from 1958; a true digitalisation of the
    metal type designed for Einaudi by Francesco Simoncini at the Traldi Industries
    in Bologna (made by Apple Computers in the early 90's) is owned today only by
    those few who work for Einaudi. That's my case: I've got the MacOS and the Win
    Type 1 and TT version of the Einaudi Garamond font which includes also CE set
    and SC (known as Garamond-100) but obviously I can't distribute it. I do declare
    it's just of the best text font you can use on a QuarkXPress or InDesign layout!!\r\nc.\r\n"

    Estienne was based on Granjon. Other Granjon samples I have seen did not match
    the posted sample, in particular the long center arm of the E, and the ascender
    and descender length. The R of Estienne is also supposed to differ from Granjon.
    \ G.W. Jones also designed the Linotype version of Granjon shown in Jaspert and
    designed Estienne a few years later.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    I know for sure that Einaudi printed books using only two typefaces before the
    Garamond of F. Simoncini: Bodoni and Granjon. I'll try to ask some old typographer
    of the Editor to get more precise information about the question (and maybe a
    sample of the alphabet).\r\nc.\r\n\r\na further note on the einaudi garamond:
    it has really nothing to do with the simoncini garamond you can purchase for example
    from adobe, linotype, scangraphic, urw or e&f. this one's a real masterpiece,
    drawn so close to the metal exemplar.\r\nc."
