  the description.\r\n\r\nThe festival will be a celebration of the vibrant culture,
  art, history and adaptive re-use of the Lower Grand Avenue arts and small business
  district and adjoining neighborhoods."

    adaptive re-use\" at all. The logo, right now, really could be for any street
    anywhere. \r\n\r\nI'd also look for alternatives to Mistral. It's a face that
    has been overused to the point where it's suffers the same stigma as Comic Sans
    or Papyrus. \r\n\r\n"

    an avenue by itself. No need for a fancy clipart skyline in the back.\r\n\r\nFirst
    design a good logo composition in b and w. No need for strokes and colors yet.\r\n\r\n"

    for it and you are using an actual outlined font.\r\n\r\nAs for the leaf\u2026\_Though
    that's a bit of a clich\xE9 nowadays, if you still wish to keep it in the design,
    there's definitely margin for improvement there, too."

  body: "Is there some significance behind the leaf? It just feels a bit random and
    out of place. I could maybe see if it was a red leaf and designed for a fall festival,
    but as is it just feels a bit irrelevant.\r\n"
