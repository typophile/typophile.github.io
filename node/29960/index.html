  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m working on a design of a menu (also called an “end plate”) for television and I was wondering how fellow members felt about writing and reading date + time on TV and the legibility issue. On rare occasions, at the end of the “promo” we have to put a title of the show, specific date in the month &amp; time. This end plate/ menu appears usually for about 4-5 sec with the reviling of the type, so this information stays on usually fully revealed for about 3 sec. So, you can see there is definitely a challenge in delivering it, as this message must be as concise as possible. Also, one thing I should mention that devices like “dot” and “commas” don’t work that well on TV as they tend to disappear.  So, here are some ways of doing it:</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>1
Name of the show
December 10  9 PM E/P</p>
<p>2
Name of the show
December 10 / 9 PM E/P</p>
<p>3
Name of the show
December 10TH -  9 PM E/P</p>
<p>4
Name of the show
10 December  9 PM E/P</p>
<p>5
Name of the show
December 10
9 PM E/P</p>
<p>As you can see the, the first objective is to convey the date, and the time is the secondary message. The title of the show is about 30-36 points and could appear in two lines and the date &amp; time is about 22 points (usually in different color). The typeface is your regular sans-serif and the TV channel is in North America.</p>
<p>First, here I my thoughts on it and please feel free to give me your opinion and suggestions.</p>
<p>1
This example is quite common on TV, but is quite problematic, because even if we put a couple of spacing between the day &amp; time, they tend “merge” and became unreadable altogether. However, many people would argue that is a the way the average person would read the date here in North America.</p>
<p>2
This case is quite similar to 1 and has similar problems.</p>
<p>3
Is a solution in a way to 1&amp;2, but becomes quite lengthy, and 10+TH could impair the reading in a way.</p>
<p>4
Is a solution I personally favor, however critics would say that “this is not the way people would usually read the date in North America”. However, I believe that the way brain perceives this information and reading it is quite different thing.</p>
<p>5
Could be a solution to 1,2,3 &amp; 4, however it alters the overall design of the message and can appear quite overwhelming.</p>
<p>I’m really sorry about this lengthy post, but I would really appreciate member’s opinion &amp; insight on this issues. I believe it is a simple legibility issue, meaning which message would be clearer in less than 3 sec. Also, I’m sorry I can’t reveal the name of the network as it could get in trouble. Thanks very much,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

<p>I guess my topic is not as interesting as “designers have a huge role to play in society”. Ironically, these details actually affect millions of people who watch TV, but we tend to care less about it than the printed medium I guess.</p>
<p>Anyway, any comments are welcome, you don’t need to be an expert. Thanks !</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d guess a lot of the problem solving will be in how you set the type. Could you share samples?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Jennifer. I have a strong attraction to 5 and here&rsquo;s why: I think it takes a long time to parse the others when more than one thing is happening on a line. I don&rsquo;t know if an en-dash (or even a bullet) with space on either side would be more quickly taken in than a slash, but even though 5 goes to three lines, each line is its own topic in a sense. So as I look them over, I keep feeling that the gestalt of the three simple lines enters my brain faster than the two more complex lines &ndash; I don;t have to slow down and figure out what&rsquo;s happening when it changes from date to time. Does this make any sense?</p>

<p>This way you are clearly breaking up formatting between the date, and you make sure the hour can&rsquo;t be mistaken for a date.</p>
<p>Also put the &lsquo;th&rsquo; as a superscript. People might not read it, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll unconsciously accept the symbol for either a &lsquo;st&rsquo;, &lsquo;nd&rsquo;, &lsquo;rd&rsquo; or &lsquo;th&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Would be my preference because it separates the numerals, although it does change your hierarchy of the information. I have an imaginary conversation in my mind, ‘when is so-and-so on?’, ‘9 o’clock on December 10th’ (I must stop having these conversations).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Pierre, showing time in the proper format as opposed to dropping the “:00” would make it read better. I would leave the  ”th” out, as people already read dates that way without the extra letters. And unless there&rsquo;s a shortage of space, just spell out ”Eastern/Pacific.” It&rsquo;s one thing to abbreviate in print where people have time to figure things out, but people who read or think slowly might not figure the E/P out fast enough to notice it at all.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks everyone ! It definitely gives me something to think about. It seems like #5 seems to strike a consensus. Also, Pierre suggestion of adding :00 helps a lot and at the same time does not alter overall design.</p>
<p>So modified #3 &amp; #5 would look as following:</p>
<p>3
Name of the show
December 10th, 9:00 PM E/P</p>
<p>5
Name of the show
December 10th
9 PM E/P     (or 9:00 PM E/P)</p>
<p>I’ll try to answer some of the question:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in television, broadcast designers set &amp; design templates, but it’s editors/credit producers that actually do this stuff on daily basis and they usually have very little or no knowledge of typography. As a result, they hardly every kern words/letter and the best they can do is add more spacing, so it’s quite “crude” process.</p>
<p>Secondly, the tools they use does not allow them to use “en dash” or “superscript”, so the “th” would have to be either lower case of upper case only. E/P is means Eastern &amp; Pacific time, meaning the show would be airing at the same time in both of these time zones. E/P has to be abbreviated due to luck of space.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for all the suggestion. I find it very refreshing to hear it from people outside of TV, as TV people are usually biased towards certain solution&hellip;</p>
