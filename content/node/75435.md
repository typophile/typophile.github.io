body: "Hey I would like to know the names of these two typefaces that I found in a
  book. I need the exact name of these, not anything that is just similar. \r\n\r\nI've
  attached the file, but I also uploaded it to the web, and here is the address...

  you so much for all of your help! I really appreciate it. Even if you can throw
  me in the direction that I should look in... like what is the name of that kind
  of \"W\" that criss-crosses in the first typeface...\r\nand what is it called when
  the P in ALPS doesn't connect to the stem? If you could give me the terminology
  then I might have some luck on my own. \r\n\r\nThe typefaces that I've thought might
  be them, but turned out not to be are:\r\nFutura\r\nKabel\r\nNoir\r\nRegulator\r\nPalladium"

    Thread</a> is a close version of it (but not the same).

    the book was published in 1973 if that helps at all

  body: trajan is close, but i don't think that is it. the serifs don't fit quite
    right and the crossbar on the A is lower in mine

  body: None of the alternatives listed [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/trajan/?&sample_text=ALPS&sample_size=96&update=0|here]]
    match exactly your image. Trajan itself and Cresci are the nearest. Maybe this
    is a Trajan variation not converted to digital format.
