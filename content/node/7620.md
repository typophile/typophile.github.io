body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Im having problems with printing. The images on my screen are different
  in tone and colour than when they are printed out. <BR>This has always been the
  case and I want to know is there a way I can set up photoshop so my printed page
  is as close as possible to the screen.  <BR> <BR>Or am I kidding myself? <BR> <BR>Thanks,
  <BR>David.

  body: ColorSync workflow. Your printer should come with ICC profiles. What you need
    to do is buy a spider that will create a profile for your screen &#40;Gretag McBeth
    is most in favor&#41;. That should allow you to get accurate results. <BR> <BR>If
    you are not already doing this, you can convert your image in PShop directly from
    RGB to a printer specific profile if you are not using the image for traditional
    process printing. <BR> <BR>Good Luck.
