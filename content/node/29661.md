  body: "OK, I checked everything. Nick, I think you nailed it. Apart from the narrower
    UC 'D', <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.8295.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=60&sampleText=Destricted&sampleSize=74\">Times
    Modern</a> is indeed a perfect match.\r\n\r\nStephen, why do you think this is
    ITC Bookman? The sample has sharp, pointy serifs, while ITC Bookman's got <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.125939.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=60&sampleText=Destricted&sampleSize=48\">chunky
    rectangular ones</a>. Any amount of [[squooshed|squooshing]] the type will never
    get you anywhere close.\r\n\r\n"

  body: BTW Nick, <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/eventseducation/film/6054.htm>Destricted</a>
    is "a compilation of erotic films intended to illuminate the points where art
    meets sexuality." Indeed not one to watch with your mother.
