  I could get some tips and tricks from the pros. Anything that might help me get

  well, I&#39;ve seen post after post in this forum commenting on good grays, grayplay,
  etc. Could someone explain this, and how to create it? <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: Hi Myke. I dont know but i believe that with the greyplay fonts you are must
    be talking to the greys that a not filled pixels,figures like my curves. I can
    get at the same time Print unique details, as a display font plus a diferent kind
    of greys, it looks like it works great to view it small in any screen as a postcript
    or truetype font. Look at the Flash &amp; Photoshop preview of my Ohiggins..

  body: 'Choosing the right grays &#40;2 is good, 5 is too many&#41; is probably the
    single most important tangible decision you&#39;ll make. The other &#34;secret&#34;
    is getting in the groove of grayscale design: it has elements of both b&amp;w
    and &#40;to a lesser extent&#41; outline font creation, but it requires its own
    mindframe too. <BR> <BR>BTW, Luciano, your Flash stuff isn&#39;t coming out at
    100% magnification &#40;at least not on my end&#41;, so everything is super blurry.
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>So you guys like &#34;grayplay&#34;, eh?  :-&#41; <BR>The
    way I&#39;d like to use it though isn&#39;t to mean just grayscale font design;
    &#34;grayplay&#34; is the use of gray pixels to simulate subtleties, like lightening
    of joins and bending of stems. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: How do you create gray pixels in font design? I thought everything was either
    on or off. I had no idea you could do &#34;textured&#34; fonts.

  body: Myke, take a look here <BR><a href="http://www.fontsforflash.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fontsforflash.com/</a>
    &#40;Super Pixel Fonts&#41; <BR>and here. <BR><a href="http://www.truthindesign.com/gray-cell.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.truthindesign.com/gray-cell.html</a> <BR> <BR>I would
    start by painting the font you want, and try this &#39;greyplay&#39; as they call
    it. Seek the right grey between Black and White. Photoshop or any similar program
    is good for this. Then build the font. <BR> <BR>--- <BR>Whenever I drop a swf
    file into a browser, it enlarges to the browser window. o&#39;higgins got all
    blurry. Does anyone know how to view swfs correctly without having to resize the
    window.

    select save link to disk.
