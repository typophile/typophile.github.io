  body: I looked at that and thought it wasn&#39;t. Do you think Din has been used
    and abused too much then? This is my worry, just trying to find something that
    will last.

  body: I&#39;m not convinced the large sample Zev posted is the same face as Badger&#39;s
    first sample. In the large sample, the s has a different curve and is narrower,
    as is the n.
