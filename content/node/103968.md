    has... and would like to have. Also: Do they specialize in certain kinds of landscaping?
    And: What do other parts of the design look like? For example, do they have a

      they do football grounds to just a small front yard. So far they only specified
      that they like the logo to be simple and we agreed on different designs of grass,
      but they want the font to stand out.  So that\u2019s where I need help please. "
