body: I&#39;m using Mac OS X 10.2.6, and InDesign 2. I can&#39;t get InD to behave
  when it comes to Arabic typesetting. Does anyone know how to whip it into shape?
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tried adding Arabic to the &#34;input menu&#34; that is system
  wide, but then that language is disabled in InD. When I copy and paste Arabic text
  into InD, it comes through backwards, and all characters are isolated &#40;no connecting
  forms&#41;. <BR> <BR>Lastly, Lucida Grande is the only font with Arabic support
  that I can get to even show up in the font menu. I haven&#39;t purchased any, but
  there are several other fonts that ship with Mac OS X that have Arabic support,
  none of which show up when installed. <BR> <BR>Is anyone here doing Arabic typesetting?
  In InDesign? <BR> <BR>Shukran, <BR>baaaAAAAAdeen! <BR> <BR>Alan <BR> <BR>PS - is
  there a way to disable the Command-space shortcut to switch between languages in
  the input menu? This is, of course, beyond annoying for designers. Zoom in ... no!
  switch languages!

    <BR>Don&#39;t know if this supports Arabic layout through OpenType Layout or AAT,
    might be best to check with Winsoft if you&#39;re looking to use a specific exisiting
    font. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si '

    or something on the lines of Davkawriter for Hebrew to convert the writing to
    work in a left to right programme.

  body: I&#39;m using InDesign ME. It uses OpenType for Arabic glyph substitution,
    and has a variety of options for vowel positioning &#40;OpenType GPOS, blind positioning,
    its own algorithm, and user-adjustment&#41;. I&#39;m generally very impressed
    with this product.

  body: 'Thanks for your feedback, everyone, this is helpful. <BR> <BR>John: are you
    using InDesign ME in conjunction with any of the other ME products? or are you
    able to export PDFs without any problems? <BR> <BR>And lastly, have you gotten
    the impression that the extended script support will be rolled into a future release
    of the standard InDesign, or is it too much of a niche market? <BR> <BR>Thanks!'

  body: I can export PDFs direct from InDesign ME without problem. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t
    comment on whether extended script support will be rolled into the regular InDesign.
    I&#39;d like to see that happen. Since Winsoft are so far ahead of Adobe on GPOS
    handling, it would be great to see their code rolled into Adobe&#39;s layout engine.
