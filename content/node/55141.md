  hoped that some of you might be able to point me in the right direction...\r\n\r\nI
  am a student at Kingston University and am currently trying to develop an experimental
  typeface based upon information getting corrupted/changed the more its reproduced.
  For this I have started creating a typeface whos letterforms change depending on
  how many times you use them. \r\n\r\nIn order to do this I am currently in the process
  of designing about 50-60 varients of the font and I wondered if anyone knew of a
  way to have the font change which varient it selects based on how many times its
  been used e.g. the 6th time a letter g gets used it would uses varient 6 of letter
  g.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is possible or not but I thought I would see if anyone
  on here had any suggestions/advice.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: In keeping with your theme, it might be more interesting not to manually design
    fifty variants of the font, but design the <em>variables</em> that then change/deteriorate
    it "automatically". Just a thought.

  body: "Hi itsluke\r\n\r\nRobert Bringhurst's 'The Elements of Typographic Style'
    has a great little discussion of exactly what you're talking about in Section
    9.3.2: Manual, Random and Programmed Variation. He uses the example of a typeface
    called Beowolf by Fontshop, which uses a small program embedded in the font to
    introduce random variation to the letterforms.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand,
    OpenType fonts can contain embedded programs that can achieve what you're thinking
    of. You'd have to create a small program to count how many times the face has
    been called upon for a certain letterform, and introduce greater variation the
    more times the character has been called. I don't know the technical details or
    limitations of OpenType, but I think it can be very flexible.\r\n\r\nSo, look
    into OpenType, Beowolf and snatch a copy of Bringhurst out of the Uni library.\r\nHope
    this helps,\r\n\r\nSebastian"

  body: "OpenType has an internal scripting language, which allows you to program
    features for it. Unfortunately, it's not a complete programing language. It's
    mostly for specifying glyph substitutions and positioning info. No variables,
    no arithmetic, no fancy stuff. I'm facing a similar problem, trying to code a
    font that can change optical size automatically (through glyph subs) depending
    on what size a text is set in. We're both trying to make a font do things based
    on external factors, which I don't think OpenType can handle without a lot of
    hacking.\r\n\r\nWhen Erik van Blokland and Just van Rossum designed Beowulf, they
    did all the coding in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript\">PostScript</a>,
    which is a real Turing-complete programming language. Their code was being run
    by the output device, i.e. the printer. If you're working on a font designed for

  body: "I recently designed a <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=ODEx\">pseudo-random
    Opentype font</a> that cycles through three subsets. I started using Thomas Phinney\u2019s
    code :\r\n\r\nfeature calt {\r\nlookup rotate {\r\n  sub @default @default' by
    @alt1;\r\n  sub @alt1 @default' by @alt2;\r\n  <em>etc ad infinitum</em>\r\n}
    rotate;\r\nlookup rotate;\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\nThe Phinney method worked, but Indesign
    flakes out and will occasionally disable CALT at the beginning of a line after
    a series of lines cycling like this. In Illustrator CALT is off by default, and
    in many programs it\u2019s simply unsupported. So Silas Dilworth came up with
    the brilliant idea of writing a PHP script to build a cycling engine based on
    LIGA. It works very well, and is supported by a lot more software. The downside
    is that for a 1144 character font there are 1536 lines of LIGA code. It also tends
    to chug along in some apps. I honestly don\u2019t know how it works so you\u2019ll
    have to get in touch with him (try Facebook) for an explanation.\r\n\r\nSomething
    you need to consider before you go too far with this project is the number of
    glyphs and file size. If you do 60 permutations of a 256-character font you\u2019ll
    have over 15,000 glyphs, if you\u2019re adding lots of points to change the shapes
    that means you\u2019ll end up with a pretty big file and won\u2019t be able to
    master the font in Fontlab (but you could do it with Fontforge, Asia Font Studio,
    AFDKO or combinations of them). I have no idea what kind of software problems
    you\u2019ll run into with a font that big, but plan ahead and assume you\u2019ll
    run into some."

    in reintroducing the subtle imperfections of analog print through digital means,
    which is why I'm pursuing OpenType randomness (though I'll settle for regular
    cycling). As Part of my grad thesis I'm looking into ways that digital type can
    reclaim ground lost to photo and hot metal. It would be nice if a font could adjust
    itself optically according to point size, especially on the web or mobile devices.
    there's plenty we can make type do, and no reason to let it stagnate simply because
    people don't want to deal with the inconvenience of experimenting. \r\n\r\nJohn,
    you are certainly right about \"scripting language\" being a bit f an undeserved
    complement to the AFDKO feature language. If only the powers that be had decided
    to make digital fonts be actual programs instead of mere system extensions...\r\n\r\nI
    wonder what it would take to make fonts more powerful. OpenType offers a lot of
    flexibility, but the inherent status of fonts on modern operating systems is holding
    them (and us) back.\r\n\r\n\u2014Noam"

    Black Monday I started by spending a tremendous amount of time distressing type
    by hand. It was a waste of time. I realized that in the digital realm, all you
    can ever do is simulate. Vector type will never come close to the imperfections
    of metal type. Massive photofonts with character randomizers and baseline randomizers
    and anything else anyone thinks of will never convince anybody that they\u2019re
    metal type. Things get more interesting when we just embrace the digital size
    of things and exploit all the great stuff digital type gives us instead of trying
    to recreate a technology that has as beauty all its own.\r\n\r\n<cite>I wonder
    what it would take to make fonts more powerful.</cite>\r\n\r\nFor the most parts
    fonts don\u2019t need to be more powerful, the end-users just need to do a better
    job setting their type. The answer to optical sizing is not having OpenType do
    it automatically, it\u2019s getting designers who don\u2019t even know how to
    use old-style figures to RTFM. Making all this stuff automatic will not, for the
    most part, make typography better, it will just create more headaches because
    of all the people who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. "
