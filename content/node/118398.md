  something interesting with the ClearType fonts. Calibri, Cambria and Consolas all
  were \"modified\" in 2012. Constantia however, was not modified that year. \r\n\r\nScroll
  down to \"Modified Date\":\r\nCalibri: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1914\r\nCambria:
  http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=2112\r\nConstantia: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=2053\r\n\r\nWhat
  does this mean? Was Constantia already 'perfect' in 2009, so it didn't need modification
  in 2012?"
