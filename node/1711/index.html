Thus quoth: <BR><blockquote><b>Font Capture</b> <BR>Fonts can be captured dynamically and saved to hard disk or flash memory in the printer. A captured font appears as a printer resident font. If many fonts are used in jobs that are printed, capturing fonts and saving them in the printer will decrease network traffic on busy networks.</blockquote> <BR><a href="http://www.lexmark.com/AP/PH/solutions/simmipds_twc.html" target="_blank">http://www.lexmark.com/AP/PH/solutions/simmipds_twc.html</a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">You&#39;re welcome. <BR> <BR>... this reminds me of when I was doing bits and pieces of tech support at Image Club when Mac System 7 was first released. Some machines were prone to throwing generic &#39;Type 1&#39; errors when older applications were not playing nicely with the new OS. The error window would come up on screen, freezing everything, and without supplying any additional information - descriptive or otherwise - to explain what had happened. Since Image Club was selling and supporting <i>type one PostScript</i> fonts in our font library, naturally customers who experienced this error message wanted to know why the fonts we sold them were causing their system to crash. Heh.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, upgrade to XP Pro.  Home is a POS as far as security is concerned. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re concerned about things floating around on computer, get AdAware, it&#39;s a free download and it detects spyware.  Should be at <a href="http://www.lavasoft.de" target="_blank">www.lavasoft.de</a>. <BR> <BR>Also, if you&#39;re on broadband, definitely recommended to get a firewall.  <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com" target="_blank">www.zonelabs.com</a> has ZoneAlarm, another freebie, which is really good.  Plus it tells you when any programme tries to get access to the internet and allows you to take action to stop it. <BR> <BR>If you don&#39;t have one, get a virus scanner as well.  I recommend Norton&#39;s Antivirus &#40;just the Antivirus, none of the other crap they sell&#41;.  It&#39;s pretty good at detecting vira, and it also is able to find new vira that aren&#39;t listed in it&#39;s definitions files through several scanning algorithms.</div>

My brother, and PC tech, stated, &#34;well, the start up item could be anywhere on your machine...there isn&#39;t a specific place that start up items have to exist&#34;. <BR> <BR>Things like that is why people that write virii prefer Windows ;o&#41;</div>

After about 15 or 20 posts, the Mac lobby, with nowhere to go, because they have necessarily lost the argument starts to come up with &#39;oh no, the Mac/PC debate, how boring&#39;, despite the fact that they didn&#39;t find it boring before their claims were shot down. <BR>So, this time I&#39;m getting in first. <BR>PCs are better than Macs in every way, the end. <BR>Anyone who cares to argue with this is obviously a sad geeky loser who needs to trade in their Mac and get a life. </div>

I use them, and I also use PCs, but Grant&#39;s comment that he doesn&#39;t have to worry about anything like that because he has a mac just ticked me off. <BR> <BR>You do NOT have to have a security hole to have a virus.  Some vira do take advantage of security holes, but the vast majority of vira are ones that the user has to install themselves &#40;unknowningly of course&#41; and they&#39;re the ones you have to watch out for.  You get an email from a friend saying they&#39;ve included a screensaver of cutesy little kittens so you decide to try it yourself and bam...you&#39;ve just installed a virus that wipes out your windows directory the next time you start the computer. <BR> <BR>If Macs were the leading computer used today, the windows users would be probably be laughing at them for getting vira all the time. <BR> <BR>Virus users go after the biggest target.  Why shoot for the can when you can hit the barn much easier?  Which isn&#39;t to say, of course, that people don&#39;t shoot for the can, because there ARE Mac vira out there.  You just don&#39;t hear about them as often because it&#39;s the PC vira that get all the news.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey. <BR> <BR>As of late, I &#40;and I suspect I&#39;m not alone&#41; have started to feel a little, errr..., &#34;uncool&#34; if I don&#39;t get virus emails. Since most of the recent ones spread by email address books, the more virii you get, the more address books you&#39;re in.  <BR> <BR>Of course it really probably has a lot more to do with the tech-savvyness of your peers I s&#39;pose, but... <BR> <BR>Computer viruses have made for some interesting changes. I remember when I was working for a Seattle dot-com, the notices the IT department would tape all over the place whenever there was a new viral outbreak. A cyber-quarantine. <BR> <BR>David Roughs <BR></div>

I believed I was simply stating the obvious. I really don&#39;t worry about anything. Yes, I run anti-viral software - but I can&#39;t remember the last time anything ever triggered a warning. And I&#39;m not operating is some sterile, non-networked environment. My home Mac has a public IP address and is wide open on several ports. Other than spam, I have never had a single infection or breach. I feel secure running a Macs. I feel vulnerable every time I touch a Windows box and I wonder if I&#39;m going to be able to boot up tomorrow. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>...because there ARE Mac vira out there.</i> <BR>&#62;<i>You just don&#39;t hear about them as often</i> <BR>&#62;<i>because it&#39;s the PC vira that get all the news.</i> <BR> <BR>True. But you also don&#39;t hear about them, because they&#39;re pretty much non-existent at this point in the game &#40;other than Microsoft-borne macro vira, but that&#39;s another issue altogether&#41; or else they&#39;re harmless, benign annoyances. <BR> <BR>Of course, this is my own opinion based on 25 years of personal experience with multiple computing platforms. I&#39;ll completely accept the fact that other&#39;s milage may vary.</div>

I do admit to feeling a bit vulnerable &#40;maybe that keeps me alive? I hate insurance for example - like that guy in Deliverance&#41;, but the fact is nothing has happened yet &#40;yes, I know &#34;yet&#34; might be the operative word here :-&#41;, and if there <i>is</i> a virus it&#39;s not doing anything damaging. I take some basic precautions &#40;like not using MS Outlook, and never running emailed executables, or accepting downloads from strange sites&#41;, but I&#39;m no recluse, so I&#39;m sure I&#39;m some kind of target to some people. So basically it&#39;s not that bad. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">My hypothesis why there are few mac viruses is that mac  <BR>developers are a&#41; so busy defending their chosen platform and <BR>b&#41; too proud of their platform to do anything to hurt the  <BR>mac community. It&#39;s about pride of ownership, not only a  <BR>numbers game &#40;more PC users means more PC viruses&#41;. <BR> <BR>Ahem, that&#39;s my hypothesis anyway. I&#39;d love to find some  <BR>facts to support it. <BR> <BR>And I don&#39;t know why you should be upset that we don&#39;t  <BR>have to worry about viruses. Statistically it&#39;s true. Mac users  <BR>don&#39;t get viruses... I think in the 12 years I&#39;ve used them  <BR>that I&#39;ve gotten viruses twice. &#40;Both were worms.&#41;</div>
