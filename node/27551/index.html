Whenever there is a URL to be typeset I get really annoyed by the three W´s. Those characters will never space nicely and they don´t give any information anyway. So therefore I thought of a new sign, a new character, to replace `WWW´. And it looks like this

Anyone in favor of adding a new sign to the world? Any suggestions are more than welcome!

There are a lot of new "afkortingen"(shortings?" in modern communication which could be replaced bij somekind of "ligature". What about 'fax', 'tel' or perhaps even labels on forms and businesscards 'name', 'Adress', 'Country'. What happens in other languages? Are there any Japanese or Arabic solutions to this?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the thread. Very interesting. But everybody's writing nice options without much real visual proposals. The large W with the two small w's beside is nice, but not a serious option in my view, because it takes up too much space. A W combined with a 3 is a thought, but remember that people should always have the option to use three w's instead of the new sign.

One of the comments had me thinking. Wouldn't it be a nice idea to use a very simple globe as a sign for the world (!) wide web?

i am not a big fan of the clumsy 'www' either, yet instead of finding a replacement i've just started dropping this useless bit of info from all stationary etc that i designed. If you set contact info, it is just so obvious isn't it? ie. if it says typophile.com , what else then a web address could it be?

Your www figure is brilliant. Granted, I agree with seb's comment that we can simply drop the www and go with the straight ".com" name and not miss a beat. But in those cases where "www" is required I think your ligature will work beautifully. This should be implemented into font character sets. Heck, it's not only functional and clear, but it also looks very stylish. </div>

Thanks for your reply.

The temptation to leave out www is indeed present. But still it has a function. It is indicating that a web adress is following. Just like the at-sign is always a part of an email adress and immediately recognisable. Therefore a single character might even be stronger than three characters.

Anyone still interested in the sans version? (I chose Frutiger for this purpose.)

Your proposal makes sense to me; if we can do this for currency signs like the euro, then why not for more frequent glyphs like communication symbols. Rather than creating a specific sans and serif version, you might consider publishing guidelines for how people can make this glyph in any font they are developing...</div>

I like your design, it is really short and works well despite it is a new sign. (I doubt it would work for Sofa, as with equal stroke-weight, everything gets very claustrophobic fast...)

Visually, I agree, though technically speaking, this isn't necessarily true.

An email address must have an @ sign. 

A URL doesn't have to have the www at all, and, these days, most competant sysadmins know enough not to require the www to get to one's web site.

As such, I'd agree that the solution to the problem is to just drop the www altogether. I think the presence of a .com/org/net/etc is enough to clearly indicate a URL these days.</div>

Nice sketches. Thanks. Looking forward to your new font.

Alumin:

You are right. URL can indeed exist without the 'www'. But as far as I know most top level URLs, the ones mentioned on ads, do start with 'www'.

Anyway, the sign might still help in saving space and also help in making it look a little better.

To find out if the sign would still work on a sans font, I did a Frutiger version. It might look like this, though I'm not complete satisfied, because the inner w's do not have the same nice proportions as in the serif version.

That's a completely arbitrary thing most of the time. It's just an old habit. And if the old habit is 'ugly' then the solution, IMHO, is to drop it. And I do see a lot more folks dropping the www. in their marketing. Off the top of my head, my 4 year old walks around the house singing 'pbs kids dot org' each morning. 

Not that this isn't an interesting challenge. It is, and is fun, but I'm not sure how practical it actually is in real world use. Is it more useful to have an odd looking glyph that might take a second look to fully understand or to just drop it altogether?

anything.yourdomain.com is fine.

so, yes, you can have both

typography.linotype.com
www.typography.linotype.com

and have them point to different web sites. In which case, yes, you'd have to have the www for one of them and not the other.

Some site still require the www. as without it, their domain points at a completely different site. However, I'd say that is defintely the exception these days and is bad practice.

Again, I'm merely speaking from a pragmatic usage standpoint. I still think the excercise in terms of typography is both fun and useful.

But, if you name the glyph w_w_w then Adobe Reader will extrapolate that it's a ligature for the sequence of characters named w, w, and w.  If you wanted to do a ligature for "http://www.", then you would name it
<code>h_t_t_p_colon_slash_slash_w_w_w_period</code> and the resulting text for copy and paste or other purposes would be as expected.  If you named it "weblig" though, a copy and paste or whatnot will give garbled results.  

You would assign a unicode value of -1, unless any of the psuedo-standards for the PUA include a glyph for it already, in which case I'd use that.
