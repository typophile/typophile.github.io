    difficulties in thinking about 'ideal' proportions is that you can compare the
    h-ascender to the x-height, the overshoot heights of the O and o, the h ascender
    to the o overshoot height. So if one of the ratios hits 'golden' exactly,the others
    won't. \r\n\r\nSo in the end, as I suppose Nick would agree, you just have to

  body: "Hi Duncan. The explanatory diagram you are searching for does exist (it's
    just that at the moment it's in my office on a bookshelf and I can't remember
    which book it's in...)\r\n\r\nSomeone else on typophile is likely to give you
    an improvement on what I set out here, but briefly; it's all about the respective
    widths of key characters in the uppercase.\r\n\r\nClassic proportions for typeface
    designs are those based on Roman inscriptional lettering (eg. <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/8565/trajanregular-font.html\">Trajan</a>)where
    the uppercase O is oval, the M is slightly wider than the square of its height,
    and the uppercase N is approximately half of this M width. The 'narrow' letters
    of the uppercase alphabet E,F,L and S etc. all follow the width of the N.\r\n\r\nThe
    renaissance designers followed this model for proportion in their various Oldstyle/Garalde
    designs. The proportions were overhauled and rationalised about three centuries
    later with the arrival of the Modern/Didone proportions in which uppercase O is
    circular (wider than its predecessors), M is narrower and N is square \u2013 having
    a significant roll-on effect on the proportions of the rest of the uppercase (E,F,L
    and S all becoming much wider). Its effect was to regularise the widths of the
    letters.\r\n\r\nIn sans serif designs, the early (19thc) grotesques (eg. <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/13428/monotypegrotesqueroman-font.html\">Monotype
    Grotesque</a>) often vestigally followed Oldstyle proportions, while the later
    20thc rationalisations of this style \u2013 the neo grotesques (eg. Helvetica,
    Univers <em>at al</em>) were drawn up to modern proportions.\r\n\r\nHope this
    helps."

  body: "The proportions of the classic Roman capitals fall into groups. My memory
    fails me but generally, I believe it is that there are groupings that most letters
    fall into (but there was always optical compensation). There were the circular
    letters or O group. Circular is not meant exactly, much compensation was made.
    While the D, C, and G, were in the group with the O and Q, they were actually
    a stroke width narrower (as becomes quite obvious when drawing them). The middle
    width was the N, H, A, V, and T (later U). The so-called half-width group was
    the, S, R, P, E, and F--keep in mind that they were neither exactly half nor exactly
    the same width as the eye was the final arbiter. The wide letter M and W were
    wider than O but not twice as wide as N. Overlapping two Vs a bit gives you the
    W and a V with arms gave you the M. Again, this is not micrometer exact measurement.
    Just as we today optically adjust, so did they--I wonder what the Roman word for
    overshoot was :-) The capitals I and J were clearly odd balls and pieced from
    the strokes and partial curves of the rest. The Trajan column letters are not
    exactly the same width even with the repeated letters. You must admit that those
    old codgers did one hell of a fine job anyway though!\r\nThe classical proportions
    (being clear groups of widths) are more often used to describe the difference
    between early times and more modern times when the width of letters became closer
    to the same optical width. Modern letters are still not perfect measures since
    this would make for some ugly type. Even the Bauhaus could not make the crazy
    things exactly geometrically and god knows they tried.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Really this is why I hope to either find or create some sort of chart that explains
    these concepts. That way I could refer back to it and have all the information
    in one place. \r\n\r\nSo far I understand:\r\n\r\nThat the groupings are general
    and that optical adjustments by the designers mean that there are/were not so
    hard and fast that for example one could say, \"In all Classic proportioned typefaces
    the O is a perfect circle.\"\r\n\r\nClassic Type Proportions generally fall into
    set groups of widths that are more or less designed around a square. \r\n\r\nModern
    Type Proportions are generally designed around a similar optical width.\r\n\r\nThe
    best books I have read so far that have helped my understanding on these styles
