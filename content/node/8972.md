    Rounded</a>, if you mean the captions that are on the promos. That&#39;s my guess,
    based mainly on the G.

  body: Wow! Arial Rounded! I should have known that. It&#39;s typographic identity
    was hidden in plain sight! It&#39;s been so driven into my head that using arial
    is a typographic sin that I&#39;d lost sight of it. Thanks Mike!
