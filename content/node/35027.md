body: "Hi guys, \r\n\r\nI am working on a freelance project for an Economy and Politics
  Magazine. I dunno if it will finally see the light one day or not. I was searching
  for fonts that could give functional to read as well as this conservative (as most
  of this magazines are) but with a touch of modernity and freshness. I dunno if I
  am clear.\r\n\r\nI thought for body text maybe Hoefler Text or Century Style but
  they are very well know already. For Sans type I thought of Caecilia or Officina
  Sans. \r\n\r\nNot sure yet, what do you think or like? It would be nice to have
  your oppinions.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSebastiao"
