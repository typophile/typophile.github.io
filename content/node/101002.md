  not...but here goes. I work at a school within a university, and I'm looking to
  hire someone to stylize the name of our school so that it works well with the university's
  official text logo. \r\n\r\nOf course there are plenty of graphic designers around,
  but I'd like to work with someone who specializes in fonts...b/c that's what I'm
  dealing with...stylizing four words within the context of a university logo that
  includes three elements: university / school / department. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  on how to go about finding someone who might be a good fit for this small job?\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance for any ideas. \r\n\r\nDaniel "

  body: "You might want to touch base with whoever at the university is in charge
    of their logo and identity. They may have specific rules about what's permitted
    regarding fonts, etc. They may also want to recommend a specific designer (perhaps
    a designer on their staff or the design firm that developed their identity).\r\n\r\nAt
    larger universities there may be an office devoted solely to identity rules and
    enforcement. A friend of mine does just that at a major university; most of his
    time is spent finding people using their logo without permission (on souvenirs,
    clothing, etc) and suing them. At smaller universities it may be someone in the
    office in charge of marketing and publications."
