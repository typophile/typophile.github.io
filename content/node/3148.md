  body: Looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/fairfield-lh/85-heavy/testdrive.html?s=brodie&amp;p=48">Fairfield
    Heavy</a>, vertically squished and horizontally skewed for that faux-italic look.

  body: Thanks Franz, Fairfield is a pretty close match, but I think this font is
    an actual italic, rather than a faux version. The letters are too well made to
    be merely skewed. I am starting to believe that this is a custom font. Anyone
    else have a suggestion?

  body: Wow Mark, I think you got it! All the serif details are the same, and the
    little cleft under the lower case &#34;b&#34; is dead on. I&#39;ll try skewing
    it slightly to see if I can get what I need. Thanks to you and Franz for your
    efforts.

  body: Hey, you&#39;re right! Sorry, I didn&#39;t look closely enough, some of the
    serifs on Fairfield are really off.. Good one, Mark!
