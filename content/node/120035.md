  body: Thanks. You're spot on, but looking at the apostrophe, I feel like the rounding
    is part of the face. I've added some further titling with lowercase letters.

    keep checking back\u2014I'm sure one of them will have an answer for you."

  body: "Interestingly, while still trying to track this face down, I stumbled on
    another use; it appears that a newer print of Nosferatu uses the same face for
    its title plate. This would seem to suggest this is a specific face rather than
    an optical result of the technique used to transfer type to film:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nosferatu_5267.jpg]\r\n\r\nYou
