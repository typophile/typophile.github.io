body: "I've whipped up a prototype logo for the Electrical and Computer Engineering
  department at the University I work for and wanted to get some critiques before
  I finish tweaking it and present it to the department head for approval. I'll be
  honest, I was heavily inspired when I was buying electronics one day and noticed
  the European CE mark on some cables (basically the \"meets EU safety requirements\"
  seal...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_mark). I'm not much of a logo designer...my
  talents largely reside in page design and photography, so any constructive criticism
  is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    up in a B/W photocopy, and I''m not sure that a greyscale rendering would be as
    effective.  '

  body: "Yes, nice and simple logo.\r\n\r\nAgree with Linda about the grad. Not sure
    it really adds that much for the problems you will have with reproduction? Maybe
    type and symbol solid red and solid crimson??\r\n\r\nFeel the type is a fraction
    to close to symbol.\r\nSpace between the symbol 'E' and 'C' could be very slightly
    greater for when the logo gets used at small sizes."

  body: "Will this be working standalone or along side the university mark? \r\nIf
    it's to work along side the University mark, you should check the current guidelines
    for spacing, sizing and any limitations on accompanying marks. \r\n\r\nWhat type
    of applications do you see this logo being used on? If applications include anything
    from standard forms, letterhead, embroidered/screen printing and/or web applications;
    you should consider creating various version of the logo with specific guidelines
    for each use. This would include your current gradient color choice (which would
    work best in a web/screen based environment), solid color  versions (that would
    include acceptable spot colors and patterns) and a B&W version (for small or photocopy
    production.) \r\n"

  body: I like the ever-so-slight gradient. It makes the logo kinda glow and vibrate
    - I guess you can say it gives it an electric look.

  body: The logo is too busy. You have to be able to retain an image long after looking
    at it and this one slips away in the contrasts and blending of the type.

  body: As others have already pointed out, this is too close to the symbol which
    inspired you. Two important traits of any logo are that it has to be memorable,
    and not easily confused with any other logotype.
