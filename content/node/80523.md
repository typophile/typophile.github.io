body: I took these pictures off a shirt. I'm not sure if they are the same or different
  fonts, but I'm trying to find both because I'm trying to make a copy of the shirt
  with a different back. I want the shirts to match as perfectly as possible. Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/0327011423_5488.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/downsized_0327011422_5646.jpg]
