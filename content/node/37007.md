  on my digital camera. I have printed photos taken on my digital camera at A3 before
  and they have been fine, but never A2. So Im worried the images would come out all
  pixalted.\r\n\r\nThe dpi of the photos is 180, and I will crop them all down to
  A3.\r\n\r\nDo you think it will be okay to print A2?\r\n\r\nThanks salot\r\n\r\n\r\np.s
  What do you think of the poster? There are going to be 2 more in similar vain.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_4618_6096.jpg]"

    at 180.\r\n\r\nAs for the design, I love the images, but I've been seeing an awful
    lot of that type style lately..."

  body: "Resolution is in the eye of the beholder.\r\n\r\nMost people can't really
    distinguish detail under 150th -- 200th of an inch or so... unless they're dealing
    with A) really small things, like 9 pt type, or B) aggregate details, like smooth
    gradients and the like.\r\n\r\nAnd kepp in mind that distance plays a factor...
    nobody's gonna see 1 inch details on a Billboard, but they'll notice a 1/200th
    dot on a business card.\r\n\r\nI doubt you'll have any trouble printing a poster
    at 180 ppi, unless it's going to be on display and highly scrutinized.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanks alot tdf\r\n\r\nhaha, yeah i know, but i couldnt find anyother typefaces
    i like (plus i left doing it to the last minute) so i just quickly made that one
    as im quite fond of it for headings etc. Plus i didnt want to use Akzidenz Grotesk
    for this, as i allways use it, i wanted something the complete opposite.\r\n\r\ni
    wanted to go for a hand drawn effect but i dont have a tablet or enough time to
    trace in illustrator. if anyone has recomendations for typefaces they think could
    work that would be fantastic, thanks."

  body: "Resolution in printing industry is expressed in lines per inch (lpi). Resolution
    in the digital world is expressed in dots per inch (dpi). As a rule of thumb,
    dpi should be twice the desired lpi, at 100% size.\r\n\r\nSo, to print your A2
    posters (with image covering entire poster) using a 150lpi screen (a typical screen
    for today's printer), you'll need the digital image to be 300dpi at 420mm x 594mm.

  body: Remember, most posters are viewed from a distance, so resolution isn't as
    much of a factor as something that would be scrutinized more closely, like a book
    or magazine.
