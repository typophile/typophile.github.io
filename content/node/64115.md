body: "I wonder if there is any reliable independent platform around which gives comparative
  information about fonts in their possibly latest versions. I have in mind not so
  much a search like \u201Cfree funny christmas fonts\u201D but rather specialised
  requirements, e.g. in science.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/index.html|Alan
  Wood\u2019s Unicode resources]] have been rightfully much acknowledged in the past.
  But it seems to be heavily out of date, at least with its detailed font informations.
  No wonder, this is hardly a task to be solved forever by one single man.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you fellow typophiles make of [[http://www.identifont.com/index.html|Identifont]]?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontscape.com|Fontscape]]
  seems to offer a promising approach, yet the selections presented seem to be rather
  arbitrary \u2013 and very limited.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.wazu.jp/index.html|Wazu Japan\u2019s
  page]] seems to have not been updated for some two years as well; however, it offers
  an interesting online [[http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Test_Coptic.html|font testing
  functionality]].\r\n\r\nAn universal, comprehensive and detailed font information
  system \u2013 Utopian?"

    as part of my undergraduate thesis... It is more of democratization of typographic
    data than a utopia...

    you want more in that table, the public comment period is about to commence somewhere.

    with this in the past, and found it often took me into circles. I suspect that
    few in this forum need such a tool, as they can recognize most fonts through memory,
    or a quick glance through a type guide.\r\n\r\n"

    lets you search \u201Cfind fonts which contain the U+10300 block\u201D or \u201Cfonts
    with character U+2182\u201D.\r\nMaybe, I expect too much \u2013."
