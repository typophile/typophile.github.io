    <BR>Bravo! But I was looking for a little crisper version, at least that&#39;s
    how i envisioned how this face should be. Also I&#39;m interested in both the
    Latin and Cyrillic fonts and would like to find samples of both, if at all possible.
    Gerald, could you email me and let me know how to get in touch with Robin? Thanks
    for your help on this one, people. &#39;preciatcha!

    of this face at <a href="http://www.omnibus.se/engix/lkmanus.html" target="_blank">http://www.omnibus.se/engix/lkmanus.html</a>.
    I went to the purchase options and there realy wasn&#39;t a purchase option. Anybody
