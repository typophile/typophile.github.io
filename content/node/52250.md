  guides, hints, colors off; in essence you have just the outline of the letter and
  that's it.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the very spot where the bottom left node on the inner
  contour would be, a very slight line appears heading in a downward direction ...
  almost as if you have a curve point there instead of a corner and the program is
  reading a slight extension of the southward point. However, you know after checking
  that indeed it is a corner point.\r\n\r\nSo on a whim you click the point at the
  top of the arc, move the left handle in two spaces (reducing its setting), and that
  tiny southward-pointing line goes away.\r\n\r\nThis happens all the time in various
  forms. The question is, have you improved the overall look of the letter by clicking
  that left handle in two spaces and removing the line, or is that just a little quirk
  of the program? I ask because if it does help, I need to go check all my letters
  for this minor anomoly."

  body: "Ordinarily that would help but in this case my problem can only be seen with
    everything turned off. To get an idea of what I'm looking at, open a font in FontLab,
    then any letter, and under \"View,\" turn off everything until only the skeleton
    of the letter exists. \r\n\r\nIn other words, click off everything under the \"show
    layers\" menu option. Once you've done that, you'll have in the window a letter
    that looks similar to the one above. Once you do that, if you look real close
    in your open font you might see that little extra space pictured to the right
    of the arrow on the left \"e.\" (which isn't there on the right \"e,\" which is
    what happens when I move that upper handle a few spaces to the right)\r\n\r\nIf
    you don't see it when viewing any of your letters, you can try moving a handle
    in a direction perpendicular to the direction in which that faint little line
    is showing. I know my description blows, but once you've seen a skeleton of a
    letter in FontLab, my renditions above will make more sense. Those aren't screen
    shots, I made them manually. Hopefully this will help some. I appreciate you taking
    the time to check it out."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/exa2_6089.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI apologize
    for lacking the knowledge - or perhaps the software - needed to produce a screen
    grab. Let me attempt to be more succinct.\r\n\r\nIn the above diagram is an lc
    \"e,\" with the fill outline turned off and just the outline itself showing. In
    the yellow area immediately to the right of the No. \"1,\" there is a small line
    dipping below the long horizontal bar of the inner contour. This small line is
    not visible when the fill outline is on ... only when it's off.\r\n\r\nAs you
    can see in the green shaded area numbered \"2,\" that small overlap is gone. After
    some machination I discovered that if I move the handle next to the number \"3\"
    a few spaces to the right (using the arrow button on my keyboard), that line eventually
    disappears.\r\n\r\nMy inquiry, then, is as follows: since all computers run on
    or are based in mathematics and equations, this small line next to the No. 1 obviously
    figures into how the entire glyph will be rendered since I can see it on my screen
    and can make it disappear when I move the handle next to the No. 3. Hypothetically,
    if the equation 5+5+3 ordinarily results in the visual we know as the inner contour
    of the \"e,\" logic dictates that the left glyph - with the overlap - would require
    an equation of 5+5+1+3, taking into account what I can see in the yellow shaded
    area. This leads me to wonder ... could this small overlap - which potentially
    could exist in an assortment of other glyphs in the font - be a monkey-wrench
    in the overall look of a completed font? Or is it more likely just a grain of
    sand no one will ever know exists?\r\n\r\nAlso as an aside - Mr. Cooke I noticed
    your collection recently has been made available on myfonts.com. I hope you're
    successful with that."

  body: "One way I know of to get the effect you are getting at the corner is to construct
    a curve like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/badcorner_6077.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
    happens when you push the curve around counterclockwise forcing the bottom left
    control handle below its node. The solution is to move the control handles so
    they look like the curve on the right.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that can happen is
    when you have a curve point and a corner point at the same location, like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/badcorner2_4444.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    solution in this case is to move one of the overlapping nodes away, delete the
    segment between them, and then rejoin the two nodes (thus creating a single node)."

  body: "Sorry for the delay in responding, especially when I need to thank you for
    taking time to share such great information.\r\n\r\nI went through your description
    of possibilities, but unfortunately none were the case in this situation. Both
    points on the horizontal inner contour bar were corner points, and neither handle
    in the top curve point extended past the horizontal position of either corner
    point. \r\n\r\nI suppose in reality the ultimate answer really isn't that critical
    since the best thing to do would be to simply remove these little overlaps from
    any glyphs in a font I may be creating at any given time. I can't imagine how
    removing them could do anything but help in the end, aside from perhaps being
    an unnecessary waste of time. However, between my knowledge of computers and my
    instincts where they are concerned, everything tells me these little nuisances
    are worthy enough to rectify.\r\n\r\nAlso, I went to the link you posted, copied
    the instructions and gave the screen grab thing a shot. It didn't seem to work
    for me though. I'll keep trying. In the meantime, when you again find yourself
    working on a new typeface, try going into the show layers tab, unchecking everything,
    removing the fill color of the glyphs, and see if you encounter one of these little
    pests ... which invariably appear at corner points. If you do see one, trying
    to fix it will show you what I've encountered.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the time."

  body: I'm pretty sure I can, once I've A.) found the .vfb file in which I first
    discovered the anamoly and B.) found another glyph with the same problem since
    I corrected the one in the "e" reflected in the above figures. Since even I'm
    smart enough to figure out your interest is in seeing an affected glyph and not
    my technological/communication skills, I suppose I'd need to know where to send
    it once a similarly diseased glyph is located. I tried to obtain your email via
    your profile and then your website, but at the moment your  address appears to
    be "type some body text here." I'd definitely appreciate it if you were to take
    a look under the hood and share your observations, so if you'd prefer I post my
    email address here I'd be glad to do it. You could then contact me with yours
    since one address I have exists specifically for public disclosure and occasional
    hazards that go with it.
