  drive. Luckily, I had generated an .otf file of the most recent version. Do I lose
  anything when I open up the .otf file in Fontlab and save it as a .vfb?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    begin with, and maybe some OpenType code won\u2019t decompile the same, but those
    can be imported from older VFBs easily enough."
