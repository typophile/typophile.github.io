body: "Greetings fellow typophiles!\r\n\r\nI'm a pretty new member here, and not sure
  if this has been addressed before. I did a search before and nothing came up, so
  here goes.\r\n\r\nI was just wondering if anyone had any knowledge of why large
  foundries such as Veer and FontFont charge different prices for typefaces depending
  on what country you live in.\r\n\r\nI've purchased alot of type in my time when
  I lived in the states, and this was never an issue. However I recently relocated
  to Australia and recently encountered this curious situation. It hasn't been an
  issue with independent foundries that have flat prices, but with the bigger houses,
  its another story.\r\n\r\nTake Veer for example. I spec'd some typefaces for a job
  and went to the veer site to get the price which came up as 50.00 USD. I put the
  cost on the estimate to a client which gets signed off, and when it comes time to
  actually buy the typeface, I register with the site with my new Australian details,
  and the same typeface comes up as 50 Euro.\r\n\r\nI emailed Veer about it, and this
  was the response I got:\r\n\r\n\"When you are not a registered user, you will be
  on the North American\r\nwebsite and therefore see the North American prices in
  USD. Previously\r\nall transactions were based on USD but with a recent change in
  our\r\norganization we started our operation in Europe/Asia/Australia. With\r\nthis
  start-up we also changed the website and introduced different\r\ncurrencies.\r\n\r\nThis
  expansion means that we have started our business officially in\r\nEurope/Australia
  with a Sales and Service Center in Berlin, Germany. In\r\nthe future customers in
  Europe as well as Australia will be supported by\r\nthe team in Berlin. This also
  means that territories supported by our\r\nEuropean call center will see the transactions
  in Euro. The currency and\r\nthe support is linked to the billing address. The prices
  are different\r\nin several countries and adjusted to reflect the competition and
  the\r\nprice structure in Europe and also Australia.\"\r\n\r\nThe thing is, that
  the population of the entire country of Australia is about that of Manhattan alone.
  Budgets here are much, much, much smaller than North America. For one typeface,
  its not a big deal I know, but when you look at a collection, take Umbrella Type
  for instance which is around 5,000 USD for a US resident, is now 5,000 Euro for
  a European or Australian resident. A difference of thousands of dollars. No client
  here would ever sign off on that.\r\n\r\nFontshop also has differences in pricing,
  but at least its not just switching the currency sign, and the conversions come
  out a bit closer.\r\n\r\nI am a passionate supporter of Veer and all their wonderful
  stuff. I love nothing more than buying type when I can, especially single faces
  for personal projects and experimentation. A practice like this just seems unsustainable
  to the community, and a bit annoying as well, as I have to get my family back in
  the states to buy type for me :)\r\n\r\nI just wondered if anyone else had any thoughts
  on this. Am I just over reacting? Is it another case of a designer who has no grasp
  of basic economics? This just seems like a curious practice to me, essentially for
  something digital that has no extra costs associated with it (like shipping, etc).
  I'd love to hear anyones opinions or experiences! :)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    from 45 Euro (79 US $) at FontShop Austria down to 29 US $ at MyFonts; Font Shop
    International does not allow me to buy - does not even show the price - and refers
    me to FontShop Berlin which charges 39 Euro, Linotype wants 34 Euro. Go figure!"

    The Standard of Living varies so widely from nation to nation, it makes sense
    to price accordingly based on region.\r\n\r\nThis is true of most software companies
    and other 'virtual' products. Not to mention a variety of physical products as
    well. You can buy MS Office in the US for maybe $150 and in some countries, it'll
    cost you $5.\r\n\r\nPurchasing products out of country is typically called the
    'grey market'. Not necessarily illegal, but usually voids things like warranties
    and EULAs.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I followed up with some feedback to Veer, who has been very gracious in trying
    to provide good service. I'll post it here in case anyone is interested. \r\n\r\n\"Thank
    you for your reply. \r\n\r\nI can understand that it not as obvious that prices
    are adjusted for\r\ndifferent markets if it is \"only \" a digital file. Without
    going into\r\ntoo much detail I would just like you to consider that it would
    be the\r\nsame with almost every product. In our case we have basically followed\r\nindustry
    standard and if you compare the prices you will find that we\r\nare in the middlefield.
    Another thing to consider is also that with\r\nopening an operation and production
    in Europe we have other costs as\r\nwell which are reflected in the prices in
    Europe as well.\r\n\r\nNow pricing is a very complex subject for which a lot of
    other factors\r\nare important that I will not be able to discuss and reveal which
    you\r\ncan certainly understand. \r\n\r\nHowever we do value feedback like this
    and I will pass this on to our\r\nProduct Management team for consideration. It
    is important for us to\r\nhear what our customers have to say and we would not
    just disregard this\r\n(even though I will not be able to change the price for
    you!). \r\n\r\nWith regards purchasing from a North American account: as long
    as you\r\nhave a billing address in the US, you will be able to do this.\"\r\n\r\nI've
    had a read of the other threads that have been pointed out here, thanks very much
    for that. Some very interesting debates on the subject however I still feel that
    this is an unfair practice. Oh well. The world's not fair I guess, or I was just
    too spoiled from my North American upbringing. Thanks for everyones feedback though!"

  body: "<cite>Is it another case of a designer who has no grasp of basic economics?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell,
    yes. No product has a \"universal value\". Prices may only \"suggest\" a certain
    value. But the perfect price is based on supply and demand. And the demand is
    different is every nation. When a European customer is willing to pay 200% of
    the price in the U.S., then he probably also earns 200% for his job, compared
    to a designer in the U.S.\r\nWhen the font vendor would try to raise the prices
    to 200% everywhere, they would loose their U.S. customers. When they keep it to
    100% everywhere, they loose money, because the European customer is willing to
    pay more. So it's perfectly normal charge different prices in every nation."

  body: If a business actually operates in more than one country (as opposed to selling
    internationally from one country), they may be required by law to list prices
    in the local currency. Unless they want to keep changing prices every day, the
    different local prices are going to get out of sync due to exchange rate fluctuations.
    A lot of prices treat the euro as roughly equivalent to the dollar, which was
    true some years ago - it isn't true now, but why change if Europeans are still
    willing to pay? It's not so much that European prices are high as that American
    prices have, in effect, sunk recently.

  body: "><em>How do taxes play into this equation? Would say a VAT increase the retail
    price of a font bought in Euros or from a European country?</em>\r\n\r\nI think
    so! If you buy a font from a European website, they will include the VAT in the
    amount they charge you. I think that, if you are not a European, you can get your
    VAT back, but not from the company you bought from, but rather from the country
    in which that company operates. I have never tried this myself, however.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    you may be able to call up the company, and prove somehow that you don't have
    to pay VAT. They they could sell you the font VAT free offline I guess. But I'm
    not a tax specialist! Anyway, I think that the onus is on the buyer to prove he
    doesn't have to pay VAT tax. Europeans selling goods have to collect the VAT tax
    and pass it on to their governments.\r\n\r\nVAT can be like 20%, too. It varies
    from country to country. IIRC, the price difference between Apple computers sold
    in the US and Germany for a time was pretty much just the different between with
    VAT and without. For Americans who live in states with low (or no) sales taxes,
    VAT may be difficult to understand. Different countries operate under different
    systems. If you shop from a company in a different country, you have to accept
    the way that their system operates, not expect them to change their business to
    operate the way that you are used to (this would be illegal for them anyway\u2026)."

    shows the prices without VAT, because their B2B customers don't care about the
