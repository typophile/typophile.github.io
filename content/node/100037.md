    Lobster 1.4 \xA92010 and Lobster Two \xA92011 Bold Italic. Two does have 4910
    kerning pairs (vs 84). And why is Two not available at your site?"

  body: "Thanks Steve.\r\nLobster2 was ikerned, and it also has a few minor tweaks
    here and there...\r\nIt's not yet available at my site, basically, because I've
    been quite busy making lots of other projects (http://www.impallari.com/projects)
    and have yet to update the specimens/download pages for many of the those fonts.
    \r\nIf you look at the footer of my site, you will see a lot of fonts that are
    already available, but does not have a link to the detailed page yet... Maybe
    in the next months I will grab some extra time to update those pages, but first
    I have to finish Encode and Libre Caslon."
