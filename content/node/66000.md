  & Kulturista]] from Suitcase Type for a design that I am working on, but unfortunately
  neither supports Tabular Figures and they are not planned in the future either.\r\n\r\nSo,
  as the printed material will contain a large number of  spreadsheets, I am looking
  for suitable replacements for Nudista & Kulturista with Tabular Figures.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSeb "

    too close to Kulturista."

    indeed.\r\n\r\nWhat I like in Kulturista is the seamless fit with Nudista, much
    like Morgan Sans & Morgan Avec which I am now also considering."
