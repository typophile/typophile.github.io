  \ I am having a very difficult time finding a font to use in the body of our communications.
  \ I have attached a PDF of the logo and an example of the letterhead.  Any help
  would be great. Also, if anyone has any suggesions for the logo type and/or changes
  that would tie it in better with a body font please let me know.     \r\n\r\nThanks
  in adavance. \r\n\r\nJesse"

  body: I would look at a serif typeface to contrast with the sans serif type of your
    CI. Times could even work. Depending on the size of your company you might want
    to use a universally accessible typeface anyone can use.

  body: Thanks for the feedback.  I agree that it may be a good idea to contrast the
    CI with a serif typeface.  Does anyone else have any font recommendations, serif
    or not,  for the body?
