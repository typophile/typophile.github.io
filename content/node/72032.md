  body: "Thank you, Renko!\r\n\r\nIt looks like it's a match! You're such a life saver.
    It looks as though it comes in 3 weights and is, as the ultimate bonus, FREE.\r\n\r\nFor
    the work I need to do, this condensed version is perfect. Curious if someone might
    know of a non-condensed version of this font somewhere as well. I've seen a company
    logo that uses this font in its non-condensed form as well.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen-shot-2010-07-07-at-3_6663.49.41-PM.jpg]"
