body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for information about the typeface \"Walter\",
  distributed by Brendel & Pabst in the sixties / seventies. I just have a specimen
  in the Hollenstein foundry 1972 catalog (a french foundry and font distributor),
  but nothing about its designer, and I couldnt get any information about the foundry
  as well (Brendel & Pabst), apart from a credit to the font Romana, and something
  obscure about font forgeries in the 90's.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone out there have any
  information about this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\ndr\r\n\r\nps: I will post a scan of this
  font tomorrow, for I dont have the sample with me right now."

    far as I recall B&P Graphics were one ot those shady outfits that recycled other

  body: "I have a CD, specimen book, and poster of \"The Serials Collection\" of B
    & P types. This was sent to me at the agency where I worked in about 1993 by B
    & P Graphics in LaGrange, Illinois. It is full of \"fresh recuts\" of well-known
    faces. Neither \"Walter\" nor \"Romana\" is among them. We never put any of these
    faces into use.\r\n\r\n\"Walter,\" I reckon, denotes Walter Florenz Brendel, the
    man behind the the work (&, I imagine, the \"B\" in B & P).\r\n\r\nBut indeed,
    a scan of the face will help.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: The font shown by David R in his above scan seems to be either a variation
    (or a forgery) of an old photocomposition font called "Eton" depicted in Stiebner,
    Alphabets 2, Munich 1990, page 111.
