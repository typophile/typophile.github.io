body: "Hey Everybody!\r\n\r\nWondering if anyone has some ideas for a supporting Body
  Typeface for our Logo?\r\nWe commisioned the logo; the designer using his typeface
  'Foret'. We are searching everwhere (well you know what I mean) looking for a typeface
  that will compliment this. The typeface would need to be a solid performer and work
  well in general buisness documents etc. Perferably with at least a simple set. Im
  thinking something quite simple a Sans Serif with a slight twist...\r\nI think a
  Sans Serif will be a nice contrast to the logo...\r\n\r\nSo far it's been a struggle
  to find something as we are a little close to the subject. (as it's our precious
  brand).\r\n\r\nAll ideas welcome!\r\n\r\nSome types we have liked so far:\r\n\r\n\u2022
  \ DIN fonts (fishmonger)\r\n\u2022  T-Star (by Mika Mischler, but un avaliable to
  purchase as far as we can tell).\r\n\u2022  Akkurat (but as it's similar to Helvetica,
  not keen for a body typeface).\r\n\u2022  Solex (but not sure as this is a serif)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    body: "Hey Belleisle,\r\n\r\nThe designer suggested the Akkurt and FF Balance.
      I wasn't a big fan of the ff Balance\r\nas I found it a little curvy.\r\n\r\n"

    Sans</a>.

  body: "Hey Jon & Terminal,\r\n\r\nSo do you think the logo is crap? Please eloborate...\r\nI
    passed the logo onto another designer overseas to offer some distance as we were
    finding it difficult in house to come up with a solution for our business. At
    the time I liked it, but lately I've felt it could be a little 'weak' or fluffy.
    (also trying to find type solutions that work with, as I more of a contemporary
    DIN, Helvetica fan).\r\n\r\nIf you could please express your opinions; as I'd
    appreciate the feedback. (as it's a major deal for us this re brand).\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Where to start? \r\n\r\nThe terminals on the c, r, e, s, and a are lumpy
    and do not transition into the hairline in an elegant way.\r\n\r\nThe tops and
    bottoms of all the letters have that tell-tail sharp transition at the tangent
    point. Very abrupt and not attractive.\r\n\r\nAll the curves are sloppy, not a
    taught curve in the bunch. The r is too wide, the lower bowl of the a looks like
    it was drawn by an alzheimer's patient, the t is weak and that te ligature does
    not work at all.\r\n\r\nThe spacing is poor and there is absolutely no rhythm
    anywhere.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "Hi James-\r\n\r\nHa ha!\r\nThanks for the feedback- so basically you think
    ditch the logo? \r\nLooking at those points Im thinking the fundamentals of the
    typeface design Foret are poor to begin with...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zuckerundpfeffer.com/Projects/2005/Foret/"
