  area of perceptual illusions is very interesting in font design.\r\n\r\nBy perceptual
  illusions I mean the phenomenon such as the letter \u201CO\u201D looking smaller
  vertically than the other characters in the set even though mathematically it may
  be the same height.  So to correct this we increase the vertical size of the overall
  character from the top and bottom.  But by how much.\r\n\r\nI have contacted an
  academic professor who specialises in perceptual illusions and he has said that
  for any pure perceptual illusion the only way to make corrections is by perceptual
  judgment.  In other words there is no mathematical formula which can be used to
  correct the illusion unless statistical experiments are conducted and conclusions/judgements
  are formed using statistics.\r\n\r\nFont designers come across this all the time
  and make judgements to correct these illusions.  But even through there may not
  be an mathematical formula has anyone got any general rules which are used when
  these corrections are made.  Including how to spot potential illusions such as sharp
  points such as the sharp bottom point on \u201CV\u201D may look smaller than other
  characters if vertical size is the same."
