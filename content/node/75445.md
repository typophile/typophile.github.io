    of dummy text in foundry specimens.\r\nAlastair Johnston's <em>Alphabets to Order</em>
    is a brilliant study of the dada poetry of 19th century American specimen books.\r\nFont
    Bureau and Hoefler & Frere-Jones have been instrumental in maintaining this tradition
    -- part of which is the anonymity of the authors, which strikes me as a shame,

    Eric Shinn, utilizing various software tools.\r\n\r\n"

    referred to time, even though as a period of time, it was still misused as a unit
    of time.
