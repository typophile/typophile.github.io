  the trailer, they use another font. The word Rise has a specific R. Can anyone help
  id-ing this font?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot."

    services</a>  I really like your way of expressing the opinions and sharing the
    information. <a href="http://www.recruitmentagenciesinpakistan.com/">Services
    for recruitment</a>  It is good to move as chance bring new things in life, paves
    the way for advancement, etc. But it is well known to everyone that moving to
    new location with bulk of goods is not an easy task to move or shift from one
    place to other place because I have experienced about that and I face the problem
    like that.  <a href="http://www.recruitmentagenciesinpakistan.com/">Employment
    services</a> There I go to village near to my city faced that problem there.
