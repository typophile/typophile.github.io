body: Does anyone know why a TrueType font wouldn&#39;t be working in Flash or Dreamweaver?
  It works in InDesign, Photoshop, etc. The name of the font is there, but when I
  select the text &amp; font name, the text goes blank.  <BR>I created the font in
  FontLab.   <BR>Other fonts I&#39;ve created are working just fine in these recently
  acquired Abode software products... <BR> <BR>very strange... <BR>any thoughts are
  appreciated... <BR> <BR>thanks! <BR>amy

  body: You probably need to clear your font caches. You can do it with a Utility
    like <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/mdouma46/fontfinagler/" target="_blank">Font
    Finagler</a>. This is pretty much required if you want to develope and test fonts
    on OS X anyway. Changing the font name during testing each time you make a new
    version &#40;the font name, not the file name&#41; can help, too.
