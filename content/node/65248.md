body: "I'm using the FDK 2.5 to generate some fonts with and I noticed that the OpenType
  features in these fonts do not work in InDesign CS2 (and CS as well). I'm suspecting
  that this has to do with the required \"languagesystem DFLT dflt;\" statement in
  the new FDK. However, in CS3 and CS4 the features work just fine.\r\n\r\nMy features
  don't use any language or script tags (the fonts contain latin glyphs only). I've
  also tested what happens when I add 'script DFLT; language dftl;' to all the features
  but this is to no avail as well.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a clue how to make CS2
  recognise features with the FDK 2.5 syntax?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\n-Paul"
