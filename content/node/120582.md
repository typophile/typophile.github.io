  body: This is a puzzle - nothing seems to match the funny serif bumps on the A t
    and l - more info like time period, source etc. might help us narrow the field
    - it is an interesting font.

  body: "The boxy small serifs are somewhat similar to Cushing Two Book [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CushingTwoBookAsAustralia_6024.gif]
    or Cushing Two Demi [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CushingTwoDemiAsAustralia_5866.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/cushing-two/\r\nConsider also Bushing Thin
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BushingthinAsAustralia_3668.gif] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/bushing/
    which has an _a_ closer to _Australia_.\r\nYou might consider pasting Cushing
    Two serifs on a light weight low contrast font with letter-forms close to _Australia_.\r\nDon"

  body: Thank you so much for the help Don. I think these set of "Cushing" fonts are
    the closest. I have also deleted the duplicate of this entry. Sorry for the trouble.
    Thanks again :) Thanks to Ricard0 and bojev as well. I didn't really have any
    more info about this. When I asked my client about the font, she doesn't know
    either and said she will try to contact the first one who did the logo.
