  body: While laying out my college newspaper, tracking body text in and out by visible
    amounts ... and, horrifyingly enough, horizontally scaling the type by several
    percentage points. If we had something designed for that, like something by Unger,
    I'd feel better, but this is Miller -- it's too pretty to be treated like this
    :-(

  body: Like many hate/like threads, this is a pretty subjective topic... Not too
    different from favorite songs. One person's guilty pleasure is another person's
    best song of all time...  :-)

  body: Sheesh, what a bunch of puritans! Those are the typographic equivalents of
    getting excited at the sight of the gap between a woman's glove and sleeve. You
    want guilty pleasures? Print out ITC Souvenir at 500pt on big sheets of paper
    and then roll around on them naked.
