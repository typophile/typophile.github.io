  \ Sorry in advance to anyone who sees this post in the critique section.\r\n\r\nHow\u2019s
  it going everybody? I am Graphic Design student studying abroad in Stockholm. I
  am currently trying to research Swedish typography, but have run into a bit of a
  road block. I am curious if there is anyone out there who can give me names of great
  Swedish typographers? I am very interested in the old-style ornamental typography,
  but would love to hear of any great typographers or typesetters.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  know of any books that document Swedish typography? I read in a past post (was from
  2005) that there was a beautiful illustrated book of Swedish typography. Does anyone
  know the name of this book, or any other books that I might be able to take a look
  at. For my purposes I am more interested in looking at previous examples rather
  than a how to book, but would appreciate any response.\r\n\r\nThanks much, and I
  hope to hear back from you guys soon.\r\n"

  body: "I have definitely tried the google search.  I found a few links, but no matter
    how far I looked, I couldn't find any  good books or quality images.  I have a
    few names, but was curious if anyone knew the masters of Swedish Typography.  \r\n\r\nAnders
    Bodebeck, Bo Berndal, Franko Luin, Lutz Baar, Lars Berquist, Karl-Erik Forsberg,
    Waldemar Zachrisson.  \r\n\r\nI have found all these names, but can only seem
    to find typefaces for sale by them.   While it is great to see some of the fonts
    they have designed, I would really like to see some of their work.\r\n\r\nIdeally
    I would like to find a book documenting the history of Swedish typography, but
    haven't found one.  I also get lost once the websites switch to Swedish.  I have
    only been here in Stockholm for a few weeks, so I don't speak the language yet."

    designers or type designers you are seeking information about?\r\n\r\nI know a
    few people who has great knowledge in both matters. Maybe one of them might even
    answer right here in this thread?\r\n\r\nG\xF6ran"

    give some advise but won't do it all here. Please get my contact info on my web
    site and give me a call when you have time. Please also contact a wonderful second

    owner Glenn is a very nice fellow. Over the years he have specialised in Typography
    books, specimens etc. http://www.svaf.se/morris/index_eng.htm\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Goran-\r\n\r\nThanks for responding.  While i am interested in learning about
    both, I am more interested in the artwork created with Swedish typography.  i.e.
    posters, signs, books, etc.  I really enjoy the ornamental style fonts that I
    have seen in old Scandanavian artwork.  \r\n\r\nLearning about the people who
    actually design different typefaces would also be great, but I am hoping to find
    examples of Swedish typography used in artwork.\r\n\r\nStefan-\r\n\r\nThanks for
    responding.  I will check out your website and will get into contact with you
    in the next few days.  I will also check out \"Antikvariat Morris\" and hopefully
    I will be able to find something.  My only mode of transportation is the tunnelbana
    or by bus, so I will have to research more about the store, and hopefully find
    a way down there.\r\n\r\nThanks again.  \r\n- Lucas"

    books, I also suggest you do searches for Bodebeck, Forsberg, Zachrisson on abebooks.com,
    as they can find books all over the world relating to books, typography, and type,
    and the people behind them. "
