For one thing, it can only apply to text fonts. And even in the realm of text fonts, I would distinguish between a reader going &quot;Oh, what a cool font!&quot; (which you certainly don't want) versus a reader feeling a subconscious tingle of excitement at encountering something new, something that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->amplifies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the content in the subtlest way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No font is ever totally transparent, basically because that's not possible of something that's made by a human for other humans. The difference between text and display, between craft versus art, however is the intent of the maker: creating something useful that contains a part of him &quot;naturally&quot; almost of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in spite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of himself; or formally celebrating his personal expression. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

When a typeface is designed to fill a certain need/want (say, a new typeface for the Munich Underground, or a printing firm's annual report, or a newspaper who wants to print their stock listings in smaller type) then we can be sure that there really is an audience, or use, for a design.

		<div class="commentbody">I guess that was a loaded response. But the original statement has that slippery little word 'successful.' Coupled with the vague 'fount,' we have a tricky proposition that raised two questions: &quot;what is a fount?&quot; and &quot;what is successful?&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I answered based on the liquid nature of the original statement. It does sound great and romantic, you are absolutely right. I can't answer for others, but I can answer for me. A thing well made makes me very happy indeed, even happier when I have made it myself. A thing well made fulfils both form &amp; function, and thus those who use it wil be happy too. (How very karmic!). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Dan said, unless one is lucky enough to have the appropriate tools for gauging &quot;how well their fonts would satisfy the needs/wants of the graphic design community&quot; then it is back to the bubble! They can be as happy as Larry with a typeface I have made, but if I am not happy with it then there is something amiss.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am in no way denying the fact that typefaces are tools to be used by our brothers and sisters in design. Sometimes they don't use our tools very well at all, sometimes very badly indeed. When this happens then there is only one thing that makes the whole thing worthwhile: &quot;am I happy with my new fount?&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kris.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">By defining a good type designer in relation to a certain kind of print genre (traditional, book, text), Morison put the cart before the horse. He had an agenda, of course, which was to promote an upper-crust notion of typography, with himself as the uber-guru. The Type Czar. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, then (1927) as now, there was also a market for novel commercial founts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For instance, at that time, Morris Benton took a style of &quot;Moderne&quot; display lettering used in signage, and turned it into a typeface&ndash;Broadway&ndash;which was quite patently a typeface of great novelty, to all and sundry. Benton is undisputedly a good type designer, and Broadway, if for no other reason than having stood the test of time, is a good typeface. Ergo Morison was wrong.</div>

Immanuel Kant, for instance. Luther's works were all published during his lifetime in blackletter, exclusively, I think. In fact it was this decision that made Fraktur the quasi-official style of the German language for 400 years. Luther's Bible (i.e., the official Bible of the German Lutheran Church) was printed solely with Fraktur until the 1960s.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To concur with Tiffany, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, first humanists tried to found appropriate letter style to fit new thinking around, those from greek philosophers. As they found manuscripts in Libraries, wrote in sort of carolingian/oncials, they imagined, by mistake that the greeks used that kind of writing style. So, they followed and in fact, it gave to us, hopefully, what we call humanistic handwriting. Then, later, first printers, followed that and draw first &quot;Romans&quot; and italics. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Couple of years after, when the center of printing was moved to France, it happen roughly same thing. Just to recall you that at the time, Fraktur type was more common in France. But because of new thinking around, again, mostly critical essays about bible and religion, who bring soon after Luther (and many printers on fire), the printers and punchcutters wanted to use letterforms who reflect their openness on new ideas around, so, people like Augereau and Garamond cut new type, to fit better to the text.</div>
