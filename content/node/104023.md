  body: When this is hopeless, you need to go back to roots, essentials. May be you
    could try various weights and styles of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica|Helvetica]].
    Extra Compressed for your first sample and Condensed Black for the digits...

  body: Well, I didn't realize this search was hopeless! Because it implies you experts
    don't think this font exists. Thanks for your advice. I'll research.

  body: "I guess my pathetic try to be humouristic was nothing but a fail :)\r\nAnyway,
    I dig a bit more and [[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=summit+racing+pdf|found
    some PDF]]. Guess what? It reveals they're massively using... Helvetica Condensed
    Bold/Black and Nimbus Sans Condensed Black which is considered as URW++ version
    of... Helvetica."
