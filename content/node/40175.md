  fonts like Data 70</a>, I came across this interesting interview between <a href=\"http://www.elupton.com/index.php?id=22\">Ellen
  Lupton and Jonathan Hoefler</a>. In it, Hoefler mentions a typeface Barry Deck created
  for Nickelodeon called \"Fontoid.\" \r\n\r\nTry as I might, I haven't been able
  to find a sample of this anywhere, and I'd very much like to compare it with the
  other faces I'm looking at.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a sample or know where I can
  find one?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    on <a href=\"http://www.barrydeck.com/index.html\">his website</a>, but you could
    try to contact him.\r\n\r\nLuc Devroye mentions Fontoid on <a href=\"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/commercialfonts2.html\">his
    site</a>, and says that Barry Deck sells it, but there are no links.\r\n\r\nOther
    than Emigre and Village, I don't know if any other foundries distribute his work."

  body: I've sent an email inquiry to the contact address on barrydeck.com. The site
    doesn't look like it's been updated in a while, so I'll have to hope I get a response.

    give a monkey's, but it might as well read: \"yes i've sold out, please use my

  body: "Hi zachwhalen.\r\nI have Fontoid, and some other old faces by Barry.\r\nI
    could try to make you a protected PDF; but I'm not sure if Barry would agree about
    that,.\r\n\r\nI have not been in touch with him for a long time, so maybe (alternatively),
    we could try to contact him, or \u2014 if it's the same thing to you \u2013 I
    could arrange a low-res bitmap image.\r\nI don't know, however, if this could
    prove useful for your research, since Fontoid is pretty distant from the geometry
    found in Data70 et al."
