True, a near-sans.

How about Symbol? Benguiat Gothic?
Not really pure sans either.

Not a lot. The action was serific.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi everyone,

I third Insignia!  ;-D

And I'd have to nominate Futura Condensed as a very '80s sans serif.  Yeah, I know it's been around and in use a long time, but it seemed to me that it was EVERYWHERE during the Me Decade.

Avant Garde was still getting a lot of use, but to me that's a quintessentially '70s sans serif.

Helvetica was everywhere too, but to me that doesn't exactly count because to most people back then, it was a "default" "block style" font.  Heck, until the Mac made its debut in 1984 I had never heard of the word "font" except in the baptismal sense!  ;-)

		<div class="commentbody">"Brody rapidly constructed the typeface later named Industria, and debuted it throughout The Face in July. What a leap, and so rare: an art director designing a typeface for his own magazine."

Actually Industria seems to be based closely on some student work from the first half of the 20th century, specifically from the Stuttgart School of Decorative Art. See page 105 of "130 Alphabets & Other Signs" by J Rothenstein & M Gooding.

This is Dutch, anon., c.1935.

Also caps, Morris Benton's <a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?sku=GT002661">Raleigh Condensed.</a>

Perhaps there is some influence of Soviet constructivism, e.g. Rodchenko's "CPAZY" poster lettering:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/149_4607.jpg]
BTW, isn't that logo for GUM neat? The same idea is currently appearing as section heads in Wired!

But really, I doubt Neville directly referenced earlier sources. Look at your own experience with bitmaps, Hrant, there's not much room to move within strict constraints.

**

Industria wasn't available as a font until 1990, and there was nothing else like it available during the 80s, so can it be considered typical, even though it is iconic?

True, but there's a "genetic" difference between a constraint coming from a medium (lo-res screen) versus a constraint that somebody dreams up: unlike the former, the latter can possibly been inspired by another designer's work. As in "Oh, that looks like an interesting constraint - let me see what I can do with that". Unlike in bitmap fonts, Industria had no "inherited" constraints. That said, I do agree that Industria could very well be "original".
