  and I have formed a graphic design company right here in New Zealand, called The
  Letterheads. (We are aware of the existence of <a href=\"http://www.letterhead.com/\">these
  people</a>, and even enquired about the purchase of the domain name. However, US
  $20,000 is a bit too much)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theletterheads.co.nz/\">So
  here is our website</a>. We would be very appreciative of your criticism!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKa
  kite.\r\nKris."

  body: 'Refreshing and inviting. But I do have a concern about about the focus of
    the site. If your purpose is to advertise your graphic design, not your (wonderful)
    type, then the designs rather than your type should be more up front. Currently
    your portfolio of graphic design work is two layers deep in a drop down box that
    isn''t even labeled ''portfolio''. I think the portfolio would be better moved
    up in the visual and information design hierarchy. '

  body: "Wow, thanks guys! We are tuly appreciative of your comments. I would get
    an rss feed up and running, but I don't really know how nor do I have that much
    \ to say. I struggle enough with the darn css to get the rss going! \r\n\r\nThanks
    for the structural insight, William. There has been mention of one other user
    who missed it entirely, which is a glaringly obvious mistake in our design. Hopefully
    it will be rectified soon.\r\n"
