body: "Sadly, after nearly 5 years loyal service, mine passed away last weekend.\r\n\r\nI
  took it to the not so local repair shop and the technician said that they were getting
  more and more G5's with failing cpu's. The repair would have been \xA3700!. So I
  thought it wasn't worth repairing as it would be obsolete very soon (as it doesn't
  support Snow Leopard), and it's over a third of the cost of a new Mac Pro, (which
  I duly coughed up for). \r\n\r\nNow I'm not one who goes in for conspiracy theories
  of built-in death chips, but it does make me wonder..."

    of the normal resuscitation techniques were working.\r\n\r\nAppleCare sent a technician
    to the studio. They checked the RAM, and Hard Drives, and replaced the Motherboard.
    No luck. A second technician came a day later and replaced the video card and
    everything was hunky-dorey. This second tech told me that he had seen a rash of
    video card failures that were causing these Kernel Panics."

    hasn't been much trouble (Knocking wood!). Hope its not an epidemic."

  body: "Yes Bert, Those G5's are liquid cooled. Coolant evaporation over the years
    is the main reason for cpu failure (according to the Mac technician). Wow Jan
    - 8 or 9 years is good going!\r\n\r\nI've never heard of Kernel Panic - good name
    for a group.\r\n\r\nI was a bit wary about getting a new MacPro what with the
    incompatibility issues with FontLab and Snow Leopard, but I managed to get one
    with Leopard installed and an upgrade to Snow Leopard when I eventually feel brave
    enough to install it.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "One strange interesting thing: I had everything from the G5 backed up on
    an external hard drive via Time Machine, and reinstalled from that to the new
    MacPro. All settings and applications as before. Great, I thought. \r\n\r\nIn
    the few days between the G5's demise and getting the new MacPro I was working
    on my laptop on two FontLab files. With the MacPro up and running I copied the
    FL files from the laptop via AirPort. I then worked on these 2 files all yesterday,
    saved and quit. When I opened them this morning they were unchanged from the modified
    date on the laptop - nothing had been saved, all yesterday's work gone. I then
    modified them a bit then quit and reopened them - nothing saved.\r\n\r\nSo I went
    to the laptop and copied them onto a Flash Drive and replaced them on the MacPro.
    I then modified them a bit then quit and reopened them - the modifications were
    saved this time. Modifications to other files copied from Time Machine were also
    fine - just not files copied via AirPort. Weird.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
