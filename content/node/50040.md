body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AmericanEmblem_3788.jpg]\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  know the name of this typeface?  It has an interesting combination of both official
  looking strong letterforms as well as a few whimsical curlicues.  This typeface
  will be used for the company branding of a Horsedrawn carriage company operating
  in a midwest river town celebrating their bicentennial.  I need to find something
  that is classy and historic, and horsey- Main Street America... but not mistaken
  for wild west or circus.  \r\n\r\nOpen to alternative suggestions!"

  body: Great news. The EULA has changed a bit. They  now allow embedding in PDFs
    for starters.

    of a font like this so I can purchase it.  Did I do something wrong with how I
    attached this jpg?

  body: No. We both had knee-jerk reactions. :^) Visit Letterhead Fonts, there must
    be something similar in their collection.
