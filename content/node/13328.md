  regarding the fonts that he used when he initially developed the website.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  care to lend me a hand and try to identify the font that was used in <a href=\"http://www.bearslax.com/images/system/cla_logo_large.gif\">this</a>
  logo?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance - I really appreciate your help...\r\n\r\n- Al Liebowitz"

      and the link I posted above directly to the graphic work here.\r\n\r\nI'll call
      around and see if others are having problems.  What error are you getting?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "That was a good suggestion Dav, but the closest font there was <a href=\"http://www.iconian.com/g.html\"
    target=\"new\">Gunship</a>, and it wasn't  the same in many ways. \r\n\r\n<em>(I've
    also checked MyFonts 'Techno' & 'Futuristic' styles. Also looked at parts of DaFont's
    Techno styles. I suggested Typophile to Al, because I was getting nowhere, and
    thought someone here might recognize the font(s) used. I think the angled A might
    be a customization to make this more logo-ish, since it's an easy three straight
    lines to make.)</em>\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
