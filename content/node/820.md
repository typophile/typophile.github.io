  body: Thank you all! <BR> <BR>Eras was my first guess at a design root for this
    face, but the similarities are merely aesthetic. <BR> <BR>The postmaster font
    is a bit, uh... sloppy, and the weights are off, but it&#39;ll do for my purposes.
    <BR> <BR>And by the word &#34;jobbie&#34; I mean that it was more than a one off,
    since it is used for the entire identity system for the USPS redesign. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    again!
