  as a favor and I'm not sure what typeface this is. I also don't want to have to
  take the time to pen tool it if I don't have to.\r\n\r\nIf possible, I'd like a
  starting point for \"Sand Gnats.\" I've exhausted my font collection as well as
  a free site or two's script inventories with no luck.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sportslogos.net/logo.php?id=rkv0i6rlqgd2pxmhlsd62eu41"
