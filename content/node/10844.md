body: Greetings everyone... <BR> <BR>I hope this is the right forum to be posting
  this on. I dont have a particular font that needs identification, but thought I
  would pick some of your brains to lead me down the right patch.  <BR> <BR>If this
  is in the wrong forum, I apologise, and will repost to the appropriate forum. <BR>
  <BR>I am doing research for a &#40;student&#41; project where I would like to riff
  off some old postcard design. I have attached a few examples of what I feel to be
  the typographic direction I would like to go in. <BR> <BR>I am aware that the main
  typefaces used here were most likely hand drawn or photo-type, but was wondering
  if anyone could reccommend any fonts with similar proportions or forms. <BR> <BR>I
  also wouldnt be surprised if there were a few websites offering galleries, or perhaps
  hi-res scans of some of these designs... does anyone know of anything in this vein?
  <BR> <BR>In terms of acheiving the dimension of the text. I was wondering if any
  of you had suggestions or a particular method that you use. I have been using  KPT
  Vector tools in Illustrator to achieve the dimension, and then using Pshop to get
  the curvature, but have not been very pleased with the results. <BR> <BR>My final
  question which is more type id related, is also  in relation to the postcards. In
  attempting to recreate this style, i am seeking some distressed typefaces that still
  maintain some semblance of typographic dignity... any foundries come to mind? Distressed
  i mean in the terms of looking like the ink has bled, or just general wear. Has
  a distressed version of Futura or similar fonts used during that era been released?   <BR>
  <BR>Perhaps some of you could share information on technique?  I think it might
  have been here, there was a thread that linked to a silkscreen site that contained
  graphics to lay over text in illustrator to acheive this effect. Are there any other
  places on the net to find these types of graphics?  <BR> <BR>Thank you in advance
  for anyone who takes the time to read and respond to my post.  <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Handsome

    updated vibe you could use that. as for  <BR>distressed futura, i don&#39;t know,
    but i&#39;ve seen plenty  <BR>of messed up bodonis. let me think a minute. <BR>

    But I don&#39;t think it will help you with what you&#39;re after. <BR> <BR>The
    word &#34;Denton&#34; in your third example is set in Balloon. The script above
    it and the script in the first example may be set from type. But the rest is probably
    all hand-lettering. <BR> <BR>If this is a learning project, then you might just
    consider turning off the computer and trying your hand at drawing letters like
    these. You&#39;ll learn a lot that way. Try a library or used book store for some
    old books on hand-lettering -- sign-painting or advertising. <BR> <BR>-- Kent.

  body: Kent- <BR> <BR>Thanks for your note! I was actually considering a career in
    signwriting... here in Australia you can actually get a degree in it, and it takes
    awhile, and you have to apprentice and everything. The market is a bit flooded
    though, and the biggest problem is really my handwriting. I just cant draw a straight
    line!  <BR> <BR>Either way, could you possible reccommend a decent book to check
    out? I have some old speedball manuals, but i didnt find them clear. <BR> <BR>As
    for font ID&#39;s, my current infatuation is with <a href="http://www.vintagelabels.org"
    target="_blank">www.vintagelabels.org</a>. Can anyone ID the main sans-serif that
    they use on their page. Im particularly interested in the faces used on the oceanliner
    pages. The geometric sans&#39; towards the back are particularly appealing. They
    remind me a little of the new hoefler faces, but as a student now, its out of
    the financial picture. Any other suggestions? Thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>

  body: the serif that says vintage travel is bodoni or something like it. <BR>the
    sans to the left &#40;image gallery home, new, hotels, airlines,  <BR>etc&#41;
    is gill sans.

    in this vein? </i> <BR> <BR>Here is a gem of a site &#40;actually better to use
    their  java application&#41; that has wildly high resolution old world maps and
    geography releted items all the way back to 1500&#39;s. I&#39;ve literally wasted
    days drooling over the type on these maps. For your purposes, there are old train
    schedules from the 1800 - 1900&#39;s that have just that <i>Peoria, Texas, and
    Washington </i> type you&#39;re looking for. Use these letters to draw your own.
    There isn&#39;t really another way to do this well. Stretching and pulling letters
    using envelopes in photoshop, illustrator, or kpt will not get it done. You will
    spend more time looking for fonts and manipulating them, than you would drawing
    and learning. Plus there&#39;s nothing more fun than drawing woodtype. &#40;ok,

    there isn&#39;t more sharing of these kinds of hi-res resouces. It seems like
    people want to hang on to their secrets gems rather than get the word out. I&#39;ve
    often dreamed of a destination for designers that had links to all kinds of incredible
    resources like those. Not just a fat list, but well done and organized by keywords
    etc. Does it exist already? <BR> <BR>So, I wasted another 1/2 day looking a WPA
    Posters scanned at 28Megs over at American Memories. Only the government could
    &#34;afford&#34; that kind of bandwith. Amazing. <BR> <BR>Glad it was useful.
