  body: "I was trying to use the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]] on it, but I couldn't see enough key letters. If you have a more
    complete sample, perhaps you could try it yourself. It may be tricky deciding
    which form of certain letters to choose, and in those cases, leave out that choice.
    More upper case letters would have helped.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
