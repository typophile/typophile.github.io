  body: "You could approach it with only contact information that pertains to phone
    and email. You could use a web address instead of a physical one. You can list
    the city, state without a street address. A lot of options.\r\n\r\nAnother would
    be, to take the opportunity to create an identity that reflects your transition,
    and then when you're established again, create a new identity. You're a designer,
    you're quite capible of doing any of the above or nothing at all. "
