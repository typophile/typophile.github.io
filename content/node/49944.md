  Python that would be useful for learning to use it with Fontlab? I\u2019ve been
  trying to read <em>Learning Python</em> from O\u2019Reilly but it\u2019s clearly
  written for C programmers and thus manages to be simultaneously ponderous, redundant,
  silly and just makes for an incredibly tedious read. It\u2019s sort of like trying
  to get through the monologues in <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> but harder to justify."

  body: "\"Learning Python\" is a book that I always refer to when I have questions.
    It's very good as it provides the fundamentals of using Python as the scripting
    language. But you don't have to read the whole book page by page. You can just
    focus on learning about Python's building blocks \u2014 integers, strings, list,
    dictionaries \u2014 and how to manipulate them. Once you know the language's basics
    you can then turn to learning FontLab's API, understand how the objects \u2014
    fonts, glyphs, kerning, etc. \u2014 are structured and what methods and properties
    they have. It will take time to wrap your head around these things, but once you
    get it it won't be that difficult to develop small scripts that help a lot with
    repetitive tasks.\r\n\r\nThe [[http://dev.fontlab.net/flpydoc/|FontLab 4.5 Python
    reference]] is not fully up-to-date, but for the most part it has everything you
    need. (The stuff that's missing is mainly related with handling MM fonts)\r\n\r\nAnd
    don't forget [[Robofab]]. Using Robofab you'll be able to achieve a lot more with
    less lines of code. Follow [[http://www.robofab.org/talks/|Robofab's step by step
    crash course]] and take a look at the [[http://www.robofab.org/talks/examples/|Example
    scripts]].\r\n\r\nAnd be aware that FontLab has many many quirks. That's probably
    not news to you, but just letting you know that the scripting side of FontLab
    is not perfect either."

  body: "I rely entirely on the official documentation from the Python website. The
    Tutorial is a brilliant, informal introduction with just the right mix of explanation
    and code examples. You will probably need the Reference and Library Reference
    only when you get somewhat deeper into it. I also got some printed python books
    from the library but I didn't find any of them as useful.\r\n\r\nAnd then, the
    Fontlab Python reference mentioned by Miguel is essential, of course."
