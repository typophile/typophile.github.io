  and clean look of the first (Mercury text) and the more intricate look of the second
  (Computer modern).\r\n\r\nI would use the second as my text font but it prints too
  light and it is less legible than the first. In addition, the line spacing is very
  annoying.\r\n\r\nCould you please recommend a happy medium? Also, which of these
  two would you use as a text body font?\r\n\r\n"
