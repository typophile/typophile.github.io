  scanned (in a very decent resolution) EVERY page of EVERY issue of Life Magazine,
  fom 1935 to the seventies, and made it available for free online. The advertisements
  especially are a typographic treasure.\r\n\r\ndr"

    print advertising, I was particularly pleased to happen upon Bert Cooper himself
    on page 9 of the March 16, 1962 issue. \r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=7lYEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false\r\n\r\n(Honestly,
    it takes very little to make me happy sometimes.)"

  body: "Now you will be able to do further analysis of Cooper Black usage :-)\r\n\r\nTypographically,
    the resolution isn't that great.\r\nSame thing with the Bodoni Manuale on CD.\r\n\r\nI
    guess that's a limitation of PDF format, in that they don't want to make the files
    too big for downloading.\r\n\r\nI wonder what the original scanning res was.\r\n\r\nBut
    it's better than Microfiche!\r\n\r\nNext, it would be cool to be able to flag
    metadata, such as design credits and of course typeface information."
