body: "Hello folks!\r\n\r\nI cam across this rather tasty grotesque in the most recent
  issue of Little White Lies (UK film magazine). Instantly my brain went for Berthold's
  Akzidenz Grotesk Condensed Italic, then Trade Gothic Condensed 20 Oblique, then
  E+F's TV Nord Condensed Bold Oblique, but no cigar. Though they're all relatively
  similar, the squared shoulders of the R and S (amongst others) set this one apart.
  Other weights in regular and italic appear in the mag, so it would appear to be
  part of a larger family.\r\n\r\nAppreciate the help!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/littlewhitelies_4454.jpg]"

  body: Quite unusual. It looks like Akzidenz Grotesk Bold Condensed Italic, but it
    has an R that looks more like Trade Gothic Bold Condensed Oblique.

  body: "Well well well...weeks later, we have a match! It is, it seems, Akzidenz
    Grotesk Bold Condensed Italic, in Berthold's new OpenType suite. It seems they
    have transposed the Helvectica-style cap-R to the \"Alt\" variant of the font.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/590037.html]]\r\n\r\nHuzzah!"

    else?"
