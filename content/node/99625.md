  \r\n\r\nWould anyone here know and/or recognize the typeface that is used for Flickr
  tags? I've inserted two images which show the tags. The first one is a close-up
  and the second one has the tags on the bottom right hand corner. \r\n\r\nThank You[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FlickrTypeface1_4002.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FlickrTypeface2_6391.jpg]"
