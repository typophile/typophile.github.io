  and Condensed Bold Italic.\r\n\r\nAvailable here:\r\n[[http://openfontlibrary.org/font/earthbound]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EBfontSample_6716.png]\r\n\r\nKinda
  wondering if it's even condensed enough to call \"Condensed.\"\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    could say that it's a bit too tight, but not condensed.\r\n\r\nBut to get a better
    feel for this font it would help to give it beat more leading as it does have
    a rather high x-height."

  body: "Ok, thx. Maybe a lower x-height would be better . . . and if I stick with
    that spacing, maybe it would be semi-condensed?\r\n\r\nI think I have a new version
    of this that just needs a few tweaks and then I can upload an update . . ."
