  Nouveau typeface \"Gaisma\" (\"Light\" in Latvian) released through [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T1307|YouWorkForThem]].
  It draws inspiration from Vienna Secession movement and Nordic National Romanticism.
  The work on the design started as drawings of several characters for the graphic
  standard for the Jugendstil museum in Riga. It contains characters for all the European
  languages, Cyrillic and modern Greek as well as a huge set of contextual and stylistic
  alternates and historical characters to replicate texts of the era."
