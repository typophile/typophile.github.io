body: Is anyone opposed to working &#40;doing serious, in-depth work&#41; on more
  than one face at a time? <BR> <BR>Does anyone feel that to work on more than one
  would break their concentration?  Or is it necessary to have a few things going
  on at once, kind of like a way to step away and outside of a project in order to
  come back to it with a fresh perspective?
