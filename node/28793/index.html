		<div class="commentbody"><p>I only do occassional graphic design work at the moment, but I have worked for a few bigger firms, who each had purchasing and IT departments, who all had their say in fonts. Anyway, here are my answers.</p>
<p><em>1) Do you ever purchase fonts before you know what (paying) project they will be applied to?</em></p>
<p>Yes. I have almost only bought licenses for specific projects. It is a nice bonus that I get to use the fonts later on in the future. But when I think font licensing, I think short term use, i.e., the next project.</p>
<p><em>2a) Are you more inclined to purchase where you see a large family of weights, styles and cuts available?</em></p>
<p>Sort of. That depends what you mean by large! A family needs to have a few weights and variants for me. But 20? or 200? Not really, especially since I get fonts for specific projects, so I tend to know which weights I&rsquo;ll probably need.</p>
<p><em>2b) If so, do you prefer to purchase them all in one?</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Are the following important when deciding between fonts:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>International accents &amp; alphabets (European, Greek, etc.)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>A few years a go, no. But now, it is paramont. Since I&rsquo;m working in Central Europe, Eastern European accents are a requirement. Plus, staring Jan. 1, 2007, the EU will have three official writing systems in it (Latin, Greek, and Bulgarian Cyrillic).</p>
<p><em>4) Alternate characters (swash ‘&amp;’, ornamented letters)
5) Additional glyphs (archaic letters, dash suites)
6) OpenType “typographics” (alt. punctuation for caps, smart fractions)
7) OpenType “neatos” (random alternates, automated ligatures)</em></p>
<p>I love these, but they are never the deal maker or breaker for me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><ul>1) Do you ever purchase fonts before you know what (paying) project they will be applied to?</ul>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ul>2a) Are you more inclined to purchase where you see a large family of weights, styles and cuts available?</ul>
<p>Variety is always a good thing. But depending upon the family and use it is sometimes unnecessary.</p>
<ul>2b) If so, do you prefer to purchase them all in one?</ul>
<p>If I can afford it at the time I will license the entire family as in the long run it would be more expensive to license them bits at a time.</p>
<p>Are the following important when deciding between fonts:</p>
<ul>3) International accents & alphabets (European, Greek, etc.)</ul>
<p>Greek and Cyrillic are a different issue, but I think the type designer is being lazy if they can&rsquo;t at least include all/most diacritical marks. (Is that mean?)</p>
<ul>4) Alternate characters (swash ‘&’, ornamented letters)</ul>
<p>Depends upon the typeface. Sometimes the design is screaming for more, but I think this is a very subjective thing.</p>
<ul>5) Additional glyphs (archaic letters, dash suites)</ul>
<p>What do you mean by dash suites? Em and En dash? This again is a subjective thing and more of a specific need for a specific project. No?</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>OpenType “typographics” (alt. punctuation for caps, smart fractions)</li>
</ol>
<p>More and more I want OpenType. Especially if the family has small caps and extended ligature features.</p>
<ul>7) OpenType “neatos” (random alternates, automated ligatures)</ul>
<p>This seems backwards somehow.</p>
<ul>8) What other features strongly affect the decision? Price? Support? License choices? Anything else?</ul>
<p>The license of course. But again, if I license from a foundry with a very restrictive EULA I can only use the font in certain instances.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>1) Do you ever purchase fonts before you know what (paying) project they will be applied to?</em></p>
<p>Yes. I pay for quality type for personal projects as well.</p>
<p><em>2a) Are you more inclined to purchase where you see a large family of weights, styles and cuts available?</em></p>
<p>Not directly; most of my projects only need a couple of styles.  I suppose having a larger family makes it more likely that the styles I need will be there, so it helps indirectly.</p>
<p><em>2b) If so, do you prefer to purchase them all in one?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll buy a full family if it&rsquo;s one I expect to use a lot, or if I need enough that the full family is not significantly more expensive.  Otherwise, no.</p>
<p><em>3) International accents &amp; alphabets (European, Greek, etc.)</em></p>
<p>Accents are important, but the only non-Latin writing system I use much is Japanese, and I certainly don&rsquo;t expect Western type designers to support <em>that</em>.  :)</p>
<p><em>4) Alternate characters (swash ‘&amp;’, ornamented letters)
5) Additional glyphs (archaic letters, dash suites)</em></p>
<p>Usually unimportant.</p>
<p><em>6) OpenType “typographics” (alt. punctuation for caps, smart fractions)</em></p>
<p>Convenient, but not essential. With the lengths of text I work with, it&rsquo;s just as easy to tweak things by hand.</p>
<p><em>7) OpenType “neatos” (random alternates, automated ligatures)</em></p>
<p>Largely irrelevant to me.  (I&rsquo;d include standard ligatures in &ldquo;typographics&rdquo; myself, so I assume you mean fancy ligatures here.)</p>
<p><em>8) What other features strongly affect the decision? Price? Support? License choices? Anything else?</em></p>
<p>The EULA.  Restricting embedding is a big minus, permitting modification is a big plus.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I buy fonts without knowing what I&rsquo;m going to do with them all too frequently. I seldom buy large families since I find I don&rsquo;t use the full range.</p>
<p>European, including Eastern Europe, support is important to me, and I have set a few phrases in Greek, so that&rsquo;s nice, but not really too important to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for Opentype features, and wouldn&rsquo;t buy a text face that didn&rsquo;t have smallcaps and osfs available.</p>
<p>The EULA is <em>very</em> important to me. If embedding isn&rsquo;t allowed, I <em>won&rsquo;t</em> buy. I really want the right to make modifications for my own use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in the least interested in faces that have smallcaps and ligatures in separate fonts unless the EULA permits modifications, in which case I&rsquo;ll gladly make an OT version for myself.</p>
<p>If there is an OT version, I <em>might</em> consider a face with a EULA that restricts modifications, but even then I&rsquo;m leery.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>These are interesting responses. I predicted a few quite wrongly. It sounds like internationalization is as important to  others as it to me, for a variety of reasons. A lot of the other features I asked about sound more important to someone formatting an entire book, than to a designer laying short work ion display text?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the harm modifications could do in a purchased font. Presumably, releasing any modifications as a packaged font file is usually condemned by earlier terms of a license. Is this really a common problem? It seems like a worthless clause, since one could simply modify graphics in  front or behind the font output, anyhow, to achieve the same effect. Are small foundries commonly overly-restrictive?</p>
<p>Would purchasers be interested in the same font (or family) with different licenses for different prices? Or is that confusing?</p>
