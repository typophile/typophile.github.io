  body: "My understanding is that most movie studios were not making direct use of
    fonts for movie titles and credits when this movie was made, i.e. 1951. Metal
    type was not up to the job. There was plenty of work for letterers.  Film types
    were made by photographing hand-drawn letters. Photo-type techniques of working
    directly from fonts had been invented, but were not universal in 1951.\r\nIf anyone
    has any specific info on the techniques used at Ealing Studios circa 1951, it
    would be welcome.\r\nI see some similarities to Plantin http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/plantin/
    for most letters and to Perpetua http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/perpetua/ for
    the _g_.\r\nI trust there are other fonts that would fit all or part of these
    titles and credits.\r\nDon"
