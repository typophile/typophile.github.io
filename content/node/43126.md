body: I see this font a lot, yet I don't know it. It looks like an extra extra condensed
  Trade Gothic.

    or Opentype version.

  body: "Well, look at the spur of the G. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not Steelfish,
    but it\u2019s close (and cheap). I said it could be Alternate Gothic, because
    I wasn\u2019t so sure myself.\r\n\r\nAndrew - whenever Angel or Akira (and many
    others) show up I feel like a complete amateur ;-)"

    I can even keep up with Stewf, but Angel he's a whole other beast all together.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I was looking at that spur too, and I think it's still to hard to tell at 72pt.
    but you might be right, it might be too sharp. However, the rest of the letter
    forms look right, even better than Alternative Gothic, and the price is right!"
