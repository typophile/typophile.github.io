  I've come up with is Bolt, but some of the letters are way off. Any help you could
  offer is greatly appreciated. This is an early 80's font to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks."

    have existed as a phototypesetting face (never digitized).\r\n\r\nReminds me of
    Adrian Frutiger's EDF-GDF (a custom typeface for the French national electric
    and gas utility), but not a match either.\r\n\r\nSee this post for a sample and
    for links to similar typefaces:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/118773"

    only on video. Thanks to your link though, I see there are a few alternatives
    that I could probably work with. Cheers my friend. '
