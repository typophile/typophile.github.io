  of type design, that it would be fun to be able to take typographical \"tests\"...
  since i never had a chance to take any classes dedicated solely to typography, i
  think it'd be a great way to learn more about identifying typefaces as well as better
  understanding the history and technique of it all.\r\n\r\nwould any of you be willing
  to put such a thing together?? does something like this exist?? i just feel like
  i'd really understand everything a lot better if i constantly was working on identifying
  things like this.\r\n\r\njust a simple kind of quiz or test with examples of fonts
  from specific movements, or asking to identify a face by its name, maybe stuff on
  kerning, spacing, etc etc\r\n\r\nor is this idea retarded :("

  body: "> <em>or is this idea retarded</em> :(\r\n\r\nNope, not retarted, but incredibly
    time consuming for the contributors/authors. There are some useful sites out there
    that have been mentioned in Typophile posts and I believe some are listed in the
    Typowiki section.\r\n"
