  been inspired to go above and beyond the usual combination of WinANSI/MacOS Roman
  characters, which means adding quite a few additional diacritical alternates.\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on a script to generate it and would like to find the most comprehensive
  possible list of these characters to feed into it. I was thinking about using RoboFab,
  but I'd really prefer to write the script myself in this case, and their list apparently
  claims to be non-comprehensive and not guranteed to be accurate.\r\n\r\nAny idea
  where I can find a comprehensive, accurate list?"

    but even analyzing all those PDFs for the Latin characters alone can be overwhelming.\r\n\r\nThe
    [[http://diacritics.typo.cz/|Diacritics project]] explains the usage of many accents
    in several languages. It is very informative, but it still has some holes to be
    filled."

  body: "Thanks for the info guys. I actually realized that the info I need, at least
    most of it, comes from Adobe's AGLFN. The best part is that I've also got the
    unicode indices in each character as well. I've now got about 200+ diacritical
    pairs formatted for use in my script. I think this is everything I need to build
    sufficiently broad character sets with my glyphs.\r\n\r\nThanks guys!"
