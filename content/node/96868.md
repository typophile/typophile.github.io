  are funky. Does anyone know if a Linotype-style Didot exists with numerals that
  correspond to the different HTF weights? Thanks!

    body: Yes that's the version we're using, but we'd like the numerals to be in
      the Linotype style (see attached). I'm just wondering if these Linotype-style
      numerals come in different weights like the HTF version (which has different
      serif weight versions for point sizes varying between 6 and 95). [img:sites/default/files/old-images/linotype-didot_6330.gif]

    just the right matching numerals do considering having a set** made to your exact
    specifications, which is the sort of work I do regularly for clients:\r\nhpapazian
    at gmail dot com\r\n\r\n* Which BTW is more than just about serif thickness -
    it's meant for use at varying point sizes - AKA \"optical scaling\".\r\n\r\n**
    Although since H&FJ does not allow modification they would have to work as separate
    fonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
