  says friendly future about this face and I'd love to know if it's publicly available.\r\n\r\nhttp://bikemonthnyc.org/
  for more possible instances.\r\n\r\nAnd since I'm asking, what's the proper term
  for the line through the \"O\"?\r\n\r\nThanks, and I'll try to contribute something
  next time.\r\n\r\nJeff"

    to this font. In calligraphic terms it would either be the start of a connecting
    stroke or a flourish, but since it doesn't extend out of the letter to do either
    I'm not sure what it should be called. \r\nIt is an odd character but I like it."
