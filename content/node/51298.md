body: "Microsoft had released Language support for many Indian Languages with WindowsXP.
  Crude and badly designed, the Malayalam typeface Karthika is an eyesore. With badly
  formed shapes, incorrect spacing and incorrect conjunct formation, the typeface
  and language support really mocks the language. Obviosuly people who didn't know
  the language were involved and made a mess out of it. On top of it, the OpenType/
  Unicode support given is faulty and gives more disservice to the language.\r\n\r\nSome
  improvement was expected over the years, but nothing has happened. Unfortunately
  for want of a choice, people are using it for blogs and sites as if this is the
  norm/ default. This is likely to corrupt typography in the language and general
  aethetics forever.\r\n\r\nAs a langauge lover and type designer in the language
  what can be done?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/malayalam_3550.gif]"

    I've come across some OpenSource Malayalam fonts, but I never installed any of
    them, so I can't say which ones are Unicode-encoded, and which aren't.\r\n\r\nHashim,
    which Malayalam fonts do you like better?\r\n"

    we need in Malayalam is something like Verdana or Georgia (or even Helvetica and
    Times), tuned for the screen and looking neat too. \r\n\r\nThe made-for print
    fonts are too rounded to suit the purpose. Micrososft's Karthika could have looked
    and worked better had some linguists and designers who know the language were
    genuinely involved.\r\n\r\nBut I guess that is what happens in most Asian scripts!"

  body: "I was Prof. Joshi's student and he passed away this February. He was been
    my source of inspiration too to get into language typography which hasn't kept
    apace with developments in technology. He was more into Devanagari typography,
    but I believe was also involved with Microsoft's Indian language efforts to some
    extent. But Indian scripts being many and so diverse one cannot expect one person
    to be an expert in all of them. \r\n\r\nTurning on ClearType will makes it slightly
    better, but exaggerates its bad shapes further. I believe for on screen-reading
    bitmap fonts work best with B&W pixels\u2014 Verdana nd Gorgia being the best
    models to emulate. The language technology part needs to be corrected first, with
    better and more acceptable conjunct formations and then the shapes which needs
    to be screen-friendly. merely replicating the print fonts for on-screen use is
    also hampering other Indian languages, to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\nLinotype
    Manorama designed by Fiona Ross is a good evolutionary model, though may not suitable
    for on-screen viewing. We need original designs which are hand-tuned for the screen.\r\n"

  body: "No doubt. Prof. Joshi was the right person, but I wish linguists and type
    designers in the language were also consulted before designing the default typefaces
    in each language. I have heard similar complaints from other friends speaking
    different Indian languages.\r\n\r\nI can help with Malayalam if needed, having
    designed many typefaces in Malayalam (www.design-difference.com/typedes.htm).
    But the Unicode/ OpenType problem also needs to be addressed simultaneously to
    make it acceptable to a larger audience.\r\n\r\nAs you know there are two versions
    of Malayalam rendering: the traditional one (as recommended by Rachana, a group
    that recommends close to 900 characters to bring the language back to its original
    glory) and the reformed one (INSCRIPT/ C-DAC Gist with about 150 characters) which
    is more popular other than those used by various publishing houses (Summit's Indica,
    Mathrubhumi'system etc.). Karthika doesnot even match upto the INSCRIPT standards,
    bringing down typography in the language a few notches down. Script reformation
    in the 60's was an ill-thought-out step to make typewriters handle Malayalam,
    but Windows implementation corrupts the language further.\r\n\r\n  "

    OpenType fonts use this choice differently in different fonts, so that the user
    has a choice between say Kartika (traditional script) and Kartika (reformed script)?\r\n\r\nAlso
    Simon, the tools that you have shown wrt Verdana are Mac-specific and may no longer
