  Beowulf came out, and I've always\r\nthought it was a fascinating idea for a font.
  One magazine (I\r\ndon't recall which) featured it alongside another similar font,\r\ncalled,
  IIRC, Burroughs (after William S.) that randomized not\r\njust the outline of the
  letterform, but each entire word. The\r\nfont embedded a small dictionary, and substituted
  each word with\r\na random entry, so that when a string of text was printed it\r\nproduced
  a an unrelated text.\r\n\r\n<!--break--> \r\n\r\nWho created this font? What was
  it called? Is it still available? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance, \r\n\r\nDerek \r\n"
