  It looks a little like Simple my Norm. Unfortunately a friend sent it to me so I'm
  not sure where it is originally from.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: "Seems like I've seen that sort of A before. For example, [[http://www.dafont.com/dev-gothic.font?nb_ppp=50&text=ARCHITRONIC|Dev
    Gothic]] is not rounded, but it has this style of A.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: it's very possible someone just turned Dev Gothic in to outlines and added
    a rounded corner effect

  body: Thanks for all your help on this. Decima seemed the closest out of the lot
    but I know what it is... Gravur Condensed, by the main man, Cornel Windlin. I
    don't know why I didn't think of it, I guess I was so hung up on it being some
    sort of Simple because of the 'A'. Turns out Architonic customised that themselves.
