  you could perhaps help me.\r\n\r\nEssentially, I have the exact same problem as
  http://typophile.com/node/4834. When I export my .indd to .eps format the letters
  go out of place and the font loses some of its formatting.\r\n\r\nI can get around
  the problem by creating outlines of the font, but that seems like a cumbersome method
  to me.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know more about this problem and how I can work around
  it (easily).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    no expert in InDesign but, you might try PRINTING it to Distiller, then opening
    the PDF in Illustrator and saving as an EPS.\r\nMight work, might not, but it's
    worth a shot AND it ought to preserve the type as type."
