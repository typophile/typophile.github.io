  body: Sports team jersey typefaces are usually custom jobs. I must say I hadn't
    seen this one before.

  body: "From the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq\">FAQ</a>:\r\n\r\n<a
    name=\"Q_16\"><strong>And logos of sports teams?</strong></a>\r\nThere you have
    to keep in mind that sports merchandising -- everything from baseball caps to
    soccer jerseys -- is big business, so the popular sports teams have every reason
    to make their logo as difficult to imitate as possible. Most of them are custom
    designed or use heavily customized existing fonts."
