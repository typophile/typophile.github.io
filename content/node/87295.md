  4 or 5 to FontLab Studios 5? I know you used to be able to do it from ScanFont to
  FontLab 4.6. What I mean is after you separate shapes into individual cells in Scanfont,
  you used to be able to then select individual shaped and drag them from ScanFont
  and drop them into specific glyph with in FontLab. I have not found a way to do
  this in FontLab Studios 5. Any help or information would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."
