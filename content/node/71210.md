  body: You may want to read up on how dot matrix printers work. Specifically that
    they have text and graphics modes. In text mode it accepts raw text (i.e. w/o
    any formatting) and prints it with its currently active font (that may be customized).
    The font size is fixed and cannot be changed. The graphics mode may be used to
    print arbitrary formatted text, but you are effectively printing an image and
    so it comes with its can of worms.
