body: "Hi guys-\r\n  Was wondering if anyone can ID the font used in the header of
  this website www.rxtrace.com - for the word RXtrace. I also attached an image of
  it.\r\n\r\nI created this graphic and now I'm doing an official logo for the site,
  but I can't find the font on my system and from what I can tell the client doesn't
  want to stray too far from it, if at all.  I can't remember for the life os me what
  it was.\r\n\r\nany help would be greatly appreciated. Does anyone know of a similar
  font that would work in corporate deisgn.  I've tried looking everywhere for other
  similar fonts that have the exaggerated ball terminals that this one has, any suggestions
  along those lines would be helpful as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks so much\r\nMatt"
