body: "Hello, was wondering if anybody could ID the font used for some of the display
  type all over this website. Sorry I can't find a bigger sample--I have a little
  booklet I picked up but don't have access to a scanner right now. It seems sort
  of like New Clarendon or New Century Schoolbook or something but off the top of
  my head the tail on the 'a' looks a little different and it has that weird thingy
  on top of the 'g.'\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere's the
  URL:\r\n\r\nhttp://systembolaget.se/AlkoholHalsa\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: They've definitely flipped the ear on the g, that's for sure, and it actually
    looks (to me) like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-701/">News
    701</a>, slightly squished.

  body: Looks like a condensed version on a "century" face. New Century Schoolbook
    seems accurate, but the face in question is more condensed and lighter?
