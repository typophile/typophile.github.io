  to OSX because of the Quirk &#40;Quark&#41; issues, I have been migrating some of
  them to InDesign &#40;some kicking and screaming, some not&#41; and I want to settle
  on a font repair and font manager so I decide to ask you font pros what you like.   <BR>I
  am leaning toward Font Agent Pro because of the repair tool but don&#39;t think
  it is very intuitive,  I like Master Juggler because it is from Alsoft who makes
  DiskWarrior which I LOVE, I could not do my job without it.  <BR>Please add a note
  on your OS and application, 10.3.2 and Indesign for example. <BR>What font manager
  works for you?  <BR>What does not?   <BR>Issues, likes and dislikes? <BR>Reliability?
  <BR>Thanks, <BR>vudutu '

    the forum search and look for &#34;manager&#34;. This has been  <BR>discussed
    many times already - even in the last 3 months.

  body: Suitcase is poo. <BR> <BR>&#42; It tells me some fonts are damaged, even though
    they&#39;re straight copies from a Linotype disc. <BR> <BR>&#42; Autoactivation
    is a joke. With Adobe CS apps I activate in Suitcase, switch back to app, font
    not there, click outside text box, click inside again, font appears. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    Any other apps, you don&#39;t get autoactivation anyway &#40;I don&#39;t run Quark&#41;
    and must quit and relaunch. <BR> <BR>&#42; It regularly hangs, and likes to take
    down other apps with it. <BR> <BR> <BR>This is on a dual G5 with up to date patches,
    btw. <BR> <BR>Having said all this, I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s anything better
    than Suitcase out there. Being a large&#40;ish&#41; company, it&#39;s likely Extensis
    will get there act together sometime soon.

  body: Thanks all, <BR>I will go back and post some review of everything I have looked
    at.  I am a little leery of Suitcase because of pre OSX issues and what I am hearing
    about the OSX version.  Also one thing that bothers me about Extensis is they
    have bolted together a solution from three different products and my past experience
    with companies who buy code is they tend to not support it well in the future.  <BR>  <BR>Right
    now I am leaning toward two possible solutions, Font Agent Pro for repair/management/display.

    works out.

  body: "vudutu,\r\n\r\nGlad to see your a Master Juggler fan. I've tried all of the
    font managers and I like MJ the best. To me it works very much like the old ATM
    Deluxe that had so many fans back in pre-X days.\r\n\r\nI think MJ's biggest advantage
    is not building its own database of the fonts. It just turns them on and off,
    anywhere they are located, and it doesn't have to be running all the time. Launch,
    active your fonts, quit. It does lack an auto-activation, but I was told by Alsoft
    that that would be in an upgrade. I fear that the upgrade may be a long wait since
    MJ is definitly a cult font manager at this point.\r\n\r\nJames\r\n\r\n10.4.2

    Suitcase and I really like the way the interface is setup and organize my types.
    Also like the preview area better than in suitcase and seems to integrate with
    Indesign quite well.\r\n\r\nIs this only free now because it is still beta or
    is the goal to always keep it free?"

    was floundering on OS X until Linotype Font Explorer X came out. The only thing
    I miss in it over Font Reserve is the ability to print sample sheets in various
    configurations. It is much more stable and has far better sorting options. I've
    heard some bad things about the latest update, though, so I'm hesitating to install
    it until the next patch comes in."

    give it another try. I've been loving it; it works the way I want a font manager
    to do. I don't like the ones that make their own secret copy of things or move
    my data around. FontExplorer adds some iTunes-like features, like making new sets
    from any fonts already activated or added.\r\n\r\nI use font managers to test
    fonts in development, so my usage is probably different from that of most graphic
    designers, but the convenience of activation is the big hook for me, and that's
    useful to anyone with a lot of fonts they don't want installed permanently. "
