body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Designers]] : Hermann Zapf</strong>\r\n\r\nGerman,
  born 1918.\r\n\r\nCalligrapher and type designer, perhaps the most influential designer
  of types in the post-WWII era. Designer of [[Optima]], [[Palatino]], [[Aldus]],
  [[Zapf Chancery]], [[Zapf Dingbats]], [[Zapfino]], and with [[Akira Kobayashi]],
  [[Zapfino Extra]], [[Optima nova]], [[Palatino nova]], [[Palatino Sans]], and [[Palatino
  Sans Informal]]. Zapf's most notable achievement is his effortless bridging of the
  Medieval era with the Information Age; his types are all characterized by their
  strong [[calligraphic]] influence, but more than any of the other designers who
  came to maturity in the metal type era, he has adapted to the digital era. He also
  has the dubious honor of having been the victim of one of the [[20th Century]]'s
  more acrimonious disputes over [[type piracy]]; see the entry on [[Book Antiqua]]
  for details.\r\n\r\nZapf's efforts are not limited to his type and calligraphic
  work. He has been involved in many of the most significant technological developments
  in the era of digital typography. From his groundbreaking work with [[Donald Knuth]]
  on [[TeX]] to his collaboration with [[John Hudson]], [[Akira Kobayashi]] and [[Adam
  Twardoch]] on successive refinements of the semi-sentient script typeface [[Zapfino]],
  he has not shied away from contemporary developments in type technology.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  his most significant (and unsung) achievement in this realm was developing the  [[hz-program]]
  for [[URW]], a justification engine that used the novel technique of [[glyph scaling]]
  to help achieve even color in extended settings of text. This engine, after several
  rounds of refinement and licensing, has become the justification engine in [[Adobe]]'s
  [[InDesign]], and is one of the most distinctive typographical features of that
  program.\r\n\r\nNow in his late 80s, Zapf continues to work, drafting letters and
  practicing calligraphy. He is married to calligrapher and type designer [[Gudrun
  Zapf von Hesse]].\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Additional Articles:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/23728.html\">dot-font:
