  by the experts is near anyhow.\r\nThe typeface of the Chanel logo.\r\n\r\n1) Who
  did design it? Is it known?\r\n\r\n2) On what character is it based?\r\n\r\n3) Is
  it available in any form? (not that I want to have it)\r\n\r\nStefan\r\nthanks"

    was the most recent thread I found using Google. I don't know whether the designer
    was ever identified -- presumably Chanel has an art department that could have
    done this many, many years ago (pre-digital era). \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I read somewhere that Coco Chanel designed the logo herself in 1925 (which
    is most probably only true for the mark). But the logotype is just as old.

  body: Funny, the current (No. 65, Autumn 07) issue of <em>Eye</em> magazine discusses
    this very logo along with other fashion typography, but no designer is credited.
