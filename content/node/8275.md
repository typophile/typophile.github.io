  body: 'Hi Ole, <BR> <BR>I commend you on incorporating the typography with the underlying
    structure of your composition. It is a tricky thing to balance; with many layers
    of type and image you run into a lot of spots for potential awkwardness OR potential
    beautiful relationships. <BR> <BR>There are a few key areas that I would pay particular
    attention to in this piece: <BR> <BR>1. The area where the flame meets his hand.
    It sort of looks like his hand is being consumed by the flame. It doesn&#39;t
    look polished enough to be intentional- it just looks unfinished. <BR> <BR>2.
    The area where his hand rests on the &#40;windowsill?&#41; and interacts with
    the &#34;t&#34;. This focal point would be a great place to really activate your
    typography. Maybe the &#34;t&#34; becomes the windowframe in the middle of your
    composition, bringing the window to the foreground on the right half of your composition.
    <BR> <BR>Just a few things to think about. The devil is in the details. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Great points Sarah. Unfortunantly this work will properly never go any futher
    unless I decide to rework it solely for my portfolio. The publication it was intended
    for is no longer in business. The work was incomplete as I was still waiting for
    final text to be supplied from my editor at the time.
