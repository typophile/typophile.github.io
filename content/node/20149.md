body: "I am currently working on a graphic design education project. I am investigating
  educational and instructional materials, particularly those known as reusable learning
  objects such as Flash movies, interactive or otherwise. I am seeking examples of
  animated typographic pieces; these could be interactive, artistic and/or educational.
  As an example of the type of items that I\u2019m seeking, there are some basic interactive
  animations included under the \u2018anatomy\u2019 section of this site: http://www.rsub.com/typographic/
  and an artistic piece here: http://www.arabictypography.com/flash.html (to view
  click one of the lighter moving squares)\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows of other such sites
  and would like to share, I\u2019d be grateful. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"

    believe it or not, typographic porn. See it <a href="http://www.fontfabrik.com/Porno_A.html">here.</a>
