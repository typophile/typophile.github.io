  body: My band wants to use this font in our website. I&#39;ve done some of the characters
    but I&#39;m very very slow. If we could just buy this font instead of recreating
    it, that would be very helpful. Anyone?

  body: If for some reason no one IDs this font, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/lithia/light/testdrive.html?s=GLADSTONE&amp;p=96">Lithia
    Light</a> might be an acceptable substitute, though I like your sample better.

  body: That is really pretty and I haven&#39;t seen anything like it. <BR>I think
    it&#39;s worth digitizing.

  body: It rings of both <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/radiant-extra-condensed-ct/">Radiant</a>
    and Nick Shinn&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/eunoia/">Eunoia</a>,
    but it&#39;s a wee bit sexier around the edges, no?

    target="_blank"> Ersatz</a> is not really close, but has some interesting little
    &#34;serifs&#34; Too bad it doesn&#39;t come condensed.

  body: Thanks for the feedback so far. It&#39;s a little frustrating that this may
    not be available on-line, but in a way I guess that&#39;s good since if few people
    can use this digitally it will stand out more on our site. <BR>Oh and thanks so
    much for the fonts that are close - even if we don&#39;t end up using them they&#39;re
    great as reference points on how I could try to recreate characters not seen on
    the card box, which is all I have to go on. <BR> <BR>In case anyone&#39;s interested,
    our band is Canasta, and you can see the simple photoshop job we did to change
    GLADSTONE to CANASTA at <a href="http://www.canastamusic.com" target="_blank">www.canastamusic.com</a>.
    We&#39;re also playing a show October 9th at the Metro here in Chicago, for anyone
    in this neck of the woods. :-&#41;
