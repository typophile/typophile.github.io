  this. I didn't have found introduction thread anywhere, so I'm introducing myself
  here, if any inconvenience occurred, I apologise. I have a special interest in Computer
  software packages. I found this forum very informative and I am really very excited
  here to take part in discussions. Hope you will contribute your ideas and support
  me in my mission.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nElevish Holic"

    are a user of the Arial typeface, you are no longer allowed to use Arial, it is
    forbidden. ;) ;) ;)
