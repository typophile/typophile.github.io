  body: Yeah, Lydian is somewhat similar. But I'd like to find one that's a bit closer.
    Thanks for the response!

  body: "Two suggestions come to mind: Canada Type's version of Kitterland, called
    <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/hamlet/' target='_blank'>Hamlet</a>
    and Larabie's hybrid of verona and Motto, called <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/mikadan/'
    target='_blank'>Mikadan</a>.\r\n\r\nIt depends on which caps you prefer. That
    V in your image looks really out of place to me and isn't much of a help."
