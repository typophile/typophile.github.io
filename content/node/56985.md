body: "I meet enough new people to be initially curious about almost everyone.  Sometimes
  new acquaintances click and we get to spend time mutually talking about our passions.
  Such is the case with brilliant and 27 year old Dorothy Ball\u2014poet\u2014newly
  returned to New Orleans from living in NYC and editing at Princeton University Press.\r\n\r\nShe
  teaches me the difference between 2 and 3 dimensional thinking.  In return I run
  on about type and design theory.  We both like to read and the subject of \"dead
  white male authors\" came up. Dorothy mentioned she had never read any of them because
  when she went to school they weren't being taught anymore.  I love reading these
  old farty dinosaurs so made a list.  \r\n\r\nThe list is chronological because I
  find themes repeated throughout.  Some of the most beautiful language can be found
  in these pages, and some of the best lessons.  If anyone wants good reading, and
  or a giggle, it is here attached.\r\n"
