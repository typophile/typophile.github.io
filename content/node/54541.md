  iPhone?\r\n\r\nHere's how it would work: 1) you point the camera at the text in
  question; 2) you take a picture; 3) and then you let the app identify the typeface
  for you while you wait. (Maybe there's an intermediate step between 2 and 3 where
  you verify that you've taken the correct photo and that you didn't make it come
  out all blurry.)\r\n\r\nScenario 1:\r\nYou're reading a beautiful old book and are
  wondering what type it's set in; you check the colophon and copyright pages--nothing
  doing. No problem, you take out your iPhone, open the type-identification app, snap
  a photo of the book, and wait a second. A second later, the app tells you the name
  of the type that the book was set in.\r\n\r\nScenario 2:\r\nYou and your friends
  are arguing about the typeface that Wes Anderson always uses--the one that looks
  a bit like Futura but isn't Futura. Is it Avenir? No one can agree. Someone takes
  out her/his iPhone and . . . you get the idea.\r\n\r\n--Justin"

  body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nWith regards to your problem, I think that main problem with
    the current iPhones (first and second model) is the camera\u2014it's no good at
    macro unless you use something like <a href=\"http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/clarifi\">this</a>.\r\n\r\nOther
    than that rather large obstacle, it shouldn't be too hard to develop a service
    to upload a photo from your iPhone library and generate a TinyURL-style address
    for you to enter into What The Font. It may already be possible to do this with
    a combination of available applications, but I haven't tried.\r\n\r\nSo until
    the iPhone camera/lens improves, scenario 1 is going to be hard.\r\n\r\nScenario
    2:\r\nIt is Futura (bold).\r\n\r\nIf/when the iPhone camera can do macro well,
    I look forward to something like this being developed (along with something like
    <a href=\"http://www.biggu.com/\">ShopSavvy</a> from the Android Market).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I now see that MyFonts has released a WhatTheFont iPhone application (I won't
    post the link) and I suspect that the original poster Justin, who only joined
    to post this \"request\", is part of a not-so-subtle marketing attempt. Justin,
    Nick Sherman and MyFonts are all based in (or near) Boston, Nick is a MyFonts
    employee.\r\n\r\nIf I'm wrong, sorry\u2014it's just a coincidence that the comment
    was made after the application was submitted to Apple\u2014but if I'm right, Justin
    and Nick should be ashamed. Couldn't you have simply made a post announcing the
    availability of the free application, or is that against the rules of the forum?
    MyFonts is a Typophile sponsor, so surely this could have been arranged.\r\n\r\nFor
    what it's worth, I think the application icon is awful.\r\nBoth the FontShop's
    FontShuffle application and this MyFonts one have terrible icons considering they
    are by and for designers and typographers.\r\n\r\nOnce again, if I am wrong, I
    am sorry for being so suspicious; maybe my tin foil hat is on too tightly.\r\n\r\nAndrew"

    did submit a formal announcement for the official Typophile <a href=http://typophile.com/news>news
    board</a> but it has yet to be approved/posted. I've been anxiously biting my
    tongue in hopes of receiving most of the feedback on that thread if/when it goes
    up, but couldn't help posting the \"just you wait\" comment.\r\n\r\nIronically,
    because of the decentralized quality of the MyFonts \"office\", our close proximity
    doesn't imply a co-conspirator relationship as much as you might think; the main
    person that I worked with on the iPhone app is Chris Lewis, and he lives in Japan

  body: "... This damn tin foil hat!\r\n\r\nI'm actually  glad that my powers of deduction
    have failed me in this case.\r\n\r\nI think this application will be much more
    useful when the iPhone camera is up to the task; so far I haven't had much luck
    with small text and certainly nothing as small as Justin's \"scenario 1\" book
    text. I imagine the Griffin Clarifi I linked to in my first post would make a
    big difference, but that's far from ideal. \r\nI'd like to read your thoughts
    on the current iPhone camera in relation to the intended purpose of WhatTheFont.\r\n\r\nI
    still think the icon is awful, is there any chance it could be made a bit more
    iPhone-y? I think it's the off-centre magnifying glass that bothers me most. I
    think the icon metaphor should be about finding a match rather than the search
    itself (magnifying glass).\r\n\r\nMaybe my problem with the magnifying glass is
    just further evidence that I am no Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nSorry. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Yeah, unfortunately, because of the limitations of the iPhone camera, close-up
    shots for smaller text don't work as well as we'd like. The blurriness doesn't
    sit well with the shape recognition process.

  body: "Good app but indeed Apple should update the camera! For larger samples like
    headers in newspapers and few type specimens it worked beautifully.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I miss is a kind of the app's internal library where all my cropped photo identifications
    would be archived together with approved corresponding fonts for later use.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    it's already implemented but I wonder if that such a user input could be used
    to improve the identification mechanism (computer finds few similar samples but
    users 'approve' one or two closest matches thus limiting potential errors)?\r\n\r\n________\r\n<a

  body: "I'm loving it.\r\n\r\nMy only criticism specific to the app is that I have
    had trouble using the touch-screen interface to combine broken-up glyphs. I have
    managed it twice, in my varied fumbling attempts, but I'm not sure how, and I
    can't yet do it at will. Where exactly am I meant to touch on the screen? And
    where am I meant to move my fingers to?\r\n\r\nSecond comment is probably one
    applicable to What The Font generally - is the database restricted to MyFonts-licensed
    typefaces?"

  body: "Yeah, the glyph combination isn't quite as fluid as we'd like. Hopefully
    we can improve that in a future update. In the mean time, it helps if you perform
    the glyph-combining pinch action with a bit of extra force. Chris Lewis describes
    it as though you're \"poking someone's eyes out\" :)\r\n\r\nAs for the fonts the
    app is able to recognize... they don't have to be fonts that we have permission
    to <em>license</em> necessarily, but they do have to be fonts that we have permission
    to have in our database. For example we've gotten permission from <a href=http://www.fontfont.com/>FontFont</a>
    to use their fonts for matching images submitted to WhatTheFont\u2026but we don't
    have permission to sell licenses to end-users on their behalf.\r\n\r\nNow, if
    the font someone is trying to identify with WhatTheFont is something we don't
    have in our database <em>at all</em>, we can only suggest close matches. A perfect
    example: WhatTheFont gets tons of submissions of images of Obama posters that
    are set in Hoefler & Frere-Jones' <a href=http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008>Gotham</a>;
    but because we don't have permission to have any H&FJ fonts in our database \u2014
    for sale or otherwise \u2014 we're unable to provide a perfect match.\r\n\r\nWith
    that said, MyFonts represents the world's largest collection of fonts (that I
    know of), so the matches for most images (of reasonable quality) submitted through
    WhatTheFont are pretty good, if not dead on. In that regard, a comparison between
    MyFonts and Amazon could be made: you might not find everything in the world,
    and some of what you do find might not be for sale, but it's a good place to start."
