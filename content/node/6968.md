  <BR> <BR> <BR>As far as I can see, it looks like Garamond; but then, many late 16th
  Century and early 17th Century books are not very different. <BR> <BR>Furthermore,
  is anyone able to provide me with information about the printer? <BR> <BR>Thank

  body: 'Hi all: <BR> <BR>I must confess I am a little downcast by the lack of responses
    to this thread.  <BR> <BR>To speak the truth, I have a great difficulty in telling
    apart 16th-17th century types. They all seem to be based on the same model and
    I honestly cannot tell the difference between, say, an Collines type from a Garamond
    one.  <BR> <BR>To complicate matters further, most of the Iberian 16th Century
    typography was based on that kind of design because the printing is so irregular
    - I often think revivals of these kind of types to be totally impossible.  <BR>
    <BR>Even if I can tell, at a glance and without looking at individual letters,
    most modern text types &#40;sometimes even foundry variants of the same design,
    but that takes a little longer&#41; when looking at a 16th Century book I find
    that terribly difficult - impossible, really. It is almost as if I had to try
    to gess the difference between Galliard cc and Galliard based on a page printed
    in a 150dpi inkjet printer.  <BR> <BR>Does anyone here have that feeling or did
    I post this thread in the wrong place? <BR> <BR>Remember, I&#39;m new here, so

  body: I know that this thread is out of place, hence the lack of responses. <BR>
    <BR>But I would like to tell people about my recent experiments.  <BR> <BR>I browsed
    - attentively - through a lot of 16th and 17th century books. I withdraw what
    I said about the great similarity of ancient fonts. They are subtly different,
    sometimes rather different from each other. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the
    Garamond kind of proportion and form was very widespread during the 16th and early
    17th century. <BR> <BR>Moreover, the wearing of the metal and the quality of paper
    and ink introduce very pronounced modifications in type made from the same matrices.
    This makes identification difficult. <BR> <BR>As you know, 16th Century based
    types survived well into the 18th century in Iberia &#40;that&#39;s Portugal and
    Spain&#41;. As I speak I have in front of me what seems to be a big version of
    Granjon&#39;s Galliard, published in Antwerpen in the first half of the 17th Century.
    But the Iberic type designers favoured what we now call Garalde up to the technical
    changes that appeared in the late 18th Century.  <BR> <BR>I know this is not very
    interesting for the majority of the forum members, but it just may interest someone
    &#40;although the persistence of the Garalde types in Iberia is a well known fact&#41;.  <BR>

    Mario Feliciano, specially his earlier fonts. I think they were based on Updike

    did a digital version of a Pradell font, and perhaps is interesting to have a

  body: Consider all of this a flow of thought and question it.  <BR> <BR>The beauty
    of this time period is that the type was being cut by a handful of individuals.
    &#40;Maybe two hands&#41; And they all influenced each other. From the 16th to
    the 17th centuries the type became more and more affected by not only the punchcutters
    but the paper and further the world happening around them. The more baroque and
    neoclassical the higher quality the paper became and so the little details in
    the type could really show. It isn&#39;t only about the intrinsic qualities of
    the type, but also the extrinsic affects the world had on the type.  <BR> <BR>Just
    some random, not very organized thoughts.  <BR> <BR>I think this thread could
    have more discussion, potentially, if it were in the GENERAL DISCUSSIONS area.
    Would you like it moved Rodrigo?

  body: 'Rodrigo: thanks for posting the Iberian example. Those are some really beautiful
    letters, although I think it will be more challenging than usual to make a revival
    due to the rather extreme variations between multiple impressions of the same
    letter. <BR> <BR>By the way, I have most of the Berner sheet at 1200 dpi. Follow
    the links from <a href="http://levien.com/type/berner/">levien.com/type/berner/</a>,
    then take off the &#34;_sm&#34;. Be warned that files that large may well bring
    your computer to a grinding halt. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m in the process of moving the
    archive to <a href="http://www.tug.org/">tug.org</a>, on which I won&#39;t have
    to worry so much about bandwidth, so all of the files will have high-res links.
    <BR> <BR>Hope you still find it useful. <BR> <BR>P.S. I understand Robert Slimbach
    is now working on an optically scaled version, to be called Garamond Masters if
    memory serves. It will probably be the definitive version when it&#39;s released,
    but fortunately there is lots of other good stuff from back then. I&#39;m partial
    to the work of Guillaume LeBe, myself.'

    I should have made that clear. I&#39;m not sure how close it is to the original,

  body: 'Dear Ralph: <BR> <BR>Thank you for the explanation. I have downloaded <BR>a
    few samples. They make it very clear that Clau- <BR>de Garamond was actually searching
    for regularity <BR>which the Slimbach versionconveys rather well.  <BR> <BR>I
    must say I am not very critical on Slimbach&#39;s <BR>work. If one prints text
    in 12 points we do get <BR>the kind of dignified regularity a good Garamond <BR>printed
    page offers. <BR> <BR>Now, I agree it is a little too soft and not so  <BR>stately
    as true Garamond. But it is, I believe, by <BR>far, the best modern day version
    we have.  <BR> <BR>I know about the masters version, and I am eagerly <BR>waiting
    for it. But I fear it will not be much  <BR>different in terms of overall blandness.
    <BR> <BR>As far as I know, Monotype is working on a similar <BR>project involving
    Bembo. But it was meant to  <BR>appear this year and we are close to the end of
    <BR>it. So perhaps they abandoned the project.  <BR> <BR>Concerning leBe, I never
    really saw a good photo <BR>of it. But, as you say, in those days, there was <BR>no
    shortage of good designs.  <BR> <BR>As a matter of fact, it strikes me that most  <BR>typefaces
    are variations of the same basic idea. <BR>Of course Tory&#39;s faces are different
    from  <BR>Garamond&#39;s, but Garamond, leBe, COlinnes, all seem <BR>to base their
    work on the same design. <BR> <BR>I really think the proliferation of quite differ-
    <BR>ent typefaces is something that really began at <BR>the 20th century. Before
    that - say, in the 19th <BR>Century - all types were more or less close to <BR>the
    Didones; in the 17th Century most books look <BR>more or less the same: printing
    differences are <BR>more a matter of quality of type design and,  <BR>perhaps
    above all, of ink, paper, and pressing  <BR>quality than type design.  <BR> <BR>Concerning
    the particular type I illustrated, you <BR>are quite right: what seems to have
    happened is  <BR>that there was some confusion and many different <BR>designs
    were joined &#40;for instance, consider the <BR>variations on the [ o ]. Even
    the Ascendonica is <BR>heterogeneous. There are many examples of foreign <BR>gliphs
    - not in the example I have shown, <BR>perhaps, but throughout the book.  <BR>
    <BR>If I find something of interest I will post it. <BR>Old typography really
    is a fascinating matter. <BR> <BR>Thank you for the replies. <BR> <BR>Rodrigo'
