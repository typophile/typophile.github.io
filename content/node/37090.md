  body: 'My thoughts: either something geometric (circular o''s reflecting the bullseye)
    or something straight and sans-y. In that vein, try Hypatia Pro (available if
    you register for the new Adobe Creative Suite, but otherwise, I''m not sure),
    [[http://processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html|Klavika]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jan-fromm/camingo/|Camingo]],

    and [[http://www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html|Avenir Next]]. I would
    think of more, but it''s late where I am and sleep beckons.'
