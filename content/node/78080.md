  do you think about this?\r\n\r\nAvanti means forward in Italian (although my solution
  is not targeting the Italian market). \r\nI am thinking about using a superhero
  theme but I am not 100% sure.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6659.jpg]"

    instead of AVAnTICart?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about superhero: the idea is good,
    but the way it sounds is makes me feel uneasy and I don't think I would trust
    a company who had it in their tag line, but hey it's just me.\r\n\r\nWhat font
    did you use? I like the letter A!:-)\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    Same allusion, just less fanboy-ish.

- body: "If you're not the graphic designer creating this Avanti Cart logo, it's REALLY
    not cool to post the work in progress here. If you don't trust your designer,
    hire a different one, but you really shouldn't be asking random strangers on the
    internet to appraise his/her work. A designer is creating work based on your input
    and your company profile, so us random strangers can't judge fairly without knowing
    all the same information. \r\n\r\nThis forum is primarily for technical advice,
    but clearly, you're not doing the technical work. Just because there <b>are</b>
    professional, talented and experienced designers here doesn't mean there aren't
    also tons of totally uneducated wannabees here, too. I'd say it's about 30% pro,
    70% wannabee. Can you tell the difference? No offense, but I really doubt it.
    Design by committee is probably the #1 most destructive roadblock to creating
    effective design, and you're including the whole world in your \"committee.\"
    \ \r\n\r\nFurthermore, you don't own the copyrights to these designs, and by posting
    them here you're not only breaking the law, you're opening them up to being stolen.
    Designers often reuse rejected ideas on new projects; now, your designer can't
    do that. \r\n\r\nIf you were my client....I'd quit. "

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, <strong>I asked for permission before posting the
    logos public</strong>. It is not about trusting my designer. I just needed some
    more feedback before making an important decision and I thought this forum could
    help.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>A designer is creating work based on your input and your
    company profile, so us random strangers can't judge fairly without knowing all
    the same information.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSecond, I don't see why this is different
    if there's a designer posting the logos or the client. <strong>Does your opinion
    about the logos changes now what you know I'm not a designer?</strong>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Just
    because there are professional, talented and experienced designers here doesn't

    it's about 30% pro, 70% wannabee. Can you tell the difference?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nEven
    if I cannot tell the difference, doest that mean I should not be asking for input?
    Come on. Let me judge the feedback I get, it is not for you to worry about.\r\n\r\nMore
    feedback is welcomed. Thanks."

- body: " <em>Even if I cannot tell the difference, does that mean I should not be
    asking for input? </em>\r\n\r\nYes, that's exactly what it means. It's kinda like
    hiring a mechanic to fix your car, and then asking random people walking by if
    he should replace your brakes or not. Or hiring a guy to paint your house, then
    wandering into a supermarket and asking people if your hired painter should strip
    the old paint off, then ask the teenage florist which type of paint and brushes
    your professional painter should use. Then, go back to your painter and tell him
    what the florist thinks. Would you ever do that? \r\n\r\nAnd yes, the opinion
    of the logos <strong>DOES</strong> change knowing you're not the designer. A logo
    designer has already done all the homework and research in an attempt to visually
    communicate the client's message. The client hires a designer because they don't
    have this skill set --- they often think it's all about \"knowing how to draw
    using a computer\" and nothing more. \r\n\r\nSo, when a professional designer
    posts here looking for advice, they're looking for <strong>technical</strong>
    advice. Kerning issues? Message clear? Style match target market? When a client
    posts here looking for advice, they're looking for strangers to undercut their
    designer's decisions. \r\n\r\nSo, technically? Your designer is very skilled.
    The worst part of this logo is the tag line -- which I'm guessing <b>you</b> insisted
    on, and your designer tried to talk you out of it. So, my advice to you is to
    give your designer creative freedom and I'll bet the results will be even better.
    If your message isn't getting through, that's probably because you're not communicating
    it to your designer. We have no way to tell that here on a forum...."

- body: "Just to finish my first metaphor....\r\n\r\nIf you're not a mechanic, and
    you hired one but then asked a bunch of random strangers about fixing your brakes,
    do you think you'd be capable of judging which random stranger's feedback is worthy?
    No, probably not. If you knew how to fix brakes, you wouldn't need to hire a mechanic.
    Even if you did know (how to fix brakes) but still hired a mechanic to do the
    work, you'd know enough about cars to know the mechanic was fixing them correctly.
    \r\n\r\nThe mechanic asking for advice is totally different --- the mechanic knows
    which advice is valuable because he knows cars. Not only don't you know cars in
    this metaphor, mihaibrehar, you <strong>also</strong> don't know how truly little
    you ever knew about cars in the first place. \r\n\r\nAnd you're making your poor
    designer defend him/herself against every non-mechanic that happens to wander
    by, because you really don't know which advice is valid. If you knew, you wouldn't
    be asking on a forum. \r\n\r\n"

    you are wrong again. You make too many assumptions, like the one I did not ask
    for permission before posting.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>...they often think it's all
    about \"knowing how to draw using a computer\" and nothing more.</blockquote>\r\nAgain
    assumptions...\r\n\r\nAnd about your metaphors - while they are good - and you
    are missing the point. I really don't have the time to go on trolling and find
    a counter-methaphor. Your opinion about a work of art should be the same whether
    it's done by Picasso or by a stranger.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI will probably pick the
    last logo. The one before last looks too much like the Mini logo (the car). And
    this similarity, btw, was pointed out on a forum (where nobody had a problem with
    me being a client and not a designer).\r\n\r\nOh yeah, the tag line will be changed.
    It's not going to be in English anyway. That was more of a placeholder text.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nTrolling
    off, anyone got more feedback?"
