  how it's made, how it looks, blabla. What is your opinion about what should be in
  it? And which already excisting promotions do you think are good?\r\n\r\nI'm trying
  to make one for myself (more like a catalog but well designed), containing my font
  collection."

  body: "I recently designed the specimens for [[http://commercialtype.com|Commercial
    Type]]. \r\n\r\nYou can see them [[http://abiabiabi.com/index.php?/project/commercial-type-specimens/|here]],
    and you can download them all on the [[http://commercialtype.com|CT website]]\r\n\r\nThe
    grid was built to be easily adapted for a wide range of typeface styles (from
    Austin to Giorgio Sans to Guardian) while at the same time presenting each in
    a very reserved manner. I wanted the specimens to reference the plainspoken nature
    of late 19th century and early 20th century metal type specimens but with a very
    clean and modern edge. The specimens differ wildly in what they show for each
    typeface (compare [[http://commercialtype.com/typeface_images/giorgio/giorgio/Giorgio-family.pdf|Giorgio]]
    with [[http://commercialtype.com/typeface_images/guardian/guardian_agate_sans/Guardian_Agate_Sans-family.pdf|Guardian
    Agate Sans]] for instance).\r\n\r\nBut I see you are doing this for personal use,
    so it need not be as (overly?) extensive as the CT ones."
