  website? They are using it on the main page (http://www.urbanoutfitters.com) for
  the header and the secondary navigation, as well as on their blog (http://blog.urbanoutfitters.com/blog)
  in various places. It looks a bit like Planeta from Gestalten, but there are more
  alternates and a different lower case.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/urban_outfitters_sans_4745.jpg]"

  body: Priori is really close but the details are off just a touch. I wonder if it
    is a custom.

  body: I think it's custom or they're mixing different typefaces. The navigation
    on the home page and the secondary type on the sample above doesnt have the same
    lowercase a as the head in sample above (which does look like Priori) does. The
    blog seems to mix up typefaces, too -- "What's New" uses what looks like a Priori
    sans a yet has a very square h and s.

    but perhaps there is an alternate \"a\"?\r\n"
