I don't know if that's good or bad actually, since I would relish the opportunity to have/make something idiosyncratically Armenian! On the other hand, currency is not something I like to glorify...

* BTW, they also required a glyph for the Armenian "eternity" symbol, concerning which there is a gentle, hidden debate as to how many arms it should have...

Any clues when/whether Unicode will include it?

		<div class="commentbody">I was there about 36 hours* but it was very memorable nonetheless. A real city. Gray, no tourists, and half its population looks really good in tight jeans. And I remember the tea service in Hotel Sibir - wow. The opera is that large domed building, right? There was a lot of scaffolding around it (September, 2004). The Saturday we toured all the banks in the city. There was this one with a huge purple cat on it - later we realized it was a minx. The Sunday morning I figured we should hit the church; not the small ceremonial one on the main street, but the populist one a bit away from the center, next to a train station in a gully of sorts. It was quite immersive, and we drew some visual inspiration from the decorations inside. And then we had to get on our respective flights back home. I did spend just under 24 hours in Moscow though. I'd been there before (for a couple of days, four years prior), and I do adore its raciness, but it's really just another big European city - not Russian enough.

Ha! That church by the train station, is the one I got baptised in!

Truth to tell, there is't all that much to see in Novosibirsk aside from the opera house (they have a terrific troupe) and the zoo, as the city is only a little over 100 years old, and most of that grew as part of the war effort when factories were being moved away from the front lines. The people are nice though, way nicer then Muscovites ;D

Eh, sorry for getting this so far off topic.

Wow! :-)
Do you remember what it's called?

Gus, that's actually an extremely interesting question. Although the structure of the triskelion/eternity* can be considered "intuitive" enough to ascribe any similarity to coincidence (or a shared primordial "culture"), there are in fact some very strong visual similarities between the two cultures** that actually go well beyond that one symbol. This, in spite of the large geographic divide. Recently I heard an explanation of why that's the case, but I don't remember what it was, and I have a feeling it was apocryphal anyway.

* BTW, just like the Nazis "repurposed" the swastika, the apartheid organization of Terreblanche in South Africa uses a triskelion!

** Another culture that looks Armenian (or vice versa) is the Basque, along with its environs. I was in Banaguás once (a hamlet near Jaca, in Aragon) and the local church looked faintly but clearly Armenian to me. Actually the Basque <em>language</em> and from what I understand even the genotype seem related to us!

There's this one khatchkar in a very impressive (if run-down) church complex in the town of Talin (close to the Turkish border) that I saw this summer, with all the Celtic knot-work and everything! I'll try to find my photo of it (actually Nina was there too, and she takes better pictures). Pretty amazing.

What do you guys think, would it be smarter to just use this for the Armenian eternity symbol, or to lobby the Consortium to give it its own code point? The main Armenian block does still have 10 empty slots, plus the symbol above might not be a good match neither in expected look nor assumed function*. I just never like the idea of submitting proposals to large organizations, pleading for attention, and then waiting for who knows how long. On the other hand, if there's a Unicode proposal in the works for the Dram maybe this can piggy-back?

* In fact I can't tell if it's really supposed to be U+2300, or U+2318.

To think of catching one of the 2300 codepoints here is high nonsense. If you must  pinch a codepoint then serve yourself in the – otherwise senseless – 2700 block.

<cite>I just never like the idea of submitting proposals to large organizations, pleading for attention…</cite> … because it’s too laborious (?).
If you can well document the sign’s usage in connection with *text* (any liturgical books from the past –?) than a proposal to ISO/UTC will perform almost automatically. Epigraphical samples usually count as much as nothing.

Yes, but in some cases -such as Afhgani and Khmer- a
nation's currency has ended up in its alphabetic block.

		<div class="commentbody">Dear John,
I highly appreciate your business as it benefits to communication through letters and characters :)
Your (or anybody's else)idea about inclusion of monetary symbols within alphabetic block seems to be really helpful for the font designers. However, there are some considerations, which I'd like to present here.

First, the monetary symbols belong to the block of simbols performing one-and-the-same function; otherwise anybody looking for the set of those symbols has to search through the whole Unicode and the alphabetic blocks of the world nations, which doesn't make sense. For instance, I could miss Afhgani and Khmer monetary symbols if not hitting upon them at this forum.

On the other hand, the number of font designers are limited, and for their good it is better to contact the countries' institutions/developers to which they'd like to benefit to. Finally, there are state institutions, who are ISO members and make their official votes at Unicode.

Best regards,

A currency symbols should be "next to" the numerals used with it. So for a script that uses its own numerals the symbol should be in its own codepage; but for scripts that use Latin/Arabic numerals the symbol should be with all the others that do that. Is that too ghetto?

What hits *me* much more is the design issue. We have seen several new monetary signs born during the last few years. Most recent: Indian Rupee, Armenian Dram. 

For me as a font designer the challenge is:
a) to make the glyph harmonizing with the writing system it is related to;
b) to make the glyph suitable to the ﬁgures it will get used with;
c) to make the glyph fitting to the existing set of international currency signs it will be competing with;
d) to equally manage a) to c).

That is quite a task, isn’t it?

Do you mean there's not enough room for all such symbols? That's certainly true; so we have to be picky.

I'm not really opposed to having the Armenian Eternity sign in Unicode, I just wouldn't want to see people dumping everything in there.

		<div class="commentbody">In ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2 N4156, SARM, the Armenian National Institute of Standards made in its comments a request for the encoding of the Armenian Eternity Sign.

Armenia is not a P-Member of the Subcommittee responsible for the Universal Character Set, and their comments did not include the Proposal Summary Form and so unless a proper proposal is made then the only thing that the committee will do is say "Noted".

I am putting together a proposal. There is VERY LITTLE TIME.

Please, please, please. Do <em>any</em> of you have examples of this symbol used <strong>in text</strong>? It is no good to say that it is used to organize paragraphs. That is just a rumour without some sort of evidence.

Also it appears from the SARM comment that two will be needed, right-facing and left-facing. They did explain a particular usage scenario: "Right and left rotations have accordingly active and passive meanings, as in case of Swastika, and are used in order to accentuate these meanings. For example, a cradle for а boy is decorated with the right whirling eternity sign and a cradle for а girl with the left whirling eternity sign."

We do have RIGHT-FACING SVASTI SIGN and LEFT-FACING SVASTI SIGN so I would see little problem in having RIGHT-FACING ARMENIAN ETERNITY SIGN and LEFT-FACING ARMENIAN ETERNITY SIGN.

Every few years I see people complaining that this isn't in Unicode. Every few years I make a plea like this. Evidence, folks, please?</div>

well, generally looks ok, however let me think about spasing/kerning.
On http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_dram_sign there are the samples of my first attempts to shape it.</div>

Instead of encoding these in the Armenian block at U+05BD and U+05BE, the committee suggested encoding these in Plane 1, in the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs block, at U+1F53E and U+1F53F. 

I have written to SARM to ask whether this allocation is OK with them, or if they prefer them to be encoded in the Armenian block itself. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Clearly I think the ones in Ernestine and Nour&Patria are good models.  :-)
The one in the Unicode PDF isn't (the bars are sitting too high).

Structurally, the "normal" way to do it is to take U+0534,
take off the rightward protrusion off the stem, and add
two bars crossing the stem; the bars might go further to
the left than the right. BTW, in a text font you're unlikely
to be able to get away with using a single bar because of
the character's proximity to U+0534 (although context
would resolve any ambiguity 99% of the time).

BTW, more like a pint!
