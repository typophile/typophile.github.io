  be a tough one.\r\n\r\nI'm specifically looking for the numbers on the dial. The
  main things that seem to be unique are:\r\n\r\n1. No (terminal?) on the 1, it's
  just a straight line. Could use an uppercase i if needbe.\r\n2. The 0 is sort of
  square with rounded corners.\r\n3. The 4 is open (what's the term for this?)\r\n\r\nPls
  help! :("

    Refrigerator, Agency.
