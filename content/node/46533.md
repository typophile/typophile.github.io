    \r\n\r\nF2F OCR Alexczyk\r\n\r\n\r\nbut am totally foxed with the Y. The top edge
    turns vertical which none of the above fonts do... \r\n\r\n--\r\narjun"

  body: He has been known to draw his own letters. No reason he couldn't make his
    own font. But I think this has come up here before, maybe without an answer.

  body: "Jaysus I thought this would be an open and shut case. It's certainly not
    Arial Mono, as Arjun pointed out the leg of R turns vertical, and the X is the
    same (although it's not in my sample). Another give-away is the leg on the G.
    This may well be Sagmeisters own creation as Stephen pointed out. I know for a
    fact that it this is a fully functioning (possibly upercase only) font as he was
    using it in a presentation he gave in Dublin about a week ago. \r\n\r\nSomebody
    must know more...!\r\n\r\nHere's another sample to help:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thingsihavelearned_poster_5980.jpg]"

    when this came up before.

    had been under the impression from a conversation I had with another Typophile
    member who will remain nameless! That this was not Lutz, I trusted his judgement
    and didnt bother to check!\r\n\r\nStephen/Jan or whoever, where do you think the
    letters have been modified?"

  body: "My guess is a custom font from Mr Windlin.\r\n\r\nClosest to Lutz, including
    all the numbers, with I, R, V from Alpha, J a mix of the two, and G from somewhere
    else!\r\n\r\nI wonder if there'a a clue on the lineto website:\r\n\r\n<cite>Lutz
    Headline isn\u2019t exactly a \xABNew Release\xBB - it had been a favourite on
    the former incarnation of Lineto ever since its inception in 1998. When relaunching
    in the spring of 2004, the font was pulled from the library, overhauled slightly
    and is now being re-issued due to popular demand.\r\nLike Alpha Headline, this
    headline typeface is derived from an anonymous design still in use today for the
    production of car registration plates in the United Kingdom.</cite>\r\n\r\nCould
    it be this original version of Lutz? (It isn't very similar to UK plates, Alpha
    in its entirety is much closer)."

  body: "what's interesting is that he uses different versions of the same letter
    in different parts of the book \u2013 for example the 'i' in 'in my life' is different
    to the 'i' in 'stefan sagmeister', yet the typeface on the whole is the same.
    One 'i' has slabs on top and bottom (not sure if that's the best way of describing
    it but hopefully you get what I mean) whereas the other doesn't."
