  an Opentype font (Type1 flavour) in AICS2 and export it to a pdf.\r\nWhen i check
  the fonts in acrobat they are presented (or converted) to a Type1.\r\nSo the font
  is using the type1 icon and not the opentype icon. I saw pdf's before with opentype
  fonts / using the opentype icon. Why is that?\r\n\r\nthx,\r\nSteven"

  body: "</cite></i></em></cite></i></em>\r\nYou asked the same question in the Adobe
    user forums, and I answered it there.  :)\r\n\r\nIn some senses, it's the other
    way around: Type 1 is stored more like OpenType in PDF. \r\n\r\nPDF uses CFF (Compact
    Font Format) with Type 2 charstrings as a lossless compression for Type 1 fonts.
    When OpenType was created, Adobe adopted the then-new CFF approach for handling
    Type 1 outlines (entire fonts really) within OpenType. The other OpenType tables
    are in addition to the CFF portion of the font. \r\n\r\nSo in PDF, when Acrobat
    reports fonts as being \"Type 1,\" they are actually CFF - just like that portion
    of OpenType CFF fonts. \r\n\r\nMore recently, PDF has added the capability to
    store additional OpenType layout tables as well. However, this facility has been
    little-used to date, AFAIK. \r\n\r\nCheers, \r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: "Thomas, would I be correct in assuming your last point indicates that it's
    a good idea to use Adobe's naming system for features, eg \"Asmall\" rather than
    \"A.smcp\" or \"A.sc\", and \"threeinferior\" rather than \"three.inf\"?\r\n\r\nI
    note that these are the default names in FontLab 5's \"Adobe OT PS standard names
    (CFF)\" code page (Names mode)."
