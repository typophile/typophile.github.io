    G\" like  this on serif fonts, such as Ronaldson http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/
    and more extreme versions -- smaller & more protruding with tiny serifs --  but
    I haven't found a digital version yet.\r\nDon"

  body: "As far as I can determine  there is no matching digital or metal font for
    this lettering.\r\nLooking at the font as a whole, the closest digital match --
    including tricky letters like _S_ and _R_ -- is Neuzeit S Heavy based on Stempel
    Sans Bold or Neuzeit Grotesque,  by Wilhelm Pischner in 1928, which by coincidence
    is the date used in your sample. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/NeuzeitSHeavyUC_6170.jpg]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neuzeit-s/\r\nNeuzeit S Heavy could serve
    as the inspiration for someone wishing to create letters that match the G.W.R.
    stencil. Remove the serif from _G_ and make some boxing at the lower terminal.
    Or, simply add the boxing at the lower terminal of _C_. Compress _W_, and perhaps
    do a minor compression of _M_.  Other minor changes. Cut for stencil effect.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "I should mention that the metal type version of Stempel Sans Bold was a geometric
    design and thus the letter contours were very close to what the GWR draftsmen
    drew. When the font was digitized, as Neuzeit S Heavy, this discipline was relaxed
    to incorporate some of the flavor of the grotesque/humanist style. \r\nFor a pure
    geometric, compare the digital Neuzeit S Heavy with Intro Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/IntroBoldUC_4361.jpg]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/intro/ Not all letters match, but the
    geometric contours of letters such as _S_, _C_ and _G_ match very closely with
    the GWR stencil.\r\nDon"

  body: Thank you Don - Pischner's Neuzeit S is a good looking typeface. Someone mentioned
    Arston stencil - [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/applyinteractive/arston-stencil/]]
    but it has a different "feel" I think (I don't know typography words to describe
    this feeling!).

  body: "Perhaps crisp and regular for Neuzeit S and Intro vs somewhat boxy for Arston
    -- which is like a toned down Meilor with its super-ellipses in place of a circles.
    Also Arston is wider for the non-curved letters like _H_ and _K_. But there is
    certainly a subjective element. I also prefer Pischner's Neuzeit S  to the others,
    with the possible exception of _S_, where I incline towards Intro.\r\nDon"
