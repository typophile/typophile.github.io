  body: Such tools are mostly &#34;inhouse&#34; stuff of software firms like game
    producers. I had done a gfx project for such a firm. Most of their tools were
    internal tools. A part of this was a font to bitmap/sprite converter able of converting
    every Type1/TTF font into bitmaps, sprites for using in Games and so on.

  body: 'Do they do this by simply getting the OS to render the font and grabbing
    the results?&#42; So this means grayscale would work fine for example, no? This
    is nice because in cases where Windows can render a grayscale &#40;or even regular&#41;
    bitmap font and MacOS can&#39;t &#40;something increasingly common&#41;, you could
    make a movie using Director/Windows and it would still work OK on Macs. And this
    brings to mind another question, which by now might be answerable by somebody
    here: Flash MX2004 can do this type of rendering internally &#40;whereas before
    it couldn&#39;t handle bitmap fonts at all - only pixelfonts&#41;. But according
    to Mark&#42;&#42; it didn&#39;t work with grayscale on MacOS. My question is,
    if you use the Windows version of Flash MX2004, will the resultant movies actually
    work on Macs too? <BR> <BR>&#42; Like Pyrus&#39;s FONMaker? <BR>&#42;&#42; <a

  body: And the legal aspects? My guess is that the resulting bitmap font would be
    considered a derivative font by most EULA&#39;s and a such could not be redistributed
    &#40;or in some cases made at all&#41; without acquiring additional rights from
    the font&#39;s creator.

  body: But are bitmap fonts protected in any shape or form anyway? <BR>It seems like
    a gray area, but tending very strongly towards unprosecutability. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: You&#39;re probably right. I think the type designer&#39;s only claim would
    be based on the user breaking the EULA, at least in the US.   <BR> <BR>

  body: I guess claiming that the user has broken the EULA would be difficult. First
    of all, you need to consider what the substance of a given EULA is. Often, it
    defines the object of licensing as &#34;font software&#34;. The rendered bitmaps
    are usually product of such &#34;font software&#34;. Bitmaps fonts derived from
    the rendered bitmaps are by no means font software, and if at all, they&#39;re
    being derived from the output of the font software, not from the font software
    itself.  <BR>Adam

  body: I believe this is the argument Bitstream originally used to say that TrueDoc
    didn&#39;t need to respect embedding permissions. Because they were simply asking
    the OS for glyphs at a given size and then packaging the results as a portable
    font resource &#40;PFR&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think you&#39;d have a strong case for
    claiming that this particular tool is simply a font conversion tool - and that
    it&#39;s converting an outline font into a bitmap font. Although some EULAs allow
    for such conversion, few allow the derivative font to be distributed or bundled
    as part of a software product.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to hear how type designers
    feel about this. Do they feel it is okay for a games publisher &#40;for example&#41;
    to ship a bitmap version of their fonts without acquiring additional rights? <BR>
    <BR>Cheers, Si <BR>

  body: Simon, I see your point - and certainly gauging the feelings of type designers
    about this is useful. <BR> <BR>Pragmatically I might say that this is a great
    reason to include bitmaps in your fonts! Since what they swipe is basically exactly
    what you made, as opposed to something the &#34;faceless&#34; OS is merely spewing
    out. That defense might hold up adequately in the court of public opinion, although
    in the legal realm it might become a matter of who has the bigger lawyer. <BR>
