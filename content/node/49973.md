body: "I work in-house for a water-ski company that is positioning itself as High-End.
  I'm working on the annual Product catalog and wondering if anyone has any insight
  besides the usual suspects for header and body and combos. I've been looking at
  some higher-end car brochures like Mercedes and Audi for inspiration. Lots of Helvetica
  sprinkled with a little Franklin Gothic. Nothing against either but maybe somebody
  has some other ideas.\r\n\r\nThanks!!!\r\n\r\nBilly"

  body: "I've been wanting a good reason to try Meta Serif. I think the key to so-called
    high end design is it leans heavily on the information design aesthetic. \r\n\r\nYou
    could also go for something a little more obvious. Just as good mind you. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/features/newsletters/jun2006_b/\">Soul
