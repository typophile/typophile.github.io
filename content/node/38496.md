  buy the \"The Elements of Typographic Style\".\r\nBut in a search I found this 2
  books that look very complet. But since you guys are \"the pros\", I dn't want to
  spend my few euros in weak books...\r\nSo, are this books about type good?\r\n\r\nGrid
  Systems: Principles of Organizing Type by Kimberly Elam\r\nExploring Typography
  by Tova Rabinowitz\r\n\r\nOr better books?\r\nI want to (start?) develop my learnings
  the wonderfull world of typography\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

  body: "Elam\u2019s book on grid systems is excellent, but not worth much on it\u2019s
    own as it explores how objects function within grids without really explaining
    the geometry that goes into really building good grids in the first place. The
    Rabinowitz book is a textbook in a traditional sense. It is a long survey of typography
    covering everything from font history to page layout to font design. All of the
    text is very dumbed-down, but I find that to be the strong point of the book,
    because it has none of the excesses and pretense that clutter up most of the books
    in this category, particularly those easily purchased in the United States. The
    downside is that, being a mass-market textbook, the design is just plain ugly
    and a segue of some sort is randomly assorted into every chapter. It also wastes
    a tremendous amount of space on specimens of the same common typefaces that get
    shown in one typography book after another. \r\n\r\nThe two books would actually
    make a pretty good pair. "

    have one exception?) to my general rule of never buying a book whose title includes

    got this book in on Friday, and have read over half of it so far, and find it
    a great resource, probably on a par with Bringhurst. It is not as much logo as
    lettering, and font design is included in the latter. "
