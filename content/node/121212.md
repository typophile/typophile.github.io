body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nCan anyone recognize the font in this logo? Whatthefont suggests
  Ela Sans, and it does look very similar, but not quite (e.g. the font in logo looks
  more like a serif, the relative length of horizontal lines in E is different, the
  shape of R is different etc). "

  body: "The original must be <strong>Basilea</strong> a font designed by Markus Low
    at 1965.\r\nThe closer digital I can find to your sample is an old <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Image-Club-Graphics%20%2F%20%28Commercial%29&ffam=Basilea%20-%20Regular&fid=750338b9fdf4307825b960f9cbf562d1&fsize=60&text=SWINBURNE%20UNIVERSITY%20OF%20TECHNOLOGY&wrap=2|Basilea]]</strong>
    version by Image Club Graphics [1992] but it's probably not available anymore.\r\n\r\nIt
    was also digitized by OPTI Castcraft as <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=OPTI-Castcraft%20%2F%20%28Freemium%29&ffam=OPTISusan%20-%20Regular&fid=fdd1d3df5110e540841a7e55a9514c8c&fsize=48&text=SWINBURNE%20UNIVERSITY%20OF%20TECHNOLOGY&wrap=2|OPTI
    Susan]]</strong> but you must be very careful when using OPTI orphan fonts in
    a commercial project (OPTI is a defunct company and almost all of their fonts
    were clones of other designs).\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was also <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Letterhead%20%2F%20%28Commercial%29&ffam=Kellie%20Ann%20LHF%20-%20Normal&fid=9bd752d5bbfcef03aa6a6a7e64acf6de&fsize=60&text=SWINBURNE%20UNIVERSITY%20OF%20TECHNOLOGY&wrap=2|Kellie
    Ann LHF]]</strong> by Letterhead Fonts [2002] but I can't find it anymore in their
    official site.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/markus-low/|Markus
    Low]]</strong> by Jonathan Hill [The Northern Block, 2010] a font named after
    the original designer, which is available, but it's not so close to your sample."

    I''m not sure about the legitimacy of those. '
