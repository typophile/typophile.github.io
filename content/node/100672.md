  Sheep, Spiekermann uses red for type in the sidebars. i believe the thinking goes,
  it's ok to use pure hues when there's only a small amount of text.\r\n\r\ndoing
  testing, contrast is important -- if there's not enough, it's hard to read, thus
  black on white is good for this reason.\r\n\r\nBut is black on white an artefact
  of the printing press? color paper being more expensive, so white -- or off-white
  -- paper is often used for cost reasons?\r\n\r\nthe Financial Times is counter to
  this. they print on salmon pink stock, with black text. and it needs to be readable
  -- there's dense information with stock prices.\r\n\r\nModernist posters are another
  example, with an array of colors: both text and background. but this is a different
  situation. it's larger display type. i'm thinking specifically for long form writing,
  blog posts, books, and magazines."

    it\u2019s mainly about light and dark, not colour v. colour even though human
    vision is so centred on colour.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m reading a book at the moment where
    each chapter has a different colour for the title and some related text, many
    of the colours picked are strong enough that legibility even at around 14pt is
    fine but they went far too light in a few cases and it\u2019s a struggle to read.\r\n\r\nA
    general observation I\u2019ve made over the years: yellow text on white is rarely
    a good thing. It can work for headings, especially with a blocky face and a darker
    yellow, but a light yellow like a single pass of process yellow can make type
    that\u2019s incredibly hard to see properly much less read."

    using spot colors on printed materials will give superior results rather than
    using screen tints. (So for example gray type would ideally be printed with solid
    gray ink, rather than as a screen tint of black.) But when type is viewed on a
    computer monitor you're working with a totally different process, and its simply
    not going to be a sharp as text from a printing press. You just need to look at
    it onscreen and use your own judgement."
