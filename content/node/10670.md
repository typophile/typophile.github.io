  body: smc <BR> <BR>Some very good things there, but its Goudy. He&#39;s lost some
    percentages over the years. One of my favorite examples of just how tight can
    you space a line and still make out the individual words. Probably worth $40 just
    for that. <BR> <BR>But the first edition would actually be worth quite a bit.
    If you have the Dover paperback, yeah, you paid a bit too much maybe. Check Abe.com
    to compare prices on this.
