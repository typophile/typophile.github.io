  body: Stephen, I think you're right about Tahoma (still [[squooshed]]). I didn't
    realise how similar Tahoma/Verdana were, it was a bit like "oh so that's what
    Tahoma/Verdana looks like above 12px." I've never really seen them up large nor
    in print. :^)

  body: "Matthew designed Verdana, Tahoma, and Nina to be very much alike. They are
    essentially the same family in different widths.\r\n\r\nFunny/Sad aside: <a href=\"http://patelco.com\">my
    credit union</a> uses Verdana for their <em>logo</em>!"
