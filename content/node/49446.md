  the real world floats magically over a clean white background. Stop Photoshopping
  every damned thing you can into a silhouette. Just because you know how to create
  a mask with the pen tool and tweak it with your Wacom tablet doesn\u2019t mean you
  should. Tell the client to stop being a cheapass and hire a Photographer to shoot
  against something interesting."
