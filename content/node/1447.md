  body: ok so please forgive me for bringing this one back up.  I thought I knew what
    the lower font was but seems I was incorrect.  I cant find one that has the correct
    G R &amp; C.  If one or two match the third doesnt. <BR> <BR>thanks again <IMG

    go. Why shouldn&#39;t the same thing happen to Futura? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
