  body: It looks like it&#39;s based on an old metal/wood  <BR>typeface called Hellenic
    Wide or Antique Extended.  <BR>See the links in <A HREF="http://curbcontrol.com/interview/bob_dahlquist/"
    TARGET="_top">this interview</A> with Bob Dahlquist. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a free
    version by Pelle Piano called  <BR>Stereo and a very good revival by the Letterror  <BR>boys
    called <A HREF="http://www.letterror.com/foundry/zapata/index.html" TARGET="_top">Zapata</A>.
    Also, see Aboutype&#39;s <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily28396.html"

  body: ' Thanks for the prompt response, Stephen. I&#39;ve checked Stereo and Zapata
    and they are not quite there yet. And unless it&#39;s retouched it&#39;s not Antique
    Central either. Bob Dahlquist&#39;s version &#40;great link, btw&#41; looks very
    similar but do you know if it is commercially available? <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot
    for your help, I&#39;ve been after this face ever since I first saw it in the
    &#34;stereo&#34; logo on an old album cover. <BR> <BR>Jesus '

    You might try contacting them if you think it&#39;s a match. <BR> <BR>Toad. '

  body: I think it&#39;s Hellenic Wide. It&#39;s an old metal typeface from the Bauer
    foundry. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s available as a digital font.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;I scanned and traced a few of the letters for the <A HREF="http://www.typecon2003.com/"

    for letterpress. Very exciting. Chip Schilling at the Indulgence Press in Minneapolis
    did a great job on the printing. '
