  body: I believe it's Bodoni, but I will let you investigate exactly which versions
    would fit best. There are many, and in this case, you may not find an exact match
    with the digital fonts available vs the printed sample you have.

  body: "Ok. Thanks. That was actually the first one I tried. I think the bold weight
    is right for most of it but it's not nearly big enough for \"BOXING.\" \r\n\r\nThanks
    again. \r\n\r\n"
