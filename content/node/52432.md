body: How do you draw the letter "o"? Do you create shapes with the oval tool? Do
  you set up guides to get the curves even on both sides? How is your process?

  body: Usually draw most of my letters by hand (yeah, with a pencil!), and then trace
    them. Same goes for the o. :)

  body: "Sometimes I'll start with a C and cut it vertically, then duplicate and rotate
    the closed half 180\xB0 and stitch it together, but that doesn't always work.\r\n\r\nI
    do similarly for the S, except I cut the C horizontally and flip the bottom half.\r\n\r\nThese
    are, of course very early conceptual steps. A lot of tweaking goes on after that."

  body: I often start with the oval tool, and then use a combination of scaling the
    top+bottom nodes horizontally, and scale the side nodes vertically, to get the
    shape I want. This has the effect of adjusting all the top/bottom handles or the
    side handles simultaneously.

  body: "First I rub it with me paws, then I draw a couple of elipses and, using the
    larger one as the outside curve and the smaller one as the counter, manipulate
    the nodes at extrema until I get approximately the inside and outside shapes I
    want.\r\n\r\nMostly it's about what I want, and when it looks rite. Measuring
    things is for the ducks. Only ducks measure things. I find that gets in the way
    of what I want. Art is what the eye wants to see. If I measured the width of the
    vertical stroke of the <strong>o</strong> and found out it was actually four units
    narrower than the mean vertical stroke width of the stem letters <em>but the <strong>o</strong>
    looks rite anyway</em>, the ruler is going to lose and I won't be using it as
    a tool again very soon.\r\n\r\nWhen it looks rite.\r\n\r\nSometimes I add more
    nodes in between the extrema nodes and mess around with those for a while, steadily
    working towards what I want. Usually I'm drawing <strong>o</strong> after I'm
    happy with <strong>h n u m i l a e</strong> and maybe a few others in the lower
    case, so I'm matching <strong>o</strong> to those guys.\r\n\r\nWhen I've got the
    <strong>o</strong> I want I place nodes at extrema and remove the nodes not at
    extrema if the nodes at extrema will hold the desired shape(s). Sometimes the
    shape(s) require a few extra nodes to be left in place.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
