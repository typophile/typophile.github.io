  body: And for something with a bit more personality, you could also go with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bernhard/bold-condensed/testdrive.html?s=black%2Bbear&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Bernhard Bold Condensed</a>. &#40;Note the slight difference in
    the spelling.&#41;

  body: 'No it isn&#39;t, Josep. A distinctive feature of Lo-Type&#39;s  <BR>lc &#34;a&#34;
    is the top of the bowl that comes back down  <BR>when joining the stem, whereas
    Bernard Condensed&#39;s  <BR>curves upwards at the join. Furthermore, Lo-Type
    is  <BR>a lot more wobbly and curly than the sample: the top  <BR>arm of the lc
    &#34;k&#34; for example is quite telling: it&#39;s very  <BR>rounded and the top
    serif is curly and pear shaped. <BR> <BR>BTW Talk about a useless site &#40;Berthold&#39;s&#41;:
    small,  <BR>incomplete samples and no possiblity to test drive.'

  body: I appreciate it, guys.  You know, for someone who&#39;s new to the world of
    typography, this is pretty impressive.  You seem to have the ability to pull the
    most obscure font names out of the depths of your subconscious. Very cool.
