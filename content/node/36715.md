  I remember the font from other books in the 1970s. Can anyone tell me if it's available
  these days? I've tried myfonts to no avail. Thanks."

    target=\"_blank\">Dieter Steffmann's Herkules</a>. The download link says T1,
    but there's an Opentype font in the download as well.\r\n\r\nIt was also available
    from Opti as Huk Light."

  body: Gosh! That was very quick! Thank you. Unfortunately the contours are very
    messy, but thanks anyway because it is better than starting from scratch for this
    font. I guess there's no commercial version. Thanks.

    is the only vendor for these fonts these days and good luck trying to deal with
    them. Also, the fonts were made ages ago (in computer time) so I don't know about
    quality there either.

  body: Thank you. I'll see how well I can smooth out the bumps and make the first
    one useable.
