body: Hi, I'm doing some scripting with fonts and it just so happens that in the conversion,
  the glyph names will be the same as the unicode names, I've found that this seems
  to be okay (i.e. /a/ will be called uni0061 instead). Are they only for human-reabable
  purposes, or do they need to be the specific name that corresponds to the unicode
  number?

  body: "My interest in this issue has recently been rekindled, so I'd like to followup
    with some questions.\r\n\r\n1) The link above is to Thomas Phinney's suggestion
    that glyph names are important for glyph-to-Unicode mapping in certain PDF work
    flows. I have heard elsewhere that extracting text from PDF using glyph-to-Unicode
    mapping isn't all that reliable anyway -- especially for complex scripts. Can
    anyone comment on the reliability and accuracy of this mechanism?\r\n\r\n2) Other
    than the above-mentioned PDF issue, are there any reasons that ttf-flavored OpenType
    fonts need glyph names at all? Said another way, what would break if all my fonts
    had format-3 post tables?\r\n\r\nAccording to the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm|post
    table spec]] regarding format 3:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThe printing behavior of this
    version on PostScript printers is unspecified, except that it should not result
    in a fatal or unrecoverable error. Some drivers may print nothing, other drivers
    may attempt to print using a default naming scheme.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nwhich
    seems to suggest there can be printing problems. But then  [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm|Microsoft's
    recommendations]] later state:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nOpenType fonts containing CFF
    outlines use only format 3.0 of the 'post' table.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nso I'm getting
    mixed messages here.\r\n\r\nWhy the question? The growing use of webfonts makes
    font size an issue again, and thus omitting glyph names can improve performance.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for any help.\r\n\r\nPS: I know that glyph names are useful during development,
    e.g., for writing OT and Graphite feature code. My question relates to the final
    product, not the development process."

      it is good as long as no one to many substitutions or glyph reordering are involved.
      Also there should be strict one to one or many to one maapings between input
      characters and glyphs, e.g. if you have both <code>smcp</code> and <code>c2sc</code>
      features, there must be two smallcap glyph sets, one a.sc, \u2026, z.sc and
      one A.sc, \u2026, Z.sc respictively.\r\n\r\n<cite>Said another way, what would

          of type 2 (\"multiple\")\u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nYes. Generally you can reverse
          map a single glyph to a single or multiple characters, but you can\u2019t
          reverse map multiple glyphs to a single character. The exact algorithm used
          is described in [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html#2|Adobe
          Glyph Naming convention]].\r\n\r\n<cite>Does this includes character-level

          the output of the reverse mapping will be in the order of the glyphs, any
          recording that affects the final glyph order will a;so affect the reverse
          mapping (except for RTL swapping, though some applications fail with that
          too and return reverse mapped text in the visual not the logical order)."

    the reverse mapping</blockquote>\r\n\r\nRight. It is tempting to think that it
    might be possible to reverse reordering once one has the character identities
    of the glyph string, but in practice this fails in a number of ways, influenced
    by how the font has been built. It isn't unusual for post-reordering GSUB features
    to produce ligatures of glyphs that represent characters that are not sequential
    in the pre-reordered string. Adobe's glyph naming conventions do not cater for
    this.\r\n\r\nI think it would be possible to define glyph name conventions and
    rules for making Indic fonts that would make it possible to cleanly reverse reordering
    from parsed character strings, but I doubt if that would get much traction."

      what will break if the glyphs have names that are well-formed but are not names
      that are included in the [[http://sourceforge.net/adobe/aglfn/wiki/AGL%20Specification/|Adobe
      Glyph List Specification]]?\r\n\r\nI am acquainted with AGL and AGLFN, and our
      policy is to conform to AGLFN when the font is shipped. (During development
      we may use non-AGL names, but those are replaced prior to shipping). But I am
      having an ongoing discussion with someone who dislikes the Adobe names and chooses
      to ignore the AGL conventions.  Is there any risk to his behaviour?"

    inquired as to when this was fixed.\r\n\r\nAs for problems today, the main one
    remains the classic: if a PostScript print stream or file is created, and then
    turned into PDF without the original font available, then glyph names are the
    only means to get the encoding from the print stream. If the font uses unrecognized
    glyph names, then the text in the resulting PDF will not be searchable, copyable,
    etcetera."
