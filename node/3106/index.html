  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">For a very long time now I have been a great lover of magazines.* Upon  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->entering design school I obviously had new reasons (and excuses) to continue  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with this obsession, or if you like, fetish. Over the years since I have  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->witnessed great magazines and/or great design, come and go with the tides.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember <em>Interview</em> when Tibor Kalman was in charge? It was an amazing  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->example of great magazine design. And what of <em>Rolling Stone</em> before  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Photoshop and Illustrator made some things too easy? Or <em>Vogue</em> during the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->height of Supermodeldom? Not to mention anything that Fabian Baron touched,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or so it seemed, in the nineties? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps my references show my love of a more traditional time, but I really  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have many questions and I'll wager others would like to hear a serious  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->discussion about magazine design and typography. And perhaps while we're at  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it we could list out favorites and least favorites. In view of the forum we  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are on the list should include both creative director and the typefaces  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->used.** This discussion, or my guilt, are born out of two recent redesigns  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and one wish for involvement in a redesign. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, <em>Harper's Bazaar</em>. I love the magazine, I love Didot, but &hellip; *** <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Second, <em>Fast Company</em>. I only just recv'd this issue in the mail today, but  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ty' fa is gone  The design IMO is still strong, the content not gotten weak.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suppose when I saw the flag I was a little depressed. I like it, in an of  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->itself, but there are so many business magazines with sans serif screaming  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->from the top. I suppose I should hold judgement until I go the bookstore and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->see for myself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last, what ever happened to <em>Vogue</em>? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->QUESTION:  Do type foundries ever approach publication houses with the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->desire to change the look? Or is this considered arrogant? Is it any more  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->arrogant than a design studio approaching them? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*It is an addiction I picked up very early on in my life starting with my  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stacks of <em>Seventeen</em>. ** Perhaps a pattern could be shown? *** The word I  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have in mind is overkill.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, you had a wonderful idea, starting a magazine design discussion! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I share with you a chronic case of M.A. (Magazine Addiction). Living in Milan, Italy, I have easy access to almost all American and European magazines. Being not only a magaholic, but a graphic designer also, I especially buy design publications, but also quite a few &quot;lifestyle&quot; magazines (and many more, not on a regular basis). After a few years of working mostly on web sites (I still work for the italian office of one of those very large - and very, very worried - web consultancy firms) I decided to get back to my first love, print, only this time I want to do things on my own terms. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, with the help of a journalist friend, I am currently working on my first magazine design project (a new title that we're starting from scratch and - hopefully - one day eventually publish, if we find the right financial backing). We plan to create a dummy issue and then show it around. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I will gladly participate in this discussion. I am currently asking myself so many magazine design questions working on this project, so I think it will be great to share my opinions with you guys! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My flat has always been packed with old/new magazines, but as you can imagine, now that I am working on one, it's even worse. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, regarding your first posting: I also have fond memories for Baron, Woodward and Kalman at their creative peaks, and I rate their work like some of the best magazine design ever.It is still fresh today, which is NOT what could be said of a certain other magazine art director/surfer who once believed to be god and has currently been sucked in a black hole, apparently. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Are you guys aware of the work of Fernando Gutierrez, the spanish creative director behind Vanidad, Matador, Tentaciones and who is currently designing Colors Magazine? His work is fantastic, maybe you saw a great article about him on a not-so-recent issue of Eye Magazine? What do you guys think of him? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ciao a tutti, from Milan.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">bj, I can only sympathize with you. It's not simply an obsession, it definitely is an illness. And it provokes alarming reactions in other people. What about the puzzled looks of non-designer friends (not to mention partners) when you keep on ranting about that spread in Matador or the effectiveness of Champion Gothic in Woodward's issues of Rolling Stone? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh, and even more frustrating: try to utter the word BRODOVITCH to a bunch of snowboard-obsessed &quot;new media&quot; designers like I did once at work! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Talking of favorites, here's another one: Vince Frost, for his covers of The Independent's supplement and his work on Big Magazine. Beautiful. Is this guy still working on magazines? Last thing I read about him was his redesign for Laurence King Publishing's identity. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Should we talk about books about magazines, too? I have quite a few, maybe you guys have some more to recommend?</div>

A study of all the magazines which <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Roger Black and Danilo Black<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been involved with will quickly show that he is probably even more so.

(doesn't hurt that Jude Law is on the cover. An amazing example of taking a face that perhaps is intended for body text and using it in a dynamic way for display purposes. Although it is a display version of the face. I also enjoy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Town &amp; Country's<!-- raw HTML omitted --> use of Requiem. In general, this is a well thought out magazine.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For all of you helvetica nay-sayers. Does anyone remember Michael Koepke's work on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Creme<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?

Have you seen the Book? The book itself is a perfect addition to anyone's library. I've used it in publication design class to show great use of composition. Cipe Pineles is another example of great design BM (before macintosh). And you can't forget the work of Paul Rand either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Does anyone remember <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Details<!-- raw HTML omitted --> before it became a men's magazine? It was a who's who and what's what of Manhattan life. I coveted those. Why oh why did I throw them away? Does anyone know who designed those? Or what about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TAXI<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? Sheesh my age is showing again. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Egg<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was pretty cool too. It had to have been one of the first magazines to try a square format. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flaunt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is really good for straight-forward (but with a wink) typography. Although I have a feeling it is more of a men's magazine. Hrant would like this one! ;) The latest issue is all about Italy, how timely for those of us going. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Admittedly I'm more old-school. But is this such a bad thing? Isn't design about discovery and re-discovery? Especially with type. I suppose the urge to design type comes from not wanting to use what is there already. But for magazine design this is not always feasible, therefore you find yourself on a road of discovery. Asking questions and looking for answers from what is there. But trying to take the answers and use them in new ways. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Magazine design isn't so different from building a house. The structure's skeleton (grid) must be strong enough to hold the rest. If you have a wonky grid then everything else will never hold strong or make sense.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">No Michael, I'm talking about the Spanish magazine designed by Fernando Gutierrez. It comes out once per year, it has an unusually large format and each issue is typeset in a different typeface (only one). It really is a beautiful magazine. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unfortunately, I don't think it has a URL. You could order an issue from the Magma Bookstore in London, though (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.magmabooks.com/content/bookshop/book.asp?cat=9&amp;amp;caller=search&amp;amp;id=1139">http://www.magmabooks.com/content/bookshop/book.asp?cat=9&amp;amp;caller=search&amp;amp;id=1139</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There was a great article about Gutierrez and Matador in Eye Magazine issue 36, summer 2000.
