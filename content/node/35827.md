  body: "I just ran through the set of 'T-26 sansserif'fonts at MyFonts, and there
    was a structural similarity with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/alphabet/\">Alphabet</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/sodium/\">Sodium</a>, but neither
    is very close without editing (hint, if desperate). It looks like a font, but
    possibly an altered one, with some elements removed.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike and Ellie - thanks alot for your rapid responses.  Both very helpful,
    especially Ellie...tweaking Template Gothic Bold will definitely suffice for now.\r\n\r\nNext
    question -  does anyone know how to untie a noose? ;)\r\n\r\n-Ben"

  body: you gotta stand up on your toes and crane your neck up while gently twisting
    your head back and forth so that you expand your neck muscles and loosen the knot.
    usually works for me.
