  type design, are you allowed to use a font (with a license) in it, and show values
  from the font, such as the spacing and kerning values? For example, you could set
  a word, draw lines to show the sidebearings, and write the spacing values from within
  the font underneath it, to show the distance from the glyph to its sidebearing.
  Might be a silly question, but I'm considering making a poster, so it seems wise
  to be sure :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper de Waard"

    fonts in editors, so you could either just ask for permission or better yet use
    an open source font, and remove the possibility of an issue. \r\n"

    yeah, it's such a minor violation that somebody would have to be pretty anal to
    complain.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I don't feel there is anything illegal about reading sidebearing values out
    of a font. It's not that different than gathering individual character widths
    (a prerequisite for formatting text) or kerning values. Think, for example, of
    an automatic Optical Margin Alignment feature.\r\n\r\nThat said: Jasper, are you
    working with InDesign? It's possible to write a script that converts type to outlines
    (*) and does these measurements; no need to delve into the actual font file.\r\n\r\n(*)
    And yes, I am aware that 'converting to outlines' is forbidden by some EULAs as
    well."

    started the poster and I am using my own font, alongside another font, because
    my own simply doesn't do the job. First functionality, then aesthetics, then personal
    preference."

    my fonts. Plus, if it's really for educational purposes, I would have no problem
    providing you with a reasonable number of fonts free of charge."
