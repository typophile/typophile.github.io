  used these letters as chapter initials in the World Bible of 1949, but I also recently
  discovered that he used them on the title page of \"The Wind in the Willows in 1940.\"
  If he designed these letters, it was most certainly not for the World Bible as I
  previously thought. Also, this type could have been an available font that he simply
  used for these jobs.\r\n\r\nAnyone know anything about this?"

  body: "I looked in three books I had that have information about Rogers' career,
    and a set of initials like these was not mentioned or shown in any of the books.
    Some examples of initials he used were shown, and in one case they were Cloister
    Initials, by Frederic Goudy.\r\n\r\nThe type for the World Bible was a version
    of Goudy Newstyle that Rogers did in collaboration with Sol Hess.\r\n\r\nSince
    the World Bible was basically set in a version of one of Goudy's typefaces, I
    looked in a book about Goudy's works to see if these initials were also his, but
    they were not shown in the collection that was supposed to show all of Goudy's
    type designs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    and the Jaspert Encyclopaedia of Type Faces. Also the Solotype Catalog, and several
    of the Dover books by Dan Solo. Couldn't find this set of initials in any of them.\r\n\r\n-

    a thing. I suppose it shall forever remain a mystery.\r\n\r\nYou may pass through
    this life and never see them again, to be sure. I can't imagine a modern application
    for these at all. I just wanted to digitize them to scratch an itch."
