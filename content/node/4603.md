  body: 'FYI, I&#39;ll have an essay &#40;&#34;Latinization: Prevention and Cure&#34;&#41;
    in their next issue. And from what I know it&#39;s going to be bi-lingual, which
    is great because my German is about as good as my Swahili. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I think I&#39;ve seen that book elsewhere, but I can&#39;t seem to recall
    where that might have been. <BR> <BR>Or I could be completely wrong. That cover
    page with the guillemets looks pretty familiar, though.

  body: '&#39;Spatium&#39; is a nice, little, bilingual type and design magazine..
    <BR>Featuring &#40; type &#41; designers / type and design related content, worldwide..
    <BR> <BR>&#40; It all began with a PDF only mag, years ago, and evolved into a
    regulary book style and classy magazine.. &#41; <BR> <BR>I love it, because I
    think that its one of a kind, over here.. <BR> <BR><i>&#40; And if you look closely
    you will find some of my artworks, featured in some of the previous issues.. &#41;</i>'
