body: I was wondering if Darth Vader were to use a font, what would it be? He's definitely
  got style and good taste so I immediately went for Futura because the beautiful
  symetrical curves and sharp corners contrast each other perfectly which is almost
  like a metaphor for the inner struggle of Vader himself. Any thoughts?

    it's gotta be Fette Fraktur.\r\nBTW, is there a version with proper, non-pansy
    numerals?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    qualities with Darth Vader. Well, maybe you could use style in the sense of being
    a colorful character, in the way that Wild Bill Hickok or Patton had attention-getting
    styles. But I don't think of Vader as being concerned with good taste.\r\n\r\nI'd
    use words more like driven and ruthless. And I don't think he'd give a damn about
    fonts. He'd use whatever military fonts were handy. \r\n\r\nHowever his personal
    handwriting would be more interesting \u2014 forceful, angry yet controlled, dangerous
    looking. "

    frequently overlooked more endearing qualities. Possibly a custom version of Letraset
    Freestyle Script with little hearts as tittles.\r\n\r\nAlternately, he might embrace
    his dark side and choose a font which conveyed pure evil. Then he'd go with either
    comic sans or papyrus.\r\n\r\nThe final solution would be the total subjugation
    of all available fonts. ALL OF YOUR FONTS ARE BELONG TO US!\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    Google font directory :-) However its lack of heavy fonts will have him looking
    elsewhere, as we know "Vader, only you would be <EM>so</EM> bold"

    went over to the Dark Side. Consequently, Comic Sans is far more suitable for
    Vader than for Jar Jar Binks: it's an appealing font, perfectly suitable in proper
    context, which has been senselessly and tragically abused.\r\n\r\nThe iconic can
    be ironic, depending upon in which cheek the tongue rests\u2026"

    Maybe someone (with more experience than I could offer) developed a \"Tragic Sans\"
    to accompany Comic Sans. That would be quite an interesting project and/or type

    grant you that he had style if the movie indicated he had anything to do with
    his outfit's design, but I don't think it did. Maybe he said \"make it black\",
    but he was recovering from serious injuries and I'd assume the outfit was created
    by medical folks primarily as a modified military outfit designed for medical
    support. "
