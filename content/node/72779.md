  post here - although I've enjoyed much advice and entertainment from this site before
  today.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate your thoughts on a type choice  and some simple indentity
  work. I'm re-branding a little business of mine - and as expected, being to close
  to the subject means it's difficult to be objective. The business is a small studio
  specialising in 3D computer generated imagery, and photographic based illustration
  for advertising and marketing use. Most clients are either corporate marking departments,
  or ad agencies, but I'm looking to add some editorial work to the mix. Typical current
  work is in a realistic or technical style, but i am looking to broaden this, so
  the branding needs to work for a wider market. I also do some photoshop and other
  training under this brand.\r\n\r\nThe two options shown are: top; my initial choice
  of Dalton Maags 'Co. Headline'. For me, the big issue here is width. Vantage Graphics
  is a fairly long name, which I'm reluctant to change, and I think it works best
  set as one line.\r\n\r\nA second look made me consider a very different alternative
  of 'Mekanik'. I like this for it's industrial conotations - which sits well with
  most of my current clients, and it solves the width issue.\r\n\r\nI realise these
  are two very diffierent solutions. Mekanik works better IMHO given the name, but
  is it too industrial, mecanical and masculine?\r\n\r\nYour thoughts and critique
  on this - and the 'V in circle' logo - would be welcomed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\n\r\nMike
  A.\r\n\r\nPS: should have said the above images are not final - letterspacing needs
  fixing etc."

    the shapes in the mark somehow. As of now they\u2019re completely unrelated. If
    you think of the mark as just another glyph in your font you\u2019d expect the
    shapes to bare mark of the same tools/construction as the type, wouldn\u2019t
    you? \r\n\r\nThat said, your mark might be a bit too generic.\r\n\r\nDrawing the
    glyphs yourself also let you give it the \u201Cfeel\u201D you\u2019re looking
    for while keeping it narrow, and \u2014 the most important part \u2013 it\u2019ll
    be unique!"

    mark. But I also have to echo Frode's remark about picking up the shape in the
    accompanying typeface - right now it is very disconnected.\r\nAt the very least,
    you should try to find a font that picks up the width/angle of the V. \r\nPlease
    post your progress!"

  body: "Frank, Seb - Thanks for your comments. Yes, I can't disagree - there is a
    disconnect between the 'wide V' of the mark and the 'narrow V' of the font. I
    guess I'm trying to force a connection here as I like the form of the mark and
    I like the style of Mekanik.\r\n\r\nAs I was drawing the mark I was getting a
    sense of deja vu - but I couldn't quite place it. As it happens a Star Trek vibe
    would probably fit OK with a few of my clients - so I can live with that :) It
    is a simple mark - but I'm wanting something that will work down to favicon size.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    else?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "To come back on this...\r\n\r\nRiccard - thanks for your comment. That was
    something that I'd thought of but not tried until now.\r\n\r\nGiven the comments,
    I reviewed the font choice as well as my thoughts on the mark. I looked again
    at my shortlist, but came back to using a condensed face - Mekanik or a modified
    Univers Condensed 49.\r\n\r\nSo, before I go any further, apologies to Mr. Frutiger.
    I'm working way beyond my level of typographic competence here.\r\n\r\nHere's
    my latest work in progress:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VantageGraphics_v2_4902.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>\r\nModifications
    are a redrawing of the capital V, changes to the ascender/descender length and
    some change to the height of the body of the lowercase g.\r\n\r\nI've also re-drafted
    the mark to match the design of the initial capital V.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts?"
