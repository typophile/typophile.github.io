  finally time to subject my fonts to scrutiny. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been designing fonts
  on-and-off &#40;mostly off&#41; for a few years, purely as a hobby.  Most of my
  designs so far aren&#39;t hugely original - Sooker is my first attempt at something
  a little more unique. I wanted to try and create something idiosyncratic, yet legible
  too. <BR> <BR>Lower and uppercase characters are complete, as well as some punctuation.
  <BR> <BR>I would be extremely grateful for any comments and feedback before I start
  work on the bold weight. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: Sooker-39946.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*9.6*Sooker+pdf*Sooker%2epdf

  body: Wow, first post and it&#39;s in the critique section... <BR> <BR>Andrew, this
    looks nice. It has a lot of stature. I like the straight sides of the letters
    and some glyphs like the e and the g are especially nice. <BR> <BR>The cap S looks
    a little top heavy to my eye, maybe the top could be smaller and/or the waistline
    of the glyph moved up a little. <BR> <BR>To get back to the e. I like it. The
    angled bottom on its eye is nice and the taper to the back is a nice touch. Where
    the taper connects to the vertical stem though it has a little blobiness. You
    might need to curve the stem into the intersection or employ some trapping to
    mitigate against this. At larger sizes, I think the eye looks a little large,
    but at the smaller sizes it seems to do well. <BR> <BR>You might want to bring
    the dot on the i down a little. <BR> <BR>The g seems to tip a little to the right.
    I&#39;d also look at beefing up the bar on the f. <BR> <BR>Nice work Andrew. Welcome
    to the forums. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: looks good. <BR> <BR>the first flaws i recognized are the t and the f. t is
    leaning backwards and a bit heavy on the bottom while the f is heavy on top, left
    curve. <BR> <BR>in general nice work!

  body: I really like the overall feeling of the type. Jon&#39;s word stature goes
    a long way towards describing what&#39;s working already. It does feel as though
    it needs polishing everywhere. But on the other hand - I think it looks like that
    work would be absolutely worthwhile.

  body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the comments - it&#39;s gratifying to know that
    it&#39;s worth taking this further. <BR> <BR>Usability is exactly what I was striving
    for.  The goal was to create something distinctive that could be used as body
    text but isn&#39;t too quirky. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to make the glyphs a bit
    more consistent at the moment &#40;especially stroke width&#41; and I&#39;ve also
    toned down the t and f. It seems to work a bit better as a result. <BR> <BR>I
    will post another pdf when it&#39;s done. <BR> <BR>Thanks everyone <BR>A

  body: "After nearly two years it's probably about time I updated this thread!\r\n\r\nSince
    my last post, my first fonts (Exuberance and Exuberance Primary) are now commercially
    available from <a href=\"http://www.t26.com/\">T-26</a> and I've rediscovered
    Sooker in an effort to add to my portfolio.  Sooker is now a four weight family,
    with italics to follow.\r\n\r\nThe spacing and kerning have yet to be completed
    but would be grateful for your thoughts before I continue.  Who knows, it might
    even be ready by the end of the decade!\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at <a href=\"http://www.andrewgraham.co.uk/files/pdfs/SookerFamily.pdf\">this
    PDF</a> and feel free to give your comments.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nAndrew"

  body: "Just looking at the lc for now:\r\nMany of the glyphs, like the \"k\"*, are
    lacking the stroke contrast that seems to be inherent to this design. Your \"g\"
    is wonderful (except for the weak ear) but it's out of character - in fact I would
    love to see a whole new font spawned from it!\r\n\r\n* BTW, may I ask how you
    drew that?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the comments Hrant.  I'm loath to get rid of the g, but now I
    can see it doesn't quite gel with the rest of the font.\r\n\r\nI drew the k using
    the following method:\r\n1) start with a letter l\r\n2) copy it and rotate 40ish
    degrees clockwise, trim to size\r\n3) copy the l in step 1, rotate 40ish degrees
    anticlockwise and trim\r\n4) realise it doesn't look great, start panicking and
    move points around until I get something a bit better.\r\n\r\nI find that I rely
    on step 4 quite a lot when I draw glyphs!\r\n\r\nNeed a bit of help here.  Where
    else do you suggest modifying the stroke contrast?"

  body: "I just found this again. I agree with Hrant - the g is really interesting
    but that yes - it should be stripped from this font for the overall effectiveness
    of the face. In general I find that the face is very pleasant - suprisingly so
    given the lack of humanistic contrasts in general. Maybe it's just the ratios
    in the shapes. It's very pleasing in running text. \r\n\r\nI wonder if it would
    be a good idea to soften some of the more unusual features a little such as in
    the lower case 'e'. The pure geometry of the C is causing an illusion to my eye
    which makes it appear weak or wobbly. Maybe a softer join would be better. ( G
    too) The same contruction is used in the O of course but it doesn't bother my
    eye there. Probably because it is closed. The on the bottom of the Cedilla the
    hook could feel more exhuberant and it would feel more at home in the face I think.
    Same with the tail of the Q and the ear of the g. I think the % sign needs to
    be weightier. Now it looks indecisive. Is it mean to be a ligher weight than the
    other glyphs for some reason or no? It's too liminal now. The a seems like it
    is maybe wider than it needs to be and I wonder if the e should take some of it's
    flavor from the a somehow. Please take all this witha grain of salt. It's all
    observed on a laptop screen I have no printer where I am today. I have some spacing
    comments too but I would rather wait to see what you do with some of what I see
    as the problem glyph shapes before mentioning anything. Keep going. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Thanks Eben - very helpful comments.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps there are two coherent
    fonts lurking in here somewhere - a straightforward text face and something a
    little more suited to display.  The latter could incorporate the unusual features
    of the a, e and, yes, that g.  \r\n\r\nI think at the moment I'm trying to negotiate
    that thin line between producing something distinctive and producing something
    familiar.  When can \"unusual\" be absolutely right?  If I knew the answer I'd
    be a happy man.  Anyway I shall certainly keep trying.  Thanks once again for
    the comments!"

  body: "I think your right about it being possible to make things that are both distinctive
    & which nevertheless work -  & work well. In fact I think all really tasty/solid
    typographic innovation falls into this category. But it isn't easy. It seems like
    you are resonably close to having a viable face with Sooker that you could go
    for the low hanging fruit & just concentrate on testing the font really well &
    generally doing a solid workman like job of the thing. Which is no small feat
    in fact. If you do that really well then you may even create innovatiuon which
    is less obvious but valauble nonetheless. And then yes maybe a display font too.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand you could stick to your guns 7 work & rework the ideas until they
    fit into the face in a more organic way. Or you could put it down & come back
    when you have trained your eye further... or ....\r\n\r\nWhatever keeps you working
    away at type is probbably the right choice.\r\n\r\n I hope you post the next edition
    for us to see. Cheers!"
