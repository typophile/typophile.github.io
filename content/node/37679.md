  trying to come up with a mono version of the Magners/Bulmers Irish Cider logo and
  need the fonts involved.\r\n\r\nAnyone know this one, seems quite similar to Shelley?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-edwardian-script/\">Edwardian
    Script</a> is a better match. Look at the lower case letters, especially the 'r'.
    I think the O may have been drawn by hand, and obviously the g tail has been re-drawn.\r\n\r\n
