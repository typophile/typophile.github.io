body: "Hello,\r\nAfter downloading hundreds of fonts, I keep coming across two issues:\r\n#1.
  \ The list gets long, and programs take longer to load that access the font library.
  \ What can you do about this?  I seen someone refer to suitcase fusion 2, briefly
  I seen make font temporarily available, so do these types of programs keep the list
  small until you need them?\r\n\r\n#2.  There are certain fonts that halt the scrolling
  of the CS# suite(ps/ai/fw), I resorted to removing those fonts from the system.
  \ Mangal, Latha, etc all would not render for the programs and stop the scrolling
  with wheel mouse with highlighted text.  Though, that probably is not the best way
  to pick fonts.  Is removing those fonts the best option, and what is the best way
  to pick fonts to see how they work for logos besides scrolling the list of hundreds?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    fonts on disk, rather than just installed ones, and customizing sample text.\r\n\r\nI
    wrote a FreeType based proggy myself, just to do this (viewing sample text in
    any font, not managing them); but then again, that's not for everyone to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's
    funny you say that \"Mangal, Latha, etc\" will not 'render' for CS programs. Do
    you even know what those fonts are meant for?"

    scrolling through a font list full of 100s of random fonts. "

    my option right now?  I want to break them down into tagged categories like serif/sans/callig/scrip/etc.
    \ Browsing through fonts on a disk, instead of just installed?  Good.  Will look
    one up, I know my mac has a decent one with osx, but windows is lacking.\r\n\r\nYes
    they are foreign, I originally did install under language/regional settings all
    the fonts, but it still didn't work in cs4 so removed it all, and the fonts, it
    is just annoying, I'll make a vm guest with francais keyboard/language settings
    if I want that stuff, stinks that adobe doesn't skip over them, instead halts."
