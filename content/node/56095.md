body: "hello, I'm designing an exhibition's stationery; letterhead, business card,
  envelope\r\nand the logo of the exhibition has been made by H&FJ Archer.\r\nSo i'd
  like to find one more interesting font that goes very well with archer\r\nThe exhibition
  is named 361\u02DA so it should suggest some kind of extraordinary yet subtle and
  professionally\r\nThe thing that i had most problems with is the letterhead\r\nI
  had tried some font, but it's not working well much\r\nso any suggestion would be
  appreciate,\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nSam"
