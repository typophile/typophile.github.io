body: Hi! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious about finding informations related to [see subject
  ;-&#41;] on the Inet, except for a czech site written in czech. There is a book
  called &#34;Detailtypographie&#34; &#40;in German&#41; from Forssmann/deJong, but
  the informations there are only scratching the surface and cover just a few languages.
  <BR> <BR>Maybe I used the wrong keywords in search engines &#40;being no native
  speaker&#41;, so if anybody could post a link, that would be great. <BR> <BR>Thanks
  in advance, <BR> <BR>Andreas

  body: <i>Detailtypografie</i> may only really cover German, but it goes way deeper
    than the surface. This book has become the &#34;Bible&#34; of German typography,
    and is quite thorough and good, if a little dry

    <BR>You mean all I need is that book, a <i>Duden</i> and a bowtie and I can actually
    <i>be</i> Erik Spiekermann? Cool!

  body: Detailtypografie was writen by Friedrich Forssman &amp; Ralf de Jong, not
    by Erik Spiekermann. I&#39;ll let you continue to use your imagination to try
    and find ways of becomming more like him

    just the first German typographer who popped into my head.'

  body: No doubt, Detailtypografie is a bible to me as well, but I am looking for
    differences in typesetting in even more languages than those that are covered
    there &#40;e. g. spacing in combination with quotation marks, as used in french
    typesetting&#41;, and I also don&#39;t want to rely only on one source... <BR>
    <BR>As for English, it&#39;s easy to find a lot, but what about information if
    there has to be space before three periods &#40;as at the end of the last sentence&#41;
    in Hungarian? Written in a language I understand?  ;-&#41;  And visiting websites
    in that languages to find examples often offers more questions than answers. <BR>
    <BR>Another possibility would be to start a project in wikipedia.org, but I&#39;m
    afraid that &#34;Typographic rules in foreign languages&#34; would not be the
    keyword&#40;s&#41; someone else would search for and I don&#39;t know of a more
    suitable term.

    <BR>Hart&#39;s Rules for Compositors &#40;also mentioned in Bringhurst&#41; has
    sections on European languages and its, much cheaper, descendant also from Oxford
    press has limited information on European languages. <BR><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198691750/ref=pd_sim_b_dp_2/026-4159726-8602060"

    <BR>Bringhurst also mentions getting style guides in the language they are intended
    for - not much use if you don&#39;t know the language. As for relying on websites
    for information only experience of the host really gives me confidence to trust
    them. <BR>Tim

  body: 'The multilingual section of Detailtypografie is actually pretty good, although
    buggy. I actually corrected a few bugs in the Polish-relevant information just
    before the 2nd edition of the book went to press. My corrections went to the errata.  <BR>
    <BR>It&#39;s really the only reasonable source that covers several languages at
    once. For German, obviously, it is an excellent source.  <BR> <BR>For Polish,
    there is good information on the web collected by my good fellow Robert Chwalowski:  <BR><a
