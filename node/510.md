  body: One of your images didn&#39;t show up. I&#39;m assuming the one that did show
    up is what you would call &#34;faux Hebrew&#34; and is not what you&#39;re looking
    for?

  body: Dan Solo of Solotype had a font called Shalom. It exists in some poorly-digitized
    versions on the web, but he did a digitization himself before he closed up shop
    a few years ago. I&#39;m not sure how widely available his version is.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12486.jpg"
