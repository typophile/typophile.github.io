		<div class="commentbody">Tom, I like the image you're going for quite a bit, but I think the K needs to be sturdier. The righthand leg feels too flared, or perhaps too tapered at the top. The thinning of the upper diagonal is better in the second version, but I still think the flaring of the leg is too strong. Also, the lefthand leg is getting eaten away by the negative space of the rays, but I'm not sure that's as much of a problem. Adjusting these might help for smaller sizes, though (which will cause problems at all of those joins). I guess I'd recommend being freer with the manipulation of the original letterform. <BR> <BR>Are you still considering Champion Gothic Bantamweight? <BR> <BR>Also, I prefer the earlier versions, in spite of the piano interpretations. I actual saw a clock hand/ metranome moving at first glance. I like the concept a lot. I'm eager to see where it goes.</div>

I know there will be type and more info on it and this can change how I'm looking to it now. I've looked on an old logo book (from '91 DAVID E.

		<div class="commentbody">I'll have to admit over-using the linear halftoning effect during the late 80s and early 90s myself, and for that reason I haven't found myself going there anymore, but I wouldn't steer Tom away from experimenting with the technique. I think exploring as many techniques as possible for value gradation is essential to any designer's education. This is a great collection of samples Adriano. <BR> <BR>I'm not quite feelin' the logo yet, Tom. Fortunately for you, I don't have to. I think I'm on a similar page to Ryan's. I'm not crazy about the flaring of the leg and upper arm/stroke (optical). I kind of like the light rays starting inside the base of the stem, but I wonder if they angled, causing a slight flare to the base of the stem, if it would offer more stability. Maybe even start the top ray by completely separating the base of the stem by following the upper arm/stroke through the stem. Have you tried stopping the rays at the outer edge of the leg? <BR> <BR>Just some thoughts. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

Obviously, the optical perception of the vertex will vary with print size and technique, but right now that part looks too thin IMO. <BR> <BR>What about alternating an extra-long (beyond the square shape) ray and a shorter one to add some visual interest to that side? <BR> <BR>Also, about the &quot;80s look&quot;: Most of the companies that used a linear halftone logo were telecommunications (AT&amp;T) or high-tech, like the ones Adriano posted. Since Kentucky Lights is actually a lighting supplier, your use of rays in the logo is representative of their business rather than a trendy design feature. <BR> <BR>Make sure the new business cards spell &quot;commercial&quot; right <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

I like your idea of separating the bottom with the top, Scott. <BR> <BR>I feel that my logo doesn't fit in with that group of logos posted (as Chase said above) because it is symbolizing light which is relative to the company. Light will probably always be symbolized by bursts and rays. Customers immediately (if done right) should think light.

		<div class="commentbody">I find the first versions you posted best, Tom. They are the only ones communicating &quot;light&quot; at two different cogitive levels. The first level is visual description: rays. The second one is a subtle presentation of light by thin white spaces (between rays) which actually &quot;shine&quot; somewhere from behind the K logo. The thick parts, which are sitting on the rays then make little geometrical shadows. <BR> <BR>That first logos make the viewer FEEL the light. <BR> <BR>I am afraid this second layer of meaning has been spoiled in later versions. The reason might be in fact that you have turned those shadows into some kind of wall. This wall can even be understood as a device for stopping the light. You don't want that, do you? <BR> <BR>In case you agree with my advice, then maybe you will have to balance those thick parts of the K and white spaces a bit more carefully.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Lauri: thank you for your kind words. I am not concerned with the v-a association because I think a K is seen before any other letters. <BR> <BR>Matjaz: The problem with the first version was my client didn't like it at all. He has seen another logo I did that was more simplistic and streamline and wanted his to have the same look. After I did the latest version he is happy with the direction it is going.  <BR> <BR>The big thing I am trying to figure out is type that will go with the icon. I am thinking about buying hoefler's knockout or Raleigh (<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/raleigh-gothic/roman/testdrive.html?s=KENTUCKY%2BLIGHTS&amp;p=72" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/raleigh-gothic/roman/testdrive.html?s=KENTUCKY&amp;#43;LIGHTS&amp;amp;p=72">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/raleigh-gothic/roman/testdrive.html?s=KENTUCKY&amp;#43;LIGHTS&amp;amp;p=72</a></a>) <BR> <BR>I would like to hear opionons on if these would be good choices. I obviously want to be sure before I buy one of them. <BR> <BR>Thanks,</div>
