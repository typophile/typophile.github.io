body: "I'm currently working on a logo for my sister who's becoming a freelance accountant.
  I've tried to keep ther logo formal & geometric to suit the branch she's in, but
  I'm not really pleased with the results so far. I'm quite happy with logo a. (if
  I don't stare at it for too long), but it seems to be lacking something. I like
  the idea behind logo c. (wordmark 4.) as well, but not the execution. Same story
  with logo d.; the idea here was to have a baseline & an arrow by arranging her initials
  K & L to represent a logistic kind of icon. As for the wordmarks, number 3. is probably
  my favourite, but some other opinions would be nice to hear.\r\nAny suggestions
  are welcome![img:sites/default/files/old-images/KL_6613.jpg]"

    of it in a, though - it has a little Arts-and-Crafts monogram or stained-glass

    vertical form a vertex just outside the diagonal line (see the join of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/avenir/roman/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26seed%3D26%26dock%3D0%26size%3D61%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3Dk%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga|Frutiger's

    c seems arbitary and calls to mind Fed Ex. Logo d says \"hitting the glass ceiling\"
    to me.\r\n\r\nI agree that wordmark 3 is best of these. "

    t and the j especially wonk against each other. (Is that a thing?) Aside from
    tweaking the line weights, I think it works great for a female accountant. \r\n\r\nLogo
    b is the most pleasing. I like the colors, but I'm not sure they're appropriate
    for an accountant. Perhaps deep blues mixed with soft, steely grays would offer
    a more sturdy yet feminine aesthetic? I'm seeing an oxidized silver pendant look
    -- something that has some actual weight to it. Evocative of a woman smack-dab
    between Lilith Crane and \"I am woman, hear me roar\" on the femininity continuum.
    (That conjured up Julia Sugarbaker in my head, actually!)\r\n\r\nI often surf
    around on etsy when I need inspiration for women-owned businesses. [[http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5868807|This

    the idea of only using a wordmark. I'll have to explain it to my sister though
    'cause to people who are not into graphic design, it might just seem lazy ;-)\r\nI'm
    glad you all voted for 3., so I used that as a jumping off point. Since my sister's
    a person & not a company, I tried to give the wordmark a bit of a 'human touch'.
    I'm a big fan of swashes myself & I though this would be a good idea to give the
    wordmark a feminine feeling. Hopefully this won't take it too far away from accountancy
    although I don't really mind making it a little 'off-centered' if you know what
    I mean ('cause to be honest I don't recall ever seeing a goodlooking accountant
    logo). I kept it all very minimalistic to try not to disturb the equilibrium between
    accountancy & femininity & I like the outcome though I'm a bit scared it might
    look to florist-like to other people. So again, I'd like your advice on these
    versions. My personal favourites are 2. & 4..\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KL2_4868.jpg]\r\nI've
    also made some alterations to the logo as suggested, but I think I'll stick to

  body: "Wow, this is a really nice solution.\r\nWhat this swash approach seems to
    communicate, to my eyes, is: It's serious business (&lt; the squarish regularity
    of the type), and she fulfills that exactly and nicely; but, she also thinks out
    of the box, and adds her personal \"note\" to what she does (&lt; the unexpected
    but nicely working swashes) &ndash; an unexpected plus! It's serious with a feminine
    touch. Nice.\r\n\r\nI'd just take care not to make it *too* exuberant/extravagant
    though &ndash; she doesn't make jewelry, in the end. To my eyes, #4 works best
    (and is the max in swashiness that I'd see in this, maybe tone it down a little?).
    Maybe #2, but I'm not sure about that \"j\" swash, it looks a bit tight and not
    very \"flowing\".\r\n\r\nIt doesn't communicate <em>what</em> she does, but that
    might be difficult with accountants anyway and if it's not an absolute requirement
    for her, so be it."

  body: Dunno .. the wordmarks - I see a fly-casting or a designer outlet logo at
    best, not an accountant. Too artsy-fartsy if you pardon my French. The b/w logo
    feels "heavy", perhaps more fit for an edgy graphics designer. The color logo
    mark looks more like a non-profit / community logo of some kind, again nothing
    that would evoke associations with a freelance accountant (not sure what it is
    actually) at all.

    I prefer only one character having the swash treatment. To me the J treatment
    is more subtle and sophisticated. The swash on the K''s look thin and fragile,
    a bit too swashy - keep it closer to the either the Cap height or the base line

    line of business well. Hopefully she won't think the opposite of the swashes.\r\nI've
    had quite a hard time trying to convey accountancy through a (decent) logo & to
    be honest I still don't know how to do it without using a icon for a calculator
    or abacus, but with all your help I just might have found the perfect solution!

    She's in accounting. No place for soft and undefined numbers. Your logos are very
    feminine but they don't relate to accounting at all.\r\n\r\nIf I had to choose
    from any of the last batch I'd go with #7, because I trust my accountant for its
    precise calculations and great tax suggestions. No space for variables here...
    I'd keep the minimum swash of the J just because she's a woman.\r\n\r\nEver thought
    of incorporating numbers between letters in very light contrast variation and
    also with more soft and rounded stroke? This way, you'd emphasize your sister's
    name make it strong and powerful but have those numbers reflect feminine feeling
    while still connecting with accounting precision ...\r\n\r\nBTW: the 3+4 in the

    It's hard business, yes, but it's not as completely bland and uncreative as many
    think, I've been made to believe. This friend has his *heart* in it and says it's
    really not as grey and monotonous as many people think. I have no reason not to
    believe him, but maybe it would be interesting to hear if Tom's sister herself
    thinks this is true.\r\n\r\nThinking out of the box, finding strategies, offering
    a little extra effort on top of very accurate and precise work (which, obviously,
    remains the core): If that makes sense in her field (and I have been assuming

  body: "Maybe the term 'feminine' was a little misplaced or just a wrong choice of
    words... The idea behind the swashes was mainly to take the edge of the first
    draft, making it a bit less bland, more friendly looking. Basically just adding
    a little personality. PennANDink made a good comment by stating that it's a logo
    for a person, not a business & I tried to convey some of my sister's personality
    in this logo rather than just sticking to a general idea about accountancy that
    most of us probably have (that it is indeed grey and monotonous). I think the
    aspect about accountancy that attracts my sister to it is basically the accuracy
    & details that are needed to do it right (almost in a motherly caring way). I
    think that's an aspect about our personalities that we share (which in our case
    is borderline neurotic ;-p) although it translates very different for both of
    us & only really reveals itself in everyday situations. Out of the 2 of us (or
    even 3 counting my other sister) Katja is probably the most 'centered' one, but
    that doesn't make her bland or boring by any means. Being convential doesn't make
    you narrow-minded by default at all; in a worst case scenario it just hides it
    better to the outside world. I guess what I'm trying to say with the swashes is
    that there is more than meets the eye.\r\nAltaira's first interpretation after
    the introduction of the swashes was precisely what I was aiming for: precise but
    personal, professional but not robotic."
