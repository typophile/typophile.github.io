  (more info [[http://www.marksimonson.com/article/179/frutiger-talk|here]]) at some
  point he shows a picture of a old magazine/newspaper about typography (Upper and
  Lower Case I think) \r\nthat shows an article from Frutiger called \"Design and
  development of one basic typeface into a family of 21 different weights and proportions\".\r\nI
  would love to read this article.\r\nSince I couldn't find it on the web I was wonder
  in anyone here has this article that can share.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n"
