  from their 1923 specimen book. The 200dpi preview can be found here: <BR> <BR><a

  <BR> <BR>Apologies for the JPEG artifacts in that image. I tried Hrant&#39;s recipe
  for making a GIF, but for this particular scan the paper texture posterized into
  something resembling a skin rash, so no thanks. <BR> <BR>The full-resolution, 2400,
  37M image is attainable by removing the _sm from the above URL. By all means, download
  if you&#39;re really interested, but please don&#39;t hammer the server. <BR> <BR>The
  scan is fairly raw; the grayscale axis is calibrated to sRGB &#40;which is a bit
  lighter in gamma than most of the scans I&#39;ve done so far&#41;, but there is
  no sharpening or other image processing. It would probably benefit from a modest
  sharpen. <BR> <BR>For those who are merely curious, hopefully the following illustration
  will be of some interest. It shows all four sizes from the smaller lowercase a pattern
  plate, normalized to 400 pixels/em. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/42587.gif"
  alt="Optical scaling in 1923 ATF Garamond"> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m toying with the idea
  of making these hi-res scans more generally available, perhaps on a DVD-R. Would
  there be interest in such a thing? <BR>'

  body: Ralph, thanks a lot! <BR>I&#39;m downloading the big one now. <BR> <BR>As
    for general interest, I think there wouldn&#39;t be much in terms of raw scans,
    but if you made a CD&#42; with the scans, some nice graphs, maybe a spreadsheet
    of the raw data for third-party processing, and a nice essay/analysis, you might
    actually be able to sell it &#40;like through Typophile or at a type conference&#41;,
    for a small amount. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
