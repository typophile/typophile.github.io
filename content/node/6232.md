  body: I cannot be sure from such a small and light gif, but this looks an awful
    lot like the Troy typeface designed by William Morris and used by him at his Kelmscott
    Press. <BR> <BR>-- K.

  body: Thanks for the pointer Kent, you were soooo close. Officially I&#39;d have
    to say it was the copied version that Hrant speaks of. It is the type that was
    used for some issues of Bradley His Book. Except it was called <i>Satanick</i>.
    <BR> <BR>The foundry that &#34;<i>stole</i> Troy was ATF in 1896. When they asked
    for permission from Morris he told them to go to hell. They had already, in 1893,  produced
    an imitation of &#34;Golden&#34; type and called it Jenson Old Style. <BR> <BR>In
    the spirit of irony here is a present. It was printed in 1896 - in Satanick. <BR>

    is that ATF&#39;s eventual invention of the pantograph &#40;or actually their
    failure in getting people to use it with enough sensitivity to optical scaling&#41;
    would put them there much better than the theft of any single design... <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hrant <BR> <BR>Benton&#39;s pantograph actually predates Morris&#39; Kelmscott
    Press by a few years. More often overlooked in type history is the role of the
    photograph, which in terms of public usage and availability really comes about
    at about this time. Morris, thanks to Emery Walker&#39;s inspiration, was the
    first to exloit the photograph for revival purposes. His faces were reinterpretations
    of historical specimens. Kelmscott&#39;s success led to similar activities by
    the foundries. The &#34;theft&#34; the camera allowed was unprecedented. <BR>
