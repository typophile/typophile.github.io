  a local Mortgage company.  The company name is First Home Equity Loans.  He asked
  for a new logo to be \"upstanding, professional, and to look bigger than the company
  really is\".  He is a former Marine and carries himself and his business in a very
  upstanding and patriotic demeanor.  I developed two different ideas for the logo
  and he chose from the two.  I would like some feedback on both of them as the one
  he chose will need to be more fully developed and the one he did not choose I would
  like to possibly use in the future.  The customer was happy with the file called
  \"fhe logo approved.pdf\" and I would like to finalize that one.  The other file
  \"fhe house tab sample.pdf\" is the file I would like to possibly re-use in the
  future.  Again I would appreciate any feedback or critique.  I will try to be responsive
  with any requests. Please keep in mind this is one of my first projects and I would
  like to make this a portfolio piece.  Thanks.  \r\n\r\nOh and by the way I would
  like some feedback on the perception of the geometric icon in the approved logo.
  \ Is it recognizable? does it read as houses connected or not?"
