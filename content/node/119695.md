  am looking for a combination of fonts for my new website.\r\nI love the font Simplifica:
  http://freetypography.com/2014/03/24/free-font-simplifica/\r\nbut it only has one
  weight (light). Do you know of a nice font that would go with it for titles. I thought
  of Serifa but not quite right, its a bit too harsh but something along those lines.
  Or nexa slab.\r\nthanks so much for your help.\r\n\r\nisabelle"
