  body: "That question would be most easily answered by a label printer, but it will
    vary based on how you intend to apply the labels. Nearly any kind of paper or
    plastic film can have adhesive applied to it, but those that already come that
    way are limited.\r\n\r\nHow many bottles is he trying to label? For more than
    a gross you'll probably want to have a machine do it, but for less than that a
    few people could manage applying self-adhesive labels by hand. Some papers are
    more suited to high-speed/high-volume processes than others, and others require
    careful attention. You could even skip labels all together and have the markings
    silkscreened directly on to the glass. \r\n\r\nWhat's important to consider is
    the quantity of bottles, the price-point of the wine, and the image you want to
    project about it. Things will fall into place once you know that."

    far as I know liquor labels are printed on specialised papers. \r\n\r\nYour local
    paper dealerships could help you better, but this one is really nice:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lanapapier.fr/fr/2produits/3-PT-etiquette.html\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Specialized papers? Yes, there may be regulations regarding liquor packages
    in certain jurisdictions mandating particular papers for the labels. I wasn't
    aware of them being specialized apart from being able to endure the rigors of
    automated application. I've seen liquor bottles labeled with many different materials.
    There absolutely are regulations for what information must be included on the
    labels, which also vary according to political subdivisions.\r\nCheck your area's
    ordinances on the subject."

  body: "\"...there may be regulations regarding liquor packages...\"\r\nOf course
    those are there, but I don't think they determine choice of paper. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Specialized
    papers?\"\r\nYes. Liquor labels, especially premium brands, use paper with higher
    'wet strength'. These are papers specially manufactured for the moist conditions
    in which liquor bottles are usually stored. \r\n\r\n"
