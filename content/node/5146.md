body: okay i know i&#39;m really bad about not posting a sample and all, but i figgered
  that anyone in the US who gets a newspaper would have seen this the past couple
  weeks. If you know what i&#39;m talking about and know the name of the font, lemme
  know. If no one else got the flyer, i&#39;ll try to post a sample tomorrow.

    Stuart Sandler&#39;s <a href="http://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5388">Cocktail
    Shaker</a>, though it&#39;s over at Chank&#39;s house. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37884.gif"

  body: that&#39;s the one! i remember seeing it at chank now that you say that. and
    i shoulda known it was one of stuarts, but couldn&#39;t find it on his sight.
    guess that threw me for a loop.

  body: I knew I&#39;d seen it before, too, but for me, at least, it took browsing
    through Mike Yanega&#39;s site to find it. When I saw it, I knew it was Stuart&#39;s,
    but then I couldn&#39;t find it on his site, then had to search Google, where
    I finally found it on Chank&#39;s. Interestingly, it&#39;s not even listed in
    the Chank A-Z catalog, but its own page is still there on the site. <BR> <BR>Stu?
    Chank? Anyone have any insights on this?

  body: '&#62; Stu, if yer reading, you should have someplace on yer site that showcases
    fonts you&#39;ve done that are available from different sources. Good idea? no?
