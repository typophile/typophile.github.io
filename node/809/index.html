We moved from the polytonical(many tones) to the monitonical(one tone) system in the 1970's. Let me give a lecture. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the greek revolution in 1821, the newly founded country had to determine it's ethnicity. So, apart from the religion (orthodox), they came up with a language that was neither like ancient greek, nor like the one ppl were speaking back then, but a pompous mix of both. This mixture was named &quot;katharevousa&quot; (&quot;pure/clean/clear language&quot;) and it was declared official language of Greece. Now, ancient greeks only had uppercase letters and had no problems in pronounciation (they knew it by heart)(first texts in greek are dated around 1200 b.c.). However, after alexander the great (who conquered, in today's terms, pretty much the whole of greece, egypt, turkey, iraq, iran and went all the way to india and that was around 320 b.c.), the language had to be simplified. I think they started developing lowercase around then too. Anyway, to ensure that everybody got the pronounciation right, they made 3 different tones and 2 other symbols (the exact translation would be spirits - nothing to do with demonology though) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One tone to signify that you had to heighten your voice in that syllable, another meant that you had to lower your voice, a third meant that the toned vowel had to be pronounced twice. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other 2 symbols had to do with the pronounciation of the first letter, if there would be a thick or thin sound of an &quot;h&quot; to it (&quot;hercules&quot;, &quot;hypnopaedia&quot;, &quot;hellas&quot; and many other h- words are taken from greek and the special &quot;spirit&quot; for a thick &quot;h&quot; sound has been replaced by the &quot;h&quot; letter). These symbols also had a use in spelling correctly when creating compound words. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, all this signs no longer serve a cause, because the ancient way of pronouncing has been long forgotten (even the byzantines didnt know it)&hellip; They only served as a helping hand (or not?) in learning and spelling correctly. The whole katharevousa thing created a gap between simple folks and writers/official texts etc.(they didnt understand it). They thought that the only way to enrich the current language was to fill it with unusable ancient terms - big mistake. It was like you had to use 2 different languages, one for everyday speaking and the other for writing officially. It was replaced by modern greek once the army dictatorship was over, in 1975. Ever since the official language is &quot;modern&quot; greek, which has no &quot;spirits&quot; and only one tone, that shows which syllable has to be heightened. Oh, and we still use a lot of ancient words &quot;as is&quot;, without having to use the weird forms of &quot;katharevousa&quot;. So i really don't know what that &quot;correction process&quot; you are talking about is.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps we need a new Greek type thread? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The change in fashion of Greek type design to which Hrant refers is not intrinsically related to either the change from polytonic to monotonic (never complete) or the longer history of language change. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Greek graphic designers and publishers wanted types that were 'modern' and which looked as much as possible like the popular Latin types of the time. Linotype, who had a virtual monopoly on typesetting systems in Greece, duly provided Greek designs of bestselling families like Helvetica, Baskerville and New Century Schoolbook. In all these designs, drawn by Matthew Carter, a deliberate effort was made to introduce as many Latin forms as possible, and to attach serifs wherever possible (Matthew jokes that he was surprised the Greek clients didn't ask for serifs on Helvetica). The proportions of the letters in these designs derive directly from the Latin (themselves constrained by the unit measurements of previous typesetting systems), rather than being tailored to the Greek alphabet and the frequency of letter combinations in typical Greek texts. Wherever possible, Greek letters were formed simply by adding to, subtracting from or rotating Latin forms; the Helvetica Greek lowercase sigma, for example, is simply a latin o with a stick coming out the side. To be fair to Matthew and his colleagues at Linotype, who now acknowledge that these designs are neither attractive in themselves nor authentically Greek, it is necessary to state again that this is what the Greek market wanted. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In 2001, when Linotype asked me to work with them to develop a large 'core font' version of Helvetica supporting multiple scripts. I suggested that we redesign the Cyrillic and Greek from scratch, rather than using Matthew's 1970s version. Linotype deserve a round of applause for agreeing to this and paying for the design of a new, more authentic Greek rather than using what they already had. It's still Helvetica, of course, so there is only so much one can do in the way of beauty and readability, but I think this comparison illustrates the difference in approach to Greek type design as it has changed over the past thirty years: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

What principle are you using to determine whether stems are straight or curved?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you mean pi or psi? I'm guessing the latter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It came down to a question of what works: the upsilon desperately needs the entry stroke and the curved right side. I could have carried this over to the psi, but I didn't want the whole design becoming too cursive: I wanted to maintain some of the rigidity that is a hallmark of Helvetica. The psi works okay with the straight sides, and is a much less common letter than upsilon, so I think it can afford to carry the rigidity.</div>

So the further it is from other letters (and not necessarily just those in its own alphabet) the better - as long as the requirements of decipherability and &quot;belonging&quot; are adequately met. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The most important parts of a letter are its acrocratic features. Often there are things other letters don't have - in the case of the sigma, its horizontal protrusion. So you could say that the sigma is a stick with a &quot;o&quot; coming out of it!  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But ideally you want to reduce the &quot;o&quot;-ness of its &quot;o&quot;, maybe even by breaking it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">i went through my book. unfortunately it didnt have much info. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the 15th-18th century most greek fonts were based on calligraphy and handwriting. From the beginning of the 19th century until today there have been some unique greek fonts, many feature serifs and remind us of byzantine writing. In the 50's most typographers used linotype, in the 60's it was monotype and in the 70's it was offset and phototypesetting. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here are a couple of pics  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first one is self-explanatory i guess <!-- raw HTML omitted -->second one was printed 1952, it's from the textbook of first grade - elementary school (they kept that book intact for 20-25 years) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last one is my silly handwritting, just pointing out alternative ways of drawing some of the letters <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about the sigma sign, most ppl use the alternative way of drawing it, as it shows in 03.gif above. The sigma is for sure one stroked without reversal , and the way to draw it is to start making the circle from the highest point at the top and when you finish it to draw the horizontal line, all in one stroke (if you start by making the line first, you'll eventually end up making the alternative version). What i meant by that &quot;in essence the sigma is an o with a line coming out of it&quot; is that geometrically, that's what distinguishes it from the rest of the letters. How do you know that the shape you are looking at is in fact a sigma?</div>
