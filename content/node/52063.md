    more unique. whetehr you referenced AT&T or Domo ... they're almost identical.

  body: "Globe itself has been well overused especially in logistics business. I think
    if you want a globe in your logo, you have a very tough job to do to make it stand
    out from the rest and already designed (memorable or not).\r\n\r\nsimply enter
    \"global logo\" into Google Image search and you'll see all those results. Many
    many companies use globe in some shape or form. You'll probably get something
    similar with other search terms as well.\r\n\r\nI don't want to say \"Forget about
    the globe stylisation\" I'm just saying you're in a tough place to make it work
    and to not look like a rip-off of some other logo. Take BT for instance. Very
    innovative and distinct but still \"globe\". One of the best to my idea of a great
    logo.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
