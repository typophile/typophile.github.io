body: "Here's my problem:\r\n\r\nI need to do a business card for a fitness company.
  The keywords I'd like to see typeset are Natural and Fitness. But the face can't
  be too feminine--the company sells products to women and men alike, but the card
  will be for the head of the company who is a body-builder and tends to like strong
  styling and something that pops.\r\n\r\nIn regards to that last sentence, one product
  that sells through the company currently uses GeoSlab (extra bold and in caps).\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  there's something that might work harmoniously with the Geoslab face and still speaks
  to the requirement for being Natural.\r\n\r\nAnything come to mind? Thanks. I'm
  stumped and looking for inspiration."

    distinctly soft or \u2018natural\u2019 without being overly feminine. I might
    even call the extra bold weight muscular.\r\n\r\nIs something like [[http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/anchor/|Anchor]]
    too soft/rounded?\r\n\r\nWhat is the GeoSlab font you mention? Is it [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-slabserif-712/|one]]
    of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-slabserif-703/|these?]]\r\nPerhaps
    just a thinner weight of what has already been used could do the trick..."

  body: "Yes it's one of those Geo's.\r\n\r\n\r\nHmm...you may be right about the
    thinner weight. I really did think the light weight was quite pretty the other
    day.\r\n\r\nThe card was quickly designed using a lot of black to match a pop-up
    banner, hence the thins didn't look so hot. But, being \"natural,\" I decided
    it really needs to be a white/negative space type of card, so I'll try again using
    the thinner weights.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions may still be relevant but I think
    it's probably answered.\r\n\r\nThanks Aaron"
