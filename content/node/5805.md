body: Hi, I wasn&#39;t sure where to post this question... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking
  for a font that has all the letters overlined. It seems to be the only way to use
  overlined characters in Powerpoint, and those tend to be handy for scientific presentations.
  As long as the letters themselves are rather simple - no fancy stuff or anything
  - I&#39;ll be happy with about anything you might know about. TIA.

    mean something line <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FF00296102P2"
    target="_blank"> this</a> or something like <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=LI15330149P1"
    target="_blank"> this</a>?

  body: Uhm... Neither. I meant overlined as in opposite to underlined, so with a
    line going above the characters... <BR>Kind of like Header 1 over <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_text-decoration">here</a>
    - except that&#39;s css, not a font by itself.

    typically achieve by using text or paragraph styles.

  body: Yes... Problem is, Powerpoint has a very limited range of those, and both
    me and my father &#40;who&#39;s the intended user of the font&#41; have searched
    the thing thoroughly and found nothing that could be of use. <BR>Unfortunately,
    if no one here knows of any font like that, I&#39;ll have to either create a font
    myself &#40;a first for me&#41; or create appropriate images and work with those,
    which is a none too nice prospect. <BR>Hence my still holding out hope that someone
    here might know of something, somewhere, that looks somewhat similar. <BR>Either
    way, thanks for the quick response, Yves - very much appreciated!

  body: The closest I can think of that has only lines above the letters is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/simran-itc/simran-itc/testdrive.html?s=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&amp;p=24"
    target="_blank">ITC Simran</a>. Most of the uppercase letters have &#39;overlines&#39;,
    as you called them, but some of those with ascenders do not. <BR> <BR>I know two
    fonts with lines over and under the letters, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be what
    you want. <BR> <BR>Offhand, I would say using a blank underline in the line above
    a character would be your easiest method to accomplish this. Depending on the
    application you are using &#40;such as Word?&#41;, that might not be easy, because
    of the ways MS tries to &#39;help&#39; you format everything.

  body: If your using powerpoint, click on View, Toolbars and enable the Drawing toolbar.  It
    normally will be at the bottom of the window.  You can then draw a line to the
    proper length and place it above the letters.  You can then right click the line
    to adjust it width properties.

  body: Apparently, you can have overlining if you can use Unicode -aware software.
    See the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/unicode/203e/" target="_blank">information
    from MyFonts.com</a>. <BR> <BR>I tried my suggestion about a blank underline above
    the letters, and it would only work in Word if you used a Tab.  Not likely to
    be useful that way. <BR> <BR>I also have the nagging impression that I saw a new
    font recently that had an overline for all the lower case characters, but I can&#39;t
    recall where I saw it. <BR> <BR>I think the Unicode approach sounds the most promising,
    if someone knows of applications that can use that protocol.

  body: Hmm, got new info from dad - apparently, what he really wants &#40;wish he&#39;d
    told me earlier&#41; is just the lowercase letters &#39;bcdnpqstu&#39; be available
    &#34;overlined&#34;, and, preferably, all the standard letters and numbers in
    the same style.  At least if I end up creating the font from scratch, I won&#39;t
    have a lot of work, heh... <BR> <BR>Out of curiosity, could you post the links
    to the two fonts you mentioned with lines over and under, Mike? <BR> <BR>Doubtful
    if blank underlines will work in Powerpoint. Any sensible program, yeah, but I
    doubt it as far as MS is concerned. <BR> <BR>As far as the Drawing thing is concerned,
    yes, I know about that, thank you, Bill.  The problem is that drawing these every
    few seconds is bound to get tiring, and the slideshow my father&#39;s preparing
    is gonna be full of them. <BR> <BR>Unicode-wise, I&#39;ll have to see if I can
    work that into Powerpoint - might be my best chance yet &#40;though I still doubt
    MS products and their workability, so we&#39;ll see&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, thanks!
