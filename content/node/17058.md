  (we're a small company, so I am an IT girl too among other many things :D), I get
  a whole bunch of useless/ugly/just weird fonts installed too. Even worse things
  get, if someone new is smart enough to download some of the \"10 000 free fonts\"
  collections available on filesharing servers (most of which are illegal and useless
  anyway) and install them to proudly demonstrate their abilities. I believe in the
  'less is more' philosophy and for many reasons try to remove as many of them as
  I dare. \r\n\r\nSo can anyone provide me a list with the essential fonts that Windows
  and web pages commonly use, so I would be sure as to what I can throw out without
  much harm done :)?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thank you so much :)). As for the platform - that is a corporate choice, as
    I would much prefer using Macs. Windows is common among small DTP businesses here
    (eastern europe) because of the (local) cost advantages - Apple retailers are
    still expensive. But then again - recently the performance gap between apple/pc
    has become a lot less noticeable given that we use Adobe CS for all we do.

    the fonts folder you will likely be okay - the absolutely essential system fonts
    like Tahoma and Microsoft Sans Serif are \"system file protected\" so \"come back\"
    if you manage to delete them.\r\n\r\nYou could also invest in suitcase or another
    font management utility. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n\r\n"

    body: "Nay, I did it wrong one time and the system worked fine, but all the type
      looked very funny, aparently the missing font was substituted by something else.\r\nSoftware
      investments are still painful topic here :)). Although we have finaly managed
      to go fully legal, the costs still hurt, as the sofware prices are western,
      but our income - post-soviet :D, which means about 4-5 times less. But I have
      included several copies of Suitcase in our 2006 shopping list. :))"

    [[FontExplorer X]]. FontExplorer is just a tool to view and search for Linotype
    fonts.\r\n\r\n\"FontExplorer X\" is the a font management tool from Linotype,
    which will additionally let customers easily purchase and install fonts from Linotype
    and other foundries on their computers. Currently, it is only available as a beta-program
    for Mac OS X. But the full version for Mac, and a public beta version for Windows,
    will be available soon.\r\n\r\nSo, unfortunately, PC users aren't able to manage
    their fonts with FontExplorer X just yet. Sorry for the confusion."

    comes as part of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 12.\r\n\r\nHowever, a fully-functional
    version is included in the trial download of CorelDRAW Grahics Suite 12.\r\n\r\nSimply
    download the trial version (you will need to sign up to Corel's website, if you
    have not already).  When installing, use a custom installation - choosing only
    to install BitStream Font Navigator (it is in the Utilities section).\r\n\r\nIt
    is free, easy to use, quick, and has pretty much all the necessary features.\r\n"
