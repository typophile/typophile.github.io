body: Today is a sad day for the company where I work. My supervisor had an heart
  attack and is on hospital with a very reserved coma status. He his 35 years old,
  and like many of us had a very stressed &#34;modern&#34; life. I come from a very
  small village and I&#39;ve seen my family with no stress whatsoever. I usually spent
  8 hours on work before a computer, go home eat something, and usually go and work
  freelancer more 4-5 hours a day... I wonder if it&#39;s necessary all of this. Modern
  life...

    mean we have to. Any suggestions aside from becoming a train robber?

  body: 'Adriano, that&#39;s very sad. <BR>The one thing that I think helps a lot
    is this: don&#39;t buy any of the junk they want us to buy. Cut your debt, and
    they lose most of their power over you. If your social circle looks down on not
    buying crap, look for another social circle. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Boy, good advice, Hrant. <BR> <BR>Debt reduction and freedom from feeling
    like I just &#42;have&#42; to buy stuff has been the focus of my household the
    last few years. <BR> <BR>We are not anti-stuff. We just feel like we want to be
    free of it - get rid of its hold on us. We still enjoy things. <BR> <BR>Too bad
    about the fellow struggling for his life now. It seems to be a roll of the dice.
    Genetics, environment, temperment ...etc. <BR> <BR>Live every day as if it is
    your last - love you family and friends. Sounds sappy, but it is true.

  body: In the end it&#39;s exactly that. Live every day. And Hrant, I totally agree
    with you... altough I&#39;m looking for a house and I&#39;ll soon make the big
    debt. <BR> <BR>Last news, he&#39;s out of danger, let&#39;s see what happens.

    20 minutes, look away from your work and spend 20 seconds focusing on something
    in the distance.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Similarlry, checking in on Typophile and maybe
    making a post also helps relieve the pressure. But every 20 minutes would be a
    bit excessive.'

  body: My problem is that I love the work, and find it difficult to turn down an
    interesting sounding project, even if I already have too much on my plate. Recently,
    I started finding creative ways to deal with this, such as inviting colleagues
    to collaborate on projects, so I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m under a mountain
    of work that is only getting heavier, but this is only possible because I&#39;m
    100% my own boss. I feel really sorry for the people who are overworked through
    someone else&#39;s decision; at least I know I have only myself to blame.

  body: I also think that the only reason why I sit again at home doing the &#34;same
    thing&#34; but with extra feeling and with more passion is because I LOVE WHAT
    I DO. This takes so much time and energy from my life that i have the same problem
    as you John H. I just can&#39;t turn off this design way of life. I don&#39;t
    know if this will change with time &#40;kids &amp; other extras <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41; but we&#39;ll see. On this last year I also got a
    pile of work that I&#39;ve accepted &#40;with no time at all to do a good job&#41;
    and got my friends to work on these projects. On the first years I did everything
    and this is a serious mistake. <BR> <BR>That 20/20 rule is a good idea! <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the good vibes and support.
