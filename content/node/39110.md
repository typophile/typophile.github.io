  historical models in contemporary graphic design. Case in point, uncial typefaces
  do nothing for me, but the solution Janno Hahn came up with is very interesting
  and beautifully designed (yes, the outlines are indeed a bit rugged as they were
  truly hand drawn). As <a href=\"http://www.typographer.org/\">David</a> puts it:
  <em>\"It really is lovely to see such letterforms being updated and used in a modern
  context, (...)\".</em>\r\n\r\nYou can see it in <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=235\">my
  Unzipped blog</a>, complete with sketches and production images. I'm curious to
  find out what some of you think of it."

    finding a new way to handle uncial speaks to how much room for creative interpretation
    is out there. And when we explore those old letterforms we get a great new perspective
    on the letters we use every day now. Or at least I do, and but I\u2019ve been
    practicing my uncials a lot lately."
