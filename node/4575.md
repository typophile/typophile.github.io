  body: Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.dolcegabbana.it/"> link</a> for D&amp;G.
    <BR>Looks like Futura. Not sure what exact version, though.

  body: 'Very close to Futura but there are some differences: the G and B for example,
    and in the weight of Futura that best matches the logo, which is Futura regular
    &#40;not book, heavy, etc&#41; the points of the N and the A would still be sharp.
    I dunno... so it could be customized or a Futura knockoff.'

  body: That is definitely not Avant Garde. Look at the &#39;G&#39;.

  body: Nah, it&#39;s a version of Futura. Can&#39;t explain the cut-off  <BR>bits
    on the A and N, but all the other earmarks point  <BR>to Futura. Customized? Could
    be.
