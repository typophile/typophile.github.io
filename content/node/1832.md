  body: The typeface is named <b>Traffic Mager Alternate</b> &#40;found embedded in
    the following PDF example&#41;, but I&#39;ll be darned if I can find who designed
    it or where it came from. It may be a custom design. The closest commercial match
    I can come up with is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/rotis-sans-serif/light-45/testdrive.html?s=bulthaup&amp;p=48">Rotis
    Sans Serif Light 45</a>. The bottom story of the &#39;a&#39; is a different shape
    and the overall character width is wider than the logo. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19358.jpg"

  body: Good eye gents! Definitely a  modified Rotis Sans.  Love that lowercase b.
    <BR> <BR>&#34;Thwack&#34; &#40;sound of me smacking my head against desk for not
    knowing such a popular face&#41;. You ever forget how to spell the simplest of
