  the type used in this Canvas wordmark.\r\n\r\nIt looks like Gustan [[http://vllg.com/LuxTypo/Gustan#panel=usage-poster]]
  but it's lighter and more extended, with with some slightly different features.
  It's entirely possible that it is custom, but thought I'd give it a shot here.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be most appreciated."
