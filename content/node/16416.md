body: "Hi everyone, my challenge is this: Identify all the typefaces used in the old
  CCAC stationary for both campuses.\r\n\r\nSome back story...\r\nI'm doing my thesis
  project on breaking graphic design...yadayadayada...Bob Aufuldish a professor here
  at CCA made this stationary which breaks the rule of never use more then five typefaces
  at one time for anything...yadayadayada..Michael Vanderbyl said to name all the
  faces instead of just showing the stationary...\r\n\r\nI don't have an extensive
  knowledge of the typefaces out there to know what all these faces are. I have found
  a few: Crafts (picture 2) is Rockwell, architecture design (picture 5) is Scala
  Sans Caps, and I think Art (picture 5) is Bodoni.\r\n\r\nI have some other guesses:
  Oakland (picture 2) is Bembo, edu and Oakland (picture 2) is maybe in the Clarendon
  family, Oakland (picture 6) is Walbaum, and that's all I have so far. \r\n\r\nAny
  help is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nFerdinand"

    I know it can't be that.\r\n\r\nCan someone verify this?\r\n\r\nFerdinand"
