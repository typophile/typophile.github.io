  body: "This is a rather strange combination of fonts...\r\nAll lowercase except
    the long-tail /y must be <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=P22&ffam=P22%20Corinthia%20-%20Regular&fid=3eaed38d0ec2784e5f44551d10cba7ee&fsize=60&text=Always%20on%20my%20mind%20Forever%20in%20my%20heart&wrap=2|Corinthia]]</strong>
    by P22 or TypeSETit\r\nThe letters /A & /F look like <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Google-Web-Fonts&ffam=Ruthie%20-%20Regular&fid=e63dc5e4c2f153092c3b441994426045&fsize=60&text=Always%20on%20my%20mind%20Forver%20in%20my&wrap=2|Ruthie]]</strong>
    from P22 or TypeSETit (now also part of Google Web Fonts)\r\nFor /A & /F there
    is also a font called <strong>\"Love (Light)\"</strong> (no designer/foundry data)
    which looks like a Ruthie clone and includes the small red hearts/lines on letters
    left."
