  experiments with \"low branching\" letters (as described in [[http://typophile.com/node/48608|this
  earlier blog entry]]).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/branchingvslooping_6342.png]\r\n^
  comparing low-branching vs. looping (the sketch that started my thinking [[http://www.typophile.com/node/48728|in
  this blog entry]]).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/loopingletters_4361.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/loopingletters2_5802.png]\r\n^^
  more looping stems\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pstems_4965.png]\r\n^
  some very crude figuring on stems of p. I realized that p and d work differently
  than b, q, r, n, etc., in that the doubled-up part of the stem is much longer, so
  it will call for a different but cohesive solution."
