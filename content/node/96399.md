  newspaper'. Can someone identify the headline font that reads \"Bustlin' Buena Vista
  St!\"  It may be a new unique Disney font, just as the newspaper's nameplate obviously
  is a unique design.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BuenaVistaBugleSample_6433.jpg]\r\n\r\n

  body: "Thank you. That 'narrow'ed it down. It looks more like an ITC Garamond Bold
    Condensed, further condensed by an additional 85% or so.  There are still some
    very  minor differences, such as the curvature of the B's top  and the extreme
    skinniness of the right single quote.\r\n\r\nI guess I never looked far enough
    down the list when I passed the image to WhatFontIs. \r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\n
