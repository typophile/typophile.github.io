  not nuts and I did see it - it seems to have disappeared...\r\n\r\nDoes anyone remember
  it, and if you did, do you recall what the font pairings were?\r\n\r\nIt appears
  I'll be using Disturbance for a wordmark and have gone through a slew of pairing
  fonts for the tagline - nothing thrills me, so I thought I'd take a gander at the
  forum suggestions, but now can't find the darn post.\r\n\r\nCheers! \r\n\r\n "
