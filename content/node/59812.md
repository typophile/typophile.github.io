body: "Well, sort of. \r\n\r\nYears ago I made a font called Allatuq when I was doing
  some work with the Baffin Divisional Board of Education in what is now Nunavut (but
  was still Northwest Territories then). The font contained The basic Latin ASCII
  characters and what Inuktitut characters we could fit into an 8-bit \"MacInuit\"
  character set we developed. \r\n\r\nThe font was to look hand-drawn, as though by
  a child\u2014so it hasn't not really got anything to do with Comic Sans, which was
  designed to imitate comic book lettering. In fact, even though Comic Sans came out
  in 1994, and I made Allatuq in 1997 (the 1.0 release was Patrick's Day 1998), I
  doubt if I'd even heard of Comic Sans when I was designing Allatuq. Here's a sample
  of the 1.0 Syllabics glyphs. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/allatuq-10_5677.gif]\r\n\r\nWhen
  the opportunity came to revise the font for the Kativik School Board in Qu\xE9bec,
  I decided it would be best to re-draw everything from scratch. And... well, being
  me, I decided to add support for more characters. First I added support for a fairly
  large set of Latin characters, including the IPA block, gods know why. Then I decided
  I'd better add support for the entire set of Canadian Syllabics, and then it occurred
  to me that Greek would be fun, and Cyrillic, and Hebrew. I guess I'm doomed. It'll
  have to be Cherokee and Georgian next...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Allatuq-20_5949.png]\r\n\r\nBefore
  I release the font, however, I thought it would be nice to try to get some feedback
  on it. So without more apology, here is a [[http://www.evertype.com/fonts/syllabics/Allatuq-20090709.pdf|three-page
  PDF with some samples]]. Critique?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Heh. First feedback received on the Hebrew:\r\n\r\n\"Oof. What's there sticks
    out badly. I think you should use script letterforms. Or even print ones that
    look more hand-drawn; these don't to my eye. Even the text color is off; it's
    much lighter than the surrounding paragraphs. Script can look denser.\"\r\n\r\nHe's
    right. Back to the drawing board for the Hebrew.\r\n\r\nMichael Everson\r\nevertype.com"
