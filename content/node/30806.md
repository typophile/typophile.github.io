body: "I am coming into my final year at Univeristy which basically consists of a
  major project where I need to research an area of interest and come up with a creative
  design solution. I have a strong interest in Letterpress and was wanting to bass
  my major project around this somehow. I've been having trouble \r\ncoming up with
  some basic directions to start with. I want to avoid any negativity towards technology
  etc. Does anyone have any interesting ideas or directions that could help?"

  body: You should try getting in touch with the people who produce the letterpress
    items in the Chicago headquarters of The Paper Source. They're probably the largest
    producer of letterpress items in the US.
