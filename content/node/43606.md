  body: Rob, a little more respect please. Try using a title that explains what you're
    trying to ID. Like "hype, rounded sans." It's a little more helpful and a lot
    less degrading.

  body: "<cite>Sorry Andrew.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt's cool, we can take a joke here as long
    as it's respectful. \r\n\r\nKeep it in mind for the future. Yves carries a banhammer
    of the gods. It's similar to Thor's hammer Mjollnir, but much more powerful in
    the realm of Typophiles."
