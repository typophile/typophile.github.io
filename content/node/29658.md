  5 I have created an Opentype-font which works fine in Adobe-apps, Word, etc., and
  also in Quark xPress 6.5. Not every feature is available of course, but the basics
  work fine.\r\n\r\nI can type and print the font, create PDFs with Acrobat 7 (via
  file --> print), but if I use the internal feature in xpress to create a PDF, the
  font does not seem to be embedded. All I get is an empty PDF document, and in the
  document properties, the font is not listed.\r\n\r\nI've tried other fonts (type1
  and opentype) not created by me, and they work fine, so I must have done something
  wrong :). The font-info in Fontlab says that font embedding is allowed.\r\n\r\nCan
  anybody tell me what the problem might be?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\nSebastian"

    that sort of thing."
