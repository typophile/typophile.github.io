  body: I didnt get the junior jazz pic, looks normal to me. This list has been done
    several times, but I think i saw a few new ones. They forgot the USA (tv network)
    logo, which looks like penises.

  body: "To 'get' the junior jazz pic, don't focus on the two individual figures,
    but look at the picture as a whole, treating the black as outlines.\r\n\r\nThe
    A-Style logo is intentionally crass, I believe, whereas the others are probably
    genuine mistakes (although you do begin to wonder)."
