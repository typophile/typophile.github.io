  the Greek alphabet, and one for Russian (Cyrillic). \r\n\r\nText is meant to be
  set in 1730, in an old book.\r\n\r\nThis is a time-sensitive request -- thanks for
  any help you can provide!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nMary "

  body: "Thanks so much, you all. VERY much appreciated. I'm dialect coach for the
    NBC TV show GRIMM, and also provide all written language requirements for the
    show, which are plentiful! When doing so, ordinarily I'm seeking written translations
    that the art dept then \"handwrites,\" fundamentally copying the typed text. This
    works for Latin and many other foreign languages, but the dept hasn't got the
    skillset to effectively navigate the Cyrillic accurately. \r\n\r\nThis will hopefully
    provide a solution. In the meantime I'm hoping my original translators take on
    handwriting it for us, if need be.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\nMary McDonald-Lewis"
