  with some interest, as I have found myself in a somewhat related predicament. I'm
  going to be doing layout and typesetting of a small periodical that aspires to be
  a scholarly journal (it isn't quite, but the people publishing it like to think
  that it is...) and am making new templates, because it was previously done in Quark
  and I use InDesign. I don't much care for the present look - 10/11 Stone Serif,
  4p6 margin all around, headings in Stone Serif semibold - so I intend to alter the
  design some. Just to make the context clear, the content of this periodical tends
  to be historical, mostly but not entirely in the 1800 to 1950 time range.\r\n\r\nThe
  one fixed point is that the logo, which is on the cover and first interior page,
  uses Arnold Boecklin. This is such a floridly art nouveau face that it seems the
  obvious thing to do is go with that theme in the design. I can just about see something
  like Korinna, or maybe Magister Book, for display use, but then what would work
  as a text face? The obvious period faces that are suitable are mostly moderns like
  Century Expanded, which seem like the sort of thing art nouveau was reacting against.
  What did art nouveau designers use when they needed to set large amounts of text
  fairly unobtrusively? Perhaps one of the early old-style revivals like Cheltenham?
  (that one's probably not right for this use, though)\r\n\r\nOr is art nouveau so
  contradictory to the aesthetic of scholarly journals that I might better forget
  it, pretend the logo isn't there, and design it around some other idea entirely?"

  body: "How about Clearface?\r\nIt's a progressive face of the early 20th century
    on several counts, with the mother of all modernist type names.\r\nFirstly, its
    design strategy addresses legibility in as logical a response to scientific reading
    theory as has ever been made. (It would be interesting to know more of how it
    was tested in prototype.) \r\nSecondly, the way it does that is somewhat organic
    (hence connection to art nouveau) in the \"extra\" lower-case balled terminals,
    which grow on \"branches\" which sprout from the main stems in a curvy way--like
    round seed husks as seedlings push them towards the sky. (The \"r\" is very nice.)\r\nThirdly,
    it's proportions are compact and develop upon the evolutionary line that runs
    from the original didones, through the scotch moderns, to the more sturdily rendered
    Century styles of the early 20th century.\r\nFourthly, it is a member of the first
    sans + serif mega-family -- and you can get a lot of mileage out of the sans side.\r\n"

    out to see how they work.

    I'd chime in and suggest <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/windsor/\">Windsor</a>.
    However I don't believe it has enough versatility for academic text setting, whereas
    Goudy Sans or Clearface clearly would have \u2013 a blurring of these distinct
    notions might produce a choice like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=bookman\">Bookman</a>

  body: These are great suggestions everyone; they're all helping me see this in different
    ways. I think Windsor may not quite work for extended text, but it does highlight
    a possible connection - Windsor and Belwe both have an element of Venetian in
    them. Belwe might pair well with an early 20th-cent. Venetian like Centaur, although
    the swashes on V and W might be a bit too flamboyant in this use. I'm not sure
    if Windsor contrasts enough to be useful as display type with a Venetian, but
    it's certainly in the right spirit for something that nods to both art nouveau
    and academic sobriety. And Korinna is in somewhat the same position with regard
    to Bookman.
