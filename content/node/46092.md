  in my font and playing with kerning in Metrics Window everything looks fine in FS,
  but when I generate the font file there is no kerning applied to the kerning pairs
  I defined. It's hard to say if the kerning isn't applied at all or just in some
  cases. I even tried to define the kerning classes but it didn't help. Please help
  me."

    applications programs, where if there are no substitutions (a G-sub table), the
    G-pos table (positioning, which includes kerning) isn't applied.\r\n\r\nIn FontLab,
    try writing a ligature feature, make sure you add the kerning to the features,
    recompile the features, and see if the font doesn't work properly.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ad 1. First I saw that the kerning isn't there on the sample text when I
    opened the font file. Then I installed the font and checked it in different applications
    like Corel Draw, MS Word, Photoshop - still not working.\r\n\r\nAd 2. Is this
    kerning thing FS's 5.0.0 bug?\r\n\r\ncharles_e: kerning isn't working both in
    open type and true type font files. What is this ligature feature? Can you explain
    to me what you wrote in the last sentence?"

  body: OpenType works via a series of features. You're going to have to read the
    FontLab manual, it is far too big a topic to address here -- at least, for me.
