  body: "Hmm. I guess I use the word nondescript to describe fonts that are boring.
    If I alter my usage, then yes, Gotham doesn't call a lot of attention to itself
    and yet maintains a certain amount authoriy. So, ok ok, yes Gotham is nondescript.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "No offense to Gotham or its makers. I love the face as well. In this limited
    context, I simply didn't recognize it. By \"nondescript\" I meant that it lacked
    any distinguishing features that could be used in an online search of most font
    sources. You're right, Stephen. The beauty of Gotham is in its understated simplicty.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again, all."
