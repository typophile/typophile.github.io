  body: "I find it a bit ironic that the two two faces she seems best known for (Trajan
    and Lithos) are adaptations of literally ancient designs, if I recall correctly.
    Even Goudy had a go at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/goudy-trajan/\">Trajan</a>
    in 1930 (Revived by Jason Castle).\r\n\r\nShe won the Morisawa award for <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/mirarae/\">'Mirarae'</a>,
    but you don't see that too often.\r\n\r\nMy personal favorite of hers, in a completely
    different vein is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/nueva/\">'Nueva'</a>,
    a lively, casual font that has a great range of color and utility, where you are
    not trying to weigh down the world with 'meaning' and importance.\r\n\r\n - Mike

  body: "Yes Yves, but would you say it is Oscar material solely because of the strength
    of the typeface, or because at this point it is a precedent? When did it start
    spawning in the movie industry anyway?\r\n\r\n>Even Goudy had a go at Trajan in
    1930\r\n\r\nSo did Tschichold, and so many others!"

  body: I convinced this is just a stupid case of there having been a precedent at
    some point. Hollywood execs aren't the most imaginative bunch -- just look at
    the movies they produce. :^P
