  body: "This looks like a 'FrankenFont Monster\".  Whatever you use to re-create
    this thing, it will take some work, but my suggestion is to start with a somewhat
    similar narrow sans, such as <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/diosa-rubia-nf/\">Diosa
    Rubia</a> from Nick Curtis. Then find (or draw) some rounded serifs to start grafting
    them on the sans letters.Some parts of the sans letters will need to be amputated
    first, like the top arm of the Z. The A is the only letter that is not approximately
    uniform stroke weight, but you could make that from the left half of the V (as
    the right leg) and then add a thinner left leg. The C might need a graft from
    a narrow serif C.\r\n\r\nFrankly, it's a mess, but if you gotta, you gotta, I
    guess.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I would suggest you trace it in Adobe Illustrator - will save a  bunch of
    time - use a high dpi scan.

  body: "I'll second the Illustrator suggestion, though my tool of choice is FreeHand.
    I worked in a print shop for years and had to recreate logos all the time, and
    with practice it goes really fast. I'd say this logo, with its geometric forms
    and repeated elements, would take under an hour to recreate with vectors.\r\n"
