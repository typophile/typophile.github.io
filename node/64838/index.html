<p>Unfortunately, there just isn&rsquo;t much demand for hand-crafted pixel fonts anymore these days. Furthermore, given the wide range of physical DPI resolution of the displays in use, it&rsquo;s likely that any given pixel font would be either too large or too small for any given user. (In my case, your pixel font is significantly too small to be practical for workhorse use.)</p>
<p>Nice job, though.</p>

<p>Same here, but
(a) it looks very much like an existing terminal font that comes with some Linux distros (I used it for several years, but never learned its name, sorry)
(b) I personally don&rsquo;t like f and r are serif&rsquo;ed
(c) it doesn&rsquo;t beat [[http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/|Dina]], because nothing does :)</p>

<p>Apankrat, to address your comments,</p>
<p>(a) I suppose that means it&rsquo;s a decent design. :)</p>
<p>(b) I took out the serifs on those fonts to see the difference, and I don&rsquo;t think I like the change. Maybe I&rsquo;m just used to the serifs being there by now, and you&rsquo;re used to them being absent (in Dina, for example). To me, it feels like if the i, j, l, and (almost) t have serifs, then the f should have one too. Here&rsquo;s a picture for comparison.
![](/images/old-images/cn serif noserif_3834.PNG)</p>
<p>(c) It was in fact after being frustrated with Dina that I decided to make this font. It&rsquo;s been so long since I designed the font (I just realized it&rsquo;s been about three years since I made it, not one as I stated above) that I can&rsquo;t remember exactly what the issues were. I have a feeling, though, that Dina felt too wide (it&rsquo;s 7 pixels wide whereas this is 6): my lines were disappearing off the screen and I saw there was wasted space between the letters.</p>
<p>Now, suppose I want to publish this online as a free font. Where&rsquo;s the best place to do that?</p>

<p>What format is the font in now?</p>
<p>If you want to make a TTF of it, you could rebuild it with <a href="http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/">Fontstruct</a> and share it there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">The League Of Movable Type</a> is another option.</p>
<p>(Of course you could just put it up on your own website if you have one, but the places I mentioned are more likely to generate some interest for your font.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">As an occasional programmer, I like the 1ilI disparity and especially the curly brackets. I would have to compare side by side with other options to judge the rest of it. I can&rsquo;t remember what font I use, but ProggyFonts.com has some good ones. I don&rsquo;t know if they would accept a submission as it were, but it&rsquo;s something to look at.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Perhaps this is too late, but I have a few comments.</p>
<p>First, this is pretty good, I think. It does remind me a lot of Terminus (the font I use in my Linux Terminal). Other characters remind me of the terminal font it switches to on boot (no idea what that&rsquo;s called). If I can I&rsquo;d like to get a copy of this (in a bitfont format) for use in my terminal.</p>
<p>I have a few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Curly brackets are not exactly alike, I think the leftward one needs work.</li>
<li>Colon and semicolon should be raised to x-height</li>
<li>The a, c, s, and other characters appear to be trying to use less pixels, however the r and f are complicated with serifs in a way no other characters are.</li>
<li>For a font intended to be used in terminals, it has some pretty lofty ascenders and descenders. They look good, but that&rsquo;s not the goal in a terminal font.</li>
<li>Your lines are also a little farther apart than they should be. You&rsquo;ve minimized space very well horizontally, but vertically not so well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, the height of ascenders and descenders may or may not be a problem. It probably depends on preferences. I would like to see a bitfont file though (like .bdf), that would be useful to me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This thread is most likely dead, but I&rsquo;ll vouch for the f and r serifs. I think it makes the font more readable. With a terminal font, consistency is less important, and anyway, the letters you should be looking at as ones that stand out are the unserifed d and b. But these are good choices too because they are more legible because of it (their extra width is something I really like about this font).</p>
<p>To me, the vertical spacing seems comfortable, but like you said, that&rsquo;s just personal preference.</p>
<p>As for the colon and semicolon, I think being in the middle of the x-height is not a big deal. You could claim that it helped distinguish them, but I&rsquo;m not sure it would be much of an advantage. I would be more concerned about the weight, because the colon seems pretty easy to overlook. I will say that I love the disparity between the two though. Because of that thick comma, it&rsquo;s very easy to tell them apart.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry, Brian, for contradicting almost everything you said, but that&rsquo;s how I feel about this font.</p>
