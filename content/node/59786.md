  in type design (primarily in the US but also the UK). I'm personally not looking
  to apply in the immediate future, just interested in learning about places to consider
  down the line. \r\n\r\nAlso, what are people's thoughts/arguments for the necessity
  of a concentrated masters in typography to practicing the profession? Are there
  shorter-term certificate programs out there you think would be as beneficial as
  a two-year graduate course?"

    type designer, just start designing type. Go draw yourself 40 or 50 fonts and
    if there are still things you haven't figured out, either go to grad school or
    find another job."

    I agree with James on both points too, you''re going to have to be more resourceful
    and start making stuff now. Even the successful people who have attended those
    programs were already making somewhat decent stuff before. '

  body: "Read the archives. There isn't really a dedicated type design program in
    the US. The only program in the UK is the one at Reading. I believe it is a faster
    way to boost your skills than practicing on your own, but as you see from James'
    comments above, that is not a universal opinion.\r\n\r\nI agree that you need
    to have spent some noticeable time up front doing type design and studying before
    going to grad school. You'd probably need to have done so just to get in, anyway.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I think a MA in type design will significantly accelerate your learning of
    the craft, and both T&M and MATD are excellent courses that are quite different.
    But then, I'm just finishing the Reading MATD, and I think the course is AWESOME,
    so I'm a little biased :-)
