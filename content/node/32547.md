  in development. It\u2019s a Baroque typeface (a somewhat decorative Modern). Two
  styles need to be kerned (Light & Bold), with 800 glyphs per style (uppercase and
  lowercase Latin West & CE, small caps, swash capitals, final lowercase swashes,
  OsF and a few ligatures). Approx. 600 kerning pairs already exist. \r\n\r\nPlease
  write to adam at twardoch dot com. \r\n\r\nAdam"
