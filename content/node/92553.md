  Saving Fund' sign.  It looks somewhat similar to Avant Garde Gothic Book and Futura
  Book, but is slightly different.  Thanks for your help!\r\n\r\n-Toby\r\n\r\nHere
  is the image:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/philadelphia_5093.jpg]"

  body: "If this sample comes from a metal or hand-painted sign, it's possible that
    you aren't going to find a match with an extant typeface: you may only get bits
    and pieces to match.\r\n\r\nFor example, the sharp vertices on the A and V aren't
    carried over to the N. Also, the rigid carryover of the E-H midline to the P is
    rather clumsy."
