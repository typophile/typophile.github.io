body: "Just wondering if you'd share your thoughts on the kerning of this. I feel
  like that no matter what I do to the word \"Karma\" it looks 'off'. My wife says
  I should connect or bridge the r and m, but I'm not ready to do that yet. \r\n"

  body: You have space the whole around the pair. I'd try leaving the KA pair alone
    and loosening up the rest to appear more balanced. Did you make the small caps
    a little smaller?

  body: thank you, I'll give that a shot. The small caps were not modified at all.

  body: Speaking as the new kid, this is more a question than a critique - I'm looking
    at "Karma," and noticing there's a pretty distinct difference between AR/MA and
    RM. Would you say that's good kerning? This is an area of weakness for me, and
    I seek to learn, sensei.

  body: "The aim of kerning is to create a similar area between characters, but not
    at the expense of making it difficult to read. It looks good to me.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: I don't have as much a problem with the kerning as the weight differences
    of the B and K with the other characters. They feel heavier and might be creating
    a color shift you don't like. Over all everything is looser than I would like,
    buts thats me.
