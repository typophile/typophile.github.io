  body: "I was looking for a specific font, and did not have an image handy to use
    the search feature on MyFonts. That worked very well in finding Adobe Present
    for me, but for some reason its \"fonts like this\" feature seems to go all over
    the map.\r\n\r\nI was looking for a font that looked a bit like Kingthings Petrock,
    but plainer - more like Post Roman, for example.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't even seem
    to exist; I found EF Karonlinger, Post Antiqua (and Scriptuale), Lucida Casual,
    and I even found EF Medieva... which looks like the old Magic: the Gathering font!\r\n\r\n...
    oh, and did I mention Sanvito?"

  body: To be frank, I don't think anything really resembles Papyrus that much (even
    in your list), and for good reason. In recommending <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/papyrus/">my
    alternatives</a> I attempted to match the general feeling of the face and the
    situations where it's often used.

  body: 'Incidentally, I discovered that Elsner & Flake Papyrus is slightly different
    from other versions of that typeface: the capital letters are larger, and have
    a baseline below the line. A sample of that face which I saw on a web site matched
    Ereshkigal but not Papyrus because of that.'

    they come closer than the ones suggested here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/papyrus/\r\n\r\nAnd
    I've turned up another possibility; one of the \"basic fonts\" from Scriptorum,
    Procopius, might do. (It seems to be quite similar to Post Antiqua and Scriptuale,
    though.)"

  body: Yes, in another thread I did mention Fable. Taking a closer look at it, perhaps
    Fable and Ereshkigal are the two closest alternatives; I originally ranked Fable
    fairly low due to its curved letters.

  body: To me the only resemblance between Papyrus and the typefaces you listed is
    that they're humanist. Furthermore I don't think they look much like Papyrus,
    which I consider a good thing. I quite like Caterina though.
