  body: Well, personally i don&#39;t find this to be a very exciting task, mainly
    because the brief&#39;s quoute you showed suggests me something like either wacky
    or &#34;minimalistic&#34; settings with Helvetica light punched out on spot color
    blocks, but maybe I&#39;m being a bit blind and unimaginative. <BR> <BR>I guess
    that what I mean is that  it&#39;s a good idea to avoid this classic &#34;designer
    Helvetica settings&#34;. Anyway, does Helvetica actually needs promotion? It&#39;s
    omnipresent.

    target="_blank">this thread</a> and do a search here with &#39;Helvetica&#39;
    for a lot of other comments as well. I found John Hudson&#39;s comment particularly
    interesting.
