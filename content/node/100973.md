    For, of course, obvious reasons.

    most users set the same font at different sizes for Latin and Chinese, perhaps
    that relationship needs to be adjusted?\r\n"

  body: '@jasonc  It seems to me it doesn''t make sense to use a Chinese font for
    mainly Latin text, while for Latin characters embedded in Chinese text you would
    follow the practice of the standard Chinese font makers.   Most of those that
    come with OS X seem to make the Latin caps just slightly smaller than the Chinese.'

    with a few Chinese characters might use different point sizes for the two, as
    long as you're using one font, the line spacing remains constant."

  body: "I think it\u2019s the other way around: Chinese text should be smaller than
    Latin text, especially when in print using traditional serif faces. This is because
    CJK ideographs\u2019 essential visual area fills the entire em block (when we
    CJK people read, we read the whole thing \u2013 basically the contour or the mock
    shape), while Latin\u2019s essential visual area is concentrated around the x-height.
    Another reason (Mr. David Berlow says,) is that same amount of Latin text has
    a lower grayness density than CJK text, similarly because CJK text fills the whole
    em block. \r\n\r\nThis means that when you have, say, a Mincho cross-typeset with
    a Garalde or a Venetian, the Mincho always looks bigger and should be compensated
    by a smaller point size. But again it\u2019s dependent on what typefaces you choose
    to combine. Those with a higher x-height may need less compensation.\r\n\r\nThe
    best solution is to make one truly harmonious typeface so that when one language
    is set at a certain size, the other language is already adjusted. The existing
    CJK ones are mostly mere combinations of two typefaces without changing them (i.e.
    a Mincho adhered to a Caslon, or a Gothic adhered to a Frutiger). Then the question
    comes: what kind of guidance should we follow, if \u201CCJK size equals Latin\u2019s
    x-height\u201D is too crude?"

  body: "@Grub Street:\r\nThat's an interesting perspective. It is true that the x-height
    of Latin represents the part of the character that is always present, and so in
    some sense it is comparable to the full height of a Chinese character.\r\n\r\nBut
    one only has to distinguish between 52 glyphs in the Latin alphabet - and so there's
    a lot less detail and information in a letter than in a character.\r\n\r\nSo,
    while I might agree that in a combined setting, for visual harmony, one might
    have Chinese characters at the height of, say, small capitals, if they were fully
    legible at that height, the fact that independently Latin text tends to be legible
    even at 8 points (in a typeface designed for good legibility) while CJK text needs
    at least 12 doesn't change either.\r\n\r\nSo the needs of legibility and those
    of esthetics seem to be in direct opposition here.\r\n\r\n@jasonc:\r\nIf one is
    designing a Chinese font, presumably it's going to be used primarily to print
    Chinese text. The Latin characters should be at a size that will not cause disruption
    to that text when an occasional name or phrase in a Latin-alphabet language is
    interposed. At least that's the goal existing practice is aimed at, and it seems
    reasonable to me.\r\n\r\nEnglish-language books about the Chinese language will
    sometimes happily disfigure a paragraph set in 10-point type with Chinese characters
    at 24 points or thereabouts; that's because a maximum level of legibility for
    readers with little if any familiarity with Chinese is their goal. That is an
    extreme of typographic practice for a particular situation, and is not the optimum
    for regular work either."

      CJK-Latin typesetting. See their TP Mincho: http://www.typeproject.com/font/tpmincho/en/\r\n\r\nYes,
      I admit that lowest threshold point sizes for CJK and Latin are not the same.
      Yet while (I assume) most people would agree that we should keep text legible
      before making it beautiful. While TP Mincho\u2019s \u201Ca wide range of contrast
      levels\u201D could be easily seen as pure PR done to sell an ordinary idea of
      \u201Ca wide range of interpolation,\u201D it has at least provided a possible
      way to make things beautiful (having a higher contrast ratio for Latin, overshooting
      all the Japanese characters, reducing unnecessary strokes, not adhering to a
      strict Latin tradition, &c.)"
