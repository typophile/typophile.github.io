  is by far the subject which peaks my interest the most. The textbook I read for
  school was Robert Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style, which was wonderful.
  I must have read the entire book in the first few weeks of the semester.\r\n\r\nI
  am looking at ordering either Emil Ruder's Typographie or Muller-Brockman's Grid
  Systems in Graphic Design.\r\n\r\nSo, I wanted to ask working designers which book
  they would recommend a design student read first. Also, are there any other recommended
  books?\r\n\r\nThank's for your advice!"

    body: I absolutely agree. And I've always been very fond of Ruder's book--plus
      I think it's a good compliment/contrast to Bringhurst.

  body: "I often use Muller-Brockman's book as a reference. Unsurprisingly,\r\nas
    he is essentially putting forward his manifesto, it is written quite\r\ndictatorially,
    but as long as you are aware that there are other ways \r\nof doing things, it's
    a good book to have. \r\n\r\nTo be honest I would say buy as many books as you
    can afford. Just \r\nhoover up every bit of knowledge you can find. \r\n\r\nPhil"

  body: "Sounds good! Thank you all for your input. I can't read enough about typography,
    and can't stop thinking about it either! It is unfortunate however, that quality
    books and periodicals are not more readily available in most bookstores though.
    I usually have to order most items online.\r\n\r\nJustin"

      I finally got \"Robert Brownjohn  Sex and Typography.\" A must-see!\r\n\r\nAnd
      Willi Kunz's book--I'll delve into that tomorrow and let you know.\r\n\r\nSorry,
      you've contracted the obsession. There is no cure, but a lot of good books.
      Happy reading."

    to track down past issues, and become familiar with the magazines that do, and
    when they publish. The UK magazine Computer Arts Projects just put out its type
    issue, which may still be available.\r\n"
