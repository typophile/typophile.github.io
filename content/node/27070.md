body: This ad appears in the August 2004 issue of Word magazine - published in the
  UK. I thought it might be Locator - but no. Some of the letterforms remind me of
  Emigre work - but no again. Any ideas? Thanks much!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48203.jpg"

  body: Hi Alex. I think you nailed it. The only thing I can&#39;t tell from the link
    you gave is whether or not the &#34;corners&#34; of the letters are rounded. They
    are rounded just slightly - it&#39;s very cool. If this isn&#39;t it, it could
    be a customized version of it. Thanks!

  body: Alex. It&#39;s definitely Houschka. I was looking for a distributor in the
    US - Veer is now distributing the G-Type foundry &#40;Nick Cooke&#41; who designed
    this face. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: Damn. That is a great grab by Veer. <BR> <BR>I can also confirm it is Houschka
    because I bought it  <BR>along with <a href="http://stewf.com/" target="_blank">Geetype</a>
