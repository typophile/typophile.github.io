body: "After 11 years, my first text typeface has finally been released into the wild.
  FF Spinoza was designed to be an elegant workhorse: crisp, sturdy, economical, and
  versatile. A classic and highly readable Antiqua, it has compact proportions and
  a generous, though not exaggerated, x-height and aperture. Robust thin strokes and
  pronounced serifs and terminals make it suitable for setting in small sizes under
  challenging conditions, both in print and on the Web. Abruptly tapered junctures
  keep characters sharply defined and, in the heavier weights, create enlivening light
  traps. Its curves are subtly faceted, with extra corners and unexpectedly straight
  edges that add interest in display sizes and energy in text sizes. FF Spinoza includes
  a comprehensive set of diacritics providing support for more than 70 languages,
  from Afrikaans to Zulu. The Pro version supports more than 130 languages.\r\n<br

  body: "Many thanks for the generous words, everyone.\r\n\r\n<em>Trevor:</em> You're
    putting me in very exalted company.  I think Clifford and Renard are two of the
    most beautiful book faces of the last 20 years.\r\n\r\n<em>Nick Shinn:</em> Coming
    from you, that's a very great compliment.\r\n\r\n<em>Nick & riccard0:</em> Georg
    Trump also used the reversed-stress z for his Trump Mediaval, which was probably
    the biggest influence on Spinoza.  For what it's worth, Andreas Frohloff at FontFont
    suggested a more conventional z, and actually drew quite a beautiful one, but
    agreed to use my orginal glyph when I told him it was important to me.  I owe
    Andreas a lot; he put a great deal of work and care into Spinoza, as did Ugla
    Marekowa, Ivo Gabrowitsch, Frank Grie\xDFhammer, and Christoph Koeberlin at FSI."

    was kind of poking fun at you for taking so long, but I certainly appreciate that
    it can take ages to produce such a thorough, large work. And large seems to be
    a requirement of a text type these days. Of course, it was ever thus, but large
    today is way larger than in the past."

  body: "It takes all kinds.\r\nI have just about finished teaching a semester of
    type design to a class of third year design students, many of whom have had great
    difficulty in being able to concentrate sufficiently on the work, having to check
    Facebook every few minutes. However, one student told me she had really enjoyed
    the course, finding it very pleasant and relaxing. I live for such moments."

  body: "<em>Nick:</em> I kind of got that you were teasing me a bit for being slow,
    but I'm hoping you also meant it when you called the typeface good. Since I haven't
    had any training in type design, I'd guess I spent about nine of those 11 years
    bumbling around in circles, trying to teach myself the basics. The design itself
    probably took about two of those years, once I'd run out of ways to do things
    wrong. Just trying to design a companion italic with near-horizontal departures,
    to match the roman's horizontal departures, took a lot more time than I want to
    think about.  Once I threw that out and started from scratch with an italic that
    felt right instead of one that matched my preconceived notions, the actual italic
    only took a few months. But I'm hoping the next typeface won't take a decade.\r\n\r\n<em>Andreas:</em>
    Thanks! I did have a good time. And I'd love to add Greek language support, and
    Cyrillic, too.  But first I've got to sell a few downloads, just so I know this
    isn't just a really time-consuming hobby..."

  body: "Thanks again, everyone.  \r\n\r\nI'd love to do a sans companion, Matheus,
    and have been noodling with some sketches.  And I'm a great admirer of Scala;
    it was definitely one of the faces on my mind when I was designing Spinoza.\r\n\r\nThe
    little corner on the spine of the S is something I'd wanted to do for a long time,
    Hrant.  \r\n\r\nEliason, I don't remember any more where I got the idea of the
    reversed stress oldstyle zero, but probably from Stempel Garamond, another inspiration.
    \ The italic tittles came out of a conversation with Andreas at FSI.  My original
    tittle was a three-cornered version of the four-cornered tittles in the roman.
    \ Andreas at first recommended making the itals more genuinely calligraphic\u2014more
    like a Minion Italic\u2014and suggested a tittle that could be drawn with an edged
    pen.  When I said I didn't want a purely calligraphic ital, he suggested I go
    in the other direction, and make the tittle very clearly non-calligraphic.  So
    I came up with this, with the hard straight leading edge.  I like it better than
    my first idea."
