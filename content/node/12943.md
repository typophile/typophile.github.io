  Features</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Preface</strong>\r\n[[OpenType]] is a powerful
  new font format that gives users a much broader range of typographic and linguistic
  control than has previously been available with a single digital font. More and
  more type [[foundries]] offer OpenType (OT) fonts these days and one can expect
  the average user to become more aware of the benefits of OT fonts as more applications
  take advantage of their capabilites in the future.\r\n\r\n<strong>Getting Started</strong>\r\nOnce
  you've decided you want to develop OT fonts, you must decide what software you want
  to use to accomplish this task. Your choices include:<ul><li><strong>FontLab's OpenType
  Tools</strong> OpenType programming tools built into the popular font creation software
  [[FontLab]].</li>\r\n<li><strong>Microsoft's Visual OpenType Layout Tool</strong>
  ([[VOLT]]) A free tool available to add OpenType layout tables to TrueType fonts.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Adobe
  Font Development Kit for OpenType</strong> ([[AFDKO]]) A set of opensourse tools
  available to add OpenType layout tables to PostScript fonts.</li></ul>\r\nEach of
  these methods has its own set of advantages and drawbacks, for example: FontLab
  makes it easy to preview OT features, but it does not yet support complicated lookups
  such as one-to-many replacements. Adobe's FDK and Microsoft's VOLT may give access
  to more advanced features but do so at the expense of ease of use. Additionally
  these programs can only export one [[flavor]] of OT font (PostScript and TrueType
  respectively). The next few sections will be dedicated to the basics of using each
  of these methods.\r\n\r\n<strong>Some pointers for learning the &#8220;OpenType
  language&#8221;</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your starter may be <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.net/Typographic-Resources/Font-Typography-Books/Learn-FontLab-Fast/\">Leslie
  Cabarga&#8217;s &#8220;Learn FontLab Fast&#8221;</a> book.</li>\r\n<li>Secondly,
  there is a chapter <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.net/font-editor/fontlab-studio/download-fontlab-studio/\">FontLab
  Studio manual</a>.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>John Hudson&#8217;s article <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/Glyph%20Processing/intro.mspx\">Windows
  Glyphs Processing</a> provides a good overview of the OpenType technology.</li>\r\n<li><a
  href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support/\">Typotheque</a>
  provides a useful reference of Layout features used by different applications.</li>\r\n<li>The
  <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/ttoreg.htm\">OpenType tag registry</a>
  provides an overview of all registered OpenType Layout features.</li>\r\n<li>Microsoft
  provides an overview of the system support for OpenType Layout features <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/intro.mspx\">for
  Latin, Cyrillic, Greek and other &#8220;standard&#8221; writing systems</a>.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><a
  href=\"http://kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm\">Karsten Luecke</a> collected his various
  useful OpenType production notes</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Adobe published the <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/adamtwar/opentypedev/\">AFDKO
  source code for the Bickham Script Pro and Minion Pro</a> OpenType fonts they published.</li>\r\n<li>Adobe&#8217;s
  <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/slye_lisbon-05.pdf\">Christopher
  Slye</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/atypi_Adventures_in_class_kerning.pdf\">Miguel
  Sousa</a> published useful slides.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>There are numerous <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Atypophile.com+feature+sub\">threads
  on Typophile</a> that discuss specific quesions and issues.</li>\r\n<li>Finally,
  the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html\">AFDKO
  feature file syntax</a> is the ultimate reference for the language.</li>\r\n<li>The
  <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/\">OpenType font format specification</a>
  is an important reference.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>General Practices</strong>\r\nThe
  following advice is applicable no matter which method you choose to add OT features
  to your font. When planning which features to incorporate into your OpenType font,
  it's good to keep in mind what features are currently supported, because although
  dozens of features have been defined in the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featurelist.htm\">OpenType
  layout tag registry</a>, only a handful are currently supported by currently available
  applications. For example, although the \"rand\" feature has been defined to randomize
  characters from a set of alternate glyphs, there are currently no programs that
  offer support for this feature. Including an unsupported feature may give the font
  extended functionality in the future, but at the present time font users would have
  no way to access such a feature. For an up-to-date listing of which features are
  supported by what software, see [[Typotheque]]'s <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support/\">OpenType
  Feature Support in Applications</a> page.\r\n\r\n<strong>FontLab</strong>\r\nFontLab
  incorporates Adobe's feature definition code for OpenType programing within its
  font editor. FontLab's <a href=\"http://www.font.to/downloads/FL46WinDoc.pdf\">user's
  manual</a> gives a crash course on how to write lookups using this syntax. For a
  more detailed overview, see <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html\">Adobe's
  OpenType Feature File Specification</a>. Once you've read through this, it's a good
  idea to look at some feature files by some professional foundries. Adobe has made
  a couple of OT feature files available so that OpenType developers can see how to
  build complete sets of OT features. Currently, Adobe has released the feature files
  for <a href=\"http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?50@893.Qb7beqhqCtw.2@.3bb58628\">Minion
  Pro</a> and for <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/8602\">Bickham Script Pro</a>.
  FontLab also offers a Free Font Pro with an extended character set and opentype
  layout tags that developers can open up and experiment with to get a feel for how
  different features work. Most OT features for the English language are made up of
  simple subtitutions (GSUB lookups). These types of lookups are simple to write.
  Using only simple substitution rules, one can sucessfully build simple features
  for [[ligature|ligatures]], [[text figures]] (oldstyle figures), stylistic alternates,
  &c.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/32455\">OpenType
