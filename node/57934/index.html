My freeware has been updated to allow "editing of the document". I will allow all web embedding for the freeware. Should I go further with "installable mode"? Would that be necessary?

Especially at the differentiation between sIFR, Cufón and @font-face given the differentiation in technologies between them.

We have always allowed PDF embedding for workflow and internal uses and do also allow secure web embedding in PDF and flash, which covers sIFR and i think Cufon too.

We do NOT allow font-linking, in sense that the font files reside on a server. If i understand Font-face correctly, then this is not covered.

We're collaborating with a web company on a font-license scheme which will allow fonts to be linked to a website easily and painlessly. It should be launched very soon.</div>

The PDF isn't public in the sense that it's included in a product we sell to the general public, or posted on a web site, but it's hard to see it as workflow or internal distribution.

Do these threads intend to produce something different than Ralf's wiki page?
http://www.webfonts.info/wiki/index.php?title=Fonts_available_for_%40font-face_embedding

... if not, and for the sake of community participation, perhaps that could be used as a starting point for a Typophile wiki page.

If the only difference between the list we're trying to assemble here and the list Ralf has begun is that we're attempting to cross-index licensing nuances with web technologies like sIFR, Cufón, and FLIR, I don't think it's worth the time. @font-face is ready to go. Focus on that list.</div>

Joe, I couldn't agree more. I think graphic designers and type designers need to become best friends. Together both groups can go much further as allies than as adversaries.

If it's on a web page viewable on my machine then I already have the files on my machine in some digital form already. 

As much as I'd like to see a license that merely stated 'you can use this in digital file' or 'you can't use this in digital files', unfortunately, it seems like we need to create a matrix to fully compare all these options:

 - PDF
 - Cufon 
 - @font-face
 - Flash
 - others? (Silverlight? SVG? Etc...)

And then those that refer to 'secure' of any of the above would need a superscripted reference with small print defining what they actually mean by the term.

PDF Embedding 
- Basics
-- No PDF embedding allowed
-- Print & preview only
-- Editable okay (forms)
-- Must subset
-- Must encrypt
-- Must password protect 
- Distribution of PDF including the fonts
-- Workflow only distribtion (to service providers like printers, proofreaders)
-- Limited organizational distribution (within organizations)
-- Limited geographical distribution (within a specific worksite)
-- Extended distribution (eg. distribution via email)
-- Unlimited distribution (ie posted to Web)
-- Commercial distribution (ebooks)

For each of these the answer for any given vendor will be yes/no/requires extended license

		<div class="commentbody">As far as I understand, this is the base differences between the different methods of using fonts on the web (besides PDF)

Providing some protection against download is the big advantage of flash (and probably silverlight) implementations of fonts for web usage. Cufon re-encodes the file and *can* secure it to a domain, but enterprising folk could reverse engineer it to get the font back much easier than they could with flash. fLIR or facelift, uses PHP to create an image with the font in it, but that font has to exist somewhere on the server and could also be reverse-engineered. @font-face, in its current form, provides little to no protection.

Font foundry "type tester" applications would be one area most of us are familiar with, another might be Google maps - text is rendered on the server and the resulting bitmap is sent to the browser.

It's probably not a good idea to maintain two separate lists, though if you want to use the content of the webfonts.info page, it is all licensed under Creative Commons. So a proper attribution of the source would suffice. 

I would be happy to help with that, but as far I understand this thread people here are more asking about an EULA matrix of possible web uses. But as Simon already pointed out with his PDF example, every of those technologies has plenty of options and a simple list or matrix would probably not work. 


<cite>We’re collaborating with a web company on a font-license scheme which will allow fonts to be linked to a website easily and painlessly.</cite>

Assuming you mean sIFR, I would not say it is "secure." It uses Flash, which has a public spec, and the files are accessible, so... the fonts could be pulled out of the SWF files. I would however say that sIFR and Flash are "about as secure as PDF." Which may be good enough for most font vendors.

Almost anything short of posting the font to the web in raw form can be negotiated, if the price is right. 

If money is no object, or you're willing to take ethically dubious short-cuts, then "custom" will be the alternative if you want to raw link.

Heck, if the price is right, posting the font to the web in raw form would be fine too. Hence my position on all this: I care less about the format and the security model per se than about the viability of the associated business model. Which is why most discussion on web fonts seems to me to come from the wrong end: it's looking for a magical technical solution that will satisfy current business models, rather than asking what kind of business models will be possible with the technical developments before us.

And 'the ugliness of the Web' is pretty insignificant aspect of what we're looking at, which is font linking and embedding in live electronic documents, online applications, cloud computing, etc. I suspect that foundries, taking an ad hoc approach to online technologies -- PDF? Okay. Flash? Okay. sIFR? Okay. -- are going to find it harder and harder to establish grounds on which to say 'Not okay!' to future developments.</div>

The same price as any other license. My plan to offer single-server embedding licenses at a low price ran into a wall: MyFonts system just isn’t designed for those licensing options. I was going to set up my own web store to handle the sales, but than I ran into a wall of incorporation and sales tax laws. I’m not making enough money to justify hiring a lawyer and an accountant and setting up a new online store, so I decided to rewrite the workstation license to allow web embedding.</div>

Stuff like @font-face won't work unless foundries let go of some fears.

Permit me to give you guys a gentle ribbing. Right now font licensing so complex that licensors can't just focus on the right typographic solution, they have to navigate cumbersome EULAs and nuanced embedding permissions. (Foundry A has these flavors, Foundry B has these other flavors.)

Consider how the iTunes music store made it easier to <del>buy</del> license music than to download it illicitly. Seriously. Win, win. Yes, music is still downloaded and shared illicitly, but the default is that it's just easier to buy it. This is an analogy, and not a perfect one, but I think it has merit. Companies that make it easy (and have quality type) will win -- that's why I was motivated to start the list. 

The complexity is the foundries' problem to solve, not your customers'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Joe - Your requests are reasonable, and I know there are many foundries who want to move forward with some sort of web licensing. But in comparing fonts to music remember that iTunes was created and negotiated by a multi-million dollar company with a device and incentive to make the music store happen. There is no single company or cooperative organization in the font world to compare with that. Font manufacturers and their resources are small. The technology and systems for web fonts and licensing will simply come slower.</div>

Re-reading my comment about whining sounds harsh. I'm sorry if I came across as an antagonist.

I've been sitting on a draft of some larger thoughts on this topic, blogged on my Typophile blog that were spurred when I saw the beautiful New York Times Reader app. It's web content, but it avoids a lot of these embedding/licensing issues because a) it's a desktop app and b) it's their font to do whatever they want.

		<div class="commentbody">We will be allowing Web Linking (@font-face) soon! Cufon is against the terms of our existing EULA and will remain so. Use on our fonts by unlicensed users is prohibited by trademark and copyright laws and we will enforce them where possible. SiFR will be part of our permissions. Flash is not a separate thing.  

Sii: "Any embedding permissions chart will be pretty massive..."
How big is your Permissions Table, fella? We have even wider needs than MS, as you can imagine, so it's complex, but its doable...and we don't think anyone cares how big it is. All permissions being covered by a single Embedding & Linking User Addendum in our license is a problem to, but doable. I bet our Addendum's longer than yours, because again, we don't care how long it is. 

Joe: "...the beautiful New York Times Reader...It’s web content..."
It works, I believe, because it is not web content, if I take your context correctly. 

John: "PDF? Okay. Flash? Okay. sIFR? Okay"
If: a. it embeds, truly, there is no font file, just a file, b. it never unpacks a font 'in front of' the user, nor leaves fonts around, c. it subsets by document requirement, d. it leaves most of the intellectual property where the file was authored, 

Then: Okay.  (Cufon aims to short-circuit this to some extent. As I study it, it gets uglier.)

If: a. it can't agree what format it wants, b. it can't agree how it's going to install/manage these formats, c. it can't agree on how to interpret, scale or render, d. it can't agree on how to move towards agreement, 

Then: well, okay. We, the font industry will let go of our fears, (whatever that means). 

John: "Asking what kind of business models will be possible with the technical developments before us."

This is exactly what we've done/been doing @FB. But...we had to go looking for a "magical technical solution" because of the one presented to us when @font-face's "magical recommendations" started being followed. We've chosen an optional OT table to spare you-all the drama of revising a required OT table.

Though music is a fine analogy to fonts when music is distributed by the instrument (in which case there is a totally different use to the software), I'd suggest maybe reading up on Drivers Licenses. They don't actually "do anything" either, just like our Permissions Table and our Embedding & Linking User's Addendum.

<strong>The web ≠ The browser</strong>

I say it's "web content" because it's content served from a web server, viewed by a client application on a remote machine. The NYTimes Reader that is a Flash application built on Adobe's AIR platform and the fonts are embedded in the app, not installed on the desktop or the OS level. But I wouldn't limit web content to mean stuff that's viewed in a browser.

The Xbox, iPhone,  PS3, Wii, Chumby, G1, Blackberry, etc, etc, are all delivering web content to people, sometimes in browsers on those devices, but most often not delivered through a browser. Where will the fonts live? Will they live at the OS level of the device or will they live in the apps or widgets users download? That's the horizon to solve for.

iPhone apps and Safari for iPhone both deliver web-based content. The former uses fonts embedded in the apps, the latter requires fonts installed at the iPhone OS level.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have just updated the <a href="http://www.fonthead.com/license">Fonthead license agreement</a> with fairly loose licensing. My thanks the James Puckett and his EULA. I see you took the MyFonts EULA and modified. I essentially just did the same thing and tried to delineate between PDF, web and application embedding. Here's the gist of it:

4a. Adobe Portable Document Format ("PDF") Embedding
You may embed the licensed fonts into any read-only PDF you send to third parties. Such documents may only be viewable and printable (but not editable) by the recipients.

4b. HTML Web Page Embedding 
You may embed the licensed fonts into HTML web pages for the purpose of typesetting the page using any of the following methods and technologies: @font-face Cascading Style Sheet ("CSS") rules, Adobe Flash files, Microsoft Silverlight files, sIFR, fLIR, Cufón and Typeface.js. Other technologies not listed here that would allow a designer to typeset web pages using the licensed fonts are allowed providing that the licensed fonts themselves are not obviously downloadable and reasonably hidden from average users

4c. Application and Game Embedding
You may embed the licensed fonts into any application or game displayed through a computing device with the following caveat:
If the application allows end-users to render custom typographic design or content using the licensed fonts for the purpose of creating a customized design, you must purchase a 15-device license. For example, your website allows visitors to typeset a t-shirt or bumper stickers or promotional items using the licensed fonts.

------

I look at my license more in the sense that it is for conscientious people who desire to do what is right. I'd rather err on giving too much away. My fonts are pretty low-grade compared to likes of many of you, so I guess I have less to protect. I see less restrictive licensing as a way to build more business as it leaves a wider door open.

My 2 cents. Whatever they are worth!

As John says, a clear statement of what is meant by ‘web embedding’ is critical. 

>What is permitted by the permit?

This is exactly (though not only) what the permission table is being designed to do. 

>Tal Leming’s suggestion: Tal says in his post, "One simple change to the OpenType spec, that's all there is too it!" 
Tal's proposal  calls for a rev to all fonts (agreed!), all browsers (a year at least?), the OT spec (a year?), and the OFF spec (2 years from now?)... Even if it all happened this summer, it is hardy 'a' simple change. 

Our proposal is simpler, forward thinking and self-rev-contained within our industry.

The first part is impossible, I think. . . @font-face means : the font file is linked by url in the CSS, the url says where the font is, the font is downloaded and installed from the server to the user's cpu. @font-face demands that the files at the end of the url <em>be downloadable</em>. There is no embedding of the font 'in' anything.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I am actually really bothered by the term "embedding" as it is a typically used for this topic.

When font data is included in a file -- as it is often in a PDF or Flash file -- it is embedded. The font data moves with the file, is copied, transmitted etc.

When a font reference is made in a document, as with @font-face, there is no embedding (IMO). An HTML document (for example) has an instruction that says, "Go get the font from this place". The font is retrieved and used as needed. The font might end up stored or cached as a result of this, but that isn't the essence of the process.

Using this word, "embedding," is, I think, causing some confusion about different methods, and conflates PDF or Flash font embedding with web font serving, which to me are completely different. Many foundries don't mind font data being <em>embedded</em> in a PDF, because it is (usually) deconstructed, obscured, and somewhat protected, but having a font file sitting exposed on a server for all to take is alarming. From the perspective of a EULA, it's probably going to be treated quite separately.

Tal observes that most designers see font embedding bits as applying to PDFs, which sounds right to me -- but he misses the point that the reason they don't think the embedding bit applies to "web embedding" is because, I think, "web embedding" really isn't embedding.

What we are really talking about is font <em>serving</em> (or is there a better word?). Foundries want a way to serve fonts to web browsers and other clients which doesn't make those fonts easy to steal.

I understand it's just a word, and many people understand the difference, but I think it's confusing for other people and might be corrupting the discussion to some degree.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christopher, I agree wholeheartedly: the terminology is a real problem. These comments from Bert Bos (W3C) to the ATypI list may be helpful:

<em>A characteristic of embedding is that the font is as much associated 
with the document as the document with the font: when you have one, you 
automatically have the other, because they are just one file.

A characteristic of linking as we use it on the Web is that it is 
unidirectional: the document links to the style sheet, but given just 
the style sheet you don't know what document uses it.

That is a very powerful feature: you can use the style sheet from 
anywhere on the Web and in as many documents as you like, without ever 
having to change or copy the style sheet. But such unlimited re-use is 
probably not compatible with the typical licenses for embeddable fonts.

So we either need to change the licensing model for fonts (not something 
I expect to happen soon), invent a way to put a font file inside an 
HTML file (not easy), or create bi-directional links. In my mind, the 
latter is as good as putting the document and the font in one file; 
better in some respects, because for many uses of the document you 
don't need the font and thus have a smaller file to deal with.</em></div>

"Foundries want a way to serve fonts to web browsers and other clients which doesn’t make those fonts easy to steal."

And therein lies the potential problem. If I understand dberlow's proposal (and other similar ones) there will end up being a mild form of DRM in the font that says "this particular font file can or can't be 'served' via an @font-face request". If that is correct (dberlow or anyone else please correct me if I am wrong) we are then assuming that:
 
 - all HTML rendering software is going to be updated to obey said bit flag
 - no one will write a browser add-on to circumvent said bit flag
 - no one will create yet-another-open source browser that ignores it
 - and I'm sure a few other gotchas I haven't thought of.

Seems like that's a lot to assume. </div>

I never stated your first hyphen, your second depends on the first, the third is related to the first wrong assumption as well and that part of your post makes me curious as to exactly what you are reading and who wrote it. ;)

The Permissions table proposal is designed as an Optional OT table, to state the permissions allowed between the owner of the font and the licensee. There is no DRM demanded or assumed and no other applications will be required to rev. for it to accomplish it's intended task. 

The one assumption the strategy of the permission table makes is that <strong>eventually</strong> all W3C compliant UAs share <em>one</em> @fontface font format in common. That is not the current situation, and probably a good way for the W3C to move this along if they can. 

Bert via John><em>So we either need to change the licensing model for fonts</em>
This year we plan to </em>add to</em> our licensing model. But until every single solitary printer in the world, which needs a font it doesn't have in memory, is online to the web, we can't just <em>change</em> the licensing model for fonts. :)

><em>invent a way to put a font file inside an HTML file (not easy),</em>
Is anyone even working on it?

><em>or create bi-directional links.</em>
This will be permitted in said table. Assuming this means the table can contain both the url of the font's server one is permitted to link to, and the url(s) at which the font is allowed to be displayed.

We also believe in permitting uni-directional links for the sake of some client types.

As it is now, a browser request a URL from a server, which typically serves back an HTML document. That document contains a list of requested assets. @font-face would be one of those. It then goes an requests it from the server hosting the asset. Where does the permissions table come into play in this scenario? What is 'pinging' that table? The browser? The server hosting the web site and font? That's the part of the proposal I'm not understanding.

Depends on what services the pinger wants to provide. There are no required pings.

What would you like to ping it?

@font-face directly from the type foundry’s own server is intended as one of our least expensive licenses. For a previously licensed font for print or pdf embedding or for a font new to the user, the simplest user can go to a web site, pay a small fee, and get a url to link their css to. The font, in the permissions table, will record the domain to which the font becomes an asset, and the url from which the font is serve-able.

		<div class="commentbody">“<cite>invent a way to put a font file inside an HTML file (not easy)</cite>”

It’s a nice and officialy possible idea. You can “embed” files in HTML with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data:_URI_scheme">data URI scheme</a>. Actually, it’s better to embed them in CSS file, because of chaching and redudancy. Here is an example of embeded image in CSS: <a href="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/inline-images/">link</a>.

In theory, it should work for font files too (browser support?). So, CSS would look like this:

<code>@font-face {
&#09;font-family: Font_name;
&#09;src: url(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAA<em>/*font data…*/</em>OALMAAOazToeHh0tLS/7LZv/0jvb29t/f3/);
}</code>

Furthermore, if combined with <code>unicode-range</code>, font could be scattered in multiple parts in CSS file, making it unpossible to manually get the whole font file. Example:

<code>@font-face {
&#09;font-family: Font_name;
&#09;src: url(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAA<em>/*font data…*/</em>OALMAAOazToeHh0tLS/7LZv/0jvb29t/f3/);
&#09;unicode-range: U+00<strong>0?</strong>;
}</code>

<code>@font-face {
&#09;font-family: Font_name;
&#09;src: url(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAA<em>/*font data…*/</em>OALMAAOazToeHh0tLS/7LZv/0jvb29t/f3/);
&#09;unicode-range: U+00<strong>1?</strong>;
&#09;/* etc … unicode ranges for all characters */
}</code>

Good side of this is a mild DRM protection. It’s something like fonts in Flash, but just a <em>little</em> less protected.

Bad side is additional work for web designer. In best case, an program has to be used with input of font file and an output of text (wich is then copied in CSS file). There is also a little more time to download the whole thing and just a little more time for browser to compute everything.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One thing to keep in mind when considering different forms of font obfuscation is that the 'name' table of a downloaded font is effectively ignored when loaded via an @font-face rule, since a downloadable font needs to be private to the document in which it's used.  The font-family descriptor name in the @font-face definition is the name used to group together a set of faces.  So for web-only fonts, it would work just fine to ship fonts with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID">GUID's</a> for the family name of each face along with sample @font-face definitions for inclusion in stylesheets.  Anyone attempting to use the font as a desktop font will see very funky entries in their font menu.

@miha: Data URI's work fine but they're not terribly efficient, the font will always be downloaded whether it's used or not.  If you're setting up a site-wide stylesheet that won't scale very well.  Using unicode-range per-glyph will break kerning.

Monotype Imaging has three types of commercial use categories: Web site content, commercial product and commercial use. These use categories cover the use of fonts in EOT as well as other font formats. Business models are being finalized to support each category.
Commercial Web site content: Commercial Web site content use covers the use of EOT fonts on the Web site of a commercial enterprise. The Web site cannot charge for the content that is displayed in the EOT font or allow the user to interact with the font (content displayed in the EOT font can be read and printed only) to fit into the commercial Web site use category.
Commercial Product: Commercial product use covers the inclusion of fonts in any format in a product that is sold. Games and e-books that ship with a font are examples of commercial product use. Commercial product use also covers the display of content on a Web site that a user must pay for in order to access. An example is an online magazine such as ConsumerReports.org.
Commercial Use: The commercial use category covers scenarios where users can interact with fonts that are embedded within a document or application that is stored on a server. This category includes companies selling products that are created with hosted fonts such as a Web site that allows users to interact with a font to create a custom greeting card. It also includes application service provider (ASP) and software as a service (SAAS) companies such as Web sites that allows users to interact with fonts to create a document that can be shared.

Usually when one or more big players in an industry do the same thing at the same time, it indicates a shift and FF / Safari may end up supporting EOT simply because the big players are pushing for it.

It depends on the users! The Adobe EULA also allows EOT linking, but as far as I know, no webdesigner was ever interested in such an IE-only solution. So I don't think the new Monotype EULA will change anything. I guess they wanted to do something about webfonts, but didn't dare to go all the way. (Which is understandably of course)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David,

Direct linking of fonts to web pages must happen. Period.
The need has now become pressing.
And it will happen whether anyone in the font industry likes it or not. (This is just a statement. I'm not an advocate one way or the other.)
However, it is going to take years for it to unfold and there is time to influence its direction to your benefit.

I read opinions about font-linking all the time on forums and come away almost always shaking my head at the extent to which the cart is being put before the horse.

Here's one example of what I mean:

Let's, for arguments sake, assume The Font Bureau offers a completely open license for font Caslon FB with regards to web use. If you buy it, you can use it without restriction.
A lot of freedom for the money right? Well, right now, as a web developer, I would have to pass on the offer.
I would have to pass unless you were willing to refund my money if Caslon FB turned out to be unusable for the design purpose to which I want to put it. (Which it probably will be.)
The reason is this: Bitmap representations of fonts are horribly inaccurate when it comes to assessing how the font will actually look when used to present normal HTML text within the browser. In assessing how the font will look at different point sizes, it is absoutely useless.
A specimen pdf does me absolutely no good in assessing, either.
Plus, your web site only offers sample bitmaps in two sizes, 24pt and 36pt which, at best, might give me an idea of how the font would look if I were to use it for unusually large headlines and unusually large headlines alone.
In other words, your sales presentation is totally geared to print.
I have absolutely no way to assess your product for the purpose of web design.

So, you can amend your licenses any which way you want and you still can't get me as a customer. Not because I'm not interested, but because I won't buy a pig in a poke.
(Provided they still keep pigs in pokes. If not, substitute another analogy.)

Jokes aside, are you getting what I'm telling you?
Potential customers, quite willing to pay, will be driven to get samples of your fonts on the darknet just in order to test them. Just to see if they work onscreen.

		<div class="commentbody">I hope some clarifications will help make things clear:

Non-commercial vs. commercial use.
As Allan Haley already explained, Monotype, Linotype and ITC support both commercial and non-commercial uses. Web font embedding for non-commercial use comes for free (one just need to buy a font); commercial use will require additional license and fee. The vast majority of the websites (such as individual blogs, schools, churches, etc.) are non-commercial, and using fonts on these websites will not require any additional costs. The commercial use is mentioned in the press release, but an emphasis was made on free license for non-commercial use.

EOT adoption
I believe that EOT as a technical solution is an good technology for web font embedding; it is the only technology available today that provides reasonable level of IP protection for font vendors and is supported by 3/4 of all browsers (IE) in use today. This is why new EULA allows EOT font linking. 
EOT hasn't been widely adopted because until recently there was no public specification that would allow to implement it. The reasons that some browser vendors are reluctant to support EOT today are mostly non-technical and, among others, are related to technology IPR licensing. Monotype wants to see high quality typography and fonts on the web and we <em> did </em> go all the way - we joined the W3C, paid our dues (literally) and are dedicated to work with all browser and font vendors to come up with the technical and IPR licensing solution for web font linking that will be widely adopted. I do not support raw font embedding, in my opinion it has drawbacks beyond IP protection, which became evident for early adopters (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009May/0036.html).
A good technical solution (and not just any solution) that is universally supported by all browsers will benefit everybody - web designers, font vendors and millions of websites and their visitors. Earlier in this thread, iTunes was brought up as an example of a successful business model but it is based on sophisticated technology that employs a strong DRM protection. EOT is not DRM despite what some people want you to believe, but it does have sufficient technical barriers in place that prevent "drive-by" access to unlicensed font resources, provide reasonable protection of font vendors' IP and optimize font data for web use, especially on slow connections. Monotype is eager to work with all browser vendors to come up with a good solution (and I believe it will happen soon). We are reluctant to support a raw font solution that was proposed with no consideration for font vendors (http://news.cnet.com/Microsofts-forgotten-monopoly/2010-1032_3-6085417.html) and doesn’t satisfy the needs of many web designers and users (http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/11/web_user_survey_results.html).

That is why the combination of Permissions and Recommendations in a single table is our starting solution. Without it, we will not be motivated/rewarded to make fonts that look good at all sizes and make good typography possible in all uses.

Despite putting this on the agenda at both events year after year (starting at TypeCon Boston), and bringing the W3C, Opera, Adobe, Apple, Roger Black and other notable players to the table to discuss the issue, no one seems very interested in Web fonts. If you want to talk about it at ATypI or TypeCon I'm sure the organizers would love to hear from you. </div>

Yeah, I do. And I'm not asking for that. I'm not saying you should be held to an impossible standard.  Let me narrow it down: I'm looking for a way to see, before I buy, how a font renders in a browser as HTML text on a typical LCD screen at the sizes that matter most in web design. Those sizes being, roughly, in CSS values: 10px to 36px or the equivalent point sizes of 7pt to 27pt. I don't think that's too much to ask, is it? I mean, just let me see how it renders in my browser under normal circumstances.
Off the top of my head, you can give me that in any one of three ways:
1) Show me a specimen page using EOT - as Vlad points out, IE still has 70% of the market. It's available on every Windows machine. No web designer worth their salt - even if they are Mac users - doesn't keep a Windows machine handy for testing.
2) If you don't want to keep it IE specific, for Safari, etc... you can link a narrowly subsetted and specially named TTF/OTF file to the specimen page. That would be enough for me.
3) Lastly, a specimen page consisting of a screen grab from an LCD screen saved as a .bmp file is quick and easy to create.(With the <a href="http://billhillsblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/confusion-over-screen-resolution-causes.html">screen resolution properly set to match the native resolution of the screen</a>) It's not as convincing and authoritative as an actual linked font file, but better than nothing. Providing both would be wise.

Unfortunately, when this is done and the bitmap anti-aliased mask is peeled away, the vast majority of fonts that look fine in print, or even an E-Paper screen, look like sh-t in a browser under usual circumstances. (And this will almost always be true when they are compared to the Microsoft Cleartype fonts, which seem to be the gold standard at this point.)
But I'm entitled to know all this before I buy.
And once the truth is apparent, we can move on to address the reasons why and improve the situation. You want money to do the additional hinting? I, for one, don't mind paying you for that.

>"(EOT) is the only technology available today that provides reasonable level of IP protection for font vendors and is supported by 3/4 of all browsers (IE) in use today."

This is a fact. If web developers don't want to wait another 10-15 years for font-linking, EOT has to be accepted and embraced. It is, as they say in military terms, "a fact on the ground."
If the W3C comes along with something similar down the road, fine. Then add support for that format, as well. But today, this is what we have to work with.

<em>Really!? Then start at the beginning, not in the middle and explain how your plan will help see high quality typography and fonts on the web.</em>

I hope you did read the rest of my original post. Monotype started by joining W3C and donating our IP and technology for free (http://www.w3.org/Submission/2008/01/). 
The fact that some browser vendors decided to stick it to Microsoft (http://www.w3.org/Fonts/Misc/minutes-2008-10#summary) and throw EOT proposal and font vendors under a bus isn't a good enough reason for me to go along and agree to support raw font linking - like I mentioned in the previous post this is not a good solution for the web for a number of reasons, which has already become evident for early adopters. 

Successful web font solution needs the following technical components in place:
- it must allow direct font linking using @font-face and at the same time prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests;
- it should protect font vendors IP (and, at the same time, protect web designers who licensed that IP from inadvertently violating their licenses);
- it should deliver compressed font data to minimize bandwidth consumption, speed up page download and improve user experience at the same time and, ideally,
- it should allow font data be streamed so that a browser can start processing the page layout without waiting for a complete font download.

Raw font solution doesn't go beyond direct font linking, EOT successfully addresses first three points, and the very nature of the MicroType Express compression (separating font data into different functional blocks) is an ideal fit for implementing font streaming. Work in W3C is not over - it's in the very beginning(see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009May/0092.html), and developing a new web font solution in W3C will take time - but it's not completely out of the question. At the risk of repeating myself, I am reluctant to support raw font embedding but I am perfectly willing to spend time and efforts to develop a good web font solution for the benefit of all parties involved.

However, your skepticism in the outcome of such initiative and your willingness to go along and allow your fonts be used in raw format "as is" only hampering these efforts and delaying the creation of the new W3C web font solution that will be universally supported by all browser vendors. I would like to respectfully ask you to reconsider your position.

With kind regards

...this is, with all due respect, an incorrect statement about my position. No 'as is' works for me or my clients as I have said many times. 

In supporting our position, I've said EOT can easily be one of the formats approved for conversion to in our table, in our fonts.

I've been following the @font-face issue for a really long time now. It was clear to me from the beginning that the legal issues were at the heart of the thing even though those issues were deliberately being kept out of discussions held publicly.
I'm glad that charade is over and we are finally telling it like it is.
When you take into account all of Wium-Lee's public pronouncements on this issue it's not unfair to say that a desire to "stick it to Microsoft" plays a large part.
I've had some back-and-forth with the developers at Mozilla, and I've read some of their public correspondence about support for @font-face, and I think their view of this is more a philosophical thing. They don't want to be seen as IP cops. A commitment to the "Open Web", whatever that may mean to them.
Now, I think they're being pig-headed and knee-jerk about it, I think they're not assessing the issues accurately, but I don't think they are specifically looking to stick it to MS.
I can understand your frustration in paying the W3C - what is the yearly now - $65,000.00? only to have to Wium-Lee act like he knows what he's talking about when he talks about fonts. He doesn't. His doctoral thesis was on - big surprise - Cascading Style Sheets. On that subject, I'll take him seriously. Not a lot else.
However, let's move on. The first chapter in this story has already been written. Safari, and soon FireFox and Opera will support linking to font-files. Internet Explorer has supported it for many years, only they implemented it using a different kind of file format - one that enables you to tie the file to the domain name (and local drive letters too, BTW), provides compression to reduce the file size and thus download time, and allows for subsetting, and is not natively installable as a font file in the operating system.
The "DRM effect" of not being able to transplant the file to another domain or install it in the operating system is incidental to this approach. There are perfectly legitimate reasons for these features that have nothing to do with heavy-handed DRM schemes.

But please, talking about "DRM" is just bad PR and won't get you anywhere - IMHO.
Try using some marketing smarts, that will work much better.

Make the fonts you sell for screen use within the browser as well-suited for that purpose as possible. Pay attention to sub-setted variations of those fonts. Make yourselves the authentic, trustworthy alternative to the "drive-by" download that may or may not be missing characters, or suffer from other hidden problems.

Everybody succumbs to flattery: marketing directly to web developers with fonts for THEM, helpful information for THEM, will help you a lot more than flapping EULA's around that are all about YOU, and YOUR rights.

You will simply be ignored.

In a larger sense, start paying attention to browsers and how they handle fonts. Why do I have to pre-process a font in Photoshop, or render it using a text-replacement technique like Cufon to get a headline with the right kerning and smoothing?

Why hasn't the font industry, as a whole, been more vocal and involved in the development of browser technology? (Hey, maybe I'm wrong, but I sure haven't felt any kind of a presence. Some individuals, yes. But not spokespersons.)

If font-linking leads, as some fear it might, to the death of the industry as a viable money-making entity, you should at least take part in and try to manage your own demise.

But you ain't dead yet.

Enough. For now.

Regards,

rich

</em>

My apologies if my choice of words was ambiguous, by 'as is' I simply meant fonts in raw format. I just cannot see how addition of a table that is not recognized by any existing application (and not processed by a browser) would make a difference. I did try hard to understand what it is that you are proposing, but I just don't see how the new permission table is going to change things. Any permissions and limitations that you want to express in this new table I can put in plain English in the existing "License Description" field (see http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm, nameID=13). This information could be used for tracking purposes but I just don't see how it will protect your IP. And, because we already have the "License Description" and "License Info URL" fields in a font, I don't see why you believe a new table is even necessary.

Now back to my original point - raw font linking on the web is not good for a number of reasons, and by allowing it (if you plan to allow it) you may be putting the development of a new solution in jeopardy.

W3C is distracting and could be ignored on this issue if not for all those ugly little formats they support around the big one that everybody has access to now. With W3C's baby step-only approach, a PERM table could stay ahead of that organization for years.

Dave, I am designing, through text, tables and diagrams, one surface of a box from which the other 5 can be developed as the world needs them. I can tell you ahead of the second version in 10 days, that two main areas of this solution; permissions and recommendations, contain Bundling, Compressing, Converting, Embedding, Installing, Linking, Modifying, Serving, Siting, Subsetting, Transferring, &... 1D Scaling, Bolding, Baseline Curving, Decontextualizing, Letter-Spacing, Obliquing, Over Scaling, Striking Through, Stroking, Unhinting, Unkerning, and Underscoring, respectively. 

Each of these will have conditions after a binary choice and the conditions in permissions will be clearly represented and may be echoed in the license. In recommendations, standard units, percentages of standard units and ranges of the same will be defined for the points, pixels and seconds involved. The definitions for each is either found in CSS, or a typographer's dictionary, to be plain.

If we've left out anything anyone else's print or web clients, or client's clients, client's client's clients have asked permission or recommendation for, please give give me a direct shout.

We are all approximately one Apple white paper away from possibility for an open solution that might eventually lead to completeness — aka a long way from last year. :-)

Cheers!

Good. Now get rid of the word "actually" in that sentence and we've made progress.

Anybody who delivers their work product in digital form cannot demand "restrictions". You cannot even grant "permissions" and enforce them in any meaningful way.

But you CAN ask politely and if you want to call them "permissions", fine. And many will abide by your request as long as it not unreasonable and does not impose an unreasonable cost.

Stop waving the EULA flag. Web developers will look at you like you've got two heads. They will not even comprehend what you're talking about.
"What do you mean I can't..., well, to hell with them", is what you're going to get in response.

		<div class="commentbody">What is "waving the EULA flag"?

The EULA is important, and as much as people would like to ignore it, they can't. Ignoring the EULA is actually going to create demand for more DRM as foundries try to protect their products by other, more aggressive means.

Remember that "web developers" are not just a bunch of pirates running free on the Internet. Many of them own or work for companies which must follow the law if they want to survive and succeed. They want a font EULA which lets them do what they need to do, but they are not going to say "to hell with them". There are even plenty of people who who have no particular business interests but are still interested in their EULA and doing the right thing by it.

Richard, I think we're saying similar things, but software developers can indeed "demand restrictions" with their EULA. The law will back them up when necessary. It might be difficult or undesirable to enforce at a micro-level, but you can bet that if Nike or Target or the New York Times ignored their font EULA on a large scale, it would be enforced in a "meaningful way". And I bet even "Bob's Widget Company" doesn't want to willfully violate the terms of any software EULA they have.

Obviously it's in a foundry's interest to create a EULA that is easy to understand and has sensible restrictions, but I don't think EULAs are going away anytime soon. They are a fundamental part of the digital font business, for better or worse.</div>

You sense, rightly, that I'm on YOUR side. If anything is deserving of the protection the US constitution empowers Congress to give "the useful arts", it's fonts.
It's both knowledge and labor intensive. A craft.
But I'm also a realist. And I'm telling you that you'll get farther faster if you adopt a humbler and more market-oriented approach.
(All due respect to Dave Berlow, but there's nothing vague about that.)
Try asking, "Oh, you want to use different fonts in your web pages. How can we help?"
Over the next few years, a huge market will open up for screen fonts. And for the first time, many people who ordinarily don't know a serif from a hole in the wall will become potential customers. For the first time they will have to really think about what font they are going to use and where they are going to get it.
Look, nobody wants to be reduced to saying, on bended knee, "Please, mister, please respect the work that went into my product and pay me my fee." But the Internet has turned copyright law upside down on its head and those much more powerful than you or I have been put in exactly that position.
Look at what a big help legal bravado was to the recording industry.
You can make demands, but who will comply?

Thanks for explaining your position. I've been telling you some things on this thread that you don't want to hear, I know. But that's exactly why I'm telling you.

>Are you supporting only unembedded Embeddable Open Type font linking on the web with fonts identical in content to your print/pdf permitted products?</em>

I am sorry I am not sure what “unembedded Embeddable OpenType” is. When I say “Embedded OpenType” I refer to the data format that is specified here: http://www.w3.org/Submission/2008/01/. The font in EOT format can be directly linked by a webpage using the CSS @font-face.  An EOT file can also be linked back to a webpage (or a domain, a local drive, a file, etc.) using “root string” – sometimes this feature is what people refer to when they differentiate ‘web font linking’ from ‘web font embedding’. The EOT specification doesn’t require this bi-directional linking (i.e. a root string can be empty) but our license does make it a requirement. 
Having said this, I do understand that the future web font file format will be something other than EOT, and that the ability to restrict the use of a font resource to a particular webpage or a domain isn’t a new concept for web designers (e.g. see sIFR spec http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr/Protecting+Commercial+Fonts), and can be implemented using different tools such as CORS http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/.

To answer the second part of your question – yes, any font from Monotype, Linotype, ITC or Image Club libraries can now be licensed for use on the web in EOT format. The fonts you get are exactly the same as you would get if you license them for use in print or PDF.

No actually, now that 'permissions' is a word okay with you, we can make progress. 

>“Oh, you want to use different fonts in your web pages. How can we help?”

Exactly, and this never will happen without recommendations built-in. One thing I don't think anyone's gonna argue with, is that the W3C opened the doors to the largest school of typography in history. 

@Vlad>I am sorry I am not sure what “unembedded Embeddable OpenType” is.

We here consider 'to embed' and 'to link' to be nearly opposite actions with regards to digital data. 

>The fonts you get are exactly the same as you would get if you license them for use in print or PDF.

No founders that I have spoken to are going to allow this. It precludes the fundamental course we have all taken that says our print and PDF licensed fonts are not linkable, ever, according to the terms under which they were licensed. 

Thus, the need for marks in the font to allow other things. And the need for more information in fonts as to their best uses, recommendations, might not look like a big deal here, but 'out there' it is huge. What few people here consider, for example, is that all the 'web fonts' to date, have been 'cherry-picked' from 'all time' to yield a set of practically indestructible choices. That's all about to end.

Back@Richard>...Bitmap representations of fonts are horribly inaccurate when it comes to assessing how the font will actually look when used to present normal HTML text within the browser.

Actually look? Look — for the first time in history licensees can see exactly what a font will look like on *their screen* before they license to link to it. Presenting a specimen, and allowing the user to see actual @ff results is easy. But still and forever, the shopping user can only make informed decisions about their own view. Assessing how the font will actually look when used to present 'normal HTML text' within ANY browser by ANY user employing ANY machine... how?

I'm working on an article about this complete with real-world examples. Title: How To Lose Money On Screen Fonts
Maybe it will shed some light. I'll get word to you as soon as it's posted.
