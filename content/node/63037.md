body: This is apparantly not the 'official' font the 'Give A Smile' foundation uses
  or at least it's not the same as on their site. Sorry about the poor quality of
  the image, but I know this is an easy one, I just can't seem to think of it. Any
  help would be much appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Giveasmile_3882.gif]
