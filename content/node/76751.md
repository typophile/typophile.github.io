  Please turn that off. It\u2019s terrible, because it lowers the readability.\r\n\r\nInstead
  of those things I wish, you would change the color of links. They are almost not
  recognizable."

  body: "I don't expressly dislike the bigger type in the initial post visually, but
    logically I think it's problematic. This sort of thing would make sense in say
    a blog, where the original post is where the core content lies, and everything
    that follows are \xABjust\xBB comments. \r\nBy contrast, in the Typophile forums
    the bulk of the [valuable] content tends to lie in the complete discussion that
    unfolds, not just in the initial post (which might just be a question, etc.).
    So in our case I'd argue that all posts in a given thread should bear the same
    (visual) weight.\r\nThis might be a nice idea for the Blogs though? Maybe. It
    might make them feel more \xABblog-like\xBB, and would also add an additional
    visual difference between them and the Forums \u2013 which may or may not be desired."

  body: I think, it is not only logically problematic. (Who says, that the initial
    post is more important? And who says, that the theme does not change during the
    discussion?) The site is displayed in Georgia here. And at least Georgia is not
    so well legible in that size. In other words, I simply can better read Georgia
    in the smaller size of the posts, that follow the initial post.

    you could try a slightly bigger size for all texts (but as Arno points out, smaller
    than the one now used for initial posts)."

  body: I disagree, that it makes sense in a blog, because in a blog it likewise lowers
    the legibility. But it would make sense to mark it in a different way (in a blog
    only), with a different background color for example. But not with a body text
    size, that is big as a headline.

  body: "@ nina\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a theory, but a personal experience. It\u2019s
    a question of the felt contrast to the background, the thickness of the strokes
    grows overproportional with the font size from a certain point, the contrast between
    the vertical and horizontal strokes grows and the characters drag attention to
    themselves."

    it does nothing for me.\r\n\r\nPlus did you see the size of some of the initial
    posts already? For example, Adam's on the upper case germandbls.\r\n\r\nI've mentioned
    the link colour before and I wasn't the only one. Would it be awful to have links
    in #cc0000? I gather the colour red is lucky in some cultures...\r\n\r\nLove the
    'mark' shape.\r\n\r\nIs it just me or has the leading increased too a fraction?
    Were you hoping no-one would notice or has that been like it for a while? Or has
    it not actually changed and I'm the freak?\r\n\r\nIs Georgia really the best?
    What about some sort of poll? Even if it never gets implemented, the result would
    be interesting.\r\n\r\n"
