  body: "Seems similar to Trooper Roman. One digital version of it I know is called
    [[http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/talon.htm|Talon]], by FontBank. The
    'a' counter seems rounder in your sample, but otherwise it's the closest match
    I have found so far.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    by TypeShop (a.k.a. QBF). It's just close, but maybe close enough?\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "It looks similar but its definitly different. For example the n has just
    one serif stroke at the right bottom. \r\nThe typeface looks very nice by the
    way."

  body: To me it looks like an extra bold weight of Perpetua. There were some pre-digital
    variations like this back in the seventies, but the official source (Monotype)
    doesn't seem to have such a weight in their range.

  body: Other similar fonts are Lapidary 333 Black and Capitolium, although Capitolium
    doesn't look like it too much.

  body: "perpetua extra bold could actually fit very well, thanks mark! \r\n\r\nwould
    anyone have the specimen (or just any print of it from the 70ies) of such a weight
    in his library? i'm very interested in it and would love to have a closer look
    at other letters \u2013 a scan would be just great."

    the \"LI\" in the font number, I would guess that the source of this design may
    have been Lettering Inc. \r\n\r\nThe curve on the bowl of the \"a\" and other
    details are different, but the weight is similar."
