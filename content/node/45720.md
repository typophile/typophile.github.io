  and I'm in the process of looking for some education.  \r\n\r\nI currently am preparing
  to start my second year as a GIC (Graphic and Interactive Communication) major at
  the Ringling College in Sarasota, Florida. I love this school, and have thought
  hard about the decision to transfer out, and while I have not completely decided
  if I will be leaving the country with my family, I need to have my options open.
  It's just hard to think about passing up the opportunity to travel to such a neat
  place. \r\nSo, I extend this question to you, the typophiles, does anyone have any
  experience with the American University in Dubai or any other Art/Design related
  schools in the area? On a related note, does anyone have any experience as a working
  designer in Dubai, or any nearby countries, I'm curious about where the middle east
  stands in the world of Graphic Design.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n- JK "

    faculty. The program is now coed, and is worth checking out. \r\n\r\nDisclosure:
    I'm a MFA student in design at VCU's Richmond campus, and I've met some of the
    faculty that teach there.\r\n\r\n"
