  body: "Nowhere nearly enough context here.\r\n\r\nIs the software running on Windows
    or Mac OSX? If so, then using the system default fonts is almost always a good
    idea unless there is a compelling reason otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhat Unicode coverage
    do you need? How many languages will the software be translated into?\r\n\r\nThe
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DejaVu_fonts\">DejaVu</a> fonts are pretty
    good for screen / UI. The Unicode coverage is excellent, it's legible (nice open
    apertures, large x-height, good balance between economy of space and not being
    too narrow, spacing is decent). It's not an artsy design at all, but it doesn't
    look frumpy or old-fashioned. It's also free.\r\n\r\nYou might also look at <a
    href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_%28font%29\">Droid Sans</a>. It's very
    recent, a little square (which is very trendy right now), and even higher x-height
    and narrower than Deja Vu. Also free.\r\n\r\nIf you've got budget and want to
    do something really creative, there's tons you can do. The <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5288932/palm-pres-fantastic-fonts-custom-designed-by-font-bureau-type-foundry\">Prelude
    fonts</a> by Font Bureau for the Palm Pre are an awesome example.\r\n"

    fresh and modern is of <EM>equal</EM> importance to the hope that operators won't
    kill/maim themselves due to misreading the text? \r\n"

  body: "Thanks for good suggestions, Raph! I especially like the Prelude fonts and
    it's very relevant to look at newer mobile phone fonts (I have also looked at
    Androids font, which also looks good) for some of the software. And yes, there
    is a budget :-)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can't go into much details here, because
    of confidentiality. The fonts will be used in the interface, for buttons, menus,
    body text and numbers. The Unicode coverage is important, good point!\r\n\r\nSii,
    you don't need to get all Jacob Nielsen on me ;-) Let me rephrase, The font (family)
    should look modern and fresh, and at the same time be user friendly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    should probably just contact Ascender Corporation and Fontshop to see what they
    have and what it will cost you.

    designing/developing medical software. I got some constructive points, like which
    OS the software runs on (Linux and Windows btw.) and Unicode coverage, so I don't
    think it's a waste of time. I'm not an expert on typography and just wanted some
    fresh ideas :-)\r\n\r\nDon, I know ;-)\r\n\r\n"
