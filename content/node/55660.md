    designer for the respected Mergenthaler\xB2, Linotype\xB3, Stempel\u2074, and
    Haas typefoundries\u2075. He joined the newly formed digital type supplier, Bitstream,
    Inc\u2076. in 1982. After Berlow left Bitstream in 1989, he founded The Font Bureau,
    Inc\u2077. with Roger Black\u2078. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IE7_4933.JPG]\r\n\r\nFallback

  body: "Ouch, but Thanks \xA1\xA1Sii!! Why would anybody, (wikipedia in my example),
    use the SUP taginstead?\r\n\r\nAnd now, to perhaps answer myownquestion:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/suptext_4079.jpg]\r\n\r\nSafari's
    display of Punchcut's site on a mac (top), seems to get 1, 2 and 3 from glyphs,
    and 4, 5 and 6 from scaling glyphs.\r\nSii's Vista+IE7 (below) is rendering the
    4 like bitmap and the 6 like another character's bitmap. ;)\r\nSo, is that something
    the SUP (the original illustration), avoids... and if it only would get the leading
    into it's brain?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "SUP, like the superscript option in most word processors will raise (and
    sometimes scale) the regular numerals. I'd imagine Wikipedia uses it because most
    system fonts don't contain a full set of the real thing* and because it's machine
    parse-able? There may be ways in CSS/HTML to lock leading, but my guess is that
    support will vary from browser to browser. \r\n\r\nLooking at the fonts on my
    machine, Calibri seems to have them all (Georgia does not), and the design and
    alignment seems consistent. Comparison with Outlook/Word's superscript option.

    sure if this is their intended purpose. "

  body: "Shooting from the hip, I believe you would have to set line-height to a specific
    fixed size for all inline elements within the block to work around this. Since
    most people set line-height, AKA bastardized leading, to relative em heights,
    it is sometimes difficult to accomplish.\r\n\r\nSomeone please correct me if I'm
    wrong, but I'm sure I'm right because I just did something like this.\r\n\r\nFor
    anything that requires Unicode, I make a specific HTML class to make darn sure
    that the fallback font is a full Unicode font. And even then it's iffy to get
    it to work because of the differences in browsers and OS."
