  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This is the business card for my studio Alchion Design Lab (formerly Design Alchemy). Fonts used are Wedding Sans (modified) and Normetica (modified). I did a set of old style numerals based on Wedding Sans, as well as new @ symbol based on my logo+ a few alternate characters. <BR>Color-Orange will be custom mix of flourecent and standard orange, this will be more vibrant that straight orange but not quite flourecent (I have not done this type of tweak in orange yet, but it worked well last time I did this type of mix in yellow.  <BR>Paper is still a consideration- I like Yupo and well as Touch</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have a similar logo (the way it looks on my business card if you take off the 3d effect) and layout for my personal identity. I like the simplicity. I don't think you need the web address since you have an email. It is obvious you have a domain and if people want to put out the effort to look you up they won't have a problem. <BR> <BR>I don't like the line between the icon and type. It feels uneccessary. A solution may be to make your icon black and alchion white. If you do decide to use a line make it go straight up. It is fighting with the icon being diagonal. <BR> <BR>I would like to &quot;design&quot; spread under Alchion to the exact width. It feels too small and since the type is leaning against the icon it seems justifying it to the right doesn't seem&mdash;right. <BR> <BR>I don't know if any of these suggestions will work, I would just like to see more options.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the advice. My intention with using the diagonal was  <BR>partial stylistic, and part practical. It seperates the information and serves as a &quot;loader&quot; on my site (which is still in the works) by sliding back and forths as information loads (using flash). I am taking Tom's advice however and will post various versions later today showing color as being switched as well as the diagonal gone and straight. back on the diagonal topic, I have notices a few sites that use diagonals as shading and loading-example a inch or so of repeating small diagonal stripes even animated. When was this micro-trend started?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the line would work if you made it entirely vertical.  <BR> <BR>I went to your website and I expected it to be more of the style of your card. Your card has a very clean tech feel and the website has so much going on with no definitive logo. I would make your card look more like your website with type going vertically and horizontaly, or make your website look like your card (which I would prefer to see) with a clean style. I know you aren't finished with it yet, but I just wanted to throw that out. <BR> <BR>One more thing- I see what you are doing with the corners of your card, making them the same shape that is in your logo. I think it may come off the viewers like the printer did a poor job of rounding the corners instead of noticing it has the same edges as the icon. I would just round them off. It will be cheaper also.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here is the first card mods. <BR>I find that when I make the &quot;Design Lab&quot; same width as  <BR>&quot;Alchion&quot; by inceasing letter size (vs.spacing letter out), that they do not blend well together, the problem seems to lessen if the &quot;ALCHION&quot; type is lower in height. I have experimented with re-cutting the &quot;ALCHION&quot; letter to lower verticals and leaving horizontals intact ( a few optical adjust ments were made in the process as well). <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/69745.jpg" alt="Alchion letters"></div>

<p>don&rsquo;t letterspace DESIGN LAB under the logotype.  At least not for this one.</p>

<p>I like the salmon, what&rsquo;s the pms?</p>
<p>I second ecco&rsquo;s comments on the logotype.  Loosen the LC or tighten the AL.  Perhaps the logotype could use some more love.  You have some diagonal angles that aren&rsquo;t being incorporated into the letters.</p>
<p>good work though.  if tech modern is what you are aiming for, then bullseye to you</p>
