  Bronze\r\n\r\n                     Contemporary & Classy/Modern\r\n\r\n                     Brushed
  Steel Benches with Black Leather\r\n\r\n                     Straight Lines\r\n\r\n
  \                    Silver w/Black accents\r\n\r\n                     Taupe w/Green
  in it\r\n\r\n                     Soft Blue shimmer in massage area\r\n\r\nThis

  body: "I don\u2019t really feel like any of these really work. A & B look dated,
    like something I saw on a shampoo bottle a few years ago. C & D are just gratuitous
    and don\u2019t reflect high-style. E looks like you were starting something and
    walked away from it in the middle of merging some letters, F looks like it goes
    on an environmentally-friendly kids product."

  body: Thanks for your input James. Do you have any suggestions as to which direction
    I should pursue... Are there any of these I should try to develop more or should
    I just go back to the drawing board?

  body: I think D had the most potential. Fits the brief best. I would work on that.
