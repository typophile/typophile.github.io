  body: "Wow, nice find, Jan. Looks about right.\r\n\r\nToo bad LettError doesn't
    provide a better sample at their site, the lc t is slightly different/changed,
    was wondering if there where more inconsistencies. Could just be an older version
    though...\r\n\r\nAlways love to find new and obscure fonts, this one looks great.
    Not too happy about the kerning in that PDF though, but could be bad design.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    thanks!"

    And strange that you can\u2019t set your own sample with LettError\u2019s very
    own LetterSetter. And there is no specimen of Critter available."

    is the one I made for the Sans Serif Font ID Guide. It was called New Critter,
    perhaps because of the Adobe animal dingfont called Critter.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NewCritterLTR_3853.gif]"

  body: Judging from the fact that in the PDF it's called Libertango; they probably
    didn't like the "t", changed it and renamed the font.
