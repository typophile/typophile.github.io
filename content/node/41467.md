body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am recently creating a font for a band. Their name is \"the
  drei - gottes vorband\" which means \"the three - god's support act\". Don't be
  distracted by the name, it's nothing religious.\r\nThe band's concept is having
  fun with funny lyrics and being a wannabe rock musician without really knowing how
  to play their instruments.\r\n\r\nThis is why I made it look rough and not precisely
  elaborated. Which kind of music would you associate it with? I'm doubting a little,
  that it fits with rock music.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think so far?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDirk\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TheDrei-Schrift_3542.jpg]"

  body: The main potential problem with this design is that it might be useless in
    a few months when the <a href="http://typophile.com/node/42643">fat font fad</a>
    fades.

  body: "This is great!  \r\n\r\nIt makes me think of Leningrad Cowboys or Six-String
    Samurai or The Monks -- like a avant-garde punk band that came out of Eastern
    Europe or Communist Russia in the late Sixties.\r\n\r\nThe R is my favorite and
    the I, S, and Z are particularly nifty. \r\n\r\nI want to see the numbers!\r\n\r\nWhen/where
    can we download this font once it's done?\r\n\r\n-matt\r\n\r\nP.S. And don't worry
    about this looking useless -- even if it was <em>just</em> catering to a fad,
    which it isn't, the fat font fad comes back around every few years. :)"

  body: "Thanks for your comments,\r\n\r\nI see, that it follows a fad. But this in
    no reason to stop doing experiments.\r\n\r\nI don't think, that this font will
    be downloadable too soon. This version is created in Illustrator. I don't have
    any experience with Fontlab or other font-tools.\r\nBut maybe it's done, when
    there will be the next fat font fad...\r\n\r\nThose are the numbers:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TheDrei-numbers_4867.jpg]"

  body: "\"fat font fad fades\"\r\n\r\nJust wanted to repeat that as it's so fun to
    say.\r\n\r\nYea, it's fat, but still fairly unique, IMHO. I like it."

  body: "I think that the two diagonal sides of the 7 (and the ?, Z, and S) are at
    slightly different angles. That looks odd.\r\n\r\nCould you post a high-resolution
    version or a PDF? I might be able to notice more quirks like that if you do. \r\n\r\n-matt"
