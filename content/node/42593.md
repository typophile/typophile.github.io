    name Syrway but the letters don't appear to work.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I dunno but
    I like the font choice in #2 more than #1."

  body: I like the second one; the identity's width is closer to the letters' widths
    in the second one. I think it'd look even better if you shortened the identity
    such that the very top of it was at x-height and the very bottom went only just
    past the baseline.

  body: I like the second one better too but I don't know what the "mask" is about.
    Are you in theater? If so, then do your clients need to know that? Id so then
    great. If not it may be getting in the way of a message they do need to hear.
    The name itself is hard to know how to say. That could be a problem.

  body: "Based on your user name, the symbol is not to be read as a letter, as many
    of the above posters are suggesting. You might remove this distraction by making
    the symbol a larger or smaller size, moving it from the baseline, and perhaps
    throwing it to the start or end of the words, where additional space can make
    it clearly separate.\r\n\r\nI find the tracking too high on the top offering,
    and really am not enamoured with the second, either."

  body: "I for one in a haste didn't notice the scrollbar and thought that the \"w\"
    was the end of the logo.  Now that I've seen the whole thing, I think that the
    \"YY\" symbol in the middle is still too distracting.  If it needs to stay in
    the middle of the word, try making it smaller than the rest of the letters, put
    it on the end like Don suggested, or making two... one for the front and back
    to envelope the word rather than separate it.\r\n\r\n=====\r\nhttp://goscreative.com\r\n"
