  body: My thought exactly, Chesh, but I was too plain lazy to go double-check and
    confirm it this afternoon. You snooze, you loose. ;&#41; Thank god you&#39;re
    more reliable than I am today.

  body: I noticed that, too, but given how undistinctive it looks, even tiny, I figured
    the poster simply misnamed his request, which wouldn&#39;t have surprised me.
    The Caslon is way more interesting and, thus, more worthy of being id&#39;d, even
    if it wasn&#39;t the poster&#39;s request. It&#39;s his own fault, methinks. Plus,
    in my meager defense, that particular Caslon wasn&#39;t exactly a breeze to id,
    at least for me. There are at least three different digital swash cuts out there.

    id. I was just teasing the both of you. And maybe Trouble is right, It could be
    that I&#39;m just jealous. <BR> <BR>;^&#41;

  body: 'Tiffany, I&#39;m not upset at you in the least. I was responding mostly to
    the recent comment from the original poster that the id request was a joke, that
    he really did mean the &#34;Polo Fields&#34; part and that he didn&#39;t expect
    anyone to actually guess it. So there are two possibilities, as I see it: <BR>
    <BR>1. It really was a joke. If so, I don&#39;t need to be sent on a wild goose
    chase. <BR> <BR>2. It wasn&#39;t really a joke; he actually wanted the Caslon,
    and he was making light of the subsequent responses. If so, I&#39;m just tired
    of him. &#34;No asky, no gety&#34; is my motto, but he takes it a little far.
    I&#39;m now developing a corollary: &#34;Too much asky, no gety.&#34; <BR> <BR>The
    killer was that he thought I was joking when I said I was boycotting any further
    requests of his. Maybe that&#39;s his problem -- he can&#39;t tell what a joke
    actually is. I was trying to be gentle and harsh at the same time, and it didn&#39;t
    take.'
