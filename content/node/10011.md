body: I have been working on a custom lettering for a hosting company logo. For 2
  days however I am trying to get the &#34;s&#34; right. Here is the result so far
  - the faded type is the old version. If you see problems with the other letters,
  speak out.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/68344.gif"

  body: Hi Anastas, <BR> <BR>The vertical strokes &#40;stems&#41; on your &#34;c&#34;
    &#34;d&#34; and &#34;o&#34; are straight. In my opinion, you must therefore bring
    a straight element into your &#34;s&#34; <BR> <BR>I hate drawing curves, too.
    Hang in there. It gets better

  body: Hi Dan, <BR> <BR>I guess you are right. The type is based on the rounded rectangular-ish
    &#34;o&#34; so I guess the curves of the &#34;s&#34; should keep with that style.
    Back to the drawing board for me.
