  so it would keep as much resemblance as possible to the original drawing.\r\n\r\n<img

  that you are having great time!"

  body: "Hi! I would do it in illustrator CS. \r\nGo to Object>Live trace and then
    make. You can do some experiment to achieve what you want. Note: You can clean
    it up in Photoshop  by adjusting the contrast so that you don't have the in between
    gray stuff . Photoshop>Image>adjustments>brightness/contrasts.\r\nGood luck      "

  body: This makes no sense to trace. There's so much detail it'll be much better
    presented as a bitmap.

  body: Look at Illustrator brushes, you wont get the depth os shade with a single
    layer but you could reproduce a image similar to the above with a  few different
    layers. Although as Frode says it will look better as a bitmap.

  body: How about an outline trace copied to PS and a few layers of noise and gradients.
    I can give it a try, if you're interested. Or yes, a brush in Illustrator.

    of maintain the tonalities by creating two  (or even better three) traces using
    the lighter tonal one(s) to knockout what's needed from the darker tone.\r\n\r\nn."

  body: Coreldraw has the best auto tracer ever.  You'd be able to fine tune how big
    of specs you would like in it, as well as how much or little smoothing you'd like,
    and a host of other things.  I've never really seen anything else that comes close
    to it, if only it had an option for making certain line segments straight when
    they are close enought already being straight (handy when tracing the flat parts
    of letters) I would never use anything else.  I believe Coreldraw 12 and earlier
    versions are free now.

    vector texture to give that spotted look.
