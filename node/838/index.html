		<div class="commentbody">Nine.Two.Two. <BR> <BR>Have used X since public beta (18 months ago), but basically can't stand it for long as it's buggy and slow. If the UI and speed issues get sorted out I'll make the switch, but it's a long way from there yet. I also don't find it any more stable than 9.x, despite what's claimed. <BR> <BR>I go through stages of trying X for a week or so, but it quickly wears out its welcome. <BR> <BR>So, sticking with 9. <BR> <BR>On the other hand I've just set up a web server using X, and I'm reasonably happy with that - but then there are no user interface issues with a server. <BR> <BR>We're currently running one web server on 8.6, one on 9.2 and one on X - how's that for consistency. <BR> <BR>Er&hellip; and the networking setup in X isn't flexible enough for my needs. <BR> <BR>Steve Jobs said at the recent (Apple) World Wide Developers Conference that 1 million people were using X at the beginning of the year, and he hopes for 5 million by the end of the year. Frankly, 1 million is pitiful, and marks what people really think of X despite all the hype - it's around 3% of the installed base. To get to 5 million all Apple has to do is claim that most of the Macs they ship this year are &quot;actively&quot; running X.</div>

I've wanted OS X since the days when they were calling it NextSTEP, but I'm going to have to buy a new machine to run it. I have a Pismo with 192MB, so it'll run X just fine, just not with all the Cubase, Recycle, and Edirol stuff I'm using. The Big Three audio editors still don't support it. <BR> <BR>When FontLab 4 comes out for OS X, I'll likely buy a new machine. <BR> <BR>Honestly, I can't stand pre-X MacOS.

		<div class="commentbody">I didn't much like OSX at first, but I am trying to integrate it into my life little by little. Initially, everything I did was in Classic mode, which is utterly pointless. I think the whole concept of Classic was a big mistake on Apple's part. Like swimming in a mountain lake, the only way to do it is to dive in. All or nothing. Otherwise it's tippy-toe torture, and that's exactly what Classic is. <BR> <BR>Early on, pretty much all I did was fiddle with the OS for a few moments once or twice a week, but now I have Photoshop, Illustrator, BBEdit and Toast running native. Once FontLab, QXP and Dreamweaver are X'd, I'll use it more often. <BR> <BR>Besides not having my favorite apps native, the thing that drives me the most nuts about X is saving and opening files from dialog boxes. Sometimes I have no idea how I navigated to a particular volume and folder&hellip; Sometimes it seems like the OS won't let me save/open stuff where I want it, and if I do manage, I fear I'll never find it again! In other words, some of the most basic tasks are rendered needlessly complex in X. <BR> <BR>For the time being, the OS versions mirror the breakdown &ndash; OS9=90% of my time, OSX=10% (at most). <BR> <BR>- Sean</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Again, John, I need to keep 9.0.4 on there to run the audio editing stuff. It doesn't even run under 9.1, otherwise I could use Classic. And audio editing is very, very dependent upon timing issues, and the main audio software packages (Cubase, Logic, Cakewalk) are only just starting to ship OS X versions. It's apparently very hard to write software to control timing inside OS X. Reason is shipping, which is cool, but I require Cubase for the VST support. (ReWire is the answer to a question nobody asked.) <BR> <BR>But there will be a G4 or G5 in my future, probably early next year, depending on how business goes, and depending on when Apple finally sorts its G5 fabrication issues. (Or bails and goes with Intel.) <BR> <BR>Personally, I think they should approach AMD.</div>
