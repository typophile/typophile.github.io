body: "I'm working on a PowerPoint presentation for a client. I need to consolidate
  several PowerPoints, clean them up and add graphics. \r\n\r\nThe text contains a
  lot of arrow characters, and for some reason I'm having trouble with the arrows
  when I copy and paste them. If I paste them as \"unformatted text\" -- which I prefer
  to do as it strips away previous formatting -- they change to underlines.  (Edit
  > Paste Special > Unformatted Text)  If I paste them in the regular, formatted way
  they are fine, but I'd prefer not to do that.\r\n\r\nAt first I assumed it was due
  to a font change, but it's not, it's still in Arial as before.  (Unfortunately I'm
  stuck using Arial because it's their corporate font for PowerPoints).\r\n\r\nI can
  work around this problem, but why is it occurring? All the rest of the text appears
  to copy and paste just fine. I'm using a Mac."

  body: Arial contains a few anemic arrows but, most likely, the arrows in the PPT
    presentation are from one of the Wingding fonts. Consequently, using your preferred
    method, you're stripping the code which will render the proper character. For
    this project, change YOUR preferences and save yourself a lot of headaches...
