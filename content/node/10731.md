  some messy MSWord tables into pleasant ones in InDesign, and after reading entire
  11 pages devoted to tables in the manual i&#39;m thinking, not... but it&#39;s friday
  afternoon so i could just be experiencing feigned incompetence syndrome :  &#41;'

  body: 'InDesign has a scaling tool for test. It&#39;s that thing that looks like
    a picture frame &#40;with the usual computer-object-handles&#41; and a white cursor.
    If you give that thing a keyboard shortcut, you&#39;re quicker at the scaling
    text function. '

  body: 'With InDesign, btw, you can just copy the Word-Table into the document. It
    will look exactly like it does in Word &#40;if you didn&#39;t do too much fancy
    stuff in Word&#41; and you can still fully edit it. If you work a lot with tables
    and would like to get around this a bit quicker, I&#39;d recommend Smart Styles
    from Woodwing, a tool any InDesign user should give a look, it&#39;s quite productive. '

  body: i think my original question should&#39;ve been, can i make table styles in
    inDesign, as i can in frameMaker &#40;without that handy plugin HD mentions&#41;?
    frameMaker has lots of issues as a design tool but it can do some pretty amazing
    stuff for big documents that i&#39;m trying now to figure out how to do in inDesign.
    another example is dynamic auto footers that read off headings on a page? is that
    possible? sorry if this is the wrong place for this question.
