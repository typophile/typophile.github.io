  that reads "French Chic". It looks quite similar to Carisma Light, but I know some

    Bazaar Magazine. Previously asked [[http://www.typophile.com/node/68068|here]]

    magazines, it could be a bespoke typeface exclusively designed for the magazine.\r\nFrom
    one of the above page, you could get various suggestions for \"[[http://typophile.com/node/67084|ultra
