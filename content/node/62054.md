    instead of "recommend".

  body: "If I were recommending the font itself then I might say \"advertise\" but
    what I was promoting here was the article about how the font was made, which I
    think is an interesting read for people interested in how fonts are developed.
    Apparently you don't share that interest and probably didn't bother to read the
    article, so why are you commenting?\r\n\r\nDave"

  body: But you wrote the article? That's self-promotion, which is always welcome
    here, so long as it's acknowledged as such.
