  body: "It's not identical, but [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/script-pro/regular/|Berthold
    Script Pro]] is fairly similar. Apparently, from looking at the font samples the
    tracking can be adjusted to make the letters connect better, which would make
    it look more like your sample. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure that your sample is a font.
    The F is quite unusual, I think. At least it doesn't look like one I have seen.\r\n\r\n-
