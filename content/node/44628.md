  cool to watch this design come together. Very high levels of detail, and most of
  it free handed. Wait till you see the part were he makes the girl and her cat. \r\n\r\nTotal
  time was about 40 hours over a 6 month span. "

    a seizure somewhere in there. The best part about the girl and the cat is how
    small they actually appeared in the layout.

  body: 'I was more impressed that he freehand drew everything, especially the cat
    and girl. I''m not much of a freehand illustrator, so I''m not sure how difficult
    it would be for someone who knows how to do it well. To me, it would have been
    incredibly frustrating. '

  body: I can just see "the boss" ranting over the amount of time taken to build the
    cat and girl, with such detail, and then using them at such a tiny size. Onscreen
    they are practically invisible. I wonder if the quality matters in the full sized
    print.

  body: "That was mind-blowing.\r\n\r\nI think I'm gonna have a cool drink of water,
    then look at it again -- and this time, my neighbours are going to hear I like
    it! How can you even <em>work</em> with such a beat in the background!?\r\n\r\n(Technically,
    I'm very impressed with the incessant zoom-in-detail-zoom-out routine. I tend
    to focus on tiny details for hours, only to find it looks like cr*p in a larger
    view.)"
