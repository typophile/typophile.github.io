  body: "Not at all Frode. Non members pay a higher fee. I haven't been a member for
    years.\r\n\r\nIf you're a non member and decide you want to join ATypI and attend
    the conference, those combined fees are greater than the conference fee for members.
    Seems like a missed opportunity to increase membership."
