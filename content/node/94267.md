  made in Knockout ?\r\n\r\nPreferably:\r\na)  a simple clean, legible sans (e.g.
  helvetica or news gothic)\r\nb) a beautiful, pretty serif (e.g. sabon or georgia)\r\n\r\nThe
  headlines will be using one of the Knockout styles 26/46/66 or 27 /47/67\r\n\r\nthankyou!\r\n"

  body: "Those are extremely condensed faces, so whatever you use will contrast in
    several ways. Therefore, just about anything will work, but each in its own way\u2014play
    around with leading, size and line length. This is an opportunity to become familiar
    with a face that you \uFB01nd interesting and attractive, and develop the best
    setting for it vis-a-vis these very condensed styles."

  body: In the (very limited) work I've done pairing typefaces, I've found Gill sans
    works well with condensed sans like trade gothic, so I suppose that would fit
    pretty well with knockout.
