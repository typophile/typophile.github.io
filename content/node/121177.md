body: "I have an interesting request.  I have a client who wants a powerful handwritten
  font that looks like it was scrawled with emotion.  She wants a strong emphasis
  on a capital B, and to a lesser extent a capital L and A.  I have tried drawing
  her multiple copies but she wants something that is more cohesive I guess.  These
  are the three examples she has given of what she wants it to look similar to.  Any
  suggestions would be amazing!  Thanks!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3909.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5140.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_6448.jpg]"

  body: She also doesn't mind paying for a font as long is it captures the emotions
    and ideas she is looking for.

    and <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/smudger/' target='_blank'>Smudger</a>
    come to mind. The latter has an Alt font that contains ligatures and alternates
    for some letters - including the B.
