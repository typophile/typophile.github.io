body: "Hi Everyone- I'm hoping you can help me out. I'm getting married on September
  7. I just received my wedding invitations from a vendor on Etsy. The invitations
  were supposed to look like the picture, however, they showed up with black and dark
  pink ink instead of dark gray and light pink. I can't go back to the original vendor
  who messed up because she\u2019s (conveniently) on vacation until July 14. And I
  can't change my wedding colors this late in the game. I can, however, recreate the
  invitation and reprint it in the right color ink. I just need to find out what font
  she used. Any ideas?? Thank you for your help!!!!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Invitation_4189.jpg]"

      you can do the cute ampersand too!
