body: "Today, James completed this totally amazing nameplate for a custom bass guitar.
  The mother of pearl shell is .060\" thick and he used a jeweller's saw to cut the
  letters completely through the shell. Then the sawn out sections are filled with
  a mixture of epoxy and ebony dust. \r\n\r\nThe plate is to be installed on a fingerboard
  with a twelve inch radius, so the form will distort a little after shaping. On the
  next one, I'll correct the artwork to allow for this final step.\r\n\r\n"

    customer loved it, and we're making him another bass with a different nameplate.
    The next one will be \"Scooter\" inlaid with the same technique, but with a different
    font, something to pay tribute to his recently deceased cat. "
