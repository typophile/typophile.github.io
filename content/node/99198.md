  body: My first impression is that it looks more like an odd B rather than EB. Maybe
    it would help if the E wasn't so condensed.

  body: My suggestion would be to use an E that's the same style/proportions as the
    B, and extend the width of the B (the white area) further to the left.  Another
    idea would be to try a lower case E.

    pure typographical constructs with no obvious references, your looks quite a bit
    like a zipper. '
