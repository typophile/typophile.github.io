body: Hi everyone! Can someone send me some links of font PDF catalogs? I&#39;m currently
  interning with Chank and am compiling his fonts into a nice PDF catalog. I&#39;ve
  checked some of the major type foundries &#40;house, emigre&#41; and none of them
  have one. I&#39;m just trying to get some layout ideas. Any help would be apprecited

    has theirs online. It&#39;s a couple of years old, but shows a ton of fonts. <BR>
    <BR>Doesn&#39;t Storm also have all his specimens online in PDF?

  body: PDF specimens are a lovely idea, but the security for embedded fonts is too
    weak for my liking. Extracted fonts lack hinting and kerning, so are probably
    too much trouble for people wanting to pirate text faces, but the opportunity
    to strip a display face from a PDF and, within a few minutes, have a working version
    with which to create a headline or web graphic is more temptation than I would
    like to put before a lot of people.

    works some of the time, and even then you rarely get anything really usable. <BR>

    John? <BR> <BR>I think Jeremy Tankyard&#39;s website has PDFs, but he converted
    all the fonts to outlines, so it will print well. He compensates the lack of crispness
    in the PDFs by having a online test-driver &#40;which isn&#39;t fully piracy-proof
    either afaik&#41;. <BR>That&#39;s the best alternative i&#39;ve seen around.

  body: I&#39;m sorry, I thought this thread was about PDF specimens. It appears to
    be about What Hrant Has To Say About Yanks. My mistake. <BR> <BR>One way of strengthening
    PDF security is to use Type-&#62;Create Outlines or similar. A cracker can still
    blow away time re-importing them into a font editor and adding the metrics on
    his own, but the amount of time needed to reconstruct such a font adequately will
    usually be worth more in an adequately skilled person&#39;s dollars than the cost
    of simply buying a license. The downside of Create Outlines is that there is no
    hinting. Supposedly the newer versions of Acrobat will anti-alias line art. I&#39;ll
    try making some comparisons this weekend or so.

  body: Department stores could probably eliminate shoplifting if they kept all their
    inventory in a vault and only let customers see pictures of merchandise. And yet
    they don&#39;t because they&#39;d lose more business than the losses they&#39;d
    eliminate. <BR> <BR>I think PDF specimens are a good idea. The risk of extraction
    is pretty small, especially since you end up with something less than the real
    font. Selling a font is <i>much </i>riskier. Once it&#39;s out in the world, anything
    can happen.
