  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">A small subset of this forum resides in the city of Calgary. And we have taken to meeting once a week at a local pub to continue our discussions about type. (Also, some beer drinking is involved.)

This is a general invitation for any others in the Calgary area who would like to accompany us. The conversation isn't always about serifs and such, and there are other people at the table who aren't typophiles. Everybody is welcome. Bring a friend, bring a spouse. Bring a biker gang. No appetite for beer? Still welcome.

Other typophiles passing through the city (yeah, right!) are also invited.

Interested? Feel free to contact Linda Cunningham or myself for details.</div>

Of which there are many.  :-(  And the only beer you can get on the grounds tastes like they took the stall bedding and wrung it out.  Blech.

But in general, I like Stampede too -- I must, or I wouldn't keep working as a volunteer at it.

Unfortunately, there's a serious push on to make the whole "Stampede Experience" (blech) warmer, fuzzier, and a whole lot less "icky" and "offensive" to city slickers.  :-(

(You can still learn to milk a cow at Stampede, except it's a full-sized, plastic cow so no one -- cow or human -- gets hurt. And if you go into the barns, there's all kinds of signs around saying no one is liable if anything happens, and "don't forget to wash your hands when you leave." That sure wasn't how the west was tamed: a century ago, men were men and sheep were nervous.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A short report after a successful meeting:

We managed to assemble a goodly portion of Veer's jigsaw puzzle. We were hampered by the overall painted artwork on the surface of Table 49. It interfered with the {same color palette of the} puzzle. There was some beer drinking and throwing of jigsaw pieces involved. But the typographic bits of the puzzle got done. 

We're sending a package off to Veer which includes a large portion of the puzzle (assembled or not), some beer-stained coasters, and possibly a few well-gnawed chicken bones.

Lex was unavailable because of previous commitments, so we put his name to the courier waybill.</div>

The eastern/southern version of a classic summer biz style would be the pink/powder blue seersucker suit. And a bow tie. When I first arrived in T.O. in the 1970s, there would still be a few around on Bay St. The summer version with shorts and a straw hat, maybe even a boater (very Mad. Av.) was way cool. But I guess you could wear seersucker with cowboy boots and a Stetson? No doubt Veer has a stock shot...</div>
