body: How do you break-up relationships, typographically? <BR> <BR>Do you use &#42;nice&#42;
  hand-lettered cards or just Post-It notes on the fridge? <BR>I heard there are some
  nice ones for that occasion from Hallmark, too. <BR> <BR>So dear fellow Typophiles
  what&#39;s <b>your</b> solution?

    apparently the topic was music as I leared later on... so I&#39;m not sure about

    Post-It handy, ha! <BR> <BR> <BR>Once I made a &#42;nice&#42; card, using only
    Comic Sans and Brush Script - was satisfying for me at that point ;&#41;'
