  pieces of work they could produce quickly, if simply for nothing but their curiosity

    own one or two - and remember when FontFont (I'm sure that's where I go them...)
    I remember talking to the folks in Canada ans they told me this was the new wave
    of type - and would replace all. Give me shapes and we'll give you letters...."

    *that* project) that FF are selling, and I *definitely* didn't purchase them.
    \r\n\r\nI also remember the FTP servers they used as link outs from the website
    being notoriously slow as they were shredded when new faces went live with accompanying
    poster. It took me about 8years of successive FTP failures to get Moonbase Alpha,
    which I saw in Wired. Obviously if they were not all sold, the legality of use
    is now in question (CanYou I used I think). I could of course be dreaming the
    whole exercise. :/\r\n\r\n--rambling questions--\r\n1. Wasn't Blur initially a
    Brody face for FUSE or was it a separate project?\r\n2. In another thread russellm
    said, \"It could be an interesting exercise to use type to influence the mood
    of the reader and the way the book is read, like the sound track in a movie...\".
    FUSE instantly sprung to mind then in one of their poster sets...anyone remember?\r\n--/rambling
    questions--"

    quite, but I think it was more along the lines of conveying opposite emotional
    responses to the text via the typography.\r\n\r\nSimilar in a way I assume to
    seeing the word \"orange\" in blue lettering, and other such cod psychological
    tests you can find viraling their way into your inbox. \r\n"

  body: When I had to buy Blur - it was sold at FontFont as one of the Fuse Fonts.
    I cannot forget that. Never saw it before. The book for Aeon Flux (remember that
    book guys...) was given to me to "fix" up for pre-press -- Blur was used on one
    or two of the pages. Then I never saw it again...
