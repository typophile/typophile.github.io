body: "Good afternoon to all my type-lovers. I'm designing my wedding collateral and
  have here the first of many. My fienc\xE9 says she sees an F instead of an S in
  Sarah, so I'm hoping for suggestions on how to get a better S.\r\n\r\nI believe
  a more pronounced lower spine would do the trick, but it would disrupt the stress/angle
  of the font. Solutions and suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\nIn general, Sarah is looking
  for something intimately elegant, vintage (yet not trendy vintage), and with bold
  damask whispers for the look and feel of the wedding. Suggestions are welcome!"
