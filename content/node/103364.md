  body: "I suppose you mean the \"Infinity\" script at bottom right?\r\nIt is published
    as <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/carpenter/|Carpenter Script]]</strong>
    by James West (GroupType, 1993-06), also published as <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Image-Club-Graphics&ffam=Carpenter%20ICG%20-%20Regular&fid=ed5f15f3d21a6471339c40baed679c07&fsize=60&text=Infinity&fit=1|Carpenter

    by Dan X. Solo. (1999, Dover Publications CD)\r\nIt's also available as <strong>OPTICarmella
    HandScript</strong> (Castcraft Software, Inc. 1990-1991) and cloned under different
    names by several well-known font forgery companies like NovelFonts, FontBank &
    SoftMaker.\r\n\r\nI don't know what \"sweet paper\" is, but some contrast & perspective
    correction might help somebody else to find out:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sweet-paper-01_5594.jpg]\r\n"
