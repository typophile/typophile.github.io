body: Typesetting a book in Quark 7, not my usual software. Typeface is Hoefler.  I've
  noticed that the automatic hyphens are riding too high in the text, brushing up
  against the characters, especially "r". I checked against the HFJ website, and it's
  not a font quirk, it's something that Quark is doing.  I can't find a method to
  edit this so they display correctly. Anyone experience this and know how to fix?

  body: I tested it in Indesign and I did  the same. Seems to come from the typeface
    himself. Seems the hyphen has been set for the caps letters. Maybe send a question  to
    HFJ. Sorry no other solution for now.

  body: 'Thanks! It''s very odd, because I did a "test drive" with this font on the
    foundry''s website, and they show it displaying more toward the middle of the
    x-height. But it''s also weird that InDesign does the same thing (I always like
    to blame quark for these things...). Dashes are doing the same thing, as well.
    I''ve written tech support and will let you know what I find out (if anything). '

  body: 'This has nothing to do with Quark. This is a problem with the Hoefler Text
    fonts included in OS X. There are two hyphen and dash vertical positions: standard
    and uppercase. The positions are swapped in these fonts. The Baskerville and maybe
    a few other OS X fonts have the same issue. I planned to file a bug with Apple
    but haven''t yet.'

  body: After a quick check I found at least 4 other fonts that have the same issue
    with one or more dashes. This includes Courier New! I wonder how long these bugs
    have been around and how many OS X users have been working with the fonts oblivious
    to the problems. I first noticed the Hoefler Text issue at least 3 years ago.
