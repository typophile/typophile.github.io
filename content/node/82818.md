  body: "BTW, samples with more upper case letters are especially helpful with serif
    fonts. This sample had only H, D and B, none of which is usually an earmark letter.
    From my point of view, which is using the Serif Guide, the E, J, K, M, R, U and
    W are keys, but also G, C and Q. The a, g and y are usually the most helpful lower
    case letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
