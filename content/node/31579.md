      Mac and a number of crashes. Right now we just have the beta photoshop cs3 which

      You need money.\r\nJeff Spicoli: All I need are some tasty waves, a cool buzz,

    they say \"in an upcoming issue,\" not \"our next issue,\" one might speculate
    that they're hinting at a CS3 release before the April/May issue is published."
