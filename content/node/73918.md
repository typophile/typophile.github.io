  talk page, a user spelled the name of the Yanomamo people with an ogonek, yet the
  article is spelled with a combining cedilla. I could easily elect to use no diacritics
  and use the more common Yanomami spelling, but that would be fun at all!\r\n\r\nSo...
  how is it spelled?\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"
