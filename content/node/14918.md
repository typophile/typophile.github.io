  body: "It could be one of the fonts Gerrit Noordzij has created for his own use.
    His son Peter Mathias is the founder of The Ensched\xE9 Type Foundry (http://www.teff.nl/index.html)
    and as far as I know they are going to publish some of these fonts. Ruse is one
    that's available now (but not similar to your sample)."
