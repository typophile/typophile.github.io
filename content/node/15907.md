    upside down towards a mirror and then look at it. Relax your eyes, gaze at a copy
    block and don't even try to read it. See if you notice any areas that seem darker
    or lighter within the text block.\r\n\r\nIf you do, then the spacing is either
    too tight or too loose in that area. If you don't, then either your spacing/kerning
    is fine, or need to continue training in typography... that is, if you're still
    interested.\r\n\r\n"
