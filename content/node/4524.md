  body: 'Thank for your comments Ole. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m gonna work some more versions
    of S, I think that C needs to have that long base because of it&#39;s plain bottom,
    but i&#39;ll work on it too. <BR> <BR>Here is the PDF file. <BR>Take a closer
    look. <BR>.<!--attachment: AlmaticaBetaV-34711.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*505.3**AlmaticaBetaV%2epdf

  body: Top of uc G is a bit long, as is the hook on lc r. 7 leans a bit to the right.
    <BR> <BR>You might have kerning issues given the variation in letter shapes, though.
