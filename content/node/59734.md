  is helping out on the day of my wedding and I will design a logo and business card
  for her. Budget-friendly for both of us!\r\n\r\nI have been sketching out some ideas
  and one of them I really like but would appreciate some critique before I send all
  the ideas to her. I showed an earlier version to my fianc\xE9 and he said it didn't
  read well, so I worked on it some more. I really like it, but I know the name and
  have been staring at it. I am wondering if I am beating a dead horse or if I am
  on to something. I appreciate all your wisdom and input!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nNatalie\r\n\r\nPS.
  The name of the company is Humble Olive. It's a bit odd, I know. My fianc\xE9 said
  the earlier version read Humb Le Olive."

    way.\r\nMaybe thicken the circular border slightly--but I like the rough sketched
    circle that isn't perfect.\r\n\r\nThe only part that bothers me is there's a bit
    of dead space in the center. With some tweaking of the letters that negative space
    wouldn't draw as much attention."

    I see the oval as a solid shape behind the type representing an olive. But the
    outline idea could be an option too, thanks.\r\n\r\nYes, I am aware of the dead
    space in the middle. I will try and work that out later. :-)\r\n\r\nNatalie"

  body: "I think the main reason that it might read 'Humb Le Olive' is the 'e's are
    lowercase while all the other letters are uppercase. So right away, the brain
    organizes the information\u2014capital 'L' followed by lowercase 'e' makes it
    look like a separate word. It also doesn't help that the 'L' is much lower than
    the 'B' further separating it. The direction you're going is great though. Stay
    with it. \r\n\r\npenn"

    begins to look like the dimple of an olive.\r\nI wonder of the letterforms could
    start to take on the rest of the form of an olive\u2014more specifically the roundness.\r\nIf
    you did so, then you could loose the green shape and have the logotype take on
    \"olive-ness\"\r\nDoes that make any sense?\r\n\r\nIt's really nice work. Olive

  body: "This is spectacular.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome ideas:\r\n\r\nI would go with marcdavid
    and eliason and take an even closer look at the roundings. I think that the 'O'
    is very important for the overall impression the artwork is communicating. To
    support the olive-shaped background it would be nice to see it a little rounder.
    I also highlighted the other areas where I would make it a bit rounder.\r\n\r\nNevertheless
    this looks awsome and I would like to get my events planned by someone who's represented
    by this piece of art."

    of an olive as in volume.\r\nI know it's a quite an investment to explore, but
    it may be very interesting. although the letterforms you've designed are quite
    interesting themselves.\r\nMaybe shifting the cross bar down in the H could help
    with the balance of that letterform. following is an illustration of my earlier
    comment.\r\n\r\nit's a very nice mark. where will the event planner be located?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/volume_6498.png]"
