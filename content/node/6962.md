    inspiration this way: <BR> <BR>Godfather &#43; Sopranos = Trigger Man <BR> <BR>I
    was not saying that Sopranos is derivitive of The Godfather. Especially since
    they&#39;re not that close at all - even though the stories&#39; genre is the
    same. In fact, if we start critiquing them, the Godfather has an inferior execution
    &#40;what&#39;s up with that forced f?&#41;. At the same time, though The Godfather
    mark is more iconic. &#40;But is that just because the film is such a classic
    that we forgive the less-than-great typography?&#41; <BR> <BR>Trigger Man is just
    plain, inexcusable muck. It doesn&#39;t deserve to be called parody or even homage.
    &#40;Not that anybody here was calling it that.&#41;'

  body: Whaaaa? &#40;Moe style pronounciation&#41; I don&#39;t get this? What&#39;s
    this about us/them being the bad guys? It&#39;s clear that &#39;trigger man&#39;
    is a bad thing, And I don&#39;t just mean typographically. I mean, look at it.
    The name itself screams &#39;Buy something else&#39;. I agree with Joe about the
    design of &#39;The Sopranos&#39; not being an derivitive of &#39;The Godfather&#39;
    although it may be inspired by it. The name however is clearly meant to echo The
    Godfather, but I don&#39;t have a problem with that at all because it&#39;s merely
    establishing the mob setting. Sorry for any bad spelling and such, I&#39;m a bit
    drunk as I write this.
