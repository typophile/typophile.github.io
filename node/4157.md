  body: Deleting double posts is one of the reasons I&#39;m allowed to hang out here
    ... ;^&#41; <BR> <BR>No need to apologize. In fact, the best thing you can do
    when you double post is edit the second &#40;third, fourth ... tenth&#41; double
    post and replace all of the text with &#34;x2&#34;. That makes it a lot easier
    &#40;more noticeable for me.&#41; <BR> <BR>:^&#41;

  body: I actually tried editing my posts &#40;though I didn&#39;t really know what
    I would have done with it, probably look for a &#34;delete&#34; button&#41; but
    the site said i wasn&#39;t logged in as emilie, although it said &#34;Welcome,
    emilie&#34; on top of my screen....... Go figure ;-&#41;

  body: What I do is wait like 10 seconds after sending a post and then refresh. <BR>
    <BR>If it doesn&#39;t show up immediately try refreshing again in a couple minutes,
    and if not then, try posting again. <BR> <BR>I stop the errors before I get a
    chance to get them.
