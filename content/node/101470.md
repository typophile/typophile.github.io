  fonts are assuming a marginal role in typography and are mainly used for emphasising
  purposes. Filippo Salmina from FSdesign believes they deserve more and pursuits
  a personal philosophy in the development of italic fonts.  \r\n\r\n\u201CStile\u201D,
  the new font family, has been developed particularly for being used as copy font.
  While common italics with an angle of approximately 8 degrees while reading make
  your eyes quickly exhausted, \u201CStile\u201D preserves them from fatigue. Due
  to its moderate inclination it is easily readable, really flexible and universally
  applicable. The cursive character of \u201CStile\u201D has more to do with writing-speed
  than to its (moderate) inclination and is responsible also for its particularly
  homogenous text colour.\r\n\r\n\u201CStile\u201D is a true cursive and not a simple
  slanted version of an upright font like for the most part of the font families of
  the competitors.\r\n\r\nA dedicated website has just been set up in order to highlight
  the potential of italic fonts. Stile and other true cursives are available there
  free of charge for testing purposes:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.italicfonts.com/typophile_index.htm|www.italicfonts.com]]\r\n
