  Organizing Committee members invite you to contribute your \r\nproposals for a presentation
  or panel discussion for inclusion in the \r\nprogramme of the 4th ICTVC.\r\nAbstracts
  of no more than 200 words and a short bio of 70-100 words, \r\neither in Greek or
  English, should be submitted by 10 January 2010.\r\nConference presentations should
  be up to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis time ICTVC is organized in collaboration with the
  Mass Media and \r\nCommunication Institute (IMME), Cyprus, and AlterVision, Greece,
  and \r\nis supported by the Department of Typography & Graphic Communication \r\nat
  the University of Reading (UK), the Association Typographique \r\nInternationale
  (ATypI), the Greek Graphic Designers Association (EGE)\r\nand the Thessaloniki Design
  Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information about the 4th ICTVC you may contact:\r\nDr
