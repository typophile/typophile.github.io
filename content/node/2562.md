  body: Looks pretty similar to <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?image=FBT0600026"
    target="_blank">FB Herald Gothic</a> that has been smoothed at the corners. If
    you type &#34;StereoLab alumInum TuneS&#34; in their &#39;flont&#39; test drive
    you get the letterforms like the sample.

  body: Hmm... The proportions look wrong. Also, smoothening  <BR>the corners wouldn&#39;t
    get you there, as they are cut off  <BR>at 45

    tho.

  body: It looks to me like the kind of thing that could be very easily done from
    scratch -- also, allowing how old that sample probably is, even if it is a typeface
    it may not be available in digital form. But trust me, about an hour spent with
    Illustrator and Dimensions, and you could replicate this precisely. &#40;Much
    to the chagrin of the original designer, who probably spent days working on it...&#41;

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> It&#39;s supposed to have been  <BR>incorporated in Adobe
    Illustrator CS innit? I can&#39;t wait to  <BR>try it out.

  body: Yves, it is somewhat. But 3DSMAX, still is a better solution ;&#41;

  body: Yves indeed Adobe Dimensions is incorporated into Illustrator CS. I hope LiveMotion
    gets incorportated into GoLive&#39;s next release.
