body: Whats the term for the part of a curve, like an "o" that extends ever-so-slightly
  below the baseline and above the meanline?

    body: "I found it.\r\n\r\nIt's called an \"[[overshoot]]\"\r\n\r\nTypically 3%x
      on a curve(o), 5%x on a point(A).\r\n\r\nI came across it a few days ago, but
      forgot where."

    body: No, I think thats just an average. The overshoot will vary depending on
      the font. It's a descision made by the type designer.

    point than a standard x-height %. '

  body: "The overshoot needs to be a bit more for very \"round\", narrow curves and
    less for flatter ones, like the O in Eurostile or the C in Thesis. \r\n\r\nIt
    helps me not to think in terms of the depth/height but the width of the extending
    portion: If you make the overshoot so big that is has about one third of the width
    of the O you are probably right."
