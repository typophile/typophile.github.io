  in a couple weeks and wanted to see if anyone that lives there, or has visited before,
  had any suggestions for some must see spots, specifically anything design related.\r\n\r\nLooks
  like there is a AIGA Seattle-Moscow Poster Show running while I will be there, going
  to be checking that out. Any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Pike Place Market has a quirky little used-books/magazines/ephemera store
    that might be worth a visit. The local art galleries near there can also be worth
    a visit, if nothing else than for a creative recharge. You might also want to
    check out the Seattle Daniel Smith art store (the original Daniel Smith store
    I believe) if you're looking to pick up quality art/design supplies (pens, inks,
    paints, awesome papers, book-binding material, etc). Experience Music Project
    if you're into that. University Of Washington has some beautiful architecture
    (and artwork too).\r\n\r\nThis is starting to make me homesick..."

    Pike Place Market you''ll find it - I know it''s down on the 2nd or third floor,
    tucked away in the interior somewhere. '

    had a Geoff McFetridge installation. But I think it is down now. Nevertheless,
    you can see a large red ampersand spinning on a post.\r\n\r\nA bookstore with
    a nice breakfast place nearby: http://petermiller.com/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ampersand_wind_5514.jpg]"

    - note the closure dates :-( \r\n\r\nThe Underground Tour is well worth doing,
    as is a ferry ride to Bainbridge Island, some good eats in Fremont (where Adobe's
    Seattle office is located) and my neck of the woods Columbia City, which is on
    the new light-rail line.\r\n \r\n"
