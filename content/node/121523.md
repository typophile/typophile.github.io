  body: "Interesting. If I was going to use a font to recreate the logo I would start
    with Mark Simonson's Coquette Bold. Edit the _o_; using a horizontal mirrored
    lhs to combine with the existing lhs, and thereby create a new _o_ without the
    loop. Use the result as the basis for the new _c_ and _a_. Extend tails of all
    letters and reduce spacing so there is overlap. Trim top and cross bar of _t_.
    Reduce size of dot on _i_. Should be pretty close.\r\nDon"
