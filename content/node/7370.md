    it ... I found a Mecanorma catalog via <BR>bookfinder ... crossing my fingers.

  body: Not in Mecanorma, either, BJ. Sorry not to mention this sooner. Not that the
    MN catalog is a bad thing to have around, though. I checked Zipatone, too. There
    are some real oddballs in that one.

  body: 'Hmm...  <BR> <BR>A few more rub-down type catalogs to be on the lookout for:
    <BR> <BR>Artype <BR>Arttec <BR>Formatt &#60;--good one <BR>Prestype &#40;very
    low end--first I ever used&#41; <BR>Transfertech &#40;beware--lots of pirated
    stuff in this one from Headliners, Alphabet Innovations, ITC, VGC, and others&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Other headline font sources: <BR> <BR>VGC <BR>TypeSettra &#40;from Canada&#41;
    <BR>Alphabet Innovations <BR>WTC &#40;founded by some former ITC people&#41; <BR>TypeSpectra
    <BR>LetterGraphics &#40;although much of their library was pirated stuff&#41;
    <BR>Type Films of Chicago &#40;almost all pirated stuff&#41; <BR> <BR>Catalogs
    from display typesetting houses are good too. These varied from city to city and
    contained fonts from one or more of the above sources. <BR> <BR>Some defunct phototypesetting
    machine manufacturers which may have catalogs worth looking at: <BR> <BR>AM/Varityper
    <BR>Compugraphic <BR>Alphatype <BR>H. Berthold &#60;--these are beauties <BR>Photon
