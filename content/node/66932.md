  My favorite serif typefaces are up to now Albertina and FF Scala.\r\nI\u2019m looking
  for a sans serif typeface that works well as a headline-font  with Albertina and
  Scala. The aim is to set scientific texts. But the typeface ought to work well for
  body text, too.\r\n\r\nMy search led me to FF Kievit\u2014a wonderful clear and
  neutral typeface. Now I\u2019m looking for a typeface that is as clear and neutral
  as Kievit is, but that has other proportions (when this is the right word for it)\u2014something
  like DTL Documenta Sans (has unfortunately only one weight), Scala Sans (in my opinion
  not as clear and neutral as Kievit, but with a wonderful italic like Auto 1 italic
  (by Underware), or DTL Caspari.\r\n\r\nDTL Caspari fits my image well, but I don\u2019t
  like some of the details, namely relating to the baseline nonparallel endings of
  the strokes of some charecters (e.g. \xBBA\xAB, \xBBK\xAB, \xBBV\xAB, \xBBW\xAB,
  \xBBY\xAB, \xBBY\xAB, \xBBk\xAB, \xBBv\xAB, \u2026, \xBBy\xAB). I guess I\u2019m
  looking for something like Kievit with a smaller x-height respectively taller extender
  length.\r\n\r\nThank you for recommendations!\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nMario\r\n"

  body: "Most of Martin Majoor's typefaces clearly show his own style, and are sometimes
    quite similar, but remarkably different in its details and execution. So maybe
    you can try another one of his typefaces, like [[http://www.martinmajoor.com/4_nexus.html|FF
    Nexus]], that also has a sans companion, for example. \r\n\r\nAnd I can vouch
    for FF Kievit. I own a license for it and use it quite extensively, mostly for
    extended text settings. Actually, I've set whole books with it. The same goes
    for FF Milo, which is somewhat alike Kievit and works equally well, but it has
    more quirky features. FF Milo was recently expanded with its own companion serif.
    A really nice one I might add. :)"

    Taller extenders and various weights for headlines."

  body: "I like the sans serifs from Martin Majoor, but not for my purposes (as a
    headline typeface for scientific texts). In my opinion they have too much character
    or better: show too much of it in taller sizes and so call the readers attention
    to themselves, but not to the message.\r\n\r\nat Weltin: Thank you for your remark.
    Agilita is a really nice typeface. It comes close to what I\u2019m looking for
    and suffers\u2014in comparison to Kievit\u2014 only the loss of a bit of clarity.
    It could be an alternative."

  body: "I\u2019ve had a closer look at Agilita\u2014it is really nice, but it is
    disqualified for my purposes, I think, because of the appreciable modulation in
    the line width. I\u2019m looking for a typeface that is as clear and neutral as
    possible.\r\n\r\nat Quincunx: Have you already combined Kievit with Albertina,
    Minion or Scala? Will it work?\r\n\r\nOr has anybody futher suggestions?"

    it will work fine.
