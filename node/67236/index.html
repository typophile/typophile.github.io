They mentioned that something similar would be ok, so I&rsquo;m scratching to find something that would suit them (think personal trainer who uses yoga in her practice and likes tribal design) and not make me feel professional pain.  I would love to hear some suggestions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also love to hear how others tactfully deal with clients that want to use fonts (or other design elements) that you just can&rsquo;t bring yourself to use?  How do you tell them that their choices are&hellip; less than ideal?</p>

In a perfect world, it would work every time, but some clients won&rsquo;t budge and then you also need to learn to let things go.</p>
<p>As for the client who wants Papyrus, try explaining to them how overused Papyrus is and how you want to help them be more distinctive that every other fitness/yoga/tribal brand. Maybe she&rsquo;ll understand and at least you tried.</p>

Now, there is one (to wit, poorly executed and, I believe, free) font on the Net, called Samarkand, to give you an idea of what I’m talking about. True, it would take some, and, depending on the quantity of text, possibly quite some work to do the job. But, then again, it could be fun, and quite an experience, to execute it, I’d say.</div>

<p>Explain to the client that their wishes will be respected, but that it would be poor form on my part if I didn&rsquo;t talk a little about Papyrus.  Tell them that it has a low value perception etc., and that holistic health practices do not have to equal hand hewn, scratchy or ethnic typeface styles.  What I think of when I think of their practice is: clarity, strength, flexibility (arcs and curves), leanness and light.  I&rsquo;ll then show them good examples of design for such studios and bad design using Papyrus. Then give them examples of their logo with Papyrus and with the typefaces I will choose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask them to think about it for a few days before deciding and if, in the end, they still want Papyrus, then I&rsquo;ll do that for them.</p>
<p>EDIT: Adding this comment from a friend, because it&rsquo;s funny: &lsquo;&hellip;letting her know
that you would use it if required helps.  Too bad you can&rsquo;t mention that
&ldquo;If you do force me to use it, I will never be able to admit performing
this service for you, and would have to take my name off of all documents
associated with your design package.&quot;&rsquo;</p>

The problem is that it&rsquo;s a face used by a lot of amateurs, and it looks damn good in their hands.
It&rsquo;s embarrassing for professionals to put themselves on a par with amateurs by using it.
It&rsquo;s common, or &ldquo;naff&rdquo; as the Brits say these days.
And it&rsquo;s not as if you can get designy or ironic with it, as is sometimes possible with Comic Sans.
Another thing, it&rsquo;s a very demonstrative &ldquo;display&rdquo; face, the design of which tends to overshadow the typographer&rsquo;s contribution, which is the main reason that designers avoid new and novelty faces.</p>
<p>Compounding the problem is the fact that there are no adequate recherché substitutes.
Stewf&rsquo;s list demonstrates that. 
Like Trajan, Papyrus is a well-proportioned and distinctive face with a lot of nicely rendered microdetail, so that it renders well at different sizes and in different environments.
So until someone comes up with another face which can match its qualities, tough.</p>

I&rsquo;m the dreaded client. I was surprised and hurt when my brand was looked at by a newly released designer( just graduated design school) and she gasped. You should never ever ever use papyrus.  I ran to the Internet and typed in &ldquo;why you should never use papyrus font&rdquo;. I was bombarded by reasons. My heart sank. I had already passed out business cards and menus. I had received so very many compliments on the simplicity and style of my logo. Most every woman that saw the design, loved it. Is that because we are ingrates lacking the ability to see &ldquo;tacky&rdquo; overused fonts. A sub human group, without education. 
Mainstream: is the problem that we are flowing with it, or just don&rsquo;t care and are rebelling with the quiet but blatant use of papyrus wherever possible? 
I must attend design school, or never again take matters into my own hands, otherwise, I might drink tea, rather than sip it.</div>

<p>Yes, that is important. But this thread addresses the &ldquo;professional pain&rdquo; that Papyrus causes.
So I think I can be forgiven for not wandering off topic, although not, apparently, for being an artist.</p>
<p>[Papyrus] <em>is in-your-face. Designers who use Gotham are -hopefully- shooting for subtlety&hellip;</em></p>
<p>This is a slightly different idea than what I had mentioned earlier, &ldquo;&hellip;[Papyrus is] a very demonstrative &ldquo;display&rdquo; face, the design of which tends to overshadow the typographer&rsquo;s contribution&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To develop on that: Gotham is a face that can be used to produce strong contemporary multi-line settings (e.g. tightly leaded all caps) that give typographic structure to a layout, whereas Papyrus tends to float, its effectiveness coming from its display-lettering qualities, i.e. the hand-made, textured finish of its letter forms.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow.  That&rsquo;s a lot to respond to&hellip;</p>
<p>Everyone will have their own idea as to what works and what doesn&rsquo;t and I think all the above opinions are valid for the person who wrote them&hellip; not necessarily for me, but I find all opinions valuable in one way or another, if for nothing else than to clarify my own thoughts.</p>
<p>That fact that Papyrus is often used by the lay-person is not it&rsquo;s only problem, but this does reflect poorly when used poorly and there are a lot of instances where that happens.  I don&rsquo;t often see it used well, as has been suggested.  This leads to a wider low opinion of businesses that use this font and so of course I don&rsquo;t want my clients or my work in that kind of company.  To steal a phrase from hrant: &ldquo;Fonts don&rsquo;t work in a vacuum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As to it being commonly reviled being due to the fact that it&rsquo;s commonly used:  There are fonts that have been around longer and are used more often that I have zero problem with. Helvetica, although much maligned by some (i think it&rsquo;s the boredom factor), is a well-designed font.</p>
<p>Papyrus, as Nick says, is a novelty font.  There&rsquo;s a reason it is in the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; collection in Font Book.  It&rsquo;s very gimmicky looking and just far too literal. It doesn&rsquo;t belong in anyone&rsquo;s visual/corporate ID or branding, in my opinion&hellip; unless it&rsquo;s theme or feel appropriate, say a spa that using Egyptian Threading as one of it&rsquo;s services or Chinese massage&hellip; or a child&rsquo;s class project on South East Asia.</p>
<p>I also believe it is inherently flawed, although put this down to personal preference if you like.  It&rsquo;s descenders are different lengths, ascenders are even, but too tall.  This lack of consistency in appearance does actually make it break down at small sizes and in certain mediums.  The chips out of it don&rsquo;t help either, although I wouldn&rsquo;t say they were aggressive and could work on other type-faces, but taking an idea to farcical extremes never did it any favours in terms of concept.  I&rsquo;ll say one thing in it&rsquo;s favour.  It has generous counter-spaces.  I like that.  I think it&rsquo;s one of it&rsquo;s saving graces.</p>
<p>My response to Papyrus has nothing to do with the prevailing design brain.  This is for branding purposes, not a movie poster.  I can guarantee you that my client doesn&rsquo;t perceive her business as a novelty.  I didn&rsquo;t actually realise how much hate their was for it until I was asked to use it and thought: &ldquo;You must be kidding.&rdquo; and started looking around for ways I could express this to my client without causing offence.</p>
<p>Don:  Thanks for the suggestion.  I did consider Elli actually, but the client loves flow and I think Elli might be a little too sharp and I would prefer to use something more regular for type that will be used with a logo for better reproduction at small sizes in a variety of media.</p>
<p>Typodermic and xo: Heh.</p>

<p>I think that Papyrus is overused because, among the well-known and widely available typefaces, it does what it does better than any of the others.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick &amp; quadibloc, I understand the stance but have to voice a little disagreement on this one. The merits or demerits of the typeface&rsquo;s aesthetic characteristics aside, the ubiquity  of papyrus can&rsquo;t possibly stem from the fine-tuned tastes of the world&rsquo;s tweeners personalizing their diary blogs&hellip;the face was obviously meant to project a specific communicative intent—ancient, foreign, egyptian, crumbling scroll, etc.,—but there are few applications I can think of that would make good use of what this typeface says visually&hellip;(maybe the Stargate franchise?) (Also, is it odd to admit typefaces speak to me?)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be hard to deny papyrus is overused and abused as by everybody with a computer who can call it up among their twenty or so pre-installed fonts. When I see it in the world, I find it&rsquo;s almost always a lazy shorthand attempt to communicate &ldquo;creative&rdquo; or &ldquo;funky&rdquo; or &ldquo;tweener diary&rdquo; or &ldquo;yoga&rdquo; or &ldquo;sci-fi movie&rdquo; or &ldquo;organic aisle&rdquo; or &ldquo;candles by Jan&rdquo; or &ldquo;asian restaurant&rdquo; or &ldquo;bong shop&rdquo; or &ldquo;tattoo parlor&rdquo; or &ldquo;office party memo&rdquo; or &ldquo;gardening supplies&rdquo; and on and on and on</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what honestly gets my goat about this one: Papyrus speaks, and speaks loudly—but what it says, is &ldquo;I&rsquo;m funky and creative and unique&rdquo; in a way that is so painfully common, comfortable, familiar, underwhelming, thoughtless, default, a little bit ugly, and herd-instinct-approved. It&rsquo;s like the PT Cruiser of typefaces&hellip;</p>

<p>Nick: I love your feedback. It&rsquo;s thoughtful, sane, and good for my professional growth.  I agree that some of her clients would feel a certain kinship because of that font, but they are not her only target market (nor are they her primary target market) and that is not the only thing they would respond positively to.  I also believe that people are capable of knowing cheap when they see it, designer or not.  So that association will be there for a lot of people, not just myself or other designers.  Designers are probably just more conscious of it.</p>
<p>Paul:  As you see above, I don&rsquo;t think it is a gift bestowed only on designers that they can see &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; at fifty paces.  If it was then you&rsquo;d agree with me, right? ;)</p>

<p>according to you your client has really cheap taste. Are you sure you want the job?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She has her own associations with this typeface. It&rsquo;s not about thinking she has cheap taste, it&rsquo;s about understanding the wider implications of using this font that have been outlined by many of us.  Many non-designers live their lives without even considering the nature of the design they are subjected to on a daily basis.  It&rsquo;s like The Matrix, but with typefaces!  You should know that she does understand my reasoning, appreciates my honesty and looks forward to seeing alternative ways of expressing the core values of her business.  I look forward to her choosing the red pill.*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not understand font hatred, it feels very elitist to me.
This is not mindless, elitist font hate.  It&rsquo;s thoughtful, better design for the people font aversion. ;)  Is it elitist to not want to use a font when you have outlined good reasons for it? Instinctual and practical dislike for a font is not elitism, it is personal preference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5star and tylerh:  The talk went well. There&rsquo;s always room for tact, but I definitely agree in that I think it&rsquo;s negligent to not steer clients away from making bad choices.</p>
<p>*Apologies to those unfamiliar with The Matrix.</p>

<p>What is the difference between elitism and serving one&rsquo;s client as best one can? Obviously, it&rsquo;s motive: is it &ldquo;my fellow typographers will laugh at me&rdquo;, or &ldquo;your potential customers will laugh at you&rdquo;?</p>
<p>People who aren&rsquo;t typographers will notice they&rsquo;ve seen Papyrus before at this New Age bookstore or that yoga center or the other T-shirt store or restaurant and so on. Having a unique and original typographic identity is a good thing that ordinary people appreciate. So it is perfectly legitimate to look for an alternative to Papyrus.</p>
<p>The problem may be finding one. There are several - there have been threads here discussing this issue before in which many candidates were presented - but since none of them communicates the same thing in the same way as Papyrus, which alternative is suitable would have to be carefully chosen. Thus, for example, in some cases, one could use Ondine (also fairly widely used, though) instead of Papyrus, and in others it would be a very bad choice for a replacement.</p>
<p>I mentioned Tuff: going in a different direction, one could consider Present.</p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re not talking about history - we&rsquo;re talking about what a client needs now. In fact it&rsquo;s hard enough getting people to realize the power and relevance of fonts right in front of their eyes - you want them to become sensitive to their <em>history</em> as well?  :-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s motive: is it &ldquo;my fellow typographers will laugh at me&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;your potential customers will laugh at you&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Certainly the first one shouldn&rsquo;t be at play (except possibly as a desperate ruse to let the design be more than the client will allow). But the second one is extremely relevant.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are two contradictory principles at work here.</p>
<p>Firstly, a typeface is one of many tools that a designer uses to create a page, an identity, a signage system, whatever.
So fixating on Papyrus is not conducive to the synergy of a good design, and constrains originality and the development of something custom tailored to the client.</p>
<p>Secondly, it&rsquo;s unavoidable that when &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; has a computer and a font as distinctive as Papyrus is bundled with Apple, Microsoft, and Corel, there is going to be consumer awareness of this professional tool&ndash;and a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Papyrus certainly picked up a lot of good karma being used for the captioning in Avatar. Damn, it&rsquo;s so easy to recognize with its humunguous extenders. What other typefaces are like that? Delphin is all I can think of.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a real challenge for designers to deal with their clients' font-specific prosumer tastes, especially when these tastes are shared by the target market.</p>
<p>Why not develop two treatments, one of which uses Papyrus, and market test them?
After all, it&rsquo;s just a tool&ndash;surely there must be some way for a designer to put her stamp on it and use it in a subtle and creative way? (Easy for me to say!)</p>

<p>But that very strength has two problems: 1. It makes them less flexible, and less easy to harmonize with other design elements and 2. It also can make them go stale more quickly.</p>
<p>I think these two factors mean that the highly flavored face needs to really work graphically for the use, if it is not to go stale for those who use the shop or services.</p>

<p>Papyrus is also included with the large selection of Bitstream fonts included with either Corel Draw or Word Perfect, and the latter is sometimes included along with the purchase of a new Windows PC. So a lot of people with Windows machines also have this face without having to have purchased it directly from the typefounder at a higher price.</p>

So, dear Suzanne, why don’t you just make those few letters yourself? That way you can’t go wrong, you’ll be definitely gratified; and the client… well, we’ll see.

<p>A Sanskrit simulation font, however, would say &ldquo;tacky&rdquo; in a voice far clearer than Papyrus, at least in my opinion. Ondine is not advisable for the same reason.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll certainly agree that Yoga is not particularly Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.</p>
<p>It is, however, very Indian, and India is part of the Far East. It certainly isn&rsquo;t part of the Middle East.</p>

<p>I now have several fonts up my sleeve that represent the ideas that the client wants to communicate without being overly literate or simplistic.  None are Asian themed, nor do they need to be as it&rsquo;s not pertinent the business.  All have flow or are rounded, have curves, have a regular and solid structure and are on the light side, reflecting principles of her business (personal trainer who uses a mix of skills including her chiropractic licence and yoga).</p>
<p>Thanks all.</p>

<p>Anyway, you need to understand you won&rsquo;t get much sympathy on this forum. Far too many of the denizens of Typophile are more involved with style than design, which lets in a lot of us-versus-them thinking. &ldquo;Style&rdquo; is also very much of the moment &ndash; like which of the 10,451 sans serif fonts birthed in 2012 should one use? It&rsquo;s understood those fonts are not to be used in 2013, of course. And probably not in Des Moines, ever.</p>

<p>Indeed, although compared to the broader field of design (such as clothing bought by the typical yoga student) we&rsquo;re quite ascetic, especially those of us who prefer making text fonts.</p>
<p>However disposing of style entirely results in typography that&rsquo;s entirely disposable.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;style&rdquo; is commonly used where referring to design trends, I use it myself all the time, but actually I think what we&rsquo;re talking about here is more in the realm of fashion rather than style.</p>
<p>An example of the difference is if you looked at photo of a person taken in 1870, you&rsquo;d probably have no idea if the clothes they were wearing were in fashion that year, but you could instantly tell if that person had style.</p>
<p>Same thing with design. Just because a font or a design element is out of fashion (due to overuse, for example) doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it&rsquo;s got bad style. Helvetica, for example, is a good font, but it&rsquo;s out of fashion at the moment.</p>

I guess it depends on whether what’s fashionable falls within the purview of sales statistics or pundits, in which case I wouldn’t pick you for a maven, Charles!</p>
<p>As you note (“10,451 sans serif fonts birthed in 2012”), it’s serifs—other than slabs—that are out of fashion, a fact borne out by the said MyFonts chart.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good point, Nick.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure that a high ranking necessarily means that designers regard it as fashionable. Designers who do corporate work need Helvetica in their collection even if they don&rsquo;t particularly like it, plus a lot of sales are undoubtedly to non-designers.</p>

To me, it means what’s not popular—and popularity can be measured by font sales.
If you think it means despised and/or ignored by hip designers, that’s something else again, and dependent on how one deﬁnes both “designers” and “hip”.
Punditry is all very well, but what are your qualiﬁcations, what makes you an expert on font fashions?
Frankly James, you and I have no idea at all who is licensing Helvetica at MyFonts and why, only conjecture.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, what I was trying to say is that popularity of fonts as measured by sales doesn&rsquo;t necessarily reflect what&rsquo;s &ldquo;in fashion&rdquo; to professional designers, since pros probably make up only a minority of their customers, and many sales of Helvetica to pros are because it&rsquo;s a font they need rather than one they&rsquo;d prefer to use.</p>
<p>Just as the best-selling shirt in the U.S. probably isn&rsquo;t the shirt that a fashion designer would buy, or the best-selling couch probably isn&rsquo;t the one an interior designer would buy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got nothing against Helvetica, I use it all the time. But my sense is that most pros tend to stay away from it due to overuse and its association with work done a few decades ago.</p>
<p>I agree with you that this is conjecture.</p>
