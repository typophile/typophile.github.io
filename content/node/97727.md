  to take a look at the video: http://j.mp/k5KA95\r\n\r\nMy Forum favourite last month
  was pictures of a Linograph machine at the University of Iowa. Nice to see pictures
  of this rare machine. Click the link below to take a look at the article:\r\nhttp://www.metaltype.co.uk/rail/clicks/click.php?id=12\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
  on Sunday October 28 the site suffered a security breach. Apologies if anyone received
  emails from the site's Classified Ads software on that date. As a consequence of
  the security breach I have had to replace the site's Classified Ads software. I
  was unable to carry ads over to the new system. The good news is that the new software
  has some new features (you are able to include, links, pictures, etc, in your ad)
  and is a lot more user-friendly than the old software. I would be grateful if you
  could re-post your ads on the new system. Perhaps you would like to advertise your
  services on the new site. Ads remain on the site for a full year, unless you choose
  to remove them yourself, and are free. Click the link to take a look:\r\nhttp://www.metaltype.co.uk/market2\r\n\r\nAll
