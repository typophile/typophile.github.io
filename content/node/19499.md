body: Okay, can anyone ID the interlocking "NY" in the NY Mets logo? I'm also looking
  for a font called Henley Script? It resembles "Stephanie Marie", but less weight
  and lean...

  body: The interlocking NY from the Mets uniform was from the 1960s (taken from the
    original NY Giants baseball team)...I was assuming somebody has taken the initiative
    since the 60s to turn it into a font.
