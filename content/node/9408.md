  body: The closest I can suggest is TheSans Black from <a href="http://www.lucasfonts.com/"
    target="_blank">LucasFonts</a>. The G is not quite so closed, but would be a simple
    modification.

  body: <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=413944" target="_blank">Corpid
    Black</a> from FontFabrik at Fonts.com is also somewhat similar. Don&#39;t like
    that Fonts.com doesn&#39;t tell you the designer. Price is a bit steep too, unless
    there are multiple faces in the font.

  body: Seems that FontFabrik is Luc&#40;as&#41; De Groot&#39;s company too. Here
    is a sample of Corpid Black Caps. Could the SC lower case letters be even closer
    to the sample? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66014.gif"

  body: You can mimic the face &#40;if you only need de logo&#41; using Futura and
    Kabel &#40;for the _G_&#41;, slightly condensed and edited. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/futura-nd/bold/testdrive.html?s=SMOG-HOG&amp;p=72"
