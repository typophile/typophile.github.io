    Friend is currently on tour with Kylie in the backing Band.  He's on trumpet in

  body: "That looks very much drawn from scratch.\r\n\r\n*off topic*\r\n\r\nI saw
    Kylie live last tuesday here in istanbul. the crowd was rude (as always here)
    and not very much responsive. the concert place was crappy, very small, she had
    to do the \"small\" show and skip some pretty good songs. too bad... but at least
    i saw the show.\r\n\r\nsay hi to you friend...\r\n\r\n*/off topic*\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "Well from those pics it def seems 'hand drawn' as opposed to a font, sorry.\r\n\r\nI'll
    ask my mate about the Instanbul gig when he finishes the tour.  I'm sure he'll
    have plenty of 'stories' to tell me when he gets back.  Here's his myspace page;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myspace.com/graemeflowers\r\n\r\nJH\r\n\r\nDamn
    I'm jealous! "
