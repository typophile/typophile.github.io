body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for a good
  menu typeface? It'd be no more than two pages; no abnormal glyphs necessary. It'll
  probably be set in 14 pt, with a leading perhaps a hair larger than standard (assuming
  standard is something like 14/16). It's a fine dining restaurant, with an Italian
  cuisine bias.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a serif that isn't boring, but at the same
  time, something where the vertical and horizontal strokes are predictable enough
  so as not to be distracting to the reader. \r\n\r\nJust to give you some more ideas:
  When set in Minion Pro, I was pleased with the small letter width (in comparison
  to Times or Sabon, which I set for comparison), as well as the cleanliness, almost
  \"friendliness\" of the font. I wasn't a fan of the contrast between the thicks
  and the thins.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I also took a look at the menu set in exljbris'
  Fontin typeface. It was a little too idiosyncratic for my tastes, but the strength
  of each letter form on the page was very assertive and I was wondering if there
  was something similar though not as humanist (assuming I'm even using that work
  correctly.)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "14pt is HUGE. I wouldn't set anything larger than 12, as an absolute limit,
    if I'm trying to go for a fine-dining feel.\r\n\r\nYour criteria are still very
    general. Are you looking for something that's bundled? If you're looking for low
    contrast, you could try Chaparral, but that's still pretty humanist."

  body: "I don't have too much experience in fine dining restaurants, but some have
    dim lighting, almost like candle light. Test your design in the restaurant after
    dark. \r\n\r\nThere is a trade-off. If you want a font that's not so thin, it
    will probably be a little wider; more ink gets put on the paper.\r\n\r\nThere
    is another trade-off. A font like Minion may look more\r\n\"sophisticated\" than
    a low contrast font like Chaparral. And I say that as a big fan of Chaparral.
    If you have to choose between sophistication and readability...\r\n\r\nAgain,
    I haven't seen too many fine-dining menus. But I think the diners appreciate a
    easy-to-read menu at the ambient lighting.\r\n\r\nJ. Tillman"

  body: "Hey everyone, thanks for your comment.\r\n\r\n@DrDoc\r\n12 pt it is then;
    14pt was a shot in the dark. I was looking at the menu I had in my hand and guessed.\r\n\r\nTo
    specify even further: I guess what I'm looking for, in a sentence: Is there a
    superb body typeface that any well standing typographer could look at and say:
    \"This is a body typeface not meant for any book.\" I don't know if such a thing
    exists!\r\n\r\n@JamesM\r\nThere is no brand consistency. The logo is set in Times
    with a vertical stretching of the first letters.  It's decent, but if we look
    to it to set the standard, we aren't getting very far. Times is set, throughout.
    \r\n\r\n@Tillman\r\nThe lighting is very dark, but you bring a good point. Thank
    you."

    himself. :)\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nJames: Trying to settle on the point size before settling
    on a font is a total shot in the dark, no matter if you say 12 or 14. :-)  Because
    the actual size of the letters, and the question of how large (and how readable)
    they <em>look</em>, is going to vary greatly according to the font you choose.
    14pt doesn't need to be huge, depending on font and application. \r\n\r\nIt seems
    to me a bit like you're trying to find too-precise answers too early. There probably
    isn't going to be The One Precise Perfect Font for this project, but many good
    options and many not-so-good ones. So what you really need now are the right <em>questions</em>.
    What in fact are you looking for? What do you <em>need</em> in a font so that
    it can do this job? \r\nOne very good point is raised by J. Tillman above. Restaurant
    menus are read in the near-dark \u2013 and they're not supposed to frustrate people,
    but tickle their appetite! So you need something that's very clear, and maybe
    actually is a bit bigger than usual, so that it will read pretty much effortlessly.
    \r\nAre there other practical constraints? \r\nAnother question would be aesthetics
    \u2013 how this should feel. Classy? Standard? Expensive? Quick? Leisurely? Luxurious?
    If you can find some more words to describe the feeling you're after, that will
    make the search much easier. Also, where does your idea come from that the horizontals
    and verticals should not be very different? Is this just personal preference,
    or why do you believe it will do the job better?\r\nAnd if you're stuck, just
    go play \u2013 try out some options, and take the printouts to an actual restaurant
    to check. Train your eyes; observe. "

    from portfolio*</em> There is hope!\r\n\r\nWell nina, what I think is best will
    make everyone shrill loudly. But given that the client is a relative (yes... one
    of those jobs <em>*wink*</em>) <strong>free</strong> will work best, even if the
    typeface is stretching it a wee bit. ;\u2013)\r\n\r\nBut, in a perfect world,
    with a little bit of persuasion, something between classy and relaxed. It is indeed
    a fancy restaurant, but located in suburban Connecticut, so the clientele is upper-middle
    class. But they certainly would stick out in a high-end NYC joint (whatever <em>that</em>
    means.) I'm thinking this means proportionality... a serif that doesn't let its
    white space (within each letterform) get too liberal. So our basic Sabon is getting
    close, but still doesn't seem appropriate. \r\n\r\nOr maybe, how about this: if
    you were taking a morning stroll through an Italian vineyard, the type of typography
    you'd <em>want</em> to see on a wooden sign, drenched in shadow from a canopy
    of trees.\r\n\r\nNot garamondial, not a (noticeably) slab serif, nothing too humanist
    (though a tad bit wouldn't hurt...) But I'm not too turned off from Minion, so,
    what I'm thinking:\r\n\r\nIs there a serif from like before the 1900s that looked
    like someone has designed it from the past twenty years?\r\n\r\nVery vague, but
    you all know so much more than I so maybe I'm barking up a tree and just don't
    know it yet. \r\n\r\n"

    Copernicus</a> (a very fresh [IMO] Plantin-based design). Are these anything like
    what you're thinking of?"

    much too swashy with the serifs."
