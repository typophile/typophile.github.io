  tried using the automated font recognition tool at <www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\u200E>
  but the closest match it could find (which was not an exact match) was ITC Weidemann
  Medium.\r\nThe document that I have uploaded is a snippet of a scanned image of
  a document that was printed in 1992, so the font must have been around before then."

    body: Thanks, I think you're right. I will try using Palatino in future instead
      of Times New Roman for body text, it is much more legible on a printed document.
