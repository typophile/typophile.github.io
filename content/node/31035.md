    - this points out another issue I have with Fontshop.com vs. myfonts.com - which
    is that at Fontshop when you search for a font it comes up only in the packages
    available and you kind of have to guess is it FF Meta 1 or FF Meta 2 whereas the
    same search in myfonts lets you view the entire Meta family at once."
