  body: "I think we have had this question several times before, and my recollection
    is that it is a custom version of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/linotype-didot/\">Didot</a>.
    The font <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-alias/perla/\">Perla</a> upper
    case also is quite similar, but the lower case letters of Perla are more unusual
    being the size of the upper case letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
