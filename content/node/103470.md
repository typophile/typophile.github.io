  wanted me to whip up a logo design using this font for his sales team.  I think
  I've identified it as Black-Block Norm, but I wanted to check if there's anything
  closer.  Also, if it's more similar to a font that may already be loaded in word/photoshop,
  or can be downloaded for free?\r\n\r\nThanks so much everyone!"

  body: Not exactly squooshed, the following letters look different /E/F/M/Q/Z but
    you are right that it smells like a copy or at least like they share a common
    origin.
