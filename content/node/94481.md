body: "I drove by these signs multiple times last weekend and I spotted a road-type
  that I hadn't seen before.. I'm really curious to figure out what SS typeface this
  might be: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/42030424@N08/6838884164/\r\n\r\nI
  wish I had taken a shot of the Breckenridge one, as there are more letters to analyze,
  but the lowercase i seems to be the same in the \"Elevation 8,150 ft.\" - so I assume
  it's the same typeface as the display that reads \"Vail\" \r\n\r\ncheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
