		<div class="commentbody">I think the new version was mostly so Insider could split the font-sharing features into a separate, more expensive product. That's fine with me, as I wasn't using the sharing features, but it doesn't really feel like a major upgrade. <BR> <BR>That said, the new overlay window for auto-activation is indeed nice, and the upgrade is transparent. The new filtering capabilities are nice, but the GUI is still pretty sluggish in dealing with large collections, and the text preview capabilities aren't as nice as FontReserve's.  <BR> <BR>I have noticed some oddities: I recently imported a batch of fonts into FontAgent Pro, and it only shows one face from each family in the FAP list, but most of the faces are available in applications (one or two are missing, for reasons I can't fathom). Also, FAP still has some problems with corrupt / old fonts. <BR> <BR>All in all, it's a good incremental upgrade, but nothing amazingly flashy. I'm glad I made the switch to FAP from FontReserve, but font management still has a ways to go on Mac OS X.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To answer your question, Danny, yes, FontAgent Pro still wants to make its own copies of your fonts for its library. That's a pretty key feature of FAP, and one I don't see changing any time soon. <BR> <BR>I have three font folders: one &quot;master&quot; folder, that has all my collated and organized fonts; the FontReserve Library (I used to use FontReserve, but eventually got frustrated with its klunkiness); and the FontAgent Pro library. Until recently, I kept all my fonts in both FontAgent and FontReserve, but I'm about to pull the trigger on that arrangement, both because FAP and FontReserve groan under the weight of 16,754 fonts, and also because the number of fonts I have, period, is about to drop precipitously as I get rid of all the fonts I don't have a documented license for. I've decided it makes more sense, anyway, to only bring fonts into the libraries when I actually need them. <BR> <BR>Unless you're running a print shop, the size of an additional type library isn't going to be that big. I don't see why having an additional copy of your fonts on your hard drive is a problem. These days, all the major font-management programs allow you to set up a client-server structure, and font servers should have big chunks of disk anyway. Why do people object to FAP and FontReserve making copies of their fonts?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer FAP to Extensis but Forrest's mention of over 16,000 fonts has prompted me to inquire if anyone else out there using FAP, is having problems with &quot;corrupted&quot; fonts slowing down (to a near cripple) all of their other programs.  I have tried to load 3,000 to 5000 fonts into FAP, but I am told that when my programs start chugging, it is because of corrupted fonts, and that I must try to isolate the culprit(s) and remove them.  Obviously, that is a near impossiblity to do, and so I have to keep removing  thousands of fonts from FAP until the other programs  get back to normal speed.  The thing is, FAP is supposed to detect the corrupt fonts and not load them.  I know some things are always going to slip by, but I just cannot get FAP to let me operate normally with over approximately 1500 fonts.  <BR> <BR>I do agree that it probably makes more sense to bring fonts in only when I need them, but one gets so busy that it would be nice  to be able to keep 5000 in there for easy access, rather than a periodic, annoying clean up. Anyone have any advice on this?  Thank you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I spent several days consolidating my font collection, starting from a base I'd built inside FontReserve, and then run through FontAgent Pro and Font Doctor. Even after that, I have problems with corruption inside FontAgent Pro all the time. Apparently FAP 3 rewrites the font-checking / font-fixing info, and there's the new &quot;Verify&quot; command to kick out busted fonts, but I think there's just too many ways for fonts to get hosed, especially if they get passed hand to hand for a while. Another case for not using warezed fonts!</div>
