body: Considering the professionalism of the people in here, I suppose I will be shred
  to parts. However, I would like to collect some opinions as well as ideas for improvements.
  <BR> <BR>The company main object is blank CD-R, CD-RW &amp; DVDR discs, and this
  is a trade company, eg they don&#39;t manufacture the CD&#39;s, they just sell them.
  I wanted to stay away from the &#34;euro stars&#34; cliche. Thank you, folks. <BR>

  body: 'I think the lower two signs are not bad, although they could maybe be a little
    more abstract if you ask me. Although I like the font you&#39;ve choosen, I don&#39;t
    think it really fits to the sign.  <BR>Try to fiddle a bit with the sign. Use,
    like hhp also said, the &#39;optical&#39; angle. Have a look here for what they&#39;ve
    done with their logo: <BR><a href="http://www.nob.nl/" target="_blank">http://www.nob.nl/</a>
    <BR> <BR>Try some more. You&#39;re on the right track.  <BR> <BR>'

  body: I actually think the squarish font is a nice fit. <BR>What if you make the
    &#34;O&#34; in &#34;OPTICAL&#34; a disk a leave it at that? <BR> <BR>&#40;And
    &#34;Hrant&#34; is fine.&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'My first reaction: &#34;Hmmm. I like the top version.&#34; <BR> <BR>My second
    reaction: &#34;What if the line which indicated the center piece of the cds &#40;in
    the bottom right version&#41; was the same weight as that pseudo-connecting line?&#34;
    <BR> <BR>I prefer the squat-square typeface too.'

    the same as a curling association logo &#40;forget the name sorry&#41; but they
    have the circles coloured 1 red and 1 blue - otherwise same shape and detail'

    seen IMSFA ED logo. But I&#39;m sure that this certain combination of E &amp;
    D is a bit overused, maybe because it is too obvious <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
