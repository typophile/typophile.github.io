  least I'd never heard about it before (I stumbled on it while searching for \"Garalde\"
  in Google) although I think it has some very worthwhile attributes; like look at
  that \"g\"! And the judicious vertical proportions. It was made by Pierport, and
  that immediately suggests to me that Morison was the cause of its persistent obscurity.
  For one thing, they could have just used that (at most having to make a short-extender
  version) instead of dreaming up Times New Roman! Amazing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I think it was an imitation (with some changes) of Goudy's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-kennerley/">Kennerley</a>.
    I might have read this somewhere, but I can't recall for sure.

  body: "Yes, it was an imitation of Goudy's work, which was beginning to gain some
    popularity in Britain at the time. Horley is a small town near to the Monotype
    works.\r\n\r\n<em>But it\u2019s much less wonky and pokey.</em>\r\n\r\nAs Tobias
    Frere-Jones said of Horley when he and Mike Parker and I were talking about it
    some years ago: it lacks Goudy's 'wandering lumpiness'."

  body: Kennerly seems to hold together better to me. Of course this is based on a
    screen impression. But it seems like the ehe wandering lumps dance nicely.
