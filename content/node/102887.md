  body: 'I''m not a font maker nor a designer at all. But may I ask you this question:
    do you want a font for Simplified Chinese (which is used in mainland China, Malaysia
    and Singapore), or Traditional Chinese (which is used in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan),
    or maybe both?'

    currently leaning towards the Simplified Chinese fonts STHeiti (bundled with Adobe
    CS6) as a body copy and FZYaSong for headings (this was recommended by a Chinese
    work colleague). It certainly is a challenge to get a design I am happy with without
    being able to to read to text I'm laying out!\r\n"
