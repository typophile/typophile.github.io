  body: "So, I guess no one knows?\r\n\r\nIt's a great opportunity to recreate. I
    have a friend that recreated A-Z in vector format (based on all the Bboy crew
    images we could pull together). I was hoping to see what other punctuation marks
    and such existed alongside the letters and numbers.\r\n\r\nI've found similar
    \"Old English\" fonts but none of them are exact (see attached).\r\n\r\nI know
    it was an Iron-on letter but it must or originated somewhere. I just need to find
    the random rare font book it was pulled from or printer (late 70's china town,
    NYC).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CutOldEnglishSet_6317.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gothic_3574.jpg]\r\nthis

    closest I've got so far.

    of searching and not being able to find it, I decided to make it. \r\nIt's very
    basic with a few alt characters and limited punctuation etc. But it's enough to
    reproduce shirt designs or knock out a headline. \r\n\r\nAvailable here [[http://www.bengoetting.com/fonts]]"
