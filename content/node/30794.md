  for beginner designers.  I am participating in the boss group. www.thebossgroup.com\r\nI
  was wondering if anyone has had any experience with the pros and cons of them.  I
  have an interview tommorrow that they got for me and I was just wondering if there
  was anything hidden as a beginner that I don't know about."
