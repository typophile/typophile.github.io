body: Hi typophiles, i&#39;ve been coming to this forum often for over a year, i enjoy
  scrubbing through the various topics an reading the interesting stuff that&#39;s
  usually discussed in here. This is going to be my first post; i have to redesign
  a telephone book for a pocket map and reference guide. In previous editions of this
  telephone book i&#39;ve used Bell Centennial, since it&#39;s a proven face for such
  task, and it has worked well for me. Now for the redesign i would like to try something
  else to obtain a new &#39;fresher&#39; look. <BR>I&#39;ve been thinking about &#39;Amplitude&#39;
  and &#39;Retina&#39; as possibilities for the redesign. What do you think about
  those options? Which other fonts do you typophiles think that would suit a telephone
  book with type around 6pt? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for your feedback.

    book for a pocket map and reference guide. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure I understand.
    <BR>Since this is a highly technical area of type design, the specifications &#40;like
    how narrow/wide the &#34;paragraphs&#34; need to be&#41; will affect font choice.
    Could you please elaborate? <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Generally newspapers typefaces created for small sizes suit telephone book
    needs. <BR> <BR>6pts seems not a very small size.

  body: Agreed, although narrowness is a critical element in phone type while it&#39;s
    optional in news &#40;especially since 6 point is indeed a bit big&#41;. <BR>

  body: In order to obtain any kind of trial license of Retina--although I'd think
    this rarely happens--you'll need to get in contact with the sales office at Hoefler
    & Frere-Jones at (212) 777 6640, ext. 201.
