body: "I really hope I'm putting this in the right place. Feel free to chew me out
  and move it if it's not, sorry!\r\n\r\nI was at a high school journalism conference
  at the University of Texas last weekend, and in the class I was in, we were given
  the opportunity to design a random page. So, the page I designed is one that I've
  had rolling around my head for quite some time; basically it was a feature page
  on student artists. For this, I decided to find a nice, messy, handwriting font
  for the headlines. Now, we were on UT's macs in their journalism room, so I didn't
  have access to the fonts I usually would have sprung for, but I settled on a nice
  font called Handwriting Dakota. When I got home, I started googling around to find
  more out about this font and I couldn't find anything. I don't know where it came
  from, or where I could get it to use again if I wanted.\r\n\r\nI'm going to post
  a sample of it, I'm curious to see what you guys think of it. It's, so far, my favorite
  messy, handwriting font I've been able to find. Are there other ones you guys like
  more? \r\n\r\nHere's a random sample (it's even hard to find samples of it!): http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YISIpG_ed7o/SFqWFrIXO3I/AAAAAAAAAP4/LxrTQaHc0AY/s400/mind-dont-matter.gif\r\n\r\nWhile
  I'm at it, I'm super new, could someone tell my how to embed a photo, instead of
  just posting a link?\r\n\r\nThanks guys :]"

    appropriate place for this (it is meant for asking opinions about one\u2019s own
    designed fonts).\r\nBut you can move it yourself to a better section:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/how-to_3961.png]\r\nAnd
    the you can also embed one or more image(s) (590px max width).\r\n\r\nAs for the
    font, it comes with Mac OS X/iMovie \u201909. It was created by Vletter.com in
    1995 and taken over by Apple in 2001. Browsing through old treads, it turns out
    (thanks Mike Y. :-) it\u2019s available as Fultons Hand: http://www.kandjsupplies.com/text_fonts_handwriting/fultons_hand.html"

    has lots of open type features and alternate characters which makes it feel more
    like it was actually handwritten."

  body: What my google-fu dredged up indicated that Handwriting Dakota comes with
    something called iLife, but since my response to iAnything is avoidance, I do
    not know first-hand.

  body: I do love Suomi Hand, but I'm not sure if I'm the biggest fan of Olicana.
    I feel like some of the letters clash with each other a little bit. But keep 'em
    comin', I like looking at pretty script typefaces.

  body: "Many script fonts is that they don't look \"messy\" at headline size, but
    blobby and autotraced, so not at all like writing blown up.\r\n\r\nSo look for
    something with a lot of \"ink-on-paper\" detail, more so than general style."

  body: "That Dakota font is from the old ClickArt collection called Handwritten Fonts.
    I'm familiar with this collection because my hand printing sample became \"Bowfin\"
    in that collection. There was a company called Signature Font, I think,  that
    turned your printed sample into a font for around $50 back in the mid-1990's and
    they sent some of us letters requesting permission to use our fonts in a collection
    they were compiling for Click Art. As our payment, we got a free copy of the font
    CD when it was released.\r\n\r\nAs  far as I know, besides Dakota being used by
    Apple, the collection is still available embedded with other ClickArt collections
    that are sold by Broderbund. \r\n\r\nThe 'alias names' were from a WSi collection
    that had copied and renamed the ClickArt fonts. They distributed their renamed
    copies to other vendors to sell, until eventually I think they were told to cease
    and desist using fonts that were not their own. I'd like to think I was one of
    the people who blew the whistle on them, because Precision Type was starting to
    offer the renamed collection by WSi and I wrote to Precision Type and explained
    the history. They were immediately withdrawn from sale.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
