    copy.jpg]\r\nGreat spot Dav, although there's something about the slope across
    the middle of the \"s\" that isn't quite the same as DIN.\r\n\r\nsgspenser, if
    all you're after is the logo, Google Advanced Search will find you pages from
    their 2005 catalogue with vectors of the logo.\r\n\r\nRichard"

  body: "Yeah, I realised it was very DIN-like, but given, as you say Richard, the
    differences in characters including the 's', I wondered whether it was some special/official
    modification.\r\nI quite like the way they've softened DIN up, but the way they've
    thinned the strokes on the top-left and bottom-right of a lot of characters just
    looks nasty.\r\n\r\nStephen"

    for the help anyway!"

  body: "I am not so sure that this even started out as DIN, although I admit it would
    be a pretty good way to fudge it, if you just wanted a resemblance. I looked at
    ITC Conduit, based on Yves' principle about DIN 'not-quites', but it is even less
    like the sample.  \r\n\r\nYou also realize that the 'a' and 'e' are the same letter
    flipped over. The counters are not the same in DIN. The tail of the 't' is different,
    and so on. \r\n\r\nI believe this is a 'mutilated' font, but I can't believe that
    DIN was where it began. I will keep looking for a bit, to see if something else
    seems close, but there is also the possibility of a mixed-font origin, put together
    like Frankenstein's monster from various parts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
