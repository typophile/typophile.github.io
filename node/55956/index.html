  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I think I&rsquo;m going gaga!</p>
<p>Lately I seem to see Rotis just about everywhere! On the packages of food spices and fancy farmaceuticals, on medicins and magazines, envelopes and logo&rsquo;s (I guess when my dreams would feature type it would be Rotis as well&hellip;). I live in the Netherlands, which is worse enough (for Rotis-spotting that is), but when I&rsquo;m in Germany it&rsquo;s even worse. I see the quirky lowercase a, c and e from far away. Just what is it that makes this font so irritable to the eye? And I still haven&rsquo;t worked out if I love it or hate it (it certainly isn&rsquo;t for everyone!)&hellip;</p>
<p>Does anyone have simular experiences with this angry mother of a font? Am I still to be saved or have I become an incurable type-geek?! And how about your personal font fixations?</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>Cheers, Queneau</p>

<p>Rotis is not too bad especially at smaller sizes. I spent ages looking for an alternative for my business card but ended up going back to it. I had to modify some of the glyphs as they were not looking right.</p>
<p>I have to remind myself being a designer though that most people have no idea what names of fonts are and don&rsquo;t care. There are so many other elements that make good design. A good font will look terrible if the typography is not up to scratch.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m having a Dax overload at the moment, it seems everybody and their dog is using Dax/Daxline over here (from stupid free tabloids to a community center for people with disabilities). Also, I&rsquo;ve been getting really tired of seeing TheSans everywhere, which is a shame because it&rsquo;s a really great typeface.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Does anyone have simular experiences with this angry mother of a font?&quot;</em>
:-) Is it angry? Rather strikes me as a bit… bitchy. 
Rotis is certainly a font that lends itself to &ldquo;being seen everywhere&rdquo; simply because it&rsquo;s so distinctive. Also, I personally don&rsquo;t think the problem is that it&rsquo;s <em>over</em>-used, but rather that it&rsquo;s often <em>mis</em>used. I used to hate it with a passion, but I&rsquo;ve seen it used to great effect and have actually gotten very satisfactory results using it myself. I suspect it&rsquo;s not an easy one to use. (Like I said, bitchy. ;-) ) 
It sure doesn&rsquo;t help that to many graphic designers (at least over here), hating Rotis seems to qualify as a natural, if not required, attitude. :-/</p>

Just because it breaks a few typographic rules doesn&rsquo;t make it bad. But it&rsquo;s bitchy alright! It needs quite a lot of attention to get it to work, but i believe it can be beautiful. I&rsquo;m not too sure about using it for longer texts though, that might just be pushing things too far.</p>
<p>I also think it is a rather &lsquo;cold&rsquo; typeface (see james' link), quite brainy and aloof. It&rsquo;s the same kind of feeling I get from DIN. I don&rsquo;t see how it could be used for texts dealing with &lsquo;emotions&rsquo;, though maybe you can prove me wrong.</p>
<p>@ Altaira: Dax also annoys me a lot (along with Sari and a few other &lsquo;friendly, rounded, modern&rsquo; faces). I&rsquo;ve used it for a project once or twice, but it&rsquo;s a dead end for me now.</p>

Dunno, I&rsquo;d put that the other way round: I&rsquo;m not sure the fact that it consciously breaks a few type design conventions automatically makes it good.</p>
<p>Btw I once read a book set in Rotis Serif. It was not easy. For my tastes, it&rsquo;s maybe a bit too loud and self-important for text.</p>

<p>I also once had the experience of reading a book (No Logo) in Rotis which made me seasick after a while.</p>
<p>Conversely, I never tire of Cronos or Myriad (and even Stone Sans) though they&rsquo;re everywhere in the UK these days.</p>
<p>I wish we wouldn&rsquo;t have to see the same fonts on packaging, posters and shop signs everywhere. I&rsquo;m a hypocrite there though, as I use Myriad a lot, choosing the &lsquo;safe&rsquo; option, and one I like. But at least its character fits with my uses.</p>
