  a cut of Au Bauer Text Initials that I purchased waaaay back int the 80's from Phil's
  Fonts; it's not a particularly good cut, with stray points and path directional
  issues, along with kerning/spacing concerns.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone here know of a newer
  version of this? I'm sure other fonts exist with other names, any would do, but
  I'm thinking it's time to retire the old girl and replace her with a good, clean
  opentype face. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aaa_4555.jpg]"

    Castcraft.\r\n\r\nPhil's Fonts still lists it too, but that's probably what you
    bought. \r\n\r\nYou might check out Shango: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango/\r\n\r\nor
    Cresci: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterperfect/cresci/\r\n\r\nboth are available
    as Open TYpe."
