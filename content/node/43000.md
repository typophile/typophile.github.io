  body: "Does the U have a stem on the right? The serifs on this letter are more like
    an upper case letter than lower case. I was looking at Gill's [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/pilgrim_virtual/?sample_text=you%20YOU|'Pilgrim']]
    u.c. and at his [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Perpetua&x=16&y=6&sample_text=you%20YOU|'Perpetua']]
    u.c. I think the 'y' may be customized to be the same size as the u.c. letters,
    if the whole thing is not custom in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    for Pistilli Roman, anyone care to comment on whether it is indeed unavailable
    in digital format?"

  body: "mdp\r\nAs pattyfab pointed out URW issued Didoni as a Pistilli Roman clone
    and it was also available on the inexpensive collection of fonts from GreenStreet
    under the guise of \"Galeere\" in their \"Elegant Fonts\" range (not sure of legal
    position on this). You may also want to search out Image Club's \"Didi\" font
    which is lighter but of the same style. I have been searching for some time for
    Pistilli Roman and have not yet found a digital version.\r\n- Malcolm"
