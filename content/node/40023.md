  I need some help, and where else coud I get it?\r\nI have the d\xE9j\xE0 vu sensation
  of the face, but I don\xB4t know how to identify it. Tried Identiyfont, underware,
  ourtype, dtl. I just know it has a dutch genesis.\r\nCan anyone help?\r\nThanx ;)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dutch_type_4234.gif]\r\n\r\nIt
  reminds me of \"vista\", and the \"g\" looks like a Gerard Unger's one.\r\nIt's
  a beautifull face, but I'd like to know who drew it."

    but you can have a (low-res) look at the complete thing at <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=sR9g5xPPJVQC&printsec=frontcover\">Google
    Books</a>.\r\n\r\nI hope <a href=\"http://www.010publishers.nl/catalogue/book.php?id=460\">010</a>
    does a second edition."
