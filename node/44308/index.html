<p>Latest work of mine. Looking for some opinions and maybe ideas related to this logo. It`s about a very new firm, design firm, trying new stuff in graphic design. unusual approach of everything. Something like &ldquo;we do it as we want not as you want&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Personally I believe that even for doing somethig unusual stuff you need to have a strong understanding of the usual things. And when you know the usual things very well, It becomes really difficult to do something unusual.</p>
<p>Keep playing with visuals, not with Photoshop.</p>

<p>It doesn’t really say anything about graphic design to me. It looks more like a logo for a biology lab…</p>
<p>Ross</p>
<p>well :)) the ethos was just a momentarily thought but it isn<code>t really an ethos, so... Of course i</code>m not gonna use that! anyway, the biology lab look alike is fine for me, as long as i have no other &ldquo;general picture&rdquo; of a design that might say something about graphic design at all. so yes, i could use some tips :D.</p>
<p>In other words i tried to go for an organic look, an organic feel as the general line for the logo. Since it looks as a biology lab logo to you i think i hit the target. The second  thing i wanted to pursue was to illustrate accomplishment, movement (dynamism) and outcome. And as any designer i thought that something different wouldn`t be that bad considering that this logo is going to be seen by ordinary people not graphic artists and critiques and so on.</p>
<p>Some one has to admit that the logo fits the &ldquo;design laboratory&rdquo;, doesn`t it? ;)</p>
<p>Cheers :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Biology lab&rdquo; and &ldquo;organic&rdquo; are not compatible terms in my mind.</p>
<p>A lab can mean sterile, static, clean, harsh, controlled; even in a biology lab the natural things studied are placed in beakers, dishes and containers.  Organic means life, nature, leafy, messy, hairy, spiky - yet subtly and sublimely ordered.  There are modern ways of capturing the essence of both concepts, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve successfully struck on either in this design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll speak for myself as to the design&rsquo;s &ldquo;cheapness&rdquo;: the use of the glow and glass effects is very Web 2.0, and the font choice is dull and not at all exciting.</p>
<p>Overall, if you&rsquo;re going to exploit a lab concept, then you need to communicate the sense of awe and discovery that entails scientific research, not the necessity of sleeping on a cot in the lab because you need to monitor your experiment at 3:30am.  Your design is communicating more of the latter at this point.  Actually, it&rsquo;s communicating that your experiment has failed and the last three years of research is out the window and you will never get your PhD.</p>
<p>That is, of course, if you&rsquo;re really going for lab, and not organic after all&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is the best I can do with the concept as originally presented in the limited time I have available for these things. The smaller type size has two effects; 1) adds dynamism and visual stimulation, 2) creates a sense of refinement and tasteful design.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/marosi_outcome_3745.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>&ldquo;Output&rdquo; is a bit obscure as to its implied meaning. Some potential customers will look at that word and wonder what&rsquo;s meant by it, causing a sense of doubt in their minds.</p>
<p>For a business logo it&rsquo;s important to be positive, leaving no room for doubt or indecision. Be optimistic and offer potential clients something they can relate to. The first question a business owner has on their mind when dealing with a design firm is, &ldquo;What are you going to do for me? How will your design services improve my business and make me more money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it helps to offer a benefit. The only suitable alternative word I came up with is &ldquo;Outcome&rdquo;. In other words, there&rsquo;s something in it for the customer. An outcome. Some people may find that word inuendo-loaded tho, suggestive of sexual activity. It&rsquo;s nice and compact as words go, but I recommend finding a better alternative word beginning with &lsquo;O&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Replacement fonts used are Futura regular and some other sans with a double story a. Like it matters. Anything will do as long it&rsquo;s a reasonable match.</p>
<p>Marosi, I recommend you take the objections people are making here to your use of glow and three dimensional effects with a grain of salt. They&rsquo;re being needlessly conservative and nitpicky for no good reason other than their personal prejudice against anything outside of dead flat graphic design. I mean really, guys. It&rsquo;s a matter of highbrow taste and the traditional hard-on most graphic designers seem to have for flat color treatments. It makes me laugh because that attitude is so snooty and elitist, and out of touch with reality. I wave my private parts in their general direction.</p>
<p>I think your circular graphic element looks okay and you should go with what makes sense to you. It isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;bad&rdquo;, nor is there anything inherently &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; with it. It is in fact quite creative, and progressive.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My initial thoughts are &ldquo;we do it as we want not as you want&rdquo; is the wrong approach &hellip; or at least incorrect wording. So depending on how you&rsquo;re approaching it, a rethink might be in order. I believe &ldquo;Output&rdquo; might even miss the mark you&rsquo;re trying to convey &hellip; to me it says &ldquo;we output stuff, we&rsquo;re your monkeys&rdquo; &hellip; a repetitive/mechanical task, nothing about free thought or inspiring ideas.</p>
<p>The logo seems pretty generic in my opinion, and doesn&rsquo;t really express &ldquo;output&rdquo;. I also tend to agree that the shiny look should be a treatment rather than the actual mark - i.e, any logo can have a web2.0 look applied &hellip; but that&rsquo;s your decision.</p>
