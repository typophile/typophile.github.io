body: 'At a used bookstore just outside Philly, called Walk A Crooked Mile Books,
  I found some typophilic books that my be of interest to some of you. <BR> <BR>1.  <i>This
  Fortunate Man: Edward DeWitt Taylor</i> <BR>It&#39;s a 1948 AIGA &#34;keepsake&#34;,
  1200 printed. It&#39;s a small, 32pg book, letterpress printed &#40;I presume&#41;
  by Stanford Univ. Press in Linotype Caslon Old Face and English Caslon &#40;for
  the titling&#41;. It&#39;s only $10 and is in very good condition. Something for
  the AIGA completist. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>2. <i>American Typestting Corporation Specimen
  Book</i> <BR>It&#39;s a tall, narrow book. Bound with a plastic comb binding, the
  cover&#39;s a bit worn, but the interior is in good condition. It has sections titled:
  Linotype, Monotype, Ludlow, Foundry, Copy Casting, along with an index. It&#39;s
  about 130 pgs, with 2 brochures from Bertsch &#43; Cooper inside. <BR> <BR>Those
  2 are interesting finds, but not anything amazing. The next book is very impressive.
  <BR> <BR>3. <i>Specimen Book of Type Styles: Mergenthaler Linotype Company</i> <BR>This
  is massive tome, around a foot wide and about 8 inches tall, was published in 1915.
  It has 1,078 pages of what appears to be <i>every</i> bit of type Linotype had to
  offer. It&#39;s got a stamp in the front matter designating it &#39;Copy No. 138&#39;.
  It&#39;s got a great hard cover that&#39;s well worn, but the interior is in very
  good condition. This is clearly a luxurious resource, because it features multi-color
  printing at various points, to showcase the multitude of layouts and design possibilities
  that the Linotype library can make possible. It also includes a comprehesive &#39;foreign
  types&#39; section with Hebrew, Arabic, Armenian, Russian, &#39;German&#39; &#40;meaning
  blackletter&#41; types, and others. The price on the interior cover is $200. I couldn&#39;t
  find an example of this publication on <a href="http://www.linotype.org/bibliography.html">Linotype.org</a>,
  so I don&#39;t have any info on it. I didn&#39;t have my digital camera with me,
  but I can go back and snap some shots if anyone would like. If I had the $$$, I&#39;d
  buy it for myself. It&#39;s pretty astounding. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the info for
  the seller: <BR><b>Walk a Crooked Mile Books</b> <BR>Devon at Gowen Street <BR>Philadelphia,
  PA 19119 <BR>215-242-0854 <BR> <BR>&#40;By the way, I&#39;m not a representative
  of the store, I&#39;m just posting this for the benefit of Typophile readers.&#41;'
