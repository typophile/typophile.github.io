body: I am looking for a program that I can print all of my fonts (like font book).
  But I would like to list all my fonts in collumns and in a WYSIWYG format or just
  the name of the font in the actual typeface. Any sugguestions?

  body: Just like that but instead of sample text, it would print the font name in
    the typeface. for example, futura would print the name in futura. I had a program
    for os9 called Font lister that did it. it was buggy though.

    system folder)

  body: "I don't think there currently is any really good way to do what you are describing.
    Most tools that claim to do this tend to have reliability issues. The reason is
    that in order for the samples to be generated, all of the fonts have to be turned
    on. In most cases, people who are using this sort of tool have more fonts than
    can pracitally turned on at once. So, to really work well, the tool would have
    to turn fonts off and on as it went through the collection. If there are any bad
    fonts, the application would have to be able to handle it. \r\nThe same problem
    exists with WYSIWYG font menus, but to a lesser degree. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I've
    used an Applescript that generates an InDesign file from active fonts. You can
    get it here if you're interested.\r\nhttp://www.portlandtype.com/news/?p=54"
