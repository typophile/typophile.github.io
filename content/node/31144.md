    a grim and horrible reality we see every day on the news. \r\n\r\nSecondly, let
    me give you the flavor of the ads we see. Here is one from the Superbowl yesterday.
    \r\n\r\nThe premise of this series of beer ads is that their beer is so good that
    people will do anything to get it. In this particular ad there is one bottle left
    in the cooler as two young guys come up to it. Guy one says \"shall we do 'rock,
    paper, scissors\" for it?\" \"Ok,\" says guy two. Then guy one counts one two
    three, and guy two flashes out a flat hand, while guy one simultaneously makes
    a throwing motion and guy two falls straight to the ground, knocked out.\r\n\r\nHe
    says to the others at the party, who look at him, \"he threw paper, I threw a
    rock\", and walks off with the bottle of beer. We see guy two waking up and moaning
    as guy one walks off. \r\n\r\nThis one is extreme--it was even mentioned in today's
    Washington Post , but the tone and style are often seen. "

    it's a matter of context: our soldiers are dying in Afghanistan, but I don't think
    the overwhelming majority of Canadians are as obsessed with it to the point that
    anything that even has a whiff of exploitation automatically sends up a red flag
    and generates excessive hand-wringing.\r\n\r\nSaw the ad you mentioned: we thought
    it was actually pretty funny until he threw the rock, but the real nadir was the
    guy walking past at the end giving the groggy guy a low five.\r\n\r\nAt that point,
    we both looked at each other, shrugged, and said \"it figures....\"\r\n\r\nI'm
    not disagreeing with you in that there does seem to be a real \"I've got mine,
    screw the rest of you\" attitute in marketing in the U.S. these days, but if you
    think about it, Bush and his neocon buddies got elected with pretty much the same
    attitude.  \r\n\r\nSince it \"sold the product\" then, is it surprising that some
    copycat marketer figures it'll work for beer too?"

    is not one of those contexts. That is the device of the point of the ad: to catch
    your attention with an apparently statement of horrible cruelty, only to turn
    out to be the most innocent of activities: tweaking the look of type on a printed
    page.  \r\n\r\nI guess I'm tender-hearted as I have never found any of this stuff
    funny. I'm glad to see for a second day in a row that the Washington Post has
    slammed the Superbowl ads, though. Today they refer to them as having 'sophomoric
    violence'. So maybe there's hope that this stuff will go out of fashion. I do
    think, as Linda wrote, that the bullying attitude of Bush has something to do
    with the fashion, and maybe the country turning massively against him will help
    change the mood. "

    public to tell us when they see black and white.\" They made it very clear that
    ethics only enters their thinking in so far as it may alienate someone they want

    responbility as far as affecting the public, they will continue to test any attention-getting
    device, whether it is degrading and corrupting or not. \r\n\r\nThe good news is
    that if people don't buy, it will stop. So while in a desire to get attention
    'marketing' is quite willing to be degrading and unethical--\"it's just business\"
