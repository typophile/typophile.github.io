body: 'My home was burgled on Wednesday when my wife and I were at our respective
  offices, as we frequently are mid-day. In addition to years worth of Typographica
  archives on my laptop and a few unbacked-up client folders, I lost all my photographs
  - including much of what I shot at Typecon. Of course, the world being what it is
  and I being who I am &#40;and thus probably worthy of whatever negative karma is
  hanging over my head&#41;, I had just taken down the .mac galleries with my own
  &amp; others pictures. <BR> <BR>I imagine it&#39;s far too much to ask &amp; that
  nobody could possibly have them, but did anyone actually download any/many of the
  pictures that i took? <BR> <BR>Also, if anyone sees the following floating around,
  they were also stolen: a huge collection of Criterion edition Kurosawa, Hitchcock,
  Godard &amp; Truffaut DVDs; the Buster Keaton box set from Kino; the Harold Lloyd
  collection; lots of Japanese &amp; Korean contemporary films on DVD; Kieslowski&#39;s
  Decalogue on DVD and his Red/White/Blue on DVD.. And of course my entire camera
  collection incl. various old manual Nikons, rare rangefinders, my Leica 24mm Elmarit
  lens, and the Canon Powershot s50 that I bought recently and carry with me everywhere.
  Just, you know, in case you see it around. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    my friend. <BR> <BR>All I can do on my end is check my browser&#39;s cache for
    the photos. <BR> <BR>hhp

    I am sorry I don&#39;t have even a browser cache to review for you. All I can
    offer is my sympathy. <BR> <BR>Hang in there. <BR> <BR>Jon
