  body: "Kristian, are you by any chance using a Mac running OS 9 software? Because
    there was a recent site and server upgrade; this might cause you to see pages
    that appear to have a very primitive layout. I had the same problem a few days
    ago.\r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/34862\"><strong>this
    entry</strong></a> for more info on the server upgrade.\r\n\r\nAlso have a look
