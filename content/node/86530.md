  I don't have much to work with, just the following two text samples:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample1_3803.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample2_5190.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  two samples look similar to my eye, but the S letters are a little different, so
  I think they're two different fonts.  Any information anyone's able to provide would
  be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!"
