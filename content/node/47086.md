  was created in MS Volt. (Such as Arabic Typesetting)\r\nI used in it some glyphs
  didn't have Unicode code. Such as (Theh with Khah \u062B\u062E).\r\n\r\nWhen I created
  a pdf file with Adobe Acrobat and open it in Adobe Reader or in Acrobat itself and
  try to search to theh with Khah \u062B\u062E, I didn\u2019t find it.\r\nAcrobat
  and some program can't find any glyph or a ligature didn't have a Unicode codepage.\r\nHow
  could I solve that?\r\nIf I give this glyph (ligature) a Unicode code from unicode
  private area, could I find it. Did Acrobat or other program support Private Area
  (UPA)?\r\nTo whom had Mac computer, shall we face the same problems.\r\n\r\nIf we
  used non Unicode fonts to create the pdf file and try to use search to any glyph,
  it didn't find anything. (It didn't find the base glyph such Jeem, beh \u2026 etc)
