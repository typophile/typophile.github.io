  Kerning Assistance.\r\n\r\nThere are some that comes with FOG, but they don't include
  all the accented letters. I could set this up myself, but since I am rather novice
  in FOG maybe I will forget about some classes.\r\n\r\nI'm about to all by myself
  produce my first commercial font that is going to be distributed, so I want to make
  sure I make everything correct and don't forget about something.\r\n\r\nSo I was
  thinking there perhaps could be some resources out there? Template-files and such
  for this kind of matters?\r\n\r\nThanks, and kind regards from Sweden![img:sites/default/files/old-images/assistancemetrics_5808.png]"

    nothing to do with metrics in Fontographer... or am I missing something?\r\n"

  body: I just thought you might like to check them if you have time. I don't have
    a word about metrics in Fontographer, sorry. I know there are test text files
    for checking the results, tho.

  body: "The problem with using already built sets of classes is that one set will
    not work with all fonts. It's not that hard to build a set from scratch and you
    are guaranteed that it will be optimized for the font you are working on.\r\n\r\nI
    don't use Fontographer anymore, but the principle is the same for any font editor.
    I start out by analyzing all my glyphs, sorting them into groups with similar
    right or left sides. This becomes the basis for my kerning classes. Keep in mind
    that you don't necessarily want to group accented glyphs with their unaccented
    counterparts. Also keep in mind that some character combinations may never come
    up in normal use.\r\n\r\nYes, it can be a bit tedious, but there isn't really
    any short cut that works better than thorough planning and methodical follow-through.
    With some people, it helps to have music on. I like to listen to audio books or
    talk radio."
