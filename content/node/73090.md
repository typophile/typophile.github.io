body: "Hello\r\nI'm looking for a font that evokes the traditional visual motifs of
  Pacific Northwest Indians. (I'm attaching some visual references/examples).\r\n\r\n
  \r\nThe closest thing I've been able to find is Malamondo, by Fenotype\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/malamondo/\r\nI
  do really like this font, but it seems a little too 1950s Beatnik-ish for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any suggestions you have!\r\n\r\n-Rob[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beavertattoo_small_5526.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/na_pnw_raven_art_5097.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/223_6365.jpg]"

    kind you show. The treatment of line and volume is totally different.

    the Maori are on the opposite side of the world, so that would be culturally misleading
    if it's meant to mimic the PAC NW.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is a reason to work on
    a new face. "

    don't believe all the planned special characters are available, but I see the
    standard font has been released. If there is a bit of time in the schedule, you
    could get up with Ross about any few special characters needed."

  body: "Huronia would work well.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how Huronia relates to Haida
    art, but it is a very successful font that I don't think would clash with it.
    \r\n\r\nFurther, I think it would be more suitable than a generic \"ethnic\" style."
