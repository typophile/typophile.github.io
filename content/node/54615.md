  body: 'If you do not need A3 and laser, I am really impressed by my HP Photosmart
    C7280 all-in-one: wireless and ethernet, good scanner, great photo printer, quite
    quick B&W A4 inkjet (plus photocopier and fax, if you need them). Used to have
    A3 lasers costing thousands, this little gizmo is fantastic (and for less than
    the cost of a replacement toner cartridge for my old GCC Elite XL).'

    like to have an EPSON Stylus, but this does pretty good for a little HP. EPSON's
    have a black that can't be reached with HP's."
