  awesome slab serif and fell in love with the 'S'.  I searched through 29 pages of
  MyFont slab serif faces & didn't see one like this.  It's quite possible that I
  missed it.\r\n\r\nCan anyone ID this type?\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/applaus2008_5720.jpg]"

  body: I don't think it's adelle - looks like [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=theserif+black+italic&x=0&y=0|TheSerif
    Black Italic]] to me. Look at the cap R, K, M, S for comparison.
