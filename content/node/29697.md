  body: "A couple of days ago, when service to this site was so rudely interrupted
    (for me at least), I was hunting for this font, searching Parts 11, 12 and 14
    of the Script Font ID Guide, AND the printing font samples in the new FontBook,
    and came to the conclusion that this is possibly a 'personal' font, made from
    a printing sample. As our FAQ says, these kinds of fonts are very cheap and easy
    to make.\r\n\r\nSimilar fonts I found during my search <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-erikrighthand/\">FF
    ErikRighthand</a>; a free font called <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=kaela\">Kaela</a>
    by Harold Lohner; and another called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-erikrighthand/\">Plz

    and thought it was a good match, although I can see now that it's not identical.
    It has essentially four versions of each cap letter, which allows a better simulation
    of hand lettering. Frankly, If I saw this I would think it was the posted font,
    unless I could compare each and every letter side by side. Only the stem-less
    U is an obvious ID style mismatch. To me the rest looks like it could be lettering
    by the same person who made the posted font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
