body: Hello everyone, could I please take a moment of your time and ask you to take
  a look at some logos we had designed for us.  I am not an artist and could really
  use some constructive feedback.  Thank you everyone!! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/67400.jpg"

  body: 'The tire tracks will work on-screen but when you go to print them they will
    fill-in in smaller sizes and become a blob. You obviously recognize the problem
    with the lowercase r. It creates a terrible negative space gap. Have you looked
    at other typefaces? I think you need to.  <BR>Basicly loose the Photoshop and
    Illustrator gimics&#40;the tints the reflection the outlines&#41;. Make a logo
    that works in black and white and is strong. Most logos don&#39;t exist by themselves
    they are surrounded by images and words that reinforce the subject. The word here
    is KISS: Keep It Simple'

  body: It was only by looking at your website that I realised you were not involved
    in bicycles, which is what the tyre tracks had led me to assume. The letterforms
    need to be developed if you are going to stick with that sloped face, but it isn&#39;t
    working for the off-road &amp; performance line something simpler and easier to
    read is called for. Specifically the x t and r in your samples need work. The
    outlining is too much, especially where it encloses the whole logo, straighter
    lines without the indentations would be better. However, as a more important consideration,
    I did this search <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;imgsz=xxlarge&amp;q=xtreme+logo"
    target="_blank">http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;imgsz=xxlarge&amp;q=xtreme&#43;logo</a>
    which reveals more xtremes than you would want to shake a stick at and none of
    them particularly noteworthy.  I would look at an image/shape &#40;not an X&#41;
    and treat the type simply. <BR>Tim

  body: Thank you for taking a look...I guess what I was attempting to achieve was
    an eye catching logo that people could remember.  If you have any other suggestions
    that I could pass on to the developers it would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    again everyone! <BR> <BR>Mike

  body: In addition to what others have said about the font, the latest version does
    not read as xtreme to me at all.  I see a graphic, that will not produce well
    in small applications, and then the word &#34;treme.&#34;  You may also need to
    use the design in one color applications and this concept will not necessarily
    work well.  A logo should be able to successfully convey what you desire in multiple
    applications &#40;web, print, signage, wearables, etc.&#41; and I don&#39;t think
    this will do so as currently presented. <BR> <BR>- J.

  body: 'The logo in post #3 is, in my opinion, aiming squarely at the middle of the
    market and I think it hits the mark. While I agree that the design needs a lot
    of adjustment &#40;the outline around the type is too slavish, making it bumpy
    and chipped, and the &#39;r&#39; is a bit odd&#41; the logo immediately communicates
    the X-treme Sprots feel you&#39;re shooting for. It does it in a very generic
    and expected way, but it does it. Though it doesn&#39;t say trucks to me, it&#39;s
    more biking and motocross. <BR> <BR>If you want to sit squarely in the middle
    of the crowd, then I think this direction works, if you want to be memorable,
    I&#39;d try again. <BR> <BR>I think the most interesting part is the tire tracks,
    but their current design will be a mess at small sizes. The tire tracks are probably
    a good element to work with and create some unique and interesting visuals. The
    tread pattern alone could make some really bold and interesting opportunities
    for a designer.'

  body: The logo looks more like a logo used by tuners &#40;the kind of guys that
    put coffee cans on the exhausts of civics&#41; than an off road company. <BR>
    <BR>Maybe looking a bit dirty and mudcovered might help a bit. Regarding the tire
    tracks - they look like street tracks not offroad trenches. <BR> <BR>The logo
    doesn&#39;t seem suited to the respective market.  As other posters have mentioned,
    that syllable done in that type face is in need of a typographic intervention.
