body: "I would love any suggestions on a font / fonts to use for this website.  I
  am not a design professional, and I'm struggling with trying to create a design
  in Squarespace.  I've had a website for a couple of years on Wordpress, but never
  had any branding or consistency - my header was just the photo with the generic
  text.  I'm not opposed to buying  any fonts (I'm on a Mac), and I do have an older
  version of Photoshop (I think it's CS3), so if the font isn't supported by Squarespace,
  I could  buy it and just incorporate it into the .psd image.  I'm not even sure
  where to start looking for the type of font, but I know this is not the right one.
  \ By the way, I'm not married to anything I have here - I might even change the
  photo, but it would be something like this. I think it needs to be something more
  masculine / creative?  Thank you for your suggestions.\r\nSue[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DoanWebiteFrontPageType_4235.jpg]"

  body: "I would recommend an old style sans serif.\r\nSans, because the consistency
    of line weight and lack of serifs connotes mechanical ef\uFB01ciency, and old-style
    (a.k.a. humanist) to connote custom attention to detail.\r\n\r\nMy effort in this
    genre is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sensibility/\">Sensibility</a>.\r\nYou
    can use \u201Cold style\u201D, \u201Chumanist\u201D and \u201Csans\u201D as keyword
    searches at font sites to \uFB01nd others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
