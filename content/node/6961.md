  edition printings of the fictional writings of Samuel Clemens? I am particularly
  interested in fonts that were used to publish his short stories.

  body: Micah <BR> <BR>I would think that there is no reason to assume that any particular
    face would have been used. Laurence J. Johnson&#39;s Caslon was a fairly common
    American face at that time. A Google search might serve you well or go to one
    of the Mark Twain sites.  <BR> <BR>Clemens did serve as a printer&#39;s devil
    as a youth &#40;nice photo of him holding a composing stick on the cover of one
    of the back issue _Printing History_ journals&#41; and, interestingly enough,
    he is considered the first author to submit a manuscript using the typewriter.
    And lost a bunch of money in the development of a mechanical typesetting machine.

  body: Gerald, Thanks. <BR> <BR>I was strongly leaning towards Caslon &#40;Adobe&#39;s&#41;...
    <BR> <BR>I did quite a bit of disappointing Google searching before posting here.
    :-&#40; <BR> <BR>Because of his experience in printing, I rather suspected he
    might have had a hand in choosing the design of his books, but I also was prepared
    to strongly disagree with how the first prints were set; particularly in choice
    and use of face. Still, knowing what was originally chosen could help me to make
    intelligent choices of my own, as in keeping with the original spirit as possible...

  body: Micah <BR> <BR>If you are thinking of a digital and would like to get close
    to the Johnson Caslon try Lanston&#39;s Caslon Oldstyle 337. It is pretty much
    right on the money a very good rendition of the metal Monotype version, which
    is considered the truest to the Johnson. The Johnson type itself was said to cast
    from original Caslon punches or matrices &#40;I forget which&#41;.

    made strikes from the original punches. Lanston gained access to the same punches
    for their cutting. I am not sure if you read the article I wrote on the subject?

    <BR> <BR>Maybe I should post a pdf version of this edition of <i>&#34;The Fount&#34;</i>
    <a href="http://lanstontype.com/CaslonATF.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/CaslonATF.html</a>
    on the Lanston web site. By the way, I am thinking of publishing a new edition
    of <i>&#34;The Fount&#34;</i> and was thinking of asking you to write an article
    for it?

    is spelled correctly, it was named after the inventor. <BR><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/yankee/cymach6.html"

    I ordered photocopies of the mechanical drawings from the patent office. Patent
    office photocopies were very reasonable. The response to this particular request
    met with heated resistance. It was, I believe they said, the largest patent ever
    filed. Linotype ended up with two machines, they needed some of the patents. One
    the machines were donated to the museum, the other to the war effort.  <BR> <BR>We
    saw great &#34;financial wisdom&#34; in cancelling our order. I think trucking
    was the problem.

  body: Gerald G <BR> <BR>Yeah, I most likely did read your article on the subject
    and, if around 1993, would have used it in a review of your Caslon for _The Typographer_
    &#40;mentioned recently elsewhere on another Typophile thread&#41;. <BR> <BR>Liked
    _The Fount_ a lot. Had a bit of class to it in a world then not all that concerned
    with class. Sure, if you get it together, I&#39;d be honored to contribute. <BR>
