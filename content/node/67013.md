body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI'm working in tandem with two in-house designers on a news
  magazine redesign. The new nameplate/logotype is a heavily customized amalgamation
  of [[http://typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100008|Gotham Black]]
  and Font Bureau's [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Anisette|Anisette Bold]] (think
  very wide and bold). The serif we've chosen is [[http://dstype.com/index.php?id=57|Glosa
  Display]] for big heads, and [[http://dstype.com/index.php?id=25|Glosa Text]] for
  body copy. We're also using [[http://vllg.com/Schwartzco/Stag#panel=poster|Stag]],
  a contemporary slab, for headlines, decks, etc.\r\n\r\nMy question is about a sans
  family. I recommended [[http://klim.co.nz/national_samples.php|National]] by Klim
  Foundry since (to me) it pairs well with the above typefaces. The Art Director is
  not sold, and feels that it might be too feminine for a news magazine. I personally
  disagree, but one of the great things about National which is rare in a grotesque
  is that it has every imaginable figure style (old style, lining, tabular in both
  heights, etc.) as well as small caps. We'll be using these features in Glosa, so
  our sans fonts also need text figures and small caps. The Art Director likes Stag
  Sans, but it lacks all the above Opentype features except for fractions.\r\n\r\nSorry
  for the long intro, but can anyone recommend a sans serif that pairs well with Glosa
  and Stag? One that is Opentype with old style figures and small caps? It would be
  even more icing on the cake if italic small caps were part of the package.\r\n\r\nI
  might still be able to sell them on National, but want to have other viable options.\r\n\r\nAdvice
  much appreciated."

  body: "I usually don't recommend my own typefaces but in this case I would say you
    can try Prelo, since it was designed to work with Glosa. You can see them together
    in the french newspaper Le Figaro, they share the same x-height and the same OT
    features.\r\n\r\nAlthough I must say that National is a wonderful typeface and
    it would certainly work pretty well.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDino dos Santos\r\nDSTYPE"

  body: "Prelo is very nice indeed! Especially given the condensed, compressed, and
    slab versions. We might even consider replacing Stag with Prelo slab. National
    has become my own Helvetica, but I think I could work with Prelo too. I just shared
    it with the art director, so well see.\r\n\r\nThanks Dino! :)"
