  for my Bachelor Degree, about film title design and its relationship to film, and
  about the effects of the title design on the audience and their perception of a
  film. I was just wondering if anyone hade any tips on authors or books on this subject?
  Or maybe you have any other suggestions as to where I might find valuable information?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nLisa\r\n\r\nps.
  hope I have posted this in the right place - I'm new here, so sorry if not."

    are completely new to me (there seems to be many interesting articles on typotheque.com
    for example. And I didn't know about the Saul Bass documentary, I have to check
    that out). Thanks again, and if you happen to come up with any more tips and advices
    I would gladly take them.\r\n\r\nLisa"
