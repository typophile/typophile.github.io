  friend of mine wants to buy Bickham to set up addresses with the swash caps and
  will buy the OTF version if necessary, but I can't figure out if they are included.\r\n\r\nAny
  additional info is welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    \r\n\r\nHere's a PDF that shows all the alternatives. \r\nhttp://store1.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/1736.pdf\r\n\r\nNow
    the only way you can use the opentype features like alternatives is with a program
    that support opentype fonts or has a glyph palette (WORD is not a program that
    supports OTFs). \r\n\r\n"

  body: An OpenType font will work in Word, but you can't get to the extra glyphs.

  body: "<em>WORD is not a program that supports OTFs</em>\r\n\r\nIt does. But not
    every OpenType feature.\r\nThe same is true of all applications!\r\nFor instance,
    Photoshop has no glyph palette.\r\nAnd now, many foundries are putting features
    in OpenType fonts (e.g. <hist>, <unic>, <afrc>) which are not yet supported in
    any application, AFAIK.\r\nSo this is one area of fine typography where it's important
    to be knowledgable of which features are in which fonts, and which applications
    support them.\r\n\r\n"

    can actually insert those glyphs in Word. You'll just need to hunt them down using
    Charmap. The spelling won't be preserved, and you might get gibberish if you switch
    to a font other than Bickham.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bickham_in_Word_6657.png]"
