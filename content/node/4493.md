body: I saw Kill Bill 2 tonight and noticed during the film, a font on a set of outdoor
  chairs which said &#34;SOL&#34;. <BR> <BR>The font in particular was a beautiful
  circus/western blend - I undertand this would have been hand rendered, and I am
  unable to find an example. <BR> <BR>If anybody does have any shots from this film,
  of this type - could you please respond.  <BR> <BR>I would like to use the same
  style for a logo I am working on. Once I saw it, I knew it would be perfect. <BR>
  <BR>While on the subject of fonts used for circus&#39;s. Does anybody know the historical
  information behind the use of fonts used for circus&#39;s? <BR> <BR>mwah

  body: I have to say, though I liked both volumes of Kill Bill, I thought the typography
    was a disaster. I understand he&#39;s trying to evoke the flavor of various film
    influences, as he does in making the movies themselves. But to the filmmaking
    end, with the exception of one segment, he uses the influence and makes a better
    scene than what inspired him. <BR> <BR>Not so the type. Rather than create a pastiche
    of typefaces inspired by his source material -- and subtly improve on the originals
    -- he&#39;s created a mishmash. I cringed every time type showed up. The end credits
    at least had something of a classic look, but he didn&#39;t even do those well
    &#40;hello, megadots!&#41;, and it was right on the heels of another credit sequence
    that used a completely different typeface. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know how he managed
    to use a typeface we couldn&#39;t identify, though. Maybe it&#39;s a Corel font.

  body: Yes indeed, the font &#40;written as SOL&#41; features in the scene when Uma
    visits the brothel in Mexico. The chairs are scattered around the place, all with
    the same word &#34;SOL&#34; written on them.  <BR> <BR>So if you have a digital
    camera and go see it. If you take a shot of this font and post it, I will be ever
    so happy. <BR> <BR>I think that maybe the font choices Tarintino made throughout
    KILL BILL were meant to be schitzophrenic and badly done. And were not meant to
    distract from the cinematography - the same way type used to be treated in film
    - badly. <BR> <BR>mwah

    All he can come up with these days is lame pastiche, typographically or otherwise.

  body: I guessed Avant Garde, too, in that original post last month. But I think
    James is right with Century Gothic. The closed &#39;R&#39; and the circular dot
    on the &#39;i&#39; give it away. From what I recall, Monotype made Century Gothic
    to match the look and metrics of Avant Garde, much as they did with Arial to match
    Helvetica.

    Emigre&#39;s Arbitrary as similar &#40;although not the same&#41;, and I&#39;m
