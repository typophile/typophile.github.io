  on a logo for a women's ministry. I'm using Mrs. Eaves for the italic type and Trajan
  for the caps. I think the itals are coming along ok (though let me know if you think
  they look too tight). The kerning on the caps, however, has been driving me crazy
  and I thought it would help to have some other eyes besides mine take a look. My
  main problem is the transition between the R and S. The serifs on each make for
  an awkward transition, so if I kern them too tight it looks funky and if I kern
  them too loose it throws the rest of the word off. \r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRachel[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RE-logo-final_6111.jpg]"

  body: "This is very tight. Reminds me of the '70s style. Did you look at using all
    Mrs. Eaves? One thing is that you can see the weight shift between the cap E and
    other caps. I guess the Romans hadn't made it to small caps yet.\r\n\r\nI think
    you need to get the spacing right around the cap T and then loosen everything
    else up to match. You may need to bring <cite>redeeming</cite> down in size a
    bit to let a little more air in. "

  body: "Tight is one way of putting it. I think what happens is the eye is drawn
    to a problem, the RS combination, that can't be solved (with kerning). And my
    eye is drawn to the double problem of 'min' too tight right above, the RS, (that
    is what it is).\r\n\r\nThere is a large complex white space between R and S that
    one cannot solve with the kind of kerning you've chosen for the rest of the combinations,
    which may be termed, \"as tight as possible regardless of combination without
    or with barely touching features.\" \r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, one thinks,
    \"Aha, the RS that is what it is!\" and kerns accordingly 'from whatever spacing
    that pair brings', opening up the NC, OU, UN combinations slightly, and making
    the EN space more like the ER....then the RS magically works without changing.\r\n\r\nRedeeming
    the lowercase requires a version of the same as above; the big white counters
    of the d, m and n define how tight, e.g. the 'min' combination can be, which would
    be looser than you show it, but not nearly as wide as the n's inside white space...then
    look again at the rest of the combinations, and loosen a little accordingly. Or
    change to a narrower lowercase where the d, m and n don't trap so much white.\r\n\r\nThe
    good thing is, because birds can appear to fly in a variety of sizes and configurations,
    you have some flexibility in positioning them, with the resulting, more pleasingly
    spaced, combination of words, should you decide to do so. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    Letras Oldstyle is a narrower face that has a conservative leg on the R and might

    creates tension and even anxiety. It would seem that redeeming encounters would
    be more relaxed and open feeling. Bird flight is free and smoothe as well. It
    seems that a more open spacing would fit the bill syntactically as well?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Kerning all characters to tight but not touching or just touching damages
    the readability of the word form, I think. Because the internal white space, as
    well as the external shape affects the ideal kerning for even color--as David
    mentioned--mashing all characters together defeats the evenness of the look that
    normally the type designer has built into the font. That hurts readability, and,
    as Chris says, the resulting unevenness is somewhat unsettling. If that's the
    effect you want, fine, but it usually isn't.  \r\n\r\nSans fonts, especially in
    bolder weights, are normally more tightly spaced, so you can more easily do the
    tight tracking or kerning without messing up the look, and get some more punch
    into the look of a word or few words. But here you have lighter weight serif fonts,
    so there's just too much working against you. "

    you're completely right. All of a sudden it became much more readable and relaxed.
    I think sometimes I get a bit too over-eager to kern tight and need to remember
    that an Oldstyle will need more breathing room. What do you think of the RS now?\r\n\r\nI
    love the \"R\" you posted, Jupiter Boy...I'll have to check out Letras. \r\n\r\nThank

  body: "I think Chris is right. Mrs Eaves was conceived of as as widely spaced. If
    you look at promotional material it is all widely spaced. Admittedly it often
    does need help with it's kerning - but keep in mind kerning can be both more or
    less space. Trajan and any all cap arrangement often benefits from wide spacing.
    You have now got maybe typical or even slightly tight spacing, so I would keep
    letting more air in until it almost seems to break apart; and then you can go
    back!\r\n\r\nEarlier in the thread these was some talk about the counters of a
    font determining it's ideal spacing. The idea is that the white space inside the
    O or the U should be equal to the space between two characters. It's a fuzzy idea
    but a powerful nevertheless. How large the letters will be reproduced and the
    distance to the viewer also has an impact. If they will be 6 feet high and you
    will be 10 ft away the letters can generally be closer* than if they will be at
    6pts on a page in which case they will need even more space.\r\n\r\n* But don't
    have to be. See the example in stone example above."

  body: "I may be alone here, but the variance in weight of the heavier E catches
    my eye a bit. You might work with a face that has a true small cap or more weight
    options to mix/match. Trajan, being what it is, looks odd with the small cap treatment
    because of historical factors. I worked with the words a bit myself in Baskerville
    and when spaced out normally the word is pretty long. A wide word mark can be
    trouble because it will often force the size smaller to fit in a narrow space.
    A narrow face could help that.\r\n\r\nFor a quick try, this is pretty tight to
    my eye, and the real small caps give a feel of even weight.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RE_4448.png]"

    is that? The R seems oddly heavy.\r\n\r\nThe good thing about the Trajan is it
    evokes a timelessness that the Baskerville does not. The Baskerville feels bank
    manager-esque to me. That said, you points are still quite valid."

    height. I\u2019m just following the lead set with what I have on hand, which is
    Storm\u2019s John Baskerville (following the Mrs. Eaves direction).\r\n\r\nI think
    the diagonals fatten up a bit on screen, but it is a heavy leg.\r\n\r\nMaybe there
    is a better font that would reduce the width of the mark and allow the letters
    to breath a bit more. I suspect that Rachel's impulse to tighten the letter spacing
    has something to do with wanting to keep the width of the mark more compact."

    \ If you're in Quark, there is a kerning bar at the bottom of the page, with <

  body: "\"I think collision-course typography creates tension and even anxiety\"\r\nIn
    general, I agree with you. But I think 'c-c' spacing anxiety is primarily a function
    of style \u2014 the more handwrought the style, the more human anxiety is created
    by spacing stress, (and 'treatments like patterned or photographic fills, outlines,
    and/or shadows). Brush Script emboldened by a thick outline filled with pictures
    of mountains, beer and sky, tracked to disconnection, kind of anxiety.\r\n\r\nFranklin
    Gothic, Knockout or Empire are perhaps harder to create such anxiety with, by
    spacing or treatment, having their own stylistic anxiety to begin with. Seeming
    more machine made, we not only forgive them, we use their anxiety for 'good',
    emboldened by a thick outline filled with pictures of mountains, beer and sky
    kind of good.;)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    serif faces do (duh) and the shapes caused by interletter spacing don't get trapped
    as much. These shapes have been used numerous times to good advantage by skilled
    type users and even help the communication scenario. Dueling serifs, like prong-horned
    rams, get entangled in battle with generally head=splitting results :-)\r\nAdd
    the pictures of mountains and beer to this and it really gets your goat ;-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
