    body: "Understood but I've been told by people at FontLab to not use the PUA for
      alternate glyphs therefore the glyphs exist as name only with no unicode value
      so customers that don't have Adobe products may not be able to access the alternates
      even if you have a proper substitution in your opentype features.\r\nThe only
      problem of using the PUA I can think of would be your glyph unicode values may
      conflict with other fonts that have glyphs occupying the same spaces, when a
      customer switches from one font to another their letters may change or drop
      out.\r\nFor this reason alternates shouldn't be used in large bodies of text
      where you'd end up making too many corrections because you changed to a different
      font family.\r\nGlyphs that are unmapped can't be copied and pasted, Adobe products
      are an exception allowing you to copy and paste unmapped glyphs between Adobe
      applications.\r\nNow there's a problem with Windows 8.1, I'm finding the salt
      and swsh features don't work properly in Adobe products installed under Windows
      8.1, for example when you double click on N.alt you'll get the regular N instead,
      click on N.swsh and you'll get the regular N again.\r\nMy OT features are correct
      and work perfect under previous versions of Windows using Adobe CS5.\r\nThe
      solution around this is to place your stylistic alternates and swash letters
      as a stylistic sets ss01, ss02 etc. and remove the original salt and swsh features
      completely.\r\nIf there's ever a problem with the Adobe glyph map not working
      properly after an operating system upgrade the customer could still access alternate
      glyphs using a third party character map. If the alternate glyphs are unmapped
      the customer may be out of luck and that font that you worked hard on creating
      beautiful alternates is now a piece of junk from the customer's point of view.\r\nMy
      question still is, should we use the PUA or not? What are the potential problems
      I'm told will occur if I do use the PUA?\r\nIf I unmap the alternate glyphs
      and they're no longer in the PUA the number of people that can access the alternates
      has dropped dramatically."

  body: "The biggest problem with PUA is that it results in mangled text. PUA codepoints
    for glyph variants get inserted into text, replacing semantically meaningful character
    codes. This means that documents using PUA codepoints can't be reliably searched,
    sorted, spellchecked, or subject to any other normal text processing function
    such as changing fonts, copying and pasting into email or a plain text environment,
    or even easy and consistent editing.\r\n\r\nAs a general principle, don't use
    PUA for anything with semantic content. So yes, it is okay to use PUA for ornaments
    or for a client's logo in a font, but as soon as you have text entities that need
    to be interchangeable, you should be avoiding PUA. The only times I ever use PUA
    for semantic content is when I have a client who is working with a closed production
    workflow that requires it, and even then I do everything I can to encourage them
    to find a different workaround and to avoid using the PUA encodings whenever possible."

    body: "Thanks John for your explanation but it raises another question, if the
      PUA is not where you place alternates that may be used as text then where do
      you place them or what unicode range would you put them under?\r\nI see some
      foundries leaving their alternate text based glyphs as name only,  the unicode
      value is blank so there's no code page where the glyphs may be found.\r\nWouldn't
      this cause the same problem for search ability, copying and pasting etc.?\r\nWhere
      can you put alternate semantic glyph content in your font or should the glyphs
      hang with no encoding?\r\nSo if alternate semantic glyphs are present in the
      PUA they can't be processed like normal text but if the glyphs have no encoding
      and exist as name only am I correct in saying that they also can't be processed
      like normal text?\r\nI'm also wondering why Adobe Minion Pro from 2010 has just
      over 400 semantic glyphs in the PUA of the font.\r\nI'm close to releasing a
      new multi weight font family with lots of alternates and I want it to be right
      when it goes out.\r\nThanks again for your comment,\r\nMichael"

  body: "Minion Pro was one of the last fonts which Adobe released before they revised
    their own position on using PUA codepoints, so that's why you find them in Minion
    but not in subsequent fonts.\r\n\r\nSubstitutions of the type <code>sub X from
    [X X1 X2...]</code> are really best reserved for the aalt feature rather than
    salt or ss<em>nn</em>.\r\n\r\nConcerning your question about accessing alternates,
    remember that unicode defines characters, not glyphs, which is why it isn't necessary
    to assign unicode values to alternate glyphs except perhaps for compatibility
    with older applications.\r\n\r\nIf you have a font containing A and A.salt, things
    will behave differently depending on whether you assign A.salt a PUA value or
    give it no unicode value at all.\r\n\r\nIf you assign it no unicode value, then
    any documents containing that character will represent either A or A.salt by the
    same unicode value (U+0041) with some indication of whether the 'salt' feature
    is turned on or off. The alternate glyph will only be accesible via the salt feature
    meaning you won't be able to make use of it in non-OT savvy applications.\r\n\r\nIf
    you choose to assign A.salt a PUA codepoint (let's use U+E000), then the character
    will be accessible either by entering U+0041 and applying the salt feature (in
    applications which support this) or by entering U+E000 directly (an option available
    in all applications). However, if a user chooses the latter option, the glyph
    which appears won't be interpreted as the character 'A' but as the semantically
    undefined character U+E000. Therefore, using PUA points will allow alternates
    to be accessed in non-OT savvy applications, but the alternates won't be searchable,
    spell-checkable etc. Moreover, you're creating a risk that even when using OT-savvy
    applications a user might select the character from a character map (which, depending
    on the application, might result in U+E000 rather than U+0041) rather than via
    OT features without realising the consequences of this action.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd
    say that if you need to support non-OT applications, you can assign PUA codepoints
    for cases where the user wants to *display* the alternates without necessarily
    needing to search the document, but that if you do so you'd want to stress in
    your readme file that alternates should always be accessed using OT features unless
    its absolutely impossible to do so and then hope that people actually read the
    readme file.\r\n\r\nMaybe that will help clarify John's points.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: The whole reason why the character/glyph distinction exists is so that a cleanly
    encoded semantic character string can be represented by an arbitrary collection
    of glyphs. So as soon as a font contains more than one way to display a single
    Unicode character, it makes sense that you <em>need</em> something like OpenType
    Layout glyph processing that maps from the default encoded glyphs (from cmap)
    to the unencoded variant. Trying to come up with a workaround to access variants
    without glyph processing inevitably means breaking character encoding.

    without realizing the consequences of this action.<\r\n\r\nSo by not placing glyphs
    in the PUA it looks like we're protecting people from making a critical mistake
    they may not be aware of and that's using an alternate glyph for text purposes
    you shouldn't use alternates in.\r\n\r\nA professional trained type designer once
    told me if include alternates in my font I needed to plan them all in advance
    and create a custom encoding file in FL and this would build the database creating
    the alternate glyphs with codepoints, however when you went to glyph properties
    the unicode field was blank for each alternates.\r\nCreating encoding files is
    fine if you've got many people working on the project but I work solo and I get
    inspiration for new alternates along the way.\r\nTo me the custom encoding file
    looks like a script for Cmd+G or Ctrl+G, if there's a unicode value to go with
    the glyph name in the encoding file then FL will create the glyph and assign the
    correct unicode value.\r\nAlternate glyphs will be created however there will
    not be a unicode value assigned so it will hang by name only, apparently it's
    fine for a glyph to exist and be usable with out a unicode value in applications
    such Adobe CS and CorelDraw. \r\nWhen it comes to making alternates usable in
    applications such as MSWord, forget it, the customer using alternates where they
    shouldn't creates support emails which we want to keep to a minimum.\r\n\r\nWhen
    a customer asks why they can't access alternate glyphs in MSWord or Windows character
    map I'll have to say sorry it doesn't recognize them.\r\n\r\nI did find a pdf
    from Adobe dated 2006 that said they no longer put glyphs in the PUA but in 2011
    Adobe's Minion Pro still shows alts in the PUA however nothing from Adobe since
    uses the PUA.\r\n\r\nThanks guys for your assistance it's been a long road getting
    back up to speed after a long eighteen years of care giving, I don't know how
    I ever found time to make fonts at all.\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    latest versions of Word for Mac and Word for Windows provide access to some OT
    features such as different figure styles, stylistic sets (only one at a time,
    though), ligatures, and contextual alternates. These work even when alternate

    small caps, titling alternates, swash alternates, discretionary ligatures, historical
