  body: "Maybe it's referring to some special, modified version of some font like
    Lux Sans that the person who gave you the file created. \"luzsans\" only has one
    result on Google. If it was derived from Lux Sans, you'd think that the person
    would have chosen \"LuySans\" though. Maybe the person chose \"LuzSans\" because
    it sounds the same as \"LuxSans\" if you pronounce the X the right way.\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe it's not at all related to Lux Sans"

    Sans</a> and substituted the \xBBc\xAB with a \xBBz\xAB. Forgers do such things

  body: "AFAIK, <strong>LuzSans</strong> or <strong>Luz Sans</strong> (I've seen written
    it both ways) is an exclusive HP corporate font, created by <strong>[[http://typography.com/|Hoefler
    & Frere-Jones]]</strong>. It is also known as <strong>HP New Futura</strong>.\r\n\r\nObviously,
    the closest possible match is <strong>Futura</strong>."

  body: Hmm. That font is surprisingly close to the one called "Sans Serif FLF" in
    <a href="http://typophile.com/node/43147">this thread</a>.

  body: "Here is a quick sample of Sans Serif FLF Book. The letters \"j\", \"B\",
    \"U\" and the x height differ but there is a common inspiration (called Futura,
    of course).\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SansSerifFLF_5567.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
    fact, can you see any difference between the above sample and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/futura-nd/light/\">Futura
    ND</a>?\r\n\r\n[EDIT] Sorry, I had already checked... The \"M\" at least differs
    (and that's the letter that had caught my attention...)."
