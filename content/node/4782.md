  Renaissance Antiqua B over at the Elsner &#43; Flake website? &#40;Both are also
  listed at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/zapf-renaissance/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/zapf-renaissance/</a>.&#41;
  <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    version? <BR> <BR>Perhaps. The characters in the H fonts are slightly narrower
    &#40;and there is less space between them&#41;. However, the strokes in the H
    fonts also seem to be a tiny bit thicker or darker &#40;which is unusual in a
    display typeface&#41;. <BR> <BR>Any other ideas?'

    at FS Benelux &#40;I don&#39;t know if they still do&#41; used a similar  <BR>denomination:
    Sh for Supertype Headlines and Sb for Supertype  <BR>Body. They featured adapted
