  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings Typophilers, just wanted to let you know about the documentary I'm making.

<strong>Helvetica</strong> is a feature-length independent film about typography, graphic design and global visual culture. It looks at the proliferation of one typeface (which will celebrate its 50th birthday in 2007) as part of a larger conversation about the way type affects our lives. The film is an exploration of major cities and the type that inhabits them, and discussions with renowned designers about their work, their views on type, and the past fifty years of graphic design. <strong>Helvetica</strong> was shot in high-definition on location in the United States and across Europe. The film is currently in post-production and will begin screening at film festivals worldwide in early 2007. 

Interviewees in the film include Matthew Carter, Massimo Vignelli, Erik Spiekermann, Michael Bierut, Wim Crouwel, Hermann Zapf, Stefan Sagmeister, Jonathan Hoefler, Tobias Frere-Jones, Lars Müller, Rick Poynor, Experimental Jetset, Pierre Miedinger, and many more. The film will also feature an original soundtrack with new music from Sonic Youth, Sam Prekop, Kim Hiorthøy, and others. 

For more info, there's now a website for the film: http://www.helveticafilm.com

I'll also be screening a four-minute teaser at TypeCon this week, during Wednesday night's Typophile Film Festival. Hope to meet those of you who are attending. 

Looking forward to hearing all your thoughts and feedback on the film, and of course screening it all over the place in '07. We're currently finishing the editing process, and will be posting some clips and trailers on the site soon. If you'd like me to keep you posted about the film's progress, screenings and other news, we have a <a href="http://www.helveticafilm.com/mailing.html">mailing list</a> so if you're interested, get on it. 

Thanks!

-Gary

I'm looking forward to seeing it already! When is it likely to be released in the UK (we usually lag way behind the USA when it comes to release dates)?

Nice badges, by the way! Where did you get them?

First sorry for going off-topic - I though it was exciting that typophile general discussions was about to click over to 30,000 posts, shouldn't have sidetracked the thread. 

Anyway, I note that the site mentions Apple, but did you visit Apple and film any of the font folk over there?

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Si, no worries. That is weird that it's still stuck though!

Well there was talk about interviewing Steve Jobs for the film... but it never went anywhere. But then so many of the designers we interviewed referenced the Apple/Mac influence on Helvetica's popularity, and its affect on graphic design in general, that we figured the point had been made. 

Thanks again,

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">One of the challenges putting this film together was my desire not to make it a standard talking-head film, where dozens of people chime in with one quote about the subject. I wanted each interview to be a mini-profile, so you're getting to spend a few minutes with, say, Matthew Carter, learning about his background, his views on type, what he tells people when they ask him what he does for a living, etc. And then you get his views about Helvetica. The downside of this approach is that I could only include so many people in the film. There are hundreds of people who've got an opinion about the typeface, or were in some way responsible for its popularity.

It's funny because I originally wanted to make a documentary about type design, past/present/future. Then I realized that it would take a loooong time, like 3 to 5 years at least, to make a film that really covered all that and got it right. So I thought "Well, I'll just pick one typeface, that'll be easy!" 

But of course, I was wrong!

I'm slightly curious, because, like two other mostly teutonic products, the VW bug and the Beatles ;), it was not until they were hits in America that they gained world culture status. Helvetica becoming a hit here depended on Mike Parker bringing it to America, and Marva Warnock bringing it to DTP. So, it sounds like you presenting "the greatest story ever told", without the involvement of  St. Peter or Mary Magdalene ;)

Arial has been included with Mac OS since OS9 and is also very common in Linux installations, so you're about five years too late.

David, can you point us to an article, or better yet tell us the story behind this? I'd always imagined the font as being smuggled into the country along with a hoard of Nazi gold, the original Mona Lisa, and various alien artifacts by a group of unscrupulous Swiss art dealers, aboard a decommissioned U-boat manned by the cast and crew of Casablanca. But I watch too much TV.

Have you heard of a Melbourne design studio called The Letterbox? I saw a lot of lectures by the owner, Stephen Banham, on typography when I lived there, and he also lectured at one of the universities I went to. 

Anyway, he produced a lot of work based on Helvetica, including a book mapping typefaces in the CBD of Melbourne > http://www.the-letterbox.com.au/merchandise/mer_bks_grand.html (of which he found Helvetica dominated). He also sells some nice t-shirts > http://www.the-letterbox.com.au/framesets/frames_mer_tshirts.html

Watched the film last night at the London ICA opening night. The cinema was full.

I think he may have designed those for a Japanese company... not sure though.

And thanks for going to the ICA screening!

		<div class="commentbody">Gary: Too bad you didn't get to visit Melbourne during the filming. Stephen has some really interesting work that would probably fit the film (talking without having seen it yet). I worked with Stephen Banham, of the Letterbox, teaching a post grad course in Typography, Identity & Publication Design at RMIT in Melbourne. Stephen is often misinterpreted that he hates Helvetica from his Death to Helvetica t-shirts. He even considered not reprinting them at one stage from this very reason. What Stephen is trying to make a point of is designers use of Helvetica as an easy way out of an identity design jam. Slap on Helvetica and be safe.

By the way Gary: We are thinking of holding a pre screening gathering at the Film Festival here in Bergen, Norway. Would you be interested in holding a pre screening short lecture/introduction in the mid/end of October? If interested I will start researching where we can find some funding to get you over (Probably the film festival would join forces with us; the local norwegian AIGA equivalent)</div>

You're right. Mark Jamra (who studied with Armin) pointed out the misspelling to Gary in Seattle. I don't know if Gary quite believed him or not, since this was the first time it had been mentioned.

You may be only the second to notice.
