body: As ATypI members among you might know, I have a decades-long interest in the
  work of the Dutch 1950s graphic designer &amp; artist Henk Krijger. Two years ago
  I made an ATypI presentation on his Raffia Initials and showed about half a dozen
  uses of the typeface, mostly on books he designed. I&#39;m interested in finding
  additional sightings of the initials, especially in letterpress. Anyone? <BR> <BR><img

    in the magazine I art-direct, Rap-Up. I'd love to ask you a few questions about
    the initials. My email is:\r\nian@ianlynam.com\r\nDrop me a line sometime if you
    have time.\r\n A sample spread:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rapup3_05.jpg]"

    presentation available <a href="http://www.enneson.com/public_downloads/pe/typophile/typophile_HKs_RIs.pdf">here</a>.
    It is 20MB, print and text and image extraction disabled. Please honour the copyright

  body: "Hi \r\n\r\nYou mentioned the Raffia Initialen in regard to letterpress. I
    bought a case(s) of the metal Raffia way back in the early 1980s and never received
    them. Sort of a bait and switch deal. Even switched out a press on me. Nice guy,
    just weird about material things. It just so happens that a couple of days ago
    I discovered that much of the material involved may have recently ended up with
    a very good friend of mine. I'll check and see if the Raffia was included. If
    so, maybe I can plead a case. A very remarkable typeface.\r\n\r\nVery very nice
    presentation by the way. Thank you.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\nThe Bieler Press\r\nhttp://BielerPress.blogspot.com"

  body: "Gerald and H\xE9ctor, thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nGerald, I have only
    seen letterpress Raffia once. Kay Amert, Director of the Typography Laboratory
    at the University of Iowa, brought the electrotype sample <a href=\"http://www.enneson.com/public_downloads/pe/typophile/galvano_op_loden_voet.pdf\">here</a>
    to ATypI Vancouver, where I got it scanned and had Jim Rimmer make a letterpress
    impression on a piece of cardboard stiffener. Presumably the set was bought by
    Harry Duncan, the first Director, who according to Robert Bringhurst, also admired
    the initials.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you find.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

    of the Raffia Initials in use, preferably in letterpress or fine printing. This
    time it's for an essay request. \r\n\r\nAlso, I wonder if there is anyone out
    there who has done historical work on 'cadels' / 'lettres cadeaux\u2019 (see page
    60) of the pdf at the link in the 18 febreuary 2006 message above."

    I also am aware that this is a really old thread.\r\n\r\nThe raffia initials are
    actually used in J. Vondel's \"Lucifer\", published by The Rose in Utrecht. If
    I'm correct the initials were designed especially for this book. Moreover, the
    illustrations and typography in this book were done by my grandfather.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're looking for more information, please contact me on wouter.krijger@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nKind
