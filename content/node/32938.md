body: "BdD - Bram de Does' Monograph\r\n\r\nI have started reading this over the weekend
  and even though I am not done with it I am already interested in hearing some opinions
  of the book - and failing that of the typefaces. I am holding mine back for now
  because of course I am still reading... But I do have some general questions/obsorvations
  to make \r\n\r\nAll the translated dutch texts on type I have come into contact
  with so far have had an informal/andecdotal style. Is this a general trend in writen
  dutch or is it a type culture thing? Or am I mistaken? I have invented some possible
  reasons for this but that's what they are inventions. Can anyone comment on this?\r\n\r\nThe
  book so far has been very much about the physical result of printing - the paper,
  the ink, the binding, the cloth - in short : the actual physical object. I think
  that's pretty keen. It makes me interested to hear about materials+type all the
  more. "

    tell from the Dutch what is meant?

    that De Does is coining a term, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, in contrast to <em>incunable</em>
    \ -- or, more commonly, <em>incunabulum</em> (<em>incunabula</em> = plural).\r\n\r\nIf
    \"incunabula\" refers to books from the very infancy of printing, then De Does
    is joking that his <cite>Typefoundries</cite> might be called an \"excunable\"
    -- a book from the very twilight days of printing -- utilizing, as it did, already
    outmoded methods of production at such a large scale.\r\n\r\nI don't read Dutch,
    but a little sleuthing yielded the original passage. You have to go back to p.
    84:\r\n\r\n\"De <cite>Typefoundries</cite> noemt hijzelf wel schertsend een 'excunabel'.
    Het was namelijk al in 1976 heel bijzonder zo'n omvangrijke handelsuitgave (477
    p.) met de hand te zetten.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: "De Does' use of 'excunabel' appears to mean: a book printed after 1501, but
    put together with the same care and amount of work of books printed before 1501.
    A bit tongue in cheek, but typical of his way of expressing himself.\r\n\r\nBTW
    In Holland the graphic arts have a long tradition of being formost in the 'elevation
    of the working class', being unionized very early on. Lectures and self study
    groups were very common amongst printers, typesetters, etc. in the early 1900's.
    This aura of 'intellectualism' has stuck. \r\n"

  body: "I found several errors and corrected them today. I also changed the added
    to the text a bit.\r\n\r\nI have finnished the book now and have to say I am very
    impressed with the book & glad I have it! But I would like to describe what it
    contents are like a little for folks who are thinking of buying it because it's
    not a cheap book so it's not an easy thing to decide to buy without enough info.
    I couldn't find enough info about it before I bought it and wished that I could
    at the time. I also admit I was hoping for more type centered thinking/detail
    than I found in the book! Maybe some old style type-culture reticence is at work
    here. In any even here is my review:\r\n\r\nBdD is not in any way a how-to book,
    or an academic book or a book about type in any direct way. Therefore it's not
    a book about Trint\xE9 or Lexicon as type ( although they are important secondary
    subjects ) so much as it is a biography, a character study and sets the real world
    context for Bram's work. There are some observations made in it that will be helpful
    for type designers and some observations can be much better made as a result of
    looking the images & thinking about what's being said but again it is far from
    being a type design oriented or in any way a didactic book. \r\n\r\nIt's form
    is series of longer & shorter pieces all of which that take an informal tone that
    ranges from that of a magazine article to that of a letter or perhaps an email.
    Each of these has been suplemented nicely with images relevant to the story, ideas,
    or observations in question. Unfortunately & fortunately there is some repetition
    in topics. Unfortunately because I would have wished for more insight into Bram's
    choices, process, thinking etc re: type. I wanted more info about his design decisions.
    But fortunately too because some of the material that is there is further fleshed
    out and enriched because of the multiple perspectives provided.\r\n\r\nWhat I
    came away from the book with was a strong sense that the reason for Trint\xE9
    & Lexicon's existence had everything to do with the physical and visual result
    on paper that Bram was seeking. So it was not a Font or Type that BdD had in mind
    in designing Trint\xE9 or Lexicon but a result specific to a printing process,
    paper, ink and even to some extent down even to the specific company & pressmen.
    The fonts were mearely a means an end - that end being the ability to produce
    a book with a complex series of definite qualities.\r\n\r\nThis profound context
    or use centeredness is of course not a new idea, it is actually THE old idea when
    it came to metal type, and It's what Erik Spiekermann has spoken about as well
    ( paraphrasing too loosly: type designed without a purpose in mind is a bad idea
    / type designed to a specific context is a good idea ). But what different here
    is that in BdD the context of a book, a specific kind of book, is dwelled on at
    length and the process and evolution of thought that led up to Bram's outlook
    and then the fonts Trint\xE9 & Lexicon is exposed bit by bit over the course of
    the text. In some ways reading BdD leaves you in the position of an odd kind of
    detective - one who can only read the stories left by others and who cannot ask
    questions of your own.\r\n\r\nTies & Bert: Thank you for the additional specificity!\r\n\r\nBTW
    - Have either of you read this book? \r\n\r\nIf anybody has additional comments
    about what I wrote or the book itself I would love to hear what you have to say."

    books during the period of the latter half of the 15th century, from the beginning
    of Western printing up to Aldus. Basically meaning, \"of the cradle.\" Neruda's
    famous take, \"out of the cradle, endlessly rocking.\" \r\n\r\nThe standardization
    that the Aldine work brought to bear essentially ended the rather dramatic transformation
    and evolution of type during this period. Nothing quite like that has ever occurred
    again. Incunbular ends with Manutius.\r\n\r\nGerald"
