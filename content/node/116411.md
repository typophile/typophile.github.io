body: I have been looking for this font for a day. The closest match is New Caledonia,
  but there are certain details that differ. I will be glad if you can help me out.

  body: It's possible that the base font <em>was</em> New Caledonia, and that the
    designer has then modified the outlines in small ways to produce the finished
    logo. For example, that lower-case 'b' might have been edited to make it smoother.
