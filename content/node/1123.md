  body: I love where you&#39;ve gone with this already. You have done an excellent
    job humanizing the logo, which makes it very personal. There are definitely some
    spacial and weight issues with the lettering, but I&#39;m so attached to the living,
    breathing human nature of it that I&#39;m inclined to ignore any specific comments
    for change. <BR> <BR>In order to avoid a complete copout, I guess I wouldn&#39;t
    mind seeing some of the shapes from the dog illustration introduced in the lettering
    &#40;i.e. rounded white shapes from eyes, nose and ear being mirrored in the &#34;R&#39;s&#34;,
    &#34;B&#34; and/or &#34;A&#34; counters&#41;. Also, there is a weight relationship
    between the dogs head and body and the legs and tail. It appears that you may
    have already tried to incorporate some similar weight relationship between the
    Perro and Urbano words, but I think this can be pursued a little more. Maybe even
    between the weight within each letter. <BR> <BR>Good luck! Again, I like where
    this is going. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: Hi isa <BR> <BR>i understand what you are trying to do with the legibility
    of the typeface y but i have to recognize that i love the dripping character of
    the first one, it fits very well with your dog illustration and has a kind of
    graffitti style, like qe say down here, you seconf typeface is less &#34;quiltro&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>good luck <BR> <BR>Cristian <BR> <BR>by the way, i love your PU ligature on
    the first post

  body: Cristian <BR>Si bien es cierto el segundo es menos quiltro que el primero
    tienes que pensar que es mucho mas legible que el primero. <BR>Ahora, empezamos
    un nuevo y &#34;clasico&#34; tema de discusion. <BR>cuanta legibilidad estas dispuesto
    a tranzar por la expresi

  body: The first one looks and smells like a Santiago suburban stray doggy, and is
    very cute, and vernacular.  <BR> <BR>The only issue is that some characters of
    the first and BETTER design, needs a bit of legibility clean up, but just a bit.
    <BR> <BR>About the last sketch, maybe work in for nice and clean type house dogs
    from the netherlands... like Dolly. <BR> <BR>Keep the eye on the first. <BR>Arf.

    I am not trying to  <BR>insult anyone with my non-existant spanish. <BR> <BR>BTW
    The first one might be percieved as more street or urban, but the second one has
    more <BR>approachability and friendliness.
