  body: 'Pirulen is actually a font family of 12 styles and the regular weight has
    always been free (for personal use), thanks to Ray Larabie. You can download this
    free weight from several online sources (DaFont) or directly on MyFonts (Regular
    0$). These are exactly the same version and are all copyrighted to Typodermic
    Ray Larabie. So, of course, no stolen version, illegal material or encouragement
    to piracy. '
