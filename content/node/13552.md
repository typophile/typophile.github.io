  typefounding agglomeration formed in 1892, eventually containing most of the American
  typefounding industry. In the 1890s, sorting through the libraries that were merged
  in and deciding what to keep and what to get rid of was handled by [[Joseph W. Phinney]].
  ATF's early success owed quite a bit to the technical genius of [[Linn Boyd Benton]],
  inventor of the pantographic engraver. Ultimately, ATF owned the rights to one of
  the world\u2019s greatest libraries of original typefaces, with many of the ATF-era
  designs created by Linn Boyd Benton's son, [[Morris Fuller Benton]].\r\n\r\nFoundries
  that were incorporated into ATF include: [[Barnhart Brothers and Spindler|Barnhart
  Brothers & Spindler]] (1911); [[Binny & Ronaldson]] (1892); [[Boston Type Foundry]]
  (1892); [[Bruce Type Foundry]] (1901); [[Central Type Foundry]] (1893); [[Dickinson
  Type Foundry]] (1892); [[Farmer, Little & Co.]] (1892); [[Inland Type Foundry]]
  (1912).\r\n\r\nBy the 1920s ATF was the dominant player in the world\u2019s printing
  equipment market. Not just fonts, but entire printing plants were on offer. This
  strong position did not continue, due to the ever-changing nature of the printing
  industry. In 1934 ATF reorganized under bankruptcy protection, and never regained
  its former glory. The company failed to keep up in the phototype era, and failed
  completely in the digital era.\r\n\r\nKingsley, a manufacturer of imprinting and
  marking equipment, acquired ATF in 1986, and the type division became [[Kingsley/ATF
  Type Corporation]]. The foundry closed in 1993 with an ingnominious backruptcy auction.
  These days the only sign of ATF fonts is in licensing deals with experienced digital
  foundries such as [[Bitstream]] and [[Adobe]]."
