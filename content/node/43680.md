body: "In my typography class, we have to \"Comp\" a paragraph.. (it's like finding
  out how many words/characters there are before Microsoft Word was invented LOL)
  \r\n\r\nANyway, is there a good tutorial on how to do this on the net somewhere?
  \r\n\r\nPerhaps with pictures.. easy to understand.. \r\n\r\nMy book doesnt explain
  it very well, and my class is hybrid format and i dont really have a teacher.. \r\n\r\nHere's
  what the assignment says..\r\n\r\n\"Comping - Due- April 2 \r\n\r\nLine Length =
  36 picas \r\nComp Garamond; 60 pts; uppercase \r\nComp the paragraph on Page 28
  as 12/18\" \r\n\r\nwe got some tracing paper and this transparency-ruler thing with
  points, inches, and picas on it... \r\n\r\nand this part in my book says... \r\n\"When
  comping text type, you need only suggest the lines of type, not render each individual
  word.. \"\r\n\r\nand then for Comping Display Type... it says.. \r\n\"When comping
  display type, you must carefully trace each letter so the copy is readable and the
  typeface is recognizable.. \"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's apparently an old way of doing something
  that became obsolite after computers were invented.. \r\n\r\nbut i cant find ANY
  info about it on the net at all >_<\r\n\r\nThanks ^^"

    Text Type\" (it's page 128) and now, slowly move your eyes to the left. No, no,
    stop! Look under your thumb. Yes, way over to the left column. Figure 2. See?
    That's a comped paragraph. \r\n\r\nOk, so I'm a total wise ass. Oh well.\r\n\r\nHere
