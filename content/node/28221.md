  for their footnotes. It's seems quite strange and surprisingly unconventional. I'm
  wondering whether it has been designed especially to be legible at very small sizes,\r\ncheers,
  thanks for the help\r\n\r\nNick"

  body: A wonderful alt, Geoff. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?did=2224">Akemi
    Aoki</a> is one of the great unknown type designers. Her stuff has so much life
    and charm, and unlike many "bouncy" types, hers are more tasteful than tacky.

  body: "Hey nice work! Thanks very much. Does anyone know if it's specifically for
    very small settings? \r\n\r\nESV stands for English Standard version BTW, it's
    a relatively new version which blends literallness with readibility, s'good\r\nthanks
    again\r\n\r\n--N"

  body: As it's in the "Myriad Wild" set, I assume it's specifically for "fun" settings.
    I would never have expected to see it set small in a serious context like this.

  body: "Yeah exactly,\r\n\r\nand that's what inspired my curiosity...the only thing
    I could come up with was, perhaps the exaggerated and flared strokes aid in readability
    at small sizes, it does work and I was a while reading before I noticed the irregularity"
