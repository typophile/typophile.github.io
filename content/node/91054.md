body: Does anybody know a way (likely through a font creator or editor program) where
  I can trick the font into thinking it's a different point size? Basically, I am
  working with Helvetica Neue, and it happens to be a very large font. I want the
  pull down menu in whatever program I'm using to display a 12pt as 10pt, for example.
  Even though it's truly a 12pt font, it is reading out as a 10pt font. Is there any
  way to reset the point size designations in a font so that it displays different
  designated point size numbers?

    to a larger number would be an easy way to shrink how the font appears. \r\nI
    suppose you should check the EULA to see if such adjustment is allowed by the
    license."

    body: It's complicated, but basically I work for an insurance company with a Compliance
      Department, and they have an arbitrary regulation that says all body copy needs
      to be in 12pt. That is way too huge and creates gaudy, ugly design for the marketing
      materials. The way they check this is to open up my PDF in Acrobat and check
      the Properties. If I can have the Properties read 12pt (when in reality the
      font is 10pt) that is the goal. These people know nothing of typography and
      I'm sick of their stupid regulations deciding my designs.

  body: Sometimes organizations (eg, schools) require text to be set in a certain
    point size, in a certain font. This makes it easy to compare the lengths of documents
    at a glance.

    Seems to create more problems than solutions, doesn't it?

    if the specs tell you to create something at legal size (8 1/2 x 11\"), create
    it at 10.2 x 13.2\".\r\nThen use your font at 12pt (which is what the Properties
    will show). When printing to the intended page size, select \"Scale to Fit\" in
    the printing dialog. Of course you must be printing to the intended paper size.\r\n\r\nIf
    you say, \"well, won't they notice the page size is larger?\", I can ask the same
    thing about using a smaller font size than requested.\r\n\r\n(Without <em>clearly</em>
    cheating like this, about the only real option I can think of is scale down an
    otherwise perfectly good Helvetica with a good font editor that will not screw
    up any of the size related font measurements and features, as there are spacing
    or kerning.)"

    from the state or federal government? If it is, trying to evade it by twiddling
    the font is the kind of thing that could get your employer in serious legal trouble,
    and you fired.\r\n\r\nI recently consulted for one of the ten largest companies
    in the US on essentially this exact same issue. Somebody somewhere along the way
    screwed up\u2014possibly because they decided they were above some silly \u201Carbitrary
    regulation\u201D\u2014and they are now facing litigation about the type allegedly
    not being big enough in a standardized letter they send out.\r\n\r\nI also was
    once consulted by the San Diego DA's office on a similar case. It was marketing
    materials, but there was indeed a legal requirement around point size. Unfortunately
    the malefactors came up with a very clever way to deke out the requirement, which
    I won't repeat here (though I will probably cover it in my talk at Typo SF). But
    suffice it to say I told the DA's office they were out of luck.\r\n\r\nIn other
