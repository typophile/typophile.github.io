  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I’m working on a typeface titled New Constructivist. The design was inspired by a logo I designed for an exhibit of Malevich’s work, which I built around his notion that the square could be the basic building block of non-objective art. My goal with New Constructivist is to create an original font using Malevich’s ideas rather than creating a revival of old Cyrillic designs. If you want to compare my font with existing fonts my letters are most similar to <cite>P22 Constructivist Square</cite>, but designed as new Latin letters with no attempt to get a Cyrillic feel or to mimic any specific existing design. Eventually I plan to expand this to a three weight set; Light, Normal, and Black; depending on what I do with black a bold may appear as well.</p>
<p>v 0.1 - All letters, numbers, and some punctuation of the normal weight are drawn. Almost no spacing tweaks or metrics are implemented.

I started trying to build all of the letters within a square, but ended up with the old Pac-Man arcade lettering. At that point I started over by building on a grid of squares and narrowing some of the letters that I did not feel needed to be especially wide. These letters are recreations of another update that I did by hand; now I am finding that what made sense in pencil does not work so well in Postscript.</div>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the most original typeface you are making, but that is not really too much a problem, as long as you give it your own spin. So, maybe you can get some ideas or inspiration by seeing how others made constructivist-inspired typefaces. :)</p>

<p>I used a grid for <a href="http://dezcom.com/Weimaraner.png">Weimar Plakat, my constructivist face</a> and it worked fine but you have to spend a lot of time determining what the grid is. It is not an even number of squares.</p>

The latest version has been added as a PDF to the original post.</p>
<p>I have made the widths wider overall, and everything is much more consistent in terms of size. At this point I am starting to integrate tapers into the letterforms to give the whole thing a personality that’s a little more contemporary, although that may get ditched if things start getting too humanist.</p>
<p>I am also thinking about creating a slightly rounded set in the vein of old woodblock letters that were designed to be worn down without losing their basic look. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>VERY nice improvements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo; don&rsquo;t look like they&rsquo;d be of the same style. &ldquo;X&rdquo; also has weight problems. It looks too thin to me. Similar style problems are with &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;N&rdquo; but maybe any change make them less readable. I only want you to reconsider the shapes of these.</p>
<p>Definitely change &ldquo;K&rdquo; because right now you have a vertically mirrored letter and it looks very strange and unstable. Try designing it with horizontal bar in the middle (see Eurostile&rsquo;s &ldquo;K&rdquo; for reference). This will make it look more of the same style. And leg will have to go a bit more to the right to stabilize the letter.</p>
<p>I like very much what you did to &ldquo;D&rdquo; and &ldquo;W&rdquo;. Did you also try to change the &ldquo;M&rdquo; a bit.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re trying to distinguish between &ldquo;O&rdquo; and &ldquo;0&rdquo; (zero), but maybe the difference is too huge, because zero looks much narrower compared to other numbers.</p>
<p>Try to change &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;G&rdquo; to be similar to &ldquo;D&rdquo; (slanted lines)</p>
<p>Tapers work very nice. Keep on. It&rsquo;s going on very nice.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As I’m sure some of you heard at Typecon, I lost a lot of the files for this one when my laptop was stolen due to not backing up properly—that’s what I get for not double-checking the tarballs! Fortunately I was able to get just about everything back by extracting the embedded font from the PDF specimens I had floating around, and I’ve been making a lot of little tweaks this week to the letters and numbers, I plan to rework the punctuation next.</p>
<p>Right now I’m still having a lot of trouble with X, Y, D and G. I am also removing about removing all of the tapers, as I feel that they clas with the constructivist ideas behind the design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the feedback Ricardo. What do you mean by a crossbar? Different weights on the strokes?</p>
<p>I’m tempted to redraw the W and the M a strokewidth or two wider to make the interiors work a little better. I’ve got a lot of letters to draw this weekend, so I’ll work those in.</p>
<p>And as for the tapers, I think the best way to settle this will be to work them into the whole font and see how it works.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey, James.</p>
<p><em>What do you mean by a crossbar?</em></p>
<p>The horizontal line in the letter H, for example. So I&rsquo;m suggesting that you work in a horizontal line into those other letters, K, X and Y &ndash; to give them a boxier look, I suppose. Of course, that may make them hard to tell from other letters, so you have to tread carefully. But maybe the tapering will keep that from happening.</p>
<p>Oh, and I&rsquo;m sorry to hear about your laptop. :-(</p>
<p><em>I’m tempted to redraw the W and the M a strokewidth or two wider to make the interiors work a little better.</em></p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a great idea. As Stephen and Tiffany said earlier, departing from the grid can be good.  :-)</p>
