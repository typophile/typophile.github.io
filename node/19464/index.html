But for everyone of you who want to get to know each other a bit better (and is interested in the question like me): the what are you listening to, when you are working thread!?
And do you get inspired by the music!?
First answer by myself:
At the moment I am listening to amusing 70s and 80s soul. Maybe because I am working on a happy looking revival mix of cooper black and goudy heavyface. Well, I should better listen to beach boys I think :)

<div class=commentbody>I'm currently obsessed with the new cds by Gregory and the Hawk, Marit Larson, NOFX, and Nickel Creek. Also The Waitresses, Phil Ochs, Devildriver, Ephel Duath, The Rentals, and Regina Spektor. Pretty all over the place.
<cite>Hmmm, gonna have to put the skip on Deicide.</cite>
Death metal usually throws a wrench into the whole shuffle thing. I like to make playlists by genre/mood and shufffle inside those.

<div class=commentbody>4'33" lol. I work mostly in silence since the lyrics of most songs distract me from the words I'm dealing with in my work.
However, on the subway, on the iPod, in addition to earlier mentions: Patti Smith, Damien Rice, Golden Palominos, Beck's Guero and Guerolito (altho I can't BELIEVE he's a scientologist!), Decemberists, Franz Ferdinand (anyone else think they sound a lot like Frankie Goes to Hollywood?), Fiona Apple, Marc Ribot, MC 900 Ft.

<div class=commentbody>quote - I work mostly in silence since the lyrics of most songs distract me from the words I’m dealing with in my work.
I agree with you. So I tend to listen to instrumental music or music with lyrics in foreign languages. I'm big on Gypsy music from just about everywhere, and also non-techno ambient music. Classical is also a very nice thing to design to…

I agree. I use classical if I need help to concentrate or if I'm writing something. Different kind of music for different kind of jobs.
Pop/rock is good for Photoshop work.</div>

I have to be careful not to sing along when the bass arias come on. A strange bald guy singing Don Giovanni arias alone in a crowded subway is not a pretty sight :-)

Actually, you are probably just smarter than me but it seems like too much thought for music listening. I can honestly tell you that my least least least favorite part of music is theory. I hate it. I bet slash couldn't even read music, but he is one of the greatest musicians ever recorded and distributed. I am not knocking the person who wrote that, but it seems a bit "gay."

<div class=commentbody>Anyone of you saw White Stripes!? They had such a nice stage. So lovely designed.
The whole stage and the equipment was painted in red.
http://images.freemusic.cz/koncerty/whitestripes/12.jpg
On every side of the stage were hanging very nice banners.
http://sophiejarryonstageandback.neufblog.com/photos/uncategorized/the_white_stripes_zenith_paris_sjarry2.jpg
They had also real palms painted in white on their stage. Nice Carpets everywhere on the ground. Many kitschy stuff, like cuckoo clocks, those little hawaian girls puppies that dances to the sound of the music. The whole area looked like a beautiful red livingroom. I wish my room were so comfortable.
And by the way: The music and the show was breathtaking. I wonder how 2 people could entertain a hall so much.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Some misc. great music:
Anyone courageous enough for something different in a foreign language, I can recommend anything you can get by Maria Dolores Pradera (from the Canary Islands). One of the richest voices in the history of mankind.
And there are some incredible performances by Om Kolthom (Egypt), if you can get an ear for Arabic scales and instrumentation. Otherwise it is music to drive away unwanted houseguests. Few westerners are capable of enjoying this, but if you are feeling adventurous...
Anything by Rhonda Vincent (killer bluegrass)
Unforgettable by Terumasa Hino (standards by a Jazzman from Japan playing a cornet)
Brad Paisley's guitar licks on Time Warp from the new CD (left me speechless) will confirm country musicians are stepping up to the plate as far as chops go.
Some raw, heart-wrenching Mexican rancheras for those not offended by anything Mexican, can be found on the early works of Chavela Vargas. Later on she lost a lot due to excessive tequila drinking, I think.</div>

In the pop/rock vein: David Gray, Coldplay, Wilco and Neil Finn get consistent play. But I've been listening to Joanna Newsom all day (heard one of her songs on an animated short here at the Nashville Film Festival on Saturday. Very interesting stuff (link to a quicktime video if you're interested).

i have never seen the white stripes in concert, but it's something my lady and i want to do next time they are in town. we have one of their DVDs (under blackpool lights) and it totally rocks! i have all their albums and they seriously are one of my favorite bands.
a speaker at the Y conference recently told us that she had a theory about all graphic designers secretly wishing they were rock stars. i'd say the white stripes are rock stars who secretly want to be graphic designers! (i mean that in the BEST possible way!)

<div class=commentbody>The first Grandmaster Flash 12" single was a revelation. Incredible…
Fela had a big influence on James Brown. When he returned from his trip to Africa in the late 60s, his music became more political…
BTW - my forebearers are mostly Mormons. My great-great uncle had 16 wives. Always wondered about that. One is more than enough for me… :)

<div class=commentbody>I am listening to Public Radio being taken over by commercial interests and yet ask for sponsorship from their listeners. An example: This weather forcast is brought to you by (corporation) and maybe a description of their product or services. Another: Our arts relationship with (corporation, or club) presenting (artist) you can get tickets by calling…. Then in the next breathe: we can't do it without listeners like you, become a member. The non profits have more commercials per hour than commercial radio. So sad</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dan,
Our public radio station here sent out a survey saying they were thinking of dumping classical music and going more talk crap instead (note my hint of bias). There was a outcry of NO! from far and wide. I sent them several letters of protest telling them if they dumped classical music my donation days were over.
The next week they dumped classical music. The next day I got a request for donation. The next day I wrote another hot note. The nextweek I got another request for donation for their "new improved format". The next day I sent a hot email and will never send the bums another dime.

<div class=commentbody>Has anyone heard of a film called Sahara Blue? Well, the soundtrack is something mind blowing. It's composed by Hector Zazou and lyrics are actually poems by Rimbaud. Cannot guarantee you will be able to listen to that AND do some work at the same time though. It's part in French, some songs are in Arabic and some in English...it would be nice to know if someone here knows it.
Otherwise I love Amy Winehouse and Aimee Mann and Elliot Smith (loads)... </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hector Zazou is playing here in LA with Peter Buck, Fred Chalemor, Matt Chamberlain, Robert Fripp and Bill Rieflin. The project is called Slow Music.
There's an amazing film that tells the story of the Gypsies through music. It's called Latcho Drom. It starts in India and works it's way into jazz, etc…
Really beautiful film. I have the soundtrack and you can rent it at my local video store.
There's an amazing segment with Taraf de Haidouks where an old man is playing the violin. He has stripped all the horse hairs off of the bow except one. It is the most haunting sound…

<div class=commentbody>I don't know if this makes sense. I mean, everyone says what's listening to while working, but they do the same on music forums.
What was interesting was the association proposed at the thread's beginning: what's the relationship between your design and the music you relate to it.
Personally I did often in the past the opposite: I played certain things as I worked on early creative stages of alphabets. I recall I did it with Neoritmo: since the face was a destructured/restructured approach to the classic lapidary/roman framework, I played alternatively traditional rock and pop, as well as things evocating the Roman Empire in modern context. Examples which could apply:
Killing Joke - Rubicon (and the whole "Brighter…" album)
Iggy Pop - American Caesar
Psychic TV - Slur
Sigue Sigue Sputnik - How do U Dream Little Caesar
Morcheeba - Rome Wasn't Built in A Day
Anthrax - American Pompeii
Culture - Roman Soldiers of Babylon
and so on…
I did the same with a face I have not released as well, recently. The thing is very very destructured and meant to convey a sense of the future, so I played an album I just discovered (in 2004), which is The Human League's debut album "Reproduction" from 1979.
If you are used to the "crappy" pop done by Phil Oakley in mid-1980s you should check the original first two albums of the band, which convey an unsurpassed sense of "the future".
"Black Celebration" by Depeche Mode would have been equally suited. A masterpiece of a concept album. Considered it's from 1986, it's optimistic considered what we live right now.</div>

<div class=commentbody>BTW, I think music while you work is better suited in stages of repetitive tasks, or less creative ones.
And of course you should be working alone (like in type design at home). I can't stand music, talking, noise et al, where I work. It's almost a nightmare, since I can't concentrate, so music becomes the opposite: a force of hindrance.</div>

<div class=commentbody>There is a fund drive coming up at this non profit Jazz station, now tell me if this isn't as or more commercial than a commercial station selling soap. Along with the sponsorship ads for every news reports and the constant begging for listener support, now they are asking for local businesses to donate food and beverages. Well what happens is after the fund drive they advertise those businesses until the next fund drive. So most of an hour is dedicated to raising funds. I get more music from my commercial classical station WQXR who is owned by the New York Times than WBGO. Sad</div>

<div class=commentbody><a href=http://www.dephazz.com/ target=_blank>De Phazz!</a>
With broadband, I've found my CDs gathering dust. I have a "VIP" subscription to <a href=http://www.live365.com target=_blank>Live365.com</a> -- very cheap, like just a few bucks a month! And if something comes along I like, I investigate further via P2P. And if I really, really like it, I may even buy a copy eventually.
Anyway, on Live365, you can do keyword searches and make your own playlist. Some of the "stations" are just a few hours looped, but others update pretty frequently. Type in "mozart" or "soul" or "gogos" and see what comes up!
Genres? From artful 50s/60s jazz I've branched out to that whole new realm of nu jazz, chill, trip-hop, etc. De Phazz is my new favorite thing. Indian classical is great for working-- being an ignorant Westerner, I don't get caught up in any "meaning" that may be there-- it just lets my brainwaves float along. And that's really the key for most working music-- just enough to move the brain along, without "knowing" too much of what I'm hearing.
And sometimes silence is golden.</div>

Yes I have it spelled both ways on CDs. (forgot to mention that)
Kudos for being able to "grok" it.
Btw, as best I can make out, when she does something particularly moving, and you hear the audience break into applause, apparently it was customary to then repeat that section as sort of an immediate encore. This probably being a factor in each CD containing only one song.
One I can recommend is the "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam". </div>

About the graphic designers secretly wishing they were rock stars theory. In Germany there is a dj(The Frank Popp Ensemble) who is a graphic designer and in his contract he has the clause that every artwork has to be done by himself. Some nice works, I think.

<div class=commentbody>Hi 'Ya All:
I definitely have different tastes from most of you guys here. The genres I listen to while working (creating graphics) are:
Underground Disco, Deep House, Jazzy House, Classic House, Disco House, (I really love all shades of house), Bossa Nova, Afro-Beat, lots of electronic down-tempo, and some strange pop tracks thrown in for fun!
Songs and artists rocking my world:
Flunk- Blue Monday (Blue States Remix)
I:Cube- Disco Cubism (Daft Punk Remix)
Grace Jones - La Vie en Rose
Royksopp- Remind Me (Tom Middleton Cosmos Mix)
Aqua Bassino- We Could Be Friends
Terra Deva- Fresh Start (House Remix)
Terra Deva- Speak Low
Aya- Uptown (Trentemoller Mix)
[re:jazz]- Donaueschingen (Andre Lodemann Club Mix)
Aquanote- Only (Weekender Vocal)
My very specials:
Daft Punk- Indo Silver Club
Lisa Shaw- Always (Lovetronic Vocal)
Martinez- Autumn Jazz Ep....every single track is fabulous
My favorite track of ALL time (featuring a gorgeous smokey atmosphere):
Dalminjo: Repetitiveness
Yes... sometimes I stop working so I can dance(or sing). I enjoy myself non-the-less and I do accomplish what I intended.
See you guys later,
Mike D
PS... And yes, all these tracks can be found on iTunes ;)</div>

I also like a daily dip into my 5- and 4-star rated Thelonious Monk, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington and Jimmy Smith tracks. (Gotta love rating tracks in iTunes).
In the non-jazz world, I'm always listening to White Stripes, Radiohead, Spiderbait, Art of Fighting, Rocket Science and They Might Be Giants. </div>

And for the days you need to do some physical work...like carrying your stuff around, mounting boards, cut stuff, put some order in your studio etc....I suggest some Henry Mancini so you can dance around at the sound of it and have some fun.

All the more enjoyable when you realize on most of his stuff he was playing bass with his feet, and track that at the same time. Some of the up-tempo things, both hands and both feet are going for it, so it gets pretty amazing.

Chet's singing style is certainly not mainstream, but I found that it grew on me. Of course some of his trumpet work is classic. </div>

Isn't it amazing how Chet's voice sounded more and more like his horn as he aged? Ever see the film "Let's get lost"? It is way out of print, but it is really good. The soundtrack is good as well if you can find it. He really does a nice version of Costello's "Almost Blue".</div>

I do love Henri Mancini too. I bought the Pink Panther's Penthouse Party cd- loved it. But I loved it so much I lost it. I miss that disc. [tears welling up]
Ultra Lounge compilations are also really good for old funky jazzy tunes. Crime Scene is da bomb. [yes i said da bomb]
By-the-way.... Does anyone listen to Jean Michel Jarre (the god father of French electronic music)??? Very deep relaxing tracks.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Lore:
Wowsers you actually saw that! I was a little kid then. But it was when I was a little kid that I first started listening to electronic music.
Do you remember the Equinoxe cd? The first track is amazing!!! And the other album I love is the one with the big yellow ear on it... I think its called Cousteau in Concert.
Liberatingly Yours,
Mikey</div>

<div class=commentbody>If you're looking for obsessive and repetitive and liberating, you might want to listen to Terry Riley "In C". It was the first minimalist classical recording released and led to Steve Reich, Phillip Glass, Laurie Anderson, John Adams and many great pieces of music. It is a classic record…
You might also want to try out Balinese Gamelan…

Many places we played gave free drinks to the band, and I was compelled to take advantage of that. Not to mention the other influences of the life-style seemed dead-endish (drugs, married women forgetting to mention the married part, etc.)
The deciding night was when one drunk asked to sing The Yellow Rose of Texas, and then proceded to bend over and sing the whole thing into the weighted end of the boom-stand. Then at the intermission another drunk walks up to the drummer and says, "Hey man, I used to play the drums." And then passed out into the middle of the kit, sending cymbals and drums rolling off in various directions, while the drummer just sat there stunned, looking at the guy laying where his drumset used to be.

<div class=commentbody>The stuff I recorded would probably only be found in a Mexican Dr. Demento show. But you can hear the guys I used to play with in Norwalk, Poncho Sanchez and the Banda Brothers: Ramon (Mon) and Tony.
They kept at it, and have been pretty successful. The break came after Poncho was asked to fill in for Cal Tjader's regular conga player, and Cal asked him to stay. When Cal died (stranding the band in Japan), Poncho was able to sign with the same label (Concord). The early versions of his band was manned by some of my college classmates.
The stories I'd hear of European tours of 11 concerts in 9 countries in 8 days (or something like that), then coming back to LA for a gig, then the same night taking a red-eye flight to Mexico for a jazz festival really scared me. It sounded grueling. On the plus side they did get to play with many of the people who were our heroes. </div>

<div class=commentbody>You list Blue Cheer as an influence? That seems strange to me in that when I lived in a trailor in Laguna Canyon, they practiced in the house right above me. They used to drive me nuts because they would jam for hours, seemingly all day, in one key (Being rock musicians, I'm guessing G). That is all I remember.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Blue Cheer was the redneck acidhead answer to the San Fran psychedelic scene. Louder. Just like the first Alice Cooper album was the alcoholic Arizonan poke in the eye to the hippies. And Roky Erikson and the 13th Floor Elevators was the Texan take…

<div class=commentbody>I was trained as a classical pianist and played Saxophone and French Horn then I found the guitar.
I started with jazz as soon as ZIggy Stardust came out.
Eventually worked my way into the avant garde: The Art Ensemble of Chicago, Muhal Richard Abrams, Cecil Taylor, etc…
Then avant garde classical music: Stockhausen, Mauricio Kagel, John Cage, etc…
Then Roxy Music and when punk rock hit I was in all the way…
It was really fun.
The great thing about those albums I mentioned is that they're not music. They're some thing beyond music. A bunch of young crazy guys with guitars and really loud amps. Rock has been absolutely vigorous from time to time…

<div class=commentbody>...Brian Ferry is considered one of the greatest Brits alive, it's amazing how he reinvented himself as an aristocrat when in fact he came from a working class background...and now his son is campaigning for fox hunting and all that. Weird stuff.

<div class=commentbody>I really liked the first four Mothers of Invention albums with "We're Only In It For The Money" being my favorite. I felt he turned on his audience after that and started talking down to them instead of with them. Just my take…
Love the Roxy Music albums with Eno and Avalon is also an amazing record!

<div class=commentbody>There is no doubt that for a short time Zappa was taken seriously by the classical community. But he didn't fall far enough from the Schoenberg tree to have a lasting impact. Don't get me wrong, lore, Frank Zappa had a tremendous effect on my life.
My favorite quote: "Quit school and go to the library"
His liner notes for Absolutely Free credited a pantheon of 20th Century composers and artists, many of whom influenced me also.
Partly because of him I had the courage to conduct my life as an autodidact…

<div class=commentbody>He has a fretless version too. Does some cool things sliding chords through changes. Unlike me, this guy is the real deal. Same with our drummer, who has toured with Jose Feliciano and other credits that escape me. The acoutic guitarist is a clinician for Martin. The electric guitarist rips too. I'm pretty much the only person doing the smoke and mirrors thing.
Well, I have to quit for a while. No way I'm taking the lead on the prolific poster list. Hmmm...

<div class=commentbody>For the last 8 years I've been designing and building instruments. I have an ensemble called International Metal Supply with a friend of mine from France. Here's some photos of the instruments:
The Buddhaphone:

The Void

We recently played at Redcat in Disney Hall doing the soundtrack for a silent film:
Kurutta Ippeiji (A Page of Madness) (1927) by Teinosuke Kinugasa
And collaborated on the soundtrack for A Darkness Swallowed by Betsy Bromberg.
It's a lot of fun and hard work building these. California is a hotbed of percussion inventors…

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Definitely. Part of music's appeal is its <strong><em>challenge</em></strong> (to both artist and audience). Music requires effective decisions between lots of variables; it must balance chaos & order, passion & logic, expectations fulfilled & thwarted, objectivity & subjectivity, humor & humorlessness, and so much more.
I think graphic design balances many of these same dynamics, as do many other artforms (and crafts).
What does everyone else think about this? Do you feel that your appreciation of music is analogous to your appreciation of design? Do you "respect" the same types of "solutions"?

<div class=commentbody>Most of my artistic viewpoints were formed by music, since I've been playing all my life. I came to design later and music will always be the deepest in my heart.
All these decisions you talk about are essentially ones philosophy. I discovered in my mid-20s that the act of playing guitar was no longer a technique, it was a philosophy. That is the same way I feel about design. I take it on faith that if I pay attention to my life and my beliefs, that my art will flourish as a result.
When you were playing that track you were not balancing all those things, you already had and you were showing us the answers that you had formulated. Thanks for the peek…

<div class=commentbody>But part of improvisation, at least for me, involves making these decisions while you play. I think musicians come to their work with a certain take on these dynamics - a taste, if you will, about how to balance them. But I certainly try to "switch gears" when playing in order to introduce variety.
Sorry if I hijacked the thread. :-)

<div class=commentbody>Interesting. I improvise to get out of here… :)
I think the most interesting thing about improvisation and life in general is the sense of time.
A good description that I heard from a friend is that improvisation is like a rubber band, when you start stretching it it is not as pliable as when you warm it up a little. The more you play the farther you can stretch and still snap back.
Like a vacation it's always good to leave, and good to return…

<div class=commentbody>I'm surrounded by mockingbirds and crows. Also quite a few hawks around here.
Mockingbirds are my favorites, they learn hundreds or songs through their life. The more they know the more they get laid. I guess I better write some new songs.
I love crows just for their Gothic presence…
And the hawks are sublime.

<div class=commentbody>Improvization provides you with an outlook that softens the shock of change. You make the best of wherever you find yourself in the changes, and if doesn't go as planned, but you work yourself out of the jam, you can pretend it was what you meant to do. This last part may be easier in music than in real life.

<div class=commentbody><em>Mockingbirds are my favorites</em>
Mine too. I had one that nested in a night-blooming jasmine tree, and I could sit in the yard and trade licks with him. He always smoked me, but it was an honor that he would play off some of my licks. And he taught me to appreciate things I hadn't got into before, like quartile riffs. One he liked to repeat was three rapid ascending fourths, then go up a half-step and do three more, then another half-step and do three more, then resolve it with a rapid minor-third trill. He'd repeat it until I whistled it right. A truely patient teacher.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The tree and the bird. The smell and the sound… wonder.
Language is such an amazing thing. We can codify what the mockingbird was singing while he's just trying to successfully propagate.
Improv. I have felt for many years that at my best I was merely grabbing music out of the air that already exists and will always exist and retransmitting it through the filter known as me.
Beethoven referred to The Music of the Spheres (after Pythagorus). If I look up at clouds passing while listening to one of his symphonies I can almost understand.

And Black Cross was one of the reasons why i bought the album. Because they didnt released it on previous studio albums. I didnt know that it is a coversong. But its great. I try to find the original song in store. So maybe you will get more royalties soon. :]

<div class=commentbody>The band that did the original was called 45 Grave. I was the lead guitarist and that was actually the first song I wrote for the band. 1981… Wow.
I heard that John Frusciante gave a radio interview where he said that was an influential song for him when he was 14 or so. Much to my good fortune all these years later they decided to cover it.
Royalties are good, especially for something you did 25 years ago.
I hope they play it too! Have fun… :)

<div class=commentbody>Today I was listening to Mrs. Miller. It was one of those so bad it's funny kind of things. It would be appropriate as background music for a catfight. Not only is her vibrato over the top, she had no sense of rhythm. Sometimes she'd start a verse two beats early and sing that whole part out of sync. Just hilarious. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000J600/sr=8-1/qid=1150336773/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6597420-3591937?%5Fencoding=UTF8" target=_blank>reviews at Amazon</a> pretty much line up with my experience.</div>

Along those lines (but a little more highbrow) I would recommend Portsmouth Sinfonia.
Brian Eno put a bunch of beginning musicians together and recorded classical music.
lore - I have a feeling that you would like <a href=http://www.danieleluppi.com/>Danielle Luppi</a> "An Italian Story". He got together the musicians from the Ennio Marconi soundtracks and cut an LP. It's pretty cool…

and if ya wanna sing along…
n this house of suffering
i gotta let some joy in
i hear that freedom will win
oh where oh where can jah love be now
my dear, it's here in the underground
inside the hearts of your own children
in this house of suffering
i spiritualogic grin, in
one way grace is my friend
to conquer doom and sin
and all the nations lying
while all our people crying
and they stop at nothing!...nothing!...nothing!
in this house of suffering
don,t want but just one thing
got to have my origin
in this house of suffering

I'll have to respectfully disagree. I'm a much bigger fan of Van Dyke Parks than Mr. Wilson, so it was right in line with what I hoped for.
Do you feel the same way about "Song Cycle"?

Sundazed has remastered this on Vinyl, which I would recommend over the available CDs that sound like mud.</div>

I'm not familiar with him, or Song Cycle, but I have always loved the Beach Boy harmonies. I much prefer the CD his kids made recently. It is sort of over-produced or something, but the harmonies are lovely.
The VDP stuff seems to be something that would go over better if one was fairly stoned. Not that I'm insinuating anything.

<div class=commentbody>VDP is a great arranger. Smoke them if you have them, but it won't make any difference.
I would be willing to bet Song Cycle is not what you might expect at all. It is arrestingly inventive, and so far outside the rawk genre as to be almost unidentifiable.
A contemporary work VDP has shaped is Rufus Wainwright's debut. Talent like that doesn't need any enhanced state to enjoy. Do youself a favor and have a listen.
