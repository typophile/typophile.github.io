body: "I just got word yesterday that \"Behind the Typeface: Cooper Black\" was one
  of the victims of YouTube's purge of 100,000 videos this week that allegedly violate
  Viacom's copyrights. (Viacom owns VH1, which owns \"Behind the Music,\" which my
  movie parodies.) When you're dealing with a number like 100,000, it's awfully difficult
  to evaluate each one on its merits. Furthermore, it's a privilege -- not a right
  -- to be on YouTube, so getting kicked off isn't something that I can get that self-righteous
  about. They don't want to be sued, and I can't really blame them, though I do think
  they could have taken a better stand than they did.\r\n\r\nHowever, as an indirect
  target of Viacom's bullying, you'd better believe that I am extremely upset that
  Viacom doesn't recognize the fair use doctrine of the U.S. Copyright Act. This is
  one more case of a giant corporation throwing its weight around just because it
  can, and I'm not willing to be a victim of it.\r\n\r\nSo I'm taking my case to the
  street. With any luck, news will spread and Viacom will get the bad press it so
  richly deserves.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to that other company that begins with V for
  its support. You guys are the best."

    otherwise. I am going to assume that they're not necessarily savvy enough to poke
    around non-YouTubian venues for similar material. Regardless, a fine pain in the
    southern cushies.

    away in the the battle among entrenched corporate interests. Now that Google owns

    don't know how well capitalized Veer is. Perhaps small enough not to attract this

    excellent talk on \"Free Culture\" which describes just this issue. See\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/policy/2002/08/15/lessig.html\r\n\r\nfor
    a transcript and a link to the Flash version of his slide presentation with him
    speaking on the audio track. (Also note his excellent and unorthodox use of PowerPoint.)
    The talk is a few years old but I'm sure you'll agree the issue is still alive
    today.\r\n\r\nThe EFF video on the topic specifically mentions parody as an example
    of fair use. This is worth fighting for! Time for me to send some $ to the EFF.\r\n\r\nBTW
    Chesh, Behind the Typeface is a great video and I enjoyed it very much. I think

    in their negotiations to get licensing fees out of Google. Google is just going
    along with it, they're more concerned with pleasing Viacom and getting those Daily
    Show clips back up than any fair use issues. \r\n\r\nAnd who knows, maybe the
    Viacom flunkies who compiled the list of those 100,000 clips thought it actually
    was from Behind the Music! It is a spot-on parody...\r\n\r\n"

    posts. Also, the Damage in this potential case, is much more substantial, and
    the party responsible for this damage by obviously overzealously pursuing protection,
    has lots of $$$. One can look at this as a problem, as in they have tons of lawyers
