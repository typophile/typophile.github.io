  the typeface used right here on Typophiles page. Wouldn't it have to be something
  that I already have on my computer since it's actual text and not an image?\r\n\r\nI
  love the combination of slab and curly serifs but can't for the life of me figure
  out what it is. So, friends, What is the typeface used for the page headers here?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a million!\r\nBeth"

    does a web page display a font that you don't have on your computer? Is the entire
    font somehow embedded in the HTML? \r\n\r\nI know about type, but I'm clueless
    about web design... obviously. =P"

  body: WHOA! (hangs head in shame) I can't believe I missed that! Looking too hard
    to find it I guess. Also thanks for the info about displaying type online. I work
    so little with web building that I had no idea that was even possible! Awesome!
