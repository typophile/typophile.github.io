  all of my resources to find it. Any help with a name would be much appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bebop_6491.gif]

  body: It's similar to Berhard. I think it is form Letraset.

  body: Yeah, the tall ascenders made me think of that, too. I looked at my Letraset
    catalog, but I couldn't find it. I KNOW I've seen it before...Again I wish I had
    a photographic memory.

    Lisa</a>. How old is the sample?

  body: A fellow typophile just contacted me and let me know the font is a filled-in
    Burlington, so it was Letraset after all. I guess I didn't pay attention to it
    since it was an inline face. Thanks for the responses!
