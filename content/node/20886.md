body: I hate that I can't ID this. I need to get more sleep. :) Anyway, I'm just looking
  to ID the slightly distressed serif that used at the top and for the date at the
  bottom. It might actually be the low resolution that makes it looks distressed,
  but I don't think so.

    of House fonts could be good substitutes: 'House of Death', 'Randumhouse' and
    'Fink Condensed' all come to mind.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: It's custom, those S's don't match. Caslon lacks the sharp serifs of the sample.
