body: "Hi friends,\r\n\r\nI'm developing a script font that relies on Contextual Alternates
  for the script connections.\r\n\r\nAfter I've added a\r\n<code>\r\n  # Latin\r\n
  \ script latn;\r\n    # Dutch\r\n    language NLD;\r\n          sub i j by ij; #
  Dutch ij\r\n</code>\r\nto the font, the Contextual Alternates feature is not applied
  anymore when the language in InDesign 7.0.4 is set to Dutch.\r\nThe other languages
  work as expected.\r\nThe Contextual Alternates features does not contain any Script/Language
  tags, only default Script/Language substituations.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have experience
  with this?\r\nThank you."

  body: I would not presume what people mean. More and more rely on spell checkers
    and I would expect the spell checker to do better job than a blind substitution
    at the font level.

  body: "My keyboard is the French Canadian keyboard (I mean what is printed on the
    keys corresponds to the Canadian French CSA layout) but I have to switch all the
    time between layouts because the position for the characters used in LaTeX are
    not handy with the Canadian French CSA layout; I also use the US extended keyboard
    layout (I thus need to know where the characters are because they are not printed
    on the keys).  So I am well aware of the limitations of keyboards. I also have
    layouts I made for myself with SIL Ukelele.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Canadian
    French CSA keyboard does not contain the oe ligature(*) and, so far as I know,
    people rely on the spell checker for it and, in my opinion,  it does a good job.
    \r\n\r\nWhether the Dutch spell checker is as useful with ij ligatures, I don't
    know. I just downloaded the OpenOffice nl_NL dictionary and it contains more than
    9700 entries with the ij ligature. I am not saying that adding an ij character
    on the keyboard could not be beneficial but I fail to see how it could improve
    much the final text, whether printed or for the screen. \r\n\r\n(*) On the mac,
    you need to type ALT q to get \u0153."

  body: IJ/ij was a separate key on Dutch typewriters, and it is only since the advent
    of computers and hardware based on US models that it has not been readily available
    for input as a separate character. That doesn't stop some Dutch publishers from
    routinely replacing all occurences of i+j in Dutch texts with the Unicode ij digraph
    character. Why do they do this? Because in Dutch orthography this digraph has
    behaviours in casing, spacing and accentuation that differ from the i and j as
    independent letters. There are means to apply these behaviours to i+j, but it
    is much easier to do so with the ij character.

  body: "I'm not sure there's any unused room in the Dutch layout, and I <em>am</em>
    pretty sure people hate learning new things that seem trivial (like a new key
    on a keyboard).* But my own point was that \"IJ\"/\"ij\" exists as a unity, and
    it's better to have a smarter font than a dumber one (even if a spell-checker
    can sometimes help).\r\n\r\n* Although a nice \"behind-the-scenes\" [Shift-]Alt-something
    should work well.\r\n\r\nAlso, I personally don't trust spell-checkers too much;
    I have a problem with <em>Word's English spell-checker</em> about once a week,
    nevermind something cheesy somebody might be using for a less-supported language.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>\r\nit's better to have a smarter font than a dumber one\r\n</blockquote>\r\nIf
    you have a \"smart font\" that automatically replaces ij by the digraph, then
    what do you do when you don't want the ligature? With LaTeX, I know how to prevent
    \"automatic ligatures\". With opentype fonts, is it easy to put a zero width non
    breaking character between the i and the j? Is there other tools available? With
    the babel package in LaTeX, I could also switch from Dutch to English for the
    corresponding word; can that be done in standard text editors so that Fiji would
    not be written with a ligature?\r\n\r\nIn any case, if I use for Dutch the same
    rules I use for French, if the input file does not comply with the Dutch dictionary,
    it is simply erroneous, even if the font makes the output look right."

    that enables you to set the language as Dutch is going to let you set the language
    to something else. Language tagging is pretty standard in text processing these
    days, because spellchecking, hyphenation etc. all rely on it.\r\n\r\nMy Leiden
    client, Brill, regularly use the Unicode IJ/ij digraph characters, but in the
    fonts I made for them they also wanted the kind of Dutch-specific ligation proposed
    in this thread."
