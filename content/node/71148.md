  and not TTF or WOFF? Seems strange to me since Apple\xAE Safari\xAE (Webkit) supports
  TTF from version 3.1 and later. Thanks!"

  body: I was thinking the same Simon. I suspect that they are not intentionally adding
    this limitation to @font-face, but rather just blocking the download of TTF file
    type globally on the device.

    they've done is added PDFs as a content source to iBooks in the next version.
    \r\n\r\nYou can view PDFs in all sorts of ways--Mail, Safari, special reader apps,
    etc. If there are fonts embedded in a PDF, they are displayed. Same with the iPhone
    going all the way back to the first one.\r\n\r\nMy guess as to why they haven't
    enabled @font-face for TTF and OTF: to reduce the amount of data needed for downloading
    a web page, both for speed and to conserve the limited amount of RAM in the devices."

    right, but they've had years to \"harden\" their PDF viewer against this type
    of attack (perhaps is uses a standalone rasterizer too?) but they are relative
    newcomers to the web-delivered-font attack vector.\r\n\r\nMark may have something
    - they are obsessive about Safari performance esp. on these devices.    \r\n"

    the more reason for them to add a compressed format like WOFF at the earliest.\r\nBut,
    conservation as motivation doesn't make a lot of sense to me in that SVG data
    is bloated compared to the equivalent data sent as an OTF or TTF. And since the
    Apple rasterizer throws away the TrueType hints, the most sensical thing would
    have been for them to, at least, have allowed OTF CFF files if file size was the
    concern.\r\n\r\nI think the decision was more akin to a coin toss."
