  sans with an angular design. Routed in both modern geometry and historical handwriting,
  Grey Sans bridges the gaps of neutrality and warmth, precision and humanism, and
  serious and fun. Grey Sans covers the grey areas of typeface design.\r\n\r\nAvailable

  body: "I like that |a|!\r\n\r\nSome of the kerning strikes me as off, though. The
    |ve| in posters 6 and 7 collide, and the |xt| in poster 8 feel too wide, for instance.\r\n\r\nI
    also find the tail on the |q| rather jarring. Are you offering a stylistic alternate? "

  body: "thanks catharsis.\r\nI investigated the kerning, and the ve was over zealous
    typesetting, thanks.\r\nno stylistic alternates just yet, as this is my first
    release.\r\n\r\nj."
