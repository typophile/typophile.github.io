  be as omnipresent as the aforementioned.\r\n\r\nHowever as it, along with the other
  ClearType typefaces, do seem to be optimised for screen, what are your thoughts
  on the suitability of the typeface in a printed environment?"

  body: "Not suitable.\r\n\r\nI was asked to use it for a book, and although I recommended
    against it based on prior experience (*) the client \"really really liked it on
    screen\". In print, the letter is just way too fat to comfortably read.\r\n\r\n(*)
    This prior experience includes using Verdana for print, using Arial for print,
    using Tahoma for print, and using Times New Roman for print. The common denominator
    here is <em>not</em>, let me repeat <em>not</em>, that they are Microsoft fonts
    \"and thus bad\", but they were all designed, hinted, and optimized for the screen."

    families for its typefaces.\r\nThe hoary \"four styles is a family\" mantra, don't
    cha know.\r\n\r\nFor sans faces, type foundries generally provide their clients
    with a range of weights, from Hairline to Black.\r\nFor serif faces, type foundries
    often provide both text and display fonts: media-specific alternates.\r\n\r\nBut
    there is still no Georgia Display, no Verdana Light.\r\n\r\nWould it not be possible,
    when a Light weight is rendered at small size on screen, to change the font?\r\nAfter
    all, \"ForceBold\" has addressed this kind of issue, via creative engineering,
    from the early days of PostScript.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    that mean that Myriad and Frutiger are in their regular weight to bold to be printed
    too?\r\nOr do the fonts for some reason render differently on screen than they
    are interpreted by a printer?\r\n\r\nJust want to understand the issue and the
    recommendation from somebody who is knowledgeable about that.\r\n\r\nI guess in
    a professional environment you printed offset? Is the same assessment true for
    laser or ink printing?\r\n\r\n(Screenshot produced on a Mac)\r\n\r\n"

    in print.\r\nI have seen it used, in many sizes, even in small magazines.\r\n\r\n@Nick:
    If you use Miller, it\u2019s perfectly compatible with Georgia. Before purchasing
    Miller Text, I tried by purchasing Miller Text Small Caps only, to compensate
    for Georgia\u2019s lack of Small Caps, and \u2013 with a slight point size adjustment
    \u2013 it worked very good both in trials I was doing for eBooks and in laser
    printed copies.\r\n\r\nHey, we\u2019re talking of Matthew Carter. It\u2019s practically
    impossible to have a \"not stellar\" typeface from him\u2026 :)"
