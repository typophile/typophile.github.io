  of disco juice. i was asked to design a logo only, they plan to have posters and
  fliers, usual malarkey. so i don't digg the name but that was given to me to work
  with. and they were quite specific to use it literally. let me know your thoughts...\r\n\r\nbrian"

    go with insect wings, make sure they've got veins. You could also try bat wings
    or bird wings.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: I would draw a rhino head wearing an old-fashioned flying helmet and goggles,
    maybe with a silk scarf flying out behind it, in the style of an emblem that would
    be painted on the side of a plane.

  body: "This looks good. My only critique would be that the two 'N's have the same
    grunge effect, which makes it look like you used some free grunge font off of
    the internet. Use a regular font and grunge it up yourself to get a unique look
    for each repeating letter.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. The kerning sucks, but I
    assume this was part of the grunge look."

    bolder than that, I think this relies on the logo being 3 inches big to work well,
    what happens if it's reduced down to .5 inch?"

    like grungy type, not a grunge font anymore.\r\n\r\nHow I grunge up stuff in photoshop
    is by using a grunge brush and painting on a mask layer of an object. - similar
    procedure in illustrator do do it as vector."
