  little too fine to surprint pictures. \r\nI'd like to avoid a didot type of approach--it's
  too stiff; needs more personality\r\n\r\nThis display face would most likely be
  partnered with the sans serif Gotham (now, I really sound like a broken record--hell,
  I should get a commission!) by HoeflerF-J: http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html\r\n\r\nI'm
  project I'm working on is a magazine redesign for an ultra-affluent market demographic
  dealing with boats. So, I'll be surprinting water and sky pretty often. \r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?\r\n"

  body: "I personally like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/zapf-renaissance/\">Zapf
    Renaissance</a>, which is familiar and friendly like Palatino, but enough different
    not to be overworn. See <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/4782\">this helpful
    Typophile thread</a> on the difference between B and H - the only difference I
    can see is tracking, but that's just the low-res preview.\r\n\r\nITC Galliard
    is in the extended family of Garamond, but crisper. It feels a little cold to
    me, though, even though that might work ok with the Gotham.\r\n\r\nA large optical
    scale of Centaur might also fit the bill, but it hasn't been released yet. Another
    classic that might work is <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/HiddenGems/Perpetua.htm\">Perpetua</a>.\r\n\r\nOne
    new font by a living designer that deserves more attention is Cycles by <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/\">Sumner
    Stone</a>."

    all your requirements perfectly. Also check out his Corundum. Joshuadarden.com\r\n\r\nSwift

    the produce section!\r\n\r\nStone Serif and Stone Sans. Warnock Pro from Adobe.\r\n\r\nBesides
    Reminga by Xavier Dupr\xE9, mentioned above, there's also his new Zingha, which
    is even snappier. Dig that lower-case a...!! Check out both at fontshop.com\r\n\r\nProblem
    with Gotham: no oldstyle figures, which are increasingly in demand for style reasons.
    Check out Darden's Freight Sans as a really fine alternative.\r\n\r\nYour requirements
    demand more than two weights per family, and all these have at least three, very
    important for flexibility in use as you mention. \r\n"

  body: All of you rock! My memories of the faces mentioned seem like the suggestions
    are all on target. I'll take a look at the various families as soon as I can (while
    not hampered by deadlines). As for the question to maximum size, I'm thinking
    pullquotes and subheads at 20pts. Thanks! JL
