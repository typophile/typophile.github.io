  body: "Since wynn is frequently replaced by W, even in scholarly editions which
    preserve other archaic letters, there's not really much typographic tradition
    to draw on (I'm assuming here, perhaps erroneously, that you're asking about modern
    whiteletter faces).\r\n\r\nI'm by no means an authority on this matter, but I've
    taught courses in the history of English, so my aesthetics are probably not completely
    out to left field. I prefer wynn to sit on the baseline, but I think the most
    important consideration in designing a good wynn is to make sure it is readily
    distinguishable from both P and Thorn. Giving it a descender is one way of doing
    this, which might well be why this variant arose in the first place.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n"
