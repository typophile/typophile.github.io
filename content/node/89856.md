  is \"C\xF4t\xE9 Mer\"\r\n\r\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/401/photovd.jpg/\r\n\r\nThe
  quality of the picture does not help the free online recognition services I've used,
  and I've been able to find a few lookalikes, but not the exact match.\r\n\r\nAn
  idea, anyone ? \r\n"

    Shelley already, but the other letters didn't match... and it didn't even come
    to my mind that there could be more than one font involved :)\r\n\r\nThanks a
    lot to both of you\r\n\r\n[edit : seems like the 'o' is from yet another font,
    unless I'm mistaken, but that is much less important]"
