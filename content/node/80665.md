body: "I'm using Illustrator CS, though I also downloaded a trial of CS5 and this
  behavior is the same.\r\n\r\nI have a brochure with columns of justified text 5\"
  wide. I noticed that Illustrator wasn't breaking \"multi-functional\" on the hyphen
  and instead gave the previous line tons of word spacing. Testing with a new document,
  I can't get Illustrator to break on a hyphen, which seems baffling.\r\n\r\nI don't
  want auto-hyphenation, but I tried turning it on and fiddling with its settings
  until it broke at the hyphen. Strangely, it then didn't justify the line ending
  with \"multi-\". Not good.\r\n\r\nI also tried inserting a soft-return after \"multi-\"
  and again Illustrator didn't justify that line.\r\n\r\nThe workaround seems to be
  to use a hard return and set the first paragraph to justify all lines and remove
  the \"space before\" setting of the rest. This seems like a horrible kludge.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a better approach?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n"

    is for drawing, not for typesetting.\r\nI know that is not the answer you wanted,
    sorry."

  body: "That's a bit odd considering that Illustrator has InDesign's multi-line composer
    and supports multiple pages. Surely a brochure is an appropriate task for it,
    if anything is.\r\n\r\nFreehand was perfect for jobs like these. How Adobe hasn't
    caught up to where Freehand was in 2001 \u2013 especially considering they own
    it \u2013 is a mystery.\r\n"
