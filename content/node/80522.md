  on a design I enjoy, but I'd like another set of discerning eyes on it if possible!
  I do freelance, but I work in a number of fields, so I didn't want a card that played
  up one over the other. I also tend to write small notes to the people I exchange
  with, so having an airy card is important for that. So it basically became a matter
  of font selection. \r\n\r\nMy inspiration were vintage cards from the 40's - 60's.
  Those 3 decades are obviously very different so I ended up narrowing my focus to
  a more late-50's/60's kind of look with ITC Blair and initially Futura which I swapped
  for Avenir.\r\n\r\nJust curious if there are any glaring typographical problems
  with this design. Also, if you have any simple ideas for this kind of style I'd
  love to hear them. \r\n\r\nThanks guys.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Khx4M.jpg\"></img>"

    its clients than any combination of Lady Gaga, Snoop Dog, Justin Beber, Madonna,
    and Rihanna are in today's pop music scene. If you ever knew him, you knew that
    this card was just perfect for him. Remember the Movie where George Burns plays
    God?  He has a simple business card with only the plain letters GOD on a blank
    white card. When you are "there", you don't need to explain.  When you are just

    a business card to sell that. Even better, trade a graphic designer some photo

  body: "Don't take it the wrong way, but the card looks rather dull. It <em>is</em>
    minimalistic, but it is forgettable. It lacks the A-HA moment. At the very least
    I'd consider alternative layouts. \r\n\r\nWithout implying that these are any
    better, here are some options I sketched for my card some time ago:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/layouts_3715.png]\r\n\r\n<code></code>\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    look at two-sided (black/white) stock, or sandwiched stock. Or do a blind press
    of something on a back of the card. Or die-cut corners with a very small radius
    (1 mm or thereabouts). Or add a quirk to the actual card content, e.g. say you
    are a \"professional creative\"... Something to stand out. But in a subtle, minimalistic
    way :)\r\n\r\nAlso, I would advise against going with the letterpress. \r\n\r\nFor
    one there's something called dot gain - an effect of finer details coming out
    far heavier and coarse than they are in the design. This can be accommodated of
    course, assuming the printer knows his stuff (Mandate Press, for example, does
    not). \r\n\r\nFor two, the delicate appearance, which is frequently what one wants
    with a minimalist card, is not exactly compatible with the letter press. If you
    haven't done it already, go out and physically look at the finest possible letterpress
    you can find. Letterpress photos found online are <em>extremely</em> misleading.
    The shots are made from that exact angle that makes the piece looks great, but
    from other angles it may look crude and heavy. You can probably tell that I got
    burnt by this. So here's my $250 (+tax +s/h +sneaky-ups-charges) advise - do look
    at physical samples first.\r\n\r\nAlso, have a look at (intaglio) engraving as
    an alternative. The printed part has a texture similar to that of thermo print
    (which is said to be a poor's man engraving), but it allows for much finer detail.
    I did a run of white on black cards few years back and they came out really impressive
    (<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/37230902@N04/3429442086/sizes/l/in/photostream/>here
    is a close-up</a>).\r\n\r\nYet another option appears to be silk-screening, however
    I only saw a sample of a card made with it on Flickr (with a macro close-up) and
    it looked very precise. I asked around and that appears to be a European specialty.
    I couldn't find any silk-screener in Canada capable of reproducing that card.\r\n\r\nLastly,
    for the design inspiration swing by business card related groups on Flickr. There's
    plenty of junk there, but lots and lots of really good ones too."

  body: Dot gain is a function of half-tone dots gaining weight due to inking and
    blanket pressure during printing. The same phenomenon happens with type, the smaller
    and lighter, the more noticeable. There are no dots but the name that is more
    accurate for solid type is "Press Gain" or "ink spread".

    as well, as it didn't really make any sense in retrospect, and have gone with
    the +1 201 123 4567 advice. Looks much better. \r\n\r\nAlso, Trevor, the font
    is Avenir... obviously a cousin of Futura but a little sexier IMO. Especially
    in the C, which is obviously important in this case. But I agree, I'm going with

  body: "Minimalism is about choosing the fewest pieces necessary and using them in
    the most considered possible way.\r\n\r\nYou put your name and title in the middle
    and the two other details in the corners. I agree that it is \"templatey\". You're
    spreading yourself out for no reason, and not creating a simple visual flow between
    the elements.\r\n\r\nTry minimizing the \"footprint\" of your text. Group it,
    create a vertical axis that aligns them all. Paul Rand's card is classy because
    it is one font, in one weight, and he leads your eye down a single path. On that
    path you see things in the order he has chosen for you: name, address, telephone
    number. When your eye jumps to the left (because he breaks his vertical axis)
    it sees the company name, not something about him. See what I mean?\r\n\r\nMinimalism
    is my favourite thing. When you reduce your card into its bare components, you
    have to be extra considerate about the fundamental properties: alignment, size,
    weight, contrast, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, don't you need an email address? I think in
    today's market you could get away with a card that said: \r\n\r\nfirst.last@yourURLInADifferentWeight.com\r\n\r\n...and

  body: "There are other aspects of minimalism too that you're missing out on. Again
    because it is just the barest elements, you need to get those elements exactly
    right.\r\n\r\nThe relative weights of the name and the title, for instance, feel
    off for me. The colour is too-uneven-or-not-uneven-enough, and the combination
    of the wide version of Avenir with the spaced-out regular emphasise precisely
    the differences between the two, when you're trying to achieve a cohesiveness.\r\n\r\nBut
    my major problem is the spacing, the rhythm. Pay super-good attention to the composition,
    the margins, the optical look of the placements in relation to each other. The
    two lines in the center really jar for me because the rhythm is almost, but not
    quite, a whole line of small-type while space between the two - it makes it feel
    cramped and stilted in a way nudging the type up or down wouldn't.\r\n\r\nCristopher
    Dean's granddad's card works well (besides the kerning issue) because the composition
    is so straightforward, with a clear top half and a coloured bottom half; because
    the typefaces gel better; and because the spacing is based on a much more thought-through,
    rigid grid."

  body: If you want to do minimalist, read Zen and the Art of Archery.  To many people
    minimalism is just things that are sparse, simple, or uncluttered. That is just
    a vague surface.  When you limit yourself to very few elements, each one and its
    relationship to the next is extremely and specifically important.  It is much
    easier to send a huge unabridged dictionary.  It is another to extract from it
    just the exact words to be a poem.  I think you must first ask yourself, "Are
    you REALLY a minimalist" or do you just admire that kind of work? If you are attempting
    to indicate to a client base that this is who you are, then truth in advertising
    would mean you had to actually be? If you truly are, then it will just happen
    when you work. It is not a snap-on aesthetic.

    consideration before print. You guys will get a say in the final final. \r\n\r\n-
    I have a heavily \"guided\" layout so I will take another look to make sure everything
    is precise. It will drive me crazy if something is a little bit off and I have
    to look at it 1,000 times.\r\n\r\n- Perhaps my use of minimalist was a bit self-indulgent.
    My work actually isn't minimal at all, but I wanted my card to be a sort of anti-thesis
    to the dirtiness and grime that works it's way into some of my stuff. There is
    also a bit of cheekiness with regard to the \"Wile E. Coyote / Patrick Bateman\"
    type card. A theme I often work with is \"low brow in a high brow way\". So this
    is kind of my way of packaging myself in that classic, 'high brow' way, while
    demonstrating with my work that I'm capable of photographing someone vomiting.
    (For an extreme example...)\r\n\r\n- If I change the layout more significantly
    than properly spacing everything, I'm not sure the card would still have that
    classic print shop vibe about it, and might look too, \"Oh, yes, I'm a designer.
    Check out how right-justified all this shit is.\" That being said, I will definitely
    play around...\r\n\r\n- Keeping in mind my early-60's / Public School sort of

    http://www.slowprint.com/portfolio/letterpress-samples/P9240044.jpg for example\r\nOf
    course this was on expensive Copperplate Etching paper, which takes light inking
    perfectly.\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of minimal inking on the press, and micrometer
    roller settings.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many designers expect letterpress to have
    the depression of a 35 ton weight (we can do that, but we don't like to) AND the
    density of 6-color litho AND the texture in the stock of a wool blanket.\r\n\r\nAssuming
    the designer/client understands the letterpress process, we will produce exceedingly
    fine impressions.\r\n\r\nBasic equation:  more texture in the stock =  more ink
    to get solids\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we prefer less ink (which we do) we must accept
    less solid coverage on textured stock. \r\n\r\nFor type on white-ish stock, this
    is generally not a big problem, since even low coverage will be plenty for typical
    caption sized type. However, on larger sizes, there will be EITHER too much ink,
    or less than 'perfect' coverage.\r\n\r\nFor those who understand, we will double-hit
    the larger solids, cutting away the small type from the form (this is photopolymer,
    of course) and running the sheets back through the Windmill to lay a second layer
    of ink in the larger areas. The Heidelberg Windmill is capable of pinpoint perfect
    registration. This technique was used with silver ink on black stock in this card:
    http://slowprint.com/sources/PC160082.jpg \r\nEverything but the \"Projekt, Inc.\"
    was cut away from the form and then the sheets were run a second time. There's
    a tiny bit of ink creep on the second impression in order to  cover. But the fine
    type is... fine, no?\r\n\r\nFor those who don't understand and want them cheap
    and fast, there are plenty of other letterpress printers out there.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\nslowprint.com\r\n"

    pass with a lower ink and packing for the small type? Years ago when letterpress
    was more the norm, I had difficulty with large solids--mostly with reversed finer
    lines.  Sometimes I would make a fine-line only outline impression that worked
    like a holding line.  I would then come back with the large solids and used the
    fine line pass as trapping.  Things are WAY easier now ;-)"

  body: "Hi Chris, er, @dezcom...\r\n\r\nI don't double-hit all large solids. Lower
    contrast between the ink color and substrate will of course make this unnecessary.
    Also, it depends enormously on the stock itself.\r\nThe smoother the stock the
    less it's necessary. Also if I'm running on the Miehle Cylinder, it's possible
    to get better coverage (although the same equation still applies) due to the moving
    impression rather than the instant pressure of the platen.\r\n\r\nRegarding running
    two forms, it's far easier, given the perfect registration possible on the Windmill,
    to just run it through a second time after removing the lighter stuff from the
    plate (one reason I prefer plastic-backed polymer over the steel stuff!). Don't
    need to re-register to a second form, etc.\r\n\r\nThe 'trapping' technique is
    still a good one, of course, but the main thing is trying to educate people to
    respect their materials and to understand the 'mechanickal art' in the process.
    I love the look of slightly under-inked type - because I see letters as individuals
    (as a type designer). Really, to me it's perfect if it's slightly under-inked.
    When printed on dampened stock, the coverage simply can not be better! See my
    Rudolf Koch piece.* \r\n\r\nBut a graphic designer wants (reasonably) the whole
    piece to have visual power, which often means the subtle crispness of perfect
    inking must be slightly compromised to gain density. (on a textured stock, that
    is. On coated stock, it's all sharp and gorgeous and dense. But who wants a deep
    impression on coated stock? Yuck.)\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/66350 (\"Pace\"
    Hrant, I know we disagree on the depth of the impression, which on dampened stock
    is quite acceptable ;-)\r\n"

    advice ... Your spacing is a mess, and especially in that last line where there''s
    no logical grouping of things except a slightly heavier weight on the website
    (which looks more like a mistake and throws off the balance). You need to consider
    contrast, spacing, kerning, horizontal rythm, logical grouping, optical alignment,
    balance etc and those diagonal lines and the type should echo each other somehow.
    As others have pointed out before: this is not minimalism, it''s just few elements.
    I''d be happy to help you out with this (and so would probably the rest of us),

    and in use.  I never owned one, too much money, but I sure loved Display PostScript
    and true Unix multitasking! My use of the machines was all in the design/publishing
    arena so the apps I saw were limited to a specific arena. It was like I have always
    coveted a Porsche 911 or even the old Speedster but knew it was only a dream to
    ever get one. The Unix workstation never came down to the price range of what
    people were willing t pay for the competitive DTP market.  Microsoft saw Unix
    as more of a threat to the straight business market outside of engineering and
    science and Apple's new leader  sure was not going to jump in and help his old
    boss prove he was smarter after all.  Steve Jobs did his usual brilliant job of
    hype at publishing conferences--I saw him at Seybold a few times and was impressed.\r\n\r\nI
    might also ask if you have much direct experience working for large organizations
    or corporations and getting agreement on corporate identity materials?  Rand was
    a master of this but even he knew when a done deal was a done deal by the boardroom
    Brooks Bros suit guys.  Rand always made a very logical and thought out book to
    present a logo.  After seeing his books for IBM, Westinghouse, and even his wayward
    attempt with Ford Motors, I can't imagine any remote chance of the usual flippant,
    ad jockey whipped out quickie being even a conversation with him.  Jobs loved
    Rand and what he stood for as a designer.  rand was surprised to get the call
    from such a young gun like Steve but was glad to go beyond the mammoth IBM mega-bureaucracy
    in the high-tech market.\r\nI am sure we can differ on our opinion of what landed
    on the cube but you have to give Rand the credit he is due for creation of the
    corporate identity as a must for any operation worth its salt."
