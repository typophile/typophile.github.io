  if anyone here can help me with the opening titles. I have attached some screenshots.\r\n\r\nBtw
  (and off-topic): Please recommend some more movies like Bullitt, French Connection
  etc. to me if you're into this type of film.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    sure if it's ever been digitized.

    href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0067927/\">Vanishing Point</a> -- the original
    with Barry Newman and Cleavon Little, not the tacky remake with Viggo Mortensen."

  body: "Thank you very much! Compacta seems to be a close alternative (the bolder,
    the better).\r\n\r\n<cite>Vanishing Point \u2014 the original with Barry Newman
    and Cleavon Little</cite>\r\nGreat - will see if I can find it. Isn't that the
    one they talk about all the time in the new Tarantino?"
