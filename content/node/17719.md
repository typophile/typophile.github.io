  Marcel Nebel. I've only seen two samples of his work (circa early 70s), but am in
  love with it. If anyone knows anything, or any tips- I'd be deeply thankful.\r\n\r\nBest
  regards,\r\nNorman"

    by Paul Shaw, of a book called <em>The Road to Basel (der Weg nag Basel): typographic
    reflections by students of the typographer and teacher Emil Ruder</em>. One of
    the former students contributing to that book happens to be Marcel Nebel.'

  body: Best of luck... I went through the indexes of quite a few books and could
    find no mention of him. But then again I do not own too many books specifically
    about Swiss typography.

  body: "yes. ricardo- that's the book where i saw the sample. it was compiled by
    helmut schmid as well.\r\n\r\nan excellent book, that few people know of.\r\n\r\ndo
    you own The Road To Basel? i don't have access to my copy, and was hoping if you
    have one, you could let me know the title and publisher of the little tea ceremony
    book that ruder did.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nn"
