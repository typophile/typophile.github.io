  really struggling to nail a typeface for the logotype. Was playing around with Chalet
  but feel it doesn't sit with the mark... please feel free to critique... suggestions
  for typeface are most welcome.\r\n\r\nThank you \r\n\r\nMcD7"

  body: "This is a clever solution to the E & C combination but I feel it falls short
    on living up to the company name... because it's not really evoking (I associate
    that word with imagination) nor does it come across as very creative. I think
    you should continue to play around with this solution though.\r\n"

    books. I'll try and dig it up when I have time. Just a heads up.

  body: "Howdy Epsilicon, that mark you would be referring to on Logopond is mine,
    its all in the username, like yourself I visit Logopond on occasion. Glad you
    remembered it though, Cheers!\r\n\r\n@Melo - Thanks for the feedback. It took
    me  along time to come with a suitable name that I liked. I do like the letter
    combination of the letters and maybe that is where I should concentrate..."
