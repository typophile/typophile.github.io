  is an antique font that was never digitalized--what you see here is a sample that
  has been stamped out --the company that made this rubber stamp set has ceased production--
  i am considering producing them myself, & the first step is to find this font--\r\n\r\nthanks
  for your help--\r\n\r\ncindy c"

    Light Condensed</a>, but I don't think this stamp was literally made from a digital
    font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
