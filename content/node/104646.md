    slightly customizd to me.

    closer to Saturn-Extended Bold [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/saturn/extended-bold/]]\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help!\r\nDane"

  body: Disagree on Saturn Extended even if it looks to share quite the same design
    backbone as Eurostile. Sample /S has a transition spine between top and bottom
    part almost horizontal like Eurostile, Saturn's more oblique. But Saturn could
    work fine too :)
