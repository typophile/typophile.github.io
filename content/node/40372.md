    version, which is now used sporadically in the Greek Estia newspaper is a bit
    rough, and it does contain Latin characters in the same style as the Greek characters.
    It is not for free, one has to order it from cannibal Fonts. The Greek Font Society
    revilal looks much better and lighter in weight and totally for free.\r\n\r\nEleana
