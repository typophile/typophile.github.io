  a school in italy, and im at the first year.\r\n\r\nMy class was given the assignment
  to design the corporate identity for a factitius contemporary art gallery. The gallery
  will be located in a monastery originally builded in 1582, wich became a law court
  in 1974, and has been recently restructured, in particular with a modern a geometrical
  inside, to became a cultural and art gallery. \r\n\r\nHere are some photos of the
  inside and outside of the building: http://www.padovanet.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=12026#par_0\r\n\r\nAniway
  this is the logo i made: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/newseum_4281.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
  a custom lettering based on Itc Avant Garde Gothic.\r\n\r\nI have to realize a brochure
  and a depliant for the opening, i wich the main event will be a showcase of the
  art of some local young illustrators.\r\n\r\nUntil now i used Gill Sans for all
  my preliminary concepts,  even for the \"galleria d'arte contemporanea\" part of
  the logo,  but im not happy with it, and plus, the logo isn't even avant garde but
  a personal re design. So im searching some typefaces that could suit the job, but
  i dont know much about fonts because like i said i study design only since a few
  months.\r\n\r\nIm searching two typefaces, a display  one and one for the body of
  text, that goes well with the geometry of my logo. They have to be modern faces,
  but maybe with a touch of classicity that goes well with the contradiction of the
  location, with it's classic outside and modern inside.\r\n\r\nThe teachers said
  we could use different typefaces from the corporate ones for the brochure because
  the main theme is the showcase of young illustrators, but im not to keen on this,
  i think it's best to find strong corporate ones and stick with them to reinforce
  the identity.\r\n\r\nUntill now, i was thinking to switch to gotham display + whitney
  text.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Suggestions?\r\n\r\n"
