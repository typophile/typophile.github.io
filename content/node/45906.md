  body: ".....again - all these Gothic faces people need IDs for today!\r\n\r\nLooks
    like Gotham or Trade Gothic, but the 'O' is very round like Futura's and the 'U'
    is very narrow.....that 'U' might be the key to look for in samples to try and
    match....could be one of thousands of look-alike and copy-cat Gothics that have
    been made over the years. \r\n\r\nThese faces are the easiest to copy because
    of their simple shapes, so that's why there are so many near-duplicates.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    Futura - looking at the 'R', the right leg starts too far out to the right along
    the bottom of the bowl to be Futura. The lighter weights of Future show the right
    leg starting all the way back at the bowl's intersection with the left leg! That's
    one of the more unique characters of Futura, so it's most likely not anyone's
    cut of Futura's shapes."

    is a pretty close match except the narrow 'U'. Could it be a mix'n'match?
