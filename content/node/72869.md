  body: Thanks oldnick. While I think that's very close, I don't think that's exactly
    it. Those seem to have a gill sans-esque sharp curved stroke ending to them. I
    think this typeface's stroke endings are all straight and blocky.

  body: "Keep in mind that it can always be lettering, not a font \u2013 especially
    with logos. \u2018Mrs. Meyer\u2019s\u2019 is based on a popular American lettering
    style. The typefaces Nick mentioned are very much in this vein. More alternatives
    in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/72370#comment-420985\">this list</a>. You
