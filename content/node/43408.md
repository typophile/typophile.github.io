body: "Graphic design has been a huge interest of mine for the last few years and
  after attending a couple different colleges in non design related programs, I\u2019m
  thinking about switching over to a design school. The only problem is I\u2019ve
  looked into most area graphic design schools and they are a lot more than I can
  afford. That being said, there\u2019s a local art school that offers a bachelors
  in illustration that is less expensive than the other schools. They have a decent
  amount of graphic design classes. So my question is, would this illustration program
  be a good way to go? My plan is to run my own graphic design studio, but just in
  case, would I be able to land a job as a graphic designer with that degree?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    you won\u2019t have too much trouble getting a job with an illustration degree.
    There are some really great firms that do a lot of in-house illustration and ONLY
    hire people who can draw well."

  body: I came form an illustration background myself. I did a post-grad in electronic
    prepress to get my foot in the door and got a really good internship and job at
    a top design firm. As James said, it's more about your portfolio. Having drawing
    skills definitely helps in design - for logos and project where there's no good
    imagery or photography to work with. Learn all you can about typography - in and
    out of school.
