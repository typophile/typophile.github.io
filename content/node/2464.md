    - moreso than others like the f,t,r..  and altogether it has a surprisingly hand-drawn
    quality to it <BR> <BR>on another note it&#39;s interesting to look at that swf
    file at low quality and resize the browser smaller and smaller &#40;or bigger&#41;,
    to see a couple different distortions happening <BR> <BR>the first moment that
    it turns into a smaller font &#40;from the way it looks presently&#41; is interesting
    - I mean despite the distortion it retains some legibility but holds a far looser
    and almost arabic feel to it '

    like the way it breaks up when reduced - i may work on something similar, though
