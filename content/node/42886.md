body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm a graphic designer and I'm trying to create a font where,
  while writing, each character will be randomly substituted by some other versions
  of the same character. So that for the \"a\" I'll have 3 different \"a\", for the
  \"b\" I'll have 3 different \"b\" and so on.\r\n\r\nI found some scripts in Typophile
  where it seems this would work (http://typophile.com/node/19625), but i actually
  don't know how to make it work in Fontlab... :/\r\n\r\nI supose I have to create
  one class per character (in the \"collection/classes\" panel) where I put all the
  glyphs I want to use for the substitution and then (in the \"opentype\" panel) assign
  the script to each class. Is that it?\r\n\r\nBased on another .otf font, I tried
  to roughly repeat the proceadure just to see if anything happens (just tried to
  assign some script to the first class I created - please see image attached), but
  when I try to generate the opentype font it gives me an error \"ERROR: There was
  a problem while compiling OpenType font. Final .otf font is not saved. Please, check
  OpenType features definition for errors\".\r\nI've checked, but apart from the UPM
  number, that I think has to be 1000, I have no clue of what I should be aware of...\r\n\r\nCould
  you please give me some hints on how to make it work?\r\nI would really apreciate
  some help since I'm complete \"new\" on Fontlab and font design as well.\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much in advance!\r\n\r\nAndreia\r\n"

    something like this into the liga feature:\r\n\r\nsub [a c m s] a' by a.alt1;\r\nsub
    [e i o t] a' by a.alt2;\r\n\r\n\r\n(means: after a c m s  glyph a is substituted
    by glyph a.alt1\r\n        after e i o t  glyph a is substituted by glyph a.alt2
    )\r\n\r\n\r\njs"

  body: The {liga} ligature feature is not a good place for this kind of substitution.
    Better to use {calt} contextual alternates feature instead, since that's the effect
    you're creating.

  body: "Karsten, There is no escape except for monowidth fonts :-)\r\n\r\nI am finding
    that glyph drawing is the easiest and quickest part of type design. I have torn
    apart metrics and redone kerning a thousand times. With each redo, I learn something
    new and start again! The increments of change keep getting smaller as my vision
    gets more acute and my critical judgement becomes more unyielding--I feel I am
    getting closer to the carrot on the string but it is still not quite in my grasp
