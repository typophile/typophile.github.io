    hadn't planned on making a lower case, since I've seen Museo's lower case used
    so often and so well."

  body: 'Thank you Eric. Indeed I planned Museo as an all caps display font, but due
    to many requests (also on my blog), I decided that it would be better to add more
    versatility to it. I Must have done something well, because most of the times
    I myself am surpised by how nice it looks. :-) '
