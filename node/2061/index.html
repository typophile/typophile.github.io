<div class=commentbody>Yipee!! Where's the edge? :^\ <br> <br>Ok. I think the 'e' in Claude could touch the 'S' in songs. The "Het Spectra" box of type could go to the left, lined up with "Coppens" perhaps. And the logo (box) could go to the right and maybe bleed of the top or right? I love that image.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hehe. Fooled ya, you big evil Internal Server. Gotcha! <br> <br>Okay here's the lowdown: I was lucky enough to find <br>reproductions of the original illustrations, so I really <br>wanted to use one. Typefaces are <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=109" target=_blank> Mrs Eaves</a> and <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/gothic-no-13/ target=_blank> Gothic No. 13</a> <br>which nicely enhance the period atmosphere.

<div class=commentbody>the contrast between the two faces is good. maybe the double p's should be in front of the image instead of behind. too bad about the information glut (i sympathize), but it's organized well. and, surprisingly, i like the color.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yves, love the mixture of sans and serif type it allows the eye to focus on areas of type, not be distracted by an even mass of color. As you said its alot of information for a poster. Could you make the logos at the bottom of the page smaller? All those different designs are visually disturbing. Especially the Acad--- logo by alice's foot. She'd hurt herself if she stepped on that one. Dan</div>

I prefer to have a letterspace between that <br>'e' and 'S'. <br>The logo actually bleeds off the top and left, and that's <br>a set position. The width of the poster is divided in <br>three, and the "Het Spectra" text box aligns with such <br>a division (check the text boxes at the bottom). <br> <br><i>> having Alice overlap the text is a little too subtle.</i> <br> <br>Alice ate one of the cookies and shrunk to 95%.

I hope you like it as well. <br>Colours are PMS 5565 (water green) & 429 (dark grey). <br> <br>I couldn't get Photoshop to preview the overprinting, <br>so I had to take this crummy screenshot in Illustrator. <br>Sorry'boutthat. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20440.jpg alt="Songs from Alice"></div>

<div class=commentbody>That is a lovely illustration. <br>I think the sans vs. serif is working out. <br> <br>I think the composers name and the title could be a bit smaller. 80% of what you have now. and perhaps following the grid a bit tighter. <br> <br>In general I'm looking for you to shrink things down so that you create more white space. <br> <br>Possibly smaller body type by about the same %, but I'd keep the line spacing. <br> <br>Also try de-emphasizing <i>from</i>. Maybe bring the top of the A in Alice up to the Bottom of the S in Songs. Then fit the from in the hole between the i and g? You might need to either go with a heavier weight for the "from," or possibly go lighter (just so it doesn't look close, but wrong). <br> <br>Ok. Let's get nitpicky: <br>- More line spacing between the Dates (sans) and the Days. <br>- Info & Tickets phone numbers should all be flush left. <br>- Are you allowed to jam all the logos together on the bottom? <br> <br>I think the layout you have going is a nice safe layout. Try something wildly asymmetrical (maybe using alice's line of vision to empasize the title in the opposite corner of the page). <br> <br>Not crazy about the colors. I'm seeing earth tones. Maybe a yellow ochre. Maybe and olive with a touch more green. <br> <br>Well. I've been staring at alphabets all day so I could be totally off base. <br> <br>Cheers, <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Have some wine, the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. I don't see any wine, she remarked. There isn't any, said the March Hare. Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it, said Alice angrily. It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited, said the March Hare.

<div class=commentbody>i think it feels waaaay too crowded. the illustration of alice is just stuffed in there, being contained by big words... i'd free up some white space. <br> <br>it's hard to look at the poster near the bottom. all the overlapping and different styles and numbers jammed together is a little illegible. i mean, i can read it if i try, but it's messy. <br> <br>i made some quick adjustments in photoshop to show you a way to free up some white space and make the overall poster be balanced. the typography, however, i couldn't look at in detail because it's a low-res screenshot... but i reworked the overall compostion. <br> <br>one other thing to think about is why is the leading for the top information different from the bottom information. it's the same type-size right? what IS that top info? <br> <br>let me know what you guys think. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20482.gif alt="his next to mine"></div>

<div class=commentbody>i think i did a decent job extracting white space from the original... but the typographic layouts are something i couldn't change in photoshop easily, and i would've stuck to the grid if i was working in illustrator. i think the title arrangement can be better. all i did was made it smaller and moved other things around. and changed the leading on the top info.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi everyone, 's about time I responded to your remarks <br>and corrections. I was a bit wary of the 'too many cooks <br>spoil the broth' syndrome, but overall I'm very pleased <br>by your comments, which I think will help me improve the <br>end result. I'm gonna do this in bits, so please bear <br>with me. <br> <br>First of all, the size is A2 (40 x 60 cm), which is why <br>I was hesitant to go smaller with the type. Randy's <br>remark and Loren's tinkering convinced me otherwise, <br>so thank you both. Also Eduardo was spot on with the <br>grid remark. On the other hand, it's always been my firm <br>conviction that the grid only stays in as long as it helps. <br>If it starts to hinder, fook it, as Noel Gallagher 'd say.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Then, onto the cute stuff: <br> <br>Chris <br> <br><i>> I thought that was Mrs Eaves...better hope Hrant doesn't <br>see this.</i> <br> <br>Hrant's never scared me or had me refrain from saying or <br>doing anything, silly you.

Sorry Randy, a nice safe design is <br>all the tiny budget is allowing. I'm already over. <br>BTW The green stays in. It's conceptually sound (green <br>is the colour of madness) and it looks good too. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif border=0> <br> <br><i>> Try something wildly asymmetrical (maybe using <br>Alice's line of vision to empasize the title in the <br>opposite corner of the page).</i> <br> <br>I actually started treating the title and author cluster in <br>3D to make it look as if that were the 'Looking Glass' and <br>Alice was looking at it, but that would have taken me <br>way too far. It's a shame, but it can't be helped. <br> <br>Hrant <br> <br><i>> For Mrs Eaves just use InDesign's "optical spacing" and <br>you'll be OK. Please.</i> <br> <br>I know how to whip Mrs Eaves into shape. She's my bitch <br>and she loves it. (Now THAT was rude, sorry'boutthat). <br>Problem is I did this design in Adobe Illustrator. Is it worth <br>transferring the whole shingamading to InDesign? <br> <br><i>And Yves, do remove the trapping from that "A".</i> <br> <br>Heh, cute. I really appreciate you pointing that out. No, <br>really. See? No smiley. Glad you chipped in.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey Yves, I think it's a bit too much information there, and I wonder if there is any way to clean it up a bit. Simplify it. There is too much screaming for my attention here. <br> <br>Just wondering: Why is there info and tickets with different phone numbers for every event, jeez, that is not really user-friendly :-). <br> <br>I'm wondering if the day (vrijdag) isn't a bit too close to the date and if the date per se isn't to big. Mrs. Eaves is overused, but not a bad choice for this job. (The spacing of that IS a bitch, though -- and a job like this is quite worth transferring to Indesign if it's not just that one time you work for the client.) <br> <br>If it IS contemporary classical music, though, I think you should aim for something less retro, cooler, more layered and modern. I don't know if a this kind of retro look sends the right kinda message, but then again I don't know what kind of music is played. This kind of look would be wrong for the likes of Sch</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>> the skew on the title doesn't agree with me... it <br>just looks out of place.</i> <br><i>> Wow, I really like the skewed title.</i> <br>Uh guys, could you try to agree please? <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif border=0> <br>IMO the big plus of this scenario is that it gives a sense <br>of purpose to the whole lay-out, as I explained to <br>Randy earlier on. It conveys the "Through the Looking <br>Glass" symbolically, it creates a narrative as Alice <br>actually looks at the title and it also parallels the <br>whole "skewed reality" concept without having to do <br>anything too literal. <br> <br><i>> the text on the bottom looks really crowded now</i> <br><i>> I agree with Chris, though, that the text at the bottom <br>is too heavy. Would doing it only in the Mrs. Eaves, <br>with caps for months work?</i> <br> <br>Well you can't win them all: the text at the bottom <br>is organized in a calmer fashion (less type sizes, <br>everything flush left, see HD's remark) and most <br>importantly leaves a maximum of white space available <br>for the thing that really needs to catch the eye of <br>the people: the illustration and the title. Setting <br>the dates in Gothic No. 13 allows me to control the <br>focus points: what do people need to learn when they <br>look from a distance? What is going on and when. Once <br>they're interested they can come closer and read the <br>rest of the information. I think it's difficult to do <br>better than that on a small poster (40x60 cm). <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>HD, I really appreciated your remarks too, very insightful, <br>but I'm starting to get the impression I'm spending <br>more time on this thread than actually designing the <br>friggin' thing!

<div class=commentbody> Yves, <br>i agree with chris anemone. the skewed title is out of place with the rest of it. i think it'd be better straight on, not skewed text. <br> <br>i like the top a lot better too. and there's more white space, which is good. but maybe white space under the 3 text blocks, between them and the sponsors at the very bottom? <br> <br>the bottom is very crowded. you use too many different styles too closely together. i can see some cases where you could re-use a style, instead of making a new one. <br> <br>i hope i'm not being too cocky, but i'd like to show you some type i put together for a fake opera ad, for a newspaper, it's small... just to show you a way to have hierarchy, and not too much of a claustrophobic feel. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20593.gif alt="opera ad typography"></div>

<div class=commentbody>> why is it frigid? <br> <br>I guess it's because of the rigidity (in both the font and the grid) and cold open spaces. <br> <br>1) White space is best when it's not white. <br>2) Don't fear complexity - as long as you get information across adequately (never perfectly), complexity makes things worthwhile. Minimalism is for computers, and scared people. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Yves, I use the Mad Tea Party when I use greek text for comps. The lorem ipsum just contains too many characters that the english language doesn't use in proportion. Lorem ipsum doesn't have enough e's and far to many x's and z's. The Mad Tea Party text provides better color and a little smile with a client. Dan</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nice! I usually borrow dummy text from <a href=http://www.alternet.org/ target=_blank> Alternet.org</a> or <br><a href=http://belgium.indymedia.org/ target=_blank> Indymedia</a>. My clients tend to frown... <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif border=0> <br> <br>Here's the end result. THX everyone. And sorry Loren <br>if my comments might have come across as rude: this <br>was never my intention. I really am meek and mild- <br>mannered, and usually have my tongue firmly planted <br>in cheek. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20666.gif alt="Songs from Alice"></div>
