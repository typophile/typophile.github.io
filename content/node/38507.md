  forms?  I now create my own by placing a diagonal line through a Bodoni cap R, but
  would like to just use a single character.\r\n\r\nIs there a symbol font for medical
  caduceus available? (What is the plural of caduceus? Is it caduceuses?)."

    show some samples of this character in use?"

    see it printed on top of my doctor's prescription form that he prints off from
    his laptop, but I've never looked at the font: this is from a privately released
    font in my collection."

  body: "Florian, thanks. I  never would have guessed \"Caducei.\" But then I failed
    Latin when I was 14.\r\n\r\nNow, if someone can tell me where there might be a
    font with medical symbols. Back in the 50s and 60s, ATF sold \"HANDYPACKS\" for
    about $4.00 that contained medical signs among which were \"Recipe symbols,\"
    \"skull & crossbones,\" \"pestle & mortor,\" and a few other symbols. "

  body: "Thanks, Joel -- learn something new every day.  ;-)\r\n\r\nGiven that the
    font I pulled this from is (a) not publicly released, (b) has a wonderful set
    of Regular characters, a more-than-adequate set of Italics, but no bolds, and
    (c) has been personally licenced to me for projects, I'm not surprised that it
    lacks some of the \"social niceties\" when it comes to font conventions.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Joel: The \"response\" symbol is used in church liturgies. The part spoken
    or sung by the pastor is called the \"versicle\" and is symbolized by \u2123 (U+2123).
    The response, marked by \u211F (U+211F), is sung or spoken by the congregation.
    The \"response\" symbol is one up from what is called the \"prescription take\"
    symbol \u211E (U+211E)."
