		<div class="commentbody">I'd like to clarify something. Even if only for myself. It isn't that I wholly disagree with you, Jay, concerning your opinion on type and logos (marks). From where I sit, as a designer, it would be best to always keep in mind the originality ,or lack thereof, of a logo I might design. However, it would do my boss no favor to spend more time than has been allotted per logo. So, if the client's budget is roomy enough for new type, then I would be nuts not to go that route.

		<div class="commentbody">tiffany, budget is most certainly an important issue here but more important is the integrity of the client and designer. the fact is that with experience, custom display type and letterforms are really not that hard to produce. it takes a little while to become accustom to it but it is not very difficult. as a matter of fact, i just finished up a trademark for a client and it took no more then 20 minutes for one mark. trust me, i've taught many students these same skills. it's just a new way of working and seeing typography. you need to remove yourself from the computer for a few rounds. after a few revisions by hand, you can then move to the computer. the trick really is producing a couple of unique letterform directions that speak to the client and then focus your time on the pictographic elements. this is really no different then how you would approach a trademark while using a text face. the difference is the time you would spend putzing around your type collection is spent producing letterforms that do a better job of describing your client in the long run. this is only one of many reasons why you should use custom letterforms. another is the fact that you can work out all the strange and interesting relationships between individual letters more fluidly. a text face can't do this as well. it's letter combinations (except ligatures) are utilitarian. they need to work well with all other letters in the alphabet. the fact is that they don't always do such a great job of this. custom letterforms work in and around each other accenting and stressing or pairing and differentiating with fluid ease. this is why most of the best marks in design were produced in an era where designers could not be lazy. their only option was to produce trademarks by hand. in most cases if you could not do this you had trouble even pursuing a career in design. the computer has really not made this any easier. it has only illustrated the point that a text face is not a display face. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nad x, i'm glad you agree. but the fact is that even with so many text faces to choose from, a text face is still not a display face. realistically though, most people producing and using type are not very type literate and many of the cheesy &quot;typefaces&quot; out there, are in actuality display faces. if you have trouble producing your own type, many of these faces can work with some proper optical adjustments. these sorts of faces can also provide great inspiration. although i would never purchase a &quot;typeface&quot; from t-26, they do in fact have many creative ideas in regard to unique or interesting letterforms. my suggestion is to use these as creative inspiration but not as a final design for a client. as far as the nike mark is concerned don't give it to much credit. the spacings between the &quot;n&quot; &quot;i&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are way to small. that said, the fact is that this mark was most likely done in the way i have described. the version you are speaking of was designed prior to the computer revolution. just because a mark looks simple does not mean it's execution was simple. masterful works usually only look simple. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as a last note (i think i already mentioned this) the use of the word logo is incorrect. logo is short for logotype. a logotype is a word mark. most trademarks are not just word marks. the correct term is trademark with the appropriate abbreviation being mark. this is more then just semantics. it's like calling a bicycle a car. though both are forms of transportation a car is very different from a bicycle. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sorry for the long post&hellip;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">bj, are you kidding me&hellip; i'm amazed that you would pose such a ridiculous question. but to answer, i think you're completely missing the point. no typeface can account for every individual letter pairing possible. this alone should be enough to answer your question but i will go further. because it is really much larger than this.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it really is less crucial that the type is unique in its letterforms (though important, this is only a side benefit). there are plenty of custom or hand done trademarks that use mundane faces like helvetica for instance. because they are done by hand means they are done with a keen sense of artistry, with emphasis placed on the letter pairings found in the word. the time spent crafting each letterform in it's relation to other letterforms pushes these marks into a realm that no type set text face can match. the importance of doing marks by hand goes beyond originality and into craft. it's the fine crafting of each letterform into a piece of display type.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this craft is also about not being lazy. typographers of the past knew many things that we are losing today due to ignorance and computer convenience. the more you discard your craft and treat it idly the more standards of excellence we lose, and the bigger the onslaught of ignorant graphic design hacks we create. if creating a trademark is as simple as turning on my computer and typing out something in a text face, than everyone with a computer and one hundred free typefaces is a graphic designer. all you are doing is making this paradigm more and more acceptable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you may think i'm an idealist but we should all be maintaining these standards. their implementation helps guarantee that we all have jobs.</div>

[ &lt; LOGOTYPE.]&quot; (American Heritage Dictionary, Third Edition) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As &quot;logo&quot; is derived from the word &quot;logotype,&quot; it's important to know that a logotype (in the context of a piece of type) could be a trademark, a stamp, a word, phrase or ligature set in a specific proprietary or nonproprietary typeface. Logos were often made into a single piece of type, hence the term &quot;logotype&quot;. In modern usage, even a proprietary color used in a distinctive way can in some cases carry the effective and legal force of a logo in identity systems. Proprietary fonts are often employed in this manner as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), for example, often omits its famous &quot;eye&quot; logo in printed or broadcast advertising when it would conflict with the design of the piece, instead relying on its use of Didot or other identifying elements to reinforce its corporate identity. (Philip B. Meggs, A History of Graphic Design, Second Edition, 1992, p. 381.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are some of Paul Rand's ideas on the subject of logos, taken from his book, &quot;Design Form and Chaos&quot; (1993): <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Here is what a logo is and does: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A logo is a flag, a signature, an escutcheon, a street sign. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A logo does not sell (directly), it IDENTIFIES. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A logo is rarely a description of a business. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A logo derives its MEANING from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A logo is LESS important than the product it signifies; what it represents is more important than what it looks like. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The subject matter of a logo can be almost anything.&quot; (p. 56. Parentheses and emphasis in original, uppercase substituted here for italics in original.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;A street sign is a kind of logo. Trying to locate an unfamiliar street that has no marker is a bewildering experience. Whether the sign is beautiful or ugly, serif or sans, only the name matters. A logo and a street sign have this in common</div>

		<div class="commentbody">hector,  why'd you read this thread and then waste even more of your time posting to it?  look at the top of your browser there's a back button. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here are a couple of parts from a few reviews i thought some of you might be interested in. it's for a book by William A. Henry, titled &quot;in defense of elitism&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Published prior to the crescendo of criticism against affirmative action and related programs, William Henry's new book suggests an interesting interpretive framework. Put off by the excesses that result from extending good causes to the extreme, Henry focuses attention upon the dialectic between elitism and egalitarianism since World War II. In his view, egalitarianism has triumphed, thereby eliminating the creative tension between the two that fuels progress in American society and culture. To quote him, &quot;the positive side of egalitarianism, the will to tolerance, [must be] coupled with the positive side of elitism, the intellectual suppleness to tolerate and accept diverse elements in society while holding firmly to one's own values'&quot; to sustain the balance (194). With no check on its egalitarian tendencies, American culture loses the capacity to distinguish or to judge among alternatives. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->William Henry was a two time winner of the Pulitzer Prize (once for reporting, once for criticism) and served as Time Magazine's culture critic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wotta coinky-dink! I was directed to this site by a friend in Seattle who's currently also working towards being a graphic designer. We were comparing schools and after hearing gush about her typography class (which apparently was taught by Jay Wilkinson, it was the exact same exercises and the same principles), I was jealous as hell. My typography lessons were a couple weeks doing a letterform and a glossary sheet defining &quot;serif&quot; and &quot;x-height&quot; in an intro to graphic design class. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I may not know a heckuva lot about type (but am taking recommendations for New Orleans area classes/schools), but I do know about umlauts. Well, rock 'n' roll umlauts anyway. Where in any other media an umlaut is a symbol denoting pronunciation (or at least that it is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->foreign-@ss<!-- raw HTML omitted --> word yer looking at), in R 'n' R it simply means that the umlauted band is making claims to RAWK! No pronunciation changes need apply.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Roughs</div>
