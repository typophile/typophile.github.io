  occurred to me that small x height is good for short words because it can emphasise
  word shape. However, characters with small x height blend together over a long word,
  making long word less readable.\r\n\r\nConversely, large x height brings attention
  to individual letters in short words, creating distractions while reading. However,
  the same letter distinctiveness benefits long words because the word retains a distinctive
  readable shape.\r\n\r\nConsequently, a suitable x height might be directly proportional
  to the average word length. Am I talking nonsense? :)"

  body: "I have no idea if your hypothesis is right or wrong, but I think it is a
    great hypothesis as it can be studied and shown to be either right or wrong.\r\n\r\nIt
    is already well known that shorter words are recognized faster than longer words,
    but that is irrelevant to your hypothesis. The question is, if you present shorter
    words with a smaller x-height font, will they be read faster than shorter words
    with a larger x-height font? And if you present longer words with a larger x-height
    font, will they be read faster than the longer x-height words with a shorter x-height?\r\n\r\nWhat
    length words are you imagining for the short and long words? And what fonts are
    you imagining for the small and large x-heights?\r\n"

    in the word have no ascenders or descenders, but this is rare. I am not sure that
    word length alone is a factor in recognition.\r\n\r\nI assume you are aware of
    the term bouma, which is what most scholarly papers use to describe word shape/recognition
    studies. I mention this as it might help you find more references to study. The
    value of Bouma is contentious, with some studies claiming that word shape is irrelevant
    (I do not agree with them, however).\r\n"
