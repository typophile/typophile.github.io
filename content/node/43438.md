body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm still very new here, but have been enjoying the forum
  very much!\r\n\r\nI did a search for \"laser printer\" and read what was there,
  but most of the posts were a little older (for the disposable electronics era...)
  so I thought I'd ask again. I also read some reviews online but they were all too
  disparate to be very helpful. \r\n\r\nI'm just looking for something really inexpensive
  (under $200) to make b+w prints of text. I want to use it as an alternative to the
  photo ink jet that I have at home for looking at typefaces for design projects,
  along with printing things like driving directions. We have \"big\" printers at
  work when I need very high quality output, but I want one at home for a more low-key
  application. I realize the pricing point is low, so I'm not expecting a lot of bells
  and whistles. \r\n\r\nAre there brands to avoid? Any specific models you like? I
  appreciate any input! :) \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nNana"

    highly recommend Ricoh printers, I have the Aficio AP610N, but that's large format
    hence more pricey. Ricoh does make a desktop model - the BP20N - which is under
    $300 (but I don't know about under $200).\r\n\r\nI'd steer clear of HP - they
    use postscript emulation rather than true postscript."

  body: "Oh no, I'm sorry! I saw the HP post after I posted (I was tunnel-visioned
    looking for a general thread instead of specific model comparison). And, my searching
    was poor. \r\n\r\nThank you for recommending the Ricoh and advising against HP.
    I may just have to pay a bit more in the end. \r\n\r\nI appreciate your input
    and links!"

  body: "If your concern isn\u2019t type design but rather something like book or
    poster design, size might be more important than dpi. You can find good second-hand
    A3 b/w laser printers for less than \u20AC250, even with 1200\xD71200dpi."

  body: "Hi Florian, \r\n\r\nThank you for your response. You're right--I'm not a
    type designer; I do primarily ID work and graphic design. I'll definitely keep
    an eye out for a used one. I take it they don't generally get abused or break...so
    if it prints OK, then it should be fine?"

  body: Laser printers last forever. I got one from my old job once, it had been used
    by a department of 8 for years, I got it home and it lasted me another 2 years
    before giving up the ghost. The other thing to bear in mind about laser printers
    is that the toner is expensive but one cartridge will last you for years. And
    the paper is cheap. I'm still on my first cartridge for my Ricoh which I've had
    for 2 years.
