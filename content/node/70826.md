  body: "Just looked at my brush fonts :-)\r\n\r\nYou can either enter a category
    like brush as a search keyword at myfonts.com or look at the themes at dafont.com
    if the font you search is possibly a freebie.\r\n\r\nActually I had an inkling
    it was one of the Letraset brush classics, that helped a lot.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

    usable?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!!!!\r\n\r\nPD: I got so much to learn from the pros
    here ;)"

  body: "Alexandra, \r\n\r\nDo not post links to pirated fonts on Typophile. Thank
    you!\r\n\r\nLET Smudger is a commercial font. You need to hold a license in order
    to use it.\r\nOther designers may be able to provide you with fonts, but they
    can\u2019t grant you the right to use them.  And they most likely violate the
    [[EULA]] by passing on the fonts.\r\n\r\nAndreas (Fontgrube) posted a link to
    one of the distributors where you can purchase a license (and get the necessary
    font files).\r\nRead about <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/content/value/index.html\">the
    value of type</a>.\r\n\r\nF"
