    2 years ago, David Quay and Freda Sack Design were  commissioned by NatWest (via
    Wolff Olins) to design the new corporate identity typefaces for NatWest UK.\r\n\r\nThe
    brief was to produce a face which was friendly and welcoming; modern yet retaining
    some stature. The type designs had to work in a range of media. The distinctive
    designs should help say \"NatWest\" wherever they are seen. As such they have
    now become an integral part of how the NatWest brand is presented to consumers.\r\n\r\nDavid
    Quay & Freda Sack have recently been asked to complete the character set and help
    to improve the font's readability on screen media.\r\n\r\nThe faces are NatWest
    copyright and are jealously guarded."

    then :|. If it's jealously guarded something went very wrong cause I see it everywhere

    find the actual font..."

    We talked about the NatWest-font on other forums, so I remembered that and didn''t

    really is no need to be calling anyone names, so ease up on the \"retarded monkey\"
