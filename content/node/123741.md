  to use my initials of PH and transform them into the cube which I'm almost there
  I think (Cube like a basic 3d object - I want to focus on 3d design :) ). But there
  is still something what I don't see what's wrong. I would like to have same width
  on the top and bottom and between P and H. Technically the P is same like H but
  optically the H looks wider. Also I tried some grid.... \r\n\r\nI'll be happy if
  you can suggest any opinions and ideas what to fix. \r\n\r\nThank you very much."
