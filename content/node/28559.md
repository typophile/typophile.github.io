body: "im looking for typeface that was designed - if i remember correctly - for the
  cover and or logo of a magazine in the 90ies (or end of the 80ies). i think i saw
  it on typophile once, but cant find it anymore.\r\n\r\nits made of straight lines
  and has a similar feeling to <a href=\"http://www.art.ificial.ch/2005/octroy.gif\"
  target=\"_blank\">this typeface</a> i did (but without round elements i think, it
  looked sharper). i thought the name of the magazine was ELEKTRA, but i also remember
  the S, so elektra is probably not right. i think the type was in red on the cover,
  but you see that its quite a distant memory ;)\r\n\r\nany idea?"

  body: no to both. the face isnt straight enough, new socialist is too detailed and
    playful. but brody could be the designer.

  body: "brody was right, i did some google-search on typophile and found it.. the
    tricky thing is, it was a face-cover, but the typeface was in a headline, not
    in the logo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Face842_4651.png]\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/17631\r\n\r\n\"Two
    months later, the typeface later named Industria appeared in the magazine.\" -
    but <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/industria/\">industria on
    myfonts</a>, designed by brody, isnt an exact fit - too round. is it possible
    to buy this typeface (ELECTRO)?\r\n\r\nthank you for your help again, david."

  body: "hmm. \r\n1. is there a similarly condensed typeface in this style available
    digitaly?\r\n2. whats your take of loosely basing a font on those letters for
    a personal project? im not nearly good enough to make a professional typeface
    anyway, so the biggest it could be would be a freefont (but i wouldnt have a problem
    not releasing it). it would just fit a project i had in mind for months. maybe
    asking mr. brody would be a way.\r\n\r\nshall i start a new thread for this in
    the appropriate forum?"

  body: "A font like this is extremely easy to slap together. I did a similar one
    last century (my first and only typeface) based on the lettering of a thriller
    by Mark Folsom. I think I called that one \"Folsom\". It may still be around on
    the web (although that was in its infancy at the time). Don't have it anymore
    myself, sorry\u2026"
