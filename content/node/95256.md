  body: "Could be wrong and probably not the kind of answer you're expecting but looks
    like a mix of fonts. /G and /E are very [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/|Avant-Garde]]
    and /A, /N and /U are \"\xE0-la-Futura\" (the lighter weights). [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface|Neutraface
