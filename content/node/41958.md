  body: These look like receipts which means they are not a font per se but some sort
    of dot matrix printout from the cash register. You should be able to find fonts
    that look like this by doing a search for dot or dot matrix at myfonts.com.

  body: Patty is right. You probably won't find the EXACT match. Much of the type
    that is printed by these machines is not available as a font on your computer.
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Checkout">Checkout</a> is the closest
    thing I know.
