  that the ligatures and alt sorts are there only to emulate the style of writing
  they were aimed at ( perhaps similar to metal type that emulated copperplate connected
  script) or do you think they also improved fit? Not reading it or knowing the forms

  body: "(in haste)\r\n\r\nEben, the question is phrased misleadingly. The typefaces
    were intended to imitate handwriting, and typesetters were expected to make use
    of ligatures (and contractions and abbreviations built on a single sort) to achieve
    the appropriate texture. The same applies to the grec-du-roi. There is ample record
    of other (i.e. not Aldus, or Paulus M, or Estienne) using typefaces cut in the
    same style with fewer ligatures, and the texture in most cases breaks down (See,
    for example, small-format Wetstein books, 1700 onwards). In other words, most
    single-letter sorts were not intended to pair with other single-letter ones, if
    the writing model suggested a ligature and one was provided. \r\n\r\nThere's some
    good attempts at \"normalising\" the typeforms to work without many ligatures
    n the Low Countries that John Lane has written about, and a key development in
    the Foulis Greek cut by Alexander Wilson (relatively easy to see examples of,
    from the middle of the eighteenth century). \r\n\r\nI think there should be some
    good relevant images on the MATD flickr site, from the Greek workshop.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks very much for these rapid answers. And great new resources to follow
    up on. \r\n\r\nI wonder if I should try to clarify the distinction I have in mind
    because to my way of thinking it is still interesting. And if I am misunderstanding
    something I would like to know that too.\r\n\r\nI am going to use connected script
    as my analogy which in and of itself poses some problems but hopefully it will
    be a good vehicle to show the distinction I have in mind. When I look at connected
    latin I can see, among other things, if the script is connecting in a simple manner
    ( low connections ) or a more script like manner which would be a formally more
    accurate reproduction of the original written form. And then quite separate from
    that is the question of how well the glyphs fit. It's true that inevitably there
    are some complex interactions between the two. I don't deny this. But at the same
    time for me it is easy to imagine an old fashioned connected script that connects
    low and is better fitted than a more formally accurate set of connections that
    is less well fit. \r\n\r\nMaybe an even better example would be f ligatures. The
    f ligature can be formally correct in it's construction ( or not ) and at the
    same time either be an improvement over the non-ligated forms ( or not ). \r\n\r\nWhen
    I think about the the complex metal fonts with their many ligatures it seems to
    me that they too might be judged in this way. But maybe this is a mistake.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think?"

    hijacking, but is this the reason for the unneeded ligatures in so many old typefaces?
    I\u2019m not referring to quaints, but to the crash ligatures like ff, fi,fl etc.
    when those letters don\u2019t crash in the first place."

  body: 'The top of the f can be drawn back to avoid all clashes a la metal Linotype
    but I think to they eye of many type people it is not an ideal form. People like
    the f to be fuller. Optically, a fuller f starts to suggest a ligature - or some
    other solution where fit is concerned. It is also true that type is in significant
    thrall to it''s history. Because f ligs were in the writing system that book faces
    come from ( significantly italian humanist manuscript styles ) they were brought
    into the early type. And then because they were in early type they were seen as
    a given. I think they were also associated with quality for some people- rightly
    or wrongly; or even for sophisticated reasons or naive ones. So while I think
    you can say "they don''t have to clash" - saying "they don''t" is not really accurate.
    There is plenty of room for multiple potentially successful approaches to the
    design of "f". '
