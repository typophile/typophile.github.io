    this image, but its a well known brand, used on packaging etc, pretty sure its
    not custom."

  body: "Kev - \r\n\r\nI got the idea from your original post that you were trying
    to match the logo lettering exactly.The logo uses  (intentionally) inconsistent
    lettering, ergo not a findable font. Other materials, such as this,\r\n\r\nhttp://drink-brands.com/drinks/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JohnSmithsBitterAlcoholicDrink.jpg\r\n\r\n
    do use what appears to be a font;   Incidentally, the overall typestyle looks
    very similar to the one used by Stella Artois. Are they related brands?\r\n\r\nOn
    their website and in PDF's and flash files they make extensive use of FranklinGothicITCbyBT
    in a few different weights.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
