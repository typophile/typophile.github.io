  body: The overall squarness of the letters makes them very nice to read on the screen.
    I suspect that it will very very useful for low resolution printers as well.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m not sure that the bowls on the b d h look well with the other curved
    letters like e and c. For example the d and b look heavy next to the e and c.
    Also the k does not fit in well with the others. On the v - z line each letter
    has very different colour from each other.

  body: 'Quite nice, Eduardo. <BR> <BR>I would make the descenders slightly shorter.
    <BR>The main glyph issue I see is the &#34;k&#34;: it&#39;s a bit too mannered.
    On the other hand, the unusual lightness of the upper arm is a readability advantage.
    <BR> <BR>Also, I would make the beak of the &#34;r&#34; much stronger and more
    in character, the &#34;s&#34; narrower, and give the &#34;x&#34; more character.
    <BR> <BR>Spacing: nice and tight, just a bit uneven. The blank space should be
    smaller though. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Good work. <BR> <BR>To me the counter of the &#34;e&#34; is too small, in
    other words the top of the &#34;e&#34; looks too heavy in comparision with the
    other letters. I agree with HHP about the &#34;r&#34; and the &#34;s&#34;. I would
    add a bit of colour to the &#34;x&#34; making its secondary strokes thinner.
