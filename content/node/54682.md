  I'm a third year graphic design student in a five year program where we \"co-op\"
  (like a paid internship) and attend class in alternating quarters. Right now I'm
  in the middle of my second co-op quarter at the only job I've had. When I interviewed
  there, I used a large black case portfolio with acetate pages to showcase my work.
  This was required by our teachers, and all the work was printed full size/originals.\r\n\r\nHere's
  my question: I'm going to be interviewing again in a couple months and it's time
  to start putting together my new portfolio. I have too much to put into a large
  portfolio case, and I would prefer to design the layout for my portfolio and bind
  it into a book. Do you have any advice for a professional-looking student portfolio?
  What would impress you when looking at another designer's portfolio? What are some
  standards for your own? Anything anyone can offer would be appreciated. (I think
  my supervisor might have said 10x15 was a good size but I can't remember! Is this
  a standard size?)"

    like this:\r\nhttp://www.brightorangethread.com/edu/student_work/gd/09-1.html\r\nhttp://www.brightorangethread.com/edu/student_work/gd/21-1.html\r\nhttp://www.brightorangethread.com/edu/student_work/gd/21-2.html\r\n\r\nThese
    examples are built by the student. A book very close to the 10x15. To me there
    is not standard size. It just need to fit on a desk without overtaking the desk,
    big enough to show the work (which might be 75% of original size). Have mocks
    up of each project ready in case they want to see the complete piece.\r\n\r\nBe
    sure to include projects that show you can handle a lot of data. For conference
    you might design the invite/announcement, the program, the signage. You need to
    show depth. Too many portfolio have very short projects, cover and a spread or
    two. Show you can design a book with 10 different spreads (same system of course)."

    high-concept work that will get you a job at a boutique design firm will flop
    hard at conservative in-house job interviews. Either use a solution that allows
    you to change out the pages or have more than one portfolio. '

  body: Wow, thanks for your responses - all really good advice. Those books look
    like quite a challenge. I have bound a book before, though, so I think I can do
    it.
