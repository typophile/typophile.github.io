  same size as it is on Fontlab, covering just one line but for some reason it gets
  way too big when I use the font, what dictates it's size? The values I input on
  the Key Dimensions? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/probfont_3891.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  left G is what I get on Illustrator, the right G is what I get on Fontlab (which
  is what I intend).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? \r\n\r\nThanks"

    soon as I checked that I realized the problem must be related to having the values
    on automatic, right?\r\nI've thought about changing the values but I have no idea
    what all those fields mean."

    at harmonising your overall metrics. There is a very comprehensive guide by Karsten
    Luecke that will give you a good grounding in this area:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm\r\n\r\nIt
    is well worth checking out his guide to font naming as well.\r\n\r\nWhat is the
    UPM currently set to?"
