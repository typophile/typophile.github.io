  body: "Florian,\r\n\r\nIt sure looks like Compacta, like Tiffany suggested.  The
    baselines have been shifted on the letters, and it could've been photoshopped
    or printed (low quality, or special paper) to get the rougher effect."

  body: You could always use <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/2005/10/how_to_create_a.cfm#21">this
    technique</a> to roughen up Compacta.
