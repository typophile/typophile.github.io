    There is of course \r\nthe sience of well kerning possible, but I can`t see \"bugs\".
    Probably in ground of \"F\" where it is a bit too thin, even you scale it to small.
    So it would \"breake\" on small sizes on screen."

  body: "For me the F looks quite stiff and 'leant-in' next to the more casual looking
    other characters, the stress on the swash of the c is a bit off and the dot on
    the i is a bit 'comic'. Otherwise a very good looking logo.\r\nTim"

  body: "It's well done, Chuck, and I agree with a few of the comments above.\r\n\r\nMy
    small suggestions is to watch out for the very slight downward decline of the
    optical baseline. In handwriting styled faces and logos a downward arch or baseline
    connotes depression and pessimism by handwriting analysis.\r\n\r\nYou can improve
    the subliminal signal by giving it a slight incline, or raise the last character
    \"n\", or by slightly rotating the entire logo counterclockwise by just a few
    degrees.\r\n\r\nThis is less of a pure design critique and more about the power
    of creating symbols and marks."
