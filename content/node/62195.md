body: "I am doing up some citations on various typefaces, and occasionally it seems
  as if a typeface may have been essentially \"self-published.\" Is that the case
  for Frederic Goudy's [[Goudy Sans]]? Or was it perhaps issued by [[Lanston Monotype|Lanston]]?\r\n\r\n(Pfeh,
  if I had unpacked my copy of McGrew's \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth
  Century\" since the move, I could figure this out in a jiffy, but I can't find it
  right  now.)\r\n\r\nT"

  body: 1930, Lanston Monotype, according to MacGrew. He started work on it in 1922
    and they persuaded him to finish it in 1929.
