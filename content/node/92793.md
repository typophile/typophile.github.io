body: "I work on a typeface, so far I've drawn the extreme font (ultra thin, light
  and Ultra) in roman and italic. I've also done the spacing, feature and kerning.
  I know that I can import the feature from a font to an other and that works well.
  What I tried is to use my kerning from my light italic to become my basic one for
  my ultra thin and ultra. Can I do that, if so how?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: In FontLab, the Metrics panel can save/open AFM files for standard kerning.
    For class-based kerning, the menu in the Classes panel can copy classes between
    fonts; then just copy your kern feature in the OT panel.
