  exactly which typefaces were analyzed for the drawing of Univers' signs, can anybody
  help me please?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Hi Christopher!\r\n\r\nI'm sorry on posting here after such long time.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the Frutiger's experiment, i meant the construction of a typeface based on analyzing
    the structure of established old style typefaces to get a \"spine\". I understand
    that this spine was the basis for his sans serif and very famous typography: Univers.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure if this is right, or what part is; plus I want to recreate this exercise,
    to learn of his method and know more about a well known typeface.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    that's what I want: an exercise, not precisely an experiment.\r\n\r\nSaludos!"

  body: That sounds like a very worthwhile exercise. Will you post your findings here?

  body: "Jesus, I think you may have things in the wrong order regarding Univers and
    the \"experiment,\" by which I take you mean the famous illustration in <em>Type-Sign-Symbol</em>
    that superimposes eight of Frutiger's typeface to reveal their mostly shared structure
    (or spine). This generated letter \"a\" does look similar to Univers' \"a.\" \r\n\r\nThe
    illustration, as far as I am aware, was created by Frutiger in 1980; Frutiger
    started designing Univers in 1953. Moreover, Univers is used as one of the eight
    overlaid typefaces.\r\n\r\nSo the exercise was one Frutiger did later in his career
    to show the common elements in his work, not as a basis for designing any typefaces.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
    it would certainly be a worthwhile exercise to try overlapping typefaces as you
    propose. "
