  cap or a small cap? I\u2019ve seen it done both ways and I\u2019m not sure if this
  is a stylistic treatment or typographically correct. Thoughts?"

  body: "You could make this through by Open Type setting but I guess the simiplest
    way for get that could be selecting the specific letters of the sentence and then
    apply the respective command in each software editor.\r\nIf you need more details
    about that just ask for it, but it's not so simple if you pretend go for code
    way.\r\nI think all depends of your targets.\r\n\r\nRegards"
