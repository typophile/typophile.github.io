  books, found one set in a typeface that looked fantastic, and it was id'd as Bookman
  in the id forum. I believe it is Bookman oldstyle. \r\n\r\nThe book is a collecton
  of short horror stories, trade paperback. I've searched through suggestions for
  book fonts, but bookman old style is not on any of those list. Is there any drawbacks
  to using this font, or any reason it shouldn't be used? I've only seen it used in
  the one book. I really seem to be attracted to thicker, chunkier fonts for long
  passages of text. Any other suggestions if this isnt a good one to use?\r\n\r\nI
  printed out a few pages, 10pt seemed too small and 11pt too big. 10.5 looked just
  right. Is it okay to use half sizes?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd like a typeface suggestion
  for the story title pages that would compliment well. Probably somewhat condensed
  as some of the titles are long. I was thinking Bodoni condensed, but seems I'm always
  using that. \r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions!"

    right, go with it. Nothing wrong with half sizes.\r\n(b) Not sure that a Bodoni
    is gonna go well for the title pages: I'd have thought a low-contrast sans-serif,
    something with shortish ascenders/descenders will match Bookman OS better...\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure the pros will have something more specific to suggest. :-D\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver

    questions :)\r\n\r\nSo, any specific suggestions for the titles? I've looked through
    several short story collections, but nothing has really struck me.\r\n\r\nI'm
    a little lost, since this is rather new to me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I say if half point looks good, then go for it. The problem with clunky fonts
    on large amounts of text is it becomes a little hard to read after a while, it's
    almost like a workout. If you give enough space in between the lines maybe it
    will work better. Try checking out Baskerville.It's still sort of thick but a
    well known good reader font.\r\n\r\nAs for titles...I'm partial to trade gothic
    or franklin gothic. They both have condensed versions and contrast well to the
    serif text fonts."

  body: "I don't think Bodoni would work with Bookman at all. I must confess to finding
    Bookman a little dated but what's old always becomes new again. It is fine to
    use half sizes, I do it all the time. \r\n\r\nFor your headers, why not something
    more fun given it's a horror book? House Industries Monster fonts is one way to
    go, or something spiky and gothic. If you don't want to go campy with it, I agree
    that a sans serif is a better idea than trying to find another serif that works
    with Bookman."
