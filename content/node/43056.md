  heh), but if anyone can identify it, it would be a great help.\r\n\r\nWe had a graphic
  design firm do a logo for us originally, (who have since gone out of business) and
  they provided practically everything BUT the font to us.\r\n\r\nIt bears a close
  resemblance to OCR A and OCR A II, but as you can see it's not quite right.\r\n\r\nPlease
  help!"

    the logo.\r\nCould have started out as <a href=\"http://myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/russell-square/\">Russell
