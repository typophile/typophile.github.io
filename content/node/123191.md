    by  khtt.org are a valuable resource that deals with various aspects of VOLT.
    Not kerning specifically but they may help you figure it out.\r\n http://www.khtt.net/page/31752/en\r\nHasan
    Abu Afash of Hiba Studio in Gaza is highly recommended as a real professional
    expert of Volting Arabic, including kerning.  I am sure he can answer you despite
    the sad loss he suffered during the recent war - house damaged and brother killed
    in another incident...\r\nhttp://hibastudio.com/\r\nVladimir"
