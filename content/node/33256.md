  body: "The <strong>west elm</strong> identity looks like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/light/\"><strong>Interstate</strong>
    Light</a> on their website \u2013 what you have above is different though (<em>or</em>
    perhaps I\u2019m looking at the wrong <a href=\"http://www.westelm.com\">west
    elm</a> website).\r\n\r\nI\u2019d agree with Patty that <strong>WILLIAMS-SONOMA</strong>
    does look like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/new-century-schoolbook/\"><strong>New
    Century Schoolbook</strong></a>, but it\u2019s weight has me looking at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/augustea-bq\"><strong>Augustea</strong></a>,
    much of a muchness really."

  body: The <em>w</em>, <em>e</em> and <em>t</em> in <strong>west elm</strong> above
    look remarkably like <strong>Tarzana Narrow</strong> Regular. The remainder, however,
    are quite different.
