body: I posted this a couple days ago in General Discussions and had no reply, and
  have still not been able to resolve the problem. Please help! Thank you! &#40;Sorry
  to duplicate here, but I figure the tech experts are more likely to see it.&#41;
  <BR> <BR>Using TypeTool 2 on a Mac to edit a Type 1 font. Replacing circumflexes
  with macrons and that&#39;s all. But when I regenerate the font, I get reflow problems
  in the original InDesign CS doc.  <BR> <BR>I am not touching metrics, and the reflow
  affects even portions of text that do not use any edited characters. The numerical
  metrics settings on the original and edited fonts are the same as far as I can tell.
  Does anyone have an idea as to what causes this and how I can make it not happen?  <BR>
  <BR>I used to do this all the time in Fontographer &#40;much more complicated to
  use&#41; and had other problems but not reflow. Thanks for any suggestions -- hope
  they come in soon!

  body: Peter, <BR> <BR>Just a thought. If you, for example, opened printer font file
    but not suitcase file with TypeTool you could loose metrics and kerning information.
    <BR>Nobody can tell you the real cause of the problem without looking at the source
    and the output fonts.
