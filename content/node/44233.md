body: "Im sure this question has been asked many times here before, but im still going
  to ask.\r\n\r\nI haven't cut a font for a few years, I used Fontographer previously,
  and found it a bit clunky and illogical at times, but it was all that was there
  and i got good results.\r\n\r\nBut i'd like to start designing type again properly
  and am looking at software, I will create the vector files in Adobe Illustrator
  (post pen) but would like to know what people recommend for the final steps in the
  process.. having nosed around and downloaded a few demos, Fontographer seems no
  different to the old version, and Fontlab seems to have quite a nice bezier curve
  editing system, but without using either for a decent project or two its really
  hard to make a choice.\r\n\r\nso basically, is it just a choice between these two,
  or is there any good software i've not come across? Im not worried about the cost
  (within reason) as its just one computer. so what does anyone recommend.\r\n\r\n(sorry
  for the dull question)\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I was in your position about a year ago. I hadn't messed with font making
    for about 15 years, and suddenly I caught the bug again. Fontographer had a new
    version for the Mac, so I took it as an omen and bought the upgrade. I had created
    several alphabets in Illustrator, but found it tedious to get the glyphs into
    Fontographer. Cut and paste didn't work - possibly because my version of Illustrator
    is old. Fontographer also lacked the ability to create OpenType fonts, and that
    was a feature I really wanted. I ended up getting the upgrade to FontLab Studio,
    and I haven't regretted it.\r\n\r\nI still do my preliminary work in Illustrator,
    and it's very easy to paste the glyphs into FontLab. Most users say they prefer
    to do everything in FontLab so I may change my methods one day. Not yet though.
    \r\n\r\nLeslie Cabarga's book,  [[http://www.logofontandlettering.com/bookorder.html|Learn
    FontLab Fast]] was a big help with the learning curve."
