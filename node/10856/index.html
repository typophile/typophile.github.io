I'm going to look into working that in to version 1. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also the modulation you suggested was what I naturally went for at first but I thought that it was detracting from the mark, but that was on much earlier and rougher versions, and I've been thinking I'd look into it again.

Is this what you mean? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, good call on Isadora, it was the face I looked at most when coming up with this. I have tried it for &quot;photography&quot; but the client is really not into it. He feels it is just what you would expect. I think it goes well with the mark but am with him on not using it (or any other scripts). Especially since the bold weight of Isadora seems the best match and is overpowering to the name. But if anyone feels that the helvetica is quite an eyesore in this please speak up. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the critique.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Mitchell, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think you're off to a lovely start with the mark and agree it would look excellent embossed. I'd like to speak to the text for a minute. I think there are a three issues to consider: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) I thing you've got too many styles working in one logo. There's the script mark, the serif name, and sans photography. I think you would do well to limit the design in this regard.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Given that your mark is really calligraphic with diagonal stress and large variance in stroke weight, It probably makes sense to choose a serif type with similar properties. One that comes to mind that would keep the feel of what you've got going is Poetica small caps (I wouldn't use any of the swashes, keep it simple and let your mark do the talking). As an alternative, maybe try a script. While I can see the why Hrant would point you towards Isadora, in this case I think its the wrong choice. I'd first try a spencerian script. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) I think the current arrangement of mark and logotype are out of proportion/position. In a mark-on-left arrangement, I'd reduce it's size by at least 70%. Also try a centered arrangement. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On a side note, two fashion faces that come to mind that are at least as prolific as helvetica&hellip; Optima and Didot, neither of which would work with your mark. (So helpful!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, I don't mind the heavier circle/O. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good Luck, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Randy <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

I know that Brian is quite pleased (settled) with Candida for the name (so am I, by itself at least) Though other fonts better match the mark.

I'm definetly still trying to figure it all out though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in case anyone's interested, a little history to show how I arrived here: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First came the wordmark because Brian and I had agreed that most important was his name and it should be able to stand alone. A mark would be great but just a name would be fine. What Brian was looking for was coming out of the advertisements in the magazine <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elegant Bride<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and logotypes like Gucci, Armani, Donna Karan. Think the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Luxury collection<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Orange Italic. I showed a few faces and a few marks but no marks grabbed him, and the Candida mark was what he liked. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then on the business cards and such, we needed to identify what he offered. So &quot;photography&quot; was added (but should not have to appear everyhere his logo does).

		<div class="commentbody">Ohhhh. Nice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can see what you mean about such a thin vertical for the B.

		<div class="commentbody">I think that the double line problem has been solved. My original thought was the the thin line was creating a problem next to the thicker line. However, now that we've seen that a double line, of the same thickness, can be very nice with the added bonus of getting a hint of your original idea.</div>
