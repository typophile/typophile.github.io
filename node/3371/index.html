It's more common to use stickers based on themes (Halloween, My 18th Birthday, etc.).

		<div class="commentbody">Typespotting at a craft store is amusing (well, possibly).  Besides the scrapbooking section, there are rubber stamps, wall stencils, etc.  You can play spot-the-Lithos-knockoff or wonder why letters with dots at the terminals are popular so long after Tekton's heyday.  I've often wondered if any of these products were from licensed designs.  (Any success stories?) <BR> <BR>I'm having difficulty understanding how a EULA would prevent someone from, say, collecting all the nearby lost cat posters to obtain Comic Sans in A-Z, then creating the scrapbooking dies from those.  What am I missing?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding the Starbucks/P22 Cezanne problem&hellip; <BR> <BR>My opinion is that as long as somebody purchases the the proper license for the number of CPUs/devices/whatever, I don't care how extensively they use it. In fact, I hope they use it as much as possible and as <i>visibly</i> as possible because in my experience there is a direct relationship between how often people see a font and how well it sells. Is it just a coincidence that P22 Cezanne is the best-selling P22 font at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bestsellers.html" target="_blank">MyFonts</a>?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Richard, I agree with you about derivative works and getting the proper license to begin with.  <BR> <BR>What I meant was, I don't think I would try to sell a special &quot;large scale&quot; license. If somebody buys a font and uses it in some &quot;large scale&quot; way in, say, an ad campaign, I'm getting more than the license fee from them already.
