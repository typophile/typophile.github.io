body: Typographic logo for Rubicon Design &#43; Fabrication designed July 2001. This
  was <BR>cut-up letterforms /work in progress  I was experimenting with when the
  client dropped by the studio, looked at it and wanted it as is.. Their slogan is
  &#34;more custom than your mom&#34;. All collateral &#40;postcard, letterhead, fax
  cover sheet, businesscards, website&#41; all use various version of the logo. <BR>
