body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI'm designing a magazine for the caravan club of Australia (very
  exciting project!). Anyway I'm struggling with concepts for the logo, I'm trying
  to give them a contemporary feel. but with a fun element. Also it needs to be full
  of character as their cover images are very, very dull.\r\n\r\nFirst thoughts were
  the old favourite Helvetica neue black italic cond. but it looks too much like a
  car magazine. I like the idea of a slab serif like memphis, but it doesn't sit well
  with the style. Every serif I try looks incredible dated - and I am committed to
  a logo in upper and lowercase for legibility.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest what might
  work with the word 'Caravanner' - I know it's an ugly word...\r\n\r\nThanks"

    a complementary font for body copy though - any notions?"

    needs.
