body: "I'm curious of the perspective on building Stylistic Alternates into a font.
  I have a typeface that I would like to have an alternate 'O' that wouldn't have
  a corresponding spot in my font glyph window in the way that 'Oslash', as an alternate
  does.\r\n\r\nI'm new to this, but in this situation is the way to go about it to
  just create a new glyph and name it something unique that relates to my alternate
  character?, since, in this situation this is a completely original character that
  I want to be accessed as an open type feature just to change up the style of the
  font if desired.\r\n\r\nI have other fonts that I would like to do this with in
  the future containing multiple sylistic characters?\r\n\r\nI'm curious how this
  is done since what I'm doing isn't an alternate in terms of being small caps or
  swash characters just creatively a unique variation on one particular character
  and in the future multiple characters with unique variations.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your input.\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: "Just to to clarify, 'Oslash' is a unique character, just like \"Oacute\"
    etc.\r\n\r\nThe unique name should be \"O.something\" where \"something\" is whatever
    you want.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend using the \"stylistic sets\" features such as 'ss01',
    because you'd probably want the same effect to work on accented O's as well, and
    it's nice to be able to apply something like this on a whole block of text. So
    you'd also have \"Odieresis.something\" and so on.\r\n\r\nYou don't necessarily
    need to encode the alternate glyphs at all, or if you do encode them, use PUA
    (Private Use Area) codepoints, as discussed in another current thread.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

    of how it could apply to the other \"O\" characters as well. Thanks for the advice!\r\n\r\nMike"
