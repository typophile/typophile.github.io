  is a hand made M\xE9cane-Manuaire hybrid typeface created using the iPad. It is
  part of an ongoing personal project that I am working on currently to create a set
  of fonts using the touchscreen interface, some of which I aim to re-work into pro-versions
  over the coming months. The font is available for all to use for free and can be
  downloaded via the link below.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.helveticbrands.ch/portfolio/typography/hinwil|Download

  whilst traveling across the country on meetings. Just a personal project but thought
  I would share with the community.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nDavid Pache"
