body: "I am looking for a font similar to SF Movie Poster for headlines and pulled
  quotes to be used in a high school yearbook. My only problem with SF Movie Poster
  is that it does not come in any variations, so I would really like a font with at
  least 6 weight options. My other concern is budget. Being a high school in this
  economic situation means that we have no budget for anything extra, so the font
  will be funded by staff members. I'd love to keep it as close to $200 or less if
  possible, but if there's a free font out there, all the better!\r\n\r\nBelow you
  can see what I'm generally going for design wise. I have considered fonts like Helvetica
  Condensed Bold, Black, and other variations, but I'm not a fan of the R's. I really
  want something really crisp and clean like SF Movie Poster.\r\n\r\nI'm also looking
  for a different body copy font to try out. Currently, I'm using Serifa, but we've
  used Arno Pro (because of the millions of variations that it has) and san serifs
  along the lines of Franklin Gothic in the past as well. I'm not sold on using a
  san serif because I'm already using two others for headlines and subheads, but suggestions
  would be awesome!"

  body: "Thanks, ralphsmouse! I really like Trade Gothic, League Gothic, and Sentinel.
    Steelfish is really nice, too, but unfortunately our newspaper publication uses
    it sometimes so that one's out of the question.\r\n\r\nSentinel is definitely
    on my wish list. It's beautiful."
