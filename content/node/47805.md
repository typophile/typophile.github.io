body: "Respected Sir,\r\nI am developing a Quranic Font. Here in the Quranic Script
  there are two shapes of Dammatan, two of Fathatan and two of kasratan. But in unicode
  there are only one position for these shapes.\r\nI need two shapes for fathatan,
  dammatan and kasratan.\r\nI try to achieve the second option, I make three shapes
  for them and put them in seperate glyph.\r\nI tried to achieve this glyph or shape
  using ccmp feature, NOT WORKED, I tried to use this by mkmk, NOT WORKED, I tried
  through Cursive attachment, NOT WORKED, I tried some more logics but failed.\r\nSome
  Aeraab's (diacritics) are working on each other but I need when I press fatha fatha
  it replaces my required glyph.\r\n\r\nCan I achieve this. I am trying to do this
  in MS Word now.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    \r\n\r\nI will request experts to please discuss whether these type of checks
    (Grammar or Spell) should be made at Uniscribe level? My personal opinion it should
    not. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nBest Regards,\r\nAtif Gulzar\r\n\r\nI \u25D8\u25D8\u25D8\u25D8

    level, and never miss an opportunity to tell Microsoft this. However...\r\n\r\nIn
    the case of the different kinds of dammatan, fathatan and kasratan in Quranic
    typesetting, these have been proposed for distinct encoding in Unicode and are
    likely to be approved."
