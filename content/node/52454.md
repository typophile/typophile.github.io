  the font? This seems to happen in gothic faces and slab faces, especially when the
  1 has a prominent base of its own. Here\u2019s a sample from ITC Franklin Gothic:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wtf2_5243.png]"

  body: "I'm not sure, but I think it might have to do with the integrity of the spine
    / curve.\r\n\r\nIf it's the same thickness as the other horizontals, the spine
    gets heavier, or when keeping it the same weight, the apex has to extend further
    in to the left, making the place where the spine connects to the base very thin.
    I hope that makes sense. Just a thought.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the example you have
    given, the difference is quite small..."

  body: Interesting. It seems the spine -- or whatever you want to call it -- of the
    2 did become thinner because of it.

  body: "James -- To the extent that what you say is true in some faces, it's probably
    a vestige of the characteristics of more contrasted styles. If you reflect for
    a moment on the equivalent features in a typical serif, you'll recognize that
    the base of the two is a broad stroke (like the top of a 5 or 7), whereas the
    base of the 1 is a set of serifs (like I or l) and the base of an L is a thin
    horizontal (like E or Z). In a contrasted scheme, of course, all three of these
    will be different, with the 2 being the heaviest.\r\n\r\nSo, to the extent that
    a sans style has any slight contrast, you may find some of these same differences
    showing up. I'd be curious about an equivalent comparison between the top horizontals
    of 5 7 E T and Z.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em>a vestige of the characteristics of more contrasted styles</em>\r\n\r\nI'd
    say it's inherent to figures.\r\nFirstly, there is the tendency of the eye to
    prefer horizontal strokes to be slightly thinner than verticals--this predisposes
    type to stroke contrast.\r\nHowever in comparison with letters, figure shapes,
    whether oldstyle or lining, are narrower, more even in width, and lack word-shape
    distinction (i.e. any combination is meaningful).\r\nGiven those constraints of
    basic form, if the principle \"vertical thick, horizontal thin\" were applied
    consistently to the contrast of figures, numbers would look really nasty, with
    lots of hot spots.\r\nTherefore, the idea of a \"Baroque\" (mixed angles of stress,
    according to Bringhurst) pen ductus is particulary suitable to figures.\r\nThe
    majority of typographic genres, even sans serif, have vertical/horizontal stroke
    contrast, especially in the heavier weights, where it is useful in accomodating
    an even appearance of stroke weight and colour between open and busy letters. "
