    joint! And it was such an easy one. That darn \"R\" is what cost me a couple of
    minutes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here is the link I was about to post before I was so badly
    beaten to the punch:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-avant-garde-gothic/\r\n\r\nWell,
    at least on the bright side I still have something to aim for in life. Everest,
    I will conquer ye yet!"

  body: "Thanks, Lex, I truly appreciate that. I know that a million others could've
    ID'd this very easily, probably with their eyes closed, so it was a matter of
    being very lucky to post first. Even at that, I had a hard time finding a matching
    R. I wasn't quite sure if it was the Bold or Alternates version and it took a
    matter of minutes for me to figue it out. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I would be thrilled
    to one day give back the help I've so generously received from this Forum. I realize
    an Avant Garde ID ain't exactly earth shattering, but ya gotta start somewhere!
    \r\n\r\nThanks again."
