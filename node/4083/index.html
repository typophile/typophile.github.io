<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>There's something in Adobe Illustrator CS that drives me <br>absolutely freakin' <i>NUTS</i> and that's the fact that text anchor <br>points seem to have lost their "snap to" ability. I hope this is just <br>a setting and not due to the completely reworked type engine. <br> <br>I often have short bits of text as independent units (without text <br>box) and used to snap the anchor point to corner or center <br>points of objects. Now this doesn't seem to work anymore. <br>Anyone knows what happened? I've looked in the preferences <br>and couldn't find any setting that might be responsible for this.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I did some reading on this in Adobe's forums. <br>Other people are pretty upset about it too and <br>it doesn't seem like there is much of a fix yet. <br> <br>The way it works is that the arbitrary place in <br>which you click your cursor inside an object is <br>the spot that snaps to guides, not the outside <br>bounds of the object itself. So, short of <br>grabbing as close to the edge of an object or <br>text unit as you can, there isn't much you can <br>do with Snap to Guides. <br> <br>Try turning on the Snap to Grid. That is the only <br>way I could get what you are attempting to work.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well bugger me senseless! When I click in the near vicinity of an <br>anchor point, I want that precize anchor point to be selected and <br>"magnetized", not the near vicinity. What kind of reasoning went <br>into that daft decision?!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Doesn't turning on 'Smart Guides' allow you to select the point directly? I use them all the time, because they tell you what you'll select and snap to (point, line, intersection, etc.). <br> <br>Cmnd + U should turn them on. Although, I admit I use AI 10 at work more than CS at home, so this may not be the solution.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Adobe should have stopped at Illustrator 8.0 and simply add the transparency and the wrap envelope features. Everything else has completely mocked up the program. <br> <br>At work I still use OS 9.2 with Illustrator 8, at home I have Illustrator 10 only because I have OS X only. I de-installed all CS applications (except InDesign) because they suck. <br> <br>Sorry, end of rant.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have the impression I haven't made myself entirely clear about <br>what exactly I meant, so please bear with me while I try to explain <br>it in a better way. From the Illustrator Help File: <br> <br>When dragging objects, the Snap to Point command helps you <br>align your cursor with anchor points and guides in the document <br>window. Snapping occurs when the cursor is within 2 pixels of <br>the point or guide. <br><i>Important: Snapping alignment depends on the position of the <br>cursor, not the edges of the dragged object.</i> <br> <br>To snap to anchor points and guides: <br> <br>1. Choose View > Snap to Point. A check mark indicates that <br>snapping is turned on. <br> <br>2. Select the object you want to move. <br> <br>3. Position your cursor on the exact point you want to align with <br>anchor points and guides, and hold down the mouse button. <br><i>For example, if you want to align the corner point of a rectangle <br>with a guide, click down exactly on the corner point.</i> <br> <br>4. Drag the object to the desired location. When your cursor <br>comes within 2 pixels of an anchor point or guide, it snaps to <br>the point. <br><i>The pointer changes from a filled arrowhead to a hollow arrowhead <br>when a snap occurs.</i></div>

<div class=commentbody>Now point 3 is utter bollocks when it comes to text anchor points. <br>When I want to have the anchor point of the text snapping to an <br>anchor point of an object, I click the text object anchor point, <br>drag it till it snaps to that anchor point. One would assume that <br>both text anchor point and "snap-to point" are then positioned <br>perfectly on top of each other. BUT when I enlarge it appears <br>that this is <i>never</i> the case, even if I try at 6400%! <br> <br>If I try it the other way round and drag an object by its anchor <br>towards the anchor point of the independent text object, it does <br>not snap. So this means text anchor points have completely lost <br>their "magnetic" abilities! For what reason? It worked fine and it <br>was a really helpful feature. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif alt=:-( border=0></div>
