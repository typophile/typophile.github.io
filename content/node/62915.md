  some feedback? Also any suggesting to how I might apply color would be very helpful!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bookcarousel_4560.jpg]"

  body: "this is pretty rough, but what do you think of this? When I saw the book
    icon you designed I immediately though of the top of a carousel. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/book_5001.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    think you need to adjust the letter spacing.. a lot. Also, I don't really like
    the O's. I think it would look better if the O's were more round. That way it
    would create a repetition with the O in the icon.\r\n\r\nJust a thought."
