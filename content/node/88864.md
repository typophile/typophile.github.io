  body: "Dick, I'm curious where you get these unusual matches \u2013 while FF Good
    seems a good match for /WALKER/ (once you squoosh it slightly and remove a bit
    from the bottom of each character), the other two are (a) some cut of Times New
    Roman* (with slight curve changes) and (b) A Neo-Grotesque that almost, but not
    quite, appears to be either Univers or Helvetica Neue (Note the /M/ width and
    the /C/ terminals) but could conceivably be based on either.** I've seen you propose
    strange clones and unusual cuts of well-known faces before.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming
    you're using some sort of software?\r\n\r\n* In fact, on the version you linked
    to, it says so right on the page!\r\n** Your version appears to be a clone of
    Helvetica Neue Extended."

  body: "I am using Find My Font software for the matching (findmyfont.com, $69!).\r\n\r\nI
    present the user's sample, select the characters to scan and wait minute for the
    list of \"Best Matches\". I have to pick and choose as the program doesn't detect
    key nuances of shape. If the results are wrong, I re-choose which letters to scan
    and redo. I should end up with a group which matches the sample. This list will
    include all sorts of manipulated clones, scones and two-tones! I have learned
    to try to pick the one on \"everybody's list\", such as Myfonts, Dafont, Designer's
    or Foundry's web site, etc. Google works.\r\n\r\nIn my defense, I've been collecting
    fonts since grammar school so have a huge number of 10,000 fonts for $1. I have
    not deleted anything except for duplicates based on font name. The filtering process
    at the end (finding a web site for purchase) hopefully gets me back into tolerable
    territory.\r\n\r\nFurther defense is I am not a designer by any stretch of imagination.
    I can't draw, sketch or even doodle. I can barely hold a pencil! I've not been
    brought up \"in the trade\" so I don't know the terminology and I don't know design
    or style genealogy. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I hope I'm learning the discipline
    to completely match the user's sample regardless of the font source. Therefore,
    clones can be good when they fit better.\r\n\r\nDick\r\n\r\n\r\n"
