  i've got the measure of VOLT, but a friend trying to install the resulting files
  on his shiny new Mac is getting an 'opentype data missing' warning, whether they're
  .ttf, or saved-as .otf ...  Something's evidently gone wrong (whether or not the
  warning indicates a genuine serious problem)\r\n\r\ni'm strongly fearing that i
  should have bought FontLab... evidently VOLT doesn't restructure .ttf files (???).
  I tried Crossfont on them, but it produced a .dfont file..... that didn't work either.\r\n\r\nam
  i missing one link here or a whole chain of them? i peeked at the adobe font kit,
  but i'm no way clever enough to grapple with it.... i can't stretch to another font-making
  product... can anyone advise? is there any lightweight hand coding that i could
  do to complete the files?\r\n\r\nmy website ( in disguise ) : www.jelly_ _ _ _hedge.com\r\n"

    an old one. he sounds so unhappy about it! i'm <em>dying</em> to know what he
    ought to do!\r\n\r\nI had a cat called TTF, and <em>he</em> went missing one day.
    though maybe that's a little off-topic ;-) "

  body: "I am not sure what would cause the 'Missing OpenType data' for an OTF, but
    I know that TrueType fonts which lack a 'fpgm', 'cvt ', or 'prep' table will generate
    that in Font Book under OS X 10.4. This has been confirmed as being a bogus error;
    as this condition is common in unhinted TrueType fonts. You can avoid the error
    by generating TTF with hints; or just ignore the error and install the font anyway.\r\n\r\nIt
    would not surprise me if there's something similar going on for OTFs (i.e. a table
    that Font Book is assuming should be there but isn't generated by default)."

  body: "ok, thank you .. \r\nthe font <strong>is</strong> unhinted: but it is smoothed...
    \r\nis it possible dyou think to open the font in notepad - lets say - and paste
    minimal versions of the appropriate tables in? just to say \"no hinting required\"
    ... or is that a ridiculous idea and beneath contempt... \r\n?\r\nhinting is supposed
    to be horribly complex.. and in any case the programme i have doesnt help achieving
    it. "

    extremely advanced version of Notepad, there is no way you could effectively edit
    the font data there.\r\n\r\nThere should be some kind of option in Font Creator
    to export hinted TrueType."

  body: "no, i know that much, at least, about hinting. \r\n\r\nFontCreator calls
    it gridfitting, and smoothing 'greyscale rendering' . i checked the combined 'gridfitting
    and greyscale' for the font at all sizes. gridfitting does occur on my PC if i
    ask for it, despite there being no hinting procedure.  ... <em>very confusing</em>.
    \r\n\r\nbut i don't want to malign FontCreator, which is an ace programme. i just
    don't know what i'm doing with it. \r\n"

  body: "It sounds like you're talking about the 'gasp' table settings. The 'gasp'
    table controls sizes at which the rasterizer will apply gridfitting, <em>if the
    font contains hints</em>, and greyscaling (antialiasing) under Windows (no effect
    under Mac OS as far as I know). If the font does not contain hints, then the gridfitting
    setting will have no effect (there are no hints to apply). But this setting does
    not control whether the font contains hints to begin with.\r\n\r\nBack to the
    issue of the Font Book validation error, you can safely ignore that if the font
    is otherwise okay (check out Microsoft's Font Validator if you haven't already);
    it's a bogus error. But if you want to eliminate the error from appearing, you'll
    need to get hints into the font somehow (specifically, the 'fpgm', 'prep', and
    'cvt ' tables). I don't know whether FontCreator is capable of generating new
    hints (autohinting); you may need some other tool if not.\r\n"

  body: i'm all at sea here. i tried the fonts again with greyscale for all the available
    ranges 1 to 65000 or so... i'm sat in front of a very tiny/expensive mac which
    has just recovered from a lengthy fit after trying to install one of them. OpenTypeData
    missing was the only red cross... but the pre-VOLT .ttf version was OK... i think.
    my destiny lies elsewhere, evidently. but thanks for lifting the curtain on the
    hinting landscape, gaunt and strange though it is.

  body: "Hey Chris. If you got an older font program, like from 10 years ago, try
    and save the font you're having a problem with as a .pfa file. Then reopen it
    in the more recent program, copy from .pfa, paste in new font, and voila.\r\nHope
    this trick helped even though your post is a year old."
