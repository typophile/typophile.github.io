  ([[Visual Graphics Corporation]], makers of the Typositor)\r\n\r\nInclude only fonts
  created by VGC. DO NOT include those marketed by VGC, but originated by other foundries
  (such as ITC or ATF). (Unless, it is a special version--such as shaded--peculiar
  to VGC.)\r\n\r\n(VGC's most famous font, I'd say, has to be the original 1965 version
  of Friz Quadrata.)\r\n\r\nIf possible, I'd also like to know the designer and/or
  year of release."

    is part of Tim Ryan's Typeface NameBase project that he compiled during the early
    90s. I have only provided the typeface names here, but you grab a tab-delimited
    text file from my server which also includes the designer and year of release
    for each face. I cannot vouch for 100% accuracy, but it's the best I've got.\r\n\r\nI

  body: No one&#39;s mentioned Pistilli Roman, either. My suggestion is it&#39;s worth
    the effort to get your hands on actual VGC catalogs or promotion material, if
    you&#39;re aiming for a definitive list.

  body: Like I said before, I never promised a definitive listing. And I concur with
    Peter that obtaining a VGC catalog or two might shed a better light when trying
    to find the stragglers. However, I have several VGC books and no single one of
    them lists the typeface, release date and designer as comprehensively as the Typeface
    NameBase listing I provided. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m afraid that this stuff is scattered
    hither and yon.

  body: Very true, Grant. Plus, one catalog lists &#34;VGC Award Winning Alphabets&#34;,
    &#34;VGC Original Designer Alphabets&#34;, and &#34;VGC Original Alphabets&#34;.
    Unfortunately the distinction between exclusive-to-VGC and licensed-to-VGC typefaces
    is nowhere explained clearly in their material.

    the abbreviation &#34;VGC&#34; is usually used to mean &#34;very good condition&#34;.

  body: Your best bets are university or research libraries, and used booksellers,
    both online and in person. Look for &#34;Alphabet Library&#34; by Visual Graphics
    Corporation, or VGC Corp. Latest edition I&#39;ve seen is the 15th, copyright
    1990. Hope this helps.
