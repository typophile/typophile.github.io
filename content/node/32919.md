  appears to be more common in print, and the other in handwritten text (we learn
  it at school), but some fonts use the latter form.  Some fonts even use one form
  in regular style, but the other form in italic.\r\n\r\nMy question is simply, do
  these two different forms of the letter have names?  I'm sure they must, and I need
  to know for a report I'm writing, but Googling for anything where one of the key
  words is a single letter is nearly impossible.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/letter-a_5735.gif]"

  body: "The first terms that come to my mind are \"single-storey\" and \"double-storey\"
    and variants thereof. EDIT: ok, the order should of course be the reverse.\r\n\r\nSee
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16494\">this Typophile thread</a> for example;
    google for more uses of the terms."
