  body: 'I have had a couple of idea about this - one is that games are not type centered
    for the most part - they are explosion centered or something similar. So type
    takes a back seat. Another is that games are about instant gratification and type
    that supports a feeling/sensibility rather than the needs of legibility is going
    to win out. Yet another is that your complaint might be about any one or more
    of several possible type "problems" I have seen in games. So... I am not sure
    which one or more you might be referring to. In fact, I hesitated to even post
    at all because of the vague nature of your statement. So ... you tell me: What
    (specifically) is appalling? '

  body: There is also the issue that text in games tends to be bitmaps, rather than
    a 'live' font. Since games are often running at non-native resolutions, this means
    that the text is frequently distorted and blurry.

  body: "Most game designers are concerned with style, rather than legibility, as
    Eben said. They view type as a way to emphasize the setting or atmosphere of the
    game, and less as a data source. This is ironic, of course, as gamers depend on
    the HUD to give them instant-access information that is directly tied to their
    performance in the game world. Valve Software does a good job with <i>Half-Life
    2</i>, using DIN <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:800px-City17HL2.jpg\">throughout
    the HUDs</a> of the three chapters out so far, as well as a legible screen font
    for small type (not sure which, offhand. Probably Verdana.) They have a keen eye
    for graphic design along with an incredible game design sense. Kind of like Pixar
    in many ways.\r\n\r\nJohn's also hit another issue on the nose, particularly with
    PC games (vs console). The advent of HD has also lead some developers to typeset
    info that is completely illegible on SD TVs. So lame.\r\n\r\nIf I had the free
    time, I'd love to write a paper on HUD/interface design in games."

  body: "No kidding it's frequently distorted and blurrrry. \r\n\r\nThe games I've
    seen on my wife's DS, tend to have a lot of text. Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy
    both have involved story lines, all of which is conveyed in text. There is quite
    a bit of reading to do to get through games, and the text is  in crummy looking
    dot matrix fonts or worse. My sons' X-Box games are sometimes practically unreadable,
    with fonts that seem  to have been chosen with no thought as to how they'd render
    on screen. The graphics seem like they should support decently rendered legible
    typography.\r\n\r\nMy eyesight is not bad for my age, but my eyes do tend to get
    tired quickly if I have to struggle to read something because the type is NFG.
    I'll just put it aside. It occurred to me that perhaps one of the reasons I hate
    playing video and computer games is the lousy typography.  \r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    I think Oblivion did a pretty good job, with it's hundreds of in-game books. The
    letters could've been a bit less fuzzy, but overall, the text was pretty legible

  body: "I haven't found the text to be that bad in the recent games I've played,
    but the image that oprion posted is a large part of the reason of the current
    trends, I think.\r\n\r\nBasically, if a gamer thinks of a \"hard-core\" gaming
    text style, they'll thinking back to the video classics.  Once a lot of games
    moved from 8 bit to 16 bit and on, they kept a similar style.  Newer series couldn't
    break too much.\r\n\r\nRPGs of course have more text than most, and even though
    it's often bitmap, it's not that tiring.  Also age could play a factor.  Mario
    is designed to be played by a generally younger crowd (or at least enabled to
    be played by them) while Halo 3 is for older people who probably have HDTVs and
    sit right next to the screen and can use the itty bitty tiny text.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "Some games that I have seen recently, such as the latest Need for Speed offering
    (in Australia.. so it has possibly been succeeded by multiple new versions in
    the US...) actually have really great typefaces and type treatment in-game on
    the PC.\r\n\r\nI often think it must be pretty hard to configure type behaviour
    in games like World of Warcraft, where each player has their name bobbing above
    their heads, and the size of the type changes every millisecond depending on your
    perspective and distance from it as you run between and among up to hundreds of
    people. It never seems to look too hideous at all."

  body: "I'm impressed with the knowledge here about older (1990's and older) video
    games and their role in typography (Oh Zork, how I loved you.). Usually in today's
    day and age it seems to be overlooked by younger generations.\r\n\r\nOn to the
    topic, most electronic games tend to desire function over form when it comes to
    typography. As a few already have pointed out, letters on old or hand held systems
    were designed the way they were due to the pixel resolution's limitations. Though,
    I agree, wading through sentence after sentence of an old final fantasy game with
    text larger than my character can get slow and choppy.\r\n\r\nFor a while there
    games were concentrated on either PC or consoles, consoles had their resolution
    limitations (640x480, yuck!) while PC's could obtain much higher resolutions and
    provide better readability. Now a days game designers are focusing on the console
    crowd and higher resolutions as a second option and to focus on this is to work
    within limitations of screen and input options, resulting in poor typographic
    choices on a reading level (Oblivion and Deus Ex 2, I'm looking at you.). Thankfully
    this HD craze might help push game designers in a direction where all our eyes
    can be happy. Although I will argue that not being creative within constraints
    isn\u2019t an excuse for bad type.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem within game companies
    would be ignorance in typography. However, some execute this very well and as
    a system (as mentioned, Valve\u2019s Half-Life 2) while others do what is right
    in terms of context (console style type, Ion Storm\u2019s Deus Ex 1).\r\n\r\nI
    also think context is a big issue in game typography that's generally avoided
    (except in, maybe, the over used \"future\" and \"outer-space\" style typography).
    If you're going to place a game in a certain time period, the designer should
    take account of the appropriateness of the type choices on many different reading
    levels.\r\n\r\nI have to disagree with being used to the medium. I mean, I know
    exactly what you mean in terms of game play and how to use a game, but no one
    should get used to bad type.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think this is a good point,
    perhaps there needs to be better graphic design practices in game design.\r\n"

  body: "As a side note to the above thoughts, how Typography takes a backseat:\r\n\r\nI
    have lost count of the amount of hours I've spent playing Final Fantasy games,
    and even now... in trying to visualize the type they utilized it just doesn't
    come to mind. (Strangely though I can see the X in Final Fantasy 8 very well and
    it's bitmappy as hell).\r\n\r\nI think it goes without saying that, type takes
    a very, very, very far back seat. You have to remember that people will first
    be looking at the graphics. Something else important to remember is that type
    takes its most prevalent forms in two ways in video games:\r\n\r\nDialogue and
    Menus.\r\n\r\nWhile you can make the argument that people will or will not notice
    the type in dialogues, Menu surfing, I've found, becomes systematic. If I'm pausing
    to restore a character's heath, or to switch out a weapon I do it so quickly because
    I want to get back to the action! I think eventually, the menus become physical
    interface to our functional desires as opposed to these self-guiding mechanisms
    where we need to read the type. Every. Single. Time.\r\n\r\nIt's just how it goes. "
