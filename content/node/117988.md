  trying to identify the font used in the word \"Russian\" and also the font used
  in the tagline \"The Trip of a Lifetime\". \r\n\r\nI have a client that is looking
  to create a print ad but the only assets we possess are low-res, digital images
  that are parts of branded headers. Luckily, the same fonts are used for both of
  the companies, so if I can identify one, I can recreate the other."
