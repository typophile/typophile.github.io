body: Hello everyone. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to add a component, in Font Lab 4.6,
  to every glyph in my font. I tried the Generate Glyphs command, but it ended up
  renaming every glyph... which I don&#39;t really need to have happen. I tried to
  figure out how to program a macro but I can&#39;t seem to wrap my brain around Python.
  I checked out the FontLab/Mapping folder and my computer kept crashing. Hitting
  Opt-F9 every single time is very exciting, but I have to do this to 15 more fonts
  and I&#39;d like to have some time to eat this week. <BR> <BR>If any one has any
  clues or hints to share I&#39;d appreciate it.  <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Clueless Newbie.

  body: Thanks for the tip, Adam, I appreciate it. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, anchors
    would only complicate my problem, and I can&#39;t seem to get to the alias.dat
    file. <BR> <BR>I wish the MSN groups were searchable... I should write someone
    an email about their interface. <BR> <BR>Thanks again, <BR>D

  body: 'Dyanna - <BR>As an alternate, you can crack open one of your old FOG  <BR>generated
    PS T1 files and use the components. Sounds strange, <BR>but try this: <BR> <BR>1.&#41;
    Open the old font in FL and also have open <BR>your new font &#40;without the
    accents&#41; but with proper accents <BR>in their slots - acute, diereses etc.
    <BR>2.&#41; Select the accented characters in the old font <BR>and paste them
    into the new font. <BR>3.&#41; Magically, if all goes well, your new font will
    sub <BR>the accents and proper letters into these slots. <BR>Instant accented
    characters. <BR> <BR>Disclaimer - I figured this one out by accident and <BR>pure
    desperation. It requires your old font to <BR>have all of the components present.
    Old FOG files <BR>will often decompose the accented cap characters <BR>once opened
    in FL. You can of course manually insert <BR>each component via Glyph &#62; Add
    component. <BR> <BR>You can then apply this to your other 15 fonts <BR>once you&#39;ve
    got a decent file working. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps.'

  body: Thanks, Eric for your help. <BR> <BR>Although, I&#39;m not dealing with accented
    characters - I&#39;m trying to paste one component into every glyph - from the
    thorn to the fi ligatures. So that if I need to modify it later I won&#39;t have
    to go back and copy, paste, copy, paste... <BR> <BR>However you brought up an
    excellent point, and that is, to use an old program. RoboFog should give me no
    trouble. In time, hopefully, I&#39;ll figure out the macro. <BR> <BR>Thanks again,
    both of you, for your help. <BR> <BR>Dyana
