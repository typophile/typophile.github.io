		<div class="commentbody">trying to find bibles to look it does seem to be my problem John - I've been going round the city sneaking into churches (some still have open doors) but all I get are Psalms &amp; proverb books. Searching online isin't very helpful in trying to get a sense of the faces - well unless I'm going to order them and wait 2 weeks.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I manage to find a copy of the New Testament but its produced by the Canadian Gideons for 1986. Not very bible-y looking. Which is why I'm asking here, hoping a survey of  ideas , venues and titles might solve the quintecential bible &quot;look&quot; from worldly typophiles. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Weidemann sounds familiar - thanks. I guess that is what I'm looking for - I had thought that there were a slew of fonts that must have been created specifically for typesetting bibles.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Micheal: the book is a complete listing and viewing of the winners from our areas Advertising and Design Association awards, So cover is important (but I got that done) its black, vertical and horizontal lines reading Advertising and Design&hellip;.crossed with 2003 Awards&quot; layed out tiny tiny in the upper right hand corner in white. The book will be perfect bound - the cover resembling leather (but fake, no budget here) the inside pages to be 2 columns I'm thinking with that vertical rule in the gutter. the Left side page on spreads will have an image of the piece - the right side text - 1 major dropcap, first line indents on paras. At least this is what I can drum up so far.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't think I want medieval - just classic enough. Its going on superwhite Mead silk paper - so I'm not going to fake a traditional bible that technically should be on yellowing pages.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm searching out those bibles you mentioned - thanks John. Hopefully I can find text pages in google</div>

The word of god means labor and work, you are small - what you read is great. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can read only part by part, lots of numbers separate the text. And passages that should impress you most are printed in bold. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A whole different approach is Caflischs bible: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Take it and read, without sacred respect. So I can experience itself: the powerful prosa of creation or Job, the music of the psalms, the criminal stories in the old testament, the difficult letters of st.paul, the stories of the gospels. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All that is literature - very good literature. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By this layout I can view myself - apart from my education and the advice of others. The text is readable as a novel - without disturbing numbers and links. Those are set in the margin. And no headlines and bold sentences tear the language apart (and don't disturb the rhythm of speech.) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This way layout serves the word. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Is aping the design of Bibles blasphemous? I think one would need to ask a qualified religious authority, not an art director. Personally, I think it likely depends on the content for which you are designing: if you were producing a catalogue for hardcore porn videos, then I think it would be blasphemous in that it deliberately associates the imagery of sacred text with the scandalous and profane. Of course, the content of an awards book is still technically profane, but it probably isn't scandalous. Note that I'm using scandalous in its theological sense, i.e. something that encourages sin in others or knowingly creates the opportunity for sin.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with John (as I do with his position in the war/peace-thread - very good and important)  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a theologian and pastor I'm (normally) very aware of blasphemian content (and there is a lot of hidden blasphemy in ads, and a lot of things I don't agree with and don't like, as there is blasphemy in political, economical positions and sometimes even in positions of churches as history shows). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I have had any suspicion of blasphemy I wouldn't have contributed anything here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I see it as harmless aping. Maybe even - if it's well designed - it recalls a sense for biblical word as a good side effect. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the bible itself you can find lists of people, families, soldiers, even lists of payment (and lists of sin and sinners ;-)   ) and so on, because the bible (in the old testament) keeps track and memory of people - a sign of care. In this sense I can agree with the bible design - some sign of difference, ironical modification provided. And the last points I think can be seen in thee outter form and the context in which the book appears. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand: The use of the cross on the cover could - if I think twice - bother me a little. Could it be that religious importance is applied to design and advertising ?* I for example don't like books named as &quot;bible&quot; if they aren't - excepted if it's clearly ironic - for example I dislike &quot;The Macintosh Bible&quot;, &quot;The Windows Bible&quot; and so on, because the content is not worthy of such high word as &quot;bible&quot; and computers shouldnt get that respect.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For me that spot of bothering would immediately disappear, if the text on the cover wouldn't form a cross. With black/white, the position and so on there is enough reference to the bible-look to keep that concept. And there is no problem for me in the design of the inside pages. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Perhaps I should say it this way: It is a problem of the direction of sense/meaning. The aping of religious design isn't blasphemic and I don't have any problem/bothering with it (except of sometimes  tasteless things you can see). Religion itself and its design should have enough power to stand that and there is no need to be strict. Sometimes even it is good and prophetic to ape forms - for rethinking and changing them. (a sideway thought of me: that black design of bibles for example with the strict white line-cross does'nt show the liveliness of the word inside, see for better the rich and joyful design of old bible manuscripts) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But if - in the other direction - profane things are raised to religious importance that's indeed problematic. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think the same rules apply to the bible and the qu'ran or talmud. Because since we realised the separation between church and state, we gained the right to make fun, to ridiculize, to do the worse blasphemy things upon christiannity. It isn't the same at all about Judaism, or Islam, and i don't think comparing them in the idea to consider and treat them in the same way makes sense. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And blasphemy is only such if the person who do it is religious.
