  what it was.\r\n\r\nIt features (among many other things) info on the type designed
  by Norm (Manuel Krebs and Dimitri Bruni) for the airport in ?Berlin? i think.. typeface
  called simple? My mind may be failing me.\r\n\r\nThe site was really modular in
  that the navigation could be dragged around the screen.\r\n\r\nAnyone?\r\n\r\nThanks."
