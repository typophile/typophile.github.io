body: "I'm making an alphabet book for my son.  He attends Montessori school, where
  they introduce the alphabet using lowercase, cursive letters.  I'm looking for a
  typeface that is reminiscent of the lettering that used to be in the cursive workbooks
  I used as a kid.\r\n\r\nHere is a good example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DK_6154.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  \"practice strokes\" that start letters such as a, o, and q are important.  My son's
  school will use lettering that has those strokes.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nNick\r\n\r\nP.S.
  I plan to self-publish the book, too, so I can't use typefaces with personal-use-only
  licenses.  Thanks again."

    A typeface I've made based on the actual typeface used in many of the material
    that they use within the Montessori schools. A link for a mac-version could be
    found here;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com/free.html\r\n\r\nContact me if you

    think I'm going to use FS Contemporary from Educational Fontware.  Despite Educational
    Fontware's less-than-ideal ligature situation (http://www.educationalfontware.com/FAQs.html
    ... scroll down to \"How do you get the cursive to link?\"), the glyphs are exactly
    what I need.\r\n\r\nThanks again."
