body: 'okay so i&#39;m kinda excited to post this one, hopefully it won&#39;t flop
  too hard. anyhow, this is my first sincere attempt to develop one of my own original
  ideas for a face. this one was actually inspired, in part, by a thread here on typophile
  &#40;<a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/43155.html" target="_blank">Display
  vs. Text</a>&#41;. <BR>it got me thinking about reading speed and what my own thoughts
  were on the ideal font for reading quickly. i based the design on my own hare-brained
  thoughts on the subject, no research of any kind was performed, so thankfully no
  literate people were injured in the creation of this font. anyhow for me the ideal
  for speed would be an italic, as the slant supposedly keeps the eye moving forward.
  however the decorative nature of the italic hampers speed in reading, or so they
  say. i hate the sloped roman breed with a passion, so i tried to come up with something
  inbetween a sloped roman and a true italic. i&#39;ll let you judge on whether or
  not i succeeded. <BR>besides the slant, i thought that a serif structure that moved
  from top to bottom and left to right would also keep the eye moving forward. and
  i dreamt up this serif structure so that the letters in a word would interlock &#40;hence
  the working name&#41;. <BR>anyhow, that&#39;s probably more than you really wanted
  to know, so i&#39;ll spare you the rest and let you go ahead and look at it. i&#39;m
  rather happy with the results thus far, but i&#39;m sure i have plenty to improve
  upon. help me find those areas. thnx for looking! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/50588.gif"

  body: I don&#39;t know about reading speed, but it sure does convey the concept
    of velocity. Very intriguing! <BR> <BR>The s looks a bit too slanted. I don&#39;t
    know... Some combinations like a&#43;u or e&#43;w sort of look like one letter
    is about to collapse over the other, don&#39;t you think? Maybe fine-tuning the
    slants a bit would help.

  body: Paul, the way you have used the usual &#39;u&#39; serifs on the vwy is inspired.
    I agree with Meir that it needs work to balance and knit it together, but it&#39;s
    very promising.

  body: 'Now this is interesting. Bravo, Paul. <BR> <BR>Although some of the mechanics
    of reading you&#39;re assuming aren&#39;t based on any actual findings &#40;as
    you readily admit&#41;, much of what you&#39;ve arrived at speaks very dearly
    to my heart, and mind. If you search for &#34;Harrier&#34; in my Daidala interview&#42;
    you might see some interesting parallels. Your stuff is a lot less rigid, and
    has some traditional overtones - makes me think of the first half of the 20th
    century, like Gill. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.daidala.com/25apr2004.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.daidala.com/25apr2004.html</a> <BR> <BR>Basically,
    this is <i>exactly</i> the type of work I very much hope catches on in the world
    of type design - it makes me happy to see you go in this direction. <BR> <BR>Some
    specifics: <BR>- If this is a book face, I&#39;d make it slightly darker, and
    I&#39;d pull in the descenders a bit. <BR>- Tighten the spacing significantly
    - apply the concept in the name!&#42; <BR>- The bottom of the &#34;t&#34; is malformed.
    <BR>- The &#34;c&#34; is nothing short of charming. <BR>- The ear of the &#34;q&#34;
    looks spliced in. <BR>- To me the &#34;a&#34; is too self-conscious. <BR>- The
    &#34;w&#34; is very nice. <BR>- I&#39;m surprises that I like the &#34;f&#34;.
    But do make it wider. <BR>- The &#34;d&#34; seems somewhat constructed. But I
    think you should keep it. <BR>- The &#34;y&#34; needs more size, and a stronger
    tail. <BR>- I think the &#34;r&#34; is very good. Maybe a stronger beak. <BR>-
    The &#34;s&#34; is indeed leaning too much, but its narrowness is superb. BTW,
    try making the &#34;e&#34; narrower. <BR>- I&#39;m unsure about the tail of the
    &#34;j&#34;. <BR>- The &#34;g&#34; is amazingly good! I&#39;d make the ear stronger,
    and expand the bottom bowl more to the right. <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, &#34;Interloc&#34;
    &#40;&#34;Interlocq&#34;?&#41; is interesting - I&#39;m assuming it derives from
    the semi-serifs interlocking. <BR> <BR>Paul, please take this all the way. But
    be prepared for many people to not understand. <BR> <BR>I dare say I think you&#39;ve
    got what it takes to make a mark - which means you should plan some contingencies
    for a life of poverty and obscurity.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: I knew this reminded me of something. Harrier is also very promising, and
    already more polished - when are you going to finish it Hrant?  <BR> <BR>While
    there is a similarity in concept, your way of handling it, Paul, is quite different.
    I think they both promise to be excellent additions. I wonder what an upright
    version of yours, Paul would look like also, with the flying serifs on the vwy.

  body: 'Thanks William. Anybody who wants to buy a pre-release version of Harrier
    can contact me; that&#39;s actually how Paul himself got a hold of Patria for
    his newspaper. <BR> <BR>An upright version of Interloc would indeed be interesting
    - the problem is the serifs: putting half-serifs on totally upright strokes makes
    the font lean backwards. You can see this problem clearly in some of H E Meier&#39;s
    work. In Avance Bloemsma solves it by putting flares on the opposite sides -which
    however gives a certain feminine/calligraphic skew- although that might actually
    work great &#40;better than Avance, and certainly better than Harrier would&#41;
    in Interloc. The other obvious avenue is leaving a very slight slant &#40;maybe
    1 degree&#41; in there - but that causes problems in lo-res rendering. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    unconciously as i&#39;m sure i&#39;ve read that interview before. and i think
    this has a bit of patria in it&#39;s blood &#40;and hopefully a bit of palatino
    and goudy&#41; <BR> <BR>no plans to do an upright version as i feel that that
    would subvert the whole theory of this face. however this one is on a 5 degree
    slant, i thought i&#39;d try 3 and 2 degrees as well once i finish up all the
    characters. <BR> <BR>i do plan on doing a full italic version, though. i&#39;ll
    keep the same slant but ad a caligraphic flair. this will solve the problem of
    an italic breaking the flow of the text &#40;in theory&#41;. <BR> <BR>thanks for
    the help with the characther&#39;s i&#39;ve got thus far. i put interlocq in the

  body: '&#62; 2 degrees <BR> <BR>Note that there&#39;s a range where the slant is
    neither here nor there - between [consciously] visible and not. This is a &#34;dangerous&#34;
    range - although I guess it might be possible to use this ambivalence to good
    effect, somehow. <BR> <BR>&#62; Running Text <BR> <BR>Although I think that would
    be too literal, I like the basic idea. That&#39;s where the name &#34;Harrier&#34;
    comes from, btw: the hunting dog breed - running purposefully and tirelessly,
    with the flag on its tail held high for good visibility!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;
    what exactly do you mean by the a being too self-conscious?  <BR> <BR>You know,
    looking at it again I think it&#39;s fine - just maybe make the middle join stay
    straight, not turn slightly up. <BR> <BR>BTW, check out the &#34;a&#34; in Octavian...

  body: '&#62;there&#39;s a range where the slant is neither here nor there  <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t really agree with this. Syntax has a 1/2 degree slant and you
    can still &#39;feel&#39; it even though you don&#39;t identify the source of the
    dynamism. The eye is extremely sensitive to verticals, and the slightest variation,
    I think.   <BR> <BR>I suspect that if this is too slanted it will never be used
    much for text, only display. The slant now is a bit dizzying, but this might have
    other causes, I don&#39;t know.  <BR> <BR>Note that Jenson is slanted on one side
    &#40;bottom left, top right&#41;, so that some slant can work well for text. The
    assymetrical serifs of Jenson could work for an upright version. Check out also
    <a href="http://www.teff.nl/fonts/trinite/trinite.html" target="_blank">Trinite</a>,
    a fabulous piece of work with some slant and assymetrical serifs.'

  body: wow! thnx william. i guess i hadn&#39;t taken that close a look at trinite
    before. i think i like the subtle slant more than what i&#39;ve currently got.
    i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll tone it down a bit, i don&#39;t want it to be a distraction,
    that&#39;d defeat the whole purpose of my idea here. thanks for pointing that
    out.

  body: 'William, that&#39;s sort of what I meant. Half a degree is well below the
    zone I&#39;m talking about, so it&#39;s &#34;seen&#34; &#40;by virtually everybody&#41;
    in the heart and not the mind. Above a certain degree &#40;maybe around 2&#41;
    it&#39;s the other way around. It&#39;s the range between those where the slant
    might flip-flop between visible and subvisible &#40;even within one individual,
    certainly between different people&#41;, and I think that might be disconcerting,
    or at least unpredictable. <BR> <BR>Also note that the visibility of slant &#40;just
    like anything else&#41; is greatly determined by scale: the larger the size the
    more &#34;conscious&#34; it gets. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    now and am almost ready to show a re-worked version, which hopefully is a bit
    more refined. <a href=\"http://photos21.flickr.com/34220385_20edde0957_o.gif\">here's
    a sneak peek</a>\r\n\r\nin keeping with the speedreading theme, i'm thinking i
    just may make a fully upright version and designate it as the italic. my thinking
    being that the full uprights impede speed, slowing down for items of emphasis.
    i just need to draw up the x and maybe a few bits of punctuation and then i'll
    see about figgering how to make a pdf accesible to look at a text setting.\r\n\r\nanyhow,
    thanks for looking!"

    a needs some kind of beak like the c and r and like your old version. The current
    Optima-like terminal I think is a bit light. Zapf himself gave the a in Optima
    a beak in the new Optima Nova! The top right of the e seems heavy. The k is awkward. '

    is moping.\r\n5) The \"k\" I actually find admirable.\r\n6) I might do something
    about the serifs of the \"m\".\r\n7) \"r\": stronger beak. But no wider.\r\n8)
    \"s\": maybe more zing too.\r\n9) \"t\": higher head.\r\n10) Maybe give a twist
    to the middle part of the \"w\".\r\n11) The \"z\" is totally out of character.
    It's not even leaning!\r\n\r\nAn upright for emphasis: this is not a bad idea,
    and I've actually seen it applied (although at the typesetting level, not the
    font level). The most accessible example is the English inserts of tipoGrafica.
    But a word of caution: in a body of italic, upright settings actually look slightly
    backslanted - very disconcerting. So your upright should actually have a slight
    slant, maybe 1 degree. Oh, and I'd keep the semi serifs!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
