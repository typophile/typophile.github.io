  body: "BLOSSOM is Rotis Semi Serif (probably bold) mixed with Serif (M) and perhaps
    customized (S)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/agfa-rotis-semi-serif/\r\n\r\nMadeira's
    Handmade Chocolates could be Meta Medium or Bold, but that's a rough scan."

    body: "Hi Patricia!\r\nThank's but isn\xB4t Rotis. The 'M' have serif. It's my
      first thought to, but don't match. I try the T'26 Pilgrim and FF Avance but
      without success to."

  body: Hmm.  You're right. Maybe they just customized something else.

  body: "I think <strong>BLOSSOM</strong> is clearly customized from Times or one
    of its descendants - I'm guessing <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0003347\">Times
    Ten</a>.\r\n\r\nI agree with the suggestion of Meta for the small type but it's
    such a fuzzy scan that it's hard to be certain."

  body: "Thank's Andrew!\r\nBut I don\xB4t think is Times Ten. The \xB4B`is different
    in the lower curve and the \xB4S\xB4serif are in 90\xBA, not like Times. To many
    diffences. I suspect is\xB4nt a customized font."

    body: "Hmm - you may be right. The S and the M are so intuitively connected with
      Times, though, that I feel it must have been the source.\r\n\r\nDo you have
      a sharper version? That might help."
