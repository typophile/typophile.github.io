  of my redesign of the paper. Please critique it and inform me of any flaws so I
  can improve.\r\n\r\nI particularly want feedback about these areas of my design:\r\n\r\ntext
  font: I used a sans serif text font, but most newspapers use a serif font. Is my
  break from tradition okay? My goal in using the sans serif text is to make the paper
  look more modern to attract the high school audience.\r\n\r\nnameplate: For a special
  effect, I used an idea from Apple Mac OS X Leopard's Dock by reflecting the nameplate.
  Will this effect be a problem when printed on paper? Also, I am concerned with text
  boldness.\r\n\r\nuse of blacks: Most newspapers use grays instead of blacks for
  contrast, but I used white text on a black background for even more contrast. Is
  this a good idea?\r\n\r\nThank you for your comments on my design."

  body: "First off the bat, you've stretched the text for the Newspaper's name (Copperplate
    Gothic?) by 227%, which looks obvious and doesn't look great IMO.  I think it's
    best to find a font that fits the space better, with any stretching of the font
    kept to a minimum.  You applied stretching to other areas too, so I'd say try
    and apply the same discipline by finding a condensed font that fits better.\r\n\r\nUsing
    a serif font for body text won't necessarily make the newspaper look old fashioned.
    \ There are some really forward looking serif fonts out there that'll make it
    look great.  Sans Serif fonts are harder to read for lengthy passages, although
    this being a two page newsletter, I don't think that'll be an issue in this case.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps, and please post subsequent versions when you've taken enough advice
    on board - I'd like to see it develop.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "my 2 cents\r\n\r\nI think you got a bit carried away with the different fonts
    you used\r\n(count about 18 including the weights). I would decide on 2-3 font
    families\r\nand stick with them...\r\n\r\na few points:\r\n- listen to jazzhustler
    (try some serifs...you will be surprised)\r\n- dont use the reflection on the
    top\r\n(works for apple i know...but it doesnt suite your newspaper)\r\n- try
    the boxes and dividers without the double lines\r\n- the captions and some of
    the titles have to much space between the letters\r\n(makes it hard to read)\r\n-
    check the dots on the \"inside box\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/02/11/award-winning-newspaper-designs/\r\nfor
    your inspiration\r\n\r\nhope this helps...keep us posted\r\n\r\nPS: tried to download
    an older version of the newspaper (baronbanner.com)\r\nbut the download was 40mb...wow...a
    bit too big...smile"

  body: "I was the high school newspaper editor in high school, and got to design
    the layout too -- that's how I got into graphic design. I wanted to be a journalist
    before that.\r\n\r\nI would agree with all the comments above. Part of the issue,
    as I remember it, was the fact that the paper's budget is a few thousand dollars,
    so you're limited to some not so great fonts and some not so new software. Definitely
    choose a couple fonts, like a serif font for copy and a sans serif for headlines,
    and simplify the boxes for callout info -- a simple thin dividing line would look
    much cleaner than a black box.\r\n\r\nI would say you should speak with your other
    editors and your adviser about what the goal of the paper for the year is. Do
    you want to win awards and send your senior editors off to journalism school on
    scholarships? Or do you want to be something that connects with the students at
    your school and is fun for the newspaper staff? A lot of people are going to say
    \"that's not mutually exclusive,\" but in my experience they were. \r\n\r\nI went
    with the latter my senior year -- it had a zine-like feel, different fonts on
    every page, everyone got to design their own story, and it looked like crap for
    the most part. I tried--briefly--to get everyone using a clean design with the
    same fonts and the same grid, and we were going to be a professional paper with
    serious stories that got me a journalism scholarship, goddamnit. But I quickly
    realized that the newspaper ended up in the trash, and nobody had any fun making
    it. So there were stories about fashion trends for girls, stories about what's
    hot and what's not, why TOLO is going to be great and super-fun for everyone,
    what the sports editor's favorite Christian metal bands are, and I could write
    about serious stuff if I wanted to. The result was that people on the staff really
    cared about their stories -- it was their baby, and they got to take it beginning
    to end, rather than handing it over to someone else to design. And there was something
    for everyone, so people were actually excited when the paper came out.\r\n\r\nSo
    that was my experience: I got to be editor as the paper was rebuilding, and the
    program was pretty weak, so I found it more important to have it connect with
    the student body and be a good experience for the staff. But part of me wished
    I had gone to a high school with a really strong newspaper program and I could
    have worked on something that won awards and got me a scholarship. The high school
    where I lived had a program where you could take community college courses for
    both college and high school credit for free, so I did that for all my other classes
    aside from journalism. I took graphic design courses at my community college,
    and that was my outlet for design I was proud of. Again, just make sure all the
    editors are on the same page -- do you want to be Harper's or USA Today?"

    a full redesign this year; I know what you are going through. Congratulations
    on a great start! You do have a great start, and listening to these experts giving
    you advice will only make it better.\r\n\r\nSome of the advice you are getting
    might be a little depressing, but don't lose heart. It's good advice, and it will
    make your paper look much better. Limit the number of fonts you use, and don't
    squish or stretch them. On our paper, we ended up with two font families; both
    have lots of faces available for variety. Be consistent on your headlines. Don't
    go rule-crazy; it's a common mistake on student papers!\r\n\r\nNo one answered
    your question about the white-on-black. It's not bad, and it does provide a huge
    amount of contrast. Just so you know the other side, the argument would be that
    it is a bit stark and harsh. Newspapers often use grays to \"soften the blow,\"
    so to speak. You might think about having the most important box (maybe the header)
    black but make the less important boxes gray; that would soften the page and also
    give the reader a clue about the hierarchy of what's important. Also be aware
    that it can make the page off-balance: from a distance, \"squint\" at a page and
    see how balanced it looks.\r\n\r\nHere are a few resources you might find helpful:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.newsdesigner.com/blog/|NewsDesigner.com]]\r\n[[http://www.newspagedesigner.com|News

    hiatus as they change editors, but the archives is still an excellent resource

    News Design Associates]]\r\n[[http://www.brasstacksdesign.com/index.html|Articles

    but I think they still have some helpful information.\r\n"

  body: "Also check your first-line indentation.\r\n\r\nYou've decided to indent the
    first paragraph in each article, but not the rest of the paragraphs. This makes
    it look a bit like the entire article is one big block of text. Now, think about
    what is the use of indenting the first line in a new paragraph: letting the reader
    know that there's a new block of text. Therefore, it makes more sense that you
    use this convention to help your readers take in all this text without it looking
    like one huge paragraph. The first paragraph of each article, on the other hand,
    can do without the first-line indentation. So, basically, you had a good idea
    using different indentation rules depending on the kind of paragraph (first or
    otherwise), and all you need to do is invert those rules, to make them useful
    to your readers.\r\n\r\nFollowing this same advice, I'd look into making that
    first-line indentation a bit more subtle. Remember that style shouldn't hinder
    readability. Such a big indentation can be quite distracting. Think that this
    convention, or rule, you're creating should help mark a new paragraph without
    shouting about it. A good rule of thumb may be to set the first-line indentation
    to the same points as the text (if text is at 12pts, then first-line indentation
    should be set at 12pts). This is in no way a law, but a good guideline to begin.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

  body: "Hi dchan.  I think it's a major improvement overall.  I personally still
    have an issue with the Banner text being stretched, as it's still over 150%, which
    to me is a lot, and it looks it (IMO).  I opened the file up in Illustrator and
    adjusted the text to just 110%, then increased the overall size to fit the available
    space then move everything above the body text upto the banner up a little (can't
    seem to upload an image to demonstrate this at the moment).  Shame you've gotten
    rid of the icon on the previous version, but then it could have made it look a
    tad old fashioned I suppose, and if you're trying to appeal to students, that
    has to be considered.\r\n\r\nOn a Grammar point, the center spread headline should
    be 'The Dos & Don'ts of High School'.\r\n\r\nJH\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for sharing this project for critique. Redesigning your high school
    paper is an ambitious project. I have to echo many of the comments above. To reiterate:\r\n\r\n1.
    Don't stretch type. The reason behind this is that special consideration is placed
    how each character looks when designing a typeface. When a typeface is stretched,
    the stroke thickness can be drastically altered. The typeface in the mastehead
    was clearly stretched vertically and as a result the horizontal strokes are out
    of balance... not to mention other aspects of the typeface's design that have
    been distorted as a result.\r\n\r\n2. Consider a serif typeface for the body copy.
    As someone stated above there are serif typefaces that offer a more contemporary.
    On a side (but related note) be careful about your use of the word \"Modern\"
    in the context to art and design, Modern refers to a specific period in design.
    \"Contempory\" is the word with meaning you wish to express.\r\n\r\n3. Consider
    an italics face for your callouts\r\n\r\n4. The dot leadin in your \"Inside\"
    section overlaps your text\r\n\r\n5. Too much hyphenation in your \"Take Note\"
    section\r\n\r\n6. Too many fonts used... simplify the number of typeface you use
    in the design to two or three. One for the headlines, one for the body copy, and
    perhaps on more as needed for another specific use in the newspaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\nMichael
