  body: I&#39;ve had a client, last year, for whom I was designing a coffee bag. I
    was using Parkinson from Font Bureau. That typeface has a very unique capital
    R. This capital R caused debate in between myself and the client. They won, and
    the R became boring.  <BR> <BR>The R looks as those it was futzed with, IMHO,
    as does the G. But, the S doesn&#39;t match either.

    Bold</a>! Phew, that was confusing. Sorry for the wrong ID, but it did look a
    lot like Helvetica Ultra Compressed at first glance <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Now I see a lot of the other glyphs are off as
    well.. I promise to look twice next time. <BR> <BR>Tiff, I&#39;m with you on the
    R, it does look out of place in that sample.
