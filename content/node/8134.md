  body: I&#39;m not aware of any other digitizations of Bradley. If, however, <BR>you
    simply require something close, a similar old typeface <BR>called Germania was
    digitized by Dieter Steffmann as <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/g/germania.htm"
    target="_blank"> Germania</a> <BR>and by Jim Fordyce as <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/font.php?file=deutsch_gothic"
    target="_blank"> Deutsch Gothic</a>.
