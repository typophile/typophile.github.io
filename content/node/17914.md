body: "For the first time in my career, I have to design a fashion catalog in 4 different
  languages : English, French, Chinese and Russian. I have no problem setting type
  in French and English (since Montr\xE9al is bilingual), but I'm a little confused
  with the last two languages.\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nThe copywriters will send
  me the final texts in a couple days. So far, I have no idea what its going to look
  like.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't know anything about setting type in Chinese
  and Russian. Should I use Cyrillic characters for Russian ? Are there a lot of typefaces
  available in Roman/Russian/Chinese ?\r\n\r\nHow should I set the punctuation in
  Russian ? Same as in English ? Do they even have punctuation in Chinese ?\r\n\r\nAnybody
  has a good resource website for this issue ?\r\n\r\nSo many questions ! Any advice
  will be much appreciated ! "

    required Chinese typesetting, I found that local Chinese-language newspapers were
    an excellent (and reasonably priced) resource. Montr\xE9al is bound to have at
    least one such paper."

    quotes like this: \xAB\xBB.\r\n"

  body: There are of course some Open Type fonts with Cyrillic glyphs, so you could
    set at least the English, French and Russian with the same font. Hopefully you
    can get a native speaker to proof read the finished lay out.
