    contacted MyFonts and the designer and there's a long backstory to this, involving
    a '70s typeface that was new to me called Signa. Patrick claims Sassoon and TheSans
    had no influence on his work, which I find remarkable. Was going to write a Typographica
    piece if I get some time."

    on his work, which I find remarkable\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nRemarkable?  I would say
    unbelievable. I think its really obvious that the designer merged the two designs\u2014and
    the result?\u2014 it looks unabashedly like two merged designs\u2014 nothing else.
    Normally I don\u2019t have too much of a problem  with that (well, if its ugly
    that\u2019s another story) unless the designer cites his inspiration(s). As Lisa
    Lampanelli would say, \u201CYour fronting and I don\u2019t appreciate\u201D.\r\n\r\nXavier
    Dupre comes to mind. He wanted to try Officina and Unit he did so\u2014Vista and
    Sanuk. He wanted give a go with Triplex\u2014 Megano. At least he said so. I respect
    that because he respected his audience/customers by telling us.\r\n\r\nPost when
    you complete that article on typographica and thank you for the links too\r\n\r\nMikey

    man. Shall we call that \"borderline believable\"?\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I always
    find it funny when font specimens boldly show off the letter combinations that
    <em>don't</em> work. What's up with that \"nsi\" sequence in \"sensibilities\"
    in the <a href=\"http://origin.myfonts.com/s/aw/720x360/53/0/27379.png\">first
    Informa image</a>?"
