body: "What are the best setups of opentype classes for working with diacritics and
  other modified letters?\r\n\r\nMy font has stylistic alternates and small caps.
  I'm hoping for advice both on how to structure classes, and efficient ways to set
  them up.\r\n\r\nDo you have a giant @diacritics class with all of those letters
  in a long list? (and a @diacriticals.smcp class to go with it)? Do you organize
  by key letter (@adiacritics, e.g.) and then list all those in the smcp code? Or
  can you have a class of classes?\r\n\r\nAre there shortcuts for generating any of
  these classes?"

    the font window to Textedit, saved it to a text file, used this command:\r\n\r\ntr
    '/' '\\n' < ./bmonday_encode.txt > ./bmonday2.txt \r\n\r\nto insert real line
    breaks, and this one:\r\n\r\nsed -e s/$/.alt1/g bmonday_formatted.txt\r\n\r\nto
    create my big alternate classes. This allowed me to deal with the classes in Textedit
    where I can use 14-point Verdana to spot any mistakes before I work them into
    Fontlab.\r\n\r\nAnd remember, save your OpenType classes any time you edit them
    in Fontlab. You <em>will</em> accidentally use the evil class sorting button that
    deletes them at some point, so be ready."

  body: "If you're talking about classes for layout features and not kerning (well,
    kerning is a layout feature, but you know what I mean), then a lot of it comes
    down to what makes the most sense for you as a font editor.\r\n\r\nThere is sense
    in setting up a big lowercase class, @LC = [a b c d ...], and having a matching
    small caps class, @SC = [a.sc b.sc c.sc d.sc ...]. Such classes could include
    all the accented characters. These classes could be fairly easy to manage with
    a visual editor like FontLab.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to some contextual substitutions,
    you might want a class of \"all letters\" for some particular contextual rule,
    so you could then make a \"class of classes\": @LETTERS = [@LC @UC @SC].\r\n\r\nIf
    you're using a text editor and a features file, you might eventually find, as
    I did, that editing large classes like this can be difficult. Complementary classes
    have to match 1-to-1, and if there's an error, you'll find yourself poring over
    long class definitions trying to find the error.\r\n\r\nIn practice, you can specify
    basic letter ranges in shorthand, e.g. [a-z], so this can help. But I've found
    in some cases that it's helpful to see a list of single substitutions, e.g.\r\n\r\nsub
    dollar by dollar.oldstyle;\r\nsub cent by cent.oldstyle;\r\n\r\nand so on. It's
    tempting to start by putting everything in classes, but it's not always the best
    solution."

  body: "I suspect a lot depends on what font editing program you have.\r\n\r\nI too
    use a text editor, but one that has numerous capabilities, such as a column mode,
    sorting, change to case, etc. I use Vedit, but it is out of date. EditPad Pro
    would be much better.\r\n\r\nI can describe a couple things that I do, but this
    should be taken only a suggestion of how to think about things, not a recipe.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    I write off an .afm file. It will have all the characters. On a PC, you can them
    use grep to search for all instance of, say, \".sc\" in the afm file, and pipe
    them to another file. Working in that file, the columnar mode will quickly let
    you erase everything but the character names. Search & replace the returns with
    a space, and you now have a row. Copy the row, and search & delete the .sc (or
    .scmp or whatever). You now have a second row with the same order as the first.
    Copy that row, and apply a lower case\" routine to the third row.\r\n\r\nYou now
    have three rows, one with all the small cap characters, and matching rows with
    the caps & lower case. Each to become a class. The only potential problem I'm
    aware of is the dotted cap I and small cap \"I\" for Turkish. Likely you could
    come across others, in some languages. But since you started with only the small
    caps, the problems will be minimal.\r\n\r\nA similar search of the .afm should
    work for you stylistic variants, which you will have named \".alt\" or \".alt01\"
    \".alt02\" etc. A sort may not be needed, but a text editor that will do that
    can be handy.\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIf I'm making a few changes to a font, I trust
    myself to the new add glyph names to the end of the class row. If there are a
    lot of changes, I write off a new .afm & do the construction work again. It doesn't
    take long.\r\n\r\nI do something a bit different with the numbers; each kind of
    0-9 has its own row. Then other thing also switched with numbers, (dollarsign,
    plus, minus, divide, etc. etc. for lining versus oldstyle) has it's own row, as
    does comma, period if I've made ones up for tabular numbers. Here, the splitting
    into separate rows makes things easier when you have to find things (read: fix
    problems).\r\n\r\nOn purpose, I'm not efficient with classes. I'll make more than
    are needed, so I as a human can find things & work on them. For example, I make
    up separate classes for the features tnum, pnum, onum and lnum. Each feature having
    2 classes e.g., -- tnumb1 and tnumb2 as well as pnum1 and pnum2. The features
    programming doesn't need this -- but it is easier for me as an older human being
    (so I claim) to keep track of things. A real programmer would likely object to
    this wastefulness, and if you're careful, you can use fewer classes & maybe save
    some space in the file. Not my biggest problem.\r\n\r\nBut enough -- if this is
    the sort of thing you're interested in, you get the idea. If not, sorry to waste
    your time."
