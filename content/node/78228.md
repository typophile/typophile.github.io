  has been a little more than a year now since I started a blog on Arabic Typography
  in Arabic. Ever since, I have been trying to find ways to make the blog accessible
  to non-Arabic readers. While my main objective is to increase awareness and build
  capacities in the area of Arabic Typography among the interested Arab youth, I still
  think it is important to make the content of the blog available for a wider extra-Arab
  readership.\r\n\r\nIn ArabicType.Wordpress.com I focus on contemporary Arabic script
  issues and I try to provide useful and inspirational content in a lighthearted flavour.
  It is a demanding task that hardly leaves any time for an English mirror of the
  blog. I did try to start a parallel blog and post summaries of the Arabic blog,
  but I could not systematically update it as I plowed along with the Arabic version.
  Now that I have discovered this Typophile feature, I will test its linkage with
  my established ArabicType.Wordpress.com blog.\r\n\r\nFor those who could read Arabic
  please visit my blog at\r\n[[http://arabictype.wordpress.com]]\r\n\r\nand for those
  who do not speak Arabic, kindly wait for the summaries on this blog.\r\n\r\nBest.\r\n\r\nKhalid
  Muhammed Khalid\r\n"
