  that I am designing for a restaurant/night club.\r\n\r\nThe name is pronounced \"ent-house\"
  and is themed around modern Russian letter forms.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on whether
  the idea is working, and what could be improved would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAaron "

  body: "I don't pronounce either logo as \"house\" when I read it. The 'N' in \"ENT\"
    is turning into a solid block. What's your reason for adding the triangle at the
    top?\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: The reason for adding it was to try and make it similar to a Russian character,
    but I have since removed it. I think it is more legible now.

  body: "The reversed N is already a Russian character, I.\r\n\r\nE and T exist in
    the Russian alphabet, so this would would read something like EIT (je-i-t) in
    Russian.\r\n\r\nThe \xE4 doesn't exist in Russian just in Scandinavian languages.
    Neither a Russian or an English/American would understand it. I'm Scandinavian
    and I don't get the use of \xE4 in \"House\", doesn't make any sense.\r\n\r\nZ
    doesn't exist either. H, Y and E exist but it doesn't spell house.\r\n\r\nI'd
    say either stick to Russian letters completely for ENT HOUSE or don't use them
    at all.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_alphabet\r\n\r\n\r\nOther
    then that the type feels right for a Russian bar, a little stiff and sharp.\r\n\r\nThen
    depending on if it's a bar for Russians or other people it could be an idea too
    look at some old communist fliers and posters. Russians might take offense to
    that but too others it might be neat.\r\n\r\nMight be cool to give at modernized
    communist vintage look :)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.refgrafika.com/blogo/rposter3.jpg\r\nhttp://www.rare-posters.com/3389.jpg\r\nhttp://www.davno.ru/posters/collections/adsold/img/poster-07.jpg\r\nhttp://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWrussiaA.JPG\r\nhttp://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f78/jonjayray/russgun.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter"

  body: Thanks for the feed back, tired to incorporate what you were saying about
    the Russian characters. Decided to use the word house and just have the title
    "ent" looking Russian with the backwards N. What do you think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/crit2_4356.jpg]

  body: "OK This is better. But you could put in some more Russian style lettering
    that reads normal. Like the one you used for \"U\" before. But you may still have
    problems of common letters to both alphabets like E, O, H...\r\n\r\nAnd I'd keep
    the square version of the logo like the old ones and the top left on this latest
    image."

  body: "Looks better. I also prefer the square composition.\r\n\r\nMaybe changing
    the + for a & or the Russian equivalent of &.\r\n\r\nStill don't get the use of
    Z in Houze.\r\n\r\nAlso the EN connection bothers me."

  body: "I don't get the 'Z' either.\r\n\r\nTo make it look Russian, try horizontally
    flipping some the 'R's and 'N's in the bottom line, or replace the 'U' in \"HOUSE\"
    with a '\u0426' (tsi).\r\n\r\n - Lex"
