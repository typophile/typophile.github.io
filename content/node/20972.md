    QType</a> was inspired by club flyers with multiple weights and widths to fit
    the longest or shortest band names.

  body: "FF QTYPE looks good but I'd like similar diversity for less price if its
    availalbe. If need be I might just get one set at a time.\r\n\r\nOXTAIL seems
    great for Restaurants but not so much for the 21-35 Bar crowd. \r\n\r\nI think
    I am thinking more sans-seriff Bold Condensed Fonts for Titles/ display, or maybe
    fonts with grunge textures or ones that look more hand generated, like air brushed.
    What do you think?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Grunged fonts very rarely look good at large sizes where the limits of the
    original drawings are too visible, better to take a clean base font and apply
    your own texture, or there is software called something to do with washing (help?)
    that will apply texture to type, at least repeating characters won't look the
    same.\r\n\r\nAre grunged fonts not reaching the end of their fashionability?\r\nTim"

  body: I think Ed Interlock OTF would be great for use on night club flyers, especially
    if you're using IllustratorCS2 or InDesignCS2 to utilize all the specialized ligatures.

  body: "@timd:  Ahh yes I suppose I can add my own texture to the type that would
    work better.\r\n\r\n@Paul Cutler:  Are their any more filters like those ones?
    Those ones are pretty sweet and i might definately have to use those on some T-shirts
    im gonna do!\r\n\r\n@chris & bobby: House gothic I've always liked. Chalet and
    Ed Interlock OTF are very nice as well.\r\n\r\n@Paul: Ugh Why do type designers
    seem to have un-user-friendly websites? Ahh the veer link is much better thanks.
    Hmm at around $200 a flyer a $5000 font set might be a bit much. Although really
    I would only need to do 25 fliers to get the set...Thats a tough one. \r\n\r\n\"At
    a great pennyworth pause a while\" - I think it works the same for a great cost
    ;) Thanks for all the sugguestions!"

    good type designer does not necessarily a good web developer make. Nor does one
    make enough money to afford a professional site. Thus the role of the reseller."

  body: True but neither does a web developer make enough to buy the typefaces he
    wants. And the sites look fairly professionally made just annoying to use. Store
    sites that are annoying to use would have a much harder time selling their products
    when their are so much easier to use stores selling similar products.
