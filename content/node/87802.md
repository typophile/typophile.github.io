  settled wether it has to be ascending or x-hight.\r\nAny insights?\r\n\r\nB.t.w.,
  I repeatedly face image upload hazard here. Admins, \u2013 any insights?\r\nI\u2019d
  really prefer to show the image directly, attaching a little png is clumsy.\r\n"

  body: It looks like it should be "h". Check the spelling [[http://www.forvo.com/word/%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B3_%D1%88%D3%99%D2%BB%D3%99%D1%80/|here]].

  body: yes I have already seen it use with various fonts but it is not obvious from
    that survey wether the glyph ought to be tall (like h) or small.

    Ok, that't a bit puzzling, I agree.

  body: I have looked at a few of those pdf documents found by google, some being
    official documents, some being newspapers, and all use a font with the tall version
    for the lowercase.

  body: I'm familiar with this letter having an ascender, and only the Apple fonts
    seem to have the short form. I couldn't find the original Unicode proposal document
    for this character -- possibly it was included in one of the large early batches
    of pre-encoded characters --, but did find the proposal document for the related
    <em>shha</em> with spike descender, and the samples used to illustrate the proposal
    all have an ascender.

    I still tend to prefer the ascending form. The sound is actually the same like
    that of \u2039h\u203A (in German, in English).\r\nBut there must be a reason for
    the confusion that half the faces have it small and the other half having it tall.
