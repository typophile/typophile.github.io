  in England in the 1600s.  Specifically, the words I would like to print are those
  of the poem \"Death Be Not Proud\" by John Donne.  This \"Holy Sonnet\" was written
  around 1610 and published in 1633 and I would like to find some fonts that are suited
  to this time period.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nCameron"

    license restrictions that led to a serious decline in English printing.\r\n\r\nDay
    Roman, which is even available free, is based on the work of an English typefounder
    before 1550. Fell dates from about 1700, and Caslon is even later.\r\n\r\nEnglish
    printers often used Dutch types during that period, so Plantin is another possibility."

  body: "This is interesting.\r\n\r\nWilliam Caslon began his typefounding career
    in 1720 or thereabouts. So his type could not possibly adorn a book published
    in 1633.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there's no reason why a typeface from 1633 couldn't
    very strongly resemble Caslon to modern eyes. Caslon was noted as being very similar
    to Dutch typefaces of the period preceding it - and, as I noted, during the 1550-1650
    desuetude of English publishing, Dutch type was much used in England (as I learned
    from Updike).\r\n\r\nIncidentally, some Google searches I made in connection with
    this thread led me to some books by the Elston Press on Google Books; from thence,
    I found this very informative page when looking for information on the types it
    used:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.elstonpress.com/PrivatePressTypes.html]]\r\n\r\nThe
    Elston Press is shown making do with types from ATF, but they had commissioned
    their own Jenson revival for an edition of [[http://www.elstonpress.com/ElstonHouseOfLife.html|The
    House of Life]] by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.\r\n\r\nIn one case, though, Caslon
    Old Roman was pictured - that was a Lanston Monotype face (I see now that they
    must have licensed it from ATF, who got it from Barnhart Brothers), and it was
    a sort of Jenson (a quite lovely one, actually, [[http://www.galleyrack.com/images/artifice/letters/press/comptype/monotype/typography/composite-specimen/lanston-monotype-00780-caslon-old-roman-00781-caslon-old-roman-italic-mtf1-0600grey-001-crop-showing-2384x1048-scale-2048x900.jpg|although
    I find the capital X idiosyncratic]]), despite its name."
