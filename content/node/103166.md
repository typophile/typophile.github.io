  text please (ignore the letters replaced by knife and fork). I'm assuming the numbers
  are in the same font. It's similar to Avenir but not quite right.\r\nMany thanks\r\n"

  body: Agree with Jodie. I think you should have to consider words and numerals are
    not set in the same font because they're definitely not coming from the same type.
