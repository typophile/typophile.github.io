  that was made in the mid-80's by the Powell and Peralta Corp. The name of similar
  typeface's would also be appreciated. Thank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thawkfont_6216.jpg]

  body: "Really doubt it could be a font, more probably a custom lettering for Powell
    & Peralta Tony Hawk deck. You could find [[http://weandthecolor.com/custom-typeface-design-by-macfadden-thorpe/17218|here]]
    a complete alphabet by [[http://www.macfaddenandthorpe.com|McFadden & Thorpe]]
    and based on the classic 80's Tony Hawk deck.\r\nFor the rest, if you still need
    it as vector, that could be pretty easy to trace it from any [[http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/TxfgqHnoyJo/maxresdefault.jpg|big
    sample]] or even redraw it as it is blocky/squarish and only made with straight
    lines (no curves). You don't even need to be strict with lines and alignments
    as the original drawing looks a bit clumsy.\r\nSome candidates for customization
    (more or less work): [[http://www.dafont.com/bionic-type.font|Bionic]], [[http://www.dafont.com/squarefont.font|Squarefont]]"
