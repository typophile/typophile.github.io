  project and looking for pairing a serif typeface with Akkurat:\r\n\r\nhttp://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/\r\n\r\nAkkurat
  is already established, used in the logo and has been used for body text. It is
  for a design agency. The challenge I've had is choosing a serif face to partner
  it. Why? When creating documents with longer passages of text, I'd rather not use
  Akkurat for absolutely everything. A lot of the clients are Universities and in
  the Education sector, and I always feel they prefer serifs as well (albeit ungrounded
  research). \r\n\r\nI've been looking for character shapes that match Akkurat (and
  the usual elements like x-height, descender/ascender height). I feel the old classics
  just aren't doing it: Baskerville, garamond, bembo, sabon, century, even bodoni
  \u2013 they just seem too big a jump. I feel it will be something more 'modern'.
  Even slab serif.\r\n\r\nSo far, I've liked FM by A2 type. I like how it shares the
  square dots i.e. full stop, 'i', 'j'. I am a fan of Publico and Mercury as well,
  but don't feel they are right for this.\r\n\r\nSo that's the pairing challenge \u2013
  appreciate any help.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nLewis"

    came up on the type together site. And there's a free version \u2013 great, will
    try it out. Thanks!"

  body: "\r\nAn update on this. I have found a good, working example of Akkurat with
    a serif face:\r\n\r\nhttp://heydays.no/2009/premiss/\r\n\r\nI think that's exactly
    what I was looking for. I regard myself as very good at identifying sans serifs
    but not as good with serifs, so I can't figure out what has been used for this.
    It is quite similar to Tiempos (Village) but not quite - a thinner version for
    one.. I like the rounded off finishes at the end of some of the stems as opposed
    to a regular serif (in the italic). \r\n\r\nWell, any help in identifying would
    be much appreciated. "

  body: "Sweet Irony. I actually did suspect that when I was looking at it, but it
    was hard to tell. Are you certain? It seems quite thin... maybe it is the 'G1'
    version of it?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpon closer inspection I think it must be. That'll
    teach me to be so dismissive. It is always amazing how many different ways a typeface
    can \"look\" and \"feel\" even though we usually think of the character of a face
    has creating a particular, consistent \"feel\". Context is key. That's why I love
    type!\r\n\r\nSo lesson learnt \u2013 Mercury goes well with Akkurat.\r\n"
