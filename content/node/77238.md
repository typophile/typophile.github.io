  was in need for one, so id like you all to help me out with starting by telling
  me whats poor and what you might like. thanks\r\n\r\nThe restaurant lies in beautiful
  downtown Claremont Ca. Its location, which was once a printing press in the 1920's,
  is now home to a mid-scale restaurant sells pricey wines and entrees, also hosts
  music, there logo is just clip art, so i thought i might attempt to bring some elegance
  to there already exsistent upscale demeanor.( the roman numerals also imply printings
  presses origins)"

  body: "I like the logo, it has a understated class to it. The diamond reminds me
    of a cocktail napkin or coaster in a restaurant setting, which I think is good.\r\n\r\nYou
    could research some 1920's style references for the dividing line maybe, but I
    like the simple straight line.\r\n\r\nThe only issue I could see is restrictions
    when replicating at smaller sizes e.g on the web, or on a business card. The MCMXCV
    might become unreadable depending on the size. Is there a reason for the roman
    numerals being italicised?"
