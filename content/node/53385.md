  for a small local menswear shop.\r\nAfter much discussion the style of font to be
  used has been agreed that of a script/handwriting font.\r\nI've been looking at
  faces such as;\r\n [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000367|Montague]]\r\n

  [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontgarden/fg-bethany/|Bethany]]\r\nWhat I'm really
  after is the flair of these faces but sometng more masculine. Usually I would hand
  draw it but due to time contstraints and budget I need to buy a face.\r\nAn one
  got any suggestions?\r\ncheers in advance\r\nMartin\r\n"

  body: "Elegant, flourished script has been a part of the visual language of selling
    to the male animal since day one. I wouldn't rule it out.\r\n\r\nScript by its
    very nature does not necessarily imply feminine.  Look at the logos of Brooks
    Brothers and other high end menswear advertising over the years.  Stock certificates,
    brokerage houses.  Script was everywhere. And it was manly.\r\n\r\nIf this were
    50 years ago every one on this board would be capable of producing a hundred styles
    of script in seconds with a brush. (Of course there'd be no internet and I wouldn't
    be typing this.)  \r\n\r\nFortunately their work is pilferable.  Go buy a stack
    of magazines from the 50's or some art directors annuals from the day. Find the
    letters you need.  Scan away.\r\n"

  body: I think context comes into play when defining what is masculine or not. Surely
    the same script that Chris links too, arrow and grill removed, pink stripes added
    would be considered feminine. While there are scripts that probably don't change
    given any context I think some do.
