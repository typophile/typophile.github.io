  body: "...and if you are looking for an ID...\r\n\r\n1st Image:\r\n\"The Catcher
    in the Rye\" - it could be <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bell-mt/|Bell
    MT SemiBold]]</strong>\r\n\r\n2nd Image:\r\n\"The Catcher in the Rye\" - it looks
    like <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/new-caledonia/|New Caledonia
    Semi Bold Italic]]</strong> or <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/transitional-511/|Transitional
    511 Bold Italic]]</strong>\r\n\r\nwhile the text body is also close to <strong>New
    Caledonia Semi Bold</strong> \r\nbut it's not a perfect match."

  body: "thank you,\r\ncould be both yeah. They seem kinda old.\r\nHas some one a
    suggestion for this style, but then more modern? So a serif type for books with
    an old feeling like Bell or New Caledonia. Also I will print on roman paper. But
    just want the typeface to slighly look more modern. (but still old)"
