  a scanned package leaflet (sorry for the quality), which should be the starting
  point for a new one i need to make. Unfortunately i don't know my way around with
  fonts. It might be a simple task for others, so please help me out. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prospi_4252.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  text appeared in 2012, in Hungary.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    sure you have a version that contains all the Hungarian diacritical marks.\r\n\r\nNote:
    It looks very familiar to me, I may have even worked on this job.\r\n"
