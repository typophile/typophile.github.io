body: "From a book published in '62... I'm pretty sure the body is Century Expanded,
  but not 100%. I've never seen a swash version of Century for the header (\"The Start
  of the USGA\"). Is it a different face altogether? Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/excerpt_4208.jpg]"

  body: I wouldn't be surprised if some metal foundry produced a swash version of
    Century Italic and it's never been digitized.

  body: "Excellent. I should've picked up the Baskerville header type\u2014that swashy
    T should have given it away. (Hits head repeatedly on desk.)\r\n\r\nI'd never
    heard of DeVinne, though. Century wasn't too far off, apparently: \r\n<cite>This
    revival of the Bruce Foundry\u2019s No. 11 is typical of the nineteenth century
    types derived from the work of Didot and Bodoni; the face remains popular with
    lawyers and government printers. In fact, Theodore Low De Vinne opposed this kind
    of design as hard to print and read; he had Century designed to replace it.</cite>
    \r\n(From the MyFonts description.)\r\n\r\nThanks, Patty!"
