body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nI need some help. Im working on a wedding monogram for a couple
  and I don't really feel the current design. They really like it, but in my infinite
  difficultness it doesn't work for me, so I wont give it to them yet. I have made
  about 30 other compositions but they like this the best.\r\n\r\nI am requesting
  two things; Some critique and maybe a suggestion of a nice classy Hebrew serif font
  that looks similar so I can try to hash this out in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance."

  body: Thats perfect. The lamed is beautiful. I made a mock up and if they like it
    I'll buy the font and do it right. Thank you so much.
