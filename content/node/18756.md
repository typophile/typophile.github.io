  body: Nice, Mike. Where did you gather that info? Perhaps <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.100868.0.0">Maigret</a>
    is that Gradl design?

  body: Are you trying to set lowercase? It's an all caps font with an alternate 'S'
    in the lc slot.

  body: "Stephen, \r\n\r\nI have the Microsoft True Type Mac collection that included
    it. The booklet gives fairly good details about the origin. The lower case was
    designed to complement the original typeface which was apparently only upper case.
    \r\n\r\nThere are a number of adaptations of the Gradl design (shown in the Dover
    book by Ludwig Petzendorfer): Swaak Centennial (Mecanorma), Maigret (Panache);
    Reynolds Caps (Intecsas/Rakowski), Santini (Canada Type); Sarah Caps (Sam Wang);
    and Pigalle (Solotype Catalog)  \r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
