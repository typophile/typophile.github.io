    again, maybe I'm the only person returning emails on the toliet in the morning
    -- just to save some time."

    hildebrant, why's \"professionals\" in parentheses? :)\r\n\r\nOh, found another
    bug: auto links only work when there is a return after the url. For eg, when typing
    http://www.manic.com.sg/blog\r\nhttp://www.typographi.com\r\n\r\nOnly the second
    link works."

  body: "Should have mentioned this earlier. Another, must read, female blog.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.petiteanglaise.com/\">Petite Anglais</a> written from the suburbs
    of Paris. A must read for anyone whom has the hairbrained fantasy of living in
    or at least near the City of Light. A true glimpse inside of what it is to experience
    the day to day in Paris."

  body: Karen, try it again. Apparently every link I posted yesterday didn't work
    as I kept using ":" instead of "=". Silly me.
