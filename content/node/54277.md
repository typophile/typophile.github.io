body: Need some help here on this invite I'm working on. I'm trying to mix many typefaces
  in a complimentary way, and the inspiration is from old signage and packaging. The
  final invites will be screen printed on cloth and ripped out for a rough edge. I've
  been looking at it too long and need some help. Any feedback is great. thanks for
  your time.

  body: "A nice solution to the boring wedding invitation\r\n\r\nEither \"with our
    families\" or \"to share their joy and support their love as they exchange\"\r\n\r\nI
    think \"CHASE\" needs more space, perhaps in letterspacing or leading, or a different
    font. I may be wanting something more flowing, like the rest of the large text.\r\n\r\nThe
    majority has the aesthetic you're looking for, but the bottom has a more crisp,
    neutral, modernist, bland, clean feel. I suggest you change that to match the
    rest.\r\n\r\nEven if you don't change the type on the bottom, you may consider
    removing the line and/or centering the bottom space instead of the whole line
    or adjusting the letterspacing to center it. I think it needs to be centered somehow
    if it's going to be separated like that."

  body: "Thanks for you help.\r\n\r\nGood looking out on the typo, something we didn't
    even notice. I agree about the bottom portion of the invite - it's something that's
    really been bugging me. And I'll work on some more variations in \"CHASE\". I've
    got to work on it some more tonight and I'll post up a new version. Thanks again."
