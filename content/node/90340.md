  body: "Very good.\r\nI have to wonder if instead of trying to think of these off
    the top of our heads, this sort of data (frequent/\xABtypical\xBB letter combinations)
    should/could not better be retrieved from linguistic databases. I seem to remember
    linguistic data for frequent two-letter combinations (Hrant?) and of course frequent
    words; I can't see a reason why this shouldn't also exist (or be retrievable)
    for combinations of 3 or more characters."

  body: "I\u2019m not sure exactly what do you intend with \u201Ctypical syllables
    or letter combinations\u201D. \r\nIf it\u2019s typical as in \u201Cmost frequent\u201D,
    as Nina suggest, the database approach would be a sensible one (maybe starting
    here http://www.onelook.com/).\r\nIf it\u2019s typical as in \u201Cless found
    in other languages\u201D, it could become a difficult task.\r\n\r\nAs for Italian,
    one example of the latter type is \"gli\" (and also the common use of \"l\u2019\"
    and \"L\u2019\" followed by any uppercase or lowercase vowel, but that\u2019s
    a different problem, I suppose). \r\n\r\nEdit: I looked at the generator Craig
    linked to and think it would be less effective than an actual (good) text, at
    least for Italian."

  body: "Andreas, linguistic frequency data tends to be quite plentiful.\r\nBut if
    you want to compile a list of \"tricky\" sequences you'd\r\nhave to be more inventive
    - like assign a trickiness level to\r\neach character and write code to go through
    all the frequent\r\nsequences and order them according to the total trickiness
    value.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    noteworthy tool! Thanks for sharing. To my great distress it does not allow to
    mix Latin with Greek or Cyrillic.\r\nAnyway, it reveals not quite what I am looking
    for.\r\nI try to be more clear. By \u201Ctypical\u201D I do not mean \u201Cmost
    frequent\u201D, but rather \u201Cmost characteristic\u201D, like <strong>heit
    lich ung</strong> in German, for instance.\r\nMaybe, it\u2019s a similar question
    like that for actual useful ligatures \u2026\r\n\r\n"

    a more practical document than the UN\r\ndeclaration is the small warning fold-out
