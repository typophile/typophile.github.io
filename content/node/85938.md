body: "I'm looking for some ideas on font pairings for labels which will have a medicine
  type of look. I might go for a 1800's style, something like [[http://www.whale.to/a/chloroform.jpg|this]],
  but probably something more modern like [[http://www.whale.to/a/biphetamine.jpg|this]].
  Any suggestions at all are appreciated though. I'm kind of drawing a blank here.\r\n\r\nThe
  final product will be printed at 180dpi, about 1\" high and 1-1.5\" wide. The composition
  will be a company name, then the main focus on the product name, with \"drug information\"
  below. The \"drug information\" will probably require a condensed font, and I need
  to pay attention to the form of \"mg\" and the % glyph. Thanks =)"

  body: "fredrikrob: this is for \"e-liquid\", basically nicotine+flavoring used with
    electronic cigarettes. \r\n\r\nThe companies get pretty poor treatment from regulators,
    first trying to get them shut down as making medical claims, and now they are
    treated as more harmful, conventional tobacco products. So, we are sort of trying
    to make a statement about this with the typeface(s).\r\n\r\ntypodermic: I'm still
    not sure I like anything but the condensed DDT 100%, but looking at the label
    in your [[http://typodermicfonts.com/widefont-is-wide|Widefont is Wide]] post
    made me like it more. I'll definitely consider these because it is close to one
    design I had in mind.\r\n\r\nOff topic, I like your [[http://typodermicfonts.com/magnetic-ink-wheaton-recognition|Wheaton]].
    I appreciate type but I've never and maybe never will create a face myself. For
    some reason a while back, I really wanted to make a face which is a mixture of
    that \"60's computer font\" with fraktur. Somehow they seem compatible and I want
    to see it made. If you do, I would totally buy it."

  body: "I did now, and those are neat but not what I was talking about. There's a
    unique \"language\" to both blackletter and that sort of MICR style fonts and
    I wanted to combine them. I probably shouldn't have said fraktur. I think it is
    other blackletter that has more of a wide-narrow \"language\" like MICR, then
    I wanted to draw on some of the quirky-unreadable aspects of both. This could
    be a horrible idea, and I don't know how to explain it better than that, but that
    was what I wanted to attempt.\r\n\r\nI was lucky to live near a \"free bookstore\"
    a while back and picked up some old ones on designing type. There was a name of
    this type of MICR font but with not only numerals, and I even made a few sketches
    before giving up, but I would have to go back to this when I have more time. Got
    enough hobbies I am bad at for now =)"

  body: '@analog Good idea. I think MICR would work well with a heavy metal fraktur
    (Squealer, Graveblade etc) . . . will experiment. Cheers.'
