  body: "Yes, I think these look like cut-out letters (notice the two O's have different
    counters), maybe with light coming from behind them (see the lower corner of the
    I in LIVE). Without a G, R, J, C or M we are missing many of the more useful letters
    for font ID of a Sans font, so you could pick nearly any condensed Sans and we
    could have no objection.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
