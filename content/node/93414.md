  recognize this font that is \r\n-- sort of serif-y\r\n-- and has horizontal lines
  across lower case letters.\r\n--It has diamonds over all vowels, and under the s\r\n--The
  ampersand is pretty wild with a long wavery tail\r\n--some of the letters are above
  or below the horizontal pediment\r\n--there is a little decorative blip at the top
  of the rounds of the lower case letters\r\n--The Capital letters are seeming tilted
  forward or back a bit\r\n-- it is from a wordpress blog page, probably made in the
  last couple years\r\n--I thought at first it might be hand drawn, which I think
  I could do, but will also have to take out ''steady hand insurance\" or else it
  might really run uphill and downhill. lol\r\n\r\nThank you for reading my words.\r\nKind
  regards,\r\nArchangel\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Dear RiccardO\r\n\r\nThank you so much. Arabia-ish it is.  I noticed as I
    perused the 'found' type file on your site last night that you ought to be titled
    \"grand font finder.\" I'm appreciative. \r\n\r\nThe part I didnt understand of
    your message was 'post on the main Type ID Board.' I looked for that and could
    not find it. On my cpu, these are the choices: Type ID Faq and posting guidelines/
    Type ID Pop Quiz/ Solved IDs/ sans serif/ serif/ script, handwriting/ display/
    blackletter/ dingbat, symbol/ mixed, various/. Then it moves to the forum list
    of questions and answers. \r\n\r\nCould you send me the URL to where you want
    me to post? Thank you. I am very new-ish at your site. \r\n\r\nwith kind regards,\r\narchangel"
