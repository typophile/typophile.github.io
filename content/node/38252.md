  of EF/SG's Europa Grotesk, Europa Grotesk No. 1, and Europa Grotesk No. 2, other
  than stroke thicknesses. Any help? Each version seems to be a modest variation on
  Akzidenz Grotesk, AG Old Face, and/or Helvetica. This does not concern the headline
  vs. text versions of their fonts, so I link to just the SH versions of them below.

  body: "Lorem, that's exactly what I needed to know. I use Neue Helvetica alot, I
    want display versions of it in several weights. URW Nimbus Sans Novus has display
    versions, but the track isn't as tight as I'm looking for at large point sizes.
    EG #2 SH will work perfectly. \r\n\r\nThanks much!\r\n"

  body: "If you only need it for display purposes, ok.\r\nBut is it not better to
    buy SB (text) version and apply tight tracking (using software) in headlines?\r\n\r\nSH
    versions use to have a lesser count of characters - compare for yourself:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-no-2-sb/lig/opentype-ps/253647/\r\n(230
    characters in SB version)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-no-2-sh/lig/opentype-ps/254225/\r\n(198
    characters only in SH version)\r\n\r\nScangraphic SB and SH sometimes (not always)
    differ (except tracking) in two ways:\r\nSB (text) versions have ink traps which
    is ugly in big sizes\r\nSH (headline) versions have a different positioning of
    diacritics.\r\nIn very rare cases, some characters differ as well. (Compare Futura
    SH X-Light and SB X-Light numbers.)\r\n\r\nBut if there's no difference in character
    shapes and the only difference is tracking, I would go for SB version and apply
    custom tracking in big sizes. Or you could also buy the original Helvetica Neue.

    times, I can only create documents in something like MS Word--where typographic
    controls are crude. I need some display weights for those instances. You are of
    course correct though, when using InDesign or some other layout program, manual
    kerning and tracking of headlines is the way to go.\r\n\r\nThanks for the headsup
    on the differing character sets btw, I hadn't noticed that.\r\n\r\n>>Or you could

    in the 25/26 through 95/96 weights for years. Couldn't live without them.\r\n"
