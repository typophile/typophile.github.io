body: "Hey people,\r\n\r\nIt's common for a Black weight (or a bold) to have a higher
  x-height than the regular as an optical correction, while the ascender/descender
  height are usually kept the same to create visiual harmony in a typefamily. However,
  by increasing the x-height, the ascenders will look shorter, making the descenders
  look too long (or the ascenders too short). Is there any solution for this, or is
  it just something I'll have to live with? Would it be a problem if the descender
  height differs between Regular and Black?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nJasper de
  Waard"

  body: If a black is intended for display, as it is in most cases, shorter descenders
    would come in handy for setting lines tighter.

  body: "I'd certainly recommend rebalancing the ascenders and descenders as you don't
    want them to look different lengths. Normally in text fonts ascenders are slightly
    longer than descenders. At the end of the day, type families need to look as though
    they have the same proportions (which isn't purely a matter of linear dimensions
    but also of relative areas and overall colour). This means that my answer would
    be to compare the regular weight with the black weight, using example words with
    descenders and ascenders, and shorten/lengthen the extenders until they click
    across weights. \r\n\r\nIn my font Mint, that I'm currently working on, the Fat
    ascenders are slightly taller than the Medium, but the descenders are the same
    length."

  body: 'ohh and, nina: I kinda forgot about that previous thread I started and your
    thread is intersting, but none of this says anything on the relation between descender
    and x-height/descender and ascender. Thanks anyway ;-D'
