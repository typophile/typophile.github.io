  body: I suspect the differences is rendering is due to your .otf being Postscript-flavoured
    and your .woff TrueType-flavoured. They are also too small to render clearly with
    so much detail.

  body: "Hello and thank you for your interest!\r\n\r\nAs far as i know both files
    are Postscript, sfnt2woff exports Postscript as well as fontsquirrel.com. The
    renderer is Firefox 19.0.\r\n\r\nI am rethinking my approach to shading with other
    methods, it was an interesting test but all round inefficient approach. I have
    found a new way by using CSS in the mix!\r\n\r\nAK"

  body: "Yes, sfnt2woff can export Postscript, but Fontsquirrel does not. If you do
    intend to make icons this small, you\u2019ll benefit from much more simplied shapes,
    TrueType outlines and hinting instructions. And yes, shading is better done with
    CSS."
