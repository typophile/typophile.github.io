  signage, reading and legibility. \r\n\r\nWe are looking for exciting wayfinding/signage
  projects, scientific research/articles about these topics, typefaces made for special
  reading problems and so on. \r\nFeel free to contact me, if you have or know any
  interesting material or post a suggestion here.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nRalf Herrmann\r\n\r\n"
