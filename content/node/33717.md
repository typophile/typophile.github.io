body: "im looking for a chunky, interesting (of course) font for an online blog/news
  source website. the client actually used the word \"webby\". one direction was serifa
  or clarendon, but if anyone has any other suggestions, i would appreciate them.
  in the meantime, i found this, though not sure what it is. definitely falls into
  the more interesting category.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n"

    would do well on the web.
