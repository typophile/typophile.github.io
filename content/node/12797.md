  body: "The closest match I could find for this was <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?nCo=AFMT&PID=ITC8179\"
    target=\"new\">ITC Tabula</a>, but the '&' is different. The site sample is not
    quite big enough to see whether the strokes of the C and S taper the same way.\r\n\r\nIf
    this lettering is from British official government documents, it is very possible
    that this is not a commercially available font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Mike, thanks for looking. I'm sure I've seen those odd tapering terminals
    somewhere else.\r\n\r\nSomebody at work reminded me of this other logo (for a
    UK rail passenger service)which could easily be the lower case.\r\n\r\nRichard

  body: The Inland Revenue typeface is a rather rushed (rediculous deadline causing
    near nervous breakdown;-) modification of a typeface called Modena that I've been
    working on for some years. I'll finish it this year.

    I always use the <strong>target=\"new\"</strong> tag, but don't ask me where I
