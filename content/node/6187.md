    your information, Abraham, as a general rule credits at the  <BR>bottom of movie

  body: 'Hey, H B M, keep me out of this, willya?! <BR> <BR>====== <BR> <BR>Wow. That
    was a joke. My idea is/was the same as Mr. Mark Simonson wrote here: <BR> <BR>
    <BR>BTW, Scully, you won&#39;t get much help here looking for &#34;FREE&#34; versions
    of commercial fonts. Many of the experts here are in the font business &#40;that&#39;s
    how come we know so much about fonts&#41;. You might as well go to a bank and
    ask them if they know anywhere to get counterfeit money. <BR> <BR>=================
    <BR> <BR>Oh, well.  <BR> <BR>'
