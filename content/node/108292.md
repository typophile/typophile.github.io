  body: "You first, Hrant. Also, go fuck yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon who runs this
    joint censors our expression via automation but refuses to tend to its years-long
    spam problem. He has no trouble posting jobs for the LDS Church on his Twitter
    feed, though.\r\n\r\nEssentially, you cunts are defending spammers. I decry them.
    But only those with administrator access, like that Mormon, can actually stop
    the spammers. "

    damage than you. Unless you can adapt and forego cursing, instead of defining
    yourself here by primadonna hissy-fits. I'm assuming you can't, but feel free
    to prove me wrong.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a part of Punchcut, or Typophile, at least not officially.\r\n\r\nBleeping out
    certain words on Typophile has nothing to do with my religious beliefs, but rather
    accessibility in schools, libraries, etc.\r\n\r\nSo you got to blame THIS Mormon,
    not the other one. But congrats, you caught me on a day where I have no patience
    for your remarks. Enjoy the ban.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    that gets bleeped...\r\n\r\nI don't give a rosy red rat's patootie about having
    certain profanities, vulgarities, and obscenities (yup, they're different) bleeped.
    Been known to use them myself. In fact, for years I thought my wife's permanent
    blush was a matter of my, uh, physical prowess. Nope. Turns out I'm just an average
    guy who takes the name of  God in vain too often, and that embarrasses her. You're
    probably suffering from a similar delusion...\r\n\r\nWhy not joint the ranks of
    people who communicate -- communication being a two way street, all parties comfortable.
    Typophile's not a place for \"artistic\" expression, vulgar or otherwise. Go create
    fonts no one wants to use to satisfy such urges.\r\n\r\nAs for all spamming: the
    few sites I visit <strong>all</strong> seem to be losing a battle to spammers.
    How you can blame the people at Typophile for the spam attacks shows only that
    you're unaware Typophile is getting to be important as a resource. \"important
    as a resource\" is also known as \"target.\"\r\n\r\nSuggest you worry more about
    any on-line accessible bank accounts you might have, and what you'll do for electrons,
    water, etc.  when the spammers get just a bit more powerful. It is no longer a
    matter where site-by-site efforts will succeed."

    any bearing on spammers or anything else on this site.  I am an atheist and I
    am offended at such bigotry.

  body: "BTW, FWIW I've been on Twitter since June, and there are not infrequent cases
    of an <em>account being taken over</em> \u2013if temporarily\u2013 by spammers,
    which is much worse than a \"stand-alone\" spammer. But to me worse still is the
    not infrequent use of foul language; for one thing it prevents me from retweeting
    an otherwise worthy opinion \u2013 often it even prevents me from replying to
    it, lest I appear to be supporting use of foul language (which I consider to be
    an expression of weakness in objectivity, self-control and especially communication).\r\n\r\nAlso:
    I'm not religious (although neither am I an atheist) and I'm not blind to certain
    problems that formal religion can foster, but discriminating against religions
    is the most offensive belief of all.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
