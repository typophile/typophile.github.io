  body: "The Sterling typeface, designed by Joshua Darden, was created exclusively
    for Tiffany by H&FJ (now H&Co); it is not commercially available: \r\n\r\nhttp://designarchives.aiga.org/#/entries/%2Bid%3A640/_/detail/relevance/asc/0/7/640/sterling-type-family/1\r\n\r\nBecause
    it's not based on any one historical source, you won't find a match in other digital
    fonts.\r\n\r\nAnd Pentagram evidently just did a refresh of the main logo, also
    custom:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pentagram.com/work/#/all/all/newest/298/"
