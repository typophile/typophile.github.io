  a masters program in book publishing at Oxford Brookes University. We currently
  live near Washington, DC, so right now we are going through all the crap that goes
  along with moving internationally. I've started to dip my toes into the water and
  have begun looking around for any leads for job opportunities over there and am
  realizing that I have no clue where to start looking.\r\n\r\nI'm really only looking
  for internship opportunities to start, so I've started keeping a list of any design
  firms that look like they might be a good fit for me in the Oxford/London area,
  and figured I would send out my resum\xE9 / portfolio and hope any of them bite.\r\n\r\nNow
  my questions are such:\r\n\r\nIt appears that bus or train travel to London from
  Oxford is readily available, with a commute time of 1hour for train and up to 1:45
  for Bus (depending on the area). Are there any people who know anything about the
  Oxford/London area and whether a commute to London from Oxford would be suicide
  or if it would be feasible?\r\n\r\nAre there online resources for design jobs in
  the UK that someone can point me to? (I'm sure there are and I just don't know them)\r\n\r\nAre
  there any design firms that you suggest I add to my list?\r\n\r\nAny other tips?\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much for any help you all can give me.\r\n\r\n<em>penn</em>"

    that you will enjoy your time in Oxford. It can be a great place to live.\r\n\r\nA
    lot of people commute from Oxford to London, both by train and bus. The bus is
    relatively comfortable and pretty reliable. The train is quicker but more expensive.
    Both are cheaper with monthly or annual passes. The return trains which most people
    catch can be crowded, and sometimes it is difficult to find a seat. The key thing
    to look at is where exactly in London the job is. You do not want to spend an
    additional hour in each direction commuting within London.\r\n\r\nTrains arrive
    at Paddington station, so you should look for something close by. The bus is more
    flexible and stops in two or three places in Central London.\r\n\r\nHope it works
    out.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    maybe have a look here: http://www.dezeenjobs.com/\r\nIt's mostly architecture
    / product design oriented, but there is the occasional graphic design listing
    too.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
