  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Though I generally shy away from any article that involve phrases like &ldquo;<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/70983">Reinventing the Book</a>&rdquo;, I’m still mighty curious about Amazon&rsquo;s font selection for its Monday-launched e-book device, Kindle. I mean, for starters, out of all typeface in the world, why <a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2007/11/18/amazon-kindle-ebook.html">Caecilia</a>?</p>
<p>However, I think that Amazon might have gotten it right this time, because the device was:
<ul>
<li>Birthed with a culturally-centered principles, and</li>
<li>Built by sociologists and ethnographers</li>
</ul>
As quoted from the article:
<blockquote>...he [Jeff Bezos] ticks off a number of attributes that a book-reading device...must have. First, it must project an aura of bookishness; it should be less of a whizzy gizmo than an austere vessel of culture.</blockquote>
<p>Compare this with <a href="http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/">Sony Reader's</a>:
<ul>
<li>Feature and benefit-centered principle, and</li>
<li>Clunky reading interface that attempted to mirror exactly the appearance of a physical book or a PDF file (that looked like it was designed by a programmer instead of a sociologist). Look, dudes, with every new medium must come a new presentation model that is specifically suited to that medium, even if the contents themselves are old and dusty.</li>
</ul>
As quoted from their website copy:
<blockquote>The Sony® Reader provides a new way to experience reading. It boasts an impressive display, utilizing breakthrough technology that’s almost paper-like. In addition, the text can be magnified for sight-impaired readers. Daylight readable, high contrast, high resolution, near 180º viewing angle.</blockquote>
<p>I think that if any revolution is to take place, it has to take the human spirit into account. From what I’ve read so far, Amazon seemed to do just that; but it remains to be seen whether those words were true to principle or just extremely empathic/clever PR.</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

I hope it&rsquo;s better in person.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the type on Kindle is that paragraphs are full-justified and the layouts are not designed, just plain text.</p>

<p>I have to disagree, but not entirely. When I want quick, up-to-date documentation I don’t want to mess around with an ebook, I want something like the Adobe help system. Sifting through a PDF or ebook is better than paper, but having it all cross-linked and organized hierarchically in a help app is much more efficient.</p>

<p>Well, help != documentation/manuals IMHO. They are both useful, but both different.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>With all these talks, then, why would you ever want to read on an ebook device over a regular book? I’m mighty curious, because our community is pretty steeped in tradition.</p>
<p>For me, it’s a question of habit. I’m used to reading one storybook at one time before finishing it and moving on to another book. Had I have a habit of reading, say, 3 novels at a time, or doing a comparative study of some sorts, then I might use Kindle to save some space on my bag. That’s the only reason for using that I can think of.</p>
<p>Again, the question of the day is “why would you ever want to read on an ebook device over a regular book?” I’d love to know all of your opinions.</p>
<p>I also think that if a multifunction device like Kindle is to succeed, it’s got to offer something more than just <em>convenience.</em> <a href="http://linkenfuego.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/i-have-now-just-realized-that-the-web-development-software-coda-is-equal-to-iphone-in-spirit/">After the iPod, everything also has to be <em>elegant.</em></a> And I’m not just talking about it in the physical sense, but also in the user interaction and mental sense.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=BKUKQ7QqOHw">Watching its instructional video</a> almost made me wish for an iPhone-like interface. Everyone in <a href="http://typophile.com/node/39250">lazyeye88’s post</a> would agree, no ;^) ?</p>
