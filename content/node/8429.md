  body: You could try <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html"
    target="_blank">Gotham</a> from Hoefler/Frere-Jones. Also <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/"
    target="_blank">Avenir</a>. Both have nice round characters like your sample.
    Your sample is a bit small to really see the font.

  body: I FINALLY realized what you all are talking about. Frankly, I couldn&#39;t
    tell that was a font the first 4 or 5 times I looked at it and find it nearly
    impossible to read.  <BR> <BR>My suggestion is if you don&#39;t need a lot of
    characters, that you make your own. I think people spend way too much time on
    this forum looking for fonts that they could very easily create themselves and
    save time, money, as well as have something truly original.
