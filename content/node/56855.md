  a way to generate a text to print on the fore edge that doesn\u2019t involve doing
  it manually.\r\nDoes it make sense?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I am student, and it is for
  a school project.\r\n"

  body: 'Hmm. Here''s how I would do it: Most graphics programs have a setting for
    the "paste offset", which is where the content of the clipboard will be dropped
    relative to where it was picked up. If your layout software has this, set it to
    move left a distance that equals the width of the image or text you want on the
    edges (stretching it wider than it will actually appear may help with the math
    and to straighten telltale curves) divided by the number of right-hand pages in
    the book. On the first page, place your image or text almost all the way off the
    page, the left edge of it just barely on the right edge of the page. Copy it.
    Turn the page. Paste. While it''s still selected, copy it again. Turn the page.
    Paste. Copy. Repeat until you''re done. Then go through again and crop each instance
    to a guideline so only that strip on the edge of the page shows up. I can''t think
    of a way to make it more automated than that. You could set up keystroke macros
    if you''re into that sort of thing, but it''s probably easier to just do it.'

    there was a way to create the image automatically. \r\nBut thanks a lot, I will
    go ahead and give it a shot"
