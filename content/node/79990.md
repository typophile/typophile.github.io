body: "I love the Intellecta Monograms family and just bought a bunch of the sets
  to use in engraved custom stationery design. However, they're nearly unusable without
  some kind of keyboard or character map.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nHow are users supposed
  to be able to find anything? I've gone all of the glyphs for each set but it's making
  my brain hurt. Ugh. Does anyone know of a guide to these fonts? \r\n\r\nDon't get
  me wrong, they are beautiful but I'm disappointed. Can anyone offer any support
  here? Perhaps user paulow can help.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for something just like this:

    here, he might see this.
