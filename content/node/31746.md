  body: "Monotype Bodoni is one of the few Bodoni's that has the flat-topped 't',
    but the 'g' has a much smaller ear. I think this also has a strong resemblance
    to Walbaum designs, except that the 's' has a Bodoni-like serif. I'd guess it's
    a custom face designed for them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
