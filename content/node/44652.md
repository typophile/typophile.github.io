  font Pablo uses in one of his logo ideas in his second post, the logo on the right.
  It reminds me of the face used for Australia's tourism branding. I don't even know
  what search terms to use to find something like it.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what
  it is? Or one similar?\r\n\r\n(In case the image doesn't display, you can see it

    (w/alts)]] from Font Bureau, but I think this is a 'personal' (custom) font design,
    of the kind we describe in our FAQ about hand-printed fonts. Easy and cheap to
    do.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
