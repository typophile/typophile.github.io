    that corner is 10 x 10 units, it can't possibly mess up the hinting, can it? But
    can it mess up something else? I've struggled a lot with all those corners, but

  body: "Nina kindly asked me to comment on this thread, probably because we (FontFont)
    resp. our outline guidelines were responsible for lots of the extremum points
    she and Hrant had to put in on Ernestine ;)\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say, in general it
    is the safest bet to put on-curve points at all curve extremes. Some font checking
    tools insist on this and give you error messages otherwise (like FontLab\u2019s
    FontAudit, FontQA, or MS FontValidator). But you can get away with fewer, and
    should try too, because otherwise the curve fidelity may be compromised in some
    cases, depending on what formats the fonts will be produced in, and the kind of
    hinting that will be applied. You already see that it\u2019s a complicated issue.\r\n\r\nI
    tried to find an example glyph to illustrate all extremum issues, it\u2019s really
    hard to show everything in one glyph, but I\u2019ll try ...\r\n\r\nThe general
    order of importance (from most important extremum points to least) would be:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Points
    that are relevant for hinting (PostScript as well as TrueType if the fonts will
    be produced as such)</li>\r\n<li>Points at global extrema (for calculation of
    glyph and font bounding boxes)</li>\r\n<li>Points at local extrema</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nIn
    this example, I drew the glyph AE like this and removed overlaps:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AE-Extrema_4164.png]\r\n\r\nAt
    extremum 1 there should be an on-curve point because it influences the glyph bounding
    box and would be needed for hinting.\r\n\r\nExtremum 2 and 5 would define a stem
    hint in both PS and TT hinting and should be marked with an on-curve point.\r\n\r\nExtremum
    3 and 7 are local extrema, not influencing the bounding box or needed for hinting,
    I would leave them as it is (but the curve is long enough so it would be possible
    to put in a point and preserve the curve shape).\r\n\r\nExtremum 4 and 6 would
    be tricky to insert an additional point, I\u2019d leave it as it is.\r\n\r\nIn
    extremum 8 I would probably try to adjust the existing point so it would become
    the extremum point.\r\n\r\nExtremum 9 is a glyph-global extremum and makes the
    bounding box bigger than necessary, I\u2019d add a point here.\r\n\r\n10 is important
    for hinting, insert a point.\r\n\r\n11 influences the bounding box, insert a point
    if at all possible (if there\u2019s a point at 10, then the handle at 11 will
    get smaller, and it would probably be acceptable to leave out the extremum point.
    This would be like the point in Sindre\u2019s example).\r\n\r\nExtrema like 1,
    which make the bounding box bigger on the top or bottom of a glyph, have to be
    considered extra carefully, because they may occur on the tallest glyph in the
    font and thus influence the line height calculation (which you usually want to
    keep as small as possible).\r\n\r\nSometimes it\u2019s possible to move the points
    and handles surrounding the extrema and keep the curves looking OK, but if the
    PostScript curves are just on the border of being distorted, in very tight places,
    they may blow up when converted to TrueType. Then you could either correct the
    TT curves manually, or increase the UPM of the font before converting to TT. Of
    course, if you\u2019re not going to produce fonts with TrueType outlines, you
    don\u2019t have to worry about this."

  body: "Here\u2019s another example in which the needed points depend on what kind
    of hinting you are planning to apply.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n-Extrema_5081.png]\r\n\r\nPoints
    1 and 2 would not be needed for global extrema, and are hard to put in because
    the curve is so narrow (there is only 1 unit (at 1000 upm) in x-direction between
    the tangent point and the extremum point at (2) and 2 units in x-direction at
    (1) so the curves are a bit flat if you look closely enough. They will certainly
    be flat when converted to TrueType.\r\n\r\nIf you do only y-direction TT-hinting,
    and your PS hinting style is such that you don\u2019t hint vertical rounds in
    an Italic (as I often do), you could omit the extremum points. But if you want
    to put PS hints there, or do x-direction TT hinting, the points would be needed.\r\n\r\nWe
    ended up increasing the upm size to 2000 and remodeling the curves at the extremum
    points in this case."

      is impossible to keep uncompromised with an inflection point inserted. Maybe
      it has to do with my current drawing style (I use few straight lines), but I
      find that it happens a lot. Seems like FontAudit ignores such cases too.

    to me explicit inflection points are very important, and often actually more important
    than extrema; when they're missing conversion to TT is a crapshoot.\r\n\r\nSo
    of your three options, I would choose #3 if I can make the curve look nice, and
    #2 if it's impossible to get a good shape with all those points (without increasing
    the EM).\r\n\r\nAnother technical thing here is the avoidance of what I call \"half-dead\"
    curves: curves where only one point has a handle - this is also a TT-conversion
    minefield. Which is a shame since I find them very elegant to work with. Luckily
    in FL Alt-Shift-Click* adds the missing handle and balances the other one (although
    usually a subsequent tweak is required).\r\n\r\n* However Alt-Shift is also the
    default way to switch keyboards/languages in Windows, so I find myself having
    to hit Alt-Shift after every Alt-Shift-Click!  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
