  interested in typography, there are endless limits to what you can do. My chosen
  filed of study will mainly focus on Experimental/Expressive Typography and I would
  like to explore this topic more further. The purpose of this project is to investigate
  the idea of legibility, readability, style, movement and how type can be taken beyond
  its basic and what Experimental Typography really means. The word \"experiment\"
  oxford dictionary define as a scientific procedure undertaken to make a discovery,
  demonstrate a known fact or a course of action tentatively adopted without being
  sure of the outcome. In this context, an experiment is a test of idea; set of actions
  to prove or disprove an idea. In a graphic design and typography, experiment as
  a noun has been used to signify anything new, unconventional, defying easy categorization,
  or confounding expectations. This is something what I wish to explore within this
  project.\r\nCould you give me some advice or how I could possible narrow this down??\r\nTHANX"

    the span of time and/or place you consider. For example, early XX century in Europe,
    or the 1990s in the USA.*\r\nOr you could try to give it a wide (thus somewhat
    superficial) historical perspective.\r\n\r\n* http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-digital-past-when-typefaces-were-experimental"

  body: "I would ask you what you consider a historic example of \"Experimental\"
    typography just so I can understand where you are coming from personally.  Oxford
    is of no help in this since people other  than true scientists view the word experimental
    in many ways that be be untestable.\r\n\r\n\"...purpose of this project is to
    investigate the idea of legibility, readability, style, movement and how type
    can be taken beyond its basic and what Experimental Typography really means.\"\r\n\r\nThis
    is a huge broad area and I would confine it to something you can write in your
    lifetime let alone when the assignment is due. :-)\r\n\r\nLegibility/readability
    opens a HUGE can of worms which cannot be done in time for your project.  These
    things border on science or at least soft-science and require knowledge that you
    probably don't have.\r\n\r\nI would first decide if you are going to talk about
    experimental type design or experimental type usage.  Pick one that will be doable
    for you.  My guess is that type usage would be less daunting.\r\n\r\nNext, pick
    a practitioner or 2 who has work that shows what you are talking about.  You may
    also choose a style or school of work to focus on. Examples might be DaDa or Constructivists
    or more current things like Grunge. Mostly, pick what really interests YOU. Yo
    may choose to contrast say the experimental work of Emil Ruder with his student
    Weingart for how one persons ideas were transferred and changed by another.  Or
    else you might contrast the older DaDa work with Grunge or some other thing that
    you have an interest in.  You might also look at painterly done lettering by early
    20th French painters with Bauhaus lettering from the same time period. Perhaps
    compare Lautrec to El Lizzitsky or just one Moula Rouge poster to a Weimar 1923
    poster?\r\nBasically, find some examples of work online that shows what you mean
    and either attempt to research it or compare 2 styles of experimentation.  You
    won't have time for more than that."

  body: "THANKS for the replay\r\n\r\nAfter more research I have decided focus on
    typography in era of modernism and postmodernism. This will allow me to examine
    and compare two different typographic styles which came one after the other. I
    want to question the ideologies of modernist (Emil Ruder) consisting that of a
    formalist, rationalist nature to that of a Postmodernist (Wolfgan Weingart) more
    expressive, subjective and experimental nature through a series of methods but
    also question how they could work in today\u2019s extremely multicultural society.
    Questioning graphic design of certain times and trying to get a better understanding
    of the ideologies and what affected them. I planned to do this in a number of
    ways to gain a more intense knowledge of design history. So I can come to acknowledge
    the deeper messages of their work rather than just visual inspiration. So I really
    feel the need to study their reasoning in much more detail.\r\n\r\nthanks for
    all your comments\r\n"
