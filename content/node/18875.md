  using Fournier for the text and <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/products/franklin.html\">P22's
  Franklin's Caslon</a> for the main display, giving it a little bit of a period feel.
  I'd like something else for everything else (pull quotes, etc.), and I was thinking
  about <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/ihof/operinapro.html\">P22's Operina</a>... it
  feels a little like a clash though. Can anyone recommend some substitutions (for
  any of the three but especially Operina)?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nZach."

  body: You could use the Caslon italic for the pull quotes and the roman for the
    display type which would bring you down to two fonts instead of three.
