  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This blog entry marks the first in what is planned to be a series of reports documenting the design of my first font. An internal grant at UST has supported this project, which I call <em>Researching by Doing: Designing a Humanist Sans Typeface</em>.</p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from my grant proposal that help to explain the rationale and plan:</p>
<p><cite>The premise of this proposal is that there are insights about the process of type design that I can best obtain by undertaking that process myself. By designing a font and submitting my design for critique, I aim to develop a more sophisticated visual acumen for the evaluation of type design. Furthermore, by designing a font to meet the same demands met by the class of historical types I study (the twentieth-century class known as “humanist sans-serifs”), I expect to discover some of the same design hurdles confronted by the designers of those types. I will acquire font-design software, learn its use, design a font, subject my design to evaluation from experts in the field, and revise my design. I will also keep a journal of biweekly reflections on my efforts. This journal will be published as a weblog (itself subject to expert commentary) and will culminate in a report on the insights into historical type designs that I have gleaned from the contemporary process of font design.</cite></p>
<p><cite>There are four humanist sans types that form the foundation of this project. The humanist sans serif category of type may only have emerged by name as late as the 1980s, but these typefaces from earlier in the century are commonly regarded as key precedents in its establishment. In the late nineteen-twenties, English sculptor Eric Gill produced Gill Sans, which has become the most widely used of the humanist sans types. German designer and calligrapher Hermann Zapf produced Optima in 1952, inspired by Florentine Renaissance inscriptions. Swiss designer Adrian Frutiger developed his eponymous type in response to a 1968 commission for signage at the Charles De Gaulle International airport. That same year, Frutiger’s countryman Hans Eduard Meier designed Syntax-Antiqua, inspired by his studies of writing. These four types, Gill Sans, Optima, Frutiger, and Syntax-Antiqua, varied in their inspiration and application, but all aimed at a similar overarching goal: to discard the serifs and marked contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes) of traditional seriffed letterforms while retaining a sense of comfort, refinement, and warmth that went missing in earlier so-called “grotesque” and “geometric” sans designs.</cite></p>
<p><cite>I will begin the process by inventing a complete “design brief” for the typeface that is based on what can be documented or inferred about the commissions for the great humanist sans serif types of the twentieth century: Gill Sans, Optima, Frutiger, and Syntax-Antiqua. This brief will provide the guiding parameters for my own design. Then I will set to work designing a single weight of a font, minimally upper- and lowercase letters, numerals, and common punctuation. I will regularly (at least biweekly) report my progress, concerns, and insights on a weblog hosted by typophile.com. At milestones of the design (all capital letters completed, for example) I will also post the design to typophile.com’s critique forum and respond to any feedback provided by its members.</cite></p>
<p>Stay tuned if you&rsquo;re interested in following my progress (if I can be so optimistic), and wish me luck!</p>
