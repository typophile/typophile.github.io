  body: All I can contribute is that the fish is a codfish &#40;it has three dorsal
    fins&#41;. It looks like something that might have been an old trademark, possibly
    for something like cod liver oil.

  body: Sure enough. I did a Google Image search on Cod liver oil and found <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=americanhistory.si.edu/anatomy/images/global/history/scotscod.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://americanhistory.si.edu/anatomy/history/nma03_history_whatis.html&amp;h=258&amp;w=156&amp;sz=12&amp;tbnid=5myXz8Dmq-YJ:&amp;tbnh=105&amp;tbnw=64&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3DCod%2Bliver%2Boil%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26sa%3DG"

    liver oil&#41; from 1890. This was their trademark since 1886, according to the
    article there.
