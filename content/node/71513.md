  (or similar)\r\n\r\nIt came with lots of alternate characters; for example, if the
  word began AW, the first stroke of the A would be vertical, the second slanting
  so that the W would have 2 diagonal end strokes.  OR, the first stroke of the W
  would be vertical so the second stroke of the A would be vertical and the first
  stroke diagonal.\r\n\r\nI've not explained that very well have I?!\r\n\r\nAny help
  gratefull received\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nHelen"
