    Type Company for the invitation. Some basic info:\r\n\r\nThe workshop is split
    in two parts; the first providing basic methodology and theoretical knowledge
    about typeface design techniques and best practices, and the second focusing more
    on advanced techniques for typeface design and post-production of font families.
