  body: Agree with Renko. Looks like they started from Helvetica Neue Bold and customized
    /a to make a single storey /a (original /a spur looks to have been kept, better
    look [[http://www.camdenartscentre.org/assets/layout/logo.png|here]]). A better
    way would probably be to switch for [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/helveticatextbook-bold|Helvetica
    Textbook Bold]] to get such a single storey /a.
