body: Hello, <BR> <BR>First, thanks for people&#39;s comments in my previous post
  concerning business cards. <BR> <BR>I will be getting business cards &#40;well,
  actually calling cards&#41; made up. For a simple straightforward design such as
  &#34;Daniel Ocean&#39;s&#34; calling card &#40;see screengrabs courtesy of James
  on thread 01/24/05 6:15 P.M.&#41;, would an online vendor serve just as well as
  a local vendor? Would a quality online vendor possibly be cheaper? &#40;I live in
  NJ/NYC area and the only vendor I&#39;ve been to so far has been Crane&#39;s, the
  stationery store.&#41; <BR> <BR>I want everything to be exactly the same except
  of course for the name. Comments? Suggestions? Recommendations? <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks!
  <BR> <BR>Karl

    Brunswick area, if that&#39;s close for you.
