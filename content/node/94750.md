  body: "I assume the angular parts on some letters' curves are just artifacts due
    to image enlargement and I suspect also that the initial |O| belongs to a different
    font (it's much thinner).\r\nBased on that I suggest to use <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-2&ffam=Swatch%20it%20-%20Regular&fstyle=&fsize=60&fid=94e33f36470650aedcd04eb2f61946aa&wrap=2&text=Our%20common%20future|Swatch
    it]]</strong> by Samuel Park (free for personal use) and find an appropriate capital
    |O| from another font.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI
    found it using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com"
