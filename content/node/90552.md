body: "Last week I had a good apatite for writing and I added three entries to my
  blog [[http://arabictype.wordpress.com | ArabicType]].\r\n\r\nOne was about Arabic
  support on the Samsung Galaxy Tab v10.1. The machine had a beautiful Arabic font
  which it beautifully rendered on its screen. It really assured me that there are
  huge possibilities in designing Arabic fonts that would render on screens much better
  than what Windows already provides.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/blogontab_6263.jpg]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nAnother
  entry was an article on a Jordanian typographer and calligrapher, Hussain Al-Azaat.
  The man has got talent, and I showed some of his work on my blog.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/azaathooroofiya_4043.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  third blog entry was about an Iranian typographer, Dariush Mukhtari, which came
  up along my googling \"Shahnama\", the \"Book of Kings\", which Sheila Blair referred
  to in her book, Islamic Calligraphy. Mukhtari has made his own book of kings by
  drawing Persian kings (and other subjects) from logos made of letters. I am not
  sure whether he draws by hand or uses a program to construct his images.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aho-shahnama_5349.jpg]"
