		<div class="commentbody">Richard is right that good spacing reduces kerning. But it's also very true that many designers (especially &quot;anglos&quot;) don't pay kerning its due respect. <BR> <BR>ville/Helle, <BR>It's possible to write a book on your question! And such a book might contain as many questions as answers&hellip; But: <BR> <BR>If you're starting from scratch, make two lists, one that contains right-hand &quot;exceptions&quot; and one that contains left-hand. An exception is a character (or actually a glyph) whose profile (left or right) is irregular beyond a certain threshold. For example, the right side of the lc &quot;t&quot; is almost always an exception; while the left side of the lc &quot;a&quot; is *sometimes* an exception (think of designs like those of Gudrun Zapf von Hesse). The threshold depends a lot on the level of quality you want, in terms of the number of pairs you'll end up with. After you have the two lists, match up each right-exception member with all the left-exception members, and for each pair decide how much (if any) adjustment is needed. <BR> <BR>To me this is the ideal method if you make few fonts. But if you make a living in type design, it's more cost-effective to make a list of pairs (or get one from an expert - just make sure he/she is *really* good) and just check those. But  if you do that you always have to stay on your toes - lest you miss something parrticular to the design at hand. <BR> <BR>Also note that pairs aren't enough by themselves. Since we generally read word shapes (not individual letters) it's important to test words, of course. But that's a different book. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, that's a great page - I'd forgotten about that. <BR> <BR>The only thing that bugs me about it is its heavy reliance on control strings. They're certainly a great basic tool (I use them a lot, just like everybody else), but they do contain a danger: real language is not &quot;ooonoonononnonnn&quot;, and sometimes control strings mislead. The best example I can think of is the letter &quot;oh&quot;: if you look at a well-spaced font you'll notice that its sidebearings are much tighter than a control-string method would generate, and the designer has compensated for the method's shortfall &quot;manually&quot;, probably by just going in and tightening all the round characters after having done the control-string method. (The reason rounds need to be tighter is simply because round-round adjacency is rare in actual language). Another example is the most common English word, &quot;the&quot;: when you rely exclusively on control strings it doesn't come out very nice. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hold everything. What I'm talking about is not &quot;professional&quot; at all - maybe it could be called &quot;academic&quot;. In fact it's a waste of time if you're trying to make as much money as possible. But I'd like to think that there are better reasons to design type, or at least to attain a level of quality irrespective of finances. <BR> <BR>From what I can tell most people use variations/extensions of Tracy's system, which is indeed based on control strings. But even as Tracy states, the eye is the &quot;final arbiter&quot;, which means it's not &quot;illegal&quot; to make the &quot;o&quot; tighter for example. But the eye cannot know linguistics - the *mind* has to help advance the quality of the spacing beyond merely control strings + guesswork. <BR> <BR>The way I do my own spacing is actually a diluted version of my &quot;ideal&quot; method, but I think it's still more demanding than what the average designer does. <BR> <BR>I do the base spacing with control strings pretty much in the Tracy way, but then I tighten the round sidebearings, and apply certain other adjustements (like loosen the lc &quot;el&quot; - to give it more presence in a word - set the word &quot;million&quot; to see), then I test with the most frequent digraphs and trigraphs, then I test with the most frequent English words (I should do more than English, but&hellip;), then I test with a list of rare but &quot;problematic&quot; words. Linguistics also applies in kerning, simply because some pairs are more important than others. That's the gist of it - and I'm really not too happy with it - because I have dreams of what spacing *could* be&hellip; <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
