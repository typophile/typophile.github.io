  (Escola Superior de Artes e Design) in Porto, Portugal. The theme of the project
  is Italian Graphics during the period between 1930 and 1960. I need your help to
  try to identify some of the typefaces used in some of the publications (see attachments)
  that were printed at the time. Many thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nRicardo
