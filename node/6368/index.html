  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So the other day I bought this monolithic pine chest with a 3x3 arrangement of hefty drawers for $10, sanded off the [disgustingly thick] varnish and stain &#40;man, was that a chore, even with a belt sander&#41;, and now I have a blank canvas so to speak. I&#39;ve bought a nice reddish wood stain &#40;and a matte varnish&#41; for it, but I&#39;d like to do something more than just restain it all one color. But I don&#39;t want to make it a freaky piece that can only be appreciated by a... freak. Any ideas? FYI, the dimensions in feet are about 3H x 6W x 2D, and it has a nice paneled top &#40;like old wooden floors had&#41;. It was built on June 16, 1978, which is two days before I turned 10. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, straining pine nicely actually has pretty demanding preparation.  <BR> <BR>If you just slap the stain on it will be splotchy and have an unnatural looking &#39;zebra&#39; effect as well. Really quite ugly and very disappointing. To get a nice result you need to hand sand down with progressively finer sand paper, to avoid the splotchiness. Then you need to first put on a pre-treatment - do they call it &#39;conditioner&#39; - that soaks in an prevents the stain from being too different on the summer and winter wood and getting the zebra effect. Then when you stain it will get a lovely natural look with the glow of the deeper color. <BR> <BR>Get a book on it for the details. <BR> <BR>This is enough bother and the result lovely enough that you may not want to do more.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Hrant, I remember I used to take a cinder block and roll it all arount the piece of furniture to it give scratches and dents for character. Then after staining and applying the finish I would rub black bee&#39;s wax with a cloth all-over, this would fill in all the &#34;inperfections&#34; with the wax and make it look aged. Than after a while just buff the surface so it will get an nice sheen. I was also told shoe polish is a good substitute. <BR> <BR>Sometimes I like to use crackling medium on furniture. Once dry, you can apply black wax to fill in the gaps then wipe the excess off with a clean rag. <BR> <BR>IM</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You can always paint over it, as long as you use the compatible paint - oil or water based, as the case may be. I don&#39;t remember about oil vs. water based stains. The main thing is that the varnish will have to be compatible with the undercoat. The conditioner thing &#40;if I remember the name right&#41; is specifically for pine. As it is a soft wood, pine really sponges up the stain, which is why it is tricky to stain. The conditioner pre-soaks it somewhat, so you don&#39;t get such a stark contrast.  <BR> <BR>If you do decide to go the stain route, try the process first on a raw wood pine board, so you will have an idea about the result, and whether you like it. Once you stain if you don&#39;t like it you can only paint it over or resand. The staining and varnishing is really simple - the headache is preparation   <BR> <BR>I took the trouble to look into this stuff when I stained some window frames and a door, as I knew I&#39;d have to live with it for a long time. Doing it right really did make a huge difference. Now when I see pine stained wrong -blotchy, streaked - it screams out at me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Do I use some kind of watery glue?</i> <BR> <BR>Never having done decoupage, I&#39;m no expert. But for gluing paper, I always recommend YES! glue. Good stuff that doesn&#39;t wrinkle paper like Elmer&#39;s typically does. <BR> <BR><i>If I want to apply a translucent color on top, do I just use watered-down [water-based] paint?</i> <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t water it down. In my art school hay-days, I used to make my own acrylic paint with Rhoplex AC33 acrylic emulsion. You could add a small amount of store-bought acrylic paint into a base of AC33 for a translucent color. Or you can add raw pigment into AC33. <BR> <BR>This sort of thing can be done with matte medium or whatever, but I found AC33 to be a much better solution. <BR> <BR><i>So I tried the stain on part of it, and it came out as complete mierda ... I don&#39;t want to bother with a conditioner</i> <BR> <BR>Have you ever used sanding sealer? With some [softer] woods, it can help to give you a more even finish. This may be akin to what William refers to as a conditioner.  <BR> <BR>A side note: there are 2 additives that improve the brushability of paint. Floetrol for water-based &#40;latex&#41; and Penetrol for oil-based. I&#39;ve never used them in anything other than house-painting, but they may improve your surface somewhat. In house-painting they make a rolled surface looked professionally sprayed, and a brushed surfaced look rolled. They may well make a finger-painted surface looked brushed, but I&#39;ve never tried.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, I thought you said you weren&#39;t sure about the conditioner business? Anyway, I went to the store again and saw the conditioner/primer/sanding_sealer/whatever, and it sounds like it would help a lot. But the guy there said I should try something easier first&#42;: stain <i>gel</i>. Apparently it&#39;s something that sits on the surface more than being absorbed a lot, so the guy thought it&#39;s worth a shot. Anyway, I tried it a short while ago, and it certainly looks better than the regular stain I tried before, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s good enough. The conditioner might need to be called in after all. This is such a pain - it&#39;s making me nostalgic for the simple pleasures of power sanding... <BR> <BR>&#42; Because I don&#39;t think the conditioner would take &#34;two minutes&#34;, William. <BR> <BR>BTW, Nathan just gave me an idea: <BR>If I take like a reddish-brown paint, dilute it down and just paint that on, wouldn&#39;t it give color to the wood while still letting the grain show through? Some sort of faux stain thing? Maybe that&#39;s what that gel stuff is doing... <BR> <BR>One other thing: it would be really good if somebody found a typographic angle to this woodshop stuff - I feel pretty guilty!  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;William, I thought you said you weren&#39;t sure about the conditioner business? <BR> <BR>No, I was very clear about the need for pre treatment of pine and the need to read up on it and test before you actually do it. I just wasn&#39;t certain about the name - but my memory was correct. And yes, the pre-stain conditioner just takes minutes, because it just soaks in and that&#39;s it. There&#39;s no finess required. All the sanding takes time and care, but not this. The staining doesn&#39;t take that much time either. The sanding and then the final finishing take the time - if you want to do a classic type of finish.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Despite the fact that I used to get messy with a bunch of emulsions &amp; dispersions in school, I&#39;m no master of the chemistry behind these things. That said however, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d try this: <BR> <BR><i>If I take like a reddish-brown paint, dilute it down and just paint that on</i> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m pretty sure that the pigments in stain are different than the pigments in paint -- perhaps more importantly, I believe the suspension of the pigments in solution is of a different nature. And it collects in the grain of the wood quite differently. Stain brings out the wood grain,while paint obscures it. <BR> <BR>That said, if you want to use paint, make sure you use <i>transparent</i> red. E.g., Alizarin Crimson is transparent, while Cadmium Red is opaque. I think that Alizarin will let the grain show through, while Cadmium may not.</div>
