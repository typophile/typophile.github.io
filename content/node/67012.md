body: "Dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI came up with an idea that I want to share with everyone
  here including the moderators. Sorry if this subject was already discussed in some
  post, but I can't recall such post...\r\n\r\nAlmost every day there are people here
  that post some request for help to start a paper/thesis on a subject for purpose
  of academic studies. And everyone tries to help put some info about it. A site,
  an article, book or even films... Usually these request for help results in a very
  good starting point and lots of times people say that this article is good or did
  not know this book, etc...\r\n\r\nI do believe that the final result of some (all?)
  of these article/thesis are very interesting to read, but we don't have access to
  them (well at least in a fast and organized manner...).\r\n\r\nMy proposal is this:
  Why not create a digital library of these articles/thesis? I would love to have
  a very reliable place to get these articles/thesis well organized...and since they
  usually are academic studies that can be shared without infringements of copyright,
  no? I know that there are the language issues, but lots of them are English and
  typophile is the world :)\r\n\r\nI do believe that if we are interested and the
  persons that produce such article/thesis were interested they could share it.\r\n\r\nI
  would love to hear from the people what do you think about this.\r\nSorry if this
  is a little off topic or if such a think already exists...\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio Fonseca\r\n"

    around, and it certainly would be a very interesting experiment. However, as I
    understand, some universities limit the reproduction of thesis for masters and
    doctorate degrees within itself, or are otherwise only accessible in specific
    places where copies may be bought, such as in the National Library here in Portugal.\r\nAt
    least, I believe it works that way."

  body: "I know many grad students are allowed to disseminate their research, and
    in many cases it is a requirement. I think the idea of having a library section
    here at Typophile would be great. To make it even more useful, from the educational
    viewpoint, the submissions should be peer reviewed. Volunteers would read papers
    (I would be happy to volunteer) and if three, or five, peers approve of a paper,
    it could be <em>published</em> to the library.\r\n\r\nPeer volunteers could be
    limited to people with two or three years activity at typophile, and at least
    10 years graphic design experience.\r\n\r\nAny other ideas?"

    My goal was to get a more specific/easy/small library...\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"
