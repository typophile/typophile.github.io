  idea is to let them make a calendar for the new year. In order not to end up with
  the usual suspects, I need to find some great inspiration. So my question to you
  is: Do you know any great websites where I can find some crazy / weird / unusual
  / exciting or just plain beautiful calendars? Thanks for the help!'
