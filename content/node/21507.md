  appear in the forum, although they do show up on the home page. Please hang tight
  while this is being looked into -- normal service will resume shortly.

  body: "hmm, posted a thread \"Euro sign problems in Quark\" an hour or so ago and
    it doesn't seem to show up anywhere apart from via the front page \r\n\r\n(eg
    it's not there in my \"track recent posts\" view or through the default forum
    > general discussions view). \r\n\r\nactually, is the default forum view broken
    as it only seems to show one last reply within the last 15 hours?\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/21509"
