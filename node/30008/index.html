<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>During Dadaism, what kind of typography was used? I know for a fact that because of the war, everyone was very much against it and started desining outrageous things so does that mean that san serif came to be when designers took off the serifs of Roman influenced lettering? Is that the cause of it and is that how Bauhaus took san serif a step further? where does slab serif come into all this though? And during the 20th century, we see a variety of movements fron Art Deco to Art Noveau to the hippy 70's style type. Is this because society's attitudes changed towards lifestyles etc that everything stated having 'styles-movements' to them? Is it because people wanted to see new innovative things that made designers experiment more with type? what is your theory? </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Marcel Duchamp said "The only thing worse than a serif typeface is a sans-serif typeface," and invented Dingbats as a reaction to what he called "the tyranny of the alphabet." Other Dadaists, perhaps misinterpreting his comment, strived to create faces that were neither serif nor sans-serif, and among the styles to arise from these efforts were slabs and flares. This is recounted on p216 of <em>I Did Seek The Serif</em> by Egbert Gebbinforte, Harper-Mifflin Books, 1998.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sans serifs and slab serifs pre-dated Dada by almost 100 years.
It is dangerous to make sweeping statements like everyone was against the war so they started designing outrageous things, however I think you can safely say that most of the world were indifferent, if they weren't vehemently opposed, to Dada typography.

<div class=commentbody>Sans-serif type got respect after Dada, not from it. Dada (along with other things) made rule-breaking much more acceptable (at least in the art world), and probably inspired some of the appearance of sans type in areas other than the commercial jobs where it was seen before. But what really brought out sans type was the work done at the Meisterschule and the Bauhaus, which became an international phenomenon after the publication of Tschichold's <em>The New Typography</em>.
Style movements are related to the attitudes and needs of a society, and as we understand them they are constructs of historians who create terminology that eases discussion. It's important to keep that in mind because there are a lot of styles that get lumped together (ie. arts and crafts, art nouveau, and jungendstil) and in-between periods that get lost in the cracks. Going much deeper than that is the sort of thing that could fill up an entire graduate education. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I am still incredulous and very skeptical that these (anti)artists actually randomly chose the word dada. But that's just me. That there was a Dada exhibit in Paris and NYC goes against the grain of the spirit of Dada. But even this is too codifying for a process that attempted to take the rug out of the rug that someone is standing on.
So to ask what typefaces the Dada people used is absolutely absurd (but not absurd like the dada way, whatever that may be).</div>

<div class=commentbody>In 1969 I won the Art prize at school. The arrangement was that you went to the bookstore and chose the book you'd like, and then it was delivered to the school, who put the appropriate label in it, and stamped the school crest on the cover in gold foil. This was thought out in the days when cloth covers were the norm, so it was a shock at first to receive my prize from the headmaster and see the crest disrespectfully slapped onto the Hans Arp work shown on the cover. But really, was that brilliant or what?!

<div class=commentbody>Kurt Schwitters also designed a 'Systemschrift' (a typeface designed in a systematic way as to represent sounds) in three different variants, but it was never produced as a typeface then. Schwitters just used it in some of his posters and he published an article in the Dutch avantgarde magazine 'i10' about his proposal of this typeface.
The article (with some illustrations of his proposal for this typeface) is reprinted in Kurt  Schwitters: Das literarische Werk. Book 5 ('Manifeste und kritische Prosa') edited by Friedhelm Lach. (1998) Köln. DuMont Verlag
(unfortunately only in German)
One of the three variants of his Systemschrift was published as a digital typeface by The Foundry several years ago. You can find it on:
http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk
Go to 'Foundry typefaces' and to 'Architype collection 2'
One of Schwitters theories for his typeface was that since vowels are pronounced longer and stronger than consonants the letters for vowels should be broader and bolder than the letters for consonants. Also the vouwels are therefore round and the consonants are (rect)angular.

<div class=commentbody><strong>I visited the André Breton exhibition at Centre Georges Pompidou in ’91. At heart never a big fan of his grand pretensions I still spent three or more hours there. Just before I left I heard an infant in a perambulator loudly say <em>DADA!</em> I remember I found it refreshing.</strong>

<div class=commentbody>According to my Enciclopedia dell'Arte Garzanti the term Dada was adopted randomly maybe by someone looking through a French dictionary (the expression Dada is used for "toy"). Tzara said: Dada doesn't mean anything, it's a product of the mouth".</div>

<div class=commentbody><strong>I vaguely recall Hugo Ball explaining it in his autobiography <em>Flight out of time</em> as a name chosen by himself and Richard Huelsenbeck when they were looking for a stage name for a primadonna at the Cabaret Voltaire. Tzara, brilliant as he was, pretty much hijacked it and claimed it was his own discovery, to the others dismay. What the actual truth behind it all is I have no clue. Personally I don't think it matters much where it came from or who 'invented' it.</strong>

<div class=commentbody>One of my fondest memories of design school at Carnegie Mellon was hearing Dick Beaman, my art history professor, recite by heart (and with great gusto) a DaDa poem in a lecture hall filled with 19 year olds. Dick was a grey-haired man with middle aged paunch and looked more like an accountant than a painter. He had a very subtle humor which took some time to sink in for most students. His loud, screaming presentation of the DaDa poem well exceeded his usual mild inflectioned presentation. At that moment, all who had yet to "get him" quickly "got him".
