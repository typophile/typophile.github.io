body: "Hey there!\r\n\r\nI'm working on an article for my company's blog on typography
  and classification systems, and wanted to hear from some typographers and hear their
  take on it.\r\n\r\nWithout showing you the entire thing before launch (as it's a
  beast), I am arguing the idea that typefaces can't be classified, as their morphological
  properties are too close to each other. I go into the argument that as designers
  (that's my background - mainly web design, so shoot me) it saves us time, and I
  go into what different classes are good for.\r\n\r\nEssentially, I propose a completely
  new classification system named after my company \"The Phuse\". So, it would be
  idiotic for me not to weigh in the opinions of the type community. What am I hoping
  to get from here? Hoping not to be flamed, but hopefully to get some constructive
  criticism on how it can be improved (e.g. classes that should be removed, added,
  changed).\r\n\r\nWithout further adieu, here are the classes that I am proposing:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Serif\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Slab-serif</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Sans-serif</li>\r\n\t<li>Display\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Blackletter</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Comic</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Dingbats</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Handwritten</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Monospaced</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Pixel</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Script</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance! I'm hoping to launch the post early next week and align it with some
  other events, and offer some prizes to readers. The article will explain each class,
  show it's distinctions, etc.\r\n\r\n-- James\r\n\r\n<strong>Edit:</strong> I'd like
  to propose that I refer to this classification hierarchy I've created as a taxonomy,
  and I will refer to the two branches (broad and narrow) as <em>genus</em> and <em>species</em>,
  accordingly (as a little joke and stab to the scientific community, and to seem
  a little more professional)."

    example \xABpixel\xBB is not by any means a subcategory of \xABdisplay\xBB. There

    on a different \xABaxis\xBB so to speak (maybe in terms of what letters are \xABmade

  body: "James: <em>[...] I am arguing the idea that typefaces can\u2019t be classified,
    as their morphological properties are too close to each other [...]</em>\r\n\r\nExtrapolating
    this statement, there is basically no need to design type any further, because
    it all looks the same. Classification on <em>contrast sort</em>, <em>contrast
    flow</em> and <em>contrast</em> (Noordzij) or on characteristics (Vox) or on style
    periods (which I tend to do in combination with a classification on proportions,
    plus Noordzij\u2019s classification) is according to your statement also obsolete.
    \r\n\r\nIf I understand your approach correctly, according to the logics of your
    classification there are no display versions of <em>serif</em> or <em>slab serif</em>
    or <em>sans serif</em> typefaces and for instance monospaced typefaces cannot
    contain serifs or the lack of serifs. \r\n\r\nSo, let\u2019s focus on your classification
    on serifs and add some info:\r\n\r\n&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Serif</strong>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Translation
    (broad nib):\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;<em>Italian Renaissance</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;<em>French
    Renaissance</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;<em>Baroque</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;<em>Eclecticism*</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Hybrid
    (broad nib and pointed pen):\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;<em>Rococo
    (style galant)</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;<em>Eclecticism*</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Expansion
    (pointed pen):\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;<em>Classicism</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;<em>Romantic</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;<em>Eclecticism*</em>\r\n\r\n(*
    Eclecticism is my naming for the current style period)\r\n\r\nThe classification
    above is a gross simplification still, because the proportions of for instance
    the Italian Renaissance typefaces by Nicolas Jenson and Francesco Griffo are quite
    different. One could argue, as you do, that \u2018[...] as designers [...] it
    [a simplified classification &ndash;FEB] saves us time [...]\u2019, but one can
    also argue the knowledge and capacities of any designer who does not know the
    background and (the origin of) the details of the elements he or she is applying.
    \r\n\r\nRecently I asked a colleague-lecturer, who is well known for her \u2018modern\u2019
    designs, why she was mixing (revivals of) historical typefaces in her \u2018modern\u2019
    designs and she actually did not have any knowledge of (the expressions of) the
    style periods she was combining. Luckily for her, her audience does not have a
    clue either."

  body: "Nina: <em>What I meant with [...] was not supposed to relate to pen construction
    [...] as much as to the differing underlying architecture / \xABskeleton\xBB forms
    of the letters [...]\r\n\r\nAlthough details may differ (variants are easy to
    make with a pen), in my opinion the underlying construction <strong>is</strong>
    the pen construction. These letters find their form in the broad nib and although
    a \u2018skeleton\u2019 line can be derived for further processing, like adding
    \u2018expansion\u2019 (which happened in the 18th century), these letters were
    originally not written as a skeleton line. I show some examples of this theory
    in the PDFs which come with LeMo. \r\n\r\nThe majuscules that accompany the \u2018Gothic\u2019
    minuscules find their origin in the Uncials, and although these developed from
    capitals, they clearly form a different group. As you probably know, the round
    \u2018r\u2019 finds its origin in (the right part of) an OR ligature, which was
    separated eventually and was used only after a letter which was originally round,
    like an \u2018o\u2019.\r\n\r\nJust to illustrate how much details can differ per
    scribe, I show below two scans from my collection of photo\u2019s of mediaeval
    hands (from the Museum Meermanno in The Hague). Both are Dutch and date from the
    15th century.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<em>Christian, thank you very much for your

    others stating that the eras of two typefaces used in a piece are completely different
    and shouldn\u2019t be used together.</em>\r\n\r\nThe different style periods can
    be identified by for instance architecture, sculptures, paintings, music, cars,
    clothes... and by type and typography. One only knows one\u2019s position in time
    by having some knowledge of history. Lots of things which are presented as \u2018new\u2019
    nowadays have been done in some way or another in the past, but it is easy and
    often much more convenient to simply ignore this fact. \r\n\r\nThe 21th century
    typographer can make use (with or without being aware of this fact) of typefaces
    which origin date back to the Italian Renaissance (like for instance <em>Bembo</em>)
    or even further back in history. Until roughly the end of the 19th century the
    typography of every style period was dominated by its own typefaces. The revivals
    of historical typefaces have made access to and use of historical material to
    a commonly accepted practice in our time. Also in the world of music there is
    more access to historical (\u2018classical\u2019) music than there has ever been
    before. Still most of my students of the Royal Academy in The Hague consider the
    music by for instance George Frideric Handel (1685&ndash;1759) as something really
    from the past, but have no problems at all with using the revivals based on work
    by William Caslon (1692&ndash;1766). This difference in appreciation is in my
    opinion not a matter of taste, but of conditioning.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that
    you distilled the second half of your conclusion from my statement concerning
    a fellow lecturer, who \u2018did not have any knowledge of (the expressions of)
    the style periods she was combining\u2019. My point is not that one should not
    combine typefaces from different style periods (this inevitable in an eclectic
    era anyway, I reckon), but that a professional designer should have a thorough
    knowledge of the ingredients he/she is using. That knowledge sets the professional
    apart from the amateur, who has access to the same base material, i.e., fonts
    and software.\r\n\r\nCompare this with cooking: by definition this is just combining
    ingredients, but a michelin star chef will know the details and secrets of the
    ingredients and will use this knowledge to come to unique recipes/dishes. Refinement
    and sophistication require a solid basis after all.\r\n"
