  body: Thanks! That helps a lot. Is this a different version of Revue though that
    was available then or was it simply modified because the defining Revue characteristics
    to me are the breaks on the B A P and R and the dips below baseline. Also the
    E here is wholly different. Were these simply alternates or a different foundry/knock
    off. Does anyone know?
