  <BR> <BR>Apple will make a 70p donation to Band Aid 20 every time the singe is downloaded
  &#40;price of single from the store = 79p&#41;. <BR> <BR>One more reason that I&#39;m
  happy to be an Apple customer.

    have to torture yourself with that song.

  body: Well, I was thinking about the matching funds that Apple will send when I
    posted this link, and how much that donoation from Apple will probably amount
    to. Then I wondered about how much money other hardware/software/online music
    sellers will be sending... and came to the conclusion &#34;good for Apple.&#34;

    is apple really putting into this? Bandaid gives them an MP3, they add it to the
    database. ;o&#41;

  body: Hmm. Can&#39;t seem to find it on ITunes USA ... I haven&#39;t heard the new
    version, but I can&#39;t imagine it being as good as the first. I remember clearly
    the day that was released. I think my friends and I wore mine out on our record
    player from listening to the B-side too many times. <BR> <BR>=^P

    This Christmas time&#34; lyrics. <BR> <BR>What do they mean &#39;this time&#39;?
    Has it &#42;ever&#42; snowed in the southern hemisphere in the desert during December?

    just south of the equator - so my guess is that technically there will be snow
    in Africa this christmas time.

    <BR>what news! <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t the proceeds to to Sudan this time instead of
    Ethiopia? <BR> <BR>Darrell, it seems that you really, really, really don&#39;t
    like this song! Its only bubblegum... it isn&#39;t going to bring about the downfall
    of English society or anything... <BR> <BR>Here in Germany, we were subjected
    to this song last Christmas. One of the TV stations rounded up all of the &#40;at-the-moment&#41;
    famous teeny German pop stars to sing it &#40;in English&#41;. It was played non-stop,
    but I don&#39;t know what charities were involved. I wonder if the new, new version
    will makes it&#39;s way across the channel, to barrage us one more time. I&#39;m
    thinking yes...

    songs on it these days anyways.'
