  used as the primary body copy font? I tried Frutiger, but it doesn't quite look
  right. Today Sans?\r\n"

  body: "In general I'd stay away from anything over-technical. Mrs. Eaves is a sharp,
    crisp version of Baskerville. If you use something too cold the page will lie
    flat. IMHO\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Your link to \"National\" is a new one to me, I'll put it on my list. Having
    given it a look-over, maybe I'll try pairing with FF Meta and see how that looks.
    Or RR Glasgow is another one I really like. I think both have a feminine feel
    that might work well with Mrs Eaves? (latter btw is client choice, I can't change
    it)\r\n"

  body: Try Monotype grotesque. I find that it has some hideous properties that make
    it a great pair for a serif with a lot of personality.

  body: I think Today Sans is a better choice than National or Meta which are much
    more condensed in feeling than Mrs. Eaves. I paired her once with Geometric 415
    which worked well too. I kind of think you want a font with a round o.

  body: "Now we're talking--I really like the BT Geo 415 suggestion (i.e., Dwiggins'
    Metro) in its Black and Light Italic weights, this will work swell. I'd try the
    MT Grotesque suggestion but I don't have it. Geo and Mrs Eaves it is.\r\n"
