body: "I am looking for some font to start with or some great type treatments that
  you would consider sharp, like James Bond sharp with some Bruce Wayne exclusiveness
  and a bit of comedic twist thrown in like Ewan McGregor from the Down With Love
  movie.\r\n\r\nSome examples of type with interesting treatments (logos, mast-heads,
  etc.) would be awesome to start inspring new ideas from.\r\n\r\nI think some good
  font examples would be extremely helpful, though I don't think a font alone would
  do it. I could be up for some custom type/logotype if someone needs web services
  in return but I am not sure exactly what I am looking for yet.\r\n\r\nAnd to top
  it off, I would love most of all for it to have an interesting/modern black letter
  look to it. But this is not yet a requirement, just a dream.\r\n\r\nThis is for
  my personal logo which I always seem lost on. Any help would be greatly appreciated
  of course, and I will post any examples I can find of what I am talking about. I
  will probably be looking for examples over the next couple of months. But if i can
  find something quickly that would be wonderful."
