  have similarities, but I don't know if they're related:\r\n\r\nhttps://webspace.princeton.edu/users/klash/public/f1.JPG\r\n\r\nhttps://webspace.princeton.edu/users/klash/public/f2.JPG\r\n\r\n(In

  body: The first one is an old ATF face called Canterbury. I have a version with
    swash caps called Londonderry Air NF, and I believe Red Rooster has a version
    with regular caps under the original name.

    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/novella/\r\n\r\nAll the rest are the usual
    pirate font sites, worse (IMO) than the \"guilt by association\" Santa's Sleigh
    on dafont, downloaded 755,188 times.\r\n\r\nTake your pick."
