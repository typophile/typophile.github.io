body: "I was just starting a branding for a new client, I'm in the starting process
  and I really like the look of [[trajan]] for the logo type!\r\n\r\nI like the look
  and feel of trajan but I still can't get away from it reminding me of a movie poster!
  Does anyone have any other suggestions of a typeface that has a similar quality
  and style.\r\n\r\nI'm not ruling out trajan because its trajan, I'm just looking
  to explore a few more options!\r\n\r\nThanks, Rob"
