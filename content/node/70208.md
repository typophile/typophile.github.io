body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sirba_5_3467.jpg]\r\n\r\nSirba, a seriffed
  typeface family with a friendly personality, was conceived especially for the demands
  in complex text environments like dictionaries, academic texts annual reports, novels
  and magazines. It has many design features that were particularly designed with
  Sirba's purpose in mind. Because of its open counters, the large x-height, short
  ascenders and descenders, this typeface conveys a pleasant reading experience and
  high legibility even in small sizes. Sirba is a low-contrast typeface, contemporary
  but with a classical touch, revealing its beauty in design details, such as the
  asymmetrical bottom serifs, curved bracketing and calligraphically reminiscent terminals.
  Furthermore the capitals appear integrated into the text, thanks to the low cap
  height and the constant width of all tabular numbers between the weights make this
  typeface very usable in annual reports and tables.\r\n\r\nSirba is available in
  the four classic styles plus a special heavy (Black) version, which is particular
  in that its proportions are designed so the counters remain big enough when set
  in very small text sizes. This means that Sirba Black's spacing and letter width
  are rather generous in comparison to other typefaces of that colour. This ensure
  excellent legibility.\r\n\r\nDuring the design of the typeface family much attention
  was given to the italic and regular as counterparts of each other. The italic distinguishes
  itself just enough while reading without creating strange spots within the text
  when looking at the text as a whole.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://www.type-together.com/Sirba\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sirba_1_3732.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sirba_2_6495.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sirba_3_5844.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sirba_4_4676.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sirba_6_4910.jpg]"
