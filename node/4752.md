body: 'Hello community <BR>I started this logo two days ago and it is about a studio
  which sets up exhibition kiosks. They do both the design and the production and
  are neither the small office that will be eclectic and produce high quality design,
  nor the big one with mass production and low costs. Actually those are their competitors,
  so they are trying to define themselves among them. <BR>The most taugh task it&#39;s
  their name &#40;which is rather difficult and long -so not clear and easily eye-catching&#41;,
  so my efforts focused most at this point: it has to be the most legible it can be.
  At this direction the most effective solution  <BR>seemed to be the braking of the
  two consisting words of the name. <BR>Also if you have to recommend a subtitle &#40;like
  &#34;expo experts&#34; or smthng at this manner&#41; would be great. <BR> <BR>Thanks
  for reading, Have a nice day. <BR> <BR>christos  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35775.gif"

  body: D is alright but don&#39;t use any of those alternatives - placing words at
    90degrees for varying circumstances isin&#39;t a good strategy nor would I say
    breaking up the logo just to fit a panel. Changing the entire shape you&#39;ll
    have a hard time proving public recall - which is the point of a logo in the first
    place. If it was for wrapping paper fine, use angels but not when its going to
    be 6x2feet. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also liking B2. <BR>E and I are interesting and have
    potential I think. <BR>A I&#39;d throw out.

  body: For practical reasons I&#39;d agree with David, that &#34;D&#34; works well.
    Conceptually, however, I like the direction of C2 and the 3D graphic of E. Both
    of these need to be developed a little more, but I think both have good potential.
    <BR> <BR>Nice work. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

    <BR>I agree that this word is perhaps dependant upon reading it entirely and so
    to break it apart is probably not a good choice. So C2, while the most interesting
    shape, doesn&#39;t work &#40;well not completely. I&#39;m a rebel. What if ARCHI
    was the lighter weight typeface? Or can they overlap more or not touch?&#41;  <BR>
    <BR>For D, I&#39;m seeing Paula Scher &#40;not accusing you of anything, I&#39;m
    reading her book right now&#41;. What if the word never broke apart, but from
    use to use the bars could form different shapes? Or what if the could attach differently
    or even detach &#40;such as B1&#41;? <BR> <BR>I think my favorite is &#39;I&#39;
    ... so simple. The lines could perhaps be shades of the same color, they could
    move. I can even see motion and vibration happening &#40;kiosk tv display promo

  body: This is interesting. Logos are something I struggle with frequently--especially
    when dealing with service-based companies. These concepts are very nice, but none
    conjure up images of kiosk development or touch screens or whatever. Should this
    be a concern, or is this one of those cases where &#34;suggestion&#34; is as far
    as you can go? For example, what would separate this from a structural engineering
    firm? Just curious of what everyone&#39;s thoughts are &#40;especially you, Christos&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m drawn to C2 and E, and I like the flexibility of D. I would imagine
    that the panels in version E could fold and turn to create variations as well.
    C2 has great &#34;interaction.&#34; Great stuff. <BR> <BR>-Addison

  body: I would guess this is a niche audience so they get it no real explaination
    needed. I would opt for a KISS solution, don&#39;t over think this one.

  body: Sorry to get off on a tangent--I think some of these are appropriate, myself.
    I guess I was hoping to hear some of Christos&#39;s reasoning behind some of these
    concepts, or at least what sparked some of these directions.

  body: 'Hello everybody <BR> <BR>First of all thank you for the immediate feedback
    and the interest you all showed to the critic. <BR> <BR>I appologize for the delay
    of the response and i admit that the concept is not very clear. <BR> <BR>My main
    object -as i mentioned before-was to make this difficult name the most legible
    and i worked on it in this two directions: a/ to separate &#40;subtly but clear&#41;
    the two words that the name comes from and b/ to design a simple form which would
    work rather to support the legibility than to describe the occupation. Of cource
    the result has to have reference to the activity of the company but in a generic
    -and not descriptive- way. Now if this can happen in an intersting way &#40;as
    i believe happens in C2 and H&#41; that would be welcome.  <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s
    say the concept is immediate legibility &#40;imagine that the main exposition
    of the logo will be on trucks and while in traffic the &#34;audience&#34; has
    to &#34;catch&#34; the name in a very short time&#41;, plus anything &#34;intersting&#34;
    implies setting things in a space &#40;that&#39;s why D&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Also a
    bold solution &#40;G&#41; -showing that they are considerable competitor- and
    a sophisticated one &#40;I&#41; should be basic players of the team. <BR> <BR>Have
    a nice day <BR> <BR>christos'

    But you should definitely do something for the type...line height at least
