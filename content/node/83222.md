  book about the union of 2 Hebrew letters: aleph and lamed.\r\nI dont have any knowledge
  about the hebrew alphabet.\r\nWhat I want to know is:\r\nIs this used? I mean, the
  modern Hebrew typafaces consider a union of these 2 letters in one? Or its an error?\r\n\r\nSorry
  if any I made any mistake about this.\r\nThanks \r\nAntonio\r\n\r\nPS- If you have
  examples, please post."

    page in this chart of Hebrew vocalization and character forms used in manuscripts
    of Scripture:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/points_5903.gif]\r\n\r\nTwo
    forms of that ligature are the second and third items in the fourth column.\r\n\r\nIt
    isn't used in normal Hebrew text, like newspapers, but it is used in typefaces
    made recently simply because typefaces are still being made with features that
    permit them to be used for printing editions of the Masoretic text of the Scriptures,
    which contains this ligature and other exotic forms."

    your chart.\r\nIs it to much to ask if you can post the 2 letters and the ligature
    in good resolution, in order to get detail of the letters?\r\nThank again for
    the help.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

  body: "The history of this unique Hebrew ligature is fascinating. This form did
    not occur in classical (Biblical) Hebrew. It originated among sephardic Jews living
    in Arab lands, who spoke Arabic but wrote it with Hebrew letters. [This is typical
    of diaspora Jews, as also seen in Yiddish and Judeo-Spanish being written in Hebrew
    letters, although there are also examples of the reverse: Hebrew language written
    in Arabic letters, especially among the Karaites.] Now, the most common phoneme
    sequence in Arabic is AL, which is the definite article, and Jews began ligating
    the letters alef+lamed when writing this sequence. Initially, this form seems
    to have been reserved specifically for the definite article, but gradually became
    normal for every occurence of AL among Jewish Arabic speakers. The ligature made
    its way back into Hebrew via prayer books, in which Arabic speakers would transcribe
    the Hebrew prayers using their daily orthography, including this ligature.\r\n\r\nNote
    that this ligature is never used in the Bible text."

  body: "Does this ligature have anything to do with aleph-lamed being one of the
    names of God (and the issues surrounding erasure of the name)?  There are seven
    names in Hebrew, with the tetragrammaton being the most famous, but El (aleph-lamed)
    is another.  By using the ligature, one avoids explicitly writing a name of God.\r\n\r\nJust
    a thought from the Eastern European tradition, as I have no real exposure to Sephardic
    traditions."
