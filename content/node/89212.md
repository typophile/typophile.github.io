  I can't figure out the font that was the base for GLOBAL.\r\n\r\nI can redraw most
  of the characters by hand, the L and A definitely, the G and O moderately well,
  but I can't do the B...\r\n\r\nSo does anyone have an idea of something close to
  work from, or what it most likely started as?\r\n\r\nThank you!"
