  are concerned, I&#39;ve decided to have a go at making one. It&#39;s called Hawthorn;
  there is a regular U&amp;LC font and one with small caps instead. Crit? <BR> <BR><IMG

  body: ' Jack, <BR> <BR>If this is your first attempt, I&#39;d say you have an excellent
    specimen. I especially enjoy the small nuances like the lowercase &#34;l&#34;
    and the &#34;a&#34;. The lowercase and smallcap &#34;z&#34;, however, seem out
    of place, probably due to the rounded angles. &#40;I recognize the constraints
    you face when you get that small.&#41; <BR> <BR>What can you share about your
    design process? Did you build it directly in a bitmap editor or did you draw it
    pixel-for-pixel in Photoshop? <BR> <BR>jb '

  body: ' Mmm, you know, you&#39;re probably right about the Z&#39;s... I thought
    they seemed a little &#34;off&#34; while I was making them but I didn&#39;t think
    of any other way they could look. <BR> <BR>First step in the design process was
    Photoshop at 1600% zoom with a one-pixel pencil/eraser, for quick experimentation
    and such. Then in Fontographer I used the rectangle tool in conjunction with snap-to-grid
    to recreate the shapes as outlines. <BR> <BR>Designing this font, I am constantly
    beset with fear that I&#39;m unwittingly plagiarizing other people&#39;s work,
    but I suppose when one is designing a five-pixel high &#34;E&#34; there are only
    so many possibilities available. The one character I&#39;m fairly sure is unique
    is the lowercase Y; but maybe I just haven&#39;t done enough reading... <BR> <BR>And
    yes, this is the first &#34;draft&#34; of the typeface. '

  body: ' You&#39;ve nailed the small caps in relation to the the U&amp;lc. Many fonts
    out there use a &#39;unicase&#39; approach for variety &#40;including one of my
    own&#41;, whereas you&#39;ve created something much richer. <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t
    be concerned about the &#34;embarrassment of riches&#34; in terms the number of
    bitmap faces out there. The majority of them could only be called alphabets--with
    no attempt at serious punctuation, let alone international characters. Kudos for
    that. <BR> <BR>//joe '

  body: ' Really nice work! <BR>I&#39;d like to see how this would look as a normal
    face &#40;full size scaleable&#41;. It sure looks handsome.  <BR> <BR>There was
    mentioned the smallcaps and lowercase &#39;z&#39; falling out in relation to the
    rest of the typeface, I have the same feeling towards the smallcaps and lowercase
    &#39;x&#39;. When looking at the &#39;x&#39; it seems too wide. <BR> <BR>It is
    by far a richer 8-bit character set i&#39;ve seen and looks promising. <BR> <BR>&#40;By
    the way..im new here and will watch out this space as I&#39;m working on several
    character sets myself and would like some constructive and qualified critique
    when I feel the time is right for it.&#41; <BR> <BR>Good luck!!! <BR> <BR>Yours,

  body: ' font looks great. i like the descending numerals. i would have to agree
    that the lc &#39;x&#39; looks too wide. it is also too bright compared to the
    other characters. a problem easily remedied by mixing some of the diagonal with
    a verticle pixel or two or three or four. '
