		<div class="commentbody">here's the deal. i didn't mean to sound like that was my web site. i didn't make it, and i don't know who did. i'm just a believer. my passion for hating comic sans is a healthy (i hope) blend of satire and frustration. i'm a design student, graduating in december, and i'm completely bewildered by other students who use it because it's &quot;cute&quot; or whatever reason they give. like, lewis, i think it's just an arbitrary decision on their part, as if typography is some kind of minor detail they slap on their project at the last minute. that offends me. here's a funny story from school: i was in the library looking for a specific book for my typography class and couldn't find it. i went to ask the person at the desk (ostensibly a librarian, but&hellip;) to help me find a book on typography. she said (and this is an exact quote), &quot;a book about typing? let's see&hellip;&quot;. typing? typography! gee my krug! anyway, like lewis' prof, i just get so tired of seeing it when there are so many other options.  a lot of my message also goes to the administartive offices at school. i don't know if they think we like it or what, but there are always notices and announcements on the bulletin boards set completely in comic sans, and sometimes they get fancy and go with corsiva. <BR>fonts i like? that's a huge can of worms, as you can imagine. my first love was univers (don't laugh) just because it's so simple and consistent through all of it's weights. i dig a lot of zuzana licko's stuff, and local heroes thirst have some cool stuff. btw, be on the lookout for ex-thirst designer patricking's new font next year. he gave me a sneak peek at it a while back. it's based on some herbert bayer sketches, so obviously it's going to be, y'know, bayerish, but i love it so far. also, some of the fonts i've seen in the critique boards here have blown me away. off the top of my head: review beta by jared benson and pill gothic by christian robetson. <BR>i feel like hrant with this ultra-long post. so bj, i hope you don't think i'm going to assassinate vince. i really am a nice guy. if you're ever in chicago i'll prove it. you can stay at my place if you need to (sorry, not in my bed. my wife has that spot), or i'll just make you some cinnamon rolls or something.</div>

Of course it is far from that, having been produced in and distributed by one of the largest corporations in the world. Run it through TTX and then tell me if you still think it is &quot;amateur&quot;. <BR> <BR>I'm not going to argue that what typeface people use to do their typography doesn't matter, because that is a naive and reductive argument. It matters certainly &ndash; up to a point. <BR> <BR>But really what this comes down to is a foolish exercise that doesn't accomplish anything. If you are motivated to spread the gospel of rational and diligent typography, then you should direct your efforts to something more constructive than deleting fonts on public computers. It's a childish, wannabe-guerilla, watered-down-Adbusters sort of thing to do.   <BR> <BR>Instead of wasting time with little web sites and clandestine font deleting, why not read some books and then discuss typography in a critical, engaged (and engaging) way? Then you can begin to form a plan of action for promoting typographic progress, right?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First, I take the 'ban comic sans' site for what it is,  <BR>humor. It's on the same order as poking fun at Hobo or  <BR>creating a mockumentary of Cooper Black. (Although,  <BR>using Connare's picture is in poor taste.) <BR> <BR>This isn't a question of whether Comic Sans has  <BR>integrity as a typeface. It's a commentary on fonts in the  <BR>hands of amateurs&ndash;students, professionals and lay  <BR>people alike. This problem isn't new either. How many  <BR>times have we seen Apple's Chicago in print (eww). <BR> <BR>Connare's own comments hit the nail on the  <BR>head&hellip; (The link I posted earlier was broken.) <BR>Read the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.asp?nid=2648" TARGET="_blank">article on Microsoft's Typography site</A>. <BR> <BR>And an excerpt: <BR> <BR>I have seen Comic Sans used well - Disney has used it in some advertising - and I have seen it used poorly - An English coach line uses Comic Sans as its logo font painted on the side in half meter lettering. I am too personally amused when I go to restaurants and have to read it off the menu. <BR> <BR>&ndash;Vincent Connare <BR> <BR>In the end, I agree with 'Your Mother.'

TYPOGRAPHY IS NOT ABOUT YOUR PRESENTATION ABOUT THE HISTORY OF SANS SERIFS. You are not seeing the forest for the trees.  <BR> <BR>And Hrant said: &quot;Come on, large corporation mess up typography all the time.&quot; <BR> <BR>Hrant, you missed my point. I was responding to the person who said Comic Sans was an AMATEUR font. It is as far from AMATEUR as you get. You may think the letters in the font are ugly, but that is another thing entirely. It was made by a guy who was PAID to DESIGN TYPE.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; most people at my school who  <BR>&gt; are clueless prefer comic sans,  <BR> <BR>Isn't being clueless subjective? How do you know that these people aren't trying to target an audience who might appreciate this typeface? It doesn't bother me personally that you do not like it, I just think your reasoning needs a little more work. <BR> <BR>&gt; i think because it's closer to  <BR>&gt; the beginning of the font menu.  <BR> <BR>I think this is an asinine reason. Do you really think people outside of &quot;the world of typography&quot; have no desire to make a statement or visually communicate to others? Isn't that a bit judgmental? <BR> <BR>&gt; so it's one amateur  <BR>&gt; font at a time. <BR> <BR>Another asinine remark. <BR> <BR>&gt; today my professor asked me to delete Comic Sans off of all the computers <BR> <BR>This is one solution to this &quot;supposed&quot; problem. But wouldn't a more appropriate solution be to simply educate the students about the typefaces which are not to be used (along with sound reasoning as to why). <BR> <BR>&gt; students who use it because it's &quot;cute&quot; <BR> <BR>But, if this is the reason they are using it, maybe they feel it communicates cute. Again, subjective. <BR> <BR>&gt; More interesting is the aviary connection: canard/mapgpie.  <BR> <BR>Really? :-D How bizarre. <BR> <BR>&gt; It's funny to think of Comic Sans as an &quot;amateur font&quot;&hellip; <BR>&gt; I'm not going to argue that what typeface people use&hellip; <BR>&gt; But really what this comes down to is a foolish exercise&hellip; <BR>&gt; Instead of wasting time with little web sites and clandestine font deleting&hellip; <BR> <BR>Well spoken. <BR> <BR>&gt; Anybody who strikes down ComicSans based on technical merit is a retard. <BR> <BR>:-D Totally agree. <BR> <BR>&gt; aesthetic/cultural <BR> <BR>What about the fact that this says a lot about the break-down (read: total failure) of the educational system. When I have taught typography/design classes I always give the students a week or two for experimentation. Then when they bring in roughs set in a typeface that is meant for the viewing on a computer, I show them and explain to them why their selection isn't sound. I have had a few students insist they chose the best face and to them I would smile and nod. I cannot design for them, I can only help in the process. It is, after all, their portfolio. <BR> <BR>&gt; no amount of discussing or proseletyzing <BR> <BR>This is sad, but true. <BR> <BR>&gt; but to other students and designers lack of effort and care when they use it <BR> <BR>For those that do choose poorly their typefaces, well it let's those of us that supposedly &quot;know&quot; what we are doing truly shine. (Tongue in cheek) Kinda separating the, ahem, men from the boys. <BR> <BR>&mdash; <BR> <BR>When I was in England, Vinnie actually showed me this site. He thought it was hilarious. He knows the font was developed for a children's computer application and it was never meant to be included in the font pack for the public. As Joe pointed out and I've experienced first hand, finding the typeface used in odd situations is a game for Vinnie. <BR> <BR>I think the ban should be on &quot;bad communication&quot; not the poor little unassuming typeface. Typography in the end isn't, as Yer Momma has stated, about the typeface. I think it does play a part. Certainly a typeface can communicate and imply many things. Comic sans is not, perhaps, the most appropriate choice for an airline company. <BR> <BR>I personally think more time should be spent educating ourselves and helping those that truly do want help. Not wasting energy and time on the details that really don't matter, such as banishing a typeface that doesn't need banishing. <BR> <BR>Maybe a bit wordy. In the end, it comes down to education and that makes me sad. Sad that instead of trying to educate we are simply becoming boring and dogmatic. Leave poor comic sans, and helvetica for that matter, alone.</div>

TYPOGRAPHY IS NOT ABOUT COMIC SANS. TYPOGRAPHY IS NOT ABOUT YOUR PRESENTATION ABOUT THE HISTORY OF SANS SERIFS. <BR> <BR>of course i don't think typography is about my piddly presentations, i was juxtaposing the passion some people have for learning as much as possible about type and others who couldn't care less about the difference between times new roman and helvetica. <BR> <BR>&gt;&gt;students who use it because it's &quot;cute&quot;  <BR> <BR>&gt;But, if this is the reason they are using it, maybe they feel it communicates cute. Again, subjective. <BR> <BR>again, my laziness. i forgot that you all haven't seen it in the contexts i reference. comic sans on a hip hop cd cover? i reckon not. i've inquired as to the use of this font during critiques, and generally the answer is, &quot;it's cute&quot;, or, &quot;i just thought it worked.&quot; so there really isn't any attempt to communicate any sort of feeling or vibe, it was just there. <BR> <BR>&gt;&gt;i think because it's closer to  <BR>&gt;&gt;the beginning of the font menu.  <BR> <BR>&gt;I think this is an asinine reason. Do you really think people outside of &quot;the world of typography&quot; have no desire to make a statement or visually communicate to others? Isn't that a bit judgmental?  <BR> <BR>i was referencing fellow students, not the public at large. recent sightings of projects using comic sans include the above mentioned hip hop cd cover, a menu for a fancy restaurant, as part of a personal logotype (hey, it's your logo), and as body copy in a magazine mock-up. appropriate? <BR> <BR>&gt;&gt;so it's one amateur  <BR>&gt;&gt;font at a time.  <BR> <BR>i admit, that was an asinine statement. can i use scoles' &quot;lack of sleep&quot; excuse? <BR> <BR>in the end, my fun little steam-letting-outing sticker game served as a poor introduction to people whose abilities and opinions i have come to respect as i've been perusing these boards. maybe the all powerful moderators can just delete this whole thing i can start again. <BR> <BR>tiffany - asinine? i haven't been called that in &hellip; well, at least a couple of days. but i agree with you anyway.</div>

I think I'll use it now: I  <BR>wrote the following on far too little sleep&hellip; <BR> <BR> <BR>There are a lot of assumptions being made as to why  <BR>the &quot;Ban Comic Sans&quot; campaign began. But the  <BR>website lists no reasons. No manifesto is posted.  <BR>So remember that most of what people here are  <BR>responding to is Isaac Stanfield's <I>interpretation</I> of  <BR>what the sticker campaign is about. <BR> <BR> <BR>That said, I'm learning a lot from this thread. <BR>Two things I do know: <BR> <BR> <BR>1.  If the creator of the campaign intended to <I>incite  <BR>dialog</I> about&hellip; <BR> <BR> a. the merits or demerits of Comic Sans <BR> b. misguided typeface selection, or <BR> c. what signs point to amateurish design <BR> <BR>&hellip;then he succeeded. He's definitely generated a <BR>discussion, and that is often the purpose of a  <BR>grassroots campaign. <BR> <BR>Mostly I just think it's funny. People who don't might  <BR>have a different sense of humor, but they also might <BR>be taking this far too seriously. <BR> <BR> <BR>2. A font's location in the font menu can have an  <BR>influence on the user's selection. I know it because <BR>I've seen it - more than once. People who don't care <BR>or are short on time, rush to the first font that agrees  <BR>with them. A font near the top of the menu has a <BR>good chance of getting picked. I'm not talking about  <BR>designers here, I'm talking about people who do not  <BR>earn a living using type. They are people with an  <BR>immediate need, whipping out a flyer or sign. Their <BR>contribution is still important - these people produce <BR>a pretty big part of what the world sees.</div>
