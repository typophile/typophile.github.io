  post is misplaced.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for an option in Adobe Acrobat Professional
  to make one book\r\nsubdivided in stapled sets.\r\nThis means that I have e.g. 10
  pdf documents which should be Combined as a Binder, BUT as chapters.\r\nHow can
  this be done?\r\n\r\nI'd be very happy with some tips to solve this issue or information
  where to obtain information about this.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\nBas Schouten"

    are a way of combining separate files (in various formats, including PDF) in a
    single entity.\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\nDavid"
