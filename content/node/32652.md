  3, now that it's been released. I was just going to ask when it was going to come
  out, and lo! there it is...\r\n\r\n(But first I have to get through the next couple
  weeks, which are quite crazy...)"

    you can't do better for 99 bucks unless you want to shell out for FontLab Studio.
    I have used all 3 software packages, Fontgrapher, Type Tool 2 and FontLab Studio,
    like them all but like especially the ease of use of Type Tool 2, now 3. I just
    got 3 about 1 hour ago but being so familiar with the 2 version should be easy.
    To start out download the manual, look through it. Don't know what you want do
    exactly but whatever, it is a very good product, especially as above note on Open
    Type."

  body: "What I want to do is design for myself one good, usable text face. That's
    all. I figured that would be as good a tool as any for a newbie like me. If I
    get really serious about it, some pro can take over my work and polish it up and
    make money off it. But for now, I just want a font to call my own. Been working
    on the pencil sketches for some time now. The next stage will be to recreate the
    pencil sketches on screen. I'm estimating probably 100-200 hours of work just
    doing that.\r\n"

    on my list too. I think it must be some designer 'must do before I die' mantra
    akin to a mountain climber tackling Everest or a Skiier doing the double black
    diamond moguls. ;o)\r\n\r\n"

  body: Actually for me a "good, usable text face" will always be a challenge which
    I might carry with me until I drop. But who knows, something might work which
    I will be happy with.

  body: Good and usable doesn't mean world-beating for me. Just something I can use
    and be somewhat proud to call my own. Maybe a single black-diamond run. ;-)
