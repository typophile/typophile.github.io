    any of you who feel \"left\" out by such placement, e.g. the key with the tilde

  body: "You are welcome, David! :-)\r\n\r\nThe best way to preview glyphs while editing
    outline would be to use neighbours while right or left glyph is the same as one
    that you are editing. Unfortunately that is not working - it does not update neighbours
    in this case. We will fix this bug in the next update. Until that you can still
    use Preview panel which has some nice features that Metrics window misses. Takes
    less screen space too."

  body: ">three screens \r\n\r\nYou can have many FontLab windows open on one screen,
    and I think almost everybody works this way. \r\n\r\nFor example right now for
    working on a bold I have four metrics windows open--regular and bold-in-progress
    of my font, a similar set from a font I like for comparison, all with the same
    string of characters that I am working on. \r\n\r\nPlus the preview window with
    the @ sign between control letters (the character you are working on substitutes
    for the @ sign). And then I open a window to work on the glyph, still seeing its
    effect between control characters in the preview window, even when it's relatively
    full screen. \r\n\r\nAnd I have a second screen with some tool pallets open. \r\n\r\nI
    think that's normal. I don't think I am particularly efficient, and I'm sure others
    have more clever working methods. I think it would be good to gather info on working
    methods. Maybe I should start a thread..."

  body: "Sounds good! \r\n\r\nOne thing I'd like to point out though, and I hate to
    seem like I'm trying to break the record for sounding like a broken record, but...The
    best way to preview glyphs while editing the outline should have two pair-o-modes;
    one where the user has turned off the nodes, in which case they should never appear,
    and one where the nodes are on, and they don't disappear. The other mode pair
    being that the contour should fill with and without showing itself. \r\n\r\nSo
    what's the broken record? FOG had this right. One turned off the nodes and could
    edit them \"sight unseen\", i.e. the nodes never appeared when \"turned off\"
    even when selected. Later, PvB's very first customization of FOG was a cmmd key
    to show a filled glyph in the glyph window. We felt this last little thing was
    the completion of a perfect letter drawing interface. \r\n\r\nWith the nodes hidden,
    a filled outline could be edited with the appearance of magic occurring \u2014
    the designer waving and clickin' around a glyph responding to seemingly invisible
    \"strings\". Cool as it was, it was also the most transparent and comforting method
    I ever used to draw and shape letters: seeing whatever visual crutches one needed,
    or none, with a single key while still being able to edit.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"
