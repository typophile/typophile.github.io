  typography. I write a lot for my job (something similar to a lawyer) and until now
  I've used folio. I'm getting a little bored with it so i'm looking for something
  new.\r\n\r\nI really love grotesk and I've maybe found some replacement for folio:
  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/supria-sans/|supria sans]], [[http://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/founders-grotesk/|klim's
  founders grotesk]] and of course basic commercial. \r\n\r\nI like a lot these fonts
  but I'm afraid they seems too much fancy, polished and refined for the every-day
  writing. \r\n\r\nyou agree? any \"plain\" grotesk to suggest?\r\n\r\nthanks. "

  body: "It's good you're moving away from Folio: besides being boring it's not particularly
    readable (although it's much better than Helvetica).\r\n\r\nI don't think those
    fonts you mention are too fancy. One thing you should keep in mind is that \"fancy\"
    details don't pop out at small (read: text) sizes - they just blend into a -hopefully-
    pleasant texture.\r\n\r\nAlso look at TypeTogether's library.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I'm not sure how Supria would work typeset for regular document styles. I've
    never set it that way, and it wouldn't have come to my mind. You'll have to try
    it out. \r\n\r\nNote that Chris Sowersby recently issues Founders Grot Text, as
    the original Founders was found to work poorly at small sizes.\r\n\r\nNational
    ( http://vllg.com/Klim/National#panel=about ) is a great option that I have found
    to work well at regular and smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nYou probably have specific requirements
    for the typesetting you are doing. Those requirements will help reduce your options!\r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: "thanks everybody. \r\n\r\nthe text version of founder grotesk seems fine,
    a little more streched out and larger than the other. I don't like national, altought
    they're very different it unacceptably reminds me calibri. \r\n\r\nI'll see how
    to spend this big money."
