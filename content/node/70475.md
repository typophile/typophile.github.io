  body: I'm completely no expert, especially about spacing and kerning, but it looks
    to me like you might be using kerning as a remedy for spacing that's not quite
    there yet. Pairs like r_l, i_s and t_h shouldn't normally require kerning.

  body: "Spacing and kerning are a disaster. I wonder, why you have doubts about the
    quality. It\u2019s extremely uneven. Why is there kerning between i and j for
    example? Why is there positive kerning between w and o and negative between r
    and m? Another example: It\u2019s and like. There is more space between the stems
    of I and t than between l and i. I and t is less critical in case of your font
    than t and h. While t and h may need more spacing, although the distance between
    the stems of t and h are the same as in i and h, the cross bar of the t is no
    reason for enlarging the distance between I and t.\r\n\r\nBy the way, it is better
    to kern in big point sizes with a big distance to the screen because of rounding
    imprecisions in FontLab. And kern words, but not whole sentences. You can use
    a free dictionary like the one, that OpenOffice uses, in FontLab. Try to create
    a list, in which you have an order of kerning/spacing, alphabetical like aa, ab,
    ac \u2026 or with regard to the forms ii/ij/hn, oo/oe/od, wo/we. (I prefer the
    alphabetical order.)\r\n\r\n1. There are too many kerning pairs.\r\n2. There are
    too many positive kerning pairs. In most well spaced fonts, that I have seen,
    positive kerning was the exception, but not the rule.\r\n\r\nCheck the following
    articles on \"http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/\":
    <em>Basic Character Spacing in Type Design</em> and <em>Rhythm in Type Design</em>\r\n\r\n<cite>Don\u2019t
    even think about kerning until the spacing is absolutely perfect.</cite>\r\n\r\nAbsolutely
    right. And not only with regard to the evenness, but also with regard to the general
    spacing.\r\n\r\n"

    I said in my previous message, I already saw some problematic situations and solve

    more and more irregularities).\r\n\r\n@ Arno:\r\n\r\nI can't agree with you completely,
    especially with 1) and 2).\r\n\r\nThere are total 1037 kerning pairs, partly cause
    there are 352 glyphs total in this font which is pretty OK number if you have
    in mind that some of well-know commercial fonts have more then 3000 pairs. I'm
    not saying that this font can't have less pairs, but that's what I was thinking
    in the first sentence of this post - as times goes by, everything will be more
    visible for me.\r\n\r\nAbout positive pairs... 10-15% of all pairs in this font
    have positive kerning, basically cause in small sizes in FL I noticed some irregularities.
    \r\n\r\nOf course I used spacing/kerning tests.\r\n\r\nAnd of course I have a
    list with problematic glyphs.\r\n\r\nBut, sometimes, math is not equal to eye.\r\n\r\n-
    - - -\r\n\r\nI hope (and I know :)) that things will come on it's place at the

    it's possible, but all good results require time.\r\n\r\n- Dusan"

  body: "@ tourdeforce\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to decide about the quality of kerning
    in low sizes on screen. You even have rounding errors in 72 pt (Points? I am not
    sure at the moment about the unit. I mean the size in FontLab).\r\n\r\nWhen I
    kern, I change the size frequently. And in the end I print the pairs (contained
    in words).\r\n\r\nI cannot really value all pairs in your examples, but only the
    extreme ones and primary in the bigger size.\r\n\r\nBut there were so many red
    marks (positive kerning indicators) \u2013 it looked as more than 15%. Round about
    50%.\r\n\r\n1037 pairs are indeed not necessarily too many, but there seemed to
    be many wrong ones. And again, whole sentences irritate my eyes. Single pairs
    also don\u2019t give a correct impression. The context is necessary, but words
    are enough for the kerning on screen (in my opinion). It\u2019s partly dependent
    from the screen size. On a small TFT I would search for words, that don\u2019t
    contain more than round about eight characters.\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready, you
    could provide a PDF with a list of words, in which all pairs are contained. That\u2019s
    better than screenshots.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think, that your font is relatively
    hard to kern, because it does not forgive mistakes. This is probably caused by
    the regularity of the shapes and the squareness. I generally don\u2019t get warm
    with the most sans serifs, especially not in big sizes. (I miss the serifs in
    big sizes more than in low sizes.)\r\n\r\nAnd you should know, that I am a pure
    amateur. When I am talking about letters, it is primary feeling, but not a long
    year experience. But I think, that I have a good feeling for spaces. Probably
    more than for the features of the shapes. Maybe not, I don\u2019t know. I often
    can\u2019t comprehend the opinions of the professionals here about some fonts.
    In my eyes many of the lauded fonts are oversharp or overdetailed. I don\u2019t
    like Maiola for example. But I extremely like Merlo. I like the Berthold Van Dijck
    more than the DTL Elzevir, because I can better read Van Dijck. This is partly
    caused by my printer, but probably not only. My eyes seem to draw lines in the
    reading process, if the shapes of glyphs are extremely sharp, especially when
    the irregularities are very limited in a font. Stempel Garamond is already a joy
    with my laser printer, but if it is printed more dirty and less sharp, I can better
    read it yet. What I want to say is, don\u2019t give too much on my critique."

  body: "Thanks Arno.\r\n\r\nThis is what I'll do \r\n\r\nI'll make two font files:\r\n\r\n1)
    one with existing spacing & kerning;\r\n2) one with new spacing & kerning;\r\n\r\nAnd
    let's see how things will work out.\r\nMy first aim is to have less kerning pairs
    and I think it's possible to go with less then 500 in this case. Second aim (first
    by importance) is to check spacing again and again and again. It simply require
    time to notice irregularities and like in book design, you see some typos after
    book is already printed, that's how it goes with font - it must sleep for a couple
    of days before I move on. It's pretty hard to see everything at once (at least
    for me).\r\n\r\nArno, no hard feelings, I really try to do good metrics for this
    font and reason why I started this topic is cause I wasn't so sure in what I done
    so far.\r\n\r\nHm.. I actually have an idea (which is probably already old, but
    whatever) about an additional way/help for doing metrics... I'm not good in scripting/coding,
    but idea is to do next:\r\n\r\nTo make software/script where you could define:\r\n\r\n-
    number of pixels that will be  between each glyph (for example, for all rounded
    glyphs volume between them would have e.g. 300px (300px as number of pixels that
    filled that space between them);\r\n\r\n- should have an fixed size in points
    - for example it only works in 36pt, actually it's where's pixel's size 1:1;\r\n\r\nJust
    an rough idea, there are questions what would happened with space between e.g.
    /C/ and /X/ when /C/ is open on the right side and /X/ on the left.\r\n\r\nJust
    a thought....\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@ tourdeforce\r\n\r\nYou think about an autospacing or autokerning script?
    There is one autokerning service (<a href=\"http://ikern.com/k1/\">iKern</a>)
    and the DTL KernMaster. You could ask Igino Marini, what he wants to have for
    spacing your font. He doesn\u2019t seem to have fixed prices. If it would be easy
    to write autospacing programs, that can compete with the human eye, there would
    be more of those programs.\r\n\r\nI wish iKern would be a program, for which you
    can purchase a license, although it probably cannot beat the human eye.\r\n\r\nEdited:\r\n\r\nThere
    was an online kerning/spacing game. Unfortunately I have not bookmarked it, but
    it was very nice. Maybe somebody else remembers the link.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I've personally found that learning to <em>see</em> space takes serious time
    and practice, and is easily trickier than drawing glyphs. So while I don't think
    that (1) belittling the original poster or (2) showing how super well other people
    can do their spacing is necessarily the most helpful thing, and while I also don't
    agree that spacing and kerning can or should be <em>completely</em> separate processes,
    I'd also say: forget about kerning for the moment; scrap what you have for spacing;
    and start over with it.\r\n \r\nTake your time with the spacing. Allow your eyes
    time to learn to see it. Use your eyes, but use a system for guidance. (I myself
    highly recommend the one Walter Tracy outlines in <em>Letters of Credit</em> as
    a starting point.) Spacing is very hard to critique from outside, so you'll probably
    largely need to trust your own eyes and your own system. Work on getting the spacing
    to a point where it works well in all but the most egregious exceptions, before
    you think of kerning again, which really should only be used to refine exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason BTW is not just that it's less work (in the long run) that way, but that
    you get better results in a variety of settings: Kerning is highly specific, whereas
    good spacing ensures a good overall \xABbase\xBB texture. If your font needs a
    lot of kerning to look decent, you'll easily be in trouble once someone tries
    to set a language you're unfamiliar with that uses character sequences you didn't
    test. And obviously you can never test all combinations that anybody might want
    to use, so it's advisable to have a stable basis and refine from there (through
    kerning). Also, there are still applications that don't support kerning."
