body: "Hello, \r\nI am using FontLab Studio 5. \r\nI am building an OT font that is
  all caps. My client requests that I have leading be 1\" from baseline to baseline
  when set at 70pts. I figured that would be about 70/72. In fontlab I have tried
  countless ways to do this in the custom values with no change. The only value I
  am working with is the caps height which is 706 as there are no descenders, ascenders
  or lower case glyphs in the font.\r\n\r\nany insight/help is appreciated!!\r\n\r\nthanks."

    it 706, or so.
