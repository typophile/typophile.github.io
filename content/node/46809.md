  body: LTC Forum by Fred Goudy would be an example. Do you mean another font based
    on Roman lapidary letterforms, or do you mean stylistic alternates?

  body: 'If you don''t need something very close, consider looking at the caps in
    your roman fonts. Often the regular caps, spaced out a bit, can serve very nicely
    as titling. Vendetta Light, Legacy Serif, Jenson, Iowan Old Style, Albertina,
    Perpetua, Adobe Garamond, Celestia Antiqua, Trajanus, Deepdene, Michelangelo,
    and Optima Titling have lovely sets of caps. '

    alternates and cap ligatures.

  body: "Waters Titling is an excellent suggestion because you have so many more options
    for weights as well as width. It also holds up better at smaller sizes. \r\n\r\nI
    forgot about the Baroque set from Letter Perfect; 3 different typefaces also based
    on Roman inscriptional lettering. "

    get something like Aviano. You never said what it was you were looking for in
    terms of traits, qualities, features, or why you don''t want Trajan. '
