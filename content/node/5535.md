body: 'I&#39;m working on the redesign of a large government document. Its content
  is updated by the client on a weekly basis. Even so, I&#39;m trying to raise the
  general level of typography in the document. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to improve their
  use of fractions. They currently write 3.25 like so: 3-1/4. The difference between
  a slash and a fraction bar is beyond them, to say nothing of baseline shifts and
  point-size reduction. <BR> <BR>Because of the shear number of fractions in the book,
  they <i>might</i> be willing to use a seperate fraction font. Body copy is in Helvetica
  Neue 45. Anyone have recommendations on a matching fraction font? Helvetica Fractions
  seems too heavy. Any other possibilities?'
