    <BR>on another topic: whats with this naming-the contest-on-the-actual-shirt-thing
    that keeps happening. that&#39;s just bizarr to be wearing a t-shirt that says
    the t-shirt was part of a competition.  <BR> <BR>the fact that this is a contest
    should have nothing to do with the design. imagine Christian Dior starting labelling
    couture with graphics front and center stating its part of the &#34;fall collection&#34;  <BR>
    <BR>or a poster that said &#34;poster&#34; under the topical issue title of the
    poster. '

    and more elegant without the key on the front.

  body: Yeah, Chesh, 24.0012 is the type id quiz personified. <BR> <BR>There are some
    real standouts among these. I&#39;d be proud  <BR>to wear almost any of them.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;Do you mean <a href="http://www.funnygarbage.com/" target="_blank">this
    Funny Garbage</a> logo? Similar maybe, <BR>but not deal breaker.&#41;

  body: Chesh, good idea. At the <i>bottom</i> of the back, that way you could bend
    over&#42; and have people read it without having to go totally upside down - good
    human interface design! <BR> <BR>&#42; Don&#39;t go there... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: The Letraset one is cool but how many people remember Letraset. I&#39;m old
    enough to but how about a 20 something year old. I have heard statistics that
    make me shake my head in terms of kids not knowing history. Like some kids never
    knew a time before the internet. Dan

    the key on the back though. Would make the shirt perfect imo. <BR> <BR>-dh

- body: 12 is very nice but it feels off balance. The first three letters are cropped
    almost identically, and the last four identically, with the o kind of in between.
    This was probably done on purpose but I don&#39;t like all the white space at
    the beginning. If they were recropped more randomly.. I think it would probably
    be my favorite so far.

  body: i agree with Bryan that this difference <BR>of white space creates a restless
    tention,  <BR>though i guess the designer wanted  <BR>to separate the two synthetic
    words  <BR>of typophile. <BR> <BR>So, this restless has a cause  <BR>and i would
    &#34;forgive&#34; it. I also believe  <BR>that 012 is the winner of the tees above.
