  body: 'To help on one of your fonts to get you started is fine, I think, but really,
    this is your assignment, and I think you should do it yourself. I&#39;m not going
    to be a completely wet blanket about it, though: I&#39;ll give you the link to
    <a href="http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/">Brands of the World</a>, a site with
    thousands of worldwide company logos. Spend some time sifting through there, and
    I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find examples of the fonts you&#39;re looking for. <BR>
    <BR>This has been advice of the &#34;give Mikey a fish and he&#39;ll eat for a
    day, teach Mikey to fish and he&#39;ll eat for a lifetime&#34; variety. It&#39;s
    given with the utmost respect for the challenges you face as a student. <BR> <BR>Good
    luck!'

  body: Let me also add -- and I know this is totally unhelpful -- that I do sympathize
    with you, as I think it&#39;s an utterly ridiculous assignment. Better, I think,
    to have the assignment be more like what we do here everyday, i.e., taking a sample
    and identifying the type. Your assignment is the other way around, and I just
    don&#39;t see the value of it. It&#39;s kind of like a wild goose chase. <BR>
    <BR>That said, it&#39;s your assignment, and therefore it&#39;s your responsibility.
    If you can, however, choose a different instructor next time.

  body: I don&#39;t quite understand, do you mean you need examples of logos using
    the fonts that you listed? <BR> <BR>If so, Optima is the face of Estee Lauder.
    Someone, I can&#39;t remember who, said that font looks like a 50-year-old with
    multiple facelifts.  <BR> <BR>Or perhaps in today&#39;s less invasive context,
    too many Botox shots. <BR> <BR>:P

  body: I strongly agree with Chesh that it&#39;s not our job to do your homework,
    primarily because you don&#39;t learn anything except how to ask for help &#40;sometimes
    not a bad thing to do either&#41;. <BR> <BR>If your assignment is to find logos
    &#40;or advertisements?&#41; that use  a certain list of typefaces, that is a
    bogus way to do it, but I&#39;m not your instructor.  <BR> <BR>If the assignment
    is to identify 50 different typefaces used in ads, then you need a decent set
    of font samples &#40;i.e. a good font book would be nice&#41;, and then start
    flipping through lots of magazines with plenty of advertising, like Fashion and
    Travel magazines. <BR> <BR>If you were a real font fanatic, like some of us, you
    would already have had a folder of ads ripped from magazines with font names written
    on them. <BR> <BR>Welcome to the wild world of Font Spotting! <BR> <BR>
