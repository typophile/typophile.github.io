  body: There doesn&#39;t seem to be an appropriate typeface to aid those with dyslexia.
    For every typeface that seems to have some useful feature that would assist a
    reader with this specific learning disability, it always has an accompanying drawback.  <BR>As
    mentioned it is &#34;the repetition of forms that causes dyslexia&#34; i.e. arial,
    comic sans <BR> <BR>Serifs vs Sans <BR>Comic Sans, Arial and other typefaces noted
    for aiding dyslexics are all too similiar in stroke weight and style adding no
    variance between letters such as o,e,c etc. <BR>The problem with serifs, then,
    is that they aid in the speed of reading, making it easier to pass over a word.
    This would deter phoenitic spelling. <BR> <BR>&#34;Phonology is a skill underlying
    the analysis of both spoken and written language, breaking words into their parts,
    so that &#39;cat&#39; can be broken into &#39;c-a-t&#39; ... These skills need
    to develop at around the age of 5 years if children are to learn to read successfully.
    If this does not develop, they are reliant on learning to read whole words that
    they have to recognise visually &#40;orthography&#41;.&#34; <BR>    -DR Lindsay
    Peer CBE  <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Dyslexic children need longer to read a word that
    is familiar to them &#40;van der Leij and van Daal, 1999&#41;. This may lead to
    a strategy of trying to process large chunks of letters in reading, rather than
    breaking the word down phonologically in order to read unfamiliar words.  <BR>This
    approach makes heavy demands on working memory and limits the number of new words
    that can be tackled.&#34; <BR>   -Wolf and Bowers &#40;1999&#41; <BR> <BR>CAPS,
    on the other hand, will slow down the reader and force them too read each letter.
    <BR>Typefaces faces such as Electra uppercase have serifs that point down at a
    45 degree angle which would naturally add letterspace &#40;a necessary factor
    to aid in reading in children and dyslexics&#41;. This would also break apart
    a flush line atop of the letters. <BR> <BR>Another problem with serifs is that
    they can have too much contrast &#40;particularly didots&#41; causing eye strain
    resulting in reading fatigue; as well as confusion between letters due to extra
    details &#40;the opposite of Comic Sans&#41; <BR> <BR>It is interesting to see
    that the designer of Comic Sans also designed Fabula, a font designed specifically
    for children. Depending on what you read, this may be a help or a hinderance.
    It may prolong, or help with the discovery of any children with learning disabilities.
    <BR><a href="http://www.kidstype.org/Other%20projects/fabula.html" target="_blank">www.kidstype.org/Other%20projects/fabula.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>It doesn&#39;t seem like there is any clear answer to choosing an appropriate
    typeface to aid in the reading of those with dyslexia. Something in the middle
    of the board may do the trick.  <BR>Optima? But, that&#39;s a whole other discussion
    of type prejudices. <BR> <BR>My apologies if this got confusing anywhere along  the
    way, but it&#39;s a bit confusing writing in such a confined space ad hoc.

    <BR> <BR>So the question is, does the &#34;mental writing&#34; that occurs in
    reading trace the exact forms, or is it a generalization of a generalization.
    If the ability to generalize can be equated with the process of learning to read
    fluently, it follows that the dyslexic has difficulty generalizing. <BR> <BR>In
    which case, is it easier to generalize from a precise form, confusing in its repetition,
    than from a more unique form, which suffers from distractingly complex idiosyncracy?
    This must be the dilemma that makes reading so hard for some. <BR> <BR>Oz Cooper&#39;s

    the reason for this lack is the infatuation with regular forms &#40;coming from
    Modernism&#41;. Designers tend to be too concerned with superficial form, so they
    make their shapes formally harmonious, but this ignores the deeper, subconscious
    harmonies of reading - and I mean general reading, not even for special cases
    like dyslexics. A font that would work well for dyslexics &#40;or work exceptionally
    well for the general readership&#41; will look unacceptable to the &#34;artistes&#34;...
    Unfortunately, they&#39;re the majority with the technical training - analytical
    thinkers rarely make it into design. <BR> <BR>BTW, from your quotes it&#39;s interesting
    that dyslexics actually seem to be using a strategy that proficient adult readers
    use! Picking off large structures inctead of individual letters. Not all the time,
    just as much as possible. <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html"
