body: "Hi there,\r\nI wonder if anyone can recomend a font that is easy to work with
  and could be used both in headlines as well as in body copy?\r\n\r\nWhat I am after
  is a sans serif or maybe a slab serif that has a both contemporary and human look
  and comes in many weights. That last thing is really important and it is also there
  almost all of the ones I find fail.\r\n\r\nI have tried Bliss and Corporate E but
  I would like to find and try another options.\r\n\r\n/Rika"
