body: "When I started working in the games industry, I made games for the Nintendo
  and Super Nintendo consoles. Font designs consisted of bitmap fonts, monospaced
  in 8 pixel squares. Any resemblance to vector fonts was purely coincidental. When
  I started making PC games, I could create proportionally spaced bitmap fonts by
  typing out lines in Photoshop using TrueType fonts. The hinting ans smoothing was
  done manually by pushing individual pixels. The end result bore some resemblance
  to the original fonts but not much. The bitmap graphic, usually one long string
  of 2-8 color bitmap glyphs was saved as a RAW file and processed by a custom tool.
  The custom tool generated code for a font system, designed specifically for that
  game. Later . . . in the PlayStation 2 days, there were off-the-shelf tools which
  could automatically convert fonts into bitmap fonts for use in games. I'm not in
  the games business anymore so I'm not sure how it works now.\r\n\r\nSome font EULAs
  are specific about low res bitmap use while others make no mention of it. My <a
  href=\"http://www.typodermic.com/license.html\">EULA</a> specifies embedding as
  something which will prevent the unlicensed user from installing or using a font:
  a proprietary bitmap format would qualify as embedding.\r\n\r\nWhat are the legal
  limitations for game designers generating low-res bitmaps for use in game font systems?
  Is there a difference between manually pixel editing a crude bitmap, a smoother
  medium-res version or a 256 pixel high embedded bitmap font. Have there been cases
  of game companies being sued for using fonts to generate bitmap fonts for games?\r\n\r\nI
  ask because people have asked me that question often and I honestly don't know."

  body: "I would hazard that, with those awfully fast CPUs and loads of memory, game
    designers take the easy road and just add the FreeType library to their code.
    That's an Open Source package, so there are no software limitations (other than
    acknowledging its use); but it <em>does</em> mean the game also has to include
    original, unmodified outline fonts.\r\n\r\nAt least two games I own come with
    complete TTFs; one of them is WarCraft 3, with the instantly recognizable Friz
    Quadrata. Of course, these files are more-or-less shielded against blatantly installing
    them into the user's system (they are packaged into larger data files), but at
    least for me it was no problem at all extracting the font. (That was just \"to
    prove a point\", as I was wondering if it <em>indeed</em> was an original TTF.
    It was. I dunno what sort of license Blizzard used.)\r\n\r\nFreeType is a 21th
    century solution, as it depends on a fast computer with a rather high resolution
    (and ideally, a true color display) -- then again, surely you are not talking
    about 8x8 bitmap fonts anymore? Fat chance anyone can even tell the difference
    between Times and Helvetica with such dimensions ..."

  body: "Bitmap fonts still have advantages over outline fonts when it comes to performance
    in console games. I'm not aware of any commercial font EULA* that allows for the
    creation and distribution of derivative bitmap fonts, so typically you'd need
    to get those rights from the type designer. Although I\u2019m sure there are game
    developers that don't always get the rights they need, but I think the major players
    will usually do the right thing \u2013 pay for the additional rights or use freeware
    fonts. \r\n\r\nIn terms of licensing the bitmap-rights cost is typically less
    than rights to ship the TTF. These days though the game itself tends to be the
    easy part, there's the Web version, packaging, manuals, translation and localizations.\r\n\r\n*Exception
    may be the new FontFont EULA, but that also has restrictions."

    is  programmatically \u201Cderived\u201D from the outline font I don\u2019t see
    much relevance to the resolution. If the bitmap font is created from scratch (which
    is no longer the norm), then the standard font redrawing issues apply."
