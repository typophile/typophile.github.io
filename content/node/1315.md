  body: Haha. These are fun. <BR> <BR>15.002 makes me think of that old school Tootsie
    Roll  <BR>commercial... <i>Everything in the world I see, Becomes a  <BR>Tootsie
    Roll to me...</i> <BR> <BR>15.003. Bam! <BR> <BR>15.005 is great in its simplicity/elegance.

  body: 15.003 should have the initial letters a different color, and the back could
    then say, &#34;Typophile is my BAG.&#34; But of course, we&#39;re not living in
    the 70s anymore. &#40;Don&#39;t tell the House guys, though!&#41; <BR> <BR>I like
    15.005, but I&#39;d like it much better reversed on some strong dark color, like
    brick, green, or black. I&#39;d like to see bigger daggers, too. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    understand what 15.006 has to do with type, but the illustration is cool.

  body: '15.002 has a nice concept but the style looks very similar to the Fuel brand
    - not only the same type of car but same perspective and colour scheme.  <BR>
    <BR>unfortunately fuelindustries site is in restruct but...you can see some of
    their look and feel: <a href="http://www.fuelindustries.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fuelindustries.com/</a>
    <BR> <BR>then again perhaps the illustrator base drawing thing is pretty popular
    in general. '

  body: 004 is way too big for my taste, and i dont think typophile stands out enuf.
    <BR>&#34;jesus commands&#34; is a pretty in your face statement, and probably
    most people wouldn&#39;t wear it.  beside that, the shirt color is icky for those
    keyboard keys. <BR>002 is my favorite--most typophile users, like me, can agree
    with what it says.  but please, can you resubmit the design with a different composition
    on the back?  &#34;i notice type...i am a typophile&#34; looks weird to me.  maybe
    it can be all centered or closer together or farther apart, or left aligned...  i
    dont know--just looks wrong to me.  great front though.
