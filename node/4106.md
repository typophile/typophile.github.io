    <BR>you will have to solve the simlarities betwen the A,O and D. And betwen the
    X, the U, and the V <BR> <BR>i think that a reasonable way will be not to force
    all the characters with the two foots you gave them, and i also think that the
    Z could be solved some way else, it escapes a little bit of the other forms <BR>
    <BR>anyway <BR>nicework <BR> <BR>CG '

  body: ' Thanks, Cristian... <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;m married to the idea of them
    having the feet ALTHOUGH I did do a version without the feet... it was pretty
    easy to do at the same time. <BR> <BR>What I was working toward was sort of a
    cursive stencil. It needs a lot of work but it could be fun. '

    so elite, you lift them off the baseline, so they don&#39;t get dirty. '
