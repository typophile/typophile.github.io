  Portland is filled with old building painted with great typography. It's very railroad/lumber
  yard looking (which is Portland's roots). The film is going to capture the essence
  of the rustic city, by featuring a sound track of all local artists and using old
  typography.\r\n\r\nI've attached some examples of the buildings, and some scans
  out of a book. I am NOT looking for a distressed font, or anything cheesy like that.
  I plan to use slighty imperfect letter spacing (as the type was painted by hand)
  and faded colors. Of course, I am really open to suggestions for interesting (but
  not over the top) type treatment ideas.\r\n\r\nIf there are any typefaces you know
  of that are similar to what I've attached, it would be most appreciated. Bonus points
  if the type or typography has any historical relevance to the northwest.\r\n\r\nThanks
  all!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NWType_4294.jpg]"

    publisher, OSO Publishing/Evergreen Hill, which produced some books on the rails
    out there. They are a great resource. \r\n\r\nI partiularly love the Uintah Railway
    Co. My favorite is the 2-6-6-2 Steam engine used by them.\r\n\r\nTrains were the
    recipient of some great lettering/type so I would not discount the RR as a source.
    Cool stuff and some wonderful  lettering/type on engines, buildings and signage.\r\n\r\nGuess
    you can tell what I do in my spare time. HO all the way. Get your minds out of
    the gutter... HO is a train guage. Not you Justin ; )\r\n\r\n Michael"

  body: "Your examples look to be from a wide time span but some simple ideas are:
    \r\n-Neutratext, it has a similar feel.  \r\n-akzidenz grotesk (similar to what
    you have at the bottom-and the most prevelant pre-Helvetica Sans so probly in
    your time frame). \r\n-Belwe (pretty classic)\r\n-Ottomat\r\n-Candida (personal
    favorite)\r\n-Trade gothic (obvious! the classic face of the industrial revolution-this
    guy practically built the railroads!)\r\n-Americana (a bit played out but relevant)\r\n-AmfacParksHeadline
    (essentially serifed version of Trade)\r\n\r\n-Hope some of those help. You're
    project sounds cool-the time in which Portland came up be was an interesting time
    for design and typography in general. Good Luck keep us posted\r\n"

  body: "A wonderful aside.\r\n\r\nWhen I got into lettering in the early eighties
    I searched out a couple of the surviving old guys who did some of the buildings
    here in Richmond. \r\n\r\nOne of them who was at least late in his nineties told
    me... \"Ain't a one of them (type designers, I assume) know what they're doin'.
    I have to borrow an N from this style and an A from that one and then finagle
    them to work on the building, ain't enough room for the damn showoff ten dollar
    names. Inc. or Co. don't make a damn to me! Just shorten the rest of the malarky.

  body: "Justin,\r\n\r\nA little nit to pick about terminology: Type is not the same
    as lettering, and typography is not the same as type. \r\n\r\nTypeface: A suite
    of glyphs or letterforms designed to work together as a system, a \"type design\"\r\n\r\nFont:
    the module, hardware, software or other unit you use to set type, based on the
    type design (see above)\r\n\r\nLettering: hand-lettering includes hand-painted
    signs, calligraphy, informal and formal brush lettering, drawn and cutout letters
    made uniquely for a specific use. Lettering of any kind can be reproduced and
    applied digitally to printed matter or used to make a pattern for signs, logos,
    and other applications. Whatever form it's in, hand-lettering is not type. Specific
    logos with intertwined letters, logos that fit into shapes, monograms or other
    word marks can't simply be taken apart to make typefaces, and are just one element
    to be used in typographic composition. \r\n\r\nTypography: The use and application
    of typefaces. Could be stretched to include the use of logos and other letterforms\r\n\r\nThere
    are typeface designs based on hand-lettering (see the work of the talented Michael
    Clark - typerror -  for example), but those are typefaces, based on hand-lettering
    styles. Michael can do marvelous hand-lettering as well (not true of everyone
    who has made typefaces based on lettering). Michael has skills in calligraphy
    and brush lettering that set him apart. Those skills do not necessarily add up
    to \"typography\", although a lettering artist has to understand spacing, consistency
    and other things that make a piece of lettering click. \r\n\r\nSorry to be so
    dogmatic, but these terms are still useful in discussing your topic, signage on
    buildings. It's terrific and I hope you'll share links to the film when it's done.
    There was a thread here recently that explored whether there are localized lettering
    styles in every city, such as the vernacular lettering that Gotham was based on.
    I hope so. Patzcuaro is another typeface based on the particular lettering style
    seen on all the public signs in Patzcuaro, Mexico. Originally those signs were
    hand-lettered. "

  body: "Well if Carl is going to be dogmatic... there is a difference between calligraphy
    and lettering. The latter implies that the calligraphy was augmented or was not
    done in a single stroke, but built up... but that is kind of archaic in this day
    and age.\r\n\r\nCarl, do you have a valid e-mail address? It bounces back from

  body: "Carl, with all due respect, if you do feel the need to preach to others then
    it is best you have your facts straight before you begin. I agree with the main
    point of your post that <em>\u201CType is not the same as lettering, and typography
    is not the same as type.\u201D</em> But beyond that many of your definitions above
    are pretty inaccurate and/or misleading. I feel you could have explained yourself
    in about half the words you used and alleviated the need for my lengthy waffle!
    \r\n\r\n<em>\"Font: the module, hardware, software or other unit you use to set
    type, based on the type design (see above)\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nYour definition of
    a font doesn't seem to make any sence. If I am understanding you correctly here,
    you are suggesting that a font is the tool you use to set type, a Linotype machine
    or InDesign for example? The [[http://typophile.com/node/13544?|Typowiki]] states
    in nice simple terms that \u201C<em>a font can be said to be one weight, width,
    and style of a typeface</em>\u201D. Or an older, yet still relevant definition
    of can be found on the real [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font|Wikipedia]] where
    it defines a font as \u201C<em>as a complete character set of a single size and
    style of a particular typeface</em>\u201D (digital fonts are no longer limited
    to size as they are scalable). Also, to the best of my knowledge a digital font
    is not regarded as a piece of software, I may be wrong about this.\r\n\r\n<em>\u201CTypeface:
    A suite of glyphs or letterforms designed to work together as a system, a \u2018type
    design\u2019\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nTo begin with I have never heard of a typeface
    being referred to as a \u201Ctype design\u201D. Obviously a typeface is a piece
    of design but it's not referred to as such. Your definition of a typeface sounds
    closer to the definition of a font. Again the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface|Wikipedia]]
    provides another straight forward definition: \u201C<em>a typeface is a set of
    one or more fonts designed with stylistic unity, each comprising a coordinated
    set of glyphs</em>\u201D. I would actually go so far as to challenge the Typowiki
    definition of a typeface, which is already being discussed [[http://typophile.com/node/39843|here]],
    and it would seem that the term is open to interpretation. Yet neither the Typowiki
    nor the Wikipedia make any reference to \"type design\" with regard to a typeface.\r\n\r\n<em>\u201CTypography:
    The use and application of typefaces. Could be stretched to include the use of
    logos and other letterforms\"</em>\r\n\r\nI don't believe that that typography
    can stretch to include logos unless you are talking about a purely typographic
    logotype. Once you combine a graphic element with a typographic element you create
    the most clear-cut example of graphic design. Graphic Design : The combination
    of image and typography to communicate an idea. But now I'm nit picking!\r\n\r\nCarl
    I respect the fact that you have many years of experience in the field of typography
    and I am assuming you do know what you are talking about, however I think I have
    explained with references a number of problems with the definitions you have given
    above.\r\n\r\nNaoise"
