body: From a specimen book turning yellow with age, a new business associate has come
  up with a font I need to identify. Please see attachment - part of a prototype he
  did the way we used to do it 25 years ago - cardboard, glue, cover sheet. The font
  is not unlike the Franklin Gothic family - but the tail of the Q comes off the middle
  of the bottom and curls right. Assistance appreciated.    UnklChuk    <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40959.gif"

  body: The A &amp; Y in your sample are not monotone, and that makes it look like
    the ATF version of Franklin Gothic, which has that style of R. News Gothic has
    that style of R, but it is monotone. Your Q description made me think of Folio,
    but it doesn&#39;t have that kind of R, and it is not monotone either. I think
    foundries had types they just called Gothics, with numbers &#40;like Gothic No.18&#41;,
    but at least the ones in my old Linotype book, looked mostly like Franklin Gothic
    with the right-of-center Q tail, and the majority of them were condensed. <BR>
    <BR>If you could show the Q, M and G &#40;if all you have is upper case&#41; it
    would make IDing it easier.

  body: Yes, it&#39;s all caps. The loose sheets I have don&#39;t include a G - so
    here&#39;s Q, M &amp; Z. &#40;Thank you.&#41;<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40970.gif"

  body: Except for the Q it looks like an extra heavy weight of Franklin Gothic. I
    looked &#40;quickly&#41; through Mac McGrew&#39;s book on American Metal Typefaces,
    and didn&#39;t see a Franklin Gothic this heavy. Often at extreme weights some
    of the letterforms are changed. Maybe that&#39;s why this Q is different from
    the usual Franklin Gothic? Another explanation is that sometimes when there is
    a very popular typeface, as this was for many decades, other foundries develop
    alternative versions with new names, and one or two slight differences to avoid
    the appearance of copying the type. This could be from such a face. <BR> <BR>Do
    you know whose specimen book it&#39;s from? Is it American? How old is it? <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ll keep looking, but I&#39;m running out of showings of old typefaces.

  body: Some of the Grotesques have similar Q&#39;s, but in almost every case I saw,
    the R was unlike this one, and usually the letters were monotone &#40;even weight
    strokes&#41;. <BR> <BR>Record Gothic, designed by R. H. Middleton has a Q like
    this and the right sort of R, but it is also monotone. <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;ve
    used up my resources. My best guess is that this is a heavy weight variation of
    Franklin Gothic from some relatively obscure foundry &#40;whose types didn&#39;t
    make any of the books I looked through&#41;.

    <BR>My business associate will want something with a similar &#34;feel&#34; -
    clean and strong. I&#39;d like something that also has a little more interest,

  body: Absolutely ask for suggestions on alternative fonts if the original is not
    available.  <BR> <BR>One alternative -- especially if your associate wants a number
    of different weights, is <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/knockout/index.html">Knockout</a>
    by H&amp;FJ. The letterforms are different, but on the whole it&#39;s a very powerful
    face with many weights.

  body: I think that&#39;s a fair question. What we don&#39;t appreciate is &#39;can
    you tell me where I can get something like it for free?&#39; <BR> <BR>My suggestion
    is to go over to <a href="http://www.fontpool.com/categories/index.html" target="_blank">
    The Font Pool</a> and pick the style category you are interested in. Then type
    in a word or two that you want to use. They will show you hundreds, if not thousands
    of fonts using those words &#40;or letters&#41;, and you can pick one that way.
    <BR> <BR>The reason I suggest that, instead of suggesting a font, is that &#39;clean
    and strong&#39;, &#39;interest&#39;, &#39;finish&#39; and &#39;contemporary&#39;
    are all very subjective terms. You know what you mean by them. <BR> <BR>You can
    also do something similar at MyFonts.com if you register. You can set up your
    own sample phrase for the font showings. <BR> <BR>Now, having said all that, I
    will say that what seems &#39;contemporary&#39; these days is geometric fonts,
    because we are in a retro stage where Art Deco and Bauhaus looks are apparently
    &#39;in&#39; again. Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones Gotham is used a lot, and Futura
    is timeless and has lots of weights. I&#39;d start with one of those.
