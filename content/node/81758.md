body: "Hello there, I'm new here. I'm doing a research for my final work in college
  (I don't know how you call this is english, it's a big final work we have to do
  in order to graduate - btw I'm brazilian). \r\n\r\nI need to edit a book. And in
  my particular case I will have to write it too, and it will be about typography
  history. At first I thought about writing on Nicolas Jenson's work, but there is
  so little material on him, I would have to travel to Venice to do a decent job and
  that is out of the question right now. So I broadened my subject to venetian type
  designers in the early renaissance. I've been trying to collect enough material
  on this, but I still have little, and I'm tired to get books that dedicate only
  a small chapter (most of them not even a chapter) on the subject. I know there is
  a book about Aldus Manutius, but what about others like Nicolas Jenson? Do you have
  some good recs for me? I already have things like Megg's History of Graphic Design,
  the book on Aldus Manutius written by Enric Santu\xE9, and some others. I'm at a
  point where I'm almost changing my subject to old english type designers\u2026 there
  is a lot more material on them, but I really wanted to write about those venetians,
  I felt in love with the examples I saw.\r\n\r\nI will also need as many images as
  I can find to illustrate my work. \r\n\r\nThis is not a book that will be actually
  published, but I have to print 2 or 3 copies of it and I understand I need to get
  permissions to use images. \r\n\r\nThank you for any tips,\r\n\r\nShendel"

    a calligrapher and professor of typographic history at politecnico di Milano (Italy).
    His roman alphabet knowledge is impressive, and he knows extremely well Aldo Manuzio
    and his associate Francesco Griffo; the one who designed the first <em>italic</em>
    ever, in Venice."

  body: "There really isn't much information about those early printers, especially
    Jenson. They were just skilled tradesmen who did not live especially extraordinary
    lives (unlike the French type designers, who did stuff like get burned at the
    stake). The best reference I can think of would be the relevant chapters of the
    first volume of D. B. Updike's <em>Printing Types</em>, which covers a few more
    of them, but in no great detail.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think you probably need to
    reconsider your topic. The best you can do with this topic is regurgitate the
    same factoids about the Venetian printers that everyone else has been regurgitating
    for the last century. Your time would be much better spent finding a way to examine
    their work as it is relevant to contemporary design that has not already been
    covered ad infinitum. "

  body: "History does tend to look for precedent and subsequent professional acclaim,
    rather than record the overall picture of an era.\r\n\r\nHence the dominance of
    Jenson.\r\n\r\nWhen I see the work of other printers of the Incunabula, I am struck
    by the variety of their work, extending to alphabetic form\u2014in particular
    widespread adoption of the lower case \"h\" with a curved right leg, which Jenson
    demonstrated was Not the way ahead; he defined the roman alphabet, with the exception
    of the \"e\"s crossbar, which was later flattened, and the inside serifs on the
    top of the capital \"M\", which were subsequently removed."
