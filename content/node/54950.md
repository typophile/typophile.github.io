    (influenced by [[FF Meta]]). And possibly AT&T's custom version of it if you got

  body: Is it now impossible to edit your own postings after a while? As on the Whatthefont-forum,
    where you can edit your posts only within 15 minutes?

  body: "Yes, that\u2019s correct. I don\u2019t know the exact time range, but you
    can edit your posts only within a couple of minutes after posting, and only if
    no-one else has posted in the same thread, methinks."
