  body: Martin, please post a PDF so we can blow it up, shrink it down, and otherwise
    put it through its paces.  <BR> <BR>The euro sign looks quite drunk, though ;&#41;

  body: i feel there is some sort of &#39;hurry up and slow down&#39; effect happening
    in some of these letters. almost like my eyes don&#39;t know which direction to
    move. &#40;the best example i can see from what you provided is the e and r combo
    in over&#41; the lc &#39;o&#39; also pushes me off the line i&#39;m looking at.
    i&#39;m doubting the characters are kerned but that may have something to do with
    the feeling of unsteadiness and random direction. i find my eyes wandering when
    the letters are far apart and close together. BUT, i feel a lot of energy and
    rigidity in what i am seeing. like my eye is kinda riding down a bumpy road and
    feeling all the irregularities. i think the uc A is a little small...width and
    height....i couldnt get the pdf to work real great for some reason. i&#39;m sure
    it&#39;s just my outdated version of acrobat, but i really like the irregularity
    and imperfect forms in their own way. i&#39;d say if you could bottle it and make
    it work as a uniform characteristic you have something interesting and a little
    off-center. i sorta feel in the current state it&#39;s so-so for readable type
    but alot of the problems are easily solved, i&#39;m sure. take care <BR> <BR>will

  body: I think the lowecase is quite ok, despite some details &#40;the &#39;a&#39;,
    the exaggerated &#39;x&#39;, the bowl of &#39;g&#39; is too big and the connection
    between the bowls is weak&#41; that can be improved. <BR> <BR>But looking at the
    other characters, I think you need to impose some consistency to your glyphs.
    Irregularity can certainly help legibility in text, but you need balance.
