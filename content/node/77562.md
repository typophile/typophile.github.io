  is a canadian discount card where people will get a discount or offer for using
  the card. \r\n\r\n\r\nI did not want to use the dark top or that horrible look for
  the navigation. I need help improving the overall look of the banner and the call

  body: "I enjoy the color pallate. \r\nI agree with ditching the ribbon, too stern.
    \r\nWhat if it had more of a fluidity to it? Or became a background element rather
    than a band over the card?\r\n\r\nI actually enjoy the tool bar, but I may add
    a bit more dimension.\r\nI am not completely sold on the use of Mueso for this.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the type treatment above the card is very nice."
