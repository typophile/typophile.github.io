<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Allow me to preface this post by mentioning that the logo I currently use was concepted about five years ago when I just began working with online media. At the time, I had just started using my 'Xenethyl' alias and wanted to design a logo for myself. Looking around at other icons, I found myself very drawn to Eidos' Hitman logo (as many of you gamers will likely realize).
Since the original drafting of my logo I have progressed to the point where I now do freelance graphic and web work as a hobby under Xen Graphics Studios. The name comes partly from my online alias and partly from a play on the word 'zen.'
My backstory aside, I'm wondering if I may have taken too many visual cues from the Hitman logo in my personal design. If it's not readily apparent, my logo is supposed to represent a stylized 'X,' which, sliced in half, plays somewhat on the idea of zen and balance.
Over the years I have really become attached to the original design, though in recent months I have felt the need to update it and make the curves and weighting a bit more balanced and professional-looking. At the same time, as I have become more involved in the graphic world I have gained an immensely high level of respect for designers and artists. That being said, the last thing I want to do is blatantly rip off Eidos' hard work.
What do you all think? Was I too inspired by the Hitman logo in searching for my own branding? Links to the Hitman logo, my current logo and revision mock-ups, and my proposed final revision can be found below. Just to be clear, the updated logo I am looking to implement is the third link.

<div class=commentbody>They look too much alike to me. There would easily be brand confusion here which is bad for both of you.

<div class=commentbody>Seconded. Maybe try to pick up on some of the heavy contrast between curves and sharp angles, thin and fat, but pull it more towards a readable X?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Rough idea, but what if you were to push the logo even more as an X.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/X_5519.gif]</div>

<div class=commentbody>dezcom - I agree, brand confusion is not something that I want to deal with.
pica pusher - I think moving in a direction that makes the logo more easily distinguishable as an 'X' would be a good idea. It would at least allow me to continue using the same style.
vintagesignman - Thanks for the mock-up! I'll see if I can play with the design a bit and move it more towards a recognizable 'X.'
Tiffany - I hadn't considered the logo being faction-like, though I definitely agree with you. Maybe it was a sub-conscious thing...
Trick - I too started to notice that while I was looking over the different variations. I think slicing the icon in half helps to reduce the mask imagery, but maybe a little more treatment wouldn't hurt either.
Thanks to all of you that have posted your comments regarding this design. I really appreciate it.
I'll start working on some revisions and see if I can't make this logo be more unique and recognizable.</div>
