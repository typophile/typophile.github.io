  \u2013 \u2013\r\nGoosebreak is a project that took several years to emerge. After
  using a few syllabic fonts in my projects, I wanted to create typeface with a strong
  personality like its Harfang Pro that served as the basis for the design. This family
  is designed for all Canadian Aboriginal languages and adds to the few fonts available
  for these languages. It\u2019s available in 12 fonts that are suitable for both
  editorial writing and advertising.\r\n\r\n\u201CI named this font, <strong>Goosebreak</strong>.
  This name refers to the Spring goose-hunting season, in Cree, <cite>\u201Cnituwaaschenaanuu,\u201D</cite>
  which aboriginal communities of Northern Quebec attach great importance to.\u201D
  \tGoosebreak is <a href=\"http://www.andresimard.ca/en\">here</a>"

    ground while lending grace to the strokes. And it makes me so, so happy to see
    someone investing quality design on Canadian Aboriginal languages, which so often
    get short shrift. Thank you for working on this and sharing it with us, Andr\xE9."
