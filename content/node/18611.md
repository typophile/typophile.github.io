    let anyone drink out of.\r\n\r\nTry contacting Mike Essl (essl@cooper.edu), the
    current currator an the <a href=\"http://www.cooper.edu/art/lubalin\" target=\"new\">The
    Herb Lubalin Study Center of Design and Typography</a>.\r\n\r\nI probably have
    the dates in one of my annuals at home, but I'm in my office right now."
