body: I'm helping a classmate look for any info. leading to samples of Jan Tschichold's
  Saskia typeface. To our knowledge, it hasn't been digitized, but it's also difficult
  to find any printed samples or images online. Any help would be appreciated.

  body: "Unbelievable, actually, that Saskia escaped digitalization so far.\r\n\r\nWho
    will win that race?\r\n\r\nA bit off topic but loosely related: an exhibition
    on type design opens tomorrow [[http://www.kunstvereinleipzig.de/mein_typ.html|at
    a venue in Leipzig]]. \u2013 Just if you happen to be in the area. (It spans the
    focus on local matadors of the trade, from e.g. Belwe, Tiemann, Tschichold, Drescher,
    Kapr, K.-H. Lange, to those of us who continue the business nowadays). \u2013
    I\u2019ll report something later on."

  body: "Sch\xF6nheit and Charakter are letterspaced = bold.\r\nPresumably Saskia
    has no Bold, in the manner of old fraktur, where this convention for emphasis
    originated.\r\nAllegro makes a good bold for this:\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?21W\r\n\r\nc
    is only ever followed by h or k in German, so making these ligatures was an efficiency."
