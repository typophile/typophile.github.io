  body: "Because most hiring is done by people who have better things to do than read
    form letters, I don\u2019t use a cover letter unless I can find a good reason
    to write one. Good reasons include:\r\n- The firm actually asks for one.\r\n-
    I know who is getting the cover letter. It is much easier to make a cover letter
    meaningful if I can relate the text to the reader.\r\n- The firm has a body of
    work that I am actually familiar with and am able to reference. \r\n\r\nFrom these
    points you might notice that I object to form letters as cover letters. Always
    write a specific cover letter. Make it clear that you actually thought about why
    you want to work at a firm and that you are not just mailing them out to every
    firm in town. Something like \u201CI am very interested in corporate identity
    design and want to learn to produce work like the stuff your firm did for companies
    X, Y and Z\u201D is a good way to go. Name-dropping and flattery can also be good:
    \u201CProfessor and local AIGA president X recommended that I learn corporate
    identity design by interning for you because of your history of award-winning
    work in the field.\u201D"

  body: I second James's comment - you need to convince the design firm that you really
    want to work for THEM. Which means going on their site and educating yourself
    on what they do and customizing your letter to them. This was harder in my day,
    young man, when Al Gore hadn't invented the internet yet.

  body: "I advise students to keep their cover letters brief; they are essentially
    a way to introduce your resume and convey your interest.\r\nHit a couple of key
    accomplishments from your resume, express your interest in the internship, and
    draw a connection or two between your work and the work the studio produces. But
    again, keep it short.\r\nAbove all, inject a sense of your enthusiasm about the
    field in general, and your willingness to learn as much about it as possible."
