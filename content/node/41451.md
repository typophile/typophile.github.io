  It's similar to Rockwell or Aachen but different. In particular, the upper-case
  \"R\" has a curl in the leg that points up. I can't find an example of that but
  perhaps that will help in the identification. You can visit AMCtv.com for more examples
  of usage. I've attached one with the most characters visible here.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/Picture
