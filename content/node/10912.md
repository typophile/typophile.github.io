body: Numerica was inspired by Herbert Bayer, , Paul Renner, and JanTschichold and
  the Bauhaus deconstruction-simplification movement. I thought  ..what if these designers
  had been doing type in the 1960&#39;s and not 1920&#39;s. Add to that the element
  of numerical forms. And I would guess you would end up with Numerica.  <BR>I used
  this for Design Alchemy collateral until Dec. 2001. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/849.jpg"

  body: ' Numerical influence aside, i really like some of the forms. the second s
    is really great. It seems like most type designs play with the veneer of letterforms,
    but don&#39;t challenge the basic form. i don&#39;t typically care for faces that
    use numerical elements to mimic letters, it&#39;s a trick that&#39;s been done
    before, but i think that you have taken it one step further here. there are a
    few really unique shapes. i also dig the f and the second a. <BR> <BR>cr '

  body: ' Thanks Christian. I would like to do more work on this design but have parked
    it for now so I can work on Unicratica. Numerica served as the logo face for Design
    Alchemy for a couple of years but I have since changed it. '
