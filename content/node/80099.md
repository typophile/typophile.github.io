  body: I didn't think arial at first, the "O"s on the tiles are elliptical enough
    that you can tell when the tile is rotated.  Arial has a pretty circular "O."  Looking
    at it now, it looks like Bananagrams just used arial and maybe just changed the
    o a little bit.  Thanks for the help!

  body: yes I do think it's Arial with a widened O, thought it was Akzidenz-Grotesk
    (Basic Commercial) but I haven't really taken the time to make sure.
