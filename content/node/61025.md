body: "I'm working on a logo for a friend, who's opening his own plumber company.
  The companys name is \xABMR Sanit\xE4r Service & Boilerentkalkung\xBB. MR are the
  initials of his first name and surname. \r\n\r\nMy aproach is to use the initials
  as a monogram. The M symbolises the heater (radiator) and the R a wrench.\r\n\r\nUse
  of typeface: \r\nMR = Bauhaus 93 \r\nSanit\xE4r ... = Eras demi\r\n\r\nWhat do you
  think about the monogram and the use of typeface?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hear
  your crit!\r\n\r\nCheers \r\nChris\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile_5350.jpg]"

- body: "I think it's a fun idea, and I especially like the concept of an R as a wrench.
    The typeface is beautiful. \r\n\r\nBut ... a few things prevent it from really
    working. Until I read your description, I struggled to try and figure out what
    was going on. The bolt is very distracting because it's not obvious why it's there
    or what it is. The wrench doesn't look wrench-y enough, and my gut is telling
    me that's because it's chopped off so abruptly on the left and it's not actually
    gripping the bolt. It's in the perfect position to badly strip the bolt. (Bad
    plumber!)\r\n\r\nThe second issue is the radiator. I don't know about you, but
    the only time I've ever seen a slanted radiator was after an earthquake. So, it
    doesn't read as anything except a letter M, which is fine, but not really what
    you were hoping for, right? \r\n\r\nThird; do plumbers work on radiators? Can
    I guess that long word that begins with 'Boiler' means 'heating' somehow? \r\n\r\nThe
    mark vs the typography need work, too, mostly the scale, but I think I've said
    enough now. :) \r\n"

  body: "Thanx Alaskan for your crits, there are very helpful!\r\n\r\nI double checked
    if he works with radiators and you right, he doesn't. To keep my concept with
    the monogram, I removed the bolt and added a drop \u2013 so the M stands as M
    or as waterpipe. It is important that the MR is readable. The reason why I slanted
    the M is to have the same angle as the Eras typeface. I redesigned the the R so
    it's equally the letter or a wrench. Do you think the mark is to big? \r\n\r\nHere
    is an update!\r\n\r\nCheers \r\nChris\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile2_4684.jpg]"

  body: "Here is an other update with a different typeface (Myriad). The \xABR\xBB
    wrench is now behind the \xABM\xBB \u2013 so it doesn't attacks the \xABM\xBB
    anymore. I got rid off the the drop, i think it's too much! I'm not shure if yellow
    suits the Logo, I might try some other color version ...\r\n\r\nCheers \r\nChris\r\n\r\n\r\n

  body: "The MR in Myriad doesn't work for me. It's too short compared to the two
    lines below.\r\n\r\nThe monogram could now be read as MPR, I think. I would rejoin
    the tail and the bowl of the R.\r\n\r\nYellow on white could be difficult to see.\r\n\r\nRoss"

  body: "I agree, with the new monogram i read MPR. i think the first idea was better,
    i liked a lot the idea of the R to be a tool, whatever you try to do with the
    'm' as radiator, just forget that, a m and a tool a R is enough.\r\n\r\nlook at
    this one, its so simple and elegant, and the idea is brilliant.\r\nhttp://38one.com/cleverblog/martin-newcombe-property-maintenance"
