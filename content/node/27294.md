  is available here.\r\n\r\nI have a typeface that I'd really like to be able to use
  without making it myself...  and I'm hoping it's already out there.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RES-COPEN-1_5017.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy
  grandfather always chewed this brand of tobacco... as odd as it sounds, the logo
  is familiar and warm to me.  The typeface would look really great spelling my last
  name or in normal use...  and I was hoping someone would recognize it... if it already
  exists.\r\n\r\nThanks for even reading.  I hope to contribute myself now!"

  body: This logo is not a typeface, but hand lettered. Sorry to see there's a 'g'
    in your last name as it will be difficult to match that delightful thing. The
    rest isn't far from <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.115578.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Copenhagen&sampleSize=48">Erbar</a>
    of which there is only one digitization that's not condensed.

    isn't as close a match, but it has a handmade finish.
