body: "Here is a logo and some preliminary designs for stationery for a company providing
  high class programme for companies, events etc. The companys main focus is in performing
  arts and especially dance.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to silkscreen-print the business card
  in white to black cardboard. The letterhead is black on the other side with reflected
  logo (which can be faintly seen on the other side). \r\n\r\nThe logo is based on
  avant garde and the idea is to communicate professionalism and to separate the company
  from the others in the field. \r\n\r\nAny comments are welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/movingarts_4608.jpg]"

  body: "indeed ... I like it too ... I reckon it could do with some refinment though
    .. tweaking those letter forms. And some colour?\r\nit currently feels pretty
    rigid/static too though.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul

  body: They A is probably up there to fill the whitespace. Have you tried without
    it?
