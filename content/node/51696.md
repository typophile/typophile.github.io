  body: "It actually depends on what you want to achieve...\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    there aren't many of those fonts arround... I live/work in malaysia and often
    have to deal with multi-cultural audiences. Believe me, there are just not enough
    English fonts with Asian look arround. (I am trying to design some of these myself...)\r\n\r\nHere
    are some fonts we usually use and hope it helps- \r\n\r\ntry \"Rotis\" family
    (by Otl Aicher) , \"Mantina\" (by Matthew carter) or Mrs. Eaves (Zuzana Licko,
    Emigre) \r\n\r\nThese fonts provide both very decorative display as well as high
    quality text, and thus it's useful for a wide variety of applications. (again,
    it depends what you want to achieve...)\r\n\r\nIf you want \"Indian\"- try \"Matrix
    Script\" (Zuzana Licko, Emigre), but I don't think that's what you want and it's
    only for display.\r\n\r\nCheck out the series of fonts offered by Emigre, you
    might find what you need."
