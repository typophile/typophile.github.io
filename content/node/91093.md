  body: "This topic has come up before. Might want to search through the archives.\r\n\r\nMy
    go-to simple binding system has been 'prong fasteners' which are the things you
    used to see in medical folders:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.officemax.com/office-supplies/clips-fasteners-rubberbands/fasteners/product-prod1600015\r\n\r\nThey
    look nice when bound and come apart easily to pass individual pieces around if
    need be. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "If it's a leave-behind piece, you might consider doing it on 11 x 17 (folded
    in half to become 8.5 x 11) and saddle stitch it like a magazine. It's more trouble
    and expense, but it's a minimalist binding that doesn't get in the way of the
    piece's design.\r\n\r\nIf you don't plan to leave it behind, a 3-ring binder sounds
    clunky but has some advantages, such as the ability to lie flat and the pages
    are removable (you may want to change the assortment of pages depending on the
    client). There are some nice ones out there if you look hard enough; a Google
    for \"presentation binder\" or similar phrases may turn up some nice ones. You'd
    want a custom cover."
