body: "I was looking through an old type specimen book, and found a typeface called
  Ionic Shaded.   It didn't have a full alphabet, and I haven't been able to find
  any additional information on it. I redrew some of the letters, omitting the \"shaded\"
  part:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bluered_4600.gif]\r\n\r\nIs this
  face found under another name? Is there a digital equivalent somewhere?"
