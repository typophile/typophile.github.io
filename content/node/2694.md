  body: 'Looks like FFDax to me. Could be Giacomo, either, a bit hard to tell at a
    glance. But it looks a lot like DAX, which seems to be quite en vogue these last
    months... '

  body: Since Dax doesn&#39;t have stems that extend upward past the tops of the m
    or n, I don&#39;t think this can be Dax. Giacomo isn&#39;t right either, if that
    smaller text is the same face, because it has a y with a curved tail and Giacomo&#39;s
    is straight. Giacomo&#39;s a has a curved tail and this font doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m
    going off to search the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html"
