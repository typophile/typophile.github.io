  look handwritten (not too much be a font)\r\n- a little bit messy\r\n\r\nThis is
  what comes close, but it's:\r\n- free, so with all bugs that come with that.\r\n-
  not available with caps\r\n- a little bit too illegigle, but still very close.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Afbeelding1_5261.png]\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/violation.font\r\n\r\nI've
  loooked at my fonts / fontshop etc, but most llok too 'artificial'.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help, it's really appreciated.\r\n\r\nMarco"
