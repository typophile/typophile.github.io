  and Freight Big Light to the new, Opentype pro versions. I overlaid one on the other,
  set exactly the same, and it seems that the wordspacing in the Pro versions is much
  more generous. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if that's the case? Has the word spacing
  been opened up? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"
