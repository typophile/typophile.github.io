body: "First off, I read the FAQ section on how to post a request.  However, I do
  not know any details about when and where this font type originated.  It's used
  for a business name and we have lost ANY info related to the font type.  I stumbled
  across this cool site and thought I'd give it a try.  \r\n\r\nPS. There are two
  fonts.  I would LIKE to know both but the one with \"DUKE\" is more what I'm after.\r\n\r\nTHANKS!\r\n\r\n-JOSH\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dukeimg_5168.png]"
