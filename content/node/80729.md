body: "Attached is a font I'm looking for. It's a serif, looks like it's from the
  1800 hundreds (the poster this font is on was designed in the 90s). I went through
  all the serifs on fontshop (yeah all 4000+) and all on myfonts.com and couldn't
  track it down. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks guys I really appreciate the help!\r\n\r\n<a
