body: 'Could you suggest any sans serif font resembling Tarzana in its character?
  I&#39;m looking for something rather neutral, but on the other hand I would like
  the font to have a little twist, witty detail or whatever you would call that -
  some kind of &#34;je ne sais quoi&#34;, which makes its look a bit unusual. Moreover,
  I would like to use it to set plain texts and titles as well. Hm, I guest that is
  it: usability of Meta and uniqueness of Tarzana combined in one.  <BR> <BR>I would
  appreciate any help, many thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>przemek'

  body: 'Przemek <BR> <BR>There are of course many options, mainly based on personal
    taste. I&#39;m not sure if you find my typeface SOPHISTO apropriate or not for
    your project? It does have an extensive range of weights and variations though.
    It&#39;s also made for use in longer body copy. Still it carry some distinctive
    character. Find out more info here: <a href="http://www.macrhino.com" target="_blank">http://www.macrhino.com</a>

  body: Stefan <BR> <BR>Well, that&#39;s it. Sophisto is exactly what I had in mind,
    I will remember it when it comes to make a decision. By the way, I loved your
    GRAFICZ typeface. As I live in Krakow, I would love to see typefaces of such quality
    applied here, unfortunately it is rather hard to find good typography in the city.
    There are some exceptions though, but still - not too many of them. Thanks for
    the tip! <BR> <BR>przemek

  body: Przemek <BR> <BR>I&#39;m glad you find my typefaces apealing. Let me know
    if you have any further questions? Regarding Graficz, I&#39;ve had a passion for
    the Central European style. I worked as an Art Director  in Budapest back in &#39;93
    and spend tons of hours just walking around town studying the general graphic
    style, taking photos of signs etc. Btw Luminance is inspired by a Czech typeface
    originally. <BR> <BR>Cheers

  body: Stefan, <BR> <BR>One more question came to my mind regarding Sophisto - what
    serif font would you recommend to accompany the typeface? As the designer you
    probably have your favorites, I would be happy to know them.  <BR> <BR>Ah, Budapest
    10 years ago, it must have been a different world!... Maybe I am too sceptical,
    but I would not dare comparing Krakow to Prague, Brno or Budapest. The difference
    between the cities is quite significant, especially after 15 years of transformation.
    But perhaps it is only my impression and of course I can be wrong. <BR> <BR>przemek

  body: Przemek <BR> <BR>Well, a few text fonts which I like and think works well
    together with Sophisto are; <BR> <BR>Proforma &#40;Petr van Blockland&#41; <BR>Delicato
    &#40;my own&#41; <BR>Eidetic Serif &#40;Rodrigo Cavazos&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    sure there are many others, but you asked for my favourites ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>My
    Budapest experience was faboulus and fun. The city had many faces back then depending
    on which area you visited. I would love to go back and see the changes... I had
    a few trips to Prague too and it&#39;s pretty but much smaller. And Vienna was
    good looking but oh so boring. one day I&#39;ll visit Krakow too. <BR>cheers
