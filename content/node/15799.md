  a great ressource for everybody involved in type. My name is David Pache, Im a multimedia
  designer in Switzerland. Its time I get my company, Dache, off the ground. I do
  identities, newmedia, illustrations and webdesign. After months and months of research
  (finding your own logo is one of the hardest things to do) I beleave I have found
  it.\r\n\r\nI created the name that goes with my logo using the same shapes and dimensions.
  I would really like some crits and comments from you if you would be so kind. Id
  appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDavid Pache\r\n\r\nwww.dache.ch"

    There are other good examples od "D" possible. I stand for the same problem to

    to create something unique.'

  body: The mark is to big compared to the type. I looks like a symbol for a gas company
    tilted right. I'm a designer and can't figure out what its supposed to mean. Its
    not bad it just has no meaning (to me), so its art for art sake. Thats not bad,
    you are an artist, but as a clear communication business symbol its weak.

  body: "The mark is probably doing what you want: it looks contemporary and kind
    of technology-ish, it's dynamic, it's familiar but not completely so, etc. However,
    if you want to really make an impact in people's minds, this isn't the mark for
    you. No one's going to say: \"Remember the guy with the grey and orange logo?
    The one that looks kind of like Quark's?\" Your mark reminds me of other things,
    rather than sparking something unique in my mind. However, having a site of content
    up for people to associate with your logo will help overcome that. \r\n\r\nAgain,
    the logo isn't necessarily wrong or bad (it fits some of your goals, is pretty
    well crafted, and has a consistent visual theme), but I just don't think it's
    giving you the mileage you deserve from a personal logo. It feels too 'already
    seen it' to me. If you're going to take the time and effort to design a mark,
    and not just a nice logotype, then you should probably push it past this into
    something even more unique.\r\n\r\nAs for the type forms, I'd like to see some
    larger examples of the characters. The 'e' and the curve-to-straight transitions
    on the 'd' don't look smooth enough to me, but that may just be the anti-aliasing
    at that size. Also, I agree with bj's assessment. The type feels too thin next
    to the mark. Perhaps its stroke weight should match the outer rule, rather than
    the inner one."

    typograph has created (I was thinking Frutiger) but I really like my shape, its
    a little tough to \"surrender\" it because some large company has something similar,
    after me. My logo has multiple meanings for me. I am thinking about using a circular
    shape instead though. Or rotate it some, but then it will look like a raindrop.\r\nI've
    thought about it, but I wonder what you guys think. Is Quark really all that known
    by people who arent in the visual department anyway?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDavid

  body: David, here are my comments... I think the icon is appealing, but people will
    inevitably ask "what does it mean". This is a problem, because logos shouldn't
    explain, but identify. With generic shapes like this the more likely it is to
    remind someone of something they've seen before. The icon will have different
    meanings to different people, and some may have a negative reaction to it, sperm,
    egg, etc. Personally I don't think it is strong enough or distinctive enough to
    stand alone and your application of it, and use of type, will make all the difference.
    This is a piece of your overall identity, and once you have some of the other
    "pieces" in place you'll be better able to judge whether this is working or not.
    Best of luck, it is always hardest to do your own identity. Mine has been "coming
    soon" for 5 years!

    sit so nicely; the graphic mark is interesting, so I'd look for a typeface that
    doesn't compete for attention with it - hence I'm not too keen on the custom typeface.
    I know you might think that Helvetica would be a clich\xE9... but I think it's
    made for your project.\r\n\r\nI think that the type and the logo need to balance
    up more; the logo is solid and compact, I think a typeface that reflects that
    characteristic would work really well, if you decide against Helvetica. I'm unsure
    about Frutiger because the logo is very geometric, to me the curves of the Frutiger
    typeface stand out.\r\n\r\nThat's my 2 pence!\r\n\r\nSi\r\n"
