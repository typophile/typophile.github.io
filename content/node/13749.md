  body: "Penned forms in a loose \"Carolingian\" style are so hard to exactly match
    since they've grown like weeds in so many \"freebie\" font sites.\r\n\r\nExcept
    for the cap \"R\" you can come close to replicating the sample with <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/previews/publius.jpg\"
    target=\"new\">Publius</a> if you \"embold\" and extend the characters.\r\n\r\nSorry,
    that's all I could find.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\nYes, I'm
    old, but I'm back in style!"

    it's a fairly inexpensive font to boot.  Many thanks!\r\n\r\nBill B"
