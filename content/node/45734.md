  a particular problem I'm running into which I haven't been able to solve, so I thought
  let's see if anyone here can help me with this.\r\n\r\nIn the attached picture you
  see a lowercase g with another master behind it.\r\nNotice that a few points of
  the master in the background are being cast into space.\r\nI have compared pointstructures,
  starting points, contour direction and the glyphs seem to be identical.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArtur\r\n"

    the mask that is supposed to become the other master? Or is it actually the other
    master, so you already have an MM font? In that case, did that accident happen
    when it was already an MM font, or did something go wrong in the moment you built
    the MM font (out of two single master fonts)? In that case, how did you build
    the MM font? \"Manually\" with Mask to Master or with the built-in automatism
    (that never really works)?\r\n"

  body: "Ah, I see. I hadn't thought of that possibility to build an MM font. Just
    out of curiosity: does the g also get messed up if you use Mask to Master instead
    of Assign Master? I always use the former method but it's not much different,
    actually.\r\n\r\nIf it's only a very small number of glyphs that gets messed up
    then you could fix that quite quickly by putting the bold master into the mask
    of the MM font (using Assign Mask) and then manually shift the nodes of the bold
    master back where they belong. Should only take a minute."

  body: "Cool, that last suggestion worked actually! Well, I didn't maunually shift
    nodes, but I copied the contours of g from the source font and pasted them into
    the mask layer of the bold master in the MM font, then I used the Mask to Master
    command.\r\n\r\nSo what I understand from this is that it is better to first assign
    a source font as a mask to an MM font, and then use the Mask to Master command.\r\n\r\nAnd
    all this only to use your wonderful RMX tools Tim! ;)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArtur"

  body: "Artur,\r\n\r\nI see by your example, that your g is made up of three separate
    pieces. May I suggest that you try to interpolate as many characters as possible
    as whole glyphs, and not rely on this piece-together approach. \r\n\r\nWith your
    current approach once you have all your instances generated, you are still going
    to have a lot of \"remove overlap\" work to do. Wouldn't you agree that touching
    up two g glyphs is more efficient that touching up 6, 8 or 12?\r\n\r\nAnd I agree
    that Tim's RMX tools are terrific!\r\n\r\nJamesM"

  body: "One thing that bugs me is that FLS has a problem with removing overlaps in
    some cases like an 'A': FLS seems to expect that in this case, both the 'arrow'
    and the 'dash' outlines follow the same direction -- but FLS's own function for
    setting outline directions to 'PS' turns one counter-clockwise, the other clockwise.
    Then removing overlaps fails. It is not safe to correct path direction and remove
    overlaps automatically. In so far I never trusted the last-minute removal of overlaps,
    but envy everyone who does it successfully.\r\n(I really don't want to care for
    outline directions manually ...)\r\n\r\nKarsten\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There are definitely cases when keeping a glyph as separate parts has advantages
    when using multiple masters. A good example is a Q in which the tail crosses the
    bowl at an angle. When you go from the lightest to the boldest weight, you want
    the intersection of the tail and the bowl to follow the curve of the bowl. If
    you remove overlaps before interpolating, the intersection will follow a straight
    line between the two extremes, rather than the curve of the bowl:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/QvsQ_6394.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    Q on the left was interpolated from separate parts; the Q on the right was interpolated
    from a continuous outline. Note the distortion in the area where the tail intersects
    the bowl.\r\n\r\nIn fact, anytime there is a change of angle or rotation between
    the extremes, you're going to have interpolation problems. There isn't always
    an adequate solution, but in some cases, having separate parts helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    it isn't. But if you do one manually, then you can safely do the other automatically.
    I personally prefer to do direction manually and remove overlaps automatically
    (since removing overlaps by hand is tricky, and maintaining direction is not).\r\n\r\nApparently
    the AFDKO does both, and correctly. I don't see how this can work always: I assume
    that it uses heuristics, and mostly guesses right. I'd be curious as to what that
    heuristic is, if it isn't an Adobe trade secret."

    another collegue made this point during a chat today. Still I'd prefer it if FLS
    would do the right thing automatically. A designer really shouldn't need to bother
    about path directions or closepaths or things like that, these are technical issues
    on the level of the font format to be generated. But I repeat myself, sorry."

    that it's ambiguous. How does a program know how to resolve that ambiguity?"
