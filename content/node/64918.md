body: "I really dig this Mercedes Benz logo type c. 1902. Does a type which resembles
  this one exist? Also (and I apologize for the ignorance)is there a way to distort
  the type (Like the [M] in the logo) without having to rasterize? \r\nThanks for
  your help.\r\n-A young and naive type enthusiast. "

    the M, R and S, it comes close to a Univers Condensed or Ultra Condensed.\r\n\r\nCheck
