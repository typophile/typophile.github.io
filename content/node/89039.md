body: "Is there any info about this character (U+0387)? Is said that is used in Greek
  as an equivalent to the semi-colon in Latin languages (while in Greek, semi-colon
  works as a question mark). Unicode poorly make it a compatibility decomposition
  to the Middle dot character (U+00B7), even though is frequently said that the character
  is \"sightly above\" the x-height, yet I haven't found enough reference. For a while
  I thought that a ongoing accepted Unicode proposal for the character 'raised dot'
  was a replacement, but it is actually a dot that resides <em>between</em> the x-height
  and the baseline, for use in Greek and Coptic too.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Is the symbol
  (Ano teleia) actually used?</li>\r\n<li>Are there any kind of guide of how to design
  it?</li>\r\n<li>Is there any solution to the \"compatibility decomposition\" issue
  for the future?</li>\r\n</ul>"

  body: "Yes, it is used. I usually align the default ano teleia to the top dot of
    : and ;. I also provide an all-cap variant aligned to the cap height (OTL 'case'
    feature') and a smallcap variant aligned to the smallcap height (OTL 'smcp' feature).\r\n\r\nYou
    can handle the compatibility mapping issue by providing an OTL 'locl' feature
    mapping from the period centred glyph to the ano teleia glyph in the Greek script
    and language system."

  body: "Thanks!\r\nRegarding the OTL 'locl' feature, the actual 'middle dot' isn't
    used anywhere in Greek text? I believe the only intended use in Latin alphabet
    is as a separator between two 'l' from different syllables in Catalan, yet some
    people also use it as multiplication sign (even though there's a separate character
    for that)."
