    a long, long time. Can't blame computer geeks for that. That is quite different
    from playfully replacing certain letters with numbers, which was my point in mentioning
    rebuses and the like. As for giggles, she did not get flak only on account of
    her poor grammar -- she received other criticisms too, which she chose to ignore
    in her replies."
