body: "Hi everyone, i have kind of a straight forward question concerning the first
  line left indent function in indesign...is there like a golden rule in how much
  \"mm\" (mine is set to mm) a first line left indent at the beginning of each paragraph
  should be in comparison to the font size and/or leading used in a document?\r\n\r\nFor
  example i'm using a typeface (Mercury) at 10pt and the leading is 12,7pt, should
  i set the left indent according to the font size or is it just all a matter of whatever
  works best for you?\r\n\r\nAll help is appreciated"
