  I posted about my MA research which looks into Online Design Archives and whether
  there is a place for one to help with teaching and learning, but also to act as
  an archive for typography. Following from this I have built a survey to obtain some
  quantitative data in regards to the subject.\r\n\r\nIf you have the time, the survey
  is 7 questions long, will take you about 2 minutes and your input and responses
  would be greatly appreciated, as the data I collect will affect how I will develop
  this tool.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=N6kVPo7ZiXXJYFt6Rn96Jg_3d_3d\">click
  to take this survey</a>\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your time, and if you know of anyone
  that you could pass this on to then it would also be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  again.\r\n\r\nChris"
