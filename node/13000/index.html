		<div class="commentbody"><p>jlt, sadly these reports are true, I knew Rick since I was barely able to walk. He was one of my dad&rsquo;s best friends, and in the last few months my father (Thom Marchionna) had been helping Rick out in trying to help him with work and his personal issues. Rick was one of those guys who I looked up to as a kid and still do, he was and still is the funniest and smartest men I&rsquo;ve ever had the honor of knowing.</p>
<p>Rick had been fighting depression due to his health, and while I know the details of what happened I feel it inappropriate to mention them here.</p>
<p>However please contact me at <a href="mailto:isaac@lawndartdesign.com">isaac@lawndartdesign.com</a>. I feel it important that his friends honor Rick as the amazingly talented, smart, and funny man he was, rather then what his illness had made him become. A great human being I hope wherever he his he&rsquo;s at peace.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Rick was a great friend.  I have known him since our 2nd year at Miami University in 1971.  We shared a house in our last year there.  When I went to Australia in 1975 his was one the hardest goodbyes I had to make.  He was smart, witty and extremely fun to be around.  I have spent most of the years inbetween in Australia so haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of him since then.  We kept in touch and I followed his career in what ever way I could.  Those of you who know him will agree that he was a brilliant graphic designer.  Not just in an artistic sense, but also in the wit and fun he incorporated in all his work.  I miss him enormously.  Yes he was a great human being.  I too hope that he is at peace.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rick Tharp’s Body Found 
Positive identification was made last night July 18th after the Contra Costa Coroner’s office finished dental DNA testing. 
Ricks body was found July 7th. Family members were not contacted until the news article came out in the Contra Costa times on July 15th and was spotted by a friend, who kindly called. Rick Tharp’s request to be cremated can now be carried out. 
The Article in the Contra Costa News reads: 
Coroner&rsquo;s deputies are asking for the public&rsquo;s help in identifying a body found floating in the San Francisco Bay. 
The Yerba Buena Coast Guard recovered the body of a man south of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, west of the Richmond Shoreline near Red Rock on July 7, according to a press release. 
The remains were turned over to the Contra Costa Coroner&rsquo;s Office at the Richmond Marina. 
An autopsy determined the man died of multiple blunt force trauma consistent with a fall from a bridge or other high structure, the coroner&rsquo;s office said. 
The coroner believes the body was in the water for about a month, making fingerprint identification impossible. Dental and DNA results are pending. 
The victim was described as white or Latino and approximately 5-feet-8-inches tall. He was wearing Calvin Klein briefs with white-trim and black-and-gray Nike gym shoes without socks.
