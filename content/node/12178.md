  word \"Typostammtisch\" is German, and has no good English translation. Basically,
  it means \"a regular meeting at a bar, during which typography will be discussed.\"
  Currently, there are several Typostammtische in Germany.\r\n\r\nAlthough various
  chapters of German Forum Typografie may have informally used in the term for some
  of their meetings, it is held that the first regular Typostammtisch was established
  in Offenbach, a Hessian city near Frankfurt. The Offenbach Typostammtisch was founded
  by [[TypeOff]] in the aftermath of TYPO Berlin 2004, and has been meeting regularly
  since June 2004. Since 2007, the Offenbach Typostammtisch has been organized by
  the Offenbach design studio TYPOSITION. Dates and locations are published on the
  <em>spatium Magazin</em> blog, http://www.spatium-magazin.de\r\n\r\nThe Offenbach
  Typostammtisch has inspired additional Typostammtische in Germany. For several years,
  a Berlin Typostammtisch, organized by Fontwerk (http://www.fontwerk.com), has met
  every other month. The Berlin Typostammtisch has the highest attendance of any Typostammtisch
  in the country.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, a Typostammtisch was founded in Saarbr\xFCcken.
  This Typostammtisch meets irregularly. In 2010, a monthly Typostammtisch was founded
  in Hamburg. There are additional Typostammtische in Cologne and Hannover, the later
  of which is run by a chapter of the Forum Typografie.\r\n\r\nTypostammtische on
