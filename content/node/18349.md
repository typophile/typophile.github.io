    think that would relax the look a bit and perhaps personalize it a bit more. \r\n\r\nIt
    seems that your 5-col is full-just and your 4-col is ragged. Which are you leaning
    toward?\r\n\r\nAre you going to use a sans serif for the body? \r\n\r\nI might
    consider a friendly headline font. "

  body: "It would be easier to tell if you posted pdfs. But to me the current headline
    font looks rather light and spacy, you could look at a heavier version (it doesn't
    look like Minion to me though). Utopia has a headline weight.\r\nIt is okay to
    have uneven columns, for example four of one width and one narrower, or three
    and two (not each different) but I don't think that 12\" will support five equal
    width columns. I would make the images fall on the grid as well, have you got
    horizontal as well as vertical gridlines? What are your outside margins?\r\nI
    would choose a font and size and work out your measure on an average width of
    40-50 characters (including spaces) and then make decisions on the number of columns
    and gutters.\r\nTim"

  body: "More questions I'm afraid, is that the maximum amount of copy you expect
    for the front page? You need to be realistic about the average amount because
    you will find yourself compromising your design from the outset, take the front
    page of the past editions and try to work it into your new layout. \r\nThe area
    above the nameplate seems too large for my taste and the gutter is a touch too
    wide. Closer inspection shows you have inch and foot marks standing in for apostrophes
    and quote marks, no fi fl ligatures, the drop cap on the hate story is clashing
    with the copy, in the Swann story the columns are starting from different points.
    I preferred the uppercase nameplate you showed in your first post about redesigning,
    the small caps version is not as engaging. Elements I would start with are: 1.
    make the story area larger by reducing the area above the nameplate (whose name
    escapes me) and the index area at the bottom of the page; 2. bring the stories
    closer to the byline, reduce the size of the byline and keeping those distances
    consistent throughout 3. experimenting without the boxed story area, try vertical
    rules to separate stories or doing without them if the picture covers the width
    of the columns the stories should appear separated anyway.\r\nI hope I am not
    being too negative on the layout, there are some positive developments but it
    does need refining. \r\nTim"

      NO advice.  If you're gonna spend the time telling him what you didn't like,
      maybe explain WHY you don't like it and offer some suggestions as to how YOUR
      way is the best way. I have no problems with critiquing someone's work, but
      at least give him some insight other than "nice try" or "bad layout".

  body: "It's coming along.\r\n\r\nI would recommend tightening up the layouts by
    using more rules to demarcate articles, especially between editorial and advertising
    matter, and above all your headlines.\r\nThe rules will also help organize your
    white space.\r\nThe rules should go close to the text, as you have done in many
    instances: be consistent.\r\n(think of it as the fine tolerance with which a door/trunk
    closes on a well-enginerered car.)\r\nDon't use the same fine rules inside an
    article, certainly not next to the bylines, this is a terribly confusing idea:
    the design system says \"fine rules at edge of articles\".\r\nFor the callouts,
    if you must use rules, use a different, thicker rule."

  body: I know you may be asking specifically about gutters here, but I think that
    the type is contributing to the unfriendly feel. I think you need to work another
    typeface in to the design. A nice sans serif like Gotham will friendly it up.
    The type is looking too bland to me. Also mix up your bold and regular weights
    - for instance on front page - on the "It's Art Right?" section, don't bold the
    subheading, maybe an italic for the subhead, or a sans serif typeface. A couple
    other things... page numbers at the bottom are too large, I would make them flush
    left with the description. I think the body copy needs another point of leading.
    The rule inbetween the two top articles should end flush with the top of the photo.
    Ending your rules in strange places will make them stand out.

    so to speak. Our local newspaper (the Daily Pennsylvanian) has just responded
    to us by adding a digest for the first time in some 125 years, which is pretty
    cool.\r\n\r\nMy questions:\r\n\r\n(1) Rules: More rules? Does that mean all the
    way up next to the headline too? When do you thick vs. thin rules? How much gutter
    is too much gutter?\r\n\r\n(2) What are callouts? And why would I use a thicker
    rule?\r\n\r\n(3) What's \"another point of leading\"? You mean from 11.7 (where
    it is now) to 12.7 for the 11pt. font?\r\n\r\n(4) On mixed weights, new body font:
    point well taken. Any other suggestions besides Gotham I should look at?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "1. Don't be afraid of rules. Look at the way newspapers use fine rules to
    separate articles. Vertical rules extend to the top of the headline cap height,
    or up to the horizontal rule above. Choose a paper you think has a good, consistent
    use of rules and gutters, and follow its style for these. \r\n\r\n2. Callouts
    aka breakouts. Use a thicker rule because the \"rule\" about the fine rule is
    that it marks the boundary between articles, therefore to have it appear elsewhere
    is confusing to the reader. Page layout is all about hierarchy, and visual differences
    should signify hierarchical differences, if they don't, they are meaningless.
    Conversely, visual similarities should signal hierarchical equivalence, if they
    don't, they too are meaningless. \r\n\r\nSo, it would be useful to have all boundaries
    between articles marked by a rule. Of course, it is possible to do it differently,
    but I would not recommend it unless you are a more experienced designer. Right
    now, for you, a \"safe\" use of rules between articles would give you the best
    results. "
