  link goes to Amazon to the author's novel \"The Prisoner of Heaven\". You can click
  on the image and zoom in to get a clear view of it. \r\n\r\nThe font I want to idenify
  is the author's name \"Carlos Ruiz Zafon\" on the top of the cover. \r\n\r\nThis
  font also appears on the back cover used for the author's name as well as the names
  under each quote. \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated! I need to figure this font
  out for a paper for class. I tried myfonts.com with the whatthefont app on my iphone
  but it did not work. I also tried their forum but no one replied.\r\n\r\nThank you! "
