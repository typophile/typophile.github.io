  color sugestions?\r\nAny critique is welcome.\r\n\r\nI havnt studied color options
  yet and the logo's for a friends it and networks solutions company. \r\nIts more
  or less a restyling where the only element of relevance on the old logo was a perfect
  triangle.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fx_5507.jpg]"

    this point ... might need to be scaled down a bit?\r\n\r\naside fromt he S looking
    a bit weird the US kerning could use some work too<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

    you noticed but theres 3 more options to the left where the symbol's a lil bit
    scaled down and in different positions.\r\n\r\nThanks once again\r\n\r\n"

  body: In the 4th version the mark looks like a "play" button. Not sure if it's intentional.

    like th reversed version ... it makes the type seem more robust.<br />\r\n<br

  body: "The dark-on-light version of #3 is my favourite. The only thing I'd say about
    it is that the icon seems a little too far out to the right and isn't quite 'connected'
    with the type. In the other 3, the icon seems to compete with and over-balance
    the type. \r\n\r\nThoughts on Type: http://www.sthursby.com/blog"

  body: "Sorry for not posting an update yesterday but Im full of work.\r\nProlly
    won't have the time until the weekend. However by then I'll try to get it done
    since its a friend's work.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have few doubts / questions. I like
    the type direction I'm taking. Even less confortable with the S after Paul pointed
    out. \r\nI'd appreciate if anyone who knows squarish fonts could post squarish
    S examples or tell me the font names so I can have an idea of what can be done
    for that matter. \r\n\r\nAbout the symbol, theres not much concept to support
    it besides the fact that the company works on networks (therefore the triangulation
    geometry/lines work well) and had a triangle on previous logo.\r\nDo you think
    I should take another direction (I've had a few before but none as solid), tweak
    it, redraw it? \r\n\r\nSuggestions on the positioning. As it is with the 4 versions
    I have I like n\xBA 2 the most. Less static, and with a nice scale. However its
    still not there, and Im kinda stuck at this point.\r\n\r\n"

    :-P\r\n\r\nalso, sorry for throwing doubt.\r\n\r\nI still think v3's relative
    scale and positioning are more balanced ... but I'm also interested in hearing
    more thoughts on it.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul
