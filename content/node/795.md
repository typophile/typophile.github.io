body: Hi all...I&#39;m looking for the identification of the font posted below.  Any
  suggestions?  Actually, there&#39;s a similar font that seems more graffiti-esque
  used in the title of MTV&#39;s &#34;Who&#39;s Got Game&#34; series intro &#40;yes,
  I&#39;m lame&#41;...the name of that font would be highly appreciated!  Thanks for
  your help, you&#39;re all superhuman as far as I&#39;m concerned!   <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: My pleasure -- I couldn&#39;t find the graffiti font quickly, and I can&#39;t
    do any more today, but I&#39;m sure it &#40;or something very similar&#41; can
    be found. Check dafont.com -- their logo is graffiti-ish, so they should have
    at least one like that, and theirs are usually free over there...
