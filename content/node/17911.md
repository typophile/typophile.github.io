    corn flour and cheese powder must be marketed as Extreme Global Digital Wireless
    Broadband Streaming Ringtone Technology! Remember what a Doritos bag looked like
    four or five redesigns ago? Irregular quadrilaterals behind each letter, alternating
    orange and yellow? You wouldn't have confused that with an MP3 player, now would
    you.

  body: "In the US potato chip bag colors have changed a bit over the years but generally
    are Yellow for plain/salted, Brown to Black for BBQ, Cyan Blue for Salt and vinagar,
    and Orange for Cheese flavors. Of course there are zillions of other flavors,
    but those are the most common and long standing on potato chips in the US. Most
    other American chip companies seem to follow the lead of Frito Lay when it comes
    to the colors used on chip bags.\r\n\r\nCerulean - I like that old Dorito bag
    too, everything since is just too...\r\n\r\nGeoff - Chicken flavors? On chips?
    Salt and Vinagar used to be represented by a Yellow-green, but it has recientlly
    changed to Cyan Blue, I think they needed Green for the Dill Pickle chip bag.
    I do think colours are localised, as well as spellings and tastes. Check out these:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IndiaChips.png]\r\nYes,
    those are real! Chatpata Chaska flovored Kurkure (tasted like Cilantro/Coriander
    on a Cheeto-like substrate) and Magic Masala flavored Lays. No BBQ or meat flavors

    KP, Smiths) which were near identical, followed this scheme.\r\n\r\nThen Walkers
    swiftly rose to the top, the other brands disappeared or reappeared as \"USP\"

    here in Australia, particularly potato chip brands and quickie-snack products
    found in supermarket freezer aisles. So I guess this dubious style isn't uniquely
    American.\r\n\r\nFor about the last 2 years there has been a lot of twaddle from
    brand managers I work with about brand positioning and re-positioning, niche consumer
    appeal and \"leveraging\" consumer products. It translates into lots of pointless
    and stoopid packaging redesigns.\r\n\r\nQuite possibly the font used on the new
    Walkers package is an attempt to differentiate the brand from other potato chip
    brands that use a flair serif (as the previous Walkers pack did). Flair serifs
    are common on chip packets.\r\n\r\nThat, however, doesn't excuse the awful new
