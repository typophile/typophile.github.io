body: "Hi Everyone,\r\nIve finally came up with my final major project idea which
  is to use poems by young poets in a typography magazine called Imprint (name = maybe)
  The idea behind it being to entice and excite young people 11-17 to dabble at doing
  poetry ( such as the foyles young poets of the year award) What i have asked for
  help about is this. Apart from the foyles young poet competion winners i am unable
  to find any other poems by young people and only if you have come across any (if
  there are any poet enthusiasts out their) could you send a web link or if its a
  book with young poets in it a name would be great. Also the style of the magazine
  is to obvisully be creative with type but to be clever about the choice of materials
  / visual style used to make sure that the magazine represents the poems selected
  in much more than words so creative typography is a must such as a few bits of work
  from non-format and others if you have any other great inspirational peices like
  the links that would be amazing too! :)(links down the page) A part from the young
  people poems help could i also bother you further in you opinion of my final major
  project idea. Do you reakon it sounds intresting? can u see a flaw in it? have you
  done something similier and found hidden complications?\r\n\r\nAny help is really
  great and i would apreciate it massivly :)\r\n\r\nThank you everyone\r\n\r\nKarl\r\n\r\nhttp://www.non-format.com/images/1160564938.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.non-format.com/images/1127998969.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.non-format.com/images/1125509313.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.non-format.com/images/1087992452.jpg\r\n\r\nActually
  if any of you have any links to exrpessive or clever editorial design that would
  just be the cherry on the top for help :)"

  body: "I'm not sure I understand what you want to do. I don't think it would be
    ok for you to just surf the night and grab any poems by young people you can find.
    You ought to ask permission to include these poems. You might want to post somewhere
    online or in your community, local schools, etc.. that you are accepting submissions
    and what the magazines goals are. \r\n\r\nBut permission to print people's poems
    is a definite must.\r\n\r\nK."
