body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nI'm designing a print publication for a large Indian conglomerate
  which is involved in heavy manufacturing, service industries and FMCG's. The title
  is to introduce their brand(s) to the European market, and will be akin to Monocle
  in it's ideology and breadth.\r\n\r\nI had in mind a font superfamily to bring harmony
  to the various strands of content and wanted something classic but fresh and contemporary
  and also future-proof.\r\n\r\nI have been looking at Freight, but the cost is prohibitive
  especially as I can't test the font in the design and present to the client.\r\nCan
  anyone suggest a similar hard-working family or any other thoughts/recommendations?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
