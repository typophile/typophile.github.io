  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm planning to use Warnock Pro as the text face for a book. However, I need a sans that will work well with it. The trouble is, the obvious options fail on one or more of the necessary criteria.
1. It has to have small caps and maybe also an italic (or oblique)
2. It has to have Greek, or at least there has to be a Greek face that's similar enough I can drop a word or two of Greek caps or small caps into the same line of text as Latin caps or small caps. Monotonic Greek should suffice. Cyrillic isn't absolutely necessary, but it might not hurt. (The Greek requirement is also limiting my options for the text face.)
3. It needs to be reasonably sturdy for good color when set amidst 10.5/13 Warnock Pro Regular.

At the moment the best I've come up with is Hypatia, but the lack of italics may be a problem.

The book has to do with twentieth-century sculpture (everything from Beaux-Arts in the early decades through Art Deco to some more contemporary styles in the 1980s and early 1990s).

Any ideas?</div>

Same issue with the ClearType fonts, although I suppose Candara might do if I were to fiddle with the setting. Informa may be a possibility. Perhaps Underground also, although again it might get along better with a different text face.

Maybe I need to reconsider the Warnock part of it. Something more bland would be a lot easier to match.</div>

I couldn't say without setting comparative mixed text. Stylistically, the choice of "g" with either one or two bowls gives you some leeway. Similarly there is a plain (geometric) Greek and a stylistic alternative, more "scripty".

Warnock and Figgins are not equivalent in vertical metrics.
I don't have Warnock on my computer, so was not able to compare x-height, which is a crucial factor for mixed text, but it's not critical for x-height to be identical. I decided against that for the Modern Suite, finding that a Regular weight sans serif looks bigger than a serifed face of the same x-height. 

Would you like to try it out?

		<div class="commentbody">Nick: Yes, I'd be interested to try it out. I did try MT Grotesque, which is the closest design I have to Figgins, and in some respects it worked well but the overall effect was kind of odd - partly vertical metrics (though this worked better if I set the Grot about 10% smaller) and partly spacing. From what I've seen in your specimen PDF I'd expect Figgins to work considerably better, though, and it certainly has all the features I need for this project.

		<div class="commentbody">David, I would recommend that you pair Warnock with a humanist sans. 

A number of intriguing possibilities suggest themselves, but the single best pairing for Warnock I can think of that has everything you require is [[http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-84-anselm-sans-pro|Anselm Sans Pro]] (cf. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/anselm-sans/regular/|My Fonts]]) from the Storm Type Foundry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If the text face and its sans companion need to be mixed on the same line, in lieu of matching color and x-height, you may simply choose a single super-family such as the aforementioned Anselm Pro (a useful reinterpretation of the types of Jean Jannon). The exact relationship between the sans and the serif all depends on how intimately they are combined.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Christopher. I guess I had been thinking of something with geometric tendencies due to the Art Deco-era inscriptional lettering that will be in many of the illustrations, but in terms of the type itself, I like the look of Anselm Sans. The Anselm superfamily as a whole is probably not viable for this job based on the client's objections to other text faces I had considered, but the sans looks like something that has a reasonably good chance of surviving the three or four people there who will have something to say about the design. The weight looks good, and I think the lack of Greek small caps will not be a problem, based on the portion of the manuscript I've worked on so far.</div>

Re: Myriad: ironically, that's where I started from, until I discovered that I was going to need some small caps to represent properly what the author was trying to do. I also quite like its Greek, and in fact once added a koppa, a lunate epsilon, and a few other glyphs to it for a client....</div>
