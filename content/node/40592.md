  quick primer on typefaces: They are divided into two main groups - serif and sans

    design and use it.

    up finding\r\nthe wonderful work of Dan Milne\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/14576\r\n\r\nthen
    realized it was 4 a.m. (zzz)\r\n\r\nLooks like they did update it for their print
    version \u2014 Milne is a revised version of Olympian used\r\nin the Inquirer."

    if they DID know something about the subject, or made the assumption that a significant
    number of their readers might perhaps be better informed than they are.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    it's because there is an assumption that the ignorance of writers on the subject
    is shared by the general populace, it being  inconceivable to writers, who work
    with fonts all the time, that others would be more knowledgable. However, most
    writers are not \"visual\" people."

    of the articles I read about typography come from people well-versed in the subject.\r\n\r\nPrint,
    How, STEP, Baseline, eye, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd when the New Yorker or NYT does something,
    it's typically thoughtful, and well-researched.\r\n\r\nseeing the opposite is
    a bit of an eye opener.\r\n\r\n"

    mainstream = general media, not trade.\r\nOf course trade press writers, such
    as Allan Haley and John D. Berry, know their stuff! \r\n\r\n<em>well-researched.</em>\r\n\r\nWhenever
    I've been interviewed by mainstream media, the reporter has never done any homework
    and starts from scratch, and while the stories may be professional, they are stodgy
    with background. For instance, last year, in response to a press release I sent
    out for a new typeface, a newspaper reporter devoted less than 20% of the resulting
    article to the typeface, with the rest devoted to a potted history of digital
    fonts. Fortunately, she didn't mention good old bancomicsans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> the reporter has never done any homework and starts from scratch\r\n\r\nNot
    surprising. I spent nearly 10 years as a newspaper reporter, and you were expected
    to produce from 3 to 5 stories a day. This was at smaller papers. For the Bee,
    I suspect this story was one day's work, perhaps with a few smaller stories put
    in.\r\n\r\nThe author was probably aiming the article at the general reader (you
    know, grade 10 reading level and all) and not the trade. I didn't see any glaring
    errors, which is a step above most.\r\n\r\nI consider it a good article (not great)
    in that it gets the word out about type, and it had a nice plug for Helvetica
    (the movie)."
