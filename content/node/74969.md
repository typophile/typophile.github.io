  body: "thanks lex. you are right, could be hand-lettering.\r\ni totally forgot to
    mention that the photo i got it from was pretty much distorted.\r\nhence i tried
    to \"optimize\" it a little that might have altered the characters a bit.\r\nanyway,
    i am also interested in fonts that have a similar expression \u2013 like gillies
    for example.\r\n"
