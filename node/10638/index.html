		<div class="commentbody">These are very interesting, Hrant. I can certainly see the great disparity in gain between the heavy inking on antique paper of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Emblems<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the finer impression on calendared paper from Big Red. All I can say at this point is that I would also not specify Linotype metal Electra for a book to be printed on very smooth paper &ndash; it was obviously possible for the original Electra to be too dazzling also. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slight tangent: Here is an interesting early statement from Dwiggins, from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Layout in Advertising<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (1928):  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;But as a matter of fact, printing type on antique-surfaced paper seems to be something of a stumbling-block to the modern craft. The fine points of the time-honored process have been forgotten in learning (and learning very thoroughly) an entirely different trade &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->viz.,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the trade of printing half-tones. . . . If [the designer] is a stickler for good workmanship, he will demand more impression than is compatible with the ideals of most pressmen; and an inking &ndash; and an ink &ndash; that will leave crisp, solid inlays with sharp edges printed from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->face<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the type, not from its shoulder.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have no personal experience printing letterpress, so I am not sure what to make of this declaration. Gerald may find it provocative. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He goes on in this section to say that Antique and English Finish (what we would probably call Vellum and Wove today) are &quot;essentially <!-- raw HTML omitted -->type<!-- raw HTML omitted --> surfaces,&quot; while Machine Finish and Sized &amp; Super-calendered (Smooth and Super-Smooth or Plate) are &quot;general utility <!-- raw HTML omitted -->half-tone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> papers.&quot; And then: &quot;It is interesting to note how the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->picture,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> exclusively, has set the pace in all this career after smoother surfaces. Type has had to trail along as best it could.&quot; [all WAD's italics] <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He also mentions briefly the development of coated papers as the current evolution in this search for ever greater polish and smoothness. He concludes the section with &quot;The problem of assembling type and pictures on half-tone papers has not yet begun to be solved. The solution waits, first, for new styles of type letters; and after that for a sharp break with the traditions of the past.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't say for certain what he might have meant exactly, but Hrant, I thought you'd find this last statement fascinating. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suppose it would be reasonable to assume that Electra (begun a few years later) represented some of Dwiggins's thoughts along the lines of a new style of type letters for printing on half-tone papers, which lends credence to the thrust of Gerald's arguments, as I understand them. If this was part of Dwiggins's goal, then I confess that I am ambivalent about his success toward this particular end. Sharpness? certainly; Lightness? maybe; High contrast? no. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is interesting to note, however, that Dwiggins himself (as far as I know) did not specify any jobs to be printed with Electra on machine finish or s&amp;sc papers &ndash; continuing to prefer antique and english finished stocks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suspect this may very well be a key to Electra. With the standardization of photoengraving in the very late nineteenth century the problem of the photograph was of great concern. With the letterpress process, halftones cannot be printed the same as type. They need a very smooth and unresilient paper. Any kind of overinking and the tonal quality is lost. Impression has to be exactingly uniform and quite light compared to type. Beatrice Warde's study concerning the differences between the letterpress process and the offset process on various kinds of substrates would also be revealing here. Many of the old standby typefaces did not perform well on the kind of paper required for halftones.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One other thing here that may or may not shed some light&hellip; It would probably have been quite rare for bookwork to have been printed directly from the Linotype castings. I doubt Big Red was printed from the castings. Linotype metal and Monotype metal were far too soft to withstand such repeated impression. Monotype, in fact, was not initially intended for printing. At the time, these casting processes were used for the initial composition. Once proofed and okayed, a paper mould of the form would be made and from this a stereotype was cast. The printing would be done from the stereotype. At a later point (when stereotype fell out of practice), or in less moneyied shops, they would probably have just taken a proof and made a copper photoengraving and would have printed from this. I would suspect you would see more of a bolder character from any printing done directly from the Linotype metal, which would grow bolder (or conversely, weaker, with heavier inking to compensate) as the metal face wore down during the printing process.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think Electra probably is a bit fragile and spindly as it was possibly intended this way. I can't say why that would be. You would know more than I. But compared to other faces at the time I would say yes, but also compared to other faces that were quite &quot;light&quot; in color, such as Centaur, it seems to have a bit of strength built in to it. Centaur, printed direct from the Monotype, self destructs very quickly. I doubt Electra would. I noticed something else about its quirkiness. That lowercase g, for instance, seems to have ink &quot;supports&quot; built in to it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I only have a photocopy of the Bowater. Someone on TYPO-L a while back had a couple of extra copies but I didn't get a reply when I posted about it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't say whether or not the Anthoensen Press would have been printed directly from the metal. It would certainly have been cheaper to do so and those are not long enough runs to have damaged the metal much. I noticed in the issue of the Colophon that Hrant showed me and that was put up here, that there was metal flashing between some of the characters. Flashing is a leakage between the matrices as the result of dirt or misalignment. I'd &quot;suspect&quot; then that this printing, in particular, was printed from the metal.</div>

That a face needed to be thinner to work well with halftones. Photographs have a great deal of tonal range! My photo students like Optima and Univers (in the thinner versions) best for captions etc because they are much less interfering in terms of weight (among their other qualities). The opposite would be printing with wood engravings which carry a tremendous amount of weight. There you would need a fairly heavy face.

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Okay, what you say makes sense. Dwiggins argued throughout his career in favor of engraved illustrations (rather than photos or halftoned illustrations) as the best complement in book texts because they are of the same nature as type; halftones are too gray in character. I suppose, then, that you are right that an appropriate type to match up with halftones would need to be lighter in overall color.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lighter perhaps, but so contrasty? It still just doesn't jibe for me with his comment about being drawn to avoid the extremes of thick and thin usually seen in modern style typefaces. In this way, I would think Gill's Joanna is perhaps a better answer to this matter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; K. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't see Electra as all that contrasty. Compared to Joanna sure, but the latter is more of the oldstyle approach to letterpress design. Electra certainly was not a Modern typeface design in the historical sense. There is certainly something else going on there. Moderns also required a fairly smooth paper and there was initially a reaction in opposition to them because of this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe that the contrasts built into Electra serve a technical purpose. If Hrant would put up the 96 point, the Linotype specimen, (hint, hint) along with the similar sized digital, you will seem some interesting characteristics to the original that would more have served the face as a letterpress face. I suspect these were &quot;knowingly&quot; altered by the digital designers.</div>

He has made a study of the ways in which types were adapted to different sizes in different periods and technologies, and has identified ten principles for optimising type for different sizes. He showed me samples of a custom version of Aldus, optimised for 6-12pt. The 6 and 12 point sizes were manually designed, and the intermediate sizes were interpolated. Adobe, of course, tried in some of their Multiple Master fonts to interpolate between a much greater range of sizes (between 6pt and 72pt). I tend to agree with my German colleague that interpolation for optimised sizes only works across a smaller range of sizes.</div>

There were separate drawings made by hand for each character of each size of each design.

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, here's the report I promised. There are still gaps in some of the details, but I think this provides the broad strokes of the provenance of the Linotype outlines.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The primary sources for this research are conversations with Mike Parker and Matthew Carter, augmented by the timeline given on the Linotype Library website. For those who don't know: Mike was Director of Typographic Development at Mergenthaler Linotype Co. (MLCo) from 1959 to 1981. He succeeded Jackson Burke, who in turn succeeded Chauncey H. Griffith. Matthew worked with Mike at Linotype from 1965 until 1981, when they both left to co-found Bitstream (with Cherie Cone and Rob Friedman).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* * * * * <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In 1958, Mergenthaler Linotype Co. introduced the Linofilm phototypesetting system. The original Linotype production drawings were used to convert the designs to film. The Linofilm system, however, was limited to an 18-unit em, so the original drawings had to be adapted to this system. In many cases, this may have been a simple matter of marking new side-bearings on existing drawings, but some faces may have had characters redrawn, as well. Also, new drawings would usually have been made for characters that would benefit from the absence of kerning and duplexing constraints &ndash; characters like the 'f', as well as many italic designs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In a process which is somewhat analogous to the metal process of Drawings -&gt; Brasses -&gt; Punches -&gt; Matrices, the drawings were used as patterns to cut friskets from rubylith; these friskets were photographically reduced to create glass &quot;plaques;&quot; the plaques were assembled into an oversized version of the Linofilm grid; and this array was used to produce the Linofilm film master. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Linofilm optical system was only capable of enlarging to 200%, so three grids were needed to cover the size range: one for 6-12, one for 12-24, and one for 18-36. The master drawings used were usually 8, 12, and 18 point, but there may have been exceptions. Later the V-I-P system was capable of covering a wider range with a single master and the middle, 12-point size became the default master. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s, MLCo began converting the fonts into digital data. The friskets were scanned on a drum scanner and the data was &quot;quantized&quot; on a main-frame and converted into fonts for the Linotron machines. Linotrons set encoded data as vertical stripes, but it is unclear whether this data was initially stored as such or as outlines. The Linotron 202, introduced in 1978, is mentioned as the first model to store the font data as outline vectors. I could not determine what format these vectors were encoded in, but they may very well <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have been Bezier splines. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In 1987, Linotype licensed its typeface library to the fledgling Adobe and the fonts were converted into the now-familiar Type 1 Postscript format. Type 1 was a proprietary format until 1989 or 90, so I would think that Adobe did the conversion themselves, but a recent Linotype catalog indicates that the fonts were digitized by Linotype. (This could, of course, simply refer to the original digitization from the friskets back in the 70s.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* * * * * <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When the American Linotype offices were closed down for good in the late 1980s, Mike Parker managed to save some of the materials from destruction. There was a complete set of Linotype matrices which had been used by the MLCo. in-house typesetting department. He got these donated to RIT. Later these went to the Smithsonian Institute, where they are stored off-site to this day. I don't know what happened to the brasses. The production drawings were initially put into storage and later offered to the Smithsonian. The Smithsonian was reluctant to take them because of concerns about mold contamination. So Parker found a home for these with the Museum of Printing in North Andover, MA. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* * * * * <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matthew said that in the early days of photocomp and offset printing, the results were really terrible. Over time there was some improvement. Although apparently there was some speculation that the font companies went back and added weight to the characters, Matthew said this is baloney. Instead, plate-makers and printers probably just learned how to use the photo output better.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Faced with the daunting task of converting the metal library to photocomp back in the late 50s, the MLCo Drawing and Matrix Manufacturing departments must have felt that it would be impossible to redraw every single character to compensate for the difference in gain &ndash; not and get the Linofilm system to market in a timely fashion. Matthew said, &quot;Having just done that to one family, I cannot see how it could ever have been accomplished at the time for the entire library.&quot; He is referring here to his recent reworking of Linotype Monticello for the Princeton University Press.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also in reference to that project, he told me, &quot;As I discovered with Monticello, the work of improving the photocomp data until it looks reasonable is really daunting. The digital font will never look exactly like the hot-metal face printed by letterpress, but at least it will not be as anaemic as digital data made straight from the hot-metal drawings.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* * * * * <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Respectfully submitted, ;-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; Kent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">One more clue that Larson used formulas: if you look at the alphabet lengths, and their gradual [relative] increase from the 14, you see that the percentages are suspiciously round. If you take the 14 to be 160, you get: 3.54, 7.39, 9.37, 13.75*, 16.25.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yeah, I'd say paper stock has a profound effect on  the look of Electra. At the end of the specimen showing in Big Red are two pages from the Limited Editions Club publication of Ravelais' <em>Garganatua and Pantogruel</em>. In twelve point Electra. Quite nice. Any baseline shifting is not readily noticeable. Includes decorations by Dwiggins. The reproductions are extremely clean and precise, as must be the original, which I doubt was printed on slick stock. Probably a bunch of copies of this available through places like abe.com. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Again though, I'd suggest baseline shifting is common for most of the small text sizes in the faces presented by Linotype. Even Dwiggins' Metro.  I believe this is done on purpose, as an aid to legibility, reversing my earlier judgement that this was a technical problem (?) In many cases, for instance, the lowercase v will drop severely in the 7 point and begin to slowly correct itself as per the point sizes increase. The ce combination and lu combination begin to adjust to each other likewise as the size increases. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, how about scanning up a bunch of those for us, bud.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Letters and Nils Larson<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the monograph I referred to above. It is quite small &ndash; 4.5x7&quot;, 36 pages. Nicely set in 10 pt Monticello. There are seven short tributes from Walter Tracy, R. Ruzicka, P.J. Conkwright, Hermann Zapf, Paul Bennett, Jackson Burke, and James Darley. All, save Burke's, are average about 500 words. There are also five pages listing the typefaces Larson had a hand in. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You won't find any magic formulas. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That &quot;eye is the final arbiter&quot; statement is Griffith's. Tracy was just quoting CHG. This was a common Griffithism.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Larson's first job was as an apprentice in a brass foundry and machine shop in Sweden. He started at Mergenthaler as a clerk in the matrix department. Later he started training in the letter-drawing department. He took night classes in art and architectural design. Larson advanced through the drawing office to eventually become the supervisor. He basically came up under Griffith and would have absorbed a lot of his knowledge from CHG's methods. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Only after the pilot size of a typeface was completed and approved for all technical details of shape and proportion and fitting, then the remaining sizes of the series would be graded for correct optical proportion. From Burke's tribute:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;In order that a type design may pervade a series, optical illusions need to be effected. Six point type looks like its related twelve point only because it is carefully drawn to be different. It is proportionately wider, heavier, squarer and more open. It is Larson's trained eye which establishes how much wider, heavier, squarer and more open. There is no formula which serves to shepherd a design through all these permutations.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There wasn't a formula, but that doesn't mean that everything was done arbitrarily or willy-nilly. I would guess that Larson (and Griff) had some rules of thumb in their heads. Once the grading of the essential dimensions of a design was determined, the figures were recorded on a graph. This became the master blueprint for that particular typeface. But the graph would vary by design. The point is that the graph recorded what the eye determined, not the other way around. That was Griff's stance on fitting as well. &quot;The eye is the final arbiter. . .&quot; I know, it frustrates the hell out of you. (It frustrated Dwiggins somewhat too, as he kept looking for a formula for fitting. I believe Tracy's method may have been based on Dwiggins's search.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One could probably deduce much of those rules of thumb by analyzing different designs in the Linotype line. When I'm able to get over to the Museum of Printing I hope to take a closer look at this matter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Colophon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of yours the new series, Vol I, Number 1, Summer 1935? In a letter from June 20, 1935, Dwig writes, &quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Emblems and Electra<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is going to be pretty swank. It will be interesting to see how the printing trade takes it. My bet is that it will be good merchandising. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Colophon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> use of Electra will be a good christening, I think. The type looks fine in the pages we have got so far.&quot; The two publications were contemporary.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Emblems<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is set in twelve point, the pilot size. Electra was not released yet, but the pilot was completed and the series was being graded. Obviously, the eleven was also done, since <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Colophon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> used it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm at a loss to explain the degree of ragged baseline in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Emblems<!-- raw HTML omitted --> related to the other examples. But in general, the movement of the bottom overshoot on the rounds and pointeds as one traverses the different sizes was very likely another dimension that was graded for optical adjustment by size. Somewhere I recall reading Harry Carter discussing some general figures for overshoot &ndash; maybe in the Fournier; I'll have to try to dig that up some day. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; Kent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">As someone noted, optical sizes really deserve a thread of their own, but briefly:  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe are implementing the &lt;size&gt; feature in all their own families with 'opticals', and are encouraging other foundries to do the same. At the moment, it is a little difficult to add &lt;size&gt; information to a font, as the feature utilises the GPOS table in an unorthodox way (basically, it uses the table to store a string of bits that provide information to an application but do not constitute a normal GPOS lookup). I have not experimented with the Adobe FDK or FontLab in this regard, but since I used VOLT for all my OT development I would probably need to post-process fonts with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TTX<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in order to add &lt;size&gt; information to the GPOS table.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->InDesign currently has an 'Automatically use correct optical size' preference, but this currently only works with MM fonts with an optical axis. My guess is that this function will be extended to the OT &lt;size&gt; feature, but I don't know when.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Or maybe Larson took enough liberties with the original to make it work well at all sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe he did. The evidence is in the specimens. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;They must have trusted him.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe they did. Witness the tributes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;But let me be clear: I'm all for the eye deciding what the numbers are - no doubt about that. And I don't pretend it's worth devising a Magic Formula that accomodates everything (even if that's possible). What I'm saying is that math was -and is- used a lot . . .<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't argue with you there. And I don't think Griffith would either. They clearly used plenty of math. But they didn't have a formula. Just because a certain proportion or interpolation worked in one instance, doesn't mean that it would work in the next instance. Which is why a trained eye is needed to judge the results. Hence Griffith's statement. I think you take read too much into it. &quot;The eye is the final arbiter&quot; doesn't mean you don't measure, multiply, and cogitate. It just means that when all is said and done, you *look* at it and decide. Use the math, but trust your eyes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In that Falcon memo, by the way, the very next sentence following that &quot;arbiter&quot; statement, and which Tracy did not include in his quotation, is &quot;Just how accurate is the eye and whose eye is a safe and acceptable standard, is an open question that can be answered &ndash; by whom?&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Falcon grading is by and large mostly linear, but it is not *strictly* linear. The advance proof (the final proof made of each size of each design, which becomes the official record of the font) lists several key measurements for a given font. Those that bear most on this discussion are the face height (from top of ascenders down to the bottom of descenders), the height of the capital H, and the length of the lowercase alphabet.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've put together a graph of these three features over the range from 6- to 12-point Falcon. In creating my graph, I used a convenient scale for the beginning and end points of the lc alphabet line; then I placed the end points of the other two in the same places and located the in-between points proportionally. So there are three completely different scales. My purpose was to be able to overlay the lines so that we could compare their degrees of linearity. I'm sure someone more mathematically inclined than I will tell us if my method is flawed. The figures are included in my graphic for you to do your own analysis, if you wish.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't have an explanation for the divergences in the upper range. You can see by the number of decimal places they bothered to measure that the processes were geared for precision machining, so I don't think you can explain them away as some sort of manufacturing errors. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Make of this what you will. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;that people I otherwise admire have a coping mechanism preventing candor.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you mean Griffith? I don't think he was trying to hide anything. That &quot;romanticism&quot; about Larson was Burke, remember, not Griffith. I think the thing preventing candor is he's dead &ndash; he can't join the forum and explain it all for you. You're going to have to do some digging for this stuff. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe this will help. In a footnote appended to one of WAD's letters regarding Falcon, Griffith offers this explanation of something Dwiggins makes reference to:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;* By 'graph' is meant a method devised by me for charting and recording the predetermined visual proportions and basic dimensional data in relation to each point size of a series, in this case 6- to 11- point, inclusive, above mentioned, predicated on the norms established for the pilot 12-point size. The proportions of height and width and the thickness of stems and hairlines in each size are thus determined in advance of and as a basis for subsequent development of the indicated point sizes required for the series. Dimensional data on the graph is a recording of the visual conception of relative proportion. Visual conception is given a graphic test by cutting experimental characters of each size. If found correct, the standard list of trial characters, 'E H M O R T W e f h j m n o p' are cut in each size as a further test. After final approval of these, the letter draughtsmen proceed with letter drawings for each of the point sizes in the series. N.B., for perfect visual gradation of sizes, each is drawn separately, and none is cut from the master patterns or drawings of any other in geometrical proportion by the pantograph process.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm still digging.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; Kent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; I've put together a graph of these three features <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wow, nice. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The only problem I see with your method is that you can't appreciate the scale of divergence. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the number of decimal places they bothered to measure <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since the Blue and Red are floating-point, the divergence is unlikely to be an error, I agree. On the other hand, I don't think they had precision down to about 2.5 microns (like in the Red 7) back then. In fact, look how round those numbers are: they're a result of some sort of integer math ratio applied to some [whole] source number. Beyond the mil range there's a uniformity that cannot come from eyeballing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's some thoughts: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The deviation in Black (from the straight line) must be due to rounding to integer. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I could understand the deviation in Blue: you want caps smaller in reading sizes than either in really small sizes or sizes verging on display setting. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I have no ideas about the Red divergence. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; &quot;The proportions of height and width and the thickness of stems and hairlines in each size are thus determined in advance of and as a basis for subsequent development of the indicated point sizes required for the series. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There you go! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Makes total sense. You take a 12 point master (the &quot;intended&quot; design*), generate benchmark characters in the 6 that the eye likes using predetermined <!-- raw HTML omitted -->numbers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (that were arrived at through an iterative process with the eye as &quot;arbiter&quot;), refine the numbers some more (using the eye), then generate everything with those numbers, interpolating all the middle sizes (with tweaks as your graph shows). The only problem is that the eye is not linear&hellip; so I would have actually established an eye-determined interpolation scheme in addition. BTW, I once measured InDesign's optical spacing compensation for different sizes, and found that it was bi-linear**: no change below 4 point, a straight line between 4 and 12, a separate straight line between 12 and 72, and then no change above that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Like I said, this is problematic. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->** It probably wasn't some non-linear formula for performance reasons. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, please let me/us know if you find more good stuff like this! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
