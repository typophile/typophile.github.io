  body: "I tried to find this one out. It's something of a custom job.\r\n\r\n\"Based
    on classical Roman capitals, the lettering was specially drawn so that it is unique
    to Oxford University Press.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oup.com/about/\r\n\r\nSo you won't
    find the exact match, but I don't know which 'classic Roman capitals' they've
    based them on."

  body: "I was going to suggest <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-galliard/\">Galliard</a>
    with some modifications. I know Matthew Carter made the version of Pegasus that
    Oxford uses as a text type for their editions. I can try to show you a sample
    in a few minutes.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Here is my crude attempt to use Galliard Bold to re-create this logo. I'm
    sure someone who knows how to manipulate outline points could make a much better
    reproduction. This is obviously NOT my forte, although I did move some outline
    points around. I used white rectangles to block out some serif parts and the R
    leg top. (My apologies to Matthew Carter)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OxfordSim_3964.gif]"

    body: Thanks a million, Mike...you're probably right, it's probably Carter when
      he wasn't busy with Pegasus. After all, the second line is a heavy font of Galliard.
