    I missing something here? Aachen is only 2 fonts. Pretty pricy for getting Aachen
    medium, considering I have multiple licenses for Aachen Bold, since it was frequently
    given as a bonus with Adobe software back in the day.\r\n"

  body: I knew there was a major reduction in the price of the Dyslexie font, passing
    by their web site some time ago, but this is good news. Unfortunately, it may
    be symptomatic of bad news - while the Dyslexie font was roundly criticized by
    many in this forum, it's still bad news when a tool that could help people with
    a disability is not being used - at least, when something better is not available.

    Myriad, Frutiger...."
