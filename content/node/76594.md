  body: "The Punchcut folks are experimenting with a few tweaks under the hood. Voting
    is one of them -- cf.: Nina's link above. \r\n\r\nThey've also installed an AntiSpam
    module utilizing Akismet. We're going to see how well it works. \r\n\r\nHave to
    say, so far a little underwhelming. There have been more false positives than
    actual spam caught. And I've seen some obvious spam slipping through. \r\n\r\nBut
    the algorithm is supposed to improve with interactive feedback. So, we're going
    to give it a chance. \r\n\r\nBut if a legitimate comment seems to disappear on
    you, bear with us while we sort this out. "

  body: I don't get the "Vote" thing either.  If I want to follow a thread, I will,
    if I don't, I ignore it.  I don't think what interests me personally should have
    any effect on what someone else wants to read and visa versa.

  body: Typophile voting buttons? They were supposed to be Turkish. Some say they
    were German. Nobody believed they were real. Nobody ever saw them or knew anybody
    that ever used them, but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have used the
    buttons. You never knew. That was their power. The greatest trick the Devil ever
    pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. And like that, poof. they're
    gone
