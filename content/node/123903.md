body: "I'm struggling with a typeface choice and weight/size/spacing issue. The logo
  below needs to function across a broad range of uses, from relatively small in a
  web site header all the way up to banner size. I initially used Helvetica Neue condensed
  black for its strength, compactness, and classic qualities, but am having doubts.
  The top line in the image is Helvetica, the bottom line Myriad, which is more \"modern\"
  or lack of a better adjective. However, Myriad is not as compact and I don't want
  to horizontally scale to made it more so.\r\n\r\nMy primary struggle is with the
  treatment for \"ocean race\". It's essentially a modifier and \"Annapolis Bermuda\"
  needs to be dominant, or at worst they need to be equal in prominence. The logo
  needs to be able to stand alone without the date year, and as a result I'm not comfortable
  with aligning \"ocean race\" left or right and reducing the spacing.\r\n\r\nAny
  and all feedback and suggestions on how to treat \"ocean race\" and 2016 are welcome,
  and feel free to suggest alternate faces for the the entire logotype. "

  body: I have seen there you have the same ideas but using different fonts.. Try
    to play with icon take it before the text and making different variations of logos.
    Give some space between the letters of Annapolis  and Bermuda ..

  body: "\"Annapolis Bermuda needs to be dominant\"\r\n\r\nTo me the dominance is:
    1. 2016; 2. Ocean Race; 3. Annapolis Bermuda\r\n\r\nHave you tried putting Annapolis
    and Bermuda on separate lines so you can make them bigger?"

  body: "Thanks James. I have not tried that because I don't want to make the type
    stack taller than it already is, although I will now go back and play with it.
    In addition, there is the potential for a named race sponsor being added, further
    expanding the length of the name to \"<sponsor> Annapolis Bermuda Ocean Race\".\r\n\r\nI'm
    fine with making the year light/thin, and was headed in that direction to make
    it less dominant. I guess what it comes down to is how to treat \"ocean race\"
    so it is of equal or less dominance than Annapolis Bermuda."

    body: "Hi Suijin,\r\n\r\nFrom my opinion, you could make the \"ocean race\" less
      dominant in this logo with make it a bit more smaller and add more letterspace
      in between the characters. I know you already tried to make it smaller, but
      try to make it a bit more smaller (left bottom is a good point to go)\r\n\r\nplay
      with some dots or line to fill some negative space if it's help, try it and
      good luck!"

    can play around with the fonts and symbol:text proportions to see what you like
    but this can solve your dominance problem without increasing the number of lines."
