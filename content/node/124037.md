  bought this image as an EPS file. I don't understand why I can't edit these texts
  as text object in Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw.\r\n\r\nThis entire EPS logo is
  fragmented in very small pieces, for example, the letter \"Y\" is not a single object
  but a lot of pieces of objects, so, I can't make changes on this logo.\r\n\r\nIt
  has no font information."
