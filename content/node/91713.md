  are of stamps on original German WWII clothing - I cannot seem to find the fonts.
  \ They are all from the same company but on different pieces of clothing.  I tried
  to find this font but it made my head so dizzy looking at so many fonts.\r\n\r\nApologies
  for the poor quality but these stamps are difficult to read.  I will include 4 pictures
  since each shows a different part of the letters/#'s clearly.  These 4 stamps read.\r\nRB-Nr.

      quality but in hand they are much easier to see and when compared to the font
      that is exactly it.  \r\nPerfect - much appreciated.\r\n"

    or appliances that stamp a consecutive number on any and all substrate. Check
    out stamps and numerators and you will be enlightened, I think."
