  <BR> <BR>You might have a little beter understanding of the logo and such. <BR>
  <BR>Keep in mind that the colors in the .PDF came out quite washed out &#40;the
  joys of illustrator&#41;, if you reference the PMS, you might get a more accurate
  feel for the colors. <BR> <BR>Suggestions Please!!! <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.'

  body: Kyle - main problem, imho, is the little digital doodads <BR>that you created.
    For lack of a better description, <BR>they are like little digital sperm rising
    up, ready <BR>to overthrow Cobalt Data. <BR> <BR>I think what you have looks better
    standing alone. <BR> <BR>If the client insists on another element... <BR> <BR>You
    might check with a stock-image provider and type <BR>in words such as &#34;database&#34;
    &#34;network&#34;  &#34;digital&#34; etc. <BR>With such a raster element you could
    have a background <BR>that uses a diffusion dither approach with a subtle  <BR>5-
    to 10-percent tint variant. <BR>&#40;bitmap tiffs are color-changeable when placed
    in Illustrator&#41; <BR> <BR>another idea to try is to use those little doodads
    <BR>within the letters of Cobalt Data as digital connectors... <BR>i&#39;m guessing
    it&#39;ll probably be over the top in a comic <BR>book kinda way, but it might
    be worth exploring...if <BR>the client wants to you to go there.  <BR> <BR>bj

  body: '&#62; they are like little digital sperm rising up <BR> <BR>Haha, I never
    saw that. I see how they could be construde as such, especially by one such as
    yourself. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I hate doing this &#34;techy&#34; type design. I&#39;m
    so bad in this arena, the tech thing just does nothing for me. <BR> <BR>hildebrant.'

  body: Looks great to me.  <BR>I agree with bj about that &#34;sperm thing&#34;.  <BR>I
    would take it out completely. Will look cleaner  <BR>and will give more emphasis
    to the logo. <BR>And center the logo optically not mathematically. <BR>&#40;just
    move it up a little&#41; Look like it is falling domn now. <BR>
