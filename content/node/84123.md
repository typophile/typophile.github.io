body: "(newbie question)\r\nWhen searching for free-licensed fonts for a project,
  I've found that a lot of fonts looks pale and thin on screen, unless enlarged to
  a very big size. Others are dark enough, but somewhat blurred. Theirs glyphs don't
  have homogeneous black color with sharp outlines which distinguishes them from the
  background.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile sharp_4723.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt
  the picture above [[http://www.megaupload.com/?d=6W0D0HSM|(at the file I've uploaded
  to this link it is much more obvious to see)]], only line 3 (DejaVu Sans) and 5
  (Arial) are clear and sharp.Lines 1 and 2 are blurred, and line 4 is blurred and
  also not dark enough.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to ask what makes some fonts sharper
  then others, and weather making a font to look sharper on screen involved a lot
  of work.\r\n"

  body: "Yes, it involves a lot of work. \r\n\r\nFor an interesting new take on this,
    check out the RE types from Webtype/Font Bureau. The old \"web safe\" fonts, Arial,
    Verdana, Georgia, Times etc. are optimized for a screen rendering method that
    is rather outdated: snapping to the pixel grid, with or without blur. The RE fonts
    are more future minded. This kind of hinting is certainly less time consuming."

  body: OH dear goodness, what now is RE rendering? I love the way this industry is
    becoming 'future-minded' so quickly, but it's becoming increasingly difficult
    not to be left behind, no? Frode, do you have any links that explain what this
    is/how it works?

    didn't refer to \u2018RE rendering\u2019, but to RE fonts. These are the fonts
    from Font Bureau that they call \u2018Reading Edge\u2019. In simple terms, they
    seek to provide the best screen rendering at text sizes across a range of different
    screen rendering technologies by combining strategies of outline design and hinting."

  body: Few really fully understand. David Berlow is so far beyond in terms of intelligence
    :) It involves a compromise between sub pixel rendering, grayscaling and pixel
    snapping. Stems with equal widths will render consistent when the left side is
    snapped to the pixel grid, but allow for more variation in form than full pixel
    snap because the right edge is "free".
