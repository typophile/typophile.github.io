  birth year or life span of the following type designers for a book I'm finishing
  up. The Typowiki as well as the Linotype Library and other online resources, and
  books have been very helpful on other names. Still, I can't find DOBs for: \r\n\r\nVictor
  Caruso  (ITC Bauhaus w/Benguiat)\r\nJoel Kaden (American Typewriter w/Tony Stan)\r\nNed
  Bunnel (Avant Garde Monospaced)\r\nW.A. Woolley (Braggadocio)\r\n\r\nThank you for
  any help/leads.\r\n"
