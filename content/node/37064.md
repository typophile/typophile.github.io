body: 'I want to format a document such that the top portion of the page contains
  the primary text, the lower portion a "sub" text running in parallel throughout
  (the lower portion to be set in a slightly different but clearly related font).
  Is there a word-processing application that will allow me to work on what are essentially
  two different documents, on one and the same screen/page? Ditto for DTP software:
  is there an easy way to flow two separate text files in parallel across an identical
  page range? '

  body: Any DTP app will be able to do this without problem. Trying to do it in a
    word processor will be agony. [[http://www.scribus.net/|Scribus]] is a free open
    source DTP application that will perform somewhat like QuarkXPress.

  body: I've never had to do a layout like that. Both Quark and InDesign will allow
    it easily enough. I don't think the app I use (InDesign CS) would let me create
    two separate master text frames on the master page, so I'd probably make a master
    text frame for one of the parallel text flows, and flow that one automatically.
    For the other I'd create an ordinary master page text box and flow the text manually.
