  with news, questions, and opinions, it has occasionally been tough for me to keep
  up!\r\n\r\nWhat's your method of choice for perusing the stacks? Do you watch the
  blogs of your favorite 'Philes? Or watch a particular forum? Do you subscribe via
  RSS to a whole bunch of stuff and sift later? Do you ever feel like you've missed
  something, if you don't stay on top of it all?\r\n\r\nTim"
