  been working on a logo design for a small business that I started with back in March
  2006.\r\n\r\nSince June 2007, the business sold and now the new owner is actually
  utilizing me rather than letting me sit around and do paperwork.\r\n\r\nFirst off,
  I am no graphic designer.  I have taken classes but I'm far too hard on my own work
  to ever accept anything I do as good enough.\r\n\r\nWell, except for this one.  I
  actually love this design but I felt that I needed to get more opinions, specifically
  opinions from designers.\r\n\r\nI will not tell you what we do though as I want
  to see what people think about this concept as well as if they can figure out what
  services we provide.\r\n\r\nThanks.  I'll be keeping this page open all day.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2008-01-15-_4319.-Blueprints-Now.gif]"

    logo doesn't need to literally describe the specifics of the business. If it does,
    great, but you don't want to over-detail the logo to do that. A logo really only
    needs to represent you.\r\n\r\nAs such, the current logo seems crowded and busy.
    If I had to guess, you do something with blueprints, but given that blueprints
    are kind of a dying product, I'm not entirely sure. ;0)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yep, Destin is a city in Florida.\r\n\r\nBlueprints of Destin is/was the
    original name.  The owner wants to keep it but the very fact that the word Blueprints
    is used twice hurts it some.  Others feel it is too redundant.\r\n\r\nBlueprints
    are not exactly a dying product.  You'd think that they were because we are in
    the digital age but contractors cannot take large computer screens on the job
    site and they'd prefer to not have to scroll around on a tiny micro computer either
    just to view the job details.\r\n\r\nWhat we do is reprographics, specializing
    in printing architectural blueprints, either through reproduction or first time
    plans.  The lines on the left represent the lines that architects use in their
    drawings.\r\n\r\nThe fonts used was an attempt to go away from our current corporate
    feel.  I wanted to let our clients understand that we love what we do, we do our
    job quickly, and we can help them with their needs as general contractors, sub-contractors,
    owners, and architects.\r\n\r\nOne thing I do not want to do is to flat out tell
    them what we do just by looking at the logo.  I'd like for them to be intrigued
    and to wonder about us.  We already have a large clientel base but for those that
    have never heard of us, then the first time they see that logo, I want it to stand
    out so by chance, one day they decide to have plans designed for their own residence
    or commercial, they will remember the name, Blueprints Now!"

  body: "\"I want it to stand out\"\r\n\r\nWell, I wouldn't used things like the blue
    print lines. These are way overused in the cad/architecture world as it is.\r\n\r\nSo,
    is the company 'Blueprints of Destin' or 'Blueprints Now'?\r\n\r\nI agree, having
    the both is very confusing.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The company has both names.  The new owner wants to phase Blueprints of Destin
    out of the name slowly.  He took over in June of 2007 and the very first store
    opening was called Blueprints of Destin.  Since then it has grown to five stores.
    \ I'm not sure of when the first store opened but the new owner wants to keep
    the tie to our roots (or something like that) for the time being.\r\n\r\nApparently,
    he has decided to stick with my design which can be modified as we move forward.
    \ For now he wants to get business cards made up for the two stores that currently
    need them.\r\n\r\nHe never asked me to design the logo.  I just thrust it upon
    him one day to get his opinion and he loved the idea."

  body: Having 2 names is really confusing. Its hard to get passed it. I understand
    that you want to appear less corporate and more approachable... but the Blueprints
    font looks ghost-like. I would only include the "!" if you use it consistently,
    whenever writing or communicating, BLUEPRINTS NOW!

    \"BLUEPRINTS\" bit will get mushed together (\"mushed\" is an approved design
    word, mind you!)\r\n\r\nOn more personal issues, I'm not too keen on the \"W\"
    having one straight stroke and one curved; also, using blue for blueprints seems
    too obvious (not wrong, just obvious).\r\n\r\nHappy hunting!"

  body: "To tell you the truth, this logo looks like one of those DIY logos, that
    are normally very bad and tell me only one thing: \"We are either short of money
    or tight or ignorant. Or a combination of the above.\"\r\n\r\nYou're doing blueprints,
    yet your logo tells people that your blueprints are inaccurate, your business
    is a mess and it'll be expensive since you're cheap, but we'll have to get blueprints
    somewhere else to get the right ones. So paying twice. And that's what your logo
    tells me.\r\n\r\nI'm being frank on purpose because I don't think this current
    logo has any potential worth pursuing. Try to get new ideas in your head and on
    the paper. Or get a designer to do it for you."
