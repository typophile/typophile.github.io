  caller.\" I have humble idea for a single-purpose Tumblr and I though some folks
  from the community might be amused enough to join me in curating it. The working
  title is, \"Gotham is the New Helvetica,\" but that's a pretty bad title and you
  can do better. The idea is simple:\r\n\r\nIn this post-racial, post-serif Age of
  Obama, I see Hoefler & Frere Jones' Gotham everywhere. Like, <em>every</em>where.
  You do, too. Sometimes the application makes sense, sometimes it doesn't. But the
  point is: \"seriously, that's a lot of Gotham.\"\r\n\r\nThat's all. I enjoy spotting
  it out in the wilds of New York (every ten minutes) and have long wanted to catalog
  my sightings. I thought type nerds might enjoy following along. I need a few keen
  eyes to join me, though, because I'm not very good about keeping blogthings up to
  date, don't feel inspired by a particular Tumblr theme, and am prone to the occasional
  Avenir misidentification. So what do you say? Anyone else want to run this thing
  with me?\r\n\r\n(I hope this is the right place and not a totally annoying/hackneyed
  post! I respect you folks).\r\n\r\npaz,\r\nsteve"
