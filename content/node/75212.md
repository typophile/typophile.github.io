  one myself.\r\n\r\nSaw him wearing it in the Arena special on the making of Exile
  on Main St.\r\n\r\nCan't upload it as it is a bmp, so here's the link.\r\n\r\nhttp://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/.a/6a00df351e888f88340133f45b2944970b-popup\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPaul."

    so not necessarily based on a typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JaggerPalaceLaundry_4332.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's
    the sort of thing that [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Jeff_Levine/|Jeff Levine]]
    might have done something close to."

    linto have some fonts in a similar style:\r\nhttp://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/"

  body: "I can see where the monospace link comes in. Tried it out on lineto. Needs
    to be thicker and the horizontal on the L shorter. Will look for the rounded monospace
    thanks.\r\n\r\nThere's definitely a few in the Jeff Levine link that look close
    too.\r\n\r\nThanks both."
