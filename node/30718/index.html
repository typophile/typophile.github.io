<em>“Does anyone know how to find a good production designer?”</em> and started off with:

<em>“Check this out, I put up a contest, so t speak, on sitepoint.com to find someone to help with banner ad creation for a site that I do some frelance art direction for.

The originator of this thread has removed this information for reasons that will be obvious to anyone who reads the responses. 

<em>My original reply starts below.</em>

If you want great design, hire a great design firm and be willing to pay for great design. Expecting great design from a $300 spec job in the form of an online contest is stupid, cheap, arrogant, and insulting to many professional and student designers.</div>

I know that places like this can give real designers a bad rap.  But I also know that I've had experiences not too dissimilar from this online contest where I contracted a designer with a relatively decent portfolio who banged out some crap work in a fraction of the time required and demanded market rate for 3x as many hours as he put in.

FYI - I'm willing to pay market, but for production design.  I'm not hiring an art director.  The direction of the design has already been set.  Now I'm looking for someone to bang out some banner ads.  Should I pay $60 an hour for that?

Anyway, I can't believe you guys can't relate with this experience.  Perhaps you've never needed to hire a designer to assist you on a project.  But if that's the case, just do me a favor and skip this thread -- go cry to someone else.  I'm looking for someone who has hired production designers and could give me some pointers on where to look, what to expect, and how much to pay.

We don't use 'contests' to hire people. It's absurd.

What did you expect to get when you are asking people to work for free?

"I’m looking for someone who has hired production designers and could give me some pointers on where to look, what to expect, and how much to pay."

Well, DON'T look in online design contest forums.

Options:

 - ask local designers in your area for recommendations
 - get a college intern
 - AIGA

How much should you expect to pay? I dunno. I'd say $50 - $150 but there are so many 'it depends' that it's impossible to say. I would say expect to pay what they are worth.

if i were you i'd use my professional contacts, being an art director and all, or failing that, speak to an agency and get them to shortlist some people who'd done work for similar clients, take a look at their portfolios and pay up front for a batch of work, spend the $300.

that should be obvious. after all, by your own admission, you've failed at least twice to get the results you need for your graphics through this kind of contest. your costs may be zero, but *you* have wasted your time. the designers haven't wasted yours - they're not paid and under no obligation, remember?

you're clearly looking for design rather than just knocking out banner ads: "show one or two screen layouts that present your best vision for our store ... This contest is an excercise in showing us your ability to work with photos, typography, copywriting / marketing."

Although...

"Though I'd like to see a type that's more elegant, less heavy. Check out www.gumps.com" ... "Once again, take a look at www.gumps.com" ... "Try to make it look exactly like www.gumps.com but with my photos." "Again, check out gumps." -- all comments made by you in response to one entry.

I wonder who's the amateur here?

i think you're kidding yourself if you think your motive is to try and help younger designers. your motive seems to be to try and get work done for cheap. if you were really interested in helping younger designers why not contact your alma mater and take on a design student to work for you as a PAID intern. internships are a great way for students to get experience and learn from a "professional".</div>

Unlike you guys, I don't have the luxury of lamenting and pontificating about the drudgery of business and design.  I design and I business... and the business side of me looks for value.

For any of you that haven't ever picked up an economics book, value is at or below the price I'm willing to pay.

In this case, I have not seen value yet.  I'm willing to pay zero.

However, if there was a designer on their that was reasonably competent, I'd pay $300 + whatever terms we would agree as fair for future work.

I'm not saying it isn't appropriate to pay someone up-front.  It certainly is, given the right circumstances.  But get off your high-horses about this contest thing!  If it turned out to produce appropriate design, you yourselves would venture to find resources there.

But the mob is fickle.  I get it.  You would rather take pot-shots here 'cause you're all so much better than me. Haha!  What a joke.


Aluminum:

"How much should you expect to pay? I dunno. I’d say $50 - $150 but there are so many ‘it depends’ that it’s impossible to say. I would say expect to pay what they are worth."

What they are worth to whom?

If the answer is to me.. then I'd be happy to.  But prove that you are worth what you ask.


elliot100:

"you’re clearly looking for design rather than just knocking out banner ads:"

I think you've hit the nail on the head.  Was hoping to find someone that could think on their own, but I guess none of those guys can.

Ricardo Cordoba:

"If you were a work- and money-starved young designer right now, would you enter your own contest?"

Who cares?  I do my thing, they do theirs.  Like I said, no one is holding a gun to their heads.

It's more like a carrot that you're holding in front of their eyes -- there's some steady work in store, if you're the lucky winner of my "contest", in which I get lots of free work sent to me and then choose the one I like best.

If you value your own time, then you'd realize design contests are rather poor value for you. 

"In this case, I have not seen value yet. I’m willing to pay zero."

I'm no economics guru. I'm just a lowly web designer. But I the model is at least partially based on 'give me incentive, I give you product'. 

I've tried to get a couple roofers to redo my roof telling them I'd pay whoever did the best job, but I haven't been able to find anyone to take me up on that yet. ;o)

"If the answer is to me.. then I’d be happy to. But prove that you are worth what you ask."

It's called a portfolio.

You're using an online contest to recruit random folks. You're scraping the bottom by default with the online contests. I can't see how you can get worked up about the (lack of) quality you are finding in this situation.</div>

There is a reason why professional organizations (AIGA, RGD, GDC, etc.) forbid spec work in their codes of ethics, and have stipulations regarding what kind of competitions members are allowed to enter. It's because independent designers are exploited by corporate market forces unless they group together.

In that context, doing the right thing is not high-horse, it's solidarity.

Of course, it's not mandatory for designers to be registered professionals in order to practise, as it is with doctors, lawyers, etc. So "non-ethical" mavericks can benefit financially from the status which those professional organizations bring to the work. On the other hand, they miss out on some of the benefits, such as the respect of their peers.</div>

I can't expect for any of you to give me unbiased advice on this topic.

However, while I can understand that this type of thing is frustrating in that it affects the market perception of designers and your market rate, I have to say that your choice to engage in all the teeth gnashing and name calling (i.e. muzzer) in favor of a calm and simple explanation no doubt adds to the very perception you're all trying so hard to dispel.</div>

Darrel, that is the funniest thing I've read on Typophile in a long time--perhaps because it's true.

Let me suggest an alternative explanation to yours for why the work submitted to sativo's contest was so poor: Perhaps it's because it was all submitted by poor recent d-school grads who pulled something quick out of their *ss on the vanishingly small chance they could get rent money for February from some cheap carrot twirler.</div>

Sativo, you are free to offer $300 for someone to develop a custom portfolio exclusively useful to you. You can even demand that they publicly compete with others, for an open critiquing, regardless of their taste for that. And they they impress with fonts, despite those being a resource you've alloted no budget to. You can even, in this free market, demand revisions over and over. I imagine you can even proclaim finally that none are worthy of the prize, or the alleged future work that goes with it. 

For $0 laid out so far, you can also analyze the color levels, arrangements and typographic choices of your favorite contenders, before assembling them all into your own rip, then deem all of them non-winners and forfeit ever paying anything. Gotta love that supply and demand.

Hey, its a free market. For you it is very free, and it seems you are getting what you pay for. Be grateful. Don't approach a bunch of strangers and expect any sympathy; this isn't about the elitism of designers. It is about the elitism of smug ... clients.You came for sympathy and directions for finding an alternate path to your problem. You received the latter and bemoaned it. 

No, now I remember why I left, it was because people want an image that is distinct and different, but looks <strong>exactly</strong> like <a href="http://www.kohls.com/main/home.jsp">this</a>, <a href="http://www.gumps.com/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.bluefly.com/">this</a>, simultaneously.

		<div class="commentbody">Quote from Jspass: <em><strong>"Even though my professional career has been somewhat brief, I have a strong aversion to these so-called clients…"</strong></em>

Carefully cultivating that aversion will save you a great deal of wasted time and effort. Potential clients who are more trouble than they're worth are often easy to identify if you recognize the symptoms.

As demonstrated by this whole thread, one category to avoid are clients with visions of exactly what they want and who expect it at bargain rates. These clients are usually too heavily invested to relinquish enough control to enable a designer to succeed at any price. They expect designers to climb inside their heads and give birth to their brainchild (which is usually a rehash of something they've seen somewhere else). When the project fails, as it usually does, they will always blame the designer, refuse to pay, and feel perfectly justified in doing so.

These clients are sincere, but usually leave a string of frustrated and unpaid designers in their wake. They often tell stories of the "untalented" and "lazy" designers they've hired in the past. They're usually extremely picky about specific and largely unimportant details. They expect endless revisions with no additional compensation and seem oblivious that they're wasting your time. If you bring up the time factor, they'll go on the offensive and accuse you of wasting <em>their</em> time by not giving them what they wanted in the first place.

What they never admit to are their own shortcomings as clients. They view designers as hired pairs of hands who are mostly just supposed to implement and enhance their pre-existing visions. They hire "production artists," and expect them to flesh out their impractical or unworkable ideas. They never realize that their micromanagement and flawed expectations are usually to blame for their bad luck in working with artists. They rarely even realize that they are micromanagers. 

This, however, makes it easy for you, the designer, to spot them in advance. The warning signs, without exception, are always there and will become obvious during your initial visit if you ask the right questions. When you see the warning signs, it's time to say, "Thanks, but I'm not interested." Leave on good terms, but don't look back. Fooling yourself by thinking that you can work with them will only result in frustration, wasted time and too little compensation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jspass, I agree with everything Thylacine said above. In addition, my experience has been not only "you get what you pay for" but "you VALUE what you pay for" - don't make the mistake of thinking that working for cheap will endear you to your clients. The fact is, people are conditioned to value things partly by the price that is asked.

If you ask too little for your services, unfortunately, some clients will associate your low price with low value - and they won't be as respectful of your time as they would if it were costing them more dearly. Obviously, clients have different budgets and if you're just starting out you'll probably have to be a little cheaper for a while - but don't give it away!

I have never and will never work on spec.</div>

If you have no choice but to work for a client of this kind (say it's been passed onto you by someone else, or you've already committed yourself and noticed the warning signs too late) in my experience the only way of dealing with it is to grit your teeth, forget about it ending up in your portfolio, cancel everything else for a few days, tell them you charge per hour for rush (it will always be) exclusive/on call/evening production work, and double your rate.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You can thank the many who brought in the electronic age and it's side effect of ruining what used to run very smoothly.

In the "olden" days - we had Art Directors who paid their dues to get to the spot they were in. We had Production Directors, who even when they had their job, they continued to be educated in the latest papers, printing presses, inks, etc. We had bullpens, where the young, bright and best from art schools would work together, helping each other with design thoughts. There were many checkpoints along the way. A basic comp, approval, execution. Ah, execution - is what happened to it. These persons working had outside suppliers - folks who very seriously took their careers. Many started as apprentices and worked their way up to journeymen. The artists and production people relied on the professionals.

In fact, the whole industry relied on professionals. Literally hundreds of years of experience (from those who had the experience) went into every design piece.

You, Sativo, are now seeing the new end product. Anyone who has made an investment in a computer can be a designer... Good luck.

AND P.S. Give those folks a reason why you cancelled - select one winner, pay them the $300 PROMISED -- and say the contest is over. You don't have to use their work - but god damn - be a person of your word and fork over the funds and name the winner on your site.

New question - Are you stale? Are you really a designer? You look as if you want new ideas to help you design. I remember your first "contest" select a name for the site - did anyone ever win that one?

Come to think of it - have you ever really helped a young designer? All of this looks like you are more of a user of young designers...</div>

Spot on! I had a client once who couldn't even come up with a name for his business and that was a huge warning flag to me. Quoted triple my fee, that was the end of him.

(oh yeah, Sativo couldn't come up with a name either... funny that)

I also had a client who was on the second redesign (third design in all) of her product packaging. Was she indecisive or did she just have terrible judgment? Hard to know; we parted ways when she couldn't articulate her ideas, just that vague "It's still not there yet" thing. But I got the 1/3 up front.</div>

Designers are taught not to work on spec. They do however, work on reject fees. A price is set for the job - you don't like the work you've hired to do - depending on the arrangement or the year, it's 30% to 40% of that price to pay for the work you've asked for.

1/3 upfront - most likely constitutes that reject fee if they don't use the work you've submitted, and takes them off any further financial responsibility.

And yes, I don't know about you - but when you work with a pain in the butt - a reject fee is as good as KY.</div>

I never heard a peep about the list of names I suggested. Seems to me it must have been a bogus contest. Perhaps Sative should just divvy up the $250 evenly between all who submitted.

BTW, my furnace croaked last night during the coldest day of the year. I am having a contest to see who can come fix it the fastest.  The winner will get my share of Sativo's $250 name contest.  Any takers? Step right up.

Chris, the whole frog thing is out of control. Frog typeface, brilliant. Frog mascot, OK. But the idea of using frogs to blow hot air through your house--just too much :) </div>

Maybe that 'contest' was cancelled too, but the rules stated...

<em>"All submissions must be made prior to Jan 30, 2007!"</em>

...so maybe it's still running.

Come on then everyone, let's all make one last big effort to see if we can come up with that name shall we? You know it's worth it.

I must ask what it is with you and frogs. (I lost my dearest friend two years ago - and art director and avid frog collector...)

Meanwhile, I can sympathize. I'm in the South. My A/C Heating unit died a few nights back. I called my guy - 20 minutes later he was here (and no, he isn't a New Yorker at all), the next day they sent 2 guys over to install a new compressor - and hey, only 1/10 the cost of a new unit... trick is... o/~ you have to have a contract if you want to stay ahead... you can bump, you can.... lol


Meanwhile for the Russian Market name contest how about

I completely agree with Thylacine and inarges.

Reminds me of an advertising copywriter who wanted me to do some work on the cheap, branding his start-up agency, on the grounds that he'd give me lots of work once they got established. The first time we met to discuss some early ideas, he realised he had forgotten to go to the ATM and could I pay for the drinks...

Needless to say I professed to being too busy to continue the relationship.</div>

Now this sounds like a true typographer who got stuck on a VGC Typositor machine - and couldn't figure out which was the concave lens to put on the darn machine!!! LOL

I knew many fine typographers who developed that same allergy...
Some even went beyond and became allergic to the convex lenses too!</div>

Seriously, perhaps I came across a teensy bit self-righteous. I have to apologize. I do understand needing entertainment for the kids on long road trips. If you or yours chooses the DVD method I can't hate on that. I might do the same. (Although in a handheld device not an in-built screen. I can't afford to pimp my ride.) 

But, BUT, that said, I think there are many others way to entertain and I'm thankful for all the reading I did on long trips to Vegas to visit my grandparents. (Although I'm sure my parents aren't so pleased that I was reading Anne Rice and Stephen King.)</div>

We went on long car trips when I was a kid: there's nothing wrong with playing good games like "spot the licence plate" or "count the number of deer/moose/elk on the mountain roads" or that old fave "I spy...."  

Heck, back in the dark ages, we didn't even have music driving through the mountains because there was no radio reception.  Kids these days....  ;-)</div>

When I was a child in the UK ('50s and '60s) we used to play "legs", which involved spotting pub signs and scoring depending on how many legs were in the name. (Bricklayers Arms = 0, Hare & Hounds = 24 [max]). But now with all the motorways and bypasses, it doesn't work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Heh. That was my first guess, but the 24 threw me off there. In the back of the ol' LTD, things would have degraded quickly into a debate if my big sister had tried to claim any more than 12 total for that. In the end, it would be all settled by stealthy shin kicks. Except that Nick is right, at least in America, most driving is quite dull thanks to the interstates. Might try that game out sometime, here in town.

The games I remember most were 'Beaver' where you yelled out if you were the first to spot an agreed target (RVs, owls, etc.) for points. I remember my parents would sometimes join in with an 'outside the box' entry. They would spot things like a "Beaver Brand" RV, or a billboard of an owl, with an owl on it. The ocaisonal game of Alphabet evolved to allow the use of natural features, if they were indisputable (like  the 'W' in Mad Mad.. World).</div>

That is the same as Tickle Buggy Ragtop. In our version, the first one to spot a VW beetle got to tickle the others.  If you spotted a convertable VW it was worth 10 tickles and icecream.

I also remember the 7 PA Turnpike tunnels. My favorite was the Tuskarora.

		<div class="commentbody">In 1956, which was, um, a little while ago, my parents packed us four kids in the station wagon and drove all the way from Illinois out to LA, via the southern route, and back along the northern route. And yes, children, that was before the Interstate system. We saw relatives in LA, a lot of national parks, and a bunch of very weird exhibits in gas stations out West: cages full of mountain lions, huge paper mache cowboys, etc. etc. 

That summer the big hit for a few weeks was 'Tranfusion', a song which I have NEVER heard repeated since. Here is a bit of its lyrics, thanks to the internet:

"Toolin' down the highway doin' 79
I'm a twin-pipe papa and I'm feelin' fine
Hey man, dig that -- was that a red stop sign?

"[squeeeeeeeal ... kee-RASH!]

"Transfusion, transfusion
I'm just a solid mess of contusions
Never never never gonna speed again.
Slip the blood to me, Bud."  

It went on like this with verses about "passing the truck on the hill ahead" "out-a my way I don't drive with my horn", each ending with a screech of tires and a loud crash, and another 'transfusion': "slip the juice to me Bruce." 

In my 12 year old mind, this was quite wonderful, and it inspired me to sing a bit and imitate the screeching and crashing sound every time we crossed a railroad tracks. And since this was pre-interstate, there were a LOT of railroad tracks crossing the roads, and we did travel probably 5,000 miles. 

So there is Billy with his crashing sounds and my brothers equally rambunctious, and our little sister being sweet and agreeable. My parents for some reason did not strangle me for this incredibly annoying behavior. Here it is fifty years later, and I remember that trip with love and gratitude. </div>

After extending your ,ahem, "banner ad" contest, you canceled with no notice, despite dozens and dozens of man hours spent. No explanation, no apology. And then you secretly canceled your naming contest (on several sites) in a fit of semi-intelligence.

It's not a contest if no one wins. It is sleazy, a scam, sad exploitation, and there are even laws against it. Your behavior, true to form, is why people here advised you not doing it, and others not falling for your manipulations. Go have fun raping the efforts of free-lance.ru's members.

Some of us have worked very hard in the graphic arts business - we've watched the entire industry change. But somethings never change, and many of us have "been around the block."

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not opposed to getting paid for work produced -- especially if it's market quality.

And you're right, I have been part of this community for a while.  I myself have also been a designer for a while.  But there's three things going on here:

1. An argument being made against "spec" work.
2. A bunch of red-herrings to throw any reasonable discussion off track.
3. Abusive, teen-age b.s.

As for #3, I admit, I let mysself get suckered into it.  It's a little hard not to when after posting a questions to a community one has belonged to for so long, the first thing I get as a response is a deluge of insults and attitude.

As for #2, too many issues to cover.  But on the point of contests:

The naming contest was perhaps a misnomer.  I should have just said, "hey, I'll give x dollars to someone who can come up with a name for us -- any takers?"  While there were some names that I found interesting (those I commented on), in the end, none of the suggested names were selected.  Otherwise, as I spelled out in the "rules" so to speak, I would have registered the name -- which was one sure fire way the contestant would have claim toward the winnings.

As for the sitepoint contest, I didn't develop the market.  Sitepoint has a section on their forums that bring willing participants together.  I gave it a try because, despite what many of you seem to think, not all clients have the luxury of deep wallets and therefore are looking to find more affordable solutions.  I took a shot and it didn't work out.

Now, there is a side note to this:  I've also hired designers in the conventional way and paid market value in the past.  But I too, as a client have been burned.  So just as this original post conjured up memories of when you guys were burned from "bad" clients experiences, my experience with sitepoint conjured memories of when I was burned by bad designers -- people who embellish their portfolios claiming their involvement was greater than it was, etc.

I kind of meshed all of those experiences together and made my post thinking others would relate -- turns out no one here does -- fine.

And now, on to #1:

You all may have strong opinions on spec work, and it's certainly your right to, but who are you to try to force the hand of others?  It's okay to share your opinions, but c'mon!  The vile and attitude shown here was nothing less of mob-mentality.

Look, despite what you think, there is an alternative argument to spec work.

Spec work is good for the market.  It allows low budget companies to engage in giving the design community a chance where they may otherwise not have.  If it turns out to be a good experience for them, great, everyone is happy.  If not, both parties learned a valuable lesson.

Also, spec work should be a personal decision.  Feel free to share your experiences, but uniting against spec work?  It's a price floor -- which is BAD for economies.  Anytime you organize and try to artificially influence the market, it results in less demand.

Additionally, good designers don't need to do spec work.  If you're all as good as you think, why worry?  It's young and poorly skilled designers who engage in spec work -- and arguably to their benefit as it helps give them practice and hopefully they improve their skills.

As for 3rd world designers -- that's a market too and it's fair game.  As a country we're outsourcing more and more... and it's not a bad thing!  Specialization and trade are good things for the economy (look into it).  And FYI - their currency is a ratio of ours.  So just because I pay less using the US dollar, doesn't mean the value in terms of spending power to them is any less (i.e. the sweatshop argument is not valid).

There are other points... but I'll stop here and leave with one final thought:

Many of you guys who are up-in-arms over this issue might stand to think about why you're so upset?  It seems more that you're responding with a knee jerk reaction to past experiences where you've had bad clients.  But think about it... those were good experiences since you learned a thing or two -- so maybe it's time to let it go?!  But more importantly, it takes two to tango.  Bad clients often means bad client management skills.

Sativo, that's one hell of a convenient turnaround in opinion. Is that why you felt relieved of the common courtesy of posting a notice here to let us know the contest was cancelled early and that no one won?

So, tell us, what is the new company's name?

I dunno about that. Designers, myself included, seem to have a strong affection for toys by the looks of any cubicle dwelling designer's decorating with figurines, metal robots, trading cards and the like. Nothing wrong with that, being creative means having a playful mind, right?

And we're definitely snobs. Design snobs. We kind of have to be given the massive amounts of crappy design in the world. ;o)

Just as Sativo is a scam artist snob. I'm sure he and his buddies visit scamartist.com web forums and laugh at the random honest person who pops in now and again as well.</div>

The phrase 'market quality' doesn't mean anything. If you go to the fish market you're gonna get fish.

-

sativo: <em>"Check this out, I put up a contest, so t speak, on sitepoint.com to find someone to help with banner ad creation for a site that I do some frelance art direction for.

sativo: <em>"You guys crack me up! You’re so sad in your little microcosmic design culture. Hope you find that cure for cancer sometime soon! Haha!"</em>

Those 2 posts gave me a brilliant idea...

Why not place a 'Cure Cancer Contest' on a medical research forum offering a big cash prize for the winner, of say, only half the full commercial value of a cancer cure?

I bet that would be the incentive the top research labs need for them to do their best work.</div>

Fair enough. But then why come and complaing about it?

It seems as if you learned from your own experience that 'design contests' are a really bad deal for both parties.

You simply can not find good designers via that particular method.

"Spec work is good for the market."

Look at the architecture industry. It's full of spec work and if you look at salaries and the like, it certainly hasn't helped that industry.

"Also, spec work should be a personal decision. Feel free to share your experiences, but uniting against spec work? It’s a price floor — which is BAD for economies."

I think most industry professional organizations agreeing not to work for free isn't quite the same as price fixing.

"Many of you guys who are up-in-arms over this issue might stand to think about why you’re so upset?"

People aren't as upset with the concept of spec work as they were with your trolling comments. ;o)</div>

Imagine if one of these fine professional designers went to a group of YOUR peers and asked how to get as much money for very little design effort.

		<div class="commentbody">"People aren’t as upset with the concept of spec work as they were with your trolling comments."

I disagree.  I think my comments fueled the flames, for which I took partial responsibility.  But the main emphasis from the community has really been an aversion to spec work and those who seek it.

Also, if you're going to be honest with yourself, take a look at how people have expressed themselves.  People have responded to my post with extreme rudeness!  And yet somehow, despite all the moral condemnation, none of you seem to notice. 

--

"I think most industry professional organizations agreeing not to work for free isn’t quite the same as price fixing."

What do you think Unions do?

--

"Look at the architecture industry. It’s full of spec work and if you look at salaries and the like, it certainly hasn’t helped that industry."

Most service industries, outside of professional industries (law, medicine, etc), work on spec to some extent.  For good or for bad, that's how the market is.

In the software industry for example, there's a lot of up-front selling and idea sharing.  Often times account managers and sales folks invest a lot of time, energy, and money to win a client.

As a designer, I'm sure you also provide presentations, meet with prospective clients, write proposals, etc.  It's a lot of work... and you all do it voluntarily with no guarantee of being payed.

As for the contests, much of the up-front sales work that designers generally have to do is avoided.  It doesn't take much effort to post a forum message saying "I'm in!"

There's a reasonable comparison to be made between the time and energy investment in up-front sales and the time and energy investment in participating in a contest.

But let's be honest here... the real issue is not contests.  The real issue is being tricked into working for nothing and having your ideas stolen.  That's what I think of when I hear "spec work."  Clearly there's nothing right about that.

But that's not what I did.  I engaged in a contest.  And I would have gladly paid the winning contestant if there was one.  But they all produced shoddy work that I couldn't use -- so I didn't declare a winner.  That's how contests work.

So keep things in perspective before you run for your pitchforks and torches.  Contests are different from the spec work described above for the following reasons:

1. Designers understand coming in that it is a contest, which gives them a greater than zero chance of losing.  Those that enter contests are prepared to take that risk.  In my case, there was no misrepresentation about what the risks vs. rewards of the contest were.

2. By entering contests, designers do not have to engage in any up-front sales activities.  The only effort and time they invest is in the work they submit.

3. As for my case, my intentions were sincere -- despite what some of the rabble-raisers on this forum would have one believe.   My goal was to find a qualified designer.  If I did, that designer would have won the contest plus moving forward I would worked with him/her on a hourly or time and materials basis.

"You care about exploiting them for your own profit. You don’t give a damn if they can’t pay the rent."

You're right.  Their rent is not my problem.  My profit is.

But that doesn't mean I took advantage of anyone.  Again, I didn't lure anyone in under false pretenses.  Everyone knew the rules going in.


"In theory there’s nothing wrong with looking for spec work, but why would you come to a forum of professionals and ask how to get unprofessional help on the cheap?"

I actually covered this already.  I came here because I have been a member of this community for a while now... and there are many opinions on this forum that I respect (some I don't).  I was sure someone has been in a similar situation to mine and could offer a constructive suggestion.  I was wrong on both counts.</div>

Everyone, everyone, I am having a contest!! $500 to the person who can guess the number I am thinking of. This contest is of an indefinite time, and subject to my admitting you guessed the number I am thinking of. Should anything change, prize is forfeit, and I will not explain. The check is in the mail, scout's honor.

Unfortunately, these "spec" "contest" scams really bum me out. I'd love to run a legit contest to promote the snark, but the reputation that con-artists have made in that field ruin things for the rest of us. Perhaps I need to charter a Snark Foundation first, and put the prize budget in escrow.

Did you ever notice that pop singers stopped singing about American cars around 1970, which they did a lot before that. I think Janis Joplin's 'Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz" was the turning point. American cars just lost their 'coolness'. </div>

It seems he was giving us a bit of a shot with a snide remark about AIGA and their well known anti-specwork stand.  It also removes evidence of his contest incase anyone might want to think about legal action. This eternal farse would be a fun Judge Judy episode though :-)

		<div class="commentbody">I may not like sativo's ethics, opinions or manners, but changing this thread's original title and removing his opening post is just taking the piss and shows a complete lack of respect for everyone here.

I've just noticed he has also emptied all his entries on his <strong><em><a href="http://typophile.com/node/29587" target="_blank">"Help us pick a new company name!"</a></strong></em> thread, except for one.

I quoted sativo's very first paragraph from his original post of this thread in one of my earlier posts...

<strong><em>"Check this out, I put up a contest, so t speak, on sitepoint.com to find someone to help with banner ad creation for a site that I do some frelance art direction for. Desipite the fairly detailed instructions and feedback that I leave for them, not one comes up with anything that resembles professional work."</strong></em>

...and I think this thread's original title was something like...

<strong><em>"Does anyone know how to find a good production designer?"</strong></em>

Maybe jpad could edit his first post (as he was the first to respond) and put sativo's original title and first paragraph above his own entry.

So, clearly, they're right when they say Denial is not just a river in Egypt. (groan)

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm...I received an (unsolicited) email today and I was wondering if you guys could tell me what are your thoughts. Is this considered spec work? I don't want to accuse anyone but all the symptoms are there. Here it goes:

http://www.pedroguitton.com/celebraty_logos/

In the email, Mr Guitton invites designers (well, anyone really) to submit a logo dedicated to the celAbrity (whatever that means) of your choice. He makes clear that it's for HIS book so we presume that HE'll make money out of it, right? Then again he says the book will be SOLD in 50 countries. He also says it's in occasion of the celebration of 15 years of Editora Index Book. (so what?) And he says you can join for free!!! What a deal, you don't even have to pay to send work!!

Now, like the good Typophiler I am (you guys are a terrible company I tell ya) I started to smell something. I checked the link and immediately the typos (in English AND Portuguese) made me slightly sick.The deadline date seems to be wrong since I received the email today...When I had a look at the submitted work (I mean Bruce Lee, Bill Gates and Co.) then I felt REALLY sick. 

I looked and looked and looked but found no sign of financial compensation for the work submitted. Not even a hint so again I presume the designer will submit work for the "glory". It doesn't even say the designer will be credited. 

Now you look at his site and he seems to be kosher, I mean he's a designer, teaches etc. respectable credencials I guess. But is that right? Am I reading too much into it? I am ready to apologise if it turns out I have no reasons to be suspicious, I am not trying to start a crusade or something but it doesn't feel right. That's all I am saying. What do you guys reckon? Is the disease spreading? Cheers.

		<div class="commentbody">Lore, I think that you should trust your misgivings on this one... While I don't think that technically this would qualify as spec work, the project does indeed sound very sketchy.

Mr. Guitton posted a <a href="http://typophile.com/node/6741" target="_blank">similar request</a> on this forum in 2004... Interesting, no? Kinda makes you want to avoid the whole thing.

On the other hand, the book he was collecting logos for back then, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logos-North-America-Pedro-Guitton/dp/8496309142/sr=1-1/qid=1169952330/ref=sr_1_1/104-9672182-5386346?ie=UTF8&s=books" target="_blank">Logos: From North to South America</a>, was actually published. I recently saw it at one of the big chain stores... I wish I could say I liked what I saw. The cover certainly looked promising. But I didn't see any evidence of careful editing, translation, or proofreading, I'm sorry to say. Would you want to be in a book like that, even if you did get proper credit?

Lastly, I don't know too much about his publisher, <a href="http://www.indexbook.com/" target="_blank">Index Books</a>, except that they have offices in Barcelona. I've seen some of their other books, too... Like <a href="http://www.indexbook.com/libro.php?359" target="_blank">this one</a>, which seems like fun. Maybe they could do one on graphic design scam e-mails, too.  ;-D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, the world is really small. Amazing. I had no idea he had been here before, I should have checked. Thanks for confirming my theories in this thread and in the other one.
Yeah, no. I really dislike the whole thing. All aspects of it, the lack of care, the way the thing is presented, the idea itself. I also noticed he really insists on the "for free" story in the other thread like we should be grateful is not charging us to be in his book or something. Cool, thanks. The whole spec work issue and the sativo saga opened my eyes a lot. Here in Brazil, this kind of practice is so common that you don't even notice anymore, you end up thinking everything is normal.

Hell no. I wouldn't even know which celebrety or celebarty or celebraty to pick. The idea!</div>

Of course, last time I ran a contest (to name my blog) I ended up giving out three prizes instead of the one I'd advertised, because I decided I wanted to use multiple entries in different ways. But I guess that's where our attitudes differ.

Okay, it's pretty obvious the main players here are people who participated in my naming contest.  The contest officially has not ended yet, FYI... so that's why there were no announcements.

However, I made it clear that if no names are registered, then that means that no names have been selected.  To-date, no names have been selected.  I'm sorry that hurts your feelings, but them were the rules.

As for your point Thomas.. I appreciate your good intentions, but as it turns out, the people on this forum (at least most of those involved in this thread) have proven that they are unreasonable.  They aren't willing to hold a rational discussion but are really just looking to bash me.  For that reason, I won't be commenting here any further after this post.

But I did want to point out to you that your argument is a bit of a non sequitur.  If you're going to make a claim that your better than me from an ethical perspective (and I believe that was one of the intentions of your argument) then it would be helpful to form a valid argument.

To paraphrase your argument, you claim the responsible thing to do in a contest is to select a winner and pay him/her even if what he/she submitted was not worthy of ever being used by the contest holder.

And to support your conclusion, you used the example that you yoursef have paid contestants (even multiple contestants) in a contest that you held.  But then you go on to say thay you actually used their work?

So how does this support your argument?  Do you have an example of holding a contest that you paid a winner even if in your mind there was no winner (or a submission you will ever use)?

And if if you do have such an example, can you explain the rationale behind why a conestant should win when they don't deserve to?</div>

This isn't obvious? You need to give out the prize because you said you would. You should keep your word.

In my case, I'm not at all sure I was ethically obligated to give out three prizes instead of one, but I thought it was the fair thing to do.

Added later: I guess one point is that when your ethical obligation is unclear, if faced with a decision as to whether to err on the side of generosity or stinginess in fulfilling that obligation, it's probably a good idea to err on the side of generosity. Especially if the situation is a public one!

I never said I'd pay if there wasn't a winner -- on here or sitepoint.  In fact, sitepoint was designed to allows contest holders to cancel a contest if there are no winners.

Perhaps we should define we mean by contest.  You're thinking of a pagant.  Where people enter and the best one of the group is guaranteed to win.

When I offered a contest to name our company, the terms were that the winning name will be declared if it is registered.  I don't need names that I'm not going to use.  I'm not holding the contest for sport or some unlrelated promotion.  My goal was to find a name for my company.  That didn't happen so there were no winners.

Same with this the sitepoint contest.  It wasn't a promotional event.  I had a very specific need.. which wasn't met.

Maybe the term contest just isn't the right thing to call these things.  On the one hand, I suppose it is a competition.. but on the other hand, I'm not going to hand out "prize" money if I didn't feel anyone won.

In both cases, I received a bunch of submissions that jsut were not what I needed.  Sorry guys, but you just didn't nail it.  I'm not going to be forced to pick one anyway.  That would be silly.

It appears you are only now choosing to selectively address a side issue because you think that by deliberately missunderstanding Thom's post you can finally achieve some kind of moral or intellectual high ground.

After deleting posts, renaming threads and ignoring simple questions, do you not realise how stupid, arrogant and petty that is?

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">So, I've urged you to go elsewhere, but you are still lurking. And changing your story. I'm going to explain this, because not everyone has the same degree of understanding of why there is a problem. I'll try to use examples a lot.

<em>Analogy time: I am holding a race, for a prize of a $5000. The person who gets the farthest wins, assuming I approve of the method of travel. It's my contest and my prize, so it is fair I'll judge, right?</em>

Can everyone see how this is fundamentally broken? If it isn't immediately apparent, think about what is missing above.

The source of the problem here:

<em>"If the contest info suggested that there wouldn’t necessarily be a winner, there’d be no reason for sativo to award a prize."</em>

Thomas is a nicer person than I. But, no. A suggestion is not a way to codify a contest. One shouldn't suggest that they entrants be adults, for example, instead you pick a minimum age. Likewise, the methodology of determining forfeit is not something to be vaguely hinted at. If I suggest that those under 16 <em>might</em> not win, that doesn't mean they don't. I need to say thusly beforehand, or they can."

<em>"Maybe the term contest just isn’t the right thing to call these things."</em>

Damn right it is not. A contest has a win-condition. The "contests" for lack of an accurate polite term, on sitepoint, in other spec work, etc. do not have that. More precisely, they have a win-condition that is unknown, even to the contest implementor. In design cases, were it known, the implementor would probably create the product themselves. That is the first thing that makes this not a contest.

That someone suggested something inherently fallacious probably irked some of the readers here.

Since the win-condition does not exist, it cannot be announced or documented beforehand. First problem here: even were someone to succeed, there is no way for anyone to know, except for the contest implementor. Second problem: people lie, plain and simple. If you prefer a kinder, more complicated explanation, they change their minds, raise the win-condition expectations with their mood, lose/spend the money elsewhere, etc. It happens, even to the most well intending folks. This is why the teacher counts the # of jelly beans in the jar before-hand, writes it down, and tells another about the envelope.

This second part probably upset even more readers. And anyone left was probably furious by these last aspects.

A contest implementor can write a lot of fine print to cover their ass, or hire a lawyer. But it can also be simpler than that. In the unclear moments, society relies on an appearance of good faith to help keep things working. This is outside of law, or below it, really.

When you have a "contest" you have to have a REALLY GOOD reason to not follow through on your end of a bargain. Undefined aesthetic merit is not usually considered such, even in design contest. If you don't have one, you are being malicious and disrespectful to all others involved. Were all the entrants willfully craptastic in their submissions, or absolutely contrary to the stated rules? Would several normal people find this obvious, if they paid close attention? Since the contest announcement, did you learn you have a terminal disease? Was there a fire in your home that destroyed the cash alloted to the purse, or drastic act of misfortune? Then the winner deserves a prize. Period. Or, perhaps every contestant deserves an apology, and a share of the purse.

One "contest" has been extended, canceled, then allegedly resumed,  and the other secretly canceled, resumed and then partially canceled based on who the entrants were. You have half-heartedly removed your own words regarding this. I find good faith lacking all around. You missed the irony of performing all the worst habits I prescribed beforehand, and even appear proud of your actions. This makes me fear that even this post is for naught, but I hope you are beginning to see the problem is not those who condemned you, but a plain ol' bad idea.

By the way, all this behavior is also know to be a common precursor to creative theft, in similar past events. This is a well-known issue to many experienced designers, and a fear of many novices, though it is easily avoided. It is avoided, naturally, buy avoiding those who behave as you have, regardless of whatever your actual intentions were. So what could one expect where there is a high level of proffessional communication in a diverse group of designers? You might consider what you have learned as a designer yourself from these people, down to in this very thread.

If the purpose of the "contests" weren't promotional, then cough up the dough, learn your lesson, and don't do any more. Or, make a start at being "not evil" by apologizing for wasting everyone's time, maybe. We all make mistakes, but how we handle them makes a difference.

If you are begining to understand any of this, it might benefit you to drop the sarcastic, disrespectful comments. It sure won't hurt, except for in your pride, and that will certainly heal fast. I don't imagine that you are uncannily proper in this situation, and that past commenters somehow didn't notice, but will learn from your jabs. Likewise, the idea of an elitist conspiracy seem far-fetched, to understate things. There are too many non-collegiates and seasoned tradesmen mixed with academians here for that to hold water.

Ever notice Hollywood gives out roles as extras in movies, not leads? Not an accident. Real contests work well for promotion, and even sometimes for creating creative product, when run with consistency, integrity and good will. There is a reason why not a single person here, despite WIDELY varied backgrounds (you <em>know</em> they constantly disagree with each other), suggested running another one. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the AIGA. I have made my opinion clear, yet have never been a member, nor had I heard of No-Spec before this thread, but still knew that things just plain don't work like you desire.

I know you are still reading this, and I hope that it provokes some serious thought. If you like, come pick it apart, as that means that you digested it. It's 4am, I'll assume I've made some mistakes.

Or... maybe [[The Silence Brigade]] will come back?</div>

In the United States there are some very definite Federal Laws about holding contests.

I can remember Scholastic Books figuring out a new contest -- it was coming out of their promotion department -- and following to the T, the government's regulations on them.

I don't hold contests, so I've never been bothered to see where in our government it is listed, but I do know they exist -- and are there. Scholastic also let me know that our government does monitor for phoney contests. 

If a private party had a legitimate contest - you can bet that some accounting office somewhere would be holding the prize money...</div>
