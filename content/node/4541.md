  <BR> <BR>Anyone have any idea what this might be based on? I&#39;d guess that it&#39;s
  custom, but if you know of something close I&#39;d love to hear it. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: Chris, These sports logo questions come up a lot. We have talked about having
    an FAQ about them, I think, because these are almost always custom designs. Especially
    your major professional franchises. The logos are usually designed by the firms
    hired by the Leagues or the teams, unless they are based on historical team insignias
    &#40;which were never fonts in the first place&#41;. The teams own the rights
    to these emblems, so duplicating them is almost the riskiest thing to do -- the
    higher profile your project has, the more likely you will get &#39;fanmail&#39;
    from their lawyers. You didn&#39;t say why you wanted to know if there was a font
    like this, but if you love the teams, buy their gear. Play it safe, is my advice.

  body: 'Mike,  <BR> <BR>No worries on copyright infringement, I run a design firm
    and I get it. I&#39;m not looking to create a do-it-yourself Giants jersey. I&#39;m
    just looking for a jumping off point for a client who likes the look but can&#39;t
    afford to have us hand letter their charity event logotype.  <BR> <BR>To better
    phrase the question, I&#39;m looking for a decent script face that recalls some
    of the idiosyncracies of sports/baseball lettering. I&#39;ve seen the stuff at
    Veer and Letterhead Fonts, but they just don&#39;t have the quality I&#39;m looking
    for. <BR> <BR>Anyway, thanks for your post. '

  body: Chris, have you looked at some of the other Sign font sites like <a href="http://artandsignstudio.com/fonts.html"
    target="_blank">SignFonts</a> and <a href="http://www.signdna.com/v2/index.php"
    target="_blank">Sign DNA</a>.  My impression is that these are less well-known,
    but might have some qualities you are after.
