body: "When I was in design school our professors had us design booklets that walk
  through complex/multi-part projects. The idea was that we could take them to job
  interviews to show that we can handle the design and application of brands to a
  variety of materials. I\u2019ve been taking them to interviews, and while they\u2019re
  always well-received, I think they might be hurting me because people want to grab
  them, flip through them, pass them around, comment on the design of the booklet,
  and then compare my work to other interviewees who don\u2019t have the cute little
  books. This ends up taking up a ton of time and distracts from the work I\u2019m
  trying to show. \r\n\r\nAt this point I want to just move the strongest items from
  these little books into my  portfolio. Does that seem like a good way to go? Or
  do people really just dig those cool little books?"

    in a way that sets you apart from other people (and it's not even work you're
    trying to show?) and there's a problem?\r\n\r\nIt's not April yet, is it?\r\n"

    of time to work with. But sometimes I feel like people get wrapped up in these
    things, time runs out, and not having seen other stuff, they\u2019re seeing me
    as a one-trick pony."

    college 101 days was: never pass out handouts until you are done with the presentation.
    You will inevitably deliver your address to the top of peoples heads. I think
    it best if you start calling these little gems 'leave behinds'. \r\n\r\nJac\r\n<em>\"pronounced
