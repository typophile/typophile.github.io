body: A couple of years ago I posted samples of a elegant serif font. Nobody identified
  it, and in the mean time the old posts dissapeared. Here are the samples again ...

    The samples there are double size. People then proposed Meidoorn or other font
    of Sjoerd Henrik de Roos.\r\n\r\nPublication details: all are Romanian books.
    For the three samples here, respectively:\r\n\r\n1. Vladimir Lvov - Viata lui
    Albert Einstein (eng. Life of Albert Einstein), Bucharest, 1960.\r\n2. John Braine
    - Viata in inalta societate (eng. Life at the top), Bucharest, 1965.\r\n3. A.
    K. Vlasov - Curs de matematica superioara (eng. High Mathematics course), Bucharest,
    1950\r\n"

  body: "The design looks like been made between 1910 - 1925. Since the body text
    is the same design, it could be available on a type setting machine. The bold
    seems to have the same wide like the roman, so my guess, its a linotype matrice.
    In this time range, the First Hungarian Type Foundry has produced lots of typefaces
    and matices for this region. Berthold AG, [[D. Stempel AG]]and Bauersche owned
    this foundry. Hope this helps.\r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\" target=\"_blank\">astype.de</a>--"

    period ... it's a starting point."

    Erbar</a> there is this wonderful font named <strong>Erbar Mediaeval</strong>.\r\n\r\nBelow
    is a sample from the document :\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pdf-sample.jpg]\r\nRegarding
    the A: I see Erbar made alternates for various leters, but in this sample the
    regular weight A is the same with the alternate. I think the A from my samples
    is the main version."

    I was lucky to have this idea, to look in all pdfs from http://www.klingspor-museum.de/Kuenstler.html,
    because a de Roos related document was there. Now I'm looking for other samples
    on the Net ..."

  body: Nope. I leave that to more experienced people. But I think that will not happen
    soon, if ever. I cannot find other references of Erbar Mediaeval on the net, leaving
    aside the samples. Somehow this font get lost in transition ... I found out that
    Ludwig & Mayer was sold to Neufville. I wonder if the matrixes still exist ...

  body: "The matrices almost certainly do not exist. I've been told that L&M matrices
    could theoretically still be stored as reference at Neufville in Barcelona, but
    if they don't have any, you are sadly out of luck :(\r\n\r\nFrankfurt and its
    greater area (including Offenbach) were a hot-bed of typefounding before the second
    World War. This was an industrial area, and was virtually destroyed during the
    war. There is very little in terms of remaining materials, sadly.\r\n\r\nVarious
    museums or collectors would have printed samples of L&M faces. I think that these
    serve as better models for digitizing anyway. Matrices are a little thin, because
    they took into account that ink would spread on paper, creating the final letter
    image."

    body: Good point Dan. Maybe I should open a separate thread about Erbar Mediaeval
      to see who has specimen samples or in which other areas was used. I think this
      font deserves a better fate, maybe some digital foundry will decide to revive
      it.

  body: "I have a specimen titled \"Erbar Mediaeval Schriften\", it's from Ludwig
    & Mayer, beautifully letterpressed. It contains text faces, titling/display faces,
    ornaments, borders and examples of use, it's printed in black, red and yellow.
    I bought it and another specimen (that one's from 1936, I couldn't date this one)
    at our local market here in Hungary, for about 20$.\r\n\r\nThe text you have posted
    is definitely set in Erbar Mediaeval. There is another version of the capital
    \"T\" in my specimen, with the terminals angled outwards, not parallel."
