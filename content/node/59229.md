body: "Hi there\r\nI have been doing a case feature for Greek diacritical characters,
  so that the diacritical characters are replaced with the non-diacritical characters
  when the string is in uppercase. As you can see it works fine in the Fontlab preview
  panel:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontlab_5573.png]\r\n\r\nBut in
  InDesign (CS4) it keeps the dieresis and converts the tonos+dieresis into UC dieresis
  (I marked them in magenta). Is that an InDesign override, that acually makes it
  the way it should be? Or what?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/indesign_5049.png]\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nClaus"

    And yes, dieresis+tonos becomes just dieresis.\r\n\r\nAsk Gerry, he knows all
    about it ;^)"

  body: 'What Miguel said: the dialytika (dieresis) is retained because it is necessary
    to differentiate some words in which a sequence of two vowels can either be pronounced
    as a diphthong or independently. There is a related contextual rule that states
    that when an accent occurs on the first of two such vowel letters, in all-caps
    or smallcaps text this must be converted to a dialytika on the second vowel letter
    when the accent is supressed. In other words, there are two ways to indicate separate
    pronunciation of two vowel letters in sequence: a dialytika on the second vowel
    or an accent on the first vowel (an accent on the second vowel indicates an accented
    diphthong).'

  body: Thanks guys, I had a feeling that was the CASE. I'll go to my favourite witch
    doctor and summon Gerry.

  body: "Hmm, thanks Nick, but now my 'case' feature no longer works \u2013 even when
    I remove your code. It compiles with no errors, but toggling the case feature
    on and off in the preview panel does nothing. Very strange. Very very strange.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, how would I implement small caps in this code?"
