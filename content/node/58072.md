    out that the bottom word spells Industries. It made me read Indius Tries, too.

  body: "hm okay, I had a couple of other people say that too. I tried to fit it like\r\nEggroll\r\nIndus\r\nTries
    \r\n\r\nbecause it fits better than\r\nEggroll\r\nIndustries\r\n\r\nI'll try pulling
    that i down.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    very cool, just need a little fix with the \"i\" and linking Industries maybe
    a \"-\" (?)"
