  at all...\r\n\r\nI love the design of the sans-serif in the \"next\" clothing logo
  and would love to find the typeface used or a near substitute to use in my art potfolio\r\n\r\nhere's
  the logo with lower and (I presume in the same typeface) uppercase:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ukherd.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/NextDirLogo_071.jpg\r\n\r\nif
  anyone has any ideas please let me know, thanks\r\n\r\n"
