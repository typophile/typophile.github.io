  body: "I looked in several places, and looked at hundreds of simple scripts, but
    I could not find this font. Frankly, it looks like a personal font that anyone
    could make. A rather similar font I found was Paratype's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/nina/\">Nina</a>,
    but I think the odds of finding this exact font are very low.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
