  iPad app Hanx Writer. It recreates the sound, carriage returns, and other aspects
  of typewriters. Text can be copied and pasted. It's rather nice.\r\n\r\nThe app
  is free, but you can make optional in-app purchases of other typewriter fonts, different
  colored ribbons, etc.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hanx_3481.jpg]"

  body: "I tried it, but it doesn't quite work like the real thing. \r\n\r\nFor instance,
    by default, backspace deletes the character just before the cursor, as all modern
    text editors do. If you don't want that, there is an option to make it work like
    a real typewriter, except it doesn't work anything like a real typewriter. On
    a real typewriter, when you backspace, it moves the carriage back one character.
    If you want to \"delete\" something, you type X's over it. The way they implemented
    it, when you backspace, it puts an X over the character (overstrike) just before
    the cursor AND moves the cursor back one character, preceding the overstriked
    character. Consequently, when you resume typing, the overstriked text stays to
    the right of the cursor, and the new text is inserted before it. I'm hoping this
    is a bug and that they'll fix it, but who knows. Ultimately, such functionality
    is a bit silly, but if you're going to do it, at least get it right.\r\n\r\nAnother
    bug is that when you try to type an accented character, it crashes.\r\n\r\nThere
    are no options for adjusting line spacing, setting tabs and margins, or underlining.
    The automatic carriage return isn't very authentic. It should \"ding\" when you
    get near the right margin, reminding you to hit return before you run out of space
    (and when you do, the keys should stop working). Makes me wonder if they ever
    used a real typewriter. A rather superficial simulation (so far)."
