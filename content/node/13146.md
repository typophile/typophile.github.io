  body: I'd tighten up the AT combination at the beginning and the AS at the end.
    Don't look as the space between letters, look at the volume they are taking up.
    The A's tend to slope away from their neighboring letters creating an apperance
    of more space, so the letters next to them need to be adjusted to compensate.

  body: "My first reaction was similar to Dan's on the AT but I wonder if increasing
    the AT and TL space might compensate for what is always going to be a spacy righthand
    side, although the AS combination might be a gnat's tighter.\r\nTim"

  body: "You could either go for the tightness in \"LA\", in which case you need to
    tighten everything else, especially the \"AT\". Or you could go for the moderation
    in \"TL\" and \"AS\", in which case you need to tighten \"AT\" and loosen \"LA\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I don't know how big this is going to be, but you could try loosening the
    overall spacing, and rebalancing to match the invitably wide LA. \r\n\r\nGorgeous
    letters!\r\n\r\n"
