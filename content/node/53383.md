  was recently asked by my boss that he wanted me to completely re-design the logo,
  so this is what I had in mind.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me what you think, I actually
  need to hand it in by the end of this day (lol)\r\n\r\nOh, and the font is Helvetica
  (I'm pretty sure 99.99% of you guys can tell.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/redesign_6364.jpg]"

  body: "It could be helpful to know what this company is about which I'm sure you
    know. Personally, I like the helvetica bold. Depending on your illustrator skills
    I would keep the 'S' top and bottom continuations looking like the previous version.
    It needs to be cleaner obviously, and the top line could extend over the 'ense'
    and merge with the first uppercase L. \r\n\r\nIs there a reason for the italic?
    Is there a stroke around the uppercase 'C'? Good luck getting it done."

    I thought it looked more professional and had a feeling of \"we'll get the job
    fast and on time\"\r\n\r\nI actually tried the \"S\" like the original logo and
    it looked TERRIBLE, but thanks for your idea.\r\n\r\nBear"

  body: "I agree w/ aluminum. LLC really should take a back seat to the rest of the
    logo.\r\nYou might be able to omit it, and use 'LLC' in a byline, legal/footer
    etc.\r\n\r\nI like the improved Helvetica version. May be nitpicky, but try making
    the cap 'S' kiss the lc 'o' lightly -- and make all the letters that 'kiss' touch
    with the same convention -- ie lightly.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I know I'm late, but the most distinctive part of this logo is where the
    'L' meets the 'C', which is a problem since as the others have said, the \"LLC\"
    needs to be de-emphasized.\r\n\r\nThe logo isn't very memorable. It's missing
    something. Take the Microsoft logo for example (also set in tightly kerned Helvetica
    Bold Oblique). It's got the little notch in the 'o' to distinguish it from other
    Helvetica logos. I think this needs something like that at the very least.\r\n\r\n

  body: "well..first off the original logo is one of the worst things I've ever seen...absolute
    disaster....\r\n\r\n\r\nyou've got a long way to go with the re-design...it's
    just not really doing anything and it's not very easy on the eyes\r\n\r\n\r\n-
    look into incorporating the 3 point 'honeycomb' graphic from the original\r\n-
    de-emphasize 'LLC'\r\n- tinker around with the font...on this site you're bound
    to find something to lead you in the right direction...think modern...think versatile"
