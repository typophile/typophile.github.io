  a conference there and I'm preparing materials for a party event, so flamboyant
  or even tacky is okay (but more subtle looks are fine too as long as they suggest
  the city). Thanks."

    up my alley! \r\n\r\nI'd do up something in some design software, but if you want
    something ready made you could go with a neon-esque font...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/neon-lights.font\r\n\r\nOr,
    how about something triline...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/triline/fonts/\r\n\r\n...something
    inline...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/inline/fonts/\r\n\r\nPrismatic
    would be fun. \r\n\r\nWhat pt sizes are you using? Vegas is a dynamic town!!!"
