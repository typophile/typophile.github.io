  font? I think the designer tweaked it a little. But i'm thinking it's this font.\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to find a font for my hair business logo i'm designing and I love the smooth
  flowy lines of this.\r\n\r\ntia!\r\n\r\n"

    filled the m's little circle and extended the y's tail\r\n\r\nI found it using

  body: "I you consider the specific logo of \"siwydenim\" and most LC letters they
    are very close,\r\nbut there are also letters like capital B,E,G which are different
    enough.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think the overall feeling is very close and as long as
    you don't have to\r\nreproduce an existing work but you want to create something
    new \r\nis just a matter of personal taste\r\n"
