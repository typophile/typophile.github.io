    mentions Menlor Casual as a related typeface, but it doesn't seem to be commercially
    available in digital format, either:\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/14948000769/\r\n\r\nCorvinus
    has some of the flavor of Old Hamcherry and Menlor (capital letters), but isn't
    a very good match for the lowercase....\r\n\r\n"
