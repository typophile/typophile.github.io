  body: I think the center version works best (centered, letterspaced on one line,
    in one weight), but I would look at spacing it out just a tad more, and look at
    the kerning.

  body: The tension in the middle of the 'S' bothers me. Try pushing it inwards more
    for a shorter 'S' and more of a gap in the middle to reduce the tension. I like
    the one in the left best given that the "STUD" looks compressed in the middle
    version. The problem with the left version is that the 'C' and the 'S' doesn't
    align properly.

    look if the 'C's interlocked (black overlaps blue on left, blue overlaps black
    on right)? \r\n\r\nJust a note - Century Gothic is Monotype's \"rip-off\" version
    of Avant Garde. See <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/articlesarialsia.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">here</a> for more info. I'd recommend using either Avant Garde
    or Futura rather than Century Gothic.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    I switched to Avant Garde the endings on the 'C' changed quite a bit and that

  body: "Hmm... I hadn't really thought about it that way, Paul. I'll have to think
    about it for a little while to see if I can find a way to convey more flexibility.
    \r\n\r\nThough... I'm not really sure it needs to convey flexibility. They are
    a firm that specializes in plan implementation -- drafting development regulations
    and preparing infrastructure financing studies. On the one hand one might think
    \"a consultant should be flexible and accomodating to a clients needs,\" but on
    the other hand plans and regulations are notoriously inflexible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    the interlinking designs could communicate that unified, hand-in-hand partnership
    with the clients...?\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    of the symbol in terms of weight and composition, I think, if you go with that
    version you should look at amending the C of CODE to the same angled terminals

    that line.\r\nTim"
