  a new typeface. It's a remake of a hand lettering. The original draw was made by
  a Oporto's seller.\r\n\r\nHere is http://typophile.com/files/hamburg.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm
  showing here for ask your contribution and opinion. I have many doubts about how
  I can adapt the original design for new caracters. Can anyone help me?\r\nPlease,
  say what do you think about. Sugestions and critics are welcome.\r\nThanks."

    in adapt the original design for new caracters- the work so far is nice. In my
    point of view you have lots of \"good curves\" that can help you get all other
    characters...can you be more specific in what characters are you experience dificulties?\r\nConcerning
    the one that you made so far I want to point this:\r\nI- looks like e small i
    that has been scaled\r\nM- looks wide\r\nA- looks wide\r\n\r\nI made a small adaption
    in your file, hope that you dont mind :)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor\xE7a Portugal!\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hamburg1_5489.jpg]"
