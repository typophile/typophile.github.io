  \r\n\r\nI am in the business of writing formal reports that convince the reader
  of a particular argument - much like a lawyer just not as ultra formal. I currently
  use Calibri but I have decided to search for a different sans serif font as I have
  read that system fonts are generally poorly designed. \r\n\r\nI seek a sans serif
  font which is versatile enough to be used on screen and in print whilst holding
  the readers attention and maintaining legibility over long body copy. I would like
  a sans serif font that is interesting but maintains a certain degree of formality
  so as to remain credible.  \r\n\r\nI came across MVB Solitaire which seems to have
  had good reviews. I would greatly welcome any other suggestions from the community.
  \r\n\r\nYour advice is very much appreciated. \r\n\r\nMany thanks   \r\n"

  body: Calibri was done by Lucas de Groot and is not poorly designed and not all
    system fonts are generally poorly designed, that said, most are over used and
    finding a new font for your work output would set it apart from the "ordinary".  MVB
    Solitaire is an interesting font and would give your output a nice new look.

    body: "Bojev, thank you for the reply. \r\n\r\nI must admit that I don't dislike
      Calibri, however, as you say, setting my work apart from the ordinary is desirable.
      \r\n\r\nCould you recommend any alternatives to MVB Solitaire that would be
      worth considering ? To elaborate I am looking at redesigning my company's document
      framework (I have taken some pointers from Matthew Butterick's Practical Typography
      to try and enhance readability) and the last piece of the puzzle seems to be
      the font. Cost may be an issue so although paid professional fonts are sought
      after I would also welcome any affordable / free font recommendations. \r\n\r\nBest
      regards "

    body: "Hi Frode \r\n\r\nThank you for the reply. I've read your review and you
      state \"The central styles are spaced a little on the tight side for immersive
      reading. They are, however, ideal for shorter stretches of text, or a supp\xADor\xADting
      role in a bigger hierarchy.\" This suggests that such a font, in your opinion,
      would not be useful for my intended purposes i.e. long persuasive reports. Would
      this be an accurate interpretation ? \r\n\r\nBest regards"

  body: "You are correct. That is my opinion. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never typeset a book
    in a sans serif, but I have been using Fresco Sans for a magazine in a supportive
    role. It has a lot of flavour, which might be a dealbreaker, but the spacing is
    impeccable: ideal for text sizes. If you\u2019re typesetting Norwegian, you\u2019ll
    need to make some modifications though (obtain permission, or hire the foundry
    to do them).\r\n\r\nAnother typeface I have worked with that I consider suitable
    for extended text is FF Legato.\r\n\r\nSome other sans serifs I\u2019d like to
    look closer at in the future includes FF Milo, Seravek, FF Balance, DTL Haarlemmer
    Sans and DTL Documenta Sans."

  body: 'Beware of blanket statements like "all sans fonts are informal and plain"
    - a good sans can project a sense of  modernity and clarity. And on the other
    hand serifs can be stiff and fussy and project more of a schoolbook vibe. Readability
    and serifs is still an open discussion - well set sans can be very readable. Georgia,
    by the way, is a strong font and could be persuasive, but then I have seen Gill
    Sans do a good job as well. '

    or done this, though, We've only used Hypatia for display, where it worked very
    well indeed.\r\n\r\nA proven font family would be TheSans, using either the regular
    or semi-light for text. (We've set a number of art books with TheSans.) Of course,
    since it is proven, it's not the newest fad.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/thesans/thesans/styles/\r\n"

    like somebody asking for an opinion on a book he's written on a book review forum,
    and being told that a career choice comes first. This is Typophile, so the context
    is type. Chips on shoulders are best be left at the door.\r\n\r\nTheSans is a
    great design, but if it works well for an art book* it can't be a very good choice
    for this task. Specifically, I think it's too informal, too friendly here.\r\n\r\n*
    Central question: what kind of art? There's no way one typeface can be great for
    all genres.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
