    Do you want me to say if I think it could be an outline theft or a rip-off? If
    that so, I just don't know and don't have skills and knowledge to clearly state
    it. I only said it reminds me of. Period. Just like Pragmatik, Myers Sans and
    Foundry Monoline remind me of Eurostile but being totally different."

  body: "Okay, you two: settle down. The unusual treatment of the descenders leads
    me to believe that some enterprising Japanese type designer decided to repurpose
    Eurostile. Perhaps the marketing department (or, for that matter, the engineering
    department) of the train company can help you identify that person. I am willing
    to bet that it was a bespoke/custom job\u2026"

  body: "Thanks Nick to confirm my thought about Eurostile. I clearly don't know if
    it could have been created directly from it though. May be some custom typeface
    by Maniackers Design?\r\nFor the rest, I confirm what hrant said, I have also
    no problem with Ryuk ;) and, of course, hrant. Was simply a bit surprised reading
    hrant's message. Thought he's suspected some outline theft and was seeking my
    confirmation. English is obviously not my mother language and there's no voice
    in any message so I probably took his message too peremptorily and feared to unintentionally
    start another witch hunting and be flooded by :D"

    was designed by Yukihiro Nakamura (\u4E2D\u6751\u5F81\u5B8F) and was released
    in 1975 by Shaken (\u5199\u7814), which is a phototypesetting machine company.
    The other weights were developed by Shaken staffs under the supervision of Yukihiro
    Nakamura. The typeface was very popular in Japan before."

    Eurostile ;) It''s always interesting to find (good of course) alternatives to
    (this overused and too much cheesy to my taste) Eurostile and always a great pleasure
    to discover more about typefaces thanks to you. '
