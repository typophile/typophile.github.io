  it is time to call in the cavalary.\r\nPlease be so kind to look at the following
  file: http://regularworld.com/img/bg_foot.gif belonging to the eye pleasing http://regularworld.com.
  The creator used some kind of ornament font or perhaps it is part of a normal font
  family. Be as it may, who can identify this rather victorian looking ornament?\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\n\r\n"

    do you perhaps know simular fonts?"

  body: "I don't know if it's still part of the Bickham family, I have an old version
    called MM that doesn't seem to be available. It has a lot of bells and whistles
    - ornaments, special characters, etc. This ornament you have looks pretty standard,
    I'm just not sure which font family includes it.\r\n\r\nNat Vignette seems to
    have a lot of swashy ornaments\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/nat-vignette/\r\n\r\nas

  body: I wouldn't ever waste my time at font.com - which is essentially just an affiliate
    mirror for fonts.com, which has its own problems. The best way to find this sort
    of thing is to run a search for ornaments or fleurons at MyFonts, whose keywords
    and selection are currently the best (until -- and this is where my bias enters
    in -- FontShop.com relaunches within the next few weeks).

  body: It's the letter "y" from Nat Vignett One. Used the very same character for
    a logo, funny how great minds think alike :-)

  body: Actually it's the 'v' not the 'y'. Lucky guess on my part with that font -
    I was too lazy to look for the actual character.
