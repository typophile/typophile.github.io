body: Hello, <BR> <BR>At work we have an epson stylus pro 4000 since using it I have
  noticed that the type in anything I print out, on close inspection, is quite fuzzy.
  No clean curves. <BR> <BR>The problem is not with the fonts, its the same in all
  cases, and they print out perfect on other printers. The images print out great
  but the type is slightly rough. <BR> <BR>Am i expecting too much from this printer?
  or maybe is there a setting im unaware of that may help. <BR> <BR>Ive tried convert
  to outlines which results with the same outcome and the outlines fonts now print
  bolder, which i know shouldnt be the case. <BR> <BR>Any ideas greatly appreciated,
  <BR> <BR>David.

  body: First check that you are outputting to high resolution and using good paper.
    Most likely though, any PostScript rendering &#40;including fonts&#41; you need
    a Postscript RIP to process your files for the Epson. There are inexpensive software
    RIPs available that should help you.

  body: Chris, <BR> <BR>Thanks for replying. Here is an example of what im talking
    about the text is set at 12pt. I have Stylus RIP professional 2.0 but am confused
    with how this works, ive installed it and in preferences asked it to work in the
    background but still no use. <BR> <BR>Am i expecting too much from this printer,
    it just seems the quality is so lame. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/54645.jpg"

  body: I can&#39;t tell if your Stylus RIP is working.  Perhaps you might call Epson
    Tech? <BR>I recommend the Adesso from &#60;<a href="http://proofmaster.net" target="_blank">http://proofmaster.net</a>&#62;

  body: I&#39;ll second Chris&#39; comment about paper. With any inkjet printer, using
    good paper can make a huge difference in print quality. The right paper can minimize
    the bleed one gets at the edges of letters. <BR> <BR>Additionally, like most printers,
    yours has variable resolution. You want to make sure it is set to the highest
    possible resoltution in the printer driver. <BR> <BR>All that being said, I can&#39;t
    tell from that sample whether you&#39;re already at the maximum resolution or
    not. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thanks everyone, the problem was that the postscript RIP was installed but
    not added to the printer list or at least couldnt be, I uninstalled and installed
    it again, added to the printing list and now its printing type as clear as I imagine
    its going to get. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help.
