  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>This café is to be named Café Riva at Inverkip Marina, Scotland.</p>
<p>The proposed identity is fairly modern that uses graphic interpretations of a cup of coffee and yacht sails. You will notice that it uses Avant Garde Gothic alternatives. I love them but have never used them in a logo before.</p>
<p>[[http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva-Concept01.jpg]]</p>
<p>The shop front picture is not the actual café, it’s just an example of how it could look.</p>
<p>[[http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva-Concept02.jpg]]</p>
<p>This identity is still in development and I have other ideas, but felt this one was the strongest. I would appreciate any constructive comments please.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Information regarding their clientele (current and desired) would also help. As it stands, I think it&rsquo;s a little to close to sailboat than coffee. The blue might be the tipping point.</p>
<p>Additionally, you seem to have left out the accent on the É.</p>
<p>On a side note, this reminds me of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIA_Rail|VIA Rail]] logo but I hardly think that&rsquo;s a concern all the way in Scotland. Just an observation. If there any old disco fan&rsquo;s that hang out there it might remind them of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boney_M.|Boney M]]. They used Avant Garde &ldquo;alternates&rdquo; a lot in their album art.</p>
<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;m old and I don&rsquo;t go to coffee shops.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Christopher above that there&rsquo;s a heavy ocean feel here — tropical water, I&rsquo;d say  — but that may be intentional. Also, I think the blue shapes surrounding the logo are a little much; the first black and white version feels much stronger as a mark. It works better on the shop signage and the blue line serves well as a graphic element (I really do see that blue line as water now) on the menu etc., but I&rsquo;d perhaps try incorporating the colour scheme into that first black and white version.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think it depends on what kind of cafe shop that you specifically design this logo for it, like the space, the environment, and who is the customer. If it is a hip, young, disco, fun cafe shop. I think it would be perfect for it.</p>
<p>Set that aside, I agree with Christ &amp; Collin, it does have ocean feel, blue cool breeze water and sail boat. I don&rsquo;t know if it is only just me, but I have hard time to read CAFE, it does look like OAFE.</p>
<p>The blue line under the text makes it look like the ocean with white sailing boat boat float on top. What if you reverse the color, blue shape fill in the letter, and white background, no underline.</p>
<p>I think you should put some more different version, so everybody can give you some more feedbacks.</p>

Have you thought about using a lighter version of the font (which I think would improve the graphic elements) &amp; perhaps giving the &lsquo;coffee&rsquo; a moka colour?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the detailed comments. Really interesting points. Good to have fresh eyes look at this identity.</p>
<p>I will try out the recommendations and post them here.</p>
<p>Inverkip Marina, is one of the largest marinas in the west of Scotland not too far from Glasgow. There is a big sailing community based there along with related industries. The demographic is fairly affulent and the café will be based on a busy road. My cousin works at the marina and he thinks the café should do well. The café is basically a side line for a yacht repair business and will be located at their premises rather than near other shops.</p>
<p>The café has not been fitted out yet, but it will use modern materials and fittings.</p>
<p>I will post revised concepts shortly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">From a typographic point of view I just dislike the usage of Avant Garde at all. Because it is a typeface which violates the very spirit of script without gaining <em>anything</em> for it. 
However, I like the colours and the idea with the sails is charming. With a more lively, sympathetic typeface, a bit more elegance, perhaps a more calligraphic approach you may end up at a really sparkling solution.
Good luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks the for comments Andreas. Yes, Avant Garde is everywhere and I shouldn&rsquo;t have used it but it suited the sail idea quite well. Anyway, the client has deemed this solution too modern. So it was back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>I have now proposed a more retro and continental look with subtle nautical references. The restaurant will offer Italian style food, coffee, etc.</p>
<p>The interior designer is proposing a classic American style, with a minimal slightly Shaker feel. No clutter, a nice clean look.</p>
<p>A earlier comment in this thread stated the accent was missing from the &lsquo;E&rsquo; in Café. This inspired me to make it boat shaped.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;E&rsquo; acts as pier found at marinas. Abstract I know, but most folks should see the boat shape at least. Maybe it&rsquo;s too big, I need to play around with it.</p>
<p>If the client likes the approach I will tweak it and explore more colourways, and perhaps typefaces. The figure of 8 knot in the divider line needs more work also.</p>
<p>You can view the concepts here:

		<div class="commentbody">The whole thing is too constructed, too stiff. The main Capital line is badly spaced, its texture appearing much disturbed. The ends of the underline terminate too short. The knot is not really visible. The boaty acute – does not really add wit to it.
There’s far too much thinking in the design. On the other hand, a maritime breeze of air and the smell of fresh coffee is missing …
Forgive me for being so rudely honest.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I feel that your approach is correct, by trying to find something unique about the area to incorporate into the logo.
The directions you&rsquo;ve been exploring seem to be more fitting of a coffee distribution company, a bit more corporate, more refined, and to me they lack personality. I think of a cafe to be inviting, somewhere you want to have a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned that your client rejected the first idea, because it was too modern. Although, maybe you should revisit that idea. Ask yourself what would that logo look like if it took on a different personality. Use that logo as a starting point and move away from it, change the colors, thin out the line, strip away the pieces, take them apart, and then reassemble them. Think of those elements as your palette.</p>
<p>Regarding color, blue isn&rsquo;t a color closely associated with food and drink. It does not inspire people to eat. Research has shown that blue decreases one&rsquo;s appetite.</p>
<p>I also agree with &ldquo;aluminum&rdquo; —using the logotype on the bathroom doors is diluting the strength of the identity. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to brand bathroom doors with the same emphasis as the logo that&rsquo;s representing food product.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the new logo has the local home business feel to it, because I seen a lot of small coffee shop use coffee cup logo.</p>
<p>We probably seen, lot of coffee cup, sun, smoke logo for ages. I don&rsquo;t mean the new logo is bad, but people would recognize it as coffee logo right away. If you want to break away from it, you could use other image, as a symbol, metaphor, etc that represents the business. Look at Starbuck for example.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, after looking at the store front—what it really needs is an awning over the door. (Similar to the attached photo.)
That will make the place feel a bit more inviting. You may want to recommend teak wood trim around the door too.
Then you can literally provide them with a hand-drawn logo type. Make the place feel like it&rsquo;s serving hand roasted coffee and hand baked goods.<img src="/images/old-images/idea_3497.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks again for the comments. The shop front is not the actual café. I like the approach in MarcDavid photo, although it&rsquo;s a fairly common and there is no real idea in the identity, just nice handwritten type. Perhaps that&rsquo;s all it needs to be.</div>
