  body: "I think it looks like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica-neue/|Helvetica
    Neue]] that has been vertically stretched a bit. The angle stroke on the top of
    the t seems off, but the letters look quite close to Helvetica to me.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I don't think it is any version of Helvetica. That lowercase \"a\" top arch
    doesn't come down and end flat like Helvetica.  The bowl of the \"d\" has a straight
    side on the right, whereas Helvetica's is round. The top of the \"t\" is cut at
    a diagonal unlike Helvetica's.\r\n\r\nTrade Gothic or News Gothic is closer but
    still not there.\r\n\r\nInteresting, the \"o\" is slightly egg-shaped to my eye.
    I wonder if that's a feature, or a bug.\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: "Those are good points Tom -- I can see my choice was off. The shape of the
    'a' bowl is what pushed me towards Helvetica, and the tail of the 'a'. The Trade/News
    Gothics don't have those. Maybe it's a different foundry's approximation of Helvetica?\r\n\r\n-

  body: This is pre-Helvetica, I'll bet. A <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/sans_gothic_grotesque/">grotesque/gothic</a>,
    not a neo-grotesque. My closest matches are <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/scangraphic/venus_sb_roman/?&sample_text=today&sample_size=74">Venus</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/monotype_grotesque_std_light/">Monotype
