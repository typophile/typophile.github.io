  had any suggestions for a font(s) that could accompany the main brand fonts which
  are [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_plekflek/example01.html|foundryflek
  & plek]]. \r\n\r\nThe accompanying font(s) can't be display fonts though, they are
  more for legibility and especially for the web. The font(s) don't have to be system
  fonts though as the text used for web is embedded inside flash, so no worries there.\r\n\r\nWould
  love any helpful suggestions as I'm sick of always sticking to good old Helvetica
  Neue.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"
