body: "Hey yo,\r\nI'm looking for some contemporary serif typefaces with interesting
  italics to be used for pullquotes and headers in a women's magazine.\r\n \r\nThe
  sort of thing I'm looking for:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_oxtail.html\">Oxtail</a>\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_remon.html\">Remontoire</a>\r\n(straight
  from typophile's very own Stefan Hattenbach!)\r\n\r\nFaces like <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/fstore/default.asp?fcode=248&search=Kursivschrift\">Kursivschrift</a>
  are right up the same alley as well, if not perhaps a bit overused.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts
  you guys might have on this would be greatly appreciated."
