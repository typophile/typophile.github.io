body: "Hi all,\r\nI have seen references to having specific end of line forms, but
  am having no luck getting them to actually work in an application. The font I am
  working on has a lot of contextual substitutions. I'm using FL5 and InDesign CS
  to test. In FL preview I can get both beginning and ending of WORD and LINE to work.
  In Indesign CS, The beginning of both line and word work fine, but only the end
  of word substitution works here. Is there a way for the end of line to be recognized
  in InDesign for this to work. My plan was to have end of line swashes substituted
  by more elaborate swashes using the ss00 feature, but obviously that won't work
  if the initial sub doesn't get placed. "

    All that can be checked is whether a glyph's context consists of certain other
    glyphs.\r\n\r\nSo, it is not possible to define <em>line</em> beginning/ending
    contexts. What is possible however is defining <em>word</em> beginning/ending
    with help of a trick: There is a word beginning/ending if no other letter (a b
    c ...) precedes or follows it:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/19839\r\nI think there
    were one or two more recent threads about this but I cannot find them.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

    feature. I've used both at times but still can't vary the results.\r\nThe word
    boundaries all work fine and the beginning of line recognizes the @All class and
    subs. I just can't get the end of line to work and get the end of word substitute
    instead.\r\nStephen"

  body: "Again, I cannot think of any reliable way to identify line boundaries in
    OT. The space character is not a reliable partner for these kinds of affairs.\r\n\r\nAt
    first I thought of a trick like this:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) <em>ignore sub
    e' @letter; sub e' by e.wordend;</em>\r\nAll end-of-word e's are turned into wordend
    e's. This identifies word boundaries only by the fact that no letter follows.
    Forget about space.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2a) <em>ignore sub e.wordend' [space
    nbspace]; sub e.wordend' by e.lineend;</em>\r\nIf no space follows (= line end),
    e.wordend becomes e.lineend.\r\nBut this is not a good context since a line break
    may very well be preceded by a space ... So we could try adjust (2a) a little:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2b)
    <em>ignore sub e.wordend' @space @letter; sub e.wordend' by e.lineend;</em>\r\nWhere
    @space = [space nbspace] and possible other space glyphs.\r\nThe application <em>may</em>
    include a line break character. If so, the ignore statement's context is not matched,
    and e.wordend substituted by e.lineend.\r\nBut this too may not be reliable because
    different applications behave differently as regards automatic line breaks. I
    found that in some applications contexts are broken if an automatic line break
    interferes (InDesign), while in other applications the automatic line break is
    treated as non-existing (Mellel). [Things may have changed. I tested this one
    or two years ago.] So you would not get the same result in all OT-savvy applications.\r\nAnd
    as said above, space it not really reliable since applications may use another
    character than space or nbspace, which would break your context definitions.\r\n\r\nMy
    example code is speculative -- I have not actually tested it.\r\nAnd for the downsides
    mentioned I would suggest that you deal with word-end letters in calt as you do,
    but for line-end letters better do single substitution in aalt or an ssXX feature
    so designers would assign the feature to *individual* letters. As much as I like
    automatism, in this case it would do more harm than good.\r\n\r\nP.S. And only
    in a third step (lookup) substitute e e' by e.alt."

  body: "Thanks Ralf and Karsten.\r\nSince the only thing not working is the end of
    line glyph subs I might just set those up in one of the ss00 features as I have
    with other embellished letters. More work for the end user, but also more control
    on their end. I will probably have to reorder my stylistic sets around a bit,
    but its worth the trouble. I didn't realize InDesign would automate a space at
    the end. I knew there was a lot going on though so I even tried the substitution
    with right flush on and no luck. One of the threads here on Zaphino implied it
    could be done contextually. Also I think a pdf of Cezanne implies the same. Too
    bad. It was working so nicely in the FL OT preview.\r\nIf anyone else has experience
    with end of line substitution I'd still love to hear how they work it. I do wonder
    if maybe too much automatic substitution might at times be working against the
    end user. thats probably fodder for another thread.\r\nThanks again.\r\nStephen"
