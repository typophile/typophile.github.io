  body: This layered lettering may not be the way the &#39;font&#39; comes at all,
    since this is a fairly simple trick of layering a white copy of the letters between
    two black copies. You could make something similar by horizontally stretching
    almost any sans font, and then making the layered copies.

  body: There is also a Red Rooster font called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/steelplate-gothic-rr/shaded/testdrive.html?s=P+E+P+I&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Steelplate Gothic</a> that has a very similar look.
