body: "I'm building a typeface with multiple glyphs per character, and each time I
  try to compile the font I get a fatal error:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_6085.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_3737.gif]\r\nHere's
  a sample of the code:\r\n<code>feature salt { \r\n sub A from [A.alt1 A.alt2 A.alt3];\r\n
  sub B from [B.alt1 B.alt2 B.alt3];\r\n sub C from [C.alt1 C.alt2 C.alt3];\r\n sub
  D from [D.alt1 D.alt2 D.alt3];\r\n sub E from [E.alt1 E.alt2 E.alt3];\r\n sub F
  from [F.alt1 F.alt2 F.alt3];\r\n sub G from [G.alt1 G.alt2 G.alt3];\r\n} salt;</code>
  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_3737.gif]\r\nI have three alts
  (.alt1 .alt2 .alt3) for A-Z a-z encoded in the same way. If I delete all of the
  subs up to sub D, it will compile just fine. Go into Indesign, look in the glyph
  pallet, and the alternates all show up just fine:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ishot-3_4086.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_3737.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  don't understand why it's not working. Any help?"

  body: Worked on it for hours, and 30 seconds after I post asking for help, I figure
    it out. I hadn't created a few of the default characters yet, but the alts were
    already there...

  body: Because I haven't figured out how to program all of the dang alternates and
    swooshes. You think if I posted a larger sample, people might help me figure out
    the programming needed to make it work?

  body: "Dan,\r\nMany of the error messages are pretty cryptic in FL. Most of the
    time it is simple stuff like a typo inserting a comma instead of a period or forgetting
    the semicolon. Usually, when there is a glyph missing, you get an error saying
    \"Glyph \"x\" is missing, would you like FontLab to generate it for you?\" I think
    you must always have the base glyph finished though for FL to have the broth to
    make the soup :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: Keep up the good work, Dan!"
