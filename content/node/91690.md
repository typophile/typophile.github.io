body: "Hi, I am working on a FMCG product range for a dairy company, and had initially
  chosen Museo Slab (500) as my supporting font family... Unfortunately I have to
  find another font, so after numerous hours of searching I have yet to fint one that
  suits the purpose. The product range is for a cream cheese product and so I initially
  wanted the serifs to be 'cream-like'. I currently have Vista Slab as a good nr.2
  option, but I am not convinced.. Any help would be much appreciated! (attached sample
  of Vista Slab and Museo Slab)\r\nThanks heaps! \xAE"

    them up for further developement. I have also found another candidate which I
    will present. Fontin by Jos Buivenga, who also designed Museo.\r\nhttp://www.exljbris.com/fontin.html\r\n\r\n\u2014
    Thanks again for your input!\r\n"
