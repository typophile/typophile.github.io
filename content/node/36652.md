  body: "I think you might be right about Expletive Lex, but I think a bit of customization
    has been applied, or alse all the optional characters are not shown. For example
    the 'f' could be made by flipping a second 'f' (notice the loops look symmetrical?),
    and editing a bit. The 'n' also seems to have been edited from something else,
    but the a, c and y look exactly the same to me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The Fancy logo is a custom design created in-house at Veer by Drew Ng. There
    is certainly a bit of serendipitous inspiration from Barnbrook\u2019s Expletive
    Script, but Drew\u2019s original sketches indicate that many other point of reference
    were used as well."
