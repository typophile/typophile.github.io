body: "Since I cannot add posts to http://typophile.com/node/6268 :\r\n\r\nI would
  like to provide an update: Nick Shinn has elected to\r\nbe the first person to take
  up my offer*. He has also taken\r\nup my offer of not instant-messaging him, for
  which all any-\r\nbody ever has to do is ask**. Please, people, don't be shy:\r\nfreely
  join the \"Hrant filter\", at any level. I promise not\r\nsend my boys to break
  your shins... Also: this does not mean\r\nthat such a person should not in turn
  communicate with me.\r\nI'm open, 24-7, all channels.\r\n\r\n* See Nick's last post
  here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/15819?from=50&comments_per_page=50\r\n\r\n**
  I wish \"you cannot not communicate\" were always true...\r\n\r\nThe main reason
  for this is that I love Typophile, and I\r\nthink this helps Typophile. An even
  more selfish reason\r\nhowever is simply that I would enjoy Typophile more when\r\npeople
  are not complaining about something that I see as\r\ntotally natural and needed.\r\n\r\nAs
  you were.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
