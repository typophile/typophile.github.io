  HREF="http://www.fontbureau.com" TARGET="_top">Font Bureau</A> did a few faces for
  Martha including Benton Gothic and  <BR>Welo Script, a beautiful thing. Sadly, FB
  has removed their custom type  <BR>pages since the redesign on their site and I
  couldn&#39;t find a google  <BR>cache for them.'

    in retail? Sure, people looking <BR>for custom type aren&#39;t going to be drawn
    through <BR>a website, but word-of-mouth is huge, come on! <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;ve
    recently seen Seria Sans used <BR>in some Conde Nast publication, but now <BR>I
    can&#39;t remember which. <BR> <BR>hhp '
