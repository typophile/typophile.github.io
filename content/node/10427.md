  WhatTheFont, etc.&#41; but I&#39;m not having any luck so far. <BR> <BR>I cobbled
  together the attached sample which is almost the whole upper-case.  <BR> <BR><img

  font from ABC&#39;s &#34;Eyes&#34;"> <BR> <BR>Thanks for looking!

  body: It&#39;s pretty close to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/coniglio/nomad/nomad/nomad"
    target="_blank">Nomad</a> but not exact. It reminds me of those numbers and letters
    you can buy at hardware stores, which while unlikely, may be what they did.

    the same &#34;enough&#34;.   <BR> <BR>Sorry, I guess I shoulda mentioned that
    sooner.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"

    match. Sort of.
