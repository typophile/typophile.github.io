  and was wondering what the consensus is on making small caps for the italic weights?
  Are they necessary? A typographic faux pas? A waste of time?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "As a typographer I don\u2019t use them, but I see that many people do. Italic
    small caps are used not very often, but let\u2019s say that a designer decides
    to set the subheads in small caps. If a subhead contains the title of a book,
    the designer most likely will feel the need to mark this distinction (FIFTY YEARS
    OF <em>RAYUELA</em> instead of FIFTY YEARS OF RAYUELA). The options are:\r\n1)
    ignore it and set all the text in regular small caps (but the editor may not agree).\r\n2)
    slant the regular small caps (I did this once, worked right).\r\n3) the most common
    procedure: set the title in italic and use the small caps button, no matter if
    the typeface has real small caps or not. (Aaaaargh!)\r\n\r\nSo, as a type designer,
    I feel it\u2019s better to provide small caps for all the fonts that have some
    chance to be used in long texts and/or subheads."

    they offer a nice option in titles when used with swash caps. Maybe this is just
    my eccentricity, but I like the look. '

  body: "Small caps are a <em>need</em> in italics.\r\n\r\nMost people just think
    of them as an option to subheads or emphasis. But in a properly typeset text,
    acronyms must be in small caps too. So, if you have a text in italic and there
    you have an acronym like UNESCO, you will need this feature in the font.\r\n\r\nThe
    main reason for me not to use some fonts is because its italics don't have small
    caps.\r\n"

  body: "I personally think that you could use regular small caps in a text set in
    italics, as some printers did in the past. But I agree that the vast majority
    of designers and editors will be with Freiberger. That\u2019s why I am including
    them in Espinosa Nova (small caps in regular, italic, bold, and bold italic)."
