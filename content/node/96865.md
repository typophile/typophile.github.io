body: "Hi !\r\nI'm responsible of a website for an association, it's happened very
  recently, and i have to make a new version of this site.\r\nMy problem is that nobody
  know what kind of font first webmaster used... I tried some site where you can recognize
  a font by asking some questions (like is it a font with or without a serif ?), but
  it didn't work...\r\n\r\nI'm a bit depressed, because i don't know how to find it,
  that's why i'm here...\r\n\r\nThis is the onely image i have : [URL=http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=783432logognubfondblanc.png][IMG]http://img15.hostingpics.net/thumbs/mini_783432logognubfondblanc.png[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nI
