  body: 'Things were lighter this year than last. Chalk it up to  <BR>trimmed marketing
    budgets or perhaps people&#39;s  <BR>hesitancy to travel on the anniversary of

    A  <BR>great magazine. They&#39;ve moved away from their former  <BR>dumbed-down,
    plug-in tips and software tricks into a  <BR>much more intelligent read. There&#39;s
    also a good piece  <BR>on <A HREF="http://www.mvbfonts.com/" TARGET="_blank">Mark

    <BR>Quark was there, sort of. If you count one guy  <BR>occupying a bar stool
    and laptop stand. &#34;We don&#39;t do  <BR>trade shows&#34; was the rep&#39;s
    explanation of Quark&#39;s new  <BR>policy. <BR> <BR>Asking about the upcoming
    Quark release, he said I&#39;d  <BR>be blown away by all the nifty features coming
    in Quark  <BR>6, due Q1, 2003. He quickly added that he&#39;d have to kill  <BR>me
    if he told me all of them. I think he was bluffing.  <BR>Regarding OpenType support
    for the new version: of  <BR>course. But don&#39;t look for full access to all
    OT features  <BR>until 7.0. Where does that put us, 2006? <BR> <BR>How could I
    not feel bad for this guy? He&#39;s representing  <BR>the market leader in layout
    software, sitting in the  <BR>shadow of the buzzing Adobe pavillion across the
    aisle.  <BR>What these guys need is a serious cash infusion &#40;for  <BR>product
    development and marketing&#41;. <BR> <BR><B><A HREF="http://www.fontreserve.com/"
    TARGET="_blank">Font Reserve</A></B> <BR>This app looks much cooler than I expected.
    I&#39;ve never  <BR>tried it, but I&#39;m downloading the <A HREF="http://www.fontreserve.com/products/trial_mac.html"
    TARGET="_blank">free trial</A> as I write this. <BR>There are the usual features,
    like creating sets and  <BR>creating type sample books--stuff you could print
    for  <BR>reference. But there are some handy features I wasn&#39;t  <BR>familiar
    with, like searching or sorting fonts by genre  <BR>and foundry.  <BR> <BR>What
    I really miss &#40;now that I&#39;m using OS X&#41; is the ATM  <BR>Deluxe feature
    that auto-activates fonts from the  <BR>background, even if ATM itself is not
    open, and  <BR>regardless of whether you have a set &#39;active.&#39; That&#39;s  <BR>technology
    you can use.'

    has a mechanical oblique, plus the money is tight these days &#40;especially in
    type design&#41;, why in hell are we making &#34;true&#34; italics? Is it some
    kind of coping mechanism or something? <BR> <BR>hhp '
