  insightful page. The rest of the website has alot to offer as well, but here it
  is:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thedieline.com/blog/features-top-packaging-advice/\r\n\r\nI

  failed identities share:\r\n\r\nGlobal logos that do not consider global interpretations\r\nLogos
  that need an \u201Cexplanation\u201D\r\nOverly \u201Ctrendy\u201D logos\r\nLogos
  that require complicated production techniques\r\nLogos that require in-depth training
  in which to educate users\r\nLogos with multiple taglines or messages that are not
  always in sync</code>\r\n\r\nand thinking of how those are some very good guidelines
  for logos..\r\n\r\nanyway, back to the all-nighter project.\r\n\r\nenjoy\r\n\r\n"
