body: "Hi TypoPhiles,\r\n\r\nI'm in a Typography class at my school and this week
  we had to find a poster created during the digital revolution. Attached is the one
  I found. We have to also discuss the typefaces used in the poster and since I couldn't
  find any info on the web about the ones in this poster I thought I would ask the
  experts here.\r\n\r\nIf you could help me with this I would really appreciate it.
  Thanks!"

  body: If you look closely at <em>Beyond Infinity</em> you can see brushstrokes.
    That's pretty conclusive evidence that it was hand-painted.
