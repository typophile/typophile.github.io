  body: "I see fashion as well, especially when it's surrounded by so much whitespace.
    The '1' does feel heavy.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with it, but there's nothing
    that makes me say \"wow\" either.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Seems to be a bit under-designed for a design company logo. I know one shouldn't
    overdo a logo for a design business, but one shouldn't under-do it either.

  body: "To me it would be new and fresh ... if this was 1971.\r\nAs a design firm,
    I think you should either have a logo that is really, really good/creative/innovative/informative.\r\nOr
    don't have a logo. (ie deliberate understatement)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nof all the
    fishes in the sea\r\nthe little mermaid is one for me"
