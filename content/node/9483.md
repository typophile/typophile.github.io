  to conclude my investigations, and who else better to put the question to than typophile,
  replies will be most appreciated. <BR> <BR>Typography...what is the future?

    <BR> <BR>You are asking a pretty vague question.

    all, he is Italian. ::wink:: On the other hand, in the conversations &#40;via
    e-mail&#41; I have had with him I&#39;ve notice that he, Alessandro, thinks very
    theoretically and doesn&#39;t rely on the obvious to solve his problems. <BR>
    <BR>Would it be possible for you to post your findings thus far?'

  body: Alex/Rifty, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re still reading this thread/site,
    but I don&#39;t think anybody meant any offense. The future tends to make people
    edgy. But to be fair, anybody who knows the future won&#39;t be here discussing
    it... <BR> <BR>I think, I hope, that the future of type will be something highly
    organic and functional, something that can look beyond both chirography and constructivism,
    something that can start approaching what humanity really needs, as opposed to
    what turns on a clique of artistes, free from fear of the lack of control in life
    and free from selfish creativism/expressionism. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Ah, a typical Modernist reaction. :-&#41;  No matter what you say or do,
    they end up telling you &#34;that&#39;s just Modernism&#34;, &#34;you&#39;re a
    Modernist, you just don&#39;t realize it&#34;, etc. After all, everything has
    to fit within their box, otherwise it can&#39;t exist. If it can&#39;t be counted,
    it doesn&#39;t count. In fact this is part of the very difference between Mondernism
    and what I&#39;m getting at: the naive lust for Total Formal Control, which I
    feel is against what humans really need. Control is sooooo 2nd millennium, dude.

  body: "1. Methinks (and I don't consider myself a full professional) we will see
    more bigger and diversified font families in the future. People will want to have
    a sans-serif accompanied by a serif, a script, grunge, inline and so on to save
    them the trouble of matching fonts. Multilingual support will become more important
    and the overall size of font files will increase. China will get on board with
    an increasing demand for kanji versions of fonts, and they should be well matched.\r\n\r\n2.
    Fonts will be not only more diverse, but will be designed for devices with better
    and better resolution that will surpass the resolution of the eye. We'll see 30\"
    Retina displays in the near future, and fonts for them. Probably devices themselves
    will be as thick as paper, and will be able to be folded - thus no separation
    between tablet, monitor, computer, smartphone. \r\n\r\n3. By analogy with TV,
    type will probably move out of black and white territory and become colourful
    by design. You will be able to do design much more easily, MS Word will be able
    to do much of the stuff Photoshop does now. Maybe there will be better possibilities
    for animation of type, spawning a row of \"kinetic typography of my laundry list\"
    - type of design, same as with flash and it's \"skip intro\"\r\n\r\n4. All in
    all, people will become much more lazy and difficult to entertain. They will want
    EVERYTH1NG, N()W! A simple well-made font, 2-3 weights, some italics - that won't
    be able to suffice. In an ecology of information overflow and a gazillion fonts,
    only the biggest families will be able to hold their own.\r\n\r\n"
