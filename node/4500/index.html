		<div class="commentbody">Brian <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been a fine press printer-publisher for 28-1/2 years now, so I might have some words of advice though not necessarily of wisdom. Hire where you need. A good copy editor/proof reader is essential. If you are a writer, typographic designer, illustrator, you are already on your way to having the book completed. Which means no publisher is going to be interested, but they weren&#39;t going to be anyway. Publish it yourself. A fine and honorable tradition.  <BR> <BR>I had a manuscript a few years back that I shopped around a bit and then decided, hey, I&#39;ll just print this up on my laser printer &#40;I&#39;m actually a letterpress printer&#41;. It was, I have been told, the first laser printed book marketed to the trade. It&#39;s been like a little fast cash ATM machine. I was lucky though, it was a technical manual on an arcane subject and people wanted the information.  <BR> <BR>First I guess, is ask yourself, who beside &#34;me&#34; is going to be interested in this? and why? If it is pure self-indulgence, and there is nothing wrong with that mind you, you might think long and hard about the investment in money and labor, and will you be okay with that if as you say, the response is not to your hope. And by the way, most likely it won&#39;t. Publishing is more miss than hit. Hard to swallow but I have a lot of books in storage boxes that can attest to that. <BR> <BR>Gerald</div>
