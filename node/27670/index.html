  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Everyone,

I am currently in the market for a new scanner. The reviews at online shops haven't really been helping me much because I am not really sure where my standards should be set. Ultimately I want to be able to scan photos, patterns and textures for design projects as well as font sketches for typeface development. 

I was interested in the Microtek s400, but then I read some reviews that called it slow and one even said that it doesn't work with Mac OSX.

Does anyone out there have any advice on what I should be looking for? What do you use? How do you like it? How much should I expect to spend? Do certain brands work better with Macs and Adobe CS?

I really appreciate any advice or guidance you may have,

Also, Firewire is good. Nothing will be fast at high resolutions. There is another scanner thread that is recent you might look at.</div>

Does anyone out there have a MicroTek s400 or i800? I like what I have seen about these 2, but since they are not as popular it is difficult to get input from someone other than marketing writers.

		<div class="commentbody">Vendor code. Sry to be cryptic. Talking about scanning software that is created in-house by the manufacturer of the scanner. Many scanners bundle software with scanners that is buggy, and if it does work they may not support it so it may not work with the next OS upgrade.

SilverFast is very powerful and can make the best of a lower end scanner IMO.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well I found a pretty good deal on the Microtek s400 at the store today so I went ahead and got it. I've got it hooked up to my PowerBook and everything seems to be running nicely. For now I am using the "Vendor Code" along with Photoshop and my test scans are nice and clear. 

I looked into it and SilverFast is available for the s400. Based on jupiterboy's opinion and other reviews I read online I am planning to buy SilverFast in the near future. Sounds like that should prevent software problems in the future and it should help me avoid "buggy" bundled software issues.

Thank you for your help. I'll definitely post updates if I run into any note-worthy problems or magnificent revelations.

SilverFast is a relaitvely deep program. Where most scanners lack is in the ability to pull out details in shadows. SilverFast allows you to do all your correction that you might do in photoshop directly in the scan. With some practice you will be able to get as much dynamic range as you possibly can out of your hardware. Yes, it completely replaces the native software, comes with custom transforms for your scanner and interfaces with photoshop. It also has little how-to videos that can be activated at various stages to help on the learning curve.

Good things: 
 It is working fine with colored pictures. 
 It is also fast!  
 Not expensive.

Bad thing:
 Not bad and Not very good in black & white.
 I am not sure if it will live for a long time!
 Doesn't scan slides.
