body: After reading some of the great threads on spec work here, <a href="http://www.google.com/codejam/">
  this move by Google</a> just pisses me off. Basically they&#39;re getting a whole
  bunch of naive young programmers to do work for way less compensation &#40;the average
  payout including only the 500 qualifiers is $50&#41; than they&#39;d make were they
  actually employed by Google. <BR> <BR>Google is having a recruiting infosession
  here next week. Maybe I will go and yell at them.

    programme my way out of a paper bag.

  body: Yeah, I guess looking it over more closely it&#39;s slightly different, since
    you&#39;re not submitting a complete body of work to Google and then having it
    done whatever with.

  body: 'Someone recently sent me this: <BR> <BR>&#34;King County Bar Association
    is seeking proposals for a redesign of its logo. [...] All submissions must be
    accompanied by assignment of all intellectual property rights to KCBA, and must
    be camera-ready.  An ideal design might reflect the emphasis on justice and professionalism
    that has defined KCBA since 1886, and should not include scales, courthouses,
    or blindfolded women. Favorable attention will be paid to designs suitable for
    trademarking. The winning design may be used on KCBA letterhead, business cards,
    and other collateral materials, however, KCBA reserves the right to not use it.
    Regardless of how the entry is used, the winning designer will receive $250 plus
    special recognition in the Bar Bulletin and at the KCBA Annual Dinner in June
    2004.&#34; <BR> <BR>So to sum up: do the work for free, sign away all your legal
    rights before we announce the winner &#40;so that we can legally use ANY of the
    designs we receive&#41; and if you win our little lottery you get a whopping $250.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>&#34;Emphasis on justice and professionalism&#34; indeed. <BR>'

  body: Why, there oughta ba a law... All kidding aside, it&#39;s work like this that
    tempts amateurs and amateurs attempting to make the transition to professional
    status. I mean it&#39;s a portflio piece for a professional organization...Oh
    wait &#34;assignment of all intellectual property rights to KCBA&#34;, aw shucks.
    Not only is a situation like the KCBA contest bad for the designer it&#39;s bad
    for the KCBA too. The association won&#39;t know what to do with their logo without
    direction, and they&#39;ll come out looking pretty bad. But then, you get what
    you pay for.

    little more ethically.
