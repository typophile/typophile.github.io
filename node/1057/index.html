  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was listening to the radio the other night. A musician  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was talking about making music. He sounded a little out <!-- raw HTML omitted --> of it, he was rambling a little, but had a good point to <!-- raw HTML omitted --> make. He mentioned the state of pop music, the rigidly <!-- raw HTML omitted --> enforced planned obsolesence of it and how his music  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was trying to be as honest as possible. Authentic. He  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->then said (bear with me) something like this: &quot;I mean, it  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shouldn't be about the money, the profile, the cd  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->packaging marketing and cool music videos. It is about  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the art, because at the end of it all, it is all we leave  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->behind. Honest art.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I thought immediately of type, specifically of type  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->design. What is the attraction of a largely thankless  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->task appreciated by few yet exposed to many? I think I  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->am hooked because it can be honest. Other people  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can use your type, and something very real and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->useable is 'left behind'. It is inherently narcissistic. It  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would be nice to know for everyone else: why? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am not sure of typography in its' present state. I have recently discovered a version of a Latin Alphabet in transition among stone cutting in Finland.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Jones<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was an anglo-welsh poet, painter, engraver, also known for his painted inscriptions. He fought in the First World War, about which he wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In Parentheses<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and was one of the many British converts to Catholicism in the 1920s. He spent time at a couple of Eric Gill's guild communes, and was for a time engaged to Gill's daughter Petra, but found the solitary life better suited to his temperment.

And maybe get a lucky break now and again. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In my case: I did #1 until it dried up, I have no patience for #2, and although I think I'm luckier than average my talent is certainly not huge.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, to be honest, I am an addict, when it comes to type. I could lock myself up in the mountains, with my computer and make type all the time. And to the tempo I want. But I don't&hellip;. (I have a kid and a partner). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would be a liar, if I said, I wouldn't want to make money with it. But I am realistic enough to know, that if I wanted to make bucket full of it, I'd have to change a lot. Not only in the way my type should look like, but also structural. I mean, at the end, wether you sell type or graphic, you'll need to find a way to get to your potential customer. You can sit and wait till everyone notices how supperb your designs are, but this might take a while. But you can also try to get anyones attention by any means like advertisement, lobby, connections, internet, whatever. (Having peoples attention doesn't mean your good in making faces, but it might mean you're good in getting attention, which is a gift) You'll need a lot of energy to do this as well. And time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because mostly, you won't make big money with type when you start, you probably will do something else for a living. So you will do your type thing during in those late nightly hours and weekends. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think, the biggest issue is time. To make a decent typeface, you need time. To make more, you more time. To sell it, too.. So it comes down to how you manage your time (and your working methods) and what your priorities are. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash;jacques</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm in this business for exactly one reason: I love type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, the question of how feasible it is, in general, to make a living at type design is a good one. I originally got into type wanting to be a full-time type designer. I contacted a couple of eminent folks to ask where one could go to learn about type. Both Chuck Bigelow and Robert Brunghurst were kind enough to carry on a bit of correspondence. Both of them suggested that there was little likelihood of making a living at type design. Now, I ignored that part of their advice, but I took it to heart as well, and it made me work that much harder. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I should add that today I agree with them. I know quite a few type designers, and except for the very biggest names, and some employed by the large type foundries, most don't make a living at type design. They teach, or do graphic design, or other stuff to make money, and do type design because they love it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm lucky enough to work for Adobe, and get to do fun type stuff and get paid quite well. Once in a very rare while I've even gotten to do some type design. But there are few jobs like this, and even fewer that involve actual type design, that like Bigelow and Bringhurst I find it hard to encourage people. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My actual advice is this: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Decide if you could be happy doing stuff other than original type design per se. If so, there are about 5x as many opportunities. I didn't go in with this intent, but it worked out pretty well for me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Make your own luck. This means three things: working hard as heck at your craft; going out of your way to pick up related specialized skills; spotting and exploring potential opportunities. This was a big part of how I ended up with a real paying job in type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Learn programming. Somebody with a BSc in computer science who is also heavily into type is probably more likely to find a decent-paying type job than somebody with an MFA in design. (At least, that's my perspective.) It will also give you skills that will be incredibly useful in type production. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, that's my two cents. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>
