body: "Hello, people! \r\nI'm currently designing a book that is, actually, the compilation
  of a conference about the quantum physics of consciousness, with some of the biggest
  thinkers on the subject. I got the cover illustration approved, already, it's something
  concerning the \"Schr\xF6dinger's cat experiment\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat\r\n\r\nTrying
  to follow my current type bible, Bringhurst's \"Elements...\" I have been really
  cracking my head to get a meaningful typography to match such an interesting subject.
  Nationality is an issue, though. The conference was held in Switzerland, with a
  German theoretical as chairman, and had participants from Austria, England, US,
  Chile, among others. But the book will be published in Germany by a German institute
  identified with the school of Ulm and stuff... \r\n\r\nSo, the situation is:\r\nI
  have this feline cover\r\nI have this very contemporary and international (but with
  a german \"output\" if you allow me) text, with lots of people talking, the speech
  goes from one participant to the other, like in a play, I have to keep clear who
  is speaking at the time.\r\n\r\nFirst of all I considered Otl Aicher's rotis. Besides
  the author biography I think the semi serif really has a feline feel. I thought
  of doing the whole book taking advantage of the many versions of rotis. But when
  I started to layout the inside text body the rotis serif didn't really behave as
  I expected. Besides, the version I have do not include text numbers and de fi and
  fl ligatures cannot be right.\r\n\r\nThen I changed my mind and thought of Glypha
  and Univers. But recently I decided not to be so hard on the obligation of a german
  design for the text body. My dynamic duo is, currently, Avenir and Chaparral. Avenir
  is looking good in the cover and they look good together in a test inside page I
  did, with side notes. What do you guys think? \r\nThank you for commenting or just
  reading this troubled mind!\r\nMarco\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I've done one book--a dissertation in anthropology--using Chaparral, and
    find it a very useful, readable face (though the r is a little odd). Some might
    find it too colorful for a natural-scientific text, I guess. The size variants
    (\"opticals\"), which I didn't have, would make it even more useful for academic
    texts, with notes etc.\r\n\r\nI really have no well-founded opinion on Avenir.
    Does it have text numerals?\r\n\r\nRotis is not one of my favorites, though the
    serif version is bearable."

    Yeah, that's a problem, I don't think I have any geometric with text numerals..."

    text is Trump Mediaeval (Trump was German!), but this may be just because at university,
    my textbook in neuroscience was set in that face.

  body: 'Perhaps you could have the viewer interact with the cover? (Two possibilties
    that jumped to my mind: 1. lenticular printing; 2. a binding / wrap that requires
    the purchaser to tear the book open in a way such that some cat lives or dies.)
    Perhaps have a jacket that interacts with the cover itself? (Through transparency
    or cut-outs; a pair of moire images could allow small motions to induce all sorts
    of effects.)'

  body: "Another form of interaction would be back cover/front cover, like the t-shirt
    that says \"the cat is dead\" and \"the cat is alive\" on front and back. \r\nI
    know interaction is supposed to supercede mere depiction of an idea, but if you're
    familiar with the concept in a classical way, interaction is a trite hassle. It's
    like having to mouseover a CS logo in the OS X dock and they all look the same
    even after what is it, three years?! when having it spelled out would work better.
    So the illustration of superimposed cats works very nicely.\r\n\r\nWhen I say
    that true randomization is impossible, I mean that the OpenType feature is not
    supported by any typesetting applications.\r\n\r\nReading is a quantum phenomenon.
    You decide what text means by reading it. That's why Helvetica is so stupid --
    all that entaglement with billions of other texts clouds the meaning of any particular
    text it's used for.\r\n"

  body: "Dear Nick,\r\n\r\nI think you are having a Milli Vanilli moment. This idea
    has already been done by Tal Lemming in Christian Schwartz's LOCAL GOTHIC. You
    have seen this before. I hope your failure to provide attribution is simply an
    oversight.\r\n\r\nLemming told me over lunch that most of the information on his
    website is simplistic smoke and mirrors but the basic ideas are deeply rooted
    in a quantum physics. You see, the problem with producing a \"random\" effect
    in OpenType is that the GSUB table is static. There is no way to, as Just van
    Rossum and Erik van Blokland did in BEOWOLF, link to a pseudo-random number generation
    library. This prevents the generation of a random seed which in turn causes the
    utter failure to launch a randomization routine. Most of the attempts at randomization,
    and I believe that Phiney's attempts fall into this category, use simple glyph
    rotation schemes or very simple backtracking to trigger a single substitution.
    What Lemming stumbled onto was a way to simulate a random seed generator. From
    there it was a fairly simple set of steps for him to implement a basic superposition
    algorithm. I shouldn't give away any more secrets as he explained all of this
    in confidence.\r\n\r\nWill you be in Lisbon? We should have a beer together.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    do you know Professor Andreas Von Shinn of the Hochsch\xFCle of Fachhochschule
    Darmstadt?\r\n\r\nSIncerely,\r\nRandolph T. Burke"

    don't believe I claimed to have invented the idea of random variation from a set
    of alternates. (Making it work in a digital font is another matter.)\r\nThe first
    time I came across it was Kozmik the Flipper font, over ten years ago.\r\nI have
    no idea how truly random Tal's \"random seed generator\" is, but it sounds way
    kewl.\r\nJohn Butler has done something for the OT version of LettError's Kozmik.\r\nI
    didn't mention either (and there are probably more) -- I didn't think it was an
    issue.\r\nIn fact, I published a typeface, Handsome Pro, in 2004 that has many
    contextual alternates, triggered by a variety of cues, that gives a good random
    effect -- there are quite a few script fonts that do this.\r\nThe only ostensibly
    random OT technique I have looked at is Mr Phinney's.\r\nSorry, not going to Lisbon.
    But a beer is always a good idea.\r\n"

    the tone of Chaparral. Also, I think that a rounded face has a good contrast with
    a slab -- it's difficult to choose a contrast face for a slab, as the monoline
    quality is close to sans."
