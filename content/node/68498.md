  anybody help me. I generated Tahriri Nastaliq font and copy on font windows folder
  so it's work properly on MS word without any problem but any time run cs4 Adobe
  program like Indesign or Photoshop immediately they are not running or quite from
  program. Then delete font from folder font and running cs4 program again, they are
  run without any problem. Now I confuse and I don't know what happen. I need use
  this font also on cs4 adobe program especially Indesign cs4 (because it support
  cursive positioning). I appreciated for attention my problem and I'm waiting for
  reply.\r\n"

    Validator</a> tool from Microsoft. [This tool needs to be updated and may report
    as errors a couple of things that are in fact okay, but it is still a very useful
    tool.]"
