  \r\n\r\nAnyways if anyone can Identify the typeface (or similar) used for the iconic
  film poster it woudld be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nhttp://ygrael.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/deep_throat_poster_01.jpg\r\n\r\nit
  looks like a more modern version was used for the documentary:\r\nhttp://www.celebritywonder.com/mp/2005_Inside_Deep_Throat/movieposter.jpg"

  body: "Yes it is, and the D is less wide, but the version used in the poster is
    pre-digital, and those came often with alternate character shapes and widths for
    optimum headline composition. When Blippo originally was digitised only the basic
    character set was included.\r\n\r\nWhich is a shame, because there are a large
    number of popular display faces from the phototype era that had lots of interesting
    alternative shapes in their character sets, and those are lost until somebody
    has the brilliant idea to include them in a digital version. One of the classic
    examples is ITC Serif Gothic."

  body: Oh, and "fixing" that P and D shouldn't be too hard. For parody purposes.
