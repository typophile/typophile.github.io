body: "hey everybody, i saw the post about gay type earlier and one of the posters
  mentioned judy garland, who is also a favorite of mine as well. can anybody tell
  me what this font is that they used on her classic poster from the show at CARNEGIE
  HALL?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Judy at Carnegie.jpg]\r\n\r\ni
  hope i figured out how to post the image right. \r\n\r\ni found a few fonts that
  are pretty close, but nothing that has the right spirit! i think \"IN PERSON\" might
  be rounded, but sorry it's hard to tell from the image. thanks everybody, this is
  my first time wth a request like this and it's great to see how helpful you are
  to amateurs like me!!!"

    bleeding ink of something like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.45.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=IN+PERSON&sampleSize=48\">Futura

    Futura, but I want to believe its Omnes. I so love that face. Has anyone seen
    Corundum Text? Its great. Love to see someone mix the two of them"

  body: "thanks so much guys! except for dezcom, what does football have to do with
    this? i had to google the \"packers\" to see what you were talking about? only
    americans would wear so much padding to play rugby and i have no idea why you
    think football is a good name for it.\r\n\r\nanyway i will get that titling gothic
    right away, it's not perfect but it's really really close and i think i may use
    omnes too just beacuse i like it. i'm copying this poster to make invitations
    for my best friend's 40th birthday party because he's a huge fan, but i don't
    think he'll notice if the type isn't a perfect match. thanks judy g! i see you're
    an even bigger fan than my best friend!"
