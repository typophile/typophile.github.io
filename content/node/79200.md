body: "People keep asking me to translate my essays and talks about legibility into
  English. The translations and definitions of legibility and readability are fairly
  easy, but I use some addition terms in German, which I am not so sure about. \r\n\r\nThis
  is my theoretic legibility model:\r\n<img src=\"http://www.typografie.info/2/attachment.php?attachmentid=1869&d=1295461403&stc=1\">\r\nLegibility
  is defined by properties of the layout (->typography) and by properties of the used
  typeface. And here I use three German terms which I need to translate:\r\n\r\nGerman:
  <em>Erkennbarkeit</em>\r\nDirect translation: <strong>recognizability</strong> -
  the characteristic of a letter to be perceived as such. Recognizability is probably
  okay, isn't it?\r\n\r\nGerman: <em>Unterscheidbarkeit</em>\r\nDirect translation:
  <strong>distinguishability</strong> - The characteristic of a letter to be easily
  told apart from other letters. For example one-storey a vs. two-storey a. \r\n\u201CDistinguishability\u201D
  seems to be used rarely. Is it okay or is there a better word for that?\r\n\r\nGerman:
  <em>Lesefreundlichkeit</em>\r\nDirect translation: <strong>reader-friendliness</strong>
  \r\nThis is probably the most tricky one. It describes the characteristic of a typeface
  to be readable in continuous texts without causing the reader to get tired or distracted.
  One typeface might be perfectly legible (in terms of recognizability/distinguishability)
  for a single shopping mall sign but it might still not be suited for a 400-page
  novel. \r\nIs there a good term to describe this feature of a typeface? Or does
  the \u201Creader-friendliness of a typeface\u201D make any sense to a native English
  speaker?\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n"

    I feel like  <em>recognizable</em> is something we hear often, but for some reason,
    to me,  <em>recognizability</em> \"klingt falsch.\" \r\n\r\nIn regards to  <em>distinguishability</em>
    and <em>reader-friendliness,</em> both sound find to me;  I doubt either would
    cause any trouble for comprehension, both sound natural. \r\n\r\nAlthough, I've
    usually  encountered the quality of <em>reader-friendliness</em> described as
    <em>readability</em>, in conjunction with (as you've already stated) <em>legibility</em>.
    I think the difference between the two is understood (at least among typophiles)."

  body: "Ralf, here is a pretty careful definition: \"'Legibility' is based on the
    ease with which one letter can be told from the other. 'Readability' is the ease
    with which the eye can absorb the message and move along the line.\"--from Types
    of Typefaces, by J. Ben Lieberman, 1967.\r\n\r\nThese meanings are somewhat established.
    For example, Tracy uses them the same way in his Letters of Credit. I think the
    terminology was developed in the '40s, by a scientist hired by Linotype, but I
    haven't nailed it down yet. \r\n\r\nBasically, I think your \"reader friendliness\"
    is just \"readability\" in English. I'm not sure whether there is a need for a
    separation between \"recognizability\" and \"distinguishability,\" as so long
    as you know it's supposed to be a letter, it amounts to the same thing. The time
    factor is important, which is covered by Lieberman's \"ease\" terminology.   \r\n\r\nSo
    I don't see the need introduce a third term beyond the readable/legible distinction.
    Note that legibility refers to letters and readability to words. It might be useful
    to distinguish readability in individual words\u2014such as on signage\u2014and
    readability in extended text. Ultimately, the viability of such distinctions will

  body: A good attempt, Craig, but I am not convinced. Distinguishability and recognisability
    seem to me so closely linked in reading that I can't see grounds to separate them
    at the reading model level. Yes, they can be conceptually differentiated, as you
    demonstrate, but distinguishability is relative recognisability, and since, outside
    of glyph legibility testing, we are always seeking to recognise signs in context
    of other signs, relative recognisability is the normal circumstance of legibility.
    In your illustration, the numeral eight provides the context that enables you
    to differentiate distinguishability from recognisability in the two sixes. But
    what if you add an old Welsh letter V (U+1EFC) in the style of Ambicase Modern
    to the illustration? Suddenly both sixes have comparable distinguishability problems.

    on one hand, or rhetoric, on the other.\r\n\r\nI don't think it should be presumed
    that time and comfort are equivalent. I don't think they are. I think you can
    push yourself to read something quickly, even when it is more taxing. The comfort
    shows itself over time as fatigue sets in and comprehension will go down. My proposal
    has been to use SAT reading tests, over long enough an interval for fatigue and
    diminished reading comprehension to set in. Then comparing different fonts and

  body: "Ralf, my project has been to try to find functional-ontological grounding
    for type-critical terms within the cognitive-scientific and perceptual-psychological
    domains. \r\n\r\nA consequence of this might be to relate both <em>Erkennbarkeit</em>
    [recognizability] and <em>Unterscheidbarkeit</em> [distinguishability] to categorical
    perception. Categorical perception is the psychological tendency to accommodate
    an specific instance of a form to a base-level category we are familiar with,
    like for instance the letter a, even though the specific instance has it's own
    individuality. \r\n\r\nUsing this strategy it becomes apparent that recognizability
    relates to within-category membership and distinguishability to between-category
    differences. Discernability of within-category membership and the magnitude or
    gradient of between-category differences go hand-in-hand.\r\n\r\nOn the within-category
    membership front we are confronted with issues of role-architectural conventionality
    or prototypicality and role-architectural norm-violations. On the between-category

    How would you explain it in different words?\r\n\r\nOf course the eyes move (or
    better jump) along the line. But why is that stressed here in the definition of
    readability? The legibility of letters is also directly connected to the way the
    eyes move along a line.\r\nWhat does \u201Cabsorb the message\u201D mean? Does
    it mean \u201Cto understand the given information\u201D? This would be pretty
    much my definition too. But \u201Cabsorbing\u201D sounds very different than \u201Cunderstanding\u201D.
    The first sounds rather passive to me, the latter is a rather active process (like
    interpreting, guessing, ...). Absorbing sounds like \u201Cpicking up\u201C which
    I find is more connected to legibility. Compare the Latin origin of legibility:
    \u201Clegere\u201D (gather/collect/pick out)."

    assume that this is \u2018worse\u2019 is begging the question, because quite a
    lot of the cognitive psychology literature on reading uses the term legibility
    for most of the stuff you are talking about, and doesn't talk about readability
    at all, except sometimes in reference to higher level document criteria including
    prose style, vocabulary, document layout (macrotypography). A letter-wise word
    recognition model, as now accepted on the basis of experimentation -- rightly
    or wrongly -- by most psychologists studying reading, favours this simple conflation
    of concepts that you are keen to differentiate, because they must consider legibility
    of the letter unit as the whole key to word recognition. And until someone produces
    an experimental result that <em>cannot</em> be explained in the context of the
    letter-wise word recognition model, I think most psychologists are going to take
    Occam's razor to concepts of readability distinct from legibility.\r\n\r\n[I'm
    anticipating someone pointing to the \u2018word superiority effect\u2019 as such
    an experimental result, so remind you that this is precisely a phenomenon observed
    in <em>letter</em> recognition tests.]\r\n\r\n<em>I certainly agree that the used
    layout (or onion structure) is not something that is really inherent to these
    terms. It just developed in this way while I was working on it.</em>\r\n\r\nWhich
    is what I reckoned. But diagrammatic structures suggest relationships, and an
    onion structure suggests encompassed layers. And when you explicitly call something
    \u2018the onion layer model of legibility\u2019 you are strongly suggesting that
    there is something meaningful and applicable about this relationship of layers.
    But there is nothing in your explanation that suggests to me an onion layer relationship
    of the phenomena you are describing and labelling. Is recognisability something
    that is somehow <em>within</em> legibility and itself, in turn, encompassing distinguishability?
    Your accompanying text doesn't suggest such a relationship: you just happen to
    have drawn it this way. I suggested sandwich or cake models as alternatives, since
    what you have represented as encompassing layers could just as easily and equally
    validly be represented as stacked layers. Or, indeed, one can imagine the cookie
    model in which each of the distinguished and labelled phenomena are quite distinct
    objects sitting together on a plate and not layers at all. And your conclusion
    remains the same: sometimes you only need to eat two cookies, sometimes you need
    to eat the whole plateful.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my final observation that,
    in your illustrative conclusion you have not shown any typographic circumstance
    in which legibility alone is a requirement. Your headline example involved both
    legibility and recognisability. So why are you insisting on these two being separate
    phenomena? Doesn't your model work equally well if legibility and recognisability
    are assumed to be the same thing? Then, as I wrote in February, while recognisability
    and distinguishability can be <em>conceptually</em> differentiated, in practice
    distinguishability is relative recognisability since, outside of glyph legibility

    your basis for saying this? From conversations with Bill, I'm convinced he has
    found the source for the introduction of the term readability into typographic
    discourse. I'm not going to spill the beans, but I'm not sure your claim about
    why readability was coined is well-founded.\r\n\r\nKevin, I think the <em>decoding</em>
    / <em>comprehension</em> schematization has some merit. It might be useful to
    note that in the Hoover and Gough formula you play off of the R is <em>reading
    comprehension</em>, the D is <em>decoding</em> and the C is an L, for <em>linguistic
    comprehension</em>.\r\n\r\nIn my own \u2018functional ontology\u2019 of reading
    I use <em>sense-following</em> and <em>rapid automatic visual word-form resolution</em>
    to describe the two foundational components of reading. Sense following presupposes
    the capacity for linguistic comprehension, and rapid automatic visual word-form
    resolution might be considered a dimension of decoding specific to continuous
    reading of extended texts.\r\n\r\nHoover and Gough call their scheme The Simple
    View of Reading, but they don't mean to deny that each of these components and
    the way they interact is complex.\r\n\r\nSkilled decoding for Hoover and Gough
    is \u201Cefficient word recognition: the ability to rapidly derive a representation
    from printed input that allows access to the appropriate entry in the mental lexicon,
    and thus the retrieval of semantic information at the word level.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDeriv[ing]
    a representation from printed imput\u201D is another way of capturing what my
    <em>rapid automatic visual word-form resolution</em> specifies. The parallel letter
    recognition scheme is a theory of what this entails. But even parallel recognition
    schemes are forced to accept that performance at affordance plateaus or peaks
    is different than performance at affordance thresholds. A Sheedy study Kevin was
    involved with demonstrates a letter-superiority effect at thresholds of affordance.
    Meanwhile it is well-known that at plateaus of affordance a word-superiority effect
    emerges. And we have reason to believe that what Ralf calls <em>unterscheibarkiet</em>
    plays differently at these thresholds than at peaks. These differences at thresholds
    and at plateaus alone could motivate a distinction between legibility and readability.\r\n\r\nRather
    than brush everything that relates to decoding under one terminological carpet,
    typographers and type designers might be better served by exploring the decoding
    domain in richer ways than til now has been done, and hang their terminological
    hats on what will emerge from this rather than leaving the terms floating in the
    air."

    is a very fuzzy little munchkin which is sure to bring debate at the mention of
    it. We perhaps can agree that sighted humans can observe certain forms and agree
    that they are indeed signs which can be configured as words and sentences. Science
    has measured the physical motions of human observers in this process. We \"know\"
    the eye moves in saccades instead of a smooth line. We know that regressions have
    been observed and the number and frequency of regressions is a variable from person
    to person and text sample to text sample. We know that the amount of time a given
    individual will continue to read text can vary with conditions as well as with
    individuals.\r\n\r\nWe know also that after reading a given text, it is possible
    for the reader to achieve some level of comprehension of what the author intended.
    We know there is great variation possible in comprehension depending on what the
    variables are and the individual. I am glad that some scientists are attempting
    to define, within reasonable tolerances, which variables can be controlled enough
    to measure and how to go about this. Out of this research may come something of
    value in the arena of glyph form and presentation of material to reader.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    we live and read in a world where we are limited in what we control and who the
    readers and writers may react. As typographers and type designers, we \"know\"
    within some fuzzy tolerances when something is \"Readable Enough\" to serve its
    purpose.  We certainly do not agree on the exact point or even what is inhibiting
    enough to matter. We probably don't but probably should agree that there are cases
    when factors that impede decoding of presented signs can also be more valuable
    in the communication of the intended or even unintended message.  This can be
    recognizing a loved-ones poor handwriting and carefully taking the time to thoroughly
    read and understand it compared to instantly trashing a perfectly composed and
    typeset page of text with optimum line length font, and leading because we \"know\"
    we are not interested in what it has to say.\r\n\r\nThere are times when a reader
    is \"interested enough\" to continue reading even if the presentation is not perfect.
    \ If a person has purchased a book, it stands to reason that they are interested
    enough to read it. When tax forms come to be read,we may dread the idea of doing
    so but eventually complete the dreary task anyway. If a person takes a newspaper,
    he may read only what interests him and ignore the rest. Enter the world of advertising
    and persuasive communication:\r\n\r\nWhat happens when, as an author, you wish
    to have your message attended to by people who have no interest in it? It can
    be as perfectly set as the Lord Bringhurst can manage but remain unattended to.
    \ It can also be presented in such a way as to entice a fair number of people
    to give it a look. This is what much of the communication industry is tasked to
    do. The unwilling reader is targeted, not those who are already onboard. The type
    shops of the world are loaded today with thousands of fonts that will never read
    as well as a Garamond or a Caslon but may just be the right tool to get a second
    look from the uninterested reader. Sure, we still need fine book faces and clear
    signage faces and readable tax forms, but there is a point where we \"know enough\"
    to know what will read well enough to do the job at hand.\r\n\r\nEven fine books
    are subject to the effects of production costs and therefore are more likely to
    take a chance on a reduction in type size that will reduce the expense and put
    the book at the desired pricepoint to succeed.\r\n\r\nAs a type designer, I have
    much more interest in a typeface reading well enough for the job it was intended
    as well as being attended to in the first place, than I have in endless debates
    on reading terminology which will never achieve a thing usable in my life time.

    assumption of the parallel distributed processing scheme: the assumption that
    neural representation of higher order structures like letters or words is in terms
    of weighted connections between lower level representational primitives such as
    distinctive features. So there are problems with internal coherence.\r\n\r\nKohanen
    networks, if I understand them correctly, rely on only a single layer of nodes.\r\n\r\nBut
    this is getting far away from Ralf\u2019s concerns.\r\n\r\nI tried in my previous
    post to address this by suggesting that even on Hoover and Gough\u2019s framework
    the decoding part is complex enough to warrant a parsing into sub-components or
    multiple factors distinct enough to be aligned with separate affordance terms,
    such as Ralf proposes. Kevin seems to prefer a simple alignment of legibility
    with decoding and readability with linguistic comprehension."

    \r\n\r\nI get a sense from my initial look at this literature that something is
    amiss in the relationship of computer modeling to brain science and to the testing
    of human subjects. And I see other methodological problems in research psychology
    as well. I think that all the modeling work is impressive and will eventually
    be put to good use, but that skepticism about methodology is merited and healthy.
    \ \r\n\r\nAs to my not knowing the literature, that is quite right, which is why
    I am asking about it. Can you point me to novel predictions about reading that
    have come out of modeling? "

    to stress this differentiation between recognition/decoding and comprehension/understanding
    which I consider useful to be linked to legibility and readability. I am aware
    that especially within the typographic community this is often handled differently
    (as this thread proves) but I don't think these vague and contradictory definitions
    are helpful in any way. I think \"to be legible\" and \"to be readable\" can each
    mean one thing\u2014within any context. \u201Cmove along a line\u201C or \u201Cpleasure
    or friendliness of reading\u201C don't work in this regard.\r\nBut of course,

  body: "Ralf, you say \u201C[l]egibility is defined by properties of the layout (->typography)
    and by properties of the used typeface.\u201D Clearly the letters in a typeface
    can be robustly recognizable and optimally differentiated from each other (properties
    of the used typeface). I think it can be shown that these factors greatly effect
    performance at affordance thresholds, that is, where the distance or size thresholds
    is for a particular typeface, beyond which accurate and immediate perceptual discrimination
    is no longer stable. Typically we associate these kind of considerations with
    legibility.\r\n\r\n\u201C[P]roperties of the layout\u201D are a factor in this,
    but only if the leading or interletter or between-word spacing is way too tight.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to me that at affordance peaks, where speed of reading levels off, cortical
    integration issues relating to phase alignment, cue value co-ordination and other
    \u201Cproperties of the layout\u201D such as line length, leading enter the picture
    differently. I would suggest these issues are distinct enough from the at threshold
    issues that they deserve a separate name.\r\n\r\nAt affordance peaks, as measured
    by reading rate, there typically exists a wide plateau. To my mind readability
    is about how performance is modulated on this plateau by manipulation of type-form
    micro-variables, and typo-setting parameters.\r\n\r\nI think it is counterproductive
    to sweep these dissociable things under one carpet."

    to perceptual-psychophysical components of perceptual processing in reading (decoding)
    it will help us become more disciplined.

    you write about I do think exists, especially concerning claims that this face

    about what sounds might be confused in listening. But I haven't got into it much
    yet. And you may be right that I was too hard on them, as brain science has only
    been taking off recently, past the time when a lot of this modeling work was done.
    I still think there's a problem, but now I'm guessing that it is more a matter
    of following the Selz model of discrete elements that are slotted into a logical
    structure. I do think we do that kind of thinking, but it's only one kind. And
    I suspect, like you, that what's going on in the visual part of reading words
    is much more pattern recognition rather the up and down reflection that is involved
    in interactive activation. My guess is that we recognize a hat and the word \"hat\"
    by processes that have a lot of similarity. \r\n\r\n>I first need to pimp my English.\r\n\r\nDon't

    decoding involves feature detection and feature integration: does it makes sense
    to identify two measures, one having to do with the former and one with the later.\r\n\r\nUnder
    conditions were detection becomes a problem, such as with type that is too small,
    or conditions that are unfavourable, such as inadequate lighting or poor visibility
    or too great a distance, some types perform better than others. Performance at
    such affordance thresholds gives us a value we can call legibility.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, inconsistent spacing at normal text sizes can disrupt efficient
    feature integration. It can force the visual cortex to process the features of
    letters independently and in separate chunks, rather than altogether as a coordinated
    group. Or it can force the visual cortex to work too hard to process the feature
    set as a coordinated group (The debate about neural network models that Bill alludes
    to is a debate about which one of the options provides a better explanation of
    what occurs.) I'm suggesting that type-related factors that affect efficient feature
    integration might profitably be considered readability factors.\r\n\r\nUnder this
    scheme, the legibility coefficients of the letters can be just fine, but the readability
    of the text as it is laid out can be less than optimal.\r\n\r\nDoes this help?"

    Indeed Simon's observations got spoiled when he tried to account for mind by way
    of computer metaphor. Simon's flaws are not Selz's flaws. Also remember that Selz's
    first and foremost criticised association psychology, seeking a better way to
    account for <em>directedness</em> of thinking.*\r\n\r\n* Calling it a \"limitation
    to logical structure of fixed elements\" is the opposite of what his work was
    about: his focus was, almost a leitmotif back then, on 'function' (thinking) not
    'substance' (thoughts and their properties). The description reminds me that Gestalt
    psychologists dubbed it a \"machine theory\" and that they did so for a rather
    unscientific reason: what they found so offending was that Selz removed idealistic
    and vague notions of \"<em>content</em> [Gehalt] of value, of a work [Werk], of
    a problem\", of the \"<em>inner</em> of nature\" and of the \"<em>meaningful</em>\"
