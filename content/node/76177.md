  body: "My opinion would not count for much, not being able to read or speak Hebrew.\r\n\r\nEven
    so, with one look at the specimen, I could see some basic facts about the design.\r\n\r\nIt
    is attractive in appearance.\r\n\r\nIt has a touch of a \"monumental\" feel to
    it; that is, the shapes of the letters are such that one could imagine them being
    carved into rock.\r\n\r\nThere do not appear to be any legibility issues with
    the face, although it doesn't look like a design in which other considerations
    have been subordinated to efficiency in reading."

  body: In that case, clearly the designer of Hadassa Elegant <em>did</em> succeed
    in preserving that aspect of the atmosphere of Hadassa. Although I wouldn't have
    guessed that of the versions of the original Hadassa that I've seen, so I cannot
    be all that perceptive; the heavier weight, and the outward sloping of the sides,
    presumably among other and subtler characteristics, had led me to that conclusion
    in respect of this new face.
