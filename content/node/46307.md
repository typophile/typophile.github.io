  body: I think this is hand lettered although it is difficult to tell at this size
    & it would be nice to know the age of the image. The two a's are quite different
    & although the t's look similar at this scale a larger size might show subtle
    differences. Also the wider spacing & slightly larger size on the left compared
    to the right makes me think if this is a digital font it has been very carefully
    tweaked by someone with a good knowledge of hand lettering.
