  was invited to participate. I&#39;d be curious to hear what you think of my piece,
  the visual interpretation of a poem entitled &#34;Outside the Slaughterhouse&#34;
  by Ted Genoways. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.bornmag.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.bornmag.com</A>

    Typophile site. I enjoyed the cuts of meat metaphor. <BR> <BR>However, it would
    be nice if when you moused over the individual lines of the poem, there was more
    time to absorb the words before they faded away. <BR> <BR>-tim '

  body: ' I think your &#34;clinical&#34; treatment gives extra <BR>sharpness to the
    poem. If the choppy delivery <BR>of the text &#40;where the reader is hastened
    and <BR>sometimes forced to backtrack - like the poor <BR>livestock itself&#41;
    is intentional, then that&#39;s <BR>great. One idea: a subtle sound track &#40;maybe
    <BR>something like at snarg.net, or JMJ&#39;s Zoolook&#41; <BR>would add to it,
    as long as it&#39;s in a very <BR>muffled, low-frequency range. <BR> <BR>hhp '
