  body: This is piece of italic calligraphy. Its a basic hand that is found in most
    beginners classes and this looks like it was written by someone with a little
    bit practice but still yet to understand pen angle and good letter structure.

  body: "I don't think it's calligraphy. The forms are too uniform; pixel perfect.
    I've overlaid some of the repeating characters and they're a perfect match:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vampires_4063.png]\r\n\r\nI
    don't know what it is, though. The ampersand is Palatino.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Could be a cut & paste job? The p and r are on a different slant, from each
    other and the rest of the letters. The i has a different serif to m & n which
    is different to the p. The terminal of the n is also singular. Could have been
    someone's calligraphy made into a font with scan font or something?
