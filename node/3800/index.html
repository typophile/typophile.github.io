		<div class="commentbody">Big news for a lot of anxious people. <BR> <BR>Is this legal? Anyway, if the publisher of the print version didn't think they could make money on a reprint, then they probably don't care. On the other hand, they could have gained some positive exposure by releasing the PDFs themselves, maybe even selling the book in PDF form - FontLab does that with their manuals. So a small lesson for MIS Press. <BR> <BR>BTW, it's interesting that the text is text, not image. That might mean OCR was done, which would make it more work. Or maybe somebody provided the original digital files? One clue would be the body font: from what I remember Moye had modified Goudy's Italian Old-Style (giving the &quot;y&quot; a longer tail), and an OCR scheme wouldn't have that (unless the person had that special font)&hellip; And the PDFs seem to be using the non-Moye short tailed version. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ive been looking for something like this for a long time! <BR> <BR>Seems like this is the only reference book available for Fontographer. Why is this? Is anyone else supicious? Why are there so conspicously few typrographic software programs? And why is it that the main one (Fontographer) hasnt been updated for the best part of a decade and is no longer distibuted by Macromedia? Why is there only one(?) reference manual available for it and why has its publisher stoppped publishing it and mysteriously refuses to pass on the rights etc? Is there some kind of conspiracy going on? The truth must be out there&hellip;?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">No conspiracy that I can see, just that fonts are worth close to nothing these days. Why? Partly *because* of Fontographer (the so-called &quot;democratization&quot; of type design), but maybe also because their file-size is so small. Some people also blame a certain low perceived value among the public (the alphabet is free, blahblahblah), but I've started to think that such &quot;high-level&quot; cultural stuff is a side-effect, not a cause. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

Democratization is a threat to some, especially large corporations to whom it represents a general lack of control. You'd think there would be a lot of demand for a program like Fontographer, after all most of us still use it right? Enough demand for the continued developement of it at least? Why is large corporation not acting like large corporation and going where money is? Does Adobe have a font developer program? Not that I know of(?) Arent they one of the biggest names in digital typography AND software developement? hmm&hellip; <BR> <BR>(hope this doesnt sound like paranoia, its just something thats always bugged me)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is an entire saga surrounding Mr. Moyes book of which I believe the story goes something like this, anybody who has first hand information, please contribute . . . <BR> <BR>I believe all of the publishing rights to the book are still owned by MIS Press. Since the time of its publication MIS Press was absorbed by Hungry Minds and now Wiley Publishing and Wiley has no intention of selling them back or reprinting the book. <BR> <BR>This puts Mr. Moye in a bad situation since he doesn't legally own the content and cannot buy the rights to the book back. <BR> <BR>I had tried many times to contact Mr. Moye and he blacklisted me from his e-mail list apparently not interested in discussing the matter at all. <BR> <BR>I would genuinely like to see a follow up to this book and even a re-release since the information the book contains is as useful now as it was when it was originally published. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D</div>

One or two people to do the layout, ten or more people sending in tips/tricks/methods and screenshots, one or two people to edit, and follow an outline agreed upon by those in the know. It could be PDF-only, and might be a good refresher course even for the die-hards.</div>

A little here and a little there may add up faster than you'd think. <BR> <BR>It seems like there could be two distinct efforts: one to tackle the technical, application-specific workflow, and the other to address the design issues, like making properly proportioned small caps, kerning sensibly, etc. Personally, I would be more interested in the former, as the latter is often very subjective, so forums like this perhaps better serve that realm.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A couple of points: <BR> <BR>Copyright law varies from country to country, and in many jurisdictions, notably in most of Europe, it is considered fair use to make a copy of a work for your own personal use. This means that it would be legal in some jurisdictions for you to go to a library and photocopy the entirety of <i>Fontographer: type by design</i>. <BR> <BR>However, I'm not aware of any jurisdiction in which it is legal to <i>publish</i>, i.e. to make public, a work without obtaining rights from the copyright holder. Making a PDF version of a book available on the Internet for other people to view and download is not the same thing as making a copy of the book for your own personal use: it is publishing. The fact that a book is out of print does not mean that it is out of copyright, and it is neither legal nor ethical to <i>publish</i> someone else's work without permission. <BR> <BR>Yes, Moye's book is out of print, but that doesn't mean it is not available. Copies show up in second hand bookshops, on Ebay, etc.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Additionally, I should point out that it's my understanding that Stephen Moye is working on a new version of the book. <BR> <BR>Is everyone here who is pirating it promising they will either destroy all copies or rush out and buy a copy of the new one as soon as it comes out? You'd have to do that even if it's just a reprint of the existing one, of course, to make your current actions even vaguely ethical (they'd still be illegal, of course). <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, I promise to buy the book the first time I see it in a store. In fact I looked for this book extensively about 18 months ago to no avail! <BR> <BR>I think you have to be realistic about these things, yes it's illegal but I'm not denying Moye or his publisher profits as I'm not in a position to purchase their book in the first place. If you are correct in your knowledge that there will be a new book out in the future then I would be very pleased for the opportunity to own a copy. <BR> <BR>Regards from Aotearoa - land of the long white cloud <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">News of a possible new edition of <i>Fontographer: Type by Design</i> and how the rights to the book reverted to its author can be found here: <BR> <BR><a href="http://typographi.ca/000600.php#000600" target="_blank"><a href="http://typographi.ca/000600.php#000600">http://typographi.ca/000600.php#000600</a></a> <BR> <BR>Thomas, Dan, John: it wasn't my intention to promote book piracy. But I, too, searched for this book and ended up finding a copy in the library, and resorted to photocopying the first three chapters. As far as I know, the website where the PDF version is posted isn't charging any money for viewing the PDFs &ndash; how different from the library is that? And it's not even a good PDF, as parts of the book seem to have been scanned with OCR software, so that there are typos &ndash; and those sections don't use the same font as the book, so the text doesn't justify properly, etc. If the book was available somewhere, at a reasonable price (not the 200+ dollars they are asking for on some websites, which I can't afford!), I'd buy it in a second.</div>
