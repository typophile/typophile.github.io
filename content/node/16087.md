    with a different photograph of the inscription that is easier to read. I've tried
    to transcribe, but I don't recognise most of the words and some may be abbreviated.
    The first letter of the fifth line is confusing. I'm guessing it is sigma, simply
    because I can't imagine what else it would be (san = as), but everywhere else
    the lunate form has been used. It is difficult to be sure whether the first word
    in the second line ends with a double tau or a really wide pi. I'm guessing the
    latter, because double tau seems unlikely at the end of a word. \r\n\r\n\u03A0\u03A1\u039F\u03A3\u0397\u039D\u0399\u039A\u0395\u039D\r\n\u0391\u039A\u0395\u03A0

    refers to 'their love of God', unless \u0397\u03C6\u03B9\u03BB\u03BF\u03B8\u03B5\u03BF\u03C3
    it is a proper noun, e.g. the name of a deceased person. The last word is 'memorial'.\r\n"

    recall from my long-ago youth (when I still went to a Greek Orthodox church),
    this was \"Those in fellowship with God\" in our church, it was the brotherhood

    committee who did the fundraising and paid the bills (including building the church

  body: "The fifth letter of the third line must be a zeta -- the accusative form
    \u03A4\u03A1\u0391\u03A0\u0395\u0396\u0391\u039D wrapped around the lines.\r\n\r\nI
    think \u0391\u039A\u0395\u03A0\u03A4\u039F\u03A5\u03A3 must be a single word/name,
    the subject of the sentence, who is the (feminine) \u03C6\u03B9\u03BB\u03BF\u03B8\u03B5\u03BF\u03C2
    in question. I can't explain why the <cite>NYT</cite> gives a plural subject,
    since the nominative nouns (assuming \u0391\u039A\u0395\u03A0\u03A4\u039F\u03A5\u03A3
    is a name)  and the verb (which I can't make out, but is evidently a 3rd person
    singular form) are both singular. The verb looks like a relative of \u03C0\u03C1\u03BF\u03C3\u03C6\u1F73\u03C1\u03C9,
    in this context &#8221;to make an offering.&#8221;\r\n\r\nContra the Telegraph,
    the mosaic reads (unusually!) &#8220;[to] God Jesus Christ,&#8221; with the words
    abbreviated as <i>nomina sacra</i>."

    than an \"altar\" may be a significant clue to the dating of the site.\r\n\r\nI've
    been checking around to see what my colleagues make of the verb, and so far as
    I've been able to tell the consensus is that it must be an odd form of \u03C0\u03C1\u03BF\u03C3\u03C6\u1F73\u03C1\u03C9.
    <a href=\"http://www.novumtestamentum.com/2005/11/mosaic-inscription_09.php\">Brandon
    Mason</a> conjectures that the mosaic was broken and misrepaired; he also calls
    attention to the \u0397\u039D ligature in the first line.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.philipharland.com/Blog/2005/11/updates-regarding-christian-mosaic.html\">Phil
    Harland</a> provides wonderful amplification on the matter of <em>nomina sacra</em>
    in the penultimate line.\r\n\r\nAnd <cite>National Geographic</cite> provides
    <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/11/photogalleries/oldest_church/photo2.html\">a
    photo of the mosaic</a> <em>in situ</em>.\r\n\r\n(By the way, I find it incongruous
    that the bb software compels me to use the tag for \"emphasis\" when I want to
    use  true <em>italics</em> for a foreign language.)"
