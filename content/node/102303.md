  F. Schroeder. All I am able to stir up so far is very cursory.\r\nI figured if anyone
  could help me, it would be the great minds at Typophile.\r\nCan anyone here point
  me in a good direction to find useful information about Schroeder?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n-Chuck"

  body: There seems to be enough basic info (such as where he was living at some key
    points in time) to be able to use some of the available genealogy sources, including
    newspaper searches for related articles. Probably not much in Mill Valley, but
    as you know, there are/were quite a few papers in Saint Louis. There are also
    immigration records, naturalization data, census records, military records, and
    lots more. It depends on what kind of information you're looking for.  - Herb

    Hans Reichardt has made a pdf from most of them. See the link.\r\nhttp://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Schroeder/GustavFSchroeder.pdf\r\n\r\nOn
    the last page of the pdf also some references are listed you can probably find
    at a library like Columbia.\r\n-Joep Pohlen"
