  I have two version at the moment, a rounded one which quite look like a typewriter
  font and the typical slab serif approach. As always, crits & suggestions appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Q_Slab_3503.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Slab-1_6484.jpg]"

  body: The hook on the j is a bit too short and abrupt for my tastes, but that's
    what they are. Very good looking and solid overall. It strongly resembles Lubalin
    Graph, as any geometric slab-serif is likely to, but I think you noticed that
    too and included features to differentiate this. Am I right?

  body: "This is really neat. I prefer the roundy version.\r\nTo my eyes, the F, J
    and W are too wide, the y has too many serifs (compare to the g or u), and the
    serifs on the V need to be pulled in closer.\r\nHope that's helpful! :)\r\n"

  body: Maybe pull down the top end of the C, c, and G more, and/or shorten its serif?
