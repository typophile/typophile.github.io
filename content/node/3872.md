  body: ' On the subject, I was recently asked how many fonts are &#34;out there&#34;
    in the world. I had heard at one time there were 30,000 so I guessed 40,000. I
    also surmised that no single person could possibly keep track of every one. But
    if anyone would, it would be the font czar, Scoles. <BR> <BR>So does anyone know
    &#40;roughly&#41; how many fonts exist? &#42; <BR>How many new faces &#40;roughly&#41;
    are created each year? <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>&#42;digitally '
