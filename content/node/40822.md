  or InDesign, that uses Myruad Pro, some of the letters (I and l's) would always
  display rather awkwardly (though they'd print fine afterward). This is mainly noticeable
  when the type is outlined. I also found that some older versions of acrobat would
  display and print the I and l glyphs as dashed lines. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Myriard_3729.gif]"

  body: "There's nothing wrong with the font per se. I'm sure you'll observe the same
    \"issue\" when using a sans serif other than Myriad.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that
    the Reader (or whatever app you're using for viewing the PDF) takes advantage
    of the hinting data present in the font to improve the rasterization. When the
    glyphs are converted to outlines, that hinting data is no longer available, so
    the Reader defaults to a different rasterization mode that is good for general
    artwork, but not ideal for outlined text."

    interesting. Apparently the recent Adobe display algorithms treat a plain rectangle
    differently from other vector shapes and apply some special \"optimization\" on
    it. Not very useful with type. \r\n\r\nA."
