  body: Basit - welcome to typophile. Folkert posts here occasionally <BR>so maybe
    he&#39;ll see this thread. Or you could email him. <BR> <BR>For some reason, Motter
    Ombra comes to mind, but <BR>I&#39;ve never seen a digitization ...

  body: Hey Bj, <BR> <BR>I already emailed Folkert and he doesn&#39;t know what typeface
    it is. He was the one who pointed me to Typophile.  <BR> <BR>I posted this on
    myfonts.com and someone told me that this is Motter Ombra as well. I searched
    on Google but nothing came up.

  body: Basit -- what is the end goal ... to just find out, or to <BR>actually use
    the face for something. <BR> <BR>the reason I ask is because I could point you
    toward someone who  <BR>was supposedly working on a revival <BR>of ombra ...if
    this indeed is ombra. <BR> <BR>bj <BR>

  body: Bj, <BR> <BR>I would like to use this typeface actually. It would  be great
    if you could point me to the person who was working on the revival of the face.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve searched many typo sites but they dont have this particular font
    for sale.
