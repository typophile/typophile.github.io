  body: I just noticed today that Dan Solo recently released his own <BR>digitization
    of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/rubens/regular/testdrive.html?s=SHERLOCK+HOLMES&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Rubens</a>. It varies a bit from Richard&#39;s image, <BR>but
    is another font to add to the list.

  body: Well I&#39;m guessing Disney based their theme park signage on some version
    of Rubens. <a href="http://mickeyavenue.com/fonts/ravenscroft.shtml">Ravenscroft</a>
    was the attempt of a couple of Haunted Mansion fans to mimmick it. &#40;I was
    one of them.&#41; <BR> <BR>The <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/rubens/">Rubens</a>
    that Mike linked to appears to be by Jordan Davies rather than Dan Solo. Solo
    had a digitization of Rubens on the Dover Victorian Fonts CD &amp; Book, but I
    don&#39;t think he&#39;s yet revamped it for his MyFonts collection. Though, as
    bj noticed in the previous thread, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/excelsis/">Excelsis</a>
    is pretty close.
