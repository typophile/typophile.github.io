  body: BIzarre. The lowercase forms are seem related to the map lettering of the
    17-18th centuries, some of which were digitized by Tobias Frere-Jones in his Surveyor
    font for Martha Stewart. But the caps and the baselines are wacky.

    little bits, but nothing extensive.

  body: dunno. the digital version seems fairly faithful, but the baseline connectors
    have been flattened-out (noticeable on the 'c' and 'e' especially), which seems
    a little unfortunate. oh well.
