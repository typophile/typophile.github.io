  it took me about 3 months for correct optically the distortion of slanted and now
  I have serious doubts about the naming. Although it have changes in some glyphs
  (for example 'a' and 'f') is more an '[[oblique]]' version than an italic. \r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think about the naming? \r\nOblique have a 'negative' connotation in the
  customers?\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I need your help: \r\n<strong>Geogrotesque Italic</strong>

  body: "Well, the problem with \"Oblique\" is that in the styling group aka Windows
    family naming, you should only use terms \"Regular\", \"Italic\", \"Bold\", \"Bold
    Italic\". So in OpenType fonts, you won't get around the \"Italic\" term anyway.
    If it's called Italic in Word for Windows, I guess it is simpler if it would be
    also called on the other platforms. Similarly, I recommend not to defer from the
    other standard style names (\"Regular\", \"Bold\", \"Bold Italic\") for those
    styles, if possible. Of course for the more extensive families, other styles need
    to carry other names which then won't be compatible with the styling group names,
    but I think for the basic four fonts, it is best if the typographic names (i.e.
    OpenType family and style name) and the styling group names (i.e. Windows family
    and style name) are the same. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "em,\r\n\r\nin general, it is a question of how much we \"educate\" the users
    by adhering to traditional, typographic terminology (here, the term \"oblique\"
    _might_ be all-right, although your particular typeface is not obviously oblique,
    just as it is not obviously italic), vs. how much we make it easy for the users
    to just stick to what they commonly know. I guess for an average graphic designer,
    the difference between \"oblique\" and \"italic\" is not obvious, and in some
    languages it simply does not exist. For example in German or in Polish, the inclined
    counterpart to an upright typeface is simply called kursiv/kursywa, and most users
    have a 1:1 translation in mind (kursiv/kursywa = italic). \"Oblique\" may seem
    to them as an overcomplication. \r\n\r\nIn addition to that, the former argument
    I made about cross-application \"compatibility\" of menu names applies. This argument
    does not, however, mean, that we are bound to make 4-styles families. You can
    make larger typographic families, with appropriate naming that groups any number
    of styles under one family name, for Mac and OpenType-aware/Adobe applications,
    and on top of that, produce styling groups with up to 4 styles. An updated description
    of the process is available on <a href=\"http://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio-tips-and-tricks/font-family-naming-in-fontlab-studio-5-t313.0.html\">the
    FontLab forum</a>. But still, *within* those two naming systems, I think it is
    advantageous to use the same terms as much as possible, i.e. \"Bold\" should be
    \"Bold\" and \"Italic\" should be \"Italic\". In other words, I think it is best
    when the four \"basic\" styles of the large family have the same typographic and
    styling names (while for the other styles, the naming must differ, naturally).
    \r\n\r\nBut that's just my opinion. I think every designer or foundry needs to
    make that decision themselves. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"

  body: "I believe that for most font users, the English term \"italic\" just like
    the German term \"kursiv\" or Polish \"kursywa\" no longer describes a certain
    structural phenomenon, but rather a functional. I'd say that the most common definition
    given by an average user for \"italic\" would be that it's an inclined/slanted
    counterpart of the upright font in a font family. If you click on the \"I\" button
    in an application, it is labeled \"Italic\", no matter whether the actual font
    that it turns on is \"italic\" or \"cursive\" or \"oblique\". So Italic ends up
    being the most generic term. \r\n\r\nI myself would prefer if \"cursive\" and
    \"oblique\" became additional qualifiers that are used _in conjuction_ with the
    term \"Italic\". So one could have an \"oblique italic\" and a \"cursive italic\".
    Functionally, both are italics, but structurally, one is oblique and the other
    cursive. In other words, \"cursive\" and \"oblique\" are two extrema on one axis
    that is called italicness. That's how I see it. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Italic and Oblique refer to different things. The former is structurally
    different than the upright, the latter is structurally identical with the upright

    than italic, regardless of the one-storey 'a'). Italic Oblique does not make sense
    because Oblique is not Italic nor a subset of it.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Italic is
    better 'supported' so it is the preferred choice. Yet WPF does distinguish both,
    and on the level of WWS-compatible names would allow a family to have both Italic
    and Oblique style. Which however gets one into an odd situation when it comes
    to the four-style 'styling group' level. Obliques would need to become a separate
    family ... So for practical reasons, stick to Italic."

    functional definition, which is that oblique does not exist and italic is the
    inclined companion to an upright typeface. \r\n\r\nIn fact, both are somewhat

    it isn't. So by many users, it is treated as a \"roman\" face. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
