body: any font recommendation for use on printing a serial number on a product box?
  Need one that has clear differences between 0 and O, between B and 8, and between
  S and 5, and I and 1. It has been more difficult than anticipated, and it has to
  be clear enough for even the elderly. Thanks!

  body: Well, actually, one could be <em>really</em> rudimentary, and go with Courier,
    perhaps in a bold weight. Century Expanded is another popular choice.

  body: Courier did cross my mind, but the zero/cap O characters were a bit close,
    whereas Monaco has the stroke through the zero.
