  body: Pretty sure I have seen the first one before, but still drawing a blank. Would

    here, as is indicated on the forum select page. (General Discussions -- All topics
    are welcome\u2014except font ID requests.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't see the correct
    link in Reynir's post, so just in case, here it is the old-fashion way...\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/fontid"

  body: Three links on the page to the Font ID forum should be plenty by now, even
    for 100% flatscans.
