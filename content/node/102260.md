  I know is that it is similar to \"Dom Casual\" and to \"Polka\", but there are some
  differences and I'm sure its not any of those fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks in advence\r\n\r\n"

  body: looks very much like Dom to me. In fact the MANY iterations of it from different
    foundries each show changes. Not sure what differences make you unsure but the
    Bitstream, Linotype and Adobe versions have shorter strokes than the URW and EF
    ones.

  body: "thanks for your response\r\nI'm not sure if I'm able to explain that in english.\r\nFor
    example, the very top edge of the letter 'A' in the logo is horizontaly straight
    while in any Don fonts it is tilted. All edges in the logo are smoother and there
    are less details in them then in Don, it is easy to notice on a large text. I'm
    not a font expert and I don't know if its some kind of sub font or something like
    that. The reason why it bother me is that according to fonts.com i need to buy
    Don Casual to use it and I think the font in the logo was used for free."

  body: it's possible that your sample has had a stroke added, which would round off
    corners and obscure details. just a suggestion. i do see the tilt as well but
    honestly have no other suggestion for you. perhaps someone else will.
