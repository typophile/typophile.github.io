  body: "I was interested in this font, because it looks like a blend of styles, almost
    as if it was a hybrid of several designs. It comes from <a href=\"http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/\">The
    League of Moveable Type</a>, and they seem to have a noble sounding goal, but
    I have my reservations about their originality. For example, their Fanwood is
    a version of Rudolf Ruzicka's \"Fairfield\". Chunk, from which ChunkFive comes,
    seems to be blend of two or three existing slab styles, like mixing Giza with
    Rockwell.\r\n\r\nI am interested to examine their other fonts to see how much
    is 'borrowed' and how much is new work.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    in all the wrong places.\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks for the tip on WhatFontis.com. I've
    never heard of that site but I've already bookmarked it.\r\n\r\nI tried whatthefont.com
    and it came up empty.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
