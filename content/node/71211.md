body: "Kade is a display/semi display sans family of fonts based on vernacular lettering
  photographed over the last ten years in and around the harbours of Amsterdam and
  Rotterdam. Hence the name Kade that translates into English as \u2018quay\u2019,
  also the name of its designer.\r\n\r\nKade grew slowly from many different ideas
  and elements. The letters reflects the industrial method in which they are cut for
  the side of ships from large steel plates. Frequently subtleties of curves are compromised
  due to the cutting tools and the fact engineers are in control. Kade\u2019s italics
  have an experimental character and were produced in an unorthodox manner by rotating
  8 degrees, rather than slanting the roman characters; a method sometimes employed
  in shipyards. \r\nKade \u2018constructed character\u2019 is ideal for contemporary
  editorial works, architecture magazines, museums communication and posters.\r\n\r\nThe
  six distinct styles are published in OpenType format, featuring small caps and four
  sets of numbers (proportional old style, tabular old style, proportional lining
  and tabular lining), as well as matching currency symbols and a complete set of
  fractions.\r\n\r\nKade can be ordered at: http://www.re-type.com/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kade-newsletter4_6508.gif]"

  body: Interesting and nice! My only gripe would be that some counters (the B, for
    example) appear smoother than others.
