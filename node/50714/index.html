  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am designing a logo for my friends at the Health Blogs Observatory.
This is a non profit organization with the main goal to publish a web portal which would gather health/medical bloggers from all over the world and do some research.</p>
<p>I tried a lot of things and then I settle for three things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Health - cross</li>
<li>observatory - binoculars</li>
<li>web portal - computer, arcade type font</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this worth anything? Does anything show potential? 
I am not a professional designer, so I would really appreciate your advice.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I understand your thinking behind this. There are two problems for me. Firstly I think the red and white and the cross symbol represent first aid rather than a wide range of medicine and health. Also the &ldquo;computer, arcade type font&rdquo; is from a much earlier age of computers than blogging, and its fuzzy edges don&rsquo;t help. Look for something bolder, clearer and more up-to-date.
I would get rid of the cross but keep the binocular form. Try a warm, vibrant green or orange rather than red to look healthy and lively, and make it smaller if you are going to keep it to the side of the lettering.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In my opinion, you&rsquo;re approaching this design way too literally. The concept for the blog isn&rsquo;t visually congruent and to try and create a visual image to go along with the blog is honestly, out of your skill range. Not to offend.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d have better luck creating a clean logotype and matching it with health related images (stock photography perhaps) in the banner of the site.</p>
<p>Also, to reiterate what Jay said earlier, avoid the &ldquo;computer/arcade&rdquo; type. It&rsquo;s a poor concept to assume that if you&rsquo;re creating a logotype for a website it has to look &ldquo;techy or futuristic&rdquo;. Personally, I&rsquo;d use a friendly slab serif typeface like Soho, Archer, Zine Serif or Officina Serif. Any of these fonts would bring a confident look without seeming too cold or tiresome.</p>

<p>I will try the stuff you suggested, although the fonts you mentioned (I think all of them) are not accessible to me. Too expensive to buy for somebody who is not into this line of work.</p>
<p><strong>To whom do I turn to for designing such a logo and not pay a fortune?<strong>
This is a non profit organization, run by people who are volunteers and they need to spend a lot of money on all the technical stuff regarding their portal, so the money is short.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah I understand what you mean. I could try this, but I am not sure they will be very interested in this (maybe I am wrong). This portal would be on a global level not specific to Croatia.</p>
<p>I am using up your time, but since you have been so very helpful I would like to ask you one more thing. I was looking a little bit on the net about logo design and prices. The first sites that come up in Google are these firms that offer logo design for like 150-300 dollars. Most of them have pretty ugly websites and portfolios, but this one doesn&rsquo;t look bad &gt; <a href="http://www.logoworks.com/">http://www.logoworks.com/</a></p>
<p>Do you think this is worth it? Is there any better solution for this price range? 
Or is it just plain stupid to expect any quality for such small amount of money?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Honestly, I couldn&rsquo;t say one way or the other. I&rsquo;ve never used one of those sites. They might be great, they might not.</p>
<p>I will say, if you&rsquo;re expecting this website to be accepted globally, I would assume you have a pretty talented web designer. One that would design a site that&rsquo;s both easy to use, navigate, translate multi-culturally and still be appealing aesthetically. Why not have them create the logo for the site as well? If you don&rsquo;t have a web designer, then I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;ll need to revisit your priorities, because a logo comes much later in the process.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve heard stories of those &ldquo;cheap overnight logo&rdquo; type sites ripping off logos from other designers (in some cases, very well-known designers) but I&rsquo;m not sure if LogoWorks was one of them.

<p>How much is a logo worth for me? 10 000 dollars? Which I don&rsquo;t have.
There are other things to take in consideration apart from the clients opinion of how much something is worth. There is of course the designer, his work, how good he is. There is also the market, the competition, other designers. 
I am not stupid. I do realize that a job like this could cost from 100 to 100 000 dollars.
I saw this logo factories online offering work from 100 to 1000 dollars. This is what I liked about them, that they had some prices out there so I had some idea. OK they maybe bad, but still they are transparent.</p>
<p>That is why I asked you if it would be better to spend 300 dollars on these guys or if for this money I could find a better solution. Yes or NO, simple answer, no hard feelings.</p>
<p>These games with hiding prices and all the mystery remind me of the markets in Turkey and Tunis. Nobody has a prices on anything and they ask the same questions. So they sell you something for 10 dollars, then the same thing for 100 dollars to somebody else.</p>
<p>I would like to know the price, or at least some price range, so I can see what I can afford and also so I don&rsquo;t offend anybody by approaching and saying dude here is a 100 bucks.</p>
<p>For example Paul tell me how much would you ask to design a logo (only a logo) for the project I described.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A ballpark would START at around AU$2000 - that doesn&rsquo;t take into account relative factors for legitimate NFPs or NGOs.</p>
<p>And continuing about relativity&hellip; - i.e, how much value is placed on the project, it&rsquo;s an image and identity - a face - for the organisation.
Then you need to factor in things like; research (there always should be if the project is of any value to the business - the designer needs to get up to speed with the company, service/s, structure, audience &amp; visual language, and competition etc. to understand it.) then &hellip; project timing; specific requirements; approval processes; project management etc.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paying for the creative&rsquo;s/designer&rsquo;s time as a creative/visual thinker and designer - if you think that time is worth $100 you&rsquo;ll get a $100 result - because you will get A result. No doubt about it. Having said that, if you value a designers time at $100 &hellip; you won&rsquo;t have any choice but to be happy with whatever the results are. Clipart with a font might work &hellip; who knows.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll refer you to the triangle &hellip; you can have any two sides included in your project. Which two are most important to you?
<img src="/images/old-images/fast-good-cheap_5922.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paying for the creative&rsquo;s/designer&rsquo;s TIME of finding an effective and appropriate solution to your requirements and their EXPERIENCE in finding that effective and appropriate solution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be great if it were a fixed price industry &hellip; but it&rsquo;s not. There are too many variables involved.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, one thing never changes. You get what you pay for.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I believe the reason logo prices vary so dramatically is about process and measuring outcomes.</p>
<p>Some designers spend quite a bit of time doing visual research, sketching, research on the company, competitors, etc. to get a good idea of what the business is before trying to portray it visually. This is how major corporations do things.</p>
<p>Most often, a logo is not enough. You need business papers (letterhead, business card), and a style guide on how to implement the new look on other materials. Otherwise, you have a nice logo implemented badly, making the whole process moot.
So, its hard to just quote for a logo.</p>
<p>Other designers just draw whatever they think might work on the computer, and it takes an hour.
There are no restrictions to who calls themselves a designer, or what the process of designing a logo entails.</p>
<p>Another issue is very few designers try to measure the outcome of their success, so you can&rsquo;t tell if it is successful.</p>

<p>Also I do not believe that binoculars is the best representation of observatory. I think bird watching or peeping tom. An Observatory is a place where you go to observe or look. How do we look/see? With our eyes.</p>
<p>I believe that the cross/plus sign is a good representation of health.</p>
<p>As others have shared I think that your attention to the online nature of this company to dictate your typeface choice was incorrect. This company may start out as a blog, but evolve into an organization that may need printed collateral so the typeface should be universal, legible and still clearly state the name of the organization.</p>
<p>I would steer clear of the websites that offer cheap logo solutions. They often have a vast library where they just pull a medical related logo and type and then turn it back to you. Your friends company may end up with an identical logo for some other organization that they do not want to associated with.</p>
<p>Since your client is pro-bono and I am a student, I have thrown together something that you may use (as long as I am credited) or use as inspiration for yourself.</p>
<p>Before people scream speck work, Ivor has declared this to be a pro-bono project and I see no problem in helping him reach a successful solution.</p>

<p>Observatory to me is astronomy. Maybe there is a way to get the concept of &ldquo;Health&rdquo; in a simple (!) constellation. Or perhaps you use constellation / star chart in your supporting elements, and keep the logo typographic.</p>
<p>Logo Cost:</p>
<p>Consider two types of logo clients I&rsquo;ve encountered: one will love whatever I do and sign off on the first concept, others want 20 versions and then want to build a logo blending them all. If you are client one and agree to pay hourly, you might be in for a cheap(er) logo. The other, not so much. For a fixed-price estimate I will split the difference and include an hour maximum to save me from client #2. For a small/new business the numbers thrown around (2-5k) seems reasonable.</p>

Nicholas, wow thank you very interesting concept. Thank you very much for helping me. Thank you all. I am really touched that you are willing to unselfishly help me and this project. 
Randy, great idea to try something with constellation&hellip;hmmm</p>
<p>I was also playing around since first comments.
OK, I stuck to the idea of binoculars. Probably this is still not any good, but I believe it is an improvement from my first logo.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/logo_6252.png" alt=""></p>
<p>What do you think? I like the logo Nicholas suggested. Of course, without any doubt if we use it Nicholas would be fully credited and links to his web site would be included.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ivor, it seems unclear if the term <em>observatory</em> is related to Astronomy in this instance. It sounds like you are aggregating information from other Health Blogs in one central location. Yes?</p>
<p>If this has nothing to do with astronomy/stars, then the name seems like it will only confuse.</p>
<p>perhaps this project needs a better name before putting time into a logo?</p>
<p>Can you explain where the term <em>observatory</em> fits in?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No no no we are not aggregating information from other Health Blogs.
Sorry, maybe I was not clear enough.</p>
<p>This would basically be a research project. We want to observe and measure the health blogosphere and how it changes thru time. We plan to, at least, once a year conduct surveys among health bloggers and publish scientific reports. We also plan to include a wiki on the portal which will enable health bloggers to actively participate in the creation of survey questions. Kind of like a survey of health bloggers by helath bloggers. We would also follow news about health blogs and any research related to them and post them on our blog.
Finally, we want to start the best and most comprehensive directory of health blogs from across the globe.</p>
<p>Basically, we want to help in the better utilization of blogs for the enhancement of teaching and learning productivity, advancements in scientific research, and support for continuing medical and patient education.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I have conducted and published a research regarding medical bloggers recently (<a href="http://www.jmir.org/2008/3/e28/HTML">http://www.jmir.org/2008/3/e28/HTML</a>) and we have realized that there is a great need for something like this. Also we are sure health bloggers will be very supportive of this initiative and I expect that this website would have a lot of traffic and that many bloggers would like to it and include its banner (that is why we want a nice logo :) because all others similar in healthcare are awful)</p>
<p>I think observatory is OK. To me it sound good, I do not feel that observatory needs to be automatically linked with stars.</p>

<p>i see how observatory could work in the metaphorical sense.</p>
<p>Health Blogs Observer might be another option.</p>
<p>best of luck.</p>
