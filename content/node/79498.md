  what's presented on their site which covers the Times family. When was it (Times)
  redesigned and by who? Just the sort of information one would find in a colophon's
  note about type.\r\n\r\nAppreciatively,\r\nLuca"

    Ten, and by who, if known. Kind regards, Luca

    Parker</a> of <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/\">Font Bureau</a> about this.
    Trust me. I have spoken to him about just this myself. My poor memory tells me
    it\u2019s a version that was re-drawn from some old found 10 point specimens hence
    the name Times 10. I don\u2019t recall who, but I do recall that talking to Mike
    Parker is a real treat. Set aside an hour. You will never regret it. Long/short,
    get yourself a copy of <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Starling/\">Starling</a>."
