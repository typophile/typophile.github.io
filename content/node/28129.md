  via train & car. What do you recommend? If you don't have type stuff I will accept
  alternative suggestions. I hear there is a nice Museum..

  body: "Make sure you run up the steps of the art museum and do the rocky thing,
    JUST to make sure everyone knows you're a tourist.'\r\n\r\nRittenhouse square
    is nice to have a walk around. If you've only got a couple hours,tho, the art
    museum is probably your best bet. OR, you could just walk the streets. Philly
    holds the record for the most remaining historical buildings or something like
    that. It's got LOTS of character. \r\n\r\nOr Penn's landing, nice riverview, they've
    got a submarine down there."
