  like to let you all know I really enjoy reading your posts regarding logo critique.
  I happily spend many hours reading (and learning) though your various comments.\r\n\r\nI
  was wondering if I could get your feedback on the logo below. I was asked (as a
  free favour) to design a logo for this start up marketing consultancy company. The
  name of the company is Caerus \u2013 named after a Greek god of opportunity who
  was known for having a single lock of hair on the front of his bald head. The logic
  is that as opportunity approached one could only grab it from the front (his single
  lock of hair), if it passed, you would miss it (only grabbing his bald head and
  unable to catch him). Does that make sense?\r\n\r\nThe client wanted to have an
  abstract mark, nothing too flash as she wants something \u201Cdown to earth\u201D.
  She also wasn\u2019t afraid of white space (\u201Cbig fan of white space\u201D).
  She also mentioned that because it\u2019s only a small start-up her font of choice
  will probably be Calibri.\r\n\r\nMy initial sketches didn\u2019t produce anything
  too spectacular, but a lot of my focus went into the actually abstract look of the
  Caerus god, as I was finding it difficult to convey \u201Cgrabbing opportunity\u201D
  visually as well as keeping it abstract.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I got a decent sketch
  of the Cereus god with his single lock of hair and then moulded it together with
  pieces of the Calibri font to help tie it in to her chosen font.\r\n\r\nCould you
  please provide me any feedback or other possible directions I could take this? I\u2019m
  still a student at graphic design school, so please excuse my amateur attempt, I\u2019m
  still learning :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nManny\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I keep wanting to read the mark as an 'a' or 'al', then I wonder why the
    company name starts with 'C'. I would either make it more obvious that it's a
    face/head with hair, or make it look like a 'C' (or at least not like any other
    letter).\r\n\r\nAlso, I would highly advise trying to convince the client to not
    use a system font that everybody has installed for their company logo. It may
    be a startup, but good fonts can be had for $15 to $50. The cost is well worth
    the perceived increase in professionalism.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I like the
    colour scheme and layout of the red card.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    in a few of my sketches, I will go back and see if I can get something a bit better.\r\n\r\nYes,
    I totally agree about your comment regarding the fonts, and I will mention this
    to her. Any suggestions for a suitable font change?"

    of hair it looks more like a girl's pony-tail. And I agree with Lex on the font
    issue. There is a font for every budget. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing your
    next round of designs. This project is an interesting challenge."

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments Kirsten.\r\n\r\nYes again, I agree. It
    really helps getting some fresh eyes to give you that new perspective.\r\n\r\nI've
    tried to work in a more \"C\" like shape into the designs as well as a couple
    of attempts to make the face look, well...more like a face.\r\n\r\nI'm personally
    liking the look of \"A\" (see attached png), I think it's simple, gives the impression
    of a \"C\" and hopefully comes across looking like a lock of hair.\r\n\r\nComments?\r\n\r\n-

  body: C. does nothing for me, B. looks like a Mardi Gras mask, A. The symbol doesn't
    look at all like a lock of hair. Maybe it doesn't need to. I had no idea who Caerus
    was until this post, an abstract symbol may be more appropriate than a representational
    one. However all that said, you really shouldn't continue without making a determination
    about the font. The font should influence the icon design and vise versa. It's
    a bad practice to work on a graphic, refine it and then just slap down type next
    to the graphic.
