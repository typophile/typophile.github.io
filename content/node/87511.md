body: "I've made a custom logotype based off of H&FJ's Archer. I tore off the ball
  serif, and made them all slab-ish, and brought down the cap-height. The result was
  a significant change to Archer's standard ffi ligature on the word \"Office.\"\r\n\r\nAside
  from critiques on the ligature, I'm happy to hear any other points of concern. Especially,
  I'm not in love with the \"c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance![img:sites/default/files/old-images/PO_4611.png]"

  body: "I definitely prefer the first variant where the first /f/ hangs closer to
    the second. The imbalance of the /c/ can be corrected in two ways: either shorten
    the upper serifed terminal (my recommendation) or lengthen the lower terminal.
    This with the purpose of <strong>optically</strong> aligning both ends vertically.
    Subsequently, you will be able to kern the /e/ a bit tighter.\r\n\r\nIt is my
    impression that the pair /bo/ is kerned tighter than /od/.\r\n\r\nI'd separate
    the capital /P/ away from the /e/ one point or two.\r\n\r\nIf the gap between
    /y/ and /O/ is supposed to represent a /space/, to my eyes it looks like kerning
    has been left out.\r\n\r\nI hope my comments help. Archer was a good desition!
    :-)"

    I'll flush out the kerning a little better, and play around with the 'c' optically.
