  body: "Steve as you probably know, I use our software (Find my Font) to find the
    fonts.\r\nThe letter selection function of FmF works like a flood-fill operation
    - actually: a flood-copy operation, which copies the letter you click on, and
    works the same on black or white color letters without any need to pre-process
    the original image, the only requirement is to have a different color boundary.\r\n\r\nSee
    in the image bellow how the application screen will look like when you select
    the last letter (all selected letters are transferred in the lower left panel
    with black color, and then you type the letters and hit the match button).\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure I correctly understood your question, but I hope that helps..\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beast_fmf_5912.jpg]"

    a question for dennis, not for me - sorry for the misunderstanding.\r\nI suppose
    Dennis wanted to make a new scalable logo with color (or at least a logo bigger
    than the original image) otherwise you are right, you could simply add color to
    the existing one.\r\n"

  body: Steve, I do like yo add colours and make a little change to the Logo and when
    I scale the logo it becomes Pixelated as they do not have any high res format
    of it
