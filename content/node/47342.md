    really? Doesn\u2019t say so anywhere on Unzipped, does it?\r\n\r\nNo holidays
    for me anyway.\r\n\r\nYves, where are you? I think the Quizes need to be updated/refreshed.\r\nAnd
    \u2013 I\u2019m missing the (x)es and your comments here and there."

  body: "The rules were added a little later because we had to decide if we'd limit
    the contest to the Benelux or not. We <em>are</em> giving away ten FontBooks after
    all.\r\n\r\nAs for my apparent absence -- I'm in a major transition period. Thing's
    will improve after the switch on August 1st. ;^)"
