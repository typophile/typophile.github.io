      So it should be edited as a font....\r\n\r\nThank you anyway"

  body: It is indeed hand lettered, and is a variety of Spencerian script, so look
    at Spencerian-influenced typefaces.

    body: "Ok, thank you. But they dont look exactely like the font.\r\nTake a look
      at the covers attached... They use this font, and i dont think they hand-write
      it for each issue ! Also, i saw it on other printed matters.\r\n\r\nSpencerian
      is the more similar, but i think that a font inspired by the handwriting letters
      of Herb Lubalin does exist. Well, seems hard to find !\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/covers_6058.jpg]"

    I never even had the pleasure of meeting Herb Lubalin. He started teaching typography
    at Cooper Union <em>after</em> I graduated. By the time I became involved with
    ITC and PLINC he had passed away (1981)."

    NOT the same as the posted sample we were asked about. There is an old font called
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/treasury/\">Treasury</a> that
    has been recently revived by Canada Type. It has some resemblances to the hand-drawn
    lettering of the sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    the fancy calligraphic scripts? Certainly that's who shows up in the Photo-Lettering
    Catalogs with the Spencerian script styles, along with M. M. Davison and Frank
    Bartuska (among others).\r\n\r\nJust trying to see if we can give the design credit

  body: "Yeah, what I gathered from research was that Lubalin used a croquil pen (which
    by the way, anyone know where one goes about finding such a device?) to do the
    sketches and then would hand them on to a partner to do the \"grunt work.\" \r\n\r\nOn
    Spencerian Script: There's a book with some nice samples of early american penmanship
    called \"An Elegant Hand: The Golden Age of American Penmanship and Calligraphy\"
    by William E. Henning, Paul Melzer. Lots of interesting writing (and some illustrations
    using the writing techniques/drills) by people that had more patience than I could
    ever have... they tell how young Platt Spencer saved and saved for one sheet of
    paper and up until that day he had been practicing his writing on bark! It's out
    of print but worth checking out if your library has it or you find it at a good
    price.  "

    (taken probably from the reproduction in Leslie Cabarga's book) are either the
    work of or inspired by Tony DiSpigna.\r\n\r\nWithout his personal development
    of script forms, none of these would exist. And another reason for all designers
    to learn how to draw without beziers... "

    some point, so it is possible that while Lubalin designed Weeliam's example, one
    of the others might have lettered it.
