body: Does anyone know of a font or lettering similar to the attachment, I have roughly
  redrawn it from lettering on Breton fishing vessels form around 1900. I am looking
  for a more complete alphabet to help me create a typeface.

    Tuscan]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/hessian/|Hessian]]. I guess
    you're going to have to imagine what quirks someone who didn't have a background
    in lettering would put into these forms. \r\n\r\nHave you checked pictures of
    Cornish fishing vessels from this era? I'm sure I've seen pretty similar lettering
    in a 1930s GPO film."
