body: I often want to comment on the type in movies on my blog, but Apple's OS screen
  capturing won't work when iDVD is playing, and I don't like giving long descriptions
  when a single image will do much better. Can anyone suggest any apps (the cheaper
  the better, but I'm willing to pay for it) that will ignore this restriction and
  allow me to capture stills from DVDs I'm playing on my mac?

    capture program isn't the issue. Also, when you say iDVD I assume you mean DVD
    Player...\r\n\r\nYou need to use a different player, try VLC, it is free and it
    plays almost every format, and you can take standard screenshots while watching
    vids.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/14738\r\n\r\nr.k"

    issue? Mark Simonson's <a href=\"http://www.marksimonson.com/?c=Son+of+Typecasting\">Son
    of Typecasting</a> has gone without problems, so I'm not too worried. I'll check
    out Snapz Pro X.\r\n\r\nRob, Yes, I meant DVD player. It's become a habit to append
    'i's on Apple iProducts. See? I can't stop. I've actually already got VLC for
    AVIs, so I'll give that a try, too. Though what I'm really interested in is a
    screen capture app with no restrictions.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    dvd player on 10.4 yet. I didn't realize that it actually inhibited you from taking
    the picture. I remember, back in the day, being able to make a capture, but the
    dvd window would be black\u2014 that was probably a limitation of the video card
    in my powerbook though.\r\n\r\nIn any case, snapz pro does work and so does this
    free dashboard widget. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/business/capture.html\r\n\r\nr.k"

    the copyright issue, for review/analysis purposes, you're fine with the law. As
    to whether your fine with MPAA 7-figured-salaried-lawyer-hounds, who knows? ;o)"

  body: "Snapz Pro can do it. That's what I've been using lately. \r\n\r\nThe ones
    in my Typecasting series were done over several years. The earliest ones were
    done with a VCR hooked up to an AV-input-equiped Mac and the Apple Video Player
    (pre OS X) with which you could use command-C (Copy) to grab a frame. Most of
    the later ones were done with VLC. It works okay, but navigation was kind of tricky
    (maybe it's better now--I haven't tried the latest version recently). Snapz Pro
    lets you get frames from the Apple DVD Player, which I prefer because performance
    and navigation are better than VLC (assuming it hasn't gotten better since the
    last time I used it). Even so, the video card may prevent it in some models. (I
    think it has to support Quartz Extreme or something.)"
