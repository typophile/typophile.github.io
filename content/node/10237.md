  body: 'Which? Magazine &#40;which is the same as your sample I believe&#41; uses
    is a custom-designed font family simply called Which. There is a serif &#40;like
    the sample &#41; and a sans in a variety of weights. I don&#39;t know who designed
    it.  <BR> <BR>Marc&#39;s suggestion of FF Sheriff is an excellent one since the
    lowercase looks nearly identical. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was the same
    designer.  <BR> <BR>Here are samples:  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69475.jpg"

  body: I did it for Which? magazine, so only they can use it. Sorry! <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t
    do FF Sheriff. <BR> <BR>PS. James - how did you get these samples. Looks like
    somebody has been manual kerning on the serif; a bit tight between m and o.
