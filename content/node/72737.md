body: "First of all-- greetings and salutations. I've been a long-time lurker of this
  forum but only just signed up. Why? Well because I need assistance, of course! I've
  spent way too much time looking for this font on my own and finally decided to call
  for help.\r\n\r\nAlso, I hope I'm posting this to the right forum and not breaking
  the rules of etiquette TOO badly by asking for help right off the bat. Feel free
  to give me a severe virtual tongue-lashing if necessary. \r\n\r\nAnyway. I'm looking
  for a font that matches or comes close to the lovely calligraphic style on the attached
  image. Of course, it may be custom hand lettering, but my gut instinct says it is
  at most a customized typeface. If you fine people could please take a look and let
  me know if it looks familiar, I'd be so grateful! \r\n\r\nThanks in advance! "
