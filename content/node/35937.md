body: "Salutations friends of type! I come here to continue my education. I would
  like to communicate with any of you interested in helping me get started translating
  my original artwork into stable, usable fonts. Software recommendations, short courses,
  recommended reading and any other suggestions would be followed upon receipt of
  notes, communications of any sort.\r\n\r\nI am a traditionalist coming from a background
  of fine art and having taught myself letter press some years ago in undergrad school
  at Berea College in Kentucky. The letter press there has now been sold off. Now
  the digital revelotion is upon us all. I'm working with a friend in Celo, NC producing
  mono prints and small editions which include letter press work. My interest is visiting
  here is to discover a work flow envolving Macintosh computers moving back out into
  the world of book production.\r\n\r\nI'm a serious student of color science, a printmaker
  and photographer. As well my skills in freehand work are continually being honed.
  If any of you choose to communicate with me about digital typography I will, in
  turn, continue to share with all who come to me to learn. Such is the \"old school\"
  method. Sorely needed is a mentoring program for every area of life skills as well
  as trades and theoretical studies. I am honored to be amongst you.\r\n\r\nHighest
  regards,\r\n\r\nFrederick Park\r\nfrederick@apalache.com"
