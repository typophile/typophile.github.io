  that converts the corners of the glyphs in your fonts according to user-defined
  parameters.\r\n\r\nIt automates the process yet lets you keep complete control as
  a designer. You determine the parameters: the black and the white corners. RoundingUFO
  doesn't mess around with your contours; the necessary points are added.\r\n\r\nWith
  RoundingUFO considerably speeds up the production process, without loss of quality.
  All UFO's generated with roundingUFO can be interpolated.\r\n\r\nAdditional features
  include: adding ink traps or simply cutting off the corners instead of adding rounding
  them.\r\n\r\ngo check it out [[http://roundingufo.typemytype.com/]]\r\n\r\nyours
  sincerely [[http://www.typemytype.com/|Frederik]]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "After playing around with it a bit, I really like what's going on. I'm afraid
    it might be a little oversimplified, but it does what it says it will do, and
    where I've found unexpected results it seems the fault lies in my design. \r\n\r\nIf
    I could suggest improvements:\r\n\r\nSliders are nice and simple, but it would
    be useful to be able to input numerical values too. Plus, it would be interesting
    (though probably not terribly useful) to see what happens when negative values
    are entered.\r\n\r\nExcept for the slider for the \"Ignore Short Segment\" feature.
    Unless I'm mistaken it seems to do nothing but turn the feature on and off, and
    the slider is not marked for which end is which, so it's hard to tell if it's
    on unless there is an affected corner in the design. That would be better served
    with a check box, unless the slider is doing something I'm not seeing.\r\n\r\nI
    would like to be able to apply different settings to specific corners, rather
    than the same ones to the whole font or glyph. Global settings have their place
    to make the effect consistent and quick, but massaging glyph by glyph, corner
    by corner is necessary after that.\r\n\r\nThere could be more ink trap shapes.
    As it is they come to a box end, but they could come to a point, a wedge, a rounded
    end, or a bulb, or possibly other options I haven't thought of. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut
    even as it stands, this is a great and useful accessory that I and I'm sure many
    others have been waiting for for a long time, and I am grateful it's being offered
    for free. \r\n\r\nThank you Frederik!"

    of the site is the price or that the save feature is disabled mentioned.\r\n\r\nOn
    the front page is a big shiny \"download\" button, while the order and license

    demo, nor of the price for the full version."

    either sense of the word. That's a decision for its author and to be respected.
    But feature-disabled demonstrations must be clearly marked as such.

    corners, ......\"\r\nThat's not really possible, but you set different parameters
    for each glyph just by double clicking a glyph. Then you are able to store local
    parameters for that glyph instead of using the local ones. see the [[http://roundingufo.typemytype.com/documentation.html|documentation]]
    :)\r\n\r\n\"Except for the slider for the \u201CIgnore Short Segment\u201D feature......\"\r\nThis
    is \"deleting\" short segments which are shorter then the slider value. It only
    apply on really small segments otherwise your contour would be distorted too much.\r\n\r\n\r\non
