  Script is an experimental font designed by Carlos Fabian Camargo G. Its fantasy
  design contains 1463 glyphs to compose words, phrases and short messages on small
  and large sizes. The idea was born in a sketchbook that was perfected again by hand
  and achieving \"non-neutral drawings\" on tracing paper. With bezier digitization
  the empty and full parts of letters appeared with soft and eloquent curves as calligraphic
  result produces optimal readability.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_6383.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_6380.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_5851.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_5559.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_3732.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_5894.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/7_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_6594.png]"
