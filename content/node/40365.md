  was just getting underway. It has since become a rich forum for discussing found
  type and lettering. I invite you to take a look through the posts and possibly become
  contributors (I am particularly looking for contributors outside of my place of
  residence, Toronto, to broaden the spectrum). \r\n\r\nNow that the holidays are
  coming to an end, I will be adding more and more content daily and working on some
  of the villatype projects."

    you can (and should) hunt for in the mean time. In Union Station in the VIA arrivals
    corridors as you would be leaving the trains, there are hand panted signs, quite
    possibly dating from 1919, that say \"To City\" with lovely long arrows underneath.
    Should be got before they do too much damage with the renovations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
