  already learned many things <BR>about type that I didn&#39;t know before. <BR> <BR>I
  was wondering if anyone had any <BR>suggestions about books or <BR>resources that
  are ESSENTIAL <BR>for a young designer looking <BR>to learn more about typography.
  <BR> <BR>So far, I&#39;ve been told: <BR>Robert Bringhurst- The Elements <BR>of
  Typographic Style <BR> <BR>and: <BR> <BR>Erik Spiekermann- Stop Stealing <BR>Sheep
  &amp; find out how type works'
