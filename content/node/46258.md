  body: Didn't find it because it's not a font. Probably custom lettering, despite
    any repetition. If you like the "R", try <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/grand_central/?sample_text=FOREIGN%20AFFAIRS">Grand
    Central</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=romana&sample_text=FOREIGN%20AFFAIRS">Romana</a>.
