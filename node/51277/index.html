  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey guys, I have done several logos throughout the years for various size business where people requested the TM mark on the logo. I have also seen the mark on many other logos of both small and large companies. I was wondering what is the actual legality of this mark? Can you just seemingly throw it on the end of a logo and it hold some real meaning? Should I refuse to use it just because of a client request. I&rsquo;m sure some of you guys really know what you are talking about and I would love to hear it from you all.</div>

<p>The value of the advice given here (legal or otherwise) certainly exceeds the price you paid for it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jeremiah—to the best of my knowledge and experience working at branding and branding communications—no legal requirement exists for a logo or any form of branding to use the TM mark provided the owner of the brand / logo makes use of it to identify their products / services / business / trade. The TM mark amounts to an assertion of the branding / logo as the brand used in trade by its owner. As noted on a similar recent thread, the only legal stipulation is that the owner use the brand on their stuff and engage in trade with that stuff and a customer or two.</p>
<p>By contrast (R) or ® cannot be used unless the brand owner has registered their logo(s) and branding with the trademark /patents office.</p>
<p>Designers may include the TM mark if they want to, as a nod to professionalism, either by request of the commissioning client, or voluntarily, but there&rsquo;s no responsibility for designers to do so per se. It&rsquo;s optional.</p>

Click on the Trademarks tab</p>
<p>What is the difference between TM and the R within the circle ®?</p>
<p>Use of the TM and SM symbols may be governed by local, state, or foreign laws and the laws of a pertinent jurisdiction to identify the marks that a party claims rights to. The federal registration symbol, the R enclosed within a circle, may be used once the mark is actually registered in the USPTO. Even though an application is pending, the registration symbol may not be used before the mark has actually become registered.</p>
<p>The federal registration symbol should only be used on goods or services that are the subject of the federal trademark registration.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: Several foreign countries use the letter R enclosed within a circle to indicate that a mark is registered in that country. Use of the symbol by the holder of a foreign registration may be proper.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;ve been asked to follow those guidelines on several logos. i have not seen the actual laws, just followed my clients request. 
in one case it was a major university with a team of lawyers, so i hope they know something&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I only include it if I&rsquo;m asked. The less going on the better in a logo most of the time. It also frequently becomes a blob when produced small.</p>
<p>I have also had to attach it to a performers name. That was grotesque since of course there was a war about how big it should be.</p>
<p>I have also attached it to the phrase &ldquo;One Night Only&rdquo; believe it or not. That had me almost rolling on the floor. As if something like that should be allowed to be trademarked. You can trademark a phrase like this within a certain industry, which now that I think of it should become an industry all to itself, sort of like hoarding URL names.</p>
<p>I wonder if God™ would be enforceable? Or the™?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I find such gaudy attempts at showing you own the logo to be disgusting.</p>
<p>If there is any doubt as to the owner of a mark or brand, then it&rsquo;s the fault of the logo itself for not communicating effectively.</p>
<p>For me, I think these things, especially with the use taglines that are trademarked should be so effective that everybody inherently <em>knows</em> who they belong to, and it&rsquo;s often smaller or immature business owners that have such a greed for their property.</p>
<p>Imagine if these things were spoken in the same voice that the text is set in.</p>
<p>Welcome to First Baptist Church. we own that logo.  Come on in t find Spiritual Healing, which is our own trademarked phrase, as well as find God, we own rights on him too.</p>
<p>That would just be silly.  I would ask any client who wants/demands any mark like that this:</p>
<p>I am the designer, and before I allow any design element into the logo I have to have a rationale for it being there.  Can you provide me with an adequate rationale on why this element needs to be added, and how this will help you achieve the strategy we decided on at the beginning of the project?</p>
<p>Or alternatively:</p>
<p>Who is the undisputed leader in their industry.  What does their branding look like?  Do companies who make it to the top have such displays?  Do they rely on such attempts to let people know their branding.</p>
