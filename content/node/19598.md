body: "I have a slight case of OCD. Although, I'd be willing to bet that most graphic
  designers do. It is part of the job to have an insane obsession with details. Anyway,
  as I struggle with obsessing over the details, sometimes it spills over into not
  wanting wrinkles on my bed or color coding my closet ... and even folding my t-shirts.
  I received this in my e-mail today and suddenly felt a wave of normality wash over
  me when I realized that at least I didn't fold my t-shirts <em>this</em> perfectly.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typegirl.com/temp/HowtoFoldaShirt.MPG/"

  body: Haha, I was actually telling some girl about that folding method the other
    day because she loves cleaning like nobody I've ever seen. Now I can actually
    show her what I was talking about.

    bundle in about 10 minutes.

    method is out there though."

  body: "My OCD-like symptoms manifest themselves in strange ways. I have to wash
    my hands every 30 minutes or less, for example. I can leave things absolutely
    messy all of the time, but the moment I arrange something it has to be perfect.
    I create \"margins\" around objects when tidying up my desk. Recently my boss
    asked me to tidy up a bit, and I replied \"I forgive you, for you know not what
    you do.\" \r\n\r\nThere's now a near-perfect 1/4\" margin surrounding everything
    from my phone to the stapler.\r\n\r\n...I will be folding everything in my closet
    when I get home. \r\n\r\nFailure is the condiment that flavours success - Truman

  body: "I've got OCD in my family, but I just have some of the chemical vestiges
    of it; my problems are different, for the most part. Still, I do find myself--
    like someone mentioned above-- careening between unholy tornadic messiness and
    extreme neatness. When I do swing in the neatness direction, I always have a method,
    and I'm ferocious about it. Not one speck of dust, not one unwiped spot. Even
    as a child, I cleaned my room in \"rows,\" kind of like a vacuum cleaner or lawnmower.
    \ I still do it-- something about moving along the surface from 0,0 to x,y that
    just \"satisfies\"! One of my earliest memories is of picking up bits of lint
    and placing them neatly in a pill bottle that my dad used for electrical components
    like resistors and capacitors. Still, I am patient only in bursts (impatiently
    patient?). I can spend three hours sorting screws on my workbench, but it'll take
    a few months before I'm ready to do that again (most recently, I spent 90 minutes
    removing every one of a couple hundred nails from a pile of mostly rotten roof
    planks). As for clothing, I have folding methods, but I think a lot of people
    do. What I find curious, though, is that I fold things differently than I used
    to. Like, my mother taught me how to make a \"ball\" out of a pair of socks by
    rolling them up and wrapping the open end back 'round the ball thus formed. Now
    I just put them together and wrap the end down about an inch or so, just enough
    to keep them bound together. When and why did that change, I wonder? The only
    indication that any of this is OCD is that I had to forbid my wife from folding
    my t-shirts, because her method just got under my skin and I had to re-fold them
    all. I don't know if she's forgiven me yet (\"Fold your own damn t-shirts!\" Ok,
    yes, gladly, thanks dear!)\r\n\r\nOkay, I guess I'm sounding a lot more OCD than
    I thought. Come to think of it, I usually post, edit, and re-post everything I
    write here about three or four times. \r\n\r\nYikes!"
