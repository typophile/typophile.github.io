body: "Hi all Typophiles,\r\n\r\nHaving just released my first three commercial fonts
  at [[Veer]] as part fo their [[Umbrella]] Type Library. I thought I celebrate it
  (other than drinking beer) by giving a little teaser here. The fonts are Navelfluff,
  Trentor and Trentor Script.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/veer_releases_4378.jpg]\r\n\r\nMore
  of the fonts can be seen at my studio\u2019s webpage, [[Autodidakt]] or at Veer.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.autodidakt.se\r\n\r\nCurrently
  I\u2019m working on several other projects, which hopefully can be spotten in the
  near future aswell.\r\n\r\nThanks all you guys who helped me with all my stupid
  questions I had along the way, producing these fonts :)\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nG\xF6ran
