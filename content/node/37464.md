  in InDesign?\r\nUsing an example of 3 words: It would be a word (flush left) with
  a shift-tab to space to the second word, and another shift-tab to the third word
  which would appear flush right. The second word would be centered between the first
  and third word with equal space before and after.\r\nCan't find anything relating
  to this in the Help Center, but I don't know what it would be called in InDesign.
  It certainly isn't called Quad Tabs!"

    between each other, force to justified and you'll have you 3 words equal spaced.
    Hoping is what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    each item. Then set your first tab stop to be right aligned, the second to be
    center aligned and the third to be left aligned.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tab_example_4674.jpg]\r\n\r\nEven
    though you make 4 tabs you only set 3 tab stops. The first one is just to move
    the text over."
