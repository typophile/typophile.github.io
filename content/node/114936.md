  body: Sorry but a way too small and blurry for my eyes. Really need a better sample
    or at least the origin of the sample...

  body: Can somebody find the font for me? I asked it even in the old ID board. Sorry
    for that, but the font is very crucial. Found in an ebook in one of my friend's.
    He too wants to know the font name and type.

  body: I tried but even with your new sample, I wasn't able to find it. This one
    is still in bad condition.

  body: Its not in bad shape the font itself is the same and clear. Yes it has a discontinuing
    trait when seen at once. But when you look at the same identical letters in the
    different words they are the same. E.g. the p and d's have a doted at their drops
    and the t is particularly discontinued.

  body: OK, I see (actually not ;) what you're meaning. So, I'm afraid I'd be totally
    helpless on that one. Sorry for that.
