  working on redesigning a magazine that's about helicopters.  I think the current
  set of fonts looks a bit dated (most body text in Dutch 801, headlines in Futura).
  \ I'm looking at a lot of helicopter trade magazines and noticing most of them use
  sans-serif for the body text.\r\n\r\nCould anyone make any font suggestions?  I'm
  looking at Gotham Narrow (don't own that one but might invest).  I like News Gothic,
  but there aren't enough variations in the family.  I probably use Helvetica a little
  too often.  I'm looking for something that's easy to read but with a little bit
  of style to it.  Does the helicopter subject suggest anything to anyone?\r\n\r\nI
  could also just change to a different serif for the body text but just noticed most
  of the trade mags are in a sans.\r\n\r\nI'll be the first to admit I'm not great
  at picking out fonts.  That's why I'm posting.  :-)  I have the Adobe folio (so
  could use any of those) though I'd also consider investing in something new.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks, phyllis\r\n"

    Sans is quite nice for text.\r\nThe Museos have many styles (slab, rounded, serif

    Sans and Benton Sans appeal to me a lot, and the others are very cool too. Love
    the way these have square dots on the i's -- that actually matches our logo. :-)\r\n\r\nThanks,

    conceited fellow that I am\u2014being quite familiar with them it saves me the
    trouble of having to check out someone else's typeface to see if it really would
    \"fit the bill\" as well as one's first inclination would suggest.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I didn't design Museo, although I wish I had. I've never worked with it, but I've
    seen it around a lot (e.g. for Dell) and did take another look at it, at MyFonts,
    considering it with regards to this thread, before I recommended it.  \r\n\r\n"

    what - this is such a case!  :->\r\nPhyllis, I think you want something serious,
    sharp, rigid but dynamic. These are things Nina St\xF6ssinger was looking for
    when choosing fonts for two recent projects - a novel, and INFOsperber:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/5558904732/\r\nThe
    body text is set in the Roman component of the family (see below).\r\nSample from
    another book: http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4177918056\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/5571195204/\r\nhttp://infosperber.ch/\r\n\r\nThe
    font is called (actually, code-named) Harrier, and it's part of a system that
    includes a Roman and an Italic (Harrier is better termed a slanted-Roman.) However
    there's no sans in the family yet, so it might have limited versatility for your
    project. Anyway, let me know if your curiosity is piqued: hpapazian at gmail dotcom.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
