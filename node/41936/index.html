<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>today we took lecture about visual juxtaposition
and choose five words every worn in each composition
using only one type
these compositins should communicate and express each word's definition. In these creations the elements should be combined creatively.and we can reduce or enlarge our type and we can repeat the word as many times we feel apropriate.
plz I wannna some examples to understand more better
plz
the words are heavy noise dizzy rage fused apathy stretched</div>

<div class=commentbody>Feraslove - I don't want to sound mean, but here at Typophile we often have students coming to us for advice. In general I think we aim to be as helpful as we can. But in your case (and we've seen this before) it seems like you are asking us to do your homework for you. If you want to post some samples of the work you've done for advice/opinions then that seems like a better approach than asking us to have the ideas for you. I'm sure your teacher doesn't want us doing your work for you.
Look at the words, close your eyes, think of what comes to mind, and try to express that using type. Those are all potentially very visual words, you should be able to come up with something. Then if you want us to weigh in, fine.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, you should also probably try and help yourself a bit more :).
One idea would be to find a famous quote on each of those words and try to make a composition out of it. Had you tried looking at these examples?:
http://www.designingwithtype.com/essays/essaySiskind.html
http://www.designingwithtype.com/essays/2_1.html
http://www.designingwithtype.com/essays/2_4.html
http://www.designingwithtype.com/essays/2_8.html
http://www.designingwithtype.com/essays/2_17.html
http://www.designingwithtype.com/essays/essayCarson.html
Another way would be to do something as straightfoward as this:

Once you've done something of your own, post it here. At that point you can get a lot more ideas and help.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Okay, some thoughts:
There are fonts/weights that say ‘heavy’ more explicitly; look for ‘ultra bold’, ‘heavy’, ‘black’, ‘super’ weights
Do you really need several instances of the word? Does it help to communicate the idea of ‘heavy’?
The layering and the varying sizes/colours imply a three-dimensional space. Does this help?
Does the overall image say ‘heavy’, or rather ‘messy’, ‘crashing’, ‘falling’?</div>

<div class=commentbody>This seems closer to one of your other words, 'Noise' :)
Maybe you can try looking at the words with some more humour.... think of what happens to very heavy people or things. Try and show that with type.
Heavy is a relative term. So you may need to show something that's a lot lighter in comparison. </div>

There was a famous poster in the '70s that was a red rectangle (maybe square) and had the word "Helvetica" set along one edge in some flavor of Garamond. I wish I could recall more detail about it. I had some graphic design magazines from the era and it seemed to be a popular joke even then. I wish I knew where they were now.</div>

That sounds like the one. I believe there were T-shirts too.
"Based on age and language limitations I don’t think humor and irony are gonna fly here"
Probably. On the other hand, I started getting confident enough to try doing things using type and images after stumbling upon a book by Bob Gill ('Forget all the rules...'). What worked for me was that he made it all so amusing. Just might work for our friend here too. </div>

I can't agree with you more, but it seem to be a bit of a losing battle these days. We get job applications from well-educated designers written that way! In this case however, English may not be the language he is most comfortable with. </div>
