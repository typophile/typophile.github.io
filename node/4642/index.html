We are a design and application development company, just starting out. This is quite simple and I would like to keep it as simple as possible. <BR> <BR>Could anyone give me some suggestions on how to improve it.

		<div class="commentbody">hey Dave... i agree with the folks here... i really don&#39;t know by looking at the logo what its about... what the company is about... i really like the typeface and the nice soft blues u have used.. maybe trying to push the idea of Pulse a bit ?.. as u are playing with colours here... how bout tryin to show pulse with colours ? ... for some reason everytime i look at the logo i feel that the 2 dots are not placed properly and are too much at the bottom relating to the form of the letter &#34;P&#34;  how bout tryin to make them a bit smaller and takin them up by 1-2 points ? ... good luck</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you everyone for taking a look and letting me know what you think, I truly appreciate the time and effort. <BR> <BR>Ive been think about somehow trying to get acoss with the logo, that we are a design/application company.  Im at a loss. Im trying to keep it a simple as possible, using only elements of type in the logo. <BR> <BR>Do you think it necessary to have a tagline for instance. If you saw IBM logo for the first time ever, would you know that that were about computers and related technology? This is what is stumping me on this one.  <BR> <BR>On one hand, of course, I would love to be able to get the idea across instantly. On the other, I think that the site and related print materials will do the job. <BR> <BR>Opinions much appreciated. <BR> <BR>Here are a few variations. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35587.gif" alt="Log2"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">hey again Dave... with these ones when i look at them i think of some music company or any company relating to sound...  also try using the letter &#34;L&#34; with the blue instead of having &#34;P&#34; as blue coz it might show &#34;pulse&#34; with colours... but  i dont think it would be a solution to your problem because it will lay too much attention on the &#34;L&#34; when u want to emphasize on &#34;P&#34; .. but a suggestion anyways... laters !</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I do not see why the logo needs in any way to &#34;enact&#34; a pulse. It says pulse already, to anyone who can read. Anyone who does not &#34;get&#34; pulse from the word &#34;pulse&#34; is missing something pretty basic. I suspect that most attempts to embody some sort of pulsing in the logo will either &#40;a&#41; be so obvious they look ghastly &#40;the heart monitor&#41; or &#40;b&#41; be so subtle they are irrelevant or &#40;c&#41; introduce unwarranted associations &#40;as I think the &#34;musical&#34; logos do&#41;. <BR> <BR>Nor can I see, with respect, why one has to get <i>design</i> from the logo. The logo will not be used in a vacuum, and presumably it will be obvious from what is around it that design is what it is about. <BR> <BR>It seems to me to be perfectly credible and indeed creditable that the logo, rather than saying <i>design</i> tells people who already know that they are dealing with a design company <i>what sort</i> of design they can expect: what its aesthetic tendency is. If the original logo does that, then I&#39;d stick with the original. <BR> <BR>The associations I&#39;d get from the original are: spare, clean &#40;super clean&#41;, perhaps a little bland, conservative &#40;in a modernist sense&#41;, understated, heavily typographical. This is the sort of design I&#39;d want for the annual report of a pharmaceutical company, not for a rock album cover. <BR> <BR>If those are the right associations, then the logo is working. If they&#39;re not then &#40;for me&#41; it&#39;s not. For instance, if you wanted to project playfulness, or political commitment, or a sense of being at the bleeding edge, the logo does not do that for me.</div>
