  project and need a sans serif.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking something geometric like Avenir
  and Futura, and something classic like helvetica and Akzidenz-Grotesk.\r\nBut still
  it needs a twist of personality to it.\r\n\r\nPrefferably I would like a quite newly
  released font (not that wildly used), but I'm open for everything old and new.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  who have any good suggestions.\r\nIt would be appreciated!\r\n\r\nSiriSiri \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    has a contemporary feel to it. \r\n\r\nYou've also got the beautiful [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans|Benton
    Gothic]] and [[http://www.linotype.com/1577/vectora-family.html|Vectora]] to choose
    from.\r\n\r\nThen there's the wonderful [[http://typophile.com/node/54679|Colympia]]
    if only someone could help me identify it.\r\n\r\nEven the simple usage of Univers,
    Trade or News Gothic or Akzidenz instead of Helvetica will help the mark stand
    out from the crowd."
