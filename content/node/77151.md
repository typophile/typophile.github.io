body: "I'm compiling a list of typefaces and trying to apply classifications beyond
  simple categories, the categories being sans-serif, serif, slab serif, etc. The
  Fedra family is a little tough. What would Fedra Serif be? I've seen the category
  \"contemporary\" applied to it, but that seems to be a little \"dated\", as the
  definition of contemporary will always change. I've seen Humanist applied to Fedra
  Sans, which makes sense.\r\n\r\nSo what is the best classification for Fedra Serif?
  Best for Fedra Sans?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    sense.

  body: "\"Humanist sans and serif...\"\r\n\r\nGood enough for me! But do you mean
    \"Humans sans\" and \"Humanist serif\", to be precise?"

  body: '"Humanist" has a very different meaning in the sans-serif and the serif worlds.
    I''d be more hesitant about calling Fedra Serif "humanist."'

  body: Old style and Venetian (is this what you're thinking of, Craig?) are both
    sub categories of Humanist serif In my world. Fedra is perhaps more Old Style?
    At least if you're looking at the x-height. Not quite sure though. It does have
    a very different feel to it than most other faces in that category - so perhaps
    at a later stage it will get a different label.

    won't put \"Contemporary\". I'd rather leave it blank then put that.\r\n\r\nNeither
    of those feel great, but I think \"Fedrist\" while certainly a propos doesn't
    clear things up much.\r\n\r\nI can't help but see Garamond (or other similar Old
    Style) when I look at either the serif or the sans (much less so) and see the
    miniscule \"a\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fedra-garamond_3718.png]"
