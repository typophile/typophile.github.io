  includes a middle-range weight; I can only find a light, roman, and bold version.
  I need to reverse it in large blocks of text, and I'm concerned with the letters
  plugging up on press and becoming hard to read (I know, I know, don't reverse body
  text, etc., etc. ...) Does anyone know of a medium weight available anywhere? Or
  an alternative typeface that is close?\r\n"
