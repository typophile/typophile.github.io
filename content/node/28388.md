  contest taking place in my home country far far away :)\r\n\r\nFrom the website:\r\n\r\n\"As
  it was during former editions of the event, the contest is open to all newspapers
  and magazines published in Europe, regardless of whether they are published in member
  states of the European Union or not. The common element is Europe, with its' rich
  diversity and multiculturalism. \r\n\r\nThis year, entries can be submitted which
  were published between 1 January, 2005 and 31 August, 2006 - due to the jury deliberation
  date being moved, we have extended the period during which submissions can be made
  for the contest by half a year. \r\n\r\nThe members of the jury overseeing this
  year's edition of the contest are a real dream team: Jacek Utko - the most recognized
  of Polish designers, currently overseeing all Bonnier Business Press publications,
  Javier Errea, Mario Feliciano, Ole Munk, Ally Palmer, Mark Porter and Rodrigo Sanchez
  - it goes without saying that this group needs no introduction. Nevertheless, their
  biographies can be found in the brochure.\"\r\n\r\n_______\r\nAL\r\n<a href=http://www.lenart.pl>lenart.pl</a>"
