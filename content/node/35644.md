    But it may be the pixel variations at a small size.

    eric gill's eponymous typeface

  body: yep, i still remember enjoying watching the signwriter at the first place
    i worked... his lettering was virtually indistinguishable from letrasetted type,
    fluently written with a brush...

    it originated, those glyphs at least must be digital, as they match the site's
    banner JPG\r\n\r\nI see they've got Gill on one of their other posters."
