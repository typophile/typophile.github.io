body: "I'm looking for a typeface for a tattoo I want to get, but I don't like any
  of the traditional tattoo typeface's. The one's I do like are very free flowing,
  loose cursive script type's, but I think they are all real people's handwriting.
  But I thought if I posted photos (or rather the links) of the one's I like here,
  someone might be able to help me find something similar to them? \r\n\r\nhttp://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b5/ff/1e/b5ff1e52e66ed27472ebb59553632e5d.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/77/de/87/77de8744d21a9f43f08d6657e5ca4089.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7e/1a/5b/7e1a5b321589a02a4dc6112bc255c388.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9f/ec/c8/9fecc8f70defb6b3a98fb3ef571503a9.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/e9/80/c9/e980c9c78be41a0bdc067c93097b5435.jpg"
