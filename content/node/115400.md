body: 'I am trying to identify the bold and spiky font located in the top banner,
  reading "SANDSHARKS."  I could swear I have seen the font before but am having a
  hard time identifying the name. This logo was created in 2010. Any help would be
  fantastic! I have spent the better half of today searching the interwebs. '
