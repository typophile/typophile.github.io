  body: "Evan,\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure it's something by <a href=\"http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/shyfonts/shy01.htm\">ShyFonts</a>.
    <em>Intellivised</em> is pretty close.  Too bad you can't see previews of the
    different fonts on that page.\r\n\r\nAlso, you might want to browse through the
    sci-fi section at <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=303&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=DIFFERENT+STROKES&nb_ppp=10&classt=alpha\">DaFont</a>
    for similar techno-ish fonts."

  body: Not with the intent to undercut Fontshop or E&F, but both of their websites
    credit Brendel Typestudio with the design of this typeface. I thought I'd mention,
    then, that it can be had from the current Web face of Brendel Informatik, <a href="http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm"
    target="_blank">The Quick Brown Fox</a>, for nearly $10 less. It goes by the name
    there of, simply, Digital. No promise of equal quality, though.
