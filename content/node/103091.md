  I am doing a watercolor wing,\r\nand would like to figure out the proper type to
  go with it. I like the contrast between having\r\na watercolor with a slab serif,
  but want to see what others think.\r\n\r\nThe name is called:\r\n\r\nArbutus Migratory
  Bird Sanctuary.\r\n\r\n"

    It's quirky, but that's why I like it more than traditional slabs.
