    this one seems maddeningly familiar (but doesn't that happen to us all the time?).\r\n\r\nSomething
    relatively new from Font Bureau? Gotta look...\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    I remembered with triangular serifs, but that's about the only resmblance.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hey, that's right! :^) I finally settled with Warnock Pro, which his pretty
    obvious beaks as well.\r\n\r\nThere's something weird about this face -- the serifs
    on the 's' look a bit out of character..."

  body: I thought so too about the s, wonder if this is customized in some way.

  body: This one is really bothering me. I feel like its right on the tip of my tongue,
    because maybe I've seen it somewhere or I feel like I've even used a similar face
    before, but it eludes me.

  body: It's like an earthier version of Frutiger's Meridien, with a beaky r borrowed
    from FF Olsen.

  body: I think it looks more like Veljovic than Meridien or Swift from Linotype,
    but that lc 's' is different and there are slight variations in the shape of the
    wedge serifs. It also looks similar to <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/kandal.html">Kandal</a>
    by Mark  Simonson maybe he can let you know what his inspiration was, but my guess
    is Veljovic.
