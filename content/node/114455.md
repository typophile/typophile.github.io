  body: May be you'll have to admit it is Orator. Part of my personal conviction for
    it, nobody's suggested anything else and didn't even challenge the call... May
    be this person didn't pay and downloaded it for free without even knowing it was
    illegal.

  body: Agreeing with the ID, I'll mention that Orator apparently was bundled with
    some versions of Photoshop/InDesign.
