body: Hi all, I need help with my question, please. <BR> <BR>I have got final metric
  of my Bold typeface and I draw light version. Is it possible to copy or open only
  RSB from Bold? <BR>I am looking for any better way than to adjust every glyph manualy.
  I tried to print the properities list of bold and after that adjusted light metric
  according to printed informations, but I believe in clever method. <BR>Thanks
