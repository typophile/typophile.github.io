  shows the text displayed on the shoulder of the City Protective Services (CPS) suit
  from the TV show 'Continuum' (Showcase in Canada; SyFy in USA).\r\n\r\nI discovered
  the 'Zebulon' font, but although it is very similar, it is not quite right. Notably,
  the letters are not thick enough; the actual font has less spacing on the inner
  parts of the letter (hopefully you know what i mean)."

    of the 'C' and 'P'. VFX for the show likely wanted to change it up a little and
    decided to add it in - which is not hard to replicate myself.\r\n\r\nSo thank
    you fvilanakis for the help. Very much appreciated! :)"
