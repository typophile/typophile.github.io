  body: What a wonderful interview. Congratulations to Nadine for all her achievements.  A
    few years when I was struggling to digitize my AlQuds font she gave me some hints
    and support.  I also learned she was writing her PhD thesis on the legibility
    of Arabic fonts. Now that she has finished it as she mentions in the interview,
    I am very interested to read it. Any idea where it can be read?
