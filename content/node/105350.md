    the muscle car specs, engine 350 V-8 4 barrel carb,  pre-70s inflation prices
    and AM push button radio; at least it has seat belts. My dad had one, it was a
    blast to drive!\r\nPerhaps an internal font to the pricing computer -- which could
    have been an IBM mainframe or something bespoke for GM.\r\nFortunately, there
    IS a digital match -- no gross differences -- produced in 2005 by Ray Larabie
    as <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?font=linefeed&q=Go\">Linefeed</a>.\r\nDon\r\n"
