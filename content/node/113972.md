  cannot find a good rule for this...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

  body: "It is essentially  matter of editorial style, not typography. The general
    rule is, as the notes constitute a sequence, both they and the note calls in the
    text stream should all be the same. Which is not to say that some editorial house
    style couldn't be different. IIRC, Chicago uses the same font & size for all note
    calls, which would be reflected in the their <cite>Manual of Style.</cite>\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, good editorial practice usually moves a note call away from a subhead,
    and a chapter opening note is usually recast as an unnumbered note. A note to
    a subhead can also be so recast, esp. if the note is to the entire section the
    subhead introduces. But it is not the designer or compositor's job to make such
    changes.\r\n\r\n<cite>Edit:</cite> It is possible for there to be two or more
    note streams within a text. If the text itself constitutes two streams, then a
    separate style could be warranted. For example, notes to tables are a separate
    stream, and have a different numbering & usually a different size. I suppose a
    text with a lot of sidebars might use a similar structure.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    I have set text where there are two note streams throughout -- one the original
    author's notes, the second an editor's notes, as in, say, 17th century text, where
    the author's footnotes are preserved, but there are also editorial notes -- e.g.,
    about what something might have meant at the time, or notes on differences in
    different editions. In books like that, the author's notes will typically be 1,
    2, 3, etc., sometimes starting over each page, sometimes running as a sequence
    for an entire chapter. The editorial notes are almost always asterisk, dagger,
    double-dagger etc., and the sequence starts over each page. Typically, all notes
    are in the same font (includes size), but a designer could change this after conferring
    with the editors.\r\n\r\nWorst I've ever handled had three sequences, one a commentary
    on a text with commentary on the commentary, the other a simultaneous tri-lingual
    piece."
