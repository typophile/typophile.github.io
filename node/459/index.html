		<div class="commentbody">I like to think that design and typography is equally about aesthetics and creative flair as well as hard and fast rules. While i take your point that you can apply sets of rules to certain elements of typography including kerning, I think to a point it takes the fun out if it bowing to mere mathematical calculation.  <BR> <BR>The kerning of specific characters changes from font to font, but yes there are similarities between pairs of characters. I couldn't tell you whether the kerning between 'ey' is based on any mathematical rule, only that the shape of the characters means that they need to be closer together to appear visually equally spaced. <BR> <BR>Someone else might though&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's okay to have fun while working - not only in typography. I agree absolutely. But there is so much fun already working with it, that I thought, there are also some definite set of rules at least for some parts of the whole process. Like, Matthew, you say that kerning differs from font to font. True but I wasn't speaking about absolute values. I meant relative rules. Like, NM is 1 measure (1M). OK is 0.8M, WW is 0.5M and so on (hypothetically speaking). <BR>I am surprised there are no rules regarding kerning. <BR>How are kerning tabes made/calculated? I mean the ones supplied for every font. What are those principles?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ahaaa! So he was. <BR> <BR>However, Type by Design still gives a good overview of kerning. I think Alexey, you are looking for the same kind of fomula Walter Tracy gives as a start on spacing, only for kerning.  <BR> <BR>The book does give a list of important kerning pairs to consider (for english). The reason it'd be tough to make a formula is because the nature of the beast is that each one is an exception to the rule. I dunno, maybe someone's got a masterplan?  <BR> <BR>I also find it interesting the avg. number of kerning pairs are given for two foundries (at the time the book was originally published) Adobe: 100-200  and Bitstream 200-500. Those may have changed. The key for text though, is the spacing, as kerning has less influence at smaller point sizes. <BR> <BR>I'm rambling, sorry. <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding your original question, there are many ways to kern and as mentioned above it's all subjective depending on the type of type you're making . . . <BR> <BR>A text face has more predictable forms due to its nature and can actually look good without much additional kerning. In contrast, a display face that contains no repeating character forms in some cases can be riddled with kern pairs. <BR> <BR>The key to determine how many kern pairs all comes down to the quality of the spacing job on the font. It is likely a perfectly spaced font could exist without any kern pairs. <BR> <BR>Regarding rules for kerning, I have a personal theory. . . If you were to determine the absolute horizontal center of a character and draw a line at that mark then set a long string of text, I would kern anything that exceeded a certain width or percentage minding the width of the glyph. <BR> <BR>I think there is a rhythm that can be easily identified in relation to the rest of the glyphs in the typeface and to some degree could become a rule that requires kerning be applied. <BR> <BR>Beyond that, another thing to consider is that even if you decide to make as few kerning pairs as possible, if you make let's say a 'vo' kern, expect that will also be required for a 'v</div>

		<div class="commentbody">wow, thanks everybody for taking time and participating. <BR>Randy, I've downloaded the book you mentioned and will surely read the recommended chapters first (and then the whole book ^<em>^ ). <BR>Stuart, I didn't really get your concept of horizontical center, a line and kerning. Also, the concept of &quot;rhythm&quot; is hard to understand on the fly. I've seen it mentioned in &quot;The Elements of Typographic Style&quot; and other books on the subject, but it's hard to understand it like that. ;/ <BR> <BR>Also, what about those programs, like HZ-Program now built in InDesign for optical kerning? It calculates something with its formulas. Of course, it would be naive enough to think everybody knows those formulas, but does anyone happen to know the principle? What IS optical kerning? How can a programm be subjective?! O_o <BR> <BR>And the word &quot;arbitrary&quot; doesn't make my day shine. See, such an untrained eye as mine will need million years before it can kern right. -</em>;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>The key to determine how many kern pairs all comes down to the quality of the spacing job on the font. It is likely a perfectly spaced font could exist without any kern pairs.</i>  <BR>  <BR>Great point. That's why I immediatly jumped in and started talking spacing. For example, Alexey, if you look at the list of kerning pairs on pages 89 and 90 of the book you downloaded, the essentials are listed at the bottom of p.89. You probably will have to kern (Av, Ay, Aw, AW etc.) But good spacing might just take care of many on page 90 (for example OB, OD, OE, OF, OH, OI, OK, OL, OM, ON, OP, OR etc, a round next to a vertical, they're all going to be really close to the same) One suggestion might be to group the remaining ones into similar groups for kerning (Av, Ay, Aw will be relatively close) <BR> <BR><i>Regarding rules for kerning, I have a personal theory. . . If you were to determine the absolute horizontal center of a character and draw a line at that mark then set a long string of text, I would kern anything that exceeded a certain width or percentage minding the width of the glyph. </i> <BR> <BR>I also have personal theory, that guides my spacing/kerning :-) For the latin alphabet my experience is that the top half of the lower case has a larger impact on legibility and spacing. For example if you were to type the word l-i-t-t-l-e  or  f-i-t-t-i-n-g  and cover up the top half  a) you'd be hard pressed to read it, and b) the spacing would look really bad! But looking at the letters as a whole, the job might be spaced just right. I guess all that to say, top half of most letters will have the most effect on the spacing/kerning. <BR> <BR>One last thought, it's impossible to incorrectly space two letters. When you add the third, that's when it gets tricky. In your metrics window go down the line in groups of three, then check the line as a whole for overall rythm (for spacing and kerning). <BR> <BR>I am no expert! Expert methods wanted! <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To be fair, there certainly is rhythm during deliberative reading (like looking at a poster).

If I read his part about rhythm with relation to the other glyphs in an alphabet, that's just to say many letters in the roman alphabet have similar shapes, and thus could be spaced/kerned similarly.

Like Yin-Yang. <BR> <BR>Without getting too religious, I'd say that Notan is the entire basis of type design, but it has yet to gain proper respect in the West. You hear people say things like &quot;the black has to be balanced by the white&quot;, but they don't go any deeper than that, towards the implications, like how lettering and type differ, and how chirography cannot generate optimal notan (because the two edges of the black over-ride the truly necessary relationship, the one between the black and the white). And the fact that the term has to be imported from the East is highly telling. <BR> <BR>Notan is the reason spacing is just as important as the letterforms, the reason a font is more than a set of pretty shapes. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Recommended reading: <BR>&quot;Notan: The Dark-Light Principle of Design&quot; <BR>by Dorr Bothwell, Marlys Mayfielf <BR>Only US$8, and it includes DIY exercises. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I just noticed this thread with Kris's quote. <BR> <BR>Sure, more kerning = a bigger font and more data. But frankly, that's not much of an issue on modern computers and with most current-edition software. <BR> <BR>Lots of kerning may result from a designer trying to compensate for poor initial spacing. But even given ideal spacing, a well-made single-byte font may be able to make good use of several thousand kern pairs. <BR> <BR>Although Adobe's earliest fonts in the mid-80s typically had 100-200 kern pairs, by the time Adobe stopped making Type 1 fonts at the end of the 90s, 500-3000 was a fairly normal range of kerning pairs for an Adobe Original design. <BR> <BR>I'll note that the 100-200 count typically involved not kerning accented characters, so it was basically inadequate for most Latin languages beyond English. <BR> <BR>Today, the whole point has become moot for those of us doing OpenType fonts. The character sets may be larger (sometimes vastly larger), which means more kerning is needed. Further, the opportunity to use class-based kerning means that &quot;pairs&quot; and the linear relationship between total kerning and data size become irrelevant. <BR> <BR>If you took the kerning classes in Minion Pro Regular and expanded them into pairs, you'd end up with &gt;70,000 pairs (we did a test at one point in development; the final total would doubtless be larger). But the font also has something like 1600 glyphs. <BR> <BR>We don't generally &quot;boast&quot; about the quantity of kerning in Adobe fonts. It's not something we advertise on our Web site. But I will say that we spend a great deal of time and effort trying to get spacing and kerning right. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T <BR></div>

You must look at the nature of the pairs included. <BR> <BR>A font may have thousands of kern pairs because the base spacing is poor and has been compensated for. For example, does the font have more than about 150-200 lc-lc pairs?  <BR> <BR>Or it may have thousands of pairs because more combinations have been considered and included. Does the font include kerns for accented characters (as Thomas mentioned above) or infrequent combinations? <BR> <BR>A font may have fewer than 500 pairs because the design and the base spacing don't require more.

Code size used to be more of an issue in the early days; less so now. A commercial venture needs to decide how much additional time to spend reviewing pairs of lesser statistical value. A line needs to be drawn somewhere. Different foundries or designers will draw it at different places. <BR> <BR>For example, my Whitman fonts contain on average about 1700 kern pairs.

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, great post. <BR> <BR>What I would say myself is that: <BR>- A font with &quot;too many&quot; pairs is usually better. Somebody who makes his base spacing bad to the point of needing many corrective pairs is unlikely to spend the time putting those pairs in! The habit of looking down upon large numbers of pairs (which de Groot has interestingly called an &quot;Americanism&quot;) might be nothing more than an excuse not to provide good kerning. Gobs of auto-kerning notwithstanding. <BR>- A font with too-few pairs is always bad! Unless it's to make an ideological point by having no pairs at all, like some of Dan Carr's work. <BR> <BR>BTW, don't forget Ypres, an important name in military history&hellip; as well as in Monty Python. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">As we've said, the raw number of kern pairs is no measure of the quality of a font's spacing. Ultimately, the best evidence is to set text and look at it. A well-spaced font will be, well . . . well spaced. <BR> <BR>Generally speaking, though, a truly refined font will have a greater number of pairs. That said, however, a <i>well-crafted</i> font should still set adequately with kerning turned off. Kerning is a refinement of spacing, not a substitute.  <BR> <BR>I'm no expert in the subject of spacing, but I have given considerable thought and study to the matter. Further to the turn this thread has taken, I thought I'd share the following analysis. <BR> <BR>Let me contrast two excellent text typefaces with two that often get used for the task but are, in my opinion, not built for the job. <BR> <BR>Matthew Carter's Miller is one of the most excellent text faces I've had the pleasure to work with over the years. His Fenway is also a contemporary masterpiece for text.  <BR> <BR>In comparison, Mrs Eaves and Filosofia are two typefaces which recently have begun to show up more and more for text in books (heaven forbid). While I admire Zuzana's designs and like both of these in display, I think it is no secret that they are not up to the task of extended text, spacing-wise.  <BR> <BR>I spent a little time a while back sorting some AFM files to gain a little more insight into the inner workings. I broke them down into the following categories: <BR> <BR><b>Uppercase-Uppercase</b> <BR><b>Uppercase-lowercase</b>&ndash; including the odd lc-UC, like <i>cT</i> or <i>cV</i> <BR><b>Uppercase-punctuation</b> &ndash; in either order, e.g., <i>&quot;A</i> and <i>A&quot;</i> <BR><b>lowercase-lowercase</b> <BR><b>lowercase-punctuation</b> &ndash; in either order <BR><b>punctuation-punctuation</b> &ndash; e.g., various points with various quotes, etc. <BR><b>numerals</b> &ndash; involving figures as either element, in combination with anything: other numerals, punctuation, lowercase (e.g., <i>1t, 7t,</i> etc.) <BR><b>accents</b> &ndash; involving any accented character (cap or lc) as one of the elements, including Oslash, Ccedilla, dotlessi, etc. (which aren't accented, strictly speaking) but not the dipthongs <BR> <BR>Here is a breakdown of the number of kern pairs for each.  <BR> <BR><table border=1><tr><td> </TD><TD>Miller</TD><TD>Fenway</TD><TD>Mrs Eaves</TD><TD>Filosofia </TD></TR><TR><TD>UC-UC</TD><TD>122</TD><TD>67</TD><TD>93</TD><TD>85 </TD></TR><TR><TD>UC-lc</TD><TD>200</TD><TD>277</TD><TD>58</TD><TD>78 </TD></TR><TR><TD>UC-punct</TD><TD>285</TD><TD>319</TD><TD>10</TD><TD>26 </TD></TR><TR><TD>lc-lc</TD><TD>156</TD><TD>97</TD><TD>7</TD><TD>5 </TD></TR><TR><TD>lc-punct</TD><TD>245</TD><TD>289</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>0 </TD></TR><TR><TD>numerals</TD><TD>64</TD><TD>129</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0 </TD></TR><TR><TD>accents</TD><TD>33</TD><TD>137</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Total</TD><TD>1128</TD><TD>1359</TD><TD>170</TD><TD>194</td></tr></table> <BR> <BR>It is instructive to look at the particular pairs in all these instances. I can't go into them here, but I recommend all those who wish to learn more about kerning to look closely into the AFM files of several fonts. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K.</div>
