    But you'll have to finish it before november, then the trend changes to something
    else and everybody will go for that instead.\r\n\r\nBut let's say you release
    it no later than 15 october. In that case you will earn some big bucks (in Euros)
    for about two weeks."

    common in several parts of northern Europe. Insiders claim <em>Condemd house</em>
    could very well be next week's big hit.

  body: "FYI: In Europe the \u2018Jingle Envelope\u2019 does NOT exist. In other words:
    Mortgages can not be dissolved by sending the house keys to the bank \u2014 banks
    in Europe are more prudent when loaning to people, thereby protecting those that
    don\u2019t have the means to pay back their debts. Some countries even have special
    guarantee funds to cushion mortgage defaults and so on. \r\n\r\nEven more remarkable
    for Americans may be the fact that Europeans in general don\u2019t like to be
    in hock and prefer to save before purchasing luxury goods. We have a positive
    savings rate (as does Japan). The US has the reverse: a per capita (credit card)
    debt in excess of 20k. Plus a national per capita debt of over 50k because of
    the overspending of its government. \r\n\r\nEurope\u2019s governments are basically
    social-democratic, in the sense that the state provides for at least a few basic
    needs, preventing inhabitants to drop to sub-existence levels. They also have
    national debts that are regulated to be within managable bounds.\r\n\r\nAmericans
    may call this socialism, I like to call it social, because it is anti-social to
    burden the coming generations with financial debt as well as an environment that
    will be damaged beyond repair. I still remember how aghast I was the first time
    I visited the US when I rode the bus from the 42d St Terminal to Newark Airport:
    the desolation and the pollution of the industrial estates I saw was beyond anything
    I had seen before\u2026 (AD 1980).\r\n\r\nBecause the US are a huge factor in
    international trade, the rest of the world has to pay for their foolish ways and
    the excessive avarice of their bankers, businessmen and politicians. Our only
    solace will be that this recession will be shorter for us than for it will be
    for the American people, because we have more financial reserves and the financial
    sector is far less important here. Too bad that people who are completely innocent
    will suffer the most (the poor masses of Africa, Asia and South America).\r\n\r\nI
    am sure the next president will be a lot smarter than the present one \u2014 let\u2019s
    hope he will do a better job (and even that is a no-brainer)\u2026\r\n\r\n . .

  body: "Burt -- \"we\" Americans all get tarred with the same brush. Here is another
    true story about Americans that is just as typical: When my father turned 66,
    he bought a refrigerator on time (i.e., charged it), to see what that felt like.
    He decided he didn't like the feeling & paid it off the next month.\r\n\r\nFrom
    my perspective, it was a western-world-wide change in attitude that started about
    the 1980s that ruined things. I know, every older generation complains about the
    younger ones . . .\r\n\r\nPeople don't take it seriously, but as an observation,
    monarchies seem to do better than democracies. The pattern with a monarchy seems
    to be \"a good one, a bad one, a good one, a bad one . . .\" -- a pattern rarely
    achieved in a democracy. The only trick with a monarchy is to be born during a
    good one."

  body: "Amen brother.\r\n\r\nPeople don't take monarchy seriously because people
    believe what they're told to believe, and politics is subject to fashion just
    like anything else. The denialism concerning the inadequacy of democracy is in
    fact precisely democracy's final \"closure\", fostering a hermetic system where
    people think they're in control of their societies/lives, naturally developing
    an aversion to seeing the fatal flaw: that people are qualified to cook, build
    houses, make fonts, serve food, etc. and not qualified to grasp politics. If one
    wants to grasp politics, one must be trained to be a politician.\r\n\r\nDemocracy
    thus seals the fate of the poor peons who are perpetually voting, expecting improvement,
    because, after all, they're the ones making the choices, big and small. People
    don't like admitting they don't know what they're doing. So what becomes very
    difficult for them to see is that the choices they're given are pre-determined
    to avert true change, to avert true divergence from the hermetic plutocracy they're
    stuck in. Essentially, they get to choose between \"Original\" and \"Mint\" toothpaste.
    In contrast, monarchy is easier to fix because when it's bad there's a groundswell
    of palpable discontent where nobody is being fooled, and this discontent will
    eventually explode in the face of the tyrants. That might sound necessarily bloody
    (which is not always the case) but is a short spurt of violence not preferable
    to interminable servitude? Democracy is the slow death of dignity. And the more
    hermetic a democracy, the more likely that change must -and eventually will- come
    from outside.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, well, to somewhat tie this to the original post, what sells well (i.e.,
    getting elected) isn't often what is best for a task (i.e., running a government).\r\n\r\nWhat
    democracy did solve was the succession wars. Rome wasn't the only country to fall
    prey to these. And certain present governments excepted, democracies do seem to
    generate fewer & shorter wars. You can tell Johnnie Commoner he has to lay down
    his life for the good of the wealthy only so often, and for a shorter length of
    time.\r\n\r\nBut Hobo is a high price to pay for these benefits, as is the font-of-the
    month club attitude amongst graphic designers. Of course, that whine presupposes
    you're a type user rather than a product hawker."
