    would be a better choice, unless you're looking for something less common and
    with an older finish.

    Envoy to Minion?

    common in pre-digital type, but the skeleton is nearly the same. So it's all about
    finish here. Which is better suited for your content?"

    content has to do with Classical (Roman) history, the early imperial period under
    Augustus. A fairly long tract of text. Mind you, this might be just the excuse
    I was looking for to buy MVB Verdigris. ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    too! I censored myself because I thought it might be too wide for you. But it's
    lovely and I can certainly vouch for it, having used it many times. The others
    have the advantage of size-specific cuts, and Minion has many more extras, but
    if those aren't requirements, Verdigris would be my choice.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/get_Font_Image-3_5025.php.png]"

  body: Palatine, I would have guessed you already bought Verdigris and used it extensively,
    after you so warmly recommended it two days ago (/node/21252). I've never used
    it myself, so let me know how it turned out for you!

  body: "Typequake:\r\n\r\nI do own Verdigris. When I first recommended it warmly,
    I did not own it. But I compared its letterforms to other fonts designed for extensive
    text. Its versatility and aesthetic virtues were obvious. After having actually
    used it for two lengthy pieces of work, dealing mainly with Roman classical literature,
    my impressions of the font have been confirmed.\r\n\r\nMy attention was diverted
    by Envoy, however. I found its old-style characterestics rather charming, but
    the comparison to the overly-clean and consequently, insincere Minion, turned
    me away from it. So Verdigris came to mind, etc. "
