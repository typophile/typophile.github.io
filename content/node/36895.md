  body: The use of Dax is a tip of the hat to pattyfab, who in other threads mentioned
    a dislike for Dax. Which is a terrible reason for picking type, unless you're
    a Typophile.

  body: "<strong>The Aftermath</strong>\r\n\r\nThe evening started out quietly enough.
    We slowly assembled at the only round table in the north room, but it quickly
    overflowed. So we moved to a larger assemblage of tables, leaving our little round
    table for a group of pirates. (I tried to engage their leader in hearty pirate-talk
    but I mustn't have had the accent right...all I got was vague eye-rolling.) (And
    further, I didn't espy a jug o rum amongst the group of em, so I don't think they
    were real pirates anyway.)\r\n\r\nAs Linda indicated, 10 people participated and
    at times there were 5 different conversations going! We were loud. And unabashedly
    type-oriented. We drowned out those pirates in the corner, celebrating our own
    Talk-Like-A-Type-Geek evening. There are no photos so you'll have to take my word
    for it.\r\n\r\nFirst (serious) bit of business was to continue the debate about
    picking a name for our group. Our short-list from the previous meeting immediately
    got thrown out and a whole new list was drawn up. Dan Reynolds suggests we adopt
    the venerable \"Typostammtisch\" used by Berlin and Frankfurt. Other suggestions
    include some variation of \"Type Club\" or \"Calgary Typographic Society\". The
    debate still continues and will be a part of our next meeting. Whatever the name,
    we all like the idea of referring to ourselves as \"Typos\".\r\n\r\nShow & Tell
    was hugely successful. Most people brought something typographic to share and
    pass around the table.\r\n\r\nMike Kerr showed us work he has been doing illustrating
    letters. His presentation included painted originals of individual letters, a
    finished piece with assembled words, and his sketchbook showing the evolution
    of many forms. Boisterous conversation changed to ooohs and aaahs. His work can
    be seen on his website.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wronghand.com/mike/mikesite.html\r\n\r\nMostly,
    we were too busily engaged in type-talk to follow any meeting-like formality.
    So we continued our conversations and enjoyed the evening."
