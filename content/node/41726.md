  Garde... Whether you love it or hate it, I need the alternative characters for it!\r\n\r\nSpecifically
  the slanted versions of characters like the 'A' and 'W' etc.\r\n\r\nI have a selection
  of the normal type weights just not the alternative characters.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  can shed some light on how to find them, I would really appreciate it!\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Do a web search for Eisner + Flake, that foundry has Avante Garde Alternatives,
    but the characters aren't drawn the same size as an Adobe Font, so you really
    need their version of Avante Garde or you will have to fake it if you use alternatives
    with Adobe font.
