  to find some evidence to back up my insistence on a ban of the use of cheesy fades/gradients/bevel
  and emboss combinations/80/90s style photoshopping effects on the images being used.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any links or images of tacky graphics?? \r\nAnnual reports / brochures
  / anything of the above to help me illustrate my point?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nEmily"

  body: Look at Nintendo Power magazines from the late 80s to mid 90s, horrible stuff
    I swear. The late 80s, early 90s stuff was just weird drawings and tons of color
    thrown all over. Although there was 1 year they had the magazine really clean,
    I think it was 92 or 93. Then they upgraded to bevel-boss 90s mega grunge photoshop
    filters by 94

    been using cheesy graphics in the past, and you're trying to convince them to
    change their ways?  "
