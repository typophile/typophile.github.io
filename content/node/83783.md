  1959.\r\nPerhaps set in Garamond.\r\n\r\nBut look at the Picture: \r\nLine 1: URW
  Garamond, 44pt and 0,3 extra spacing (gimp)\r\nLine 2: Scan from book\r\nLine 3:
  URW Garamond \u201Ethickened\u201C, 44pt and 0,3 extra spacing (gimp).\r\n\r\nIs
  there a Garamond wich has the appearance of the books one?\r\n\r\nObviously font
  appearence depends on print technology, media, optical size ... seems that simple
  scaling is not enough, or font use is limited to certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut:
  what would be the right appearance for the URW Garamond? Laser print? Inkjet? Offset?\r\n\r\nIs
  this Garamond so thin intentionally or the book's one too fat?\r\n\r\nIrritating.\r\n\r\nKind
  regards,\r\nthe"

  body: Letterpress is one output option you overlooked, and might explain the "fat"
    type in your scanned sample...
