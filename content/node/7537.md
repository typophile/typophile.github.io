body: Why is wood type so popular again? In just a few short months, its everywhere.
  Is it this poker tourney or is Jesse James haunting the typophiles&#39; minds? <BR>Discuss.

  body: It must be a reaction to the cold, mechanical mainstream of contemporary western
    society. Same goes for so called &#34;vernacular&#34; type, where badly crafted
    letters are seen to have charm. <BR> <BR>I think warmth and imperfection can be
    good things, but the way they&#39;re coveted these days seems like an escape,
    not a true valuation of those virtues. People who now cherish wood type still
    can&#39;t live without their chrome gadgets. <BR> <BR>hhp

    the rise in popularity and appreciation for both formal and casual script faces.
    Charm is definitely one aspect, but so is personality. And an attachment to the
    more human component of lettering, perhaps.'

- body: Tayo, do you think it is being used incorrectly? With a poker tournament,
    I think it&#39;s great. With Bam Margera&#39;s MTV show, it doesn&#39;t make any
    sense &#40;that I&#39;m immediately aware of&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#34;Perhaps the single
    most distinguishing factor in the approach of the contemporary designer is his
    willingness to let the problem act upon him freely and without preconceived notions
    of the forms it should take.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;As we become more mature we will
    learn to master the interplay between the past and the present and not be so self-conscious
    of our rejection or acceptance of tradition. We will not make the mistake that
    both rigid modernists and conservatives make, of confusing the quality of form
    with the specific forms themselves.&#34; <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>the preceding are a small sample.. <BR>I agree Brian, poker tourney&#39;s
    are fine, nay, even warrented. I am just curious how EVERYTHING&#42; is now made
    in Tuscans or Egyptians or of woodblocks. Whats next, graffiti scripts? How does
    one keep up with such avant garde trends? &#40;Read: &#34;some kind of sarcastic
    comment&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42;May not include all things in existence currently.'

  body: Stephen.. <BR>That was the point of that image, sorry. Someone mentioned Poker
    as acceptable for woodtype, and I agreed, but I found that image that had nothing
    relevant to it in its typography, even though, that is one of the more famous
    tournaments I know of &#40;I don&#39;t watch much television&#41;. I should have
    labeled my images. <BR>Paul.. <BR>Please refer to the &#42; in EVERYTHING. <BR>But
    on the subject, do you find the use of Beck&#39;s album cover relevant? Do you
    find it relevant that type SHOULD be relevant? Just curious, as I am still in
    school and our school lives and dies for Swiss typography and the International
    Style. Everything must have a purpose...yadayada. I agree with it, but slowly
    I have been suceeding from the rigor of it. For instance, I have forced myself
    to cut Helvetica by 75% because even she can not identify Beck.

  body: to me type is like color. you use color to evoke certain moods and responses.
    you can use type the same way. beck&#39;s odelay album is not totally country,
    but i think you can feel it&#39;s influence. i think that the titling for the
    album art helps convey this visually as beck does in the music on this one sonically.
    <BR>does type have to be relevant? i believe it <i>should</i> be, but does it
    <i>have to</i> be? i don&#39;t think so.
