    The old apple rules\u2014everything simple, set in Myriad\u2014were really targeting
    people who had a taste for clean modernist aesthetics. Breaking out of that box
    is a sign that Jobs is reaching out to the wider customer base that Apple has
    picked up in recent years."

    had to do something to link to that. It would've seemed (non)branded if they'd

    I don't see much wrong with it. I think it's a very approachable logo, that's
    still clean with a strong concept. As Nick pointed out \"Saving to the Cloud\"
    and for years, the Internet was always visualized as a cloud, especially in data
    flow diagrams. It's interesting that Apple took that visual idea and made it more
    \"congruent\" and \"tangible\", instead of this implied empty space that things
    just \"happen\" in. It's now a destination, that seems very welcoming and more
    importantly, safe. Since you'd be relying on it to keep all your important data
    (contact info, calendars schedules, files...) there, secure.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm not sure how I feel about the iPhone icons being used in the cloud to
    represent the various services. I suppose that those are the clearest, most minimal
    visual representations of those various things within the Appleverse. As for the
    Web 2.0 comments/complaints, that's really no different than what Apple's been
    doing for the past decade. My major complaint is that the cloud looks like a collection
    of bubbles and aqua buttons instead of a cloud. It feels kind of amateurish.

  body: "I don't mind this at all. As others have said, it's distinguishing itself
    for a new audience. That audience is those under this category: \"Exchange for
    the rest of us.\" (taken from Apple's own mouth) The \"rest of us\" means people
    who want centralized syncing of their devices but aren't IT professionals and
    just want that convenience at home.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think it's a bit fluffy,
    but it does hit a lot of the right notes, given their goals.\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    the cloud image refers to the centralized server that manages all of this cross-device
    syncing. Apple refers to this as \"the cloud\":\r\n\r\n<em>\"MobileMe stores all
    your email, contacts, and calendars on an online server \u2014 or \u201Ccloud\u201D
    \u2014 and pushes them down to your iPhone, iPod touch, Mac, and PC. When you
    make a change on one device, the cloud updates the others. Push happens automatically,
    instantly, and continuously. You don\u2019t have to wait for it or remember to
    do anything \u2014 such as docking your iPhone and syncing manually \u2014 to
    stay up to date.\"</em>"

    said it best... This is no mistake... They're doing this on purpose, not because
    they are na\xEFve, but because they are going after a certain look for a certain
    \"audience\" or \"target\" (as they say in advertising).\r\n\r\nI have problems
    with design that deliberately dumbs things down, because I think that involves
    a negative value judgement of others (I feel that it is akin to \"talking down\"
    to someone), but maybe other people have problems with design that tries to educate
    or elevate, or that simply tries to be well-made or appropriate (maybe \"good
    taste\" is not always \"right\"). And I know I'm opening a huge can of worms here,
    because how do you define \"well-made\" or \"appropriate\"? No matter how much
    theory and objectivity you can come up with, there is always a human being making
    decisions, be it at the design-decision level or at the money-making level.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    I should give a concrete example. I once designed a book about a professional
    soccer team, and I wanted to print the cover with a matte finish. When the printer
    found out, he said, \"Oh, just make a glossy cover; that's what soccer fans (the
    audience for the book) are going to go for.\" (I should mention that this all
    took place in Argentina, not the U.S., but maybe it is still a valid story.) I
    ended up having my way with the matte finish, and the book sold well -- I don't
    think the cover's finish would make it or break it. But that doesn't prove or
    disprove anything -- it's just one little example, and it bears no comparison
    to something as massive as the iPhone or .mac accounts."

    anyone is consciously trying to be cynical about it. The cynical view is a product
    of the 20th century, which made mainstream culture cynical.\r\n\r\nI was aiming
    to go beyond cynicism. I was sarcastic and satirical with my list of descriptive
    words. At the same time I was 90% neutral&#8212;the words I chose describe the
    logo's qualities, but that doesn't mean I hate it. It just isn't for me.\r\n\r\nThe
    point: Apple are catering to the lowest common demoninator, and that philosophy
    produces awful design. The same kind of philosophy produces awful industrial design
    like the Ford Crown Victoria. It's a bad logo, and anyone who defends it as having
    aesthetic merit is defending bad design and the philosophy of pandering to the
    lowest common demoninator.\r\n\r\nIt could also be said that this badly-designed
    logo reflects Apple's willingness to pollute the world with such banality in pursuit
    of the almighty dollar, which is not so mighty these days. When I called it \"visual
    pollution\", I meant it. It looks like rubbish and it stinks. That last bit really
    is cynical.\r\n\r\nI still think they could have captured their target market
