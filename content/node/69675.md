body: "Maybe someone can help me out with this. It looks like an ornamental version
  of Fournier's Financiere. I have this in metal and I recently ran across a showing
  of it in a pamphlet describing the Haut-Vidalon Paper Mill run by Montgolfier in
  1750. If there are pin marks on the type I have failed to see them.\r\n\r\nP Gallo\r\nThe
