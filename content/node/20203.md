  Simon Morley's \"Writing on the Wall:  word and image in modern art\". \r\n\r\nLots
  of images showing the use of words in art from the late 1800s to the present. \r\n\r\nCan
  anyone recommend other books (apart from the ones on graffiti, with which I am already
  familiar) in the same vein?\r\n\r\nThanks."
