  to receive any response.\r\nmost of there faces are available on Font Shop, however,
  SM Script (which looks like the face used in \r\nelementary school to teach us how
  to make cursive letters) is not available there or anywhere else.\r\n\r\ndoes anyone
  know how to contact Kimera OR where to buy SM Script?\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you"
