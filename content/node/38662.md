  body: Wow this is so lovely! I can't wait to use it for my next logo project because
    it looks like everything you type with it really becomes a logo automatically!
    Does anyone know if it's easy to put the letters and the linework in separate
    colours?

  body: From what I understand about the typeface it is all opentype and all easy
    to work with. However, take Marian's advice and read the EULA.
