  resources in that manner. In particular I'm interested in graphic content: sketches,
  illustrations, photographs. The earlier the better. I plan to visit <a href=http://stbride.org/>St
  Bride Library</a> in the near future, but anything else you'd like to add will be
  much appreciated.\r\n\r\nAn <a href=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/ij/images/incunabl_printrad.lg.jpg>example</a>
