    site</a>, these kits may no longer be sold. I have a bunch of the CAC fonts in
    my Script Font ID Guide, but this apparently isn't one that I have.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "I did a search on 'CAC' with Fontseek and saw one called<a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=cac_pinafore&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=Dadd&nb_ppp=10&psize=m&classt=alpha\">
    'Pinafore' </a>that resembled this at first glance, but it turns out to be more
    of a connected script. \r\n\r\nThe CAC idea might still be right, but my search
    didn't find it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I can't find anything either. I think the font which I was thinking of was
    really Nevison Casual. But that isn't a match. :^( Sorry.
