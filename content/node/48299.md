body: "Hey!  I'm building an artist directory of sorts for my internship and I'm looking
  for a plugin for InDesign that can create a link from a delimited text file to the
  document.  I've messed around with Smart Catalog by woodwing, but it doesn't seem
  to be of much convenience except that it can copy and paste.  Because each page
  is exactly the same in layout (just different text or images plugged in) I'm looking
  for a plugin that can be used on the master page layout to kind of ID the copy so
  at the click of a button it will automatically generate the document/fill it in
  with the proper information.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any suggestions, I've
  already perused this page:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/plugins/indesign/"

  body: The learning curve may be steep, but this sounds like something that could
    be accomplished with some simple scripting.  You might find some assistance [[http://www.adobeforums.com/webx?13@@.3bbf275d|here.]]

    were directories and all I had was an excel file to work with.  '

    Data feature and it was AMAZING!
