body: Hello my name is James leahy and this is one of my first fonts.  I am trying
  to take inspiration for the Russian style of serif type with its sharp corners but
  I wanted to bring this in the san serif style and soften it up a bit in order not
  to look so harsh.  The typeface is unnamed and I haven't started working on the
  spacing yet but I would really like to hear if there is anything wrong with the
  design or opinions about the design and style.

  body: "Hi James,\r\nsome of your characters are rounded, some are made up of straight
    lines with sharp corners; some are skewed, some not.  The proportions and line
    widths of the characters also do not match.  You should stick to a common style
    for your letters.\r\nMy advice is to first draw simple letter forms as a beginner
    before you try to design a typeface with a lot of idiosyncrasies."
