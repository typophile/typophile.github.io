  here and there and am not finding a perfect match.\r\n\r\nKinda like Impact, California
  Grotesk and others... but no match.\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nHere is a link to some more

  body: The only digital version with the square top finial on the C that I know of
    is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.106328.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=CONAN&sampleSize=96">TC
    Europa Bold</a>, and the stems are slightly flared. It's possible this specific
    variant never made it to digital (I hope I'm wrong).

  body: "Even though this is a 'brute force' method, it would be a simple font edit
    to square the upper corner of the C using <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/europa-grotesque-rr/\">Europa
    Grotesque</a> in one of the bolder weights and then manipulate the shape to simulate
    the Conan lettering. This font doesn't have the tapered strokes, at least. (If
    I didn't have to restart my computer to post a graphic, I would demonstrate this.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I take it back -- I just tried it, and the strokes are not uneven enough
    to look right when they are stretched wider.\r\n\r\nNever mind.\r\n\r\n(p.s. I
    looked in some old film type books, and didn't see this style of Grotesk. TC Europa
    is the closest I saw too.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
