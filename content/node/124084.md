  body: "Commercial embroidery of clothing has been done since long before other digital
    computer fonts. \r\nScript styles that were developed independently of computer
    fonts. \r\nSee for example a font often called Embroidery Athletic Flair or [img:sites/default/files/old-images/EmbroideryAthleticFlair@80pct_6188.jpg]
    which looks similar to the Harvard embroidery script except for the _H_, _M_ and
    _o_.\r\nVariations such as Automotive Workwear Sport Script have the same _o_
    as the Harvard letters. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/EmbroideryAutomotiveWorkwearSportScript_3547.jpg]\r\nThere
    is probably a variation for medical uniforms.\r\nModern embroidery  machines can
    also use conventional retail fonts converted to a format usable by the machine.\r\nDon"

    Script http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Monoline+Script&q=Go or Monotype Script
    http://www.identifont.com/find?font=monotype+script&q=Go\r\nIn both cases you
