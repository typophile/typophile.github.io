  was comprising an e instead of a c. The copy read \"2005 (e)\". What does this mean?
  Edition? year? "

  body: I've seen it used as "edition" in the past, but I've not been able to find
    a cite for it in "the usual suspects" (Chicago, GPO, Words into Type, APA, AMA,
    MLA, AP, CP, NYT, NYPL, Gregg, EAC, G&M).

    in mL.\r\n\r\nI see in the unicode naming when I open a font in Fontlab that it
    is called 'estimated.' \r\n\r\nI guess it means estimated weight? But why do they
    always look exactly the same??\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/estimated_5658.png]"

  body: Nah, the character I saw was a lowercase e (maybe 18 pts high in Frutiger
    75), with a 1 pt vector circle drawn around it. I assumed the typographer was
    trying to emulate some existing symbol, and this was the ony way he/she could
    think to do it.

  body: During the dotcom boom IBM ran marketing campaigns using <strong>@</strong>
    with an e inside the circle. It could be some variant.

    a relatively obscure and now unused \"edition\" mark.\r\n\r\nThe stylized and
    really huge graphic that JLM posted is an \"equivalent measure\" mark, and certified
    by ISO."

    to ad hominem attacks, and have used 4 letter words with asterisks instead of
    vowels. Are you related to Muzzer?
