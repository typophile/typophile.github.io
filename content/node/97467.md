body: It's hard for me to imagine someone only creating one typeface and no more.  It
  would be like someone only painting one painting, or someone writing only one song.  To
  gather enough passion for something to do it completely and in whole once, but at
  the same time not enough passion to want to even do it one more time before you
  die, seems like a hard spot to land on.

    one kick at the can, but even that was a rarity.\r\n\r\nMax Miedinger worked for
    30 years as a graphic designer and typographer before he joined Haas."

  body: "From the title, I thought this thread was about something like like the \"one
    hit wonder\" in popular music; a type designer who, unlike Frederic W. Goudy,
    Morris Fuller Benton,  or Hermann Zapf, only designed one <em>successful</em>
    face that anyone remembers.\r\n\r\nMany amateur designers might well just make
    one font and decide it's just too much work."

    know he did Montaigne but as far as I know that was only used for one or two in-house
    jobs (in one point size) and was never made generally available..."

  body: "Yes, typecasting!  :-)\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to something I've been wanting
    to do for a while: would it be possible/useful to make a list of type designers
    showing what they're best at and/or best known for*? For example Alejandro Paul
    would have \"script fonts\", James Montalbano might get \"highway signage\", Gerry
    Leonidas and Maxim Zhukov would obviously get \"Greek\" and \"Cyrillic\" respectively,
    etc. Although there's a risk of pigeon-holing it would also be useful to direct
    people to specialists. Maybe?\r\n\r\n* No snide remarks about yours truly please.
