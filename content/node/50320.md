body: "I feel guilty for asking (because I am a strong advocate of buying typefaces
  and supporting local foundries) however, with that being said... I need to use Helvetica
  Rounded Bold for a school project. I would purchase the typeface if I ever intended
  on using it again, but I don't really like the face..... So if anyone has a copy
  and wouldn't mind sharing for educational purposes it would be greatly appreciated.

  body: Your best bet is to purchase it. Even if you don't plan on using it ever again.
    It's only $29.00 to purchase a legit license - that's really not that expensive.
    But if even that meager sum is beyond your means, you can try sweet-talking the
    license holders... Or you could trace the glyph shapes in an illustration program
    and use the traced shapes to typeset what you need...of course with how much time
    it would take to do that, you might as well have earned up the money to buy a
    license.

    if you need something and similar is tolerable, Arial Rounded is a system font
    on most macs now. I'd suggest using that. "

  body: Helvetica Rounded was in the Font Folio OCAD required GD and AD students to
    purchase (or at least was when I went to OCAD) so you can probably find it installed
    on one of the computers on the 6th floor. If not, ask someone at the service bureau.
