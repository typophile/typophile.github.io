  body: "i quite like this font.\r\n\r\ndear bruno, \r\n\r\nmay i ask you some questions?
    (just out of curiosity..)\r\n\r\n- on your site we see the reworked logo of MIGROS.
    what was your part in the redesign of their identity? are you happy with the rounded
    characters? was a whole charset create (as a private work, just to learn something,
    i'd maybe try to do this.. but if it already exists, im not sure if i will)\r\n\r\n-
    you designed the new \"kiosk\"-typeface, right? what was the briefing there? as
    a normal customer (with high affinity to design and type design) i must say that
    i dont really like the whole identity (i love parts of it, but i think its too
    round, too \"unsharp\") - again, what was your part in this work?\r\n\r\nif you
    have time to answer these two questions, i'd be very happy. im aware of the fact
    that you surely have to do lots of other things, so if not, a short note would
    be appreciated, too.\r\n\r\nthierry blancpain (from switzerland, too, by the way)\r\n\r\nPS:
    just as another information, im doing my first try at a \"real\" display-font,
    and the rounded details in the m\xF6venpick-logo inspired me. thanks!"

    body: "Thierry,\r\n\r\nsorry for not responding earlier.\r\n\r\n- Migros. We worked
      on the logo development, commissioned by Wirz Identity in Zurich. Although there
      was once talk about designing a whole typeface it never came off. I am happy
      with the logo lettering in as far as the crafting is concerned. I believe though
      that Migros could have been a little braver and departed more radically from
      the old identity. But as you know, Migros is a cooperative society set up, so
      too many people and committees became involved.\r\n\r\n- Kiosk. No, we only
      refined the logo. We had nothing to do withthe typeface. \r\n\r\nHope this helps.
      And sorry again for the delay in answering.\r\nBruno Maag\r\nDalton Maag Ltd"

  body: the parts that are shown of the modified interface (altough i gotta admit
    that i dont really know interface that well, so i dont know how much modifiying
    was done). i wanted to say at least a bit about the thread itself (ontopic), because
    the rest is, in fact, all "offtopic".
