body: "Frank Holme (1868 - 1904) was an illustrator working in Chicago, Illinois.
  In 1898 he started a school of illustration and hired J. C. Leyendecker, foremost
  illustrator of the day, as a faculty member. In October of that year he hired F.
  X. Leyendecker, also an illustrator, William Carqueville, an illustrator and printer,
  and [[F. W. Goudy]] as faculty. Goudy taught a course in lettering and his students
  included [[William Addison Dwiggins]] and [[Oswald Cooper]]. The school was housed
  in the Fine Arts Building on Michigan Ave., formerly the Studebaker Building.\r\n\r\nBy
  the next year the school had twelve faculty including W. W. Denslow, best known
  for illustrating the first edition of the Wizard of Oz, and J. T. McCutcheon, another
  popular illustrator of the day. Holme eventually closed the school due to health
  reasons and bankruptcy, and moved to Arizona. He died in 1904 in Colorado. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
