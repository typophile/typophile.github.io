  about fonts that you think have really <cite>nice </cite>looking numbers 1 and 9,
  that will work well together (the rest of the font can be kaka :o) ). I want something
  a little - uh, fluid. And old style. \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    I just need more coffee, but that seems like not an awful lot of information.\r\nHave
    a look around <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100018\">Numbers</a>?"

  body: What do you mean by old style here? Like a Goudy text face? I don't think
    of those as fluid so much as sometimes a bit blobby. Maybe you mean old fashioned
    and caligraphically fluid... Or something else. More definition please. Have you
    looked at Dutch mannerist writing?

    again, hey - why not?). Oldstlye as in non-lining figures. Those aren't rules

    </cite>calligraphy, but I draw well, and by drawing the same glyphs over and over
    again, I can end up with something LIKE calligraphy. :o) In the end, what ever
    I do will be hand drawn, though likely based on or at least, \"inspired\" by an
    existing font, though I've been looking at Bickman's Universal Penman. The carved
    shapes need to be fatter than most calligraphic figures I've seen. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
