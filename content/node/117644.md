  I have handy for the appearance of that face.\r\n\r\nNote that the x-height is not
  extravagantly large, but the descenders are very small. A nice-looking face; originally
  I had mistaken it for a wider version of Century Expanded."

    match for Century while they are totally different in Excelsior.\r\n"

    are wrong for Excelsior but are closer to Century 731 BT , available since 1929

  body: "Thank you! I've compared it to Century 731, and it does look very close.
    There were different versions of Excelsior to which I compared it originally,
    and some had numerals that did seem to me to match, which is a reason I chose
    Excelsior over other members of the Legibility series.\r\n\r\nBut Century 731
    is wider than Century Expanded, so my next question was, what is Century 731 really?
    So I did some Googling.\r\n\r\nParaType told me the face was part of the Legibility
    series, and originally designed by Chauncey Griffith.\r\n\r\nAnd then Identifont
    yielded the secret: Century 731 is Bitstream's version of Textype. (Chauncey H.
    Griffith, 1929.) So I'm going to check out the original, since Mechanix Illustrated
    was done on Linotype hot metal equipment, after all, which would account for small
    discrepancies from Bitstream's digitization.\r\n\r\nWell, I managed to hunt down
    at least one image that included a specimen of the original Textype; here's a
    piece taken from that image:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/textype_5128.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    here's some more Textype, with a lot of digits:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/textype_digits_5627.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    second sample, though, seems to have a smaller x-height than the first, as well
    as being a better match. However, I did come across a source that mentioned that
    there was a \"book\" version of Textype as well as the \"newspaper\" version of
    it, so I could well have encountered both in that case."

    often seen, I had never heard of (by name).\r\n\r\nI saw it turn up, after this
    thread, in a Google search on an unrelated topic:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/norden_4761.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    instructions World War II pilots had with them on how to use the Norden bombsight!"
