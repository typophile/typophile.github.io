body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am going to see a client in London next week to discuss
  their use of the Frutiger typeface.  They contacted me a few weeks ago asking for
  some help in standardising their versions.  Now, I do not have any idea what version
  of the font they are using, but I want to prepare myself properly for the meeting
  and show to them that I actually have some idea of what is going on!\r\n\r\nNow,
  as I understand it, the original Frutiger typeface is owned by Linotype, but other
  font foundry's have also created the 14 weight family. i.e. Monotype (Frutiger MT)
  and Bitstream (Humanist 777). Please correct me if this is inaccurate.\r\n\r\nThe
  main reason that they want to meet with me is that their marketing, design, and
  print departments seem to be using conflicting versions of the font, and they want
  to standardise on one version so that their brand is consistent.\r\n\r\nI am going
  to ask the respective font foundry's for some sample settings to take to the client,
  but is there any other information, i.e. good/bad points about all three that should
  be considered.  I know that most of you will say to me that the original Frutiger
  should be used, and I agree with this, but I would like to give the client some
  options and a bit of history.\r\n\r\nLook forward to any responses.\r\n\r\nKind
  regards\r\nNeil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Please factor into your discussion that Adrian Frutiger re-drew his homonymous
    font with true italic characters and optically adjusted weights a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThis
    \"new\" family was released in 2000 and is known as Frutiger Next.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'I agree with John, unless they''re in-love with the original oblique italics,
    suggesting they standardize on Frutiger Next might be the way to go. If they want
    to modernize the look I''d disuade them from using Myriad (as it''s a bit over-used)
    and maybe suggest they look at Luc''s Corpid. '

  body: Also check out Segoe, Microsoft's <em>homage</em> to the Frutiger typeface
    -- your client will probably be running it on their PCs internally, so that should
    be figured in to the mix.

  body: "If they're OpenType it <em>shouldn't</em> be an issue, which brings me to
    this question...\r\n\r\nSii, what's up with Microsoft taking so long with OpenType
    compatibility? I had all my Office programs crap out on me after installing the
    Linotype Originals (OT) library on my computer. Had to have an IT guy come straighten
    it out. I would think Microsoft as a partner on OT would be actively integrating
    it into their software. Whazzup wit dat?"

  body: "Should have been clearer - copying them from Windows to the Mac would break
    the EULA. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve not heard of the problem described with either Office
    on the Mac or Windows. The Windows Vista text services devs and testers have access
    to many Linotype OTF\u2019s (especially the slightly quirky mega-families) under
    license and I don\u2019t recall any reported problems. \r\n\r\nAnyway I\u2019ll
    check with the Linotype folks - I\u2019m sure if this is a common occurrence they\u2019ll
    have the details.\r\n"

    you know if Segoe, Segoe WP specifically, can be licensed to a non-Microsoft affiliated
    company who wants to use it as their new corporate house font? I'd imagine not
    and I haven't found a place where one can buy it off the shelf to use however
    they please, either."
