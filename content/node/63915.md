  graphics and i'm about to start a project which only allows me to use the font which
  is known as Lexia.\r\n\r\nI'm having a problem finding much history on it, can any
  one help? Links to sites or any good books that might help.\r\nLooking forward to
  hearing from...any one really.\r\n\r\nThanks"
