body: "I'm working on a logo for a high end bike shop in a fairly upscale neighborhood.
  \ The owner and employees are very young and open minded so I've been trying to
  reach a compromise in the design.  The logo will be used for business cards and
  shop signs as well as for shop clothing which will include jerseys, T-shirts, etc.
  \ \r\n\r\nI went with clarendon bold for the type and used an image of three links
  of a bike chain attached at the middle.  The name \"Lamorinda\" is an abbreviation
  of three towns, Lafayette, Moraga, and Orinda, the shop is located in the middle
  of all three and hence the image of three links of chain.\r\n\r\nAny feedback would
  be greatly appreciated.  Not sure if the Clarendon is too stern? Also, I've been
  having difficulty breaking up the text.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPatrick"

    if you took your top direction, joined the links at the ends to make a traingle
    and substituted that for the A. I'm not reading the mark as the O in the first
    choice.\r\n\r\nAlso, what's the origin of the name? Might try some types with
    national blood if it works that way."

    Just saying. You're sending long-standing cultural "cheap" signals when you're
    supposed to be "upscale" and "high end."

      an impossible construction -- couldn't be made with bike chain. Could you substitute
      with a derivation of a spoked wheel, crank (as jupiter suggests) or sprocket?\r\n\r\nWhat
      sort of bikes are being sold?"

  body: "I think Clarendon works, but the shape doesn't seem very bike chain-like
    to me, either. Perhaps if there were 3 links linked into a triangle that sat in
    the red circle?\r\n\r\nLayouts 1\u20133 are superior to 4 and 5."

  body: 'I personally wouldn''t go all caps. It will restrict how big you can use
    it on jerseys and T shirts. The graphic is boring. Cycling is about speed, distance
    and location. Who cares about a crank spider? Use a more generic graphic like
    a spinning wheel or something enviromental like a local mountain or location.
    You might even make multi graphics with different graphics representing different
    locations in your geographical area. '

  body: "Thanks for all the good input.  I've been working on a number of ideas which
    I will post and it would be good to hear more feedback.\r\n\r\nI tried the triangle
    chain symbol which worked ok but I think I need to thin out the links to make
    it more effective, bad contrast.  I also got rid of the previous chain symbol,
    it started to look like a propeller to me.  \r\n\r\nReplaced the O with the symbol
    in it with a chain in the shape of the O.\r\n\r\nAlso, experimented with breaking
    up the lettering in an attempt to liven up the type, I think it is a little to
    conservative for the shop. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/lamorinda2.jpg]"

    any size smaller they''d just be a mess of colors. Not saying that you should
    make them bigger though, they just don''t work..nor does the type in either.'

    working on for a team sponsored by the shop I'm designing for.  The safety orange
    color is a request from the title sponsor and the circle patterns are side cuts
    from a tree trunk. The image is a bit big so scroll to the right to see all the
