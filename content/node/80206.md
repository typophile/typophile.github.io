body: "The fonts used in this fabulous-looking book are identified as: RomanT and
  RomanSque. The designer identifies them as \"constructed\" fonts that were chosen
  because of their imperfections and architectural look. I've searched for them online
  but came up with nothing. Anyone familiar with these fonts? Are they proprietary?
  I'm attaching 2 screen shots of the book. \r\n\r\nThanks!"
