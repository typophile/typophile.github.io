  and english programs, how would I go about doing it?\r\n\r\nI don't mind buying
  greek fonts. It is more about how to set them efficently.\r\n\r\nWould anyone know
  where to start?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRobert"

  body: "Are you wanting to set polytonic or monotonic Greek text? If polytonic, you
    have fewer font options, although you can expect this to improve in future: type
    companies are gradually realising that the demand for polytonic Greek types is
    still very much there, and even increasing, despite the fact that the official
    orthography in Greece has been monotonic since 1982.\r\n\r\nI recommend Adobes
    Garamond Premiere Pro as your best first investment.\r\n\r\nEarly next year, the
    Society of Biblical Literature will be releasing SBL Greek as a free download
    from their Font Foundation website."
