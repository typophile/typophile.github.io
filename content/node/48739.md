  body: I think it has some potential, but I would take a big breath and maybe reconsider
    the direction you're going with parts of it. For starters, it seems to reference
    pointed pen script ( I was going to say copperplate, but afraid the terminology
    may be confusing). Many letters seem too devoid of this reference and, I think,
    weaken the overall look. Also...even with a lot of randomness going on with swashy
    forms, I would pay closer attention to how they interact with each other. You
    might want to close up that word spacing a tad while you're at it.

  body: 'Thanks Stephen, yes it initially started life with a pen and paper and almost
    filled an entire sketchbook with designs. I was aiming for something between copperplate
    and handwriting, but I am no craftsman when it comes to pen lettering. It''s by
    far finished but I wanted to see what peoples thought so far. '

  body: "It looks really great from far. \r\nI realize that this is meant to be read
    from a reasonable distance but when I get close, I see a lot of inconsistancies
    with the fine ends on the curves. This is all concerning Penmanship. The actual
    design of the typeface from a distance is very nice. \r\n\r\nAnother thing that
    I noticed is that the top of the lowercase 'z'  is very straight and horizontal
    which doesn't fit the handmade look of the other characters. \r\n\r\nThe swashes
    have a lot of personality which is very nice. "

  body: "Thanks, I am as I said NO penman at all. \r\n\r\nAt the minute it doesn't
    seem to be reading at all, damn kerning has gone to plaid! For what reason I can't
    fathom.\r\n\r\nThere are several alternates swash characters for the t, y and
    z.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback, I appreciate that."

    I'd love to hear your opinions. It's very different from the original. I'm not
    fond of the f, or the v, but it's still in it's infancy yet.\r\n\r\nThanks Andy"

  body: Hi Weeman. I am no gig but I like the calligraphic style of it. I think would
    produce beautiful text. How about that ?
