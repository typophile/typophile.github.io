  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have narrowed down from 4 concepts to this layout for my Book Design class. The book in a nutshell is about a man and woman who have an affair in the 60&rsquo;s, which ends up producing a &ldquo;flower child&rdquo; daughter. The girl grows up without any contact with her father until she randomly runs into him on the train while going to work, he&rsquo;s in pretty bad shape and the first thing she notices is the plaid raggedy jacket he&rsquo;s wearing. The father is always thinking about his past and the mother is always looking into the future, they&rsquo;re both ignoring the consequence of their encounter and as such the daughter is spinning out of control.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t due for another 10 days, but since I have the layout pretty much nailed, it&rsquo;s all about the details. My choice of typeface: Egyptian 505 is to make another connection besides the flower to the 60s where this whole story began. The one question I have is about how to space the letters in the title on the cover as each line is a different point size to accomodate the justification. Right now I think MAN is too loose and I&rsquo;ll need to upsize it a few points and tighten the spacing. I&rsquo;ve run PDF optimizer on it as to facilitate a less bulky download.</p>
<p>Thoughts on this layout?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>While I like the concept &amp; design I&rsquo;m not getting much of a 60s feel, the shoes look pretty contemporary to me. Maybe something groovier? Or a brighter background color?</p>
<p>A few brief comments - the type on the spine doesn&rsquo;t look centered.</p>
<p>Can you eliminate the shoelace? I&rsquo;m not loving where it hits the N.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s leg on the back is a little too subtle - I&rsquo;d taper it a bit more so it doesn&rsquo;t look like a mistake - it&rsquo;s a nice idea. Maybe you don&rsquo;t need a full line break between the paragraphs.</p>
<p>The word spacing inside the leg is a bit dodgy - 2nd para 2nd line is way tight. I&rsquo;d try to avoid hyphenation if you can (mod-ern in the 3rd para)</p>
<p>I think the author&rsquo;s name should get more emphasis than &ldquo;A Novel by&rdquo; also by shouldn&rsquo;t be capitalized.</p>
<p>Finally - I like the rose but will it read when the cover is folded around an entire book? Have  you looked at that? I&rsquo;m not sure a rose reads 60s either, maybe a daisy?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The cleaver womans leg shape on the back cover doesn&rsquo;t work. It looks like a mistake and the third paragagraph of type has horrible rivers running through it. Try for once thinking like an average person buying a book. They are not designers and the visual pun will sail over their heads. You are trying to sell the book, don&rsquo;t play with the copy like that. I agree loose the rose and go daisy. Also if the author is important I&rsquo;d make his name prominate, the author can sell books. Steven Kings name would never be small. Did you look at stroking the type on the title. It seems weak. If it were in a display stand could you read it at 5 or 10 feet, I doubt it. You have a nice design, for design sake but it falls short of what a book seller would want - Sales! Think marketing, think about your target audience</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Patty: I always appreciate your ideas, and you do work with books for a career if I remember right so your point of view is important! I forgot to mention, the origin of the story is in the 60s but it takes place in present day, so I wanted to reference the 60s a bit but not go totally 1960 in the look.</p>
<p>I had actually removed the tongue of the boot and then put it back in, couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind. I&rsquo;ve also been going back and forth about the woman&rsquo;s leg, I didn&rsquo;t mention it in the first post, hoping to get straight up opinions about if it was too subtle. I&rsquo;m thinking of just ditching the idea, but keeping the copy there with the same general column width and just left justifying it. Still tweaking colors etc and was thinking the same about the background color.</p>
<p>Againk, thank you for your insight.</p>
<p>Dan: The author isn&rsquo;t really all that prominent, but good point. I went to a few book stores and checked out displays and book design to get an idea about how this aspect of the industry works. If it was a prominent author I would definitely agree!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have to admit I didn&rsquo;t see the woman&rsquo;s leg at all, I was more struck by an out of balance shape on the back cover, to avoid the need for a hyphenated blurb you could perhaps use the lefthand margin of the text to outline the edge of the leg, although that might be even more subtle. However, the Patty Hearst line is really too cramped, you might need to massage the measure a bit. On the cover type I find the plaid distracting where the highlight stops just below BACK, bumping it up to include the start of the highlight in the first line might help, moving it might also give the opportunity to put a little bit of contrast in the lefthand serif of the A in WARD. As you have ligated the ARD I think the MAN could also be that tight. The inter-line spaces on the title need to appear equal. The alignment on the front cover type, I can see you have aligned the verticals of the lettering, however, because of the fairly heavy serifs and the tightness to the spine a ragged gap will be obvious. A little bit of kerning on the spine would be good. On the front the author&rsquo;s name is floating a bit.</p>
