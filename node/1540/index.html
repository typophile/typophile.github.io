<div class=commentbody>I think like everyone else I started out liking Verdana at 10px. Then like everyone else again, I became quite partial to Georgia with its cute numerals. And yes, I've been through a Trebuchet phase as well. I like those little bends as well. <br> <br>There are only so many screen fonts to choose from, you're bound to end up trying them all. Or most. <br> <br>I wish they would come up with more screen fonts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>IMHO Verdana 11px is the best screen font that's readable without looking clunky. Verdana 13px has a slightly more open spacing than 12px. If you want to use 12px, Verdana Bold is better looking. <br> <br>But you know what, I still think Geneva 12px is really the best... with Chicago 12px as its bold. <br> <br>I don't really care for serifs for screen use, but New York is probably the most readable. Gergia at 12px is a bit too tight. <br> <br>And of course Underware's Unibody, at 8px! Especially the upright italic! <br> <br>The Quartz business in OS X is driving my nuts. If you don't anti-aliase (everything above 12 gets anti-aliased anyway), the spacing is all screwed up. Do you know of any shareware extensions that would correct this? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>You know on the Mac, I like to define verdana at 10.5px. I think it's the perfect size. Unfortunately, on a PC, it becomes 11px which is too big for me. <br> <br>And yes unibody is oh-so-sweet. And it's so nice of them to give it away. <br> <br>I don't know what you mean by the Quartz business but the anti-aliasing <i>is</i> driving me LOONY. Everything is so fuzzy wuzzy. And that is the least of the OSX suite of problems. <br> <br>I can't find anything. There is no manual. And I as if my dear old Mac has been possessed by a PC!

<div class=commentbody>> How do you render half a pixel? <br> <br>1) In grayscale rendering you have fractional pixels. <br>2) In Windows the native OS resolution is 96 ppi, so some half-pixel sizes will have their own bitmaps. Specifically, 10 point rounds to 13 PPEM, 11 point to 15 PPEM, and 10.5 point to 14 PPEM. Since 96/72 is 4/3, one out of every three half-pixel sizes will have its own bitmap. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>When a resolution is different than 72dpi (like in Windows) it's clearer to talk about PPEM: "points per em", which is the number of pixels from top to bottom. At 96dpi for example, a "12 point" font is 16 pixels high. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>ah...but we're not talking about points at all...just pixels. <br> <br>I'm confused as to how a font spec'ed at 10.5 would render since the pixel is pretty much the smallest unit available on the screen (with the noted exception of sub-pixel rendering things like clear-type which aren't really applicable in this case)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant - in what I assume was a slip, you wrote that PPEM is "points per em", which makes no sense because a 14 point font will always be 14 points per em, by definition. Of course ppem = pixels per em. TrueType font technicians use this pixel measurement all the time, and don't think in real-world units such as points or millimetres. When an application requests a particular point size (and implicitly also a zoom & resolution specification), the font returned is mapped to the closest ppem size. <br> <br>If you want to examine the actual pixel-tuned ppem sizes in fonts, a nice trick in MS Word is to set the zoom to 75%. Since 72 is 75% of 96, the point size setting will now exactly equal the ppem setting. Set some lines in consecutive point sizes, and you'll see how the font behaves at all low resolutions. Use Ctrl-[ and Ctrl-] to whizz up & down sizes in selected text.</div>
