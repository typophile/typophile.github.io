body: "Hi! I've been searching for about an hour to find this typeface, and with no
  luck. It comes very close to typefaces like Adelle, but not quite right. The serif
  on the C, G, and S are circular instead of slabbed, which throws the trail off.
  The best example of it that I found is off of the Awesome Blackpool Web Design site.
  Any help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :]\r\n-Valerie"
