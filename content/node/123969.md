  body: "I concur with Don about it being probably custom(ised).\r\nAlso, the roundness
    could be just a byproduct of reproduction method.\r\nThe overall construction
    (especially  |6| and |9|) reminds me of geometric typefaces like Futura and its
    kin (Avenir, Century Gothic, etc.). The hardest characteristic to match seems
    to be the wide-top |4|."

    knowing enough on clock dials manufacturing, I was just wondering how much carving
    tools and paint could be responsible for the roundness.\r\nCompare:\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ressence-round_3716.jpg]\r\n\r\nThat
    said, these numbers sure look rounded! :)"
