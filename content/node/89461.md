body: "Hello everyone, I need font suggestions for a logo :\r\n\r\nI'm looking for
  something simple but chic. I need the letters like As and Vs to be pointy not rounded
  if that makes sense.\r\nI want something feminine and soft but not too much \"decoration\",
  really sober. Its for a clothing line so it can have a little bit of a fashion reference
  but Im trying to go away from Didot and such. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nPlease excuse
  my english I'm french."
