body: "I was wondering if any San Francisco locals could suggest some good graphic
  design studios in SF.\_\r\n\r\nI have done extensive research on the web, books
  and through the AIGA, put a list together, then thought it may be worth asking the
  San Francisco Typophiles as well.\r\n\r\nMy list so far\_includes SF standards like:
  Cahan, Chen, Character, Howry, Paper Plane, Tolleson, Stone Yamashita, Volume,\_UDN,
  Pentagram, Wolf Olins and Landor.\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated.\r\n"

  body: I checked out MINE's site, looked at the first item in their portfolio, ID
    for Brainfloss, liked their "cheaky" logo for it, but no link to the Brainfloss
    site. I went there nonetheless, and there's no logo, just brainfloss.com in lower
    case Helvetica --- Aaaaargh!
