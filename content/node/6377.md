  body: All pretty nice, but with &#34;Like in, historic art, culture, that stuff.&#34;
    I was hoping to see some local art. Hawaiian typedesigners&#39; stuff, maybe even
    good Hawaiian fonts with their special accents. <BR> <BR>As fond as I may be of
    the Tiki Room places, that&#39;s not exactly what I was looking for, but I may
    buy those anyway &#40;THANKS!&#41; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
