  body: No, no. Stephen. You got there fair and square. You even linked to a sample.
    Go ahead. You post one. <BR> <BR>Besides, I&#39;m wasting a client&#39;s bandwidth
    right now. I need to pack up and go home. I wouldn&#39;t be able to get something
    together for several hours at least. You should go ahead and keep the game going.
    Really, I insist. <BR> <BR>-- K.

    is it. Come on, guys, don&#39;t make me actually do my work-work this afternoon...!

  body: 'I think the core of this challenge is that it&#39;s a roman face with an
    angled broken vertical stroke of the dollar sign. There are plenty of fonts with
    a broken stroke on the $, but in all the italics I&#39;ve looked at, the upper
    curve is to the right of the tail, as opposed to directly above like the sample
    here. So it must be a one-of-a-kind design -- I just can&#39;t figure out which
    one. <BR> <BR>So, a plea for a hint: is it available on MyFonts, Stewf?'
