  Typo recently designed the corporate identity of the largest women-organisation
  in The Netherlands; Vrouwen van Nu. An important part of the design is the custom-made
  typeface 'Caren', a font which we created especially for 'Vrouwen van Nu'.\r\n\r\nCaren
  is a remarkable and playful font, which gives the organization a fresh and modern
  look and feel. The typeface is a happy mixture between uni-, upper-, and lowercase
  principals. It is an invitation for all designers and non-designers to play around
  with text and design. \r\n\r\nMore info: http://novotypo.nl/index.html\r\n"
