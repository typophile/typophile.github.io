  forms first first started appearing. I'm not talking about fat faces with wide verticals
  like 'Blackoak', but forms in the same area as the P in the Pirelli logo.\r\n\r\nI've
  noticed a few faces of late on things like Ralph Lauren polos, F2 racing branding,
  and a private aircraft maker - Icon A5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo is this a very recent
  style?\r\n\r\nIt seems to be useful for high performance cutting edge technology
  - prototype cars, planes and sailing.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nG"
