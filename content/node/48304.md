body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\n I am new to this forum and I have to mention I do
  not have real knowledge in typography.\r\n\r\n I became very interested recently
  in learning about font rendering on screen (LCD) and I have been trying to find
  out if there is any method (besides Cleartype) of displaying crisp and good looking
  fonts on the LCD screens. One aspect that I dislike is the fuzzy appearance of fonts
  that can be seen for instance even in Acrobat products. \r\n\r\n Problem: I am trying
  to find a way to get fonts to display as sharp as possible on an LCD screen.\r\n
  \         \r\nQuestion: As I have no experience in this field I would like to get
  some feedback and expert advice on whether the approach I am using now is worth
  pursuing.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T_2_All_4488.PNG]\r\n\r\nThe
  Above Image shows a piece of text (Pdf File)rendered using:\r\n\r\n1) Ghostscript
  (antialiased)\r\n2) Ghostscript (antialiased) + modifications: method 1\r\n3) Ghostscript
  (antialiased) + modifications: method 2\r\n4) Adobe Acrobat reader 9\r\n\r\nI am
  aware that the modified versions 2, 3 have some major problems (on some LCD screens
  there might be some serious color fringes). \r\n\r\nNevertheless I would like to
  get some expert advice on whether the approach 2 or 3 have any chance at improving
  text appearance or readability. The goal here was to get the text look more crisp
  (like you  see it in print), eliminate unequal widths of font stems and gray shadows
  for stems. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 2 seems too faint for easy reading, and 3 is too purple. 4 seems clear and
    well-formed to me. The aliasing in 1 seems a bit random on some of the caps, the
    two 1's in 1981, the h and u in Thus, etc.

    (or possible vice-versa) with no sub-pixel or grayscale rendering, using the display's
    native resolution. <STRONG>Everything</STRONG> else will produced less sharp type.

  body: "Thank you for your comments. \r\n\r\nI agree with you Pdxuser. I cannot correct
    right now the purple on 3), but I tried to make 2)  a little bit darker (see the
    2b, 2c versions). \r\nI also think that Adobe reader has so far the best display
    although it is still far from what I would like.  In any case my problem is that
    I am stuck with ghostscript output (1)  which I am trying to modify to get a crisper
    font look.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments Sii; What I am trying to do is to reduce
    the font width as much as possible while still retaining font appearance. \r\n\r\nI
    loaded 2 new image2 for method 2 - darker versions (2b, 2c)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T_2_All_3b_6142.PNG]"

    Appearance\" and \"sharpness\" are pretty much opposite ends of a sliding scale.
    Assume you're looking for something that's closer to the sharpness end of the
    scale?\r\n "

  body: "Yes, I want to obtain sharp fonts. More exactly: starting with fonts rendered
    using standard grayscale antialiasing methods (as for CTR monitors) I want to
    apply subpixel rendering to improve font sharpness. \r\n \r\nI understand that
    \"font appearance\" and \"sharpness\" are opposite due to limited screen resolution.
    It might be a matter of personal preference but I like reading sharp and crisp
    text rather than text that faithfully reproduces font shapes but is diffuse and
    has gray shadows instead of sharp stems, as it is produced by some current rendering
    methods.\r\n\r\nI start with fonts rendered at 2X dimension and then resize them
    at their final size using subpixel positioning; image 1) is the one that is modified
    (a 2x version actually). "
