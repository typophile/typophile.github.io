  body: Especially after that Typecon presentation. Does anyone know a good source
    to purchase a wide range of Mexican/Latino typefaces? (Besides the obvious like
    Myfonts?)

  body: "Dan, you could try Veer, who sell a lot of the work by <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/home\">Sudtipos</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I don't know if you can purchase any fonts there, but <a href=\"\">Letras Latinas</a>
    has many faces on view from all over South America."
