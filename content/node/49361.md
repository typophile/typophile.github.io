body: Me and some friends are making a fanzine, and I'm on the lookout for something
  special in terms of binding. Print run is somewhere below hundred, page count plus/minus
  30. Any ideas?

  body: It depends on your friends budget and what they mean in terms of something
    special. The usual thing with fanzines that I'm familiar with is simple saddle
    stitching, i.e. staples through the spine of folded pages, but that isn't very
    special at all. Just cheap and easy.

  body: There's a lot of time available, but not a lot money except whatever we might
    get from sales (4-5$ each mag).
