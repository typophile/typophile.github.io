body: "Is it possible to save the argument of a new command in a string; i.e. NOT
  a box, and NOT a macro, that will run the argument every time it is called.\r\n\r\nE.g.
  the argument is \\cite{PhG}\r\n\r\nI want to save the result of this, but not so
  that \\cite is executed every time I use the string -- in which case I will get
  a different, undesired result, like \"ibid.\"\r\n\r\nI also do not want it to be
  a box, because I want to preserve the options to use either a hbox or a vbox.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"
