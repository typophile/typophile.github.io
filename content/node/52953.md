  body: "Looks as if the folks at Punchcut are making some modifications to the Typophile
    web application.\r\n\r\nTip: run an identical copy of the web application on a
    test server and when changes are made to it they can be tested on the test server
    copy where users won't see the process and arn't affected by it. That way they
    don't have to freak out when they see the half-functional interface they are seeing
    now. Complete the modifications on the test server first and get everything working
    before transferring the updated web application to the live web server.\r\n\r\nIf
    I have guessed wrong about this, would the folks at Punchcut kindly provide an
    explanation for what is happening please?\r\n\r\nUsers will appreciate being informed
    on a need to know basis. One senior Typophiler recently described Punchcut's ongoing
    reluctance to explain things to users as \"infuriating\". So if you guys read
    that comment I posted in Caren Litherland's flickr stream rest assured \"infuriating\"
    did not originate with me but came from a U.S Typophiler who enjoys a very good
    reputation in this community.\r\n\r\nI'm not the only user who is critical of
    Punchcut's management of Typophile. Just the most vocal one.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: Making changes and testing on a copy of the website on another server or different
    dir on the same server sounds quite logical to me. Doint it on the <em>live</em>
    website has always seemed weird to me, but has been like that since I joined Typophile.

    should know that messing around with the web app like this and giving users the
    silent treatment endears you to nobody.\r\n\r\nWell at least they are predictable,
    if infuriating. A definition of Typophile for the uninitiated:\r\n\r\nAn infuriating
    but predictable guerrilla marketing vehicle for FontShop, Font Bureau, Veer and

    and that it is holiday season.\r\n\r\nWell, of course there\u2019s room for improvement.
    There always is.\r\nBut maintaining Typophile isn\u2019t exactly an enterprise
    that you could refer to as milking the cash cow. You\u2019re pretty demanding.
    I\u2019m not saying \u2018Don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth\u2019 \u2013
    participate, and help making this an even better place. But, please, make sure
    your criticism is rather constructive than slanderous.\r\nBtw, Punchcut asks for
    <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/contact\">feedback</a> at the bottom of each
    page.\r\n\r\nJames said:\r\n<cite>An infuriating but predictable guerrilla marketing

    is what you feel, I wonder why you spend so much time here.\r\nThe Wiki has a
    more accurate description of what [[Typophile]] is about.\r\n\r\nF"

    enjoyed the creativity around here. (Don't mind me \u2014\_I was never and still
    am not someone you'd know). However, I can't say I've missed some of the attitudes
    people have on creative boards, with mr. Arboghast the latest entitlement complex
    case I've come across.\r\n\r\nJames \u2014 if I may call you that \u2014 Punchcut
    runs typophile as a favor to it's users. The moment you start paying a monthly
    fee (I see no mention of this anywhere) is the moment you get to feel entitled.
    Until then, try and relax. Life is too short for this kind of attitude."

  body: FontShop, Veer, etc. sponsor Typophile in exchange for their ads, so it is
    disingenuous to call it a "guerilla marketing vehicle".
