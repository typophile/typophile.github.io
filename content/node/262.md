  body: ' I like it, I think it would gain by just being black though, skip the photoshopped
    shadows&#40;?&#41; and greyscale in the text. It&#39;s nice. Especially like the

  body: ' Ole -- I agree with Richard about the shadow, though cool, distracts from
    the killer type treatment. <BR> <BR>I would add a smidgen of breathing space at
    the top and bottom of the company name. <BR> <BR>The curly O is nice as is the
    HE lig. <BR> <BR>the Ms are nice too, but might benefit from lighter diagonals;
    they seem a tad bit dark. <BR> <BR>Nice work. <BR> <BR>BTW, what kind of construction
    firm is it? It seems more upscale than your basic general contractors with hardhats. '

  body: ' The grey type is actually metallic ink on the real deal. And yes the shadow
    should not be there, but the client loves it. This is not a total pain to work
    with as I an about to to apply graphics to the company truck. '
