  body: "I take it you are looking for a fairly standard Roman letter, rather than
    Bible style blackletter or scripts. Anyway, you already have one script on the
    page. Something that looks reassuring without a lot of harsh threatening angles
    and that might even be seen as \"inspirational.\"  \r\nIf you really want to limit
    your choices to free, you might as well get something that's well made. A good
    prospect is  Calluna  by Jos Buivenga at exljbris. The regular weight is currently
    available free from Myfonts. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/\r\nBTW
    white on black for this topic suggests a funeral. Why not something in a cheerful
    pastel?\r\nDon"
