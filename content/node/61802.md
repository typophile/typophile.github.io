body: "So I really want to use neutraface for a corporate identity--from logo through
  to brochure copy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the uppercase E really bothers me. It's too modern.
  I think the face would be perfect if it weren't for that one character, which is
  used in typesetting the company's name. \r\n\r\nOn the House Industries website
  they show the large N from neutraface--but the text below it--that E is different,
  and I can't seem to find an alternate version in the Try Font feature..\r\n\r\nIs
  that neutraface or not? A different cut of Futura than what I have? (the R in that
  looks much better than mine).\r\n\r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/include/getimage.php?id=8002"
