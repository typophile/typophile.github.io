body: "Hi.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering what the name of Habbo Hotel's new font is. They're
  using this font more and more.\r\n\r\nIt's both nice looking and easy to read. As
  you see, it has some nice touch to the \"n\", \"g\", \"a\", \"p\" etc. which makes
  the font so cool.\r\n\r\nI've added a picture underneath, taken inside the game.\r\n\r\n<strong>NB!</strong>
  The image is too wide for the forum, so you have to scroll horisontaly to see the
  whole image.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/teksten-sulake_6479.png]\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much in advance,\r\nKai-Erik."
