  the image linked.\r\n- The chat in lower left corner.\r\n- Fire Elemental text in
  middle.\r\n- Cho'Gall text to the right.\r\netc.\r\n\r\nI've been looking for the
  name of this font for ages. At first I thought it was as simple as Times New Roman
  but it doesn't look the same when I use it.\r\nAlso, might be noteworthy. the \"^\"
  letter is kind of small. Might be of significance or not. :)"

    the correct one. ^ was not the same and some other letters stood out. \xEA also
    became k for some reason, might just been a bug though.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fk4GW.jpg\r\nHere
    is another screenshot that may be with bigger fontsize.\r\n\r\nI've tested out
    Times New Roman, Centaur, Palatino Linotype and Souvenir so far and it wasn't
    any of them."

  body: "Check this out. Different versions of Souvenir have different sized carets
    (that what I'd call this character ^). Check out the carets in these two versions
    of Souvenir...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/souv_4572.png]\r\nTop one's
    small, bottom one's much bigger. I suppose it's possible that the developers are
    using a customized version of Souvenir, one that isn't commercially available
    and has special characters for precise needs within the game."

    2012-09-21 06-09-14-488_5242.jpg]\r\nHere you can see a comparison, pretty god
    damn good. (Upper name is the Souvenir font I downloaded now compared to the cropped
    name of screenshot I linked before). There may be a slight difference with the
    caret positioning or I'm imagining things, but that is nothing I care about.\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot for the help, never thought I'd find it. :)"
