  architects drawings.  This is the period pre Leroy machines and pre AutoCad, when
  carefully penciled lettering was the mark of a professional. P22 has several attractive
  hand drawn fonts that are correct for the time frame but a bit too decorative for
  much except titles.  I'm seeking something better suited to notes and dimensions.
  \ Think of an anti-Tekton.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any thoughts."

    for the time frame I'm working with.

  body: You might also like <a href="http://www.p22.com/IHOF/operinaset.html">P22
    Operina Pro</a>. But not because it is period appropriate, because it isn't. But
    it has a certain je  ne sais quoi.

    \ I had forgotten completely about Operina Pro, which looks like it will be useful
    if I can moderate it's je ne sais quoi just a little.\r\n\r\nIn any case, thank
    you both for the helpful input!\r\n\r\nWill"
