body: "I am looking for typefaces that have a softer appearance ( but not entirely
  rounded ) but are striking, and preferable have a tall x height.\r\nAlso what would
  be typefaces that could fit well in with substance of the aviation industry but
  with a certain warmth. \r\n\r\nI don't know if this helps but if Cubano was oblique
  and just a little thinner and taller i think it might be able to give that feel.
  The typefaces I am looking for need not be oblique or italicised , but this particular
  explanation seems to reach my understanding. Any other help is also appreciated."
