body: This concept is for 'The Altitude Academy' a start-up business that offers training
  in mountain climbing, skiing and trekking. It's target audience is anyone interested
  in adventure sports and pushing themselves a little further through intensive training.
  I'm looking for feedback regarding legibility and balance...and obviously if it
  is speaking to it's target audience well enough. Cheers :)

  body: "A bit too much sci-fi to me. And not much legible.\r\nAlso, you should start
    in black and white first, then add colour. Speaking of which, I would expect the
    gradient to have white on top, not bottom."

  body: "I like it. Some comments:\r\n- don't think Futura works\r\n- colors too tech,
    would be nice with a more natural feel (also to balance the technical construction)\r\n-
    maybe try some texturing on the mark\r\n- try without the stabbing T\r\n- maybe
    spell out the name below the mark\r\n"

  body: I like the general concept but it needs to be more legible. Try showing it
    to some folks without telling them what it says, and ask them to read it. My guess
    is that most folks will have trouble. And like riccard0 said, the gradient should
    have the lighter color at the top.

  body: I like it but don't think it is legible enough either. My first thought was
    that it is a bit heavy metal, and then realised it reminded me of the [[http://rockcinema.eu/resources/Anthrax_logo.jpg|Anthrax
    logo]]. I don't think that is any reason to radically change what you've done.
    I like the way it fits together like one of those tangram puzzles, and probably
    just adding a bit more space between each piece would improve legibility.

  body: Thanks everyone for the great feedback. I suspected it may be hard to read.
    It's so difficult to be objective when you have been looking at something for
    a while. I'll take your comments into consideration when working on the next stage...

  body: "I like the style there is just too much of it, very busy. Why not simplify
    it right down and use the first letter the A. Maybe you could have a couple of
    small black silhouette figures roped together ascending its slope. This will create
    a strong simple icon with the emphasis on the 2 key points, the mountains and
    people. Underneath it render the company name in a strong clean font in black.\r\n\r\nI
    have done quite a lot of work for the adventure industry, keep in mind that they
    will probably want this embroidered on their uniforms, so keep is clean, strong
    and simple, think of successful brands like North Face and how they are used.\r\n\r\nI
    like the colour, it has an alpine feel."
