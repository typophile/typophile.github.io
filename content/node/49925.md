body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI am designing a Powerpoint presentation on a luxury hotel and resorts
  brand. I would like to add small icons to suggest aspects of travel, ie. \r\n\r\nfood
  and drink, plane, bed (accommodation), shopping, business meeting, spa etc.\r\n\r\nI
  was going to draw them straight into Illustrator, but does anyone know any fonts
  that would be good for this? They must be a font and not 3D icons etc as I need
  to customise the colours.\r\n\r\nI am looking for clear and simple travel signage
  similar to Swiss style or some quirky icons would be good.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n"
