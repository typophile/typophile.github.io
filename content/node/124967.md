  Text actually) with a nice serif like Copernicus, Merriweather, Sina, Georgia. You
  get it, right ? Pretty easy at this point.\r\n\r\nMy issue is to match sizes of
  the fonts because Brandon Text is a high ascender font. All the serif I try to pair
  with have a larger x-height than Brandon.\r\n\r\nBasically, in a perfect world,
  I should be able to have both fonts on the same line with a similar Ascender height.
  I know Garamond works well, but I look for a font with a contemporary feeling.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance guys.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
