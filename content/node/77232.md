body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for specific fonts that have parts missing, or are
  very reductionist in their structure. I want to use it for a set of covers for Georges
  Perec books. In his books the missing memory, a void, missing letters etc. play
  a very important part, and I would like to reflect this in the type. It still needs
  to be legible, but it's OK if it's a bit puzzling. I would prefer sans-serif or
  slightly flared typefaces, with possibly a certain \"french connection\". I like
  Futura Black but I don\"t know if this is completely what I'm looking for. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot!"

    of illustration I want to use. It needs to be more of a display font. But thanks.
    \r\n\r\nI knew about the AW Conqueror fonts and like them a lot, but a shadow
    font is not really what I'm looking for here.\r\n\r\nAny more ideas?"

  body: "Thanks all for the suggestions! I think Avia is still the closest for now
    to what I'm looking for. \r\n\r\nStop, Tralfamadore, and Morphica are a bit to
    techy for this. I've been considering Bifur as well, but I'm not sure yet if it's
    not too geometric. I like the idea of the multicolored parts, but would be better
    in a bit more 'postmodern' design.\r\n\r\nAuriol is a bit too oldfashioned, Art
    Nouveau for this. \r\n\r\nJust to give some more info on Perec; he lived from
    1936 to 1982, was a member of Oulipo (Workshop for experimental literature) and
    one of the best postmodern authors. In his work he often uses constraints and
    mathematical structures. He was jewish (both of his parents died in WWII) and
    this had a significant implicit impact on his work. Missing elements (like a novel
    without the letter E) or storylines that revolve around a void, a loss of memory.
    \r\n\r\nI hope this helps give you some ideas?! "
