  features - such as saving and restoring &#34;snapshots&#34; of your font folder,
  managing fonts, and &#34;defrenzying&#34; your fonts folder back to Windows defaults
  for when you need maximim speed and performance from your computer. <BR> <BR>This
  is not a commercial program and no money is being, or will be made, from it. <BR>
  <BR>If you&#39;d like to check it out, you can find it at: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontfrenzy.org"
  target="_blank">http://www.fontfrenzy.org</a> <BR> <BR>We&#39;d greatly appreciate
  any feedback. <BR> <BR>--mjf'

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Great stuff, Malcolm. I&#39;d like to  <BR>hear comments
    from our Windows-based Typophiles  <BR>as to how it performs. Anyone up for test-driving
    the  <BR>little critter?

    is an excellent idea. Font manager developers on the Mac <BR>side would do well
    to incorporate something like this.
