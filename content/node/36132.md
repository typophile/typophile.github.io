  in particular New Yorkers. Now, I know its hard to generalise, but working in England,
  its hard to gain a thorough understanding of design in the US.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate
  if you guys could help me out with some stuff. I am focusing on publication design
  (books/magazines/catalogues). Obviously you could advise me on typography but also
  size, format, colour trends, overall style (like minimalist for example), image
  usage and anything else you can think off.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing what
  you have to say.\r\n\r\nThank you"

    and globalization and all that?\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can suggest is maybe pick
    up Print's regional design annual and see if any specific trends pop up there."

    with internet, styles are pretty different from place to place. Switzerland and
    Netherland have a very distinctive graphic design for example. Doesn't mean people
    from elsewhere are not looking at it and inspiring, as well as swiss will get
    inspired by other countries and tendencies."

  body: "As for books, I'll hazard my sense of what's common now. Yes, I'm American
    and living in a suburb of the State of New York\u2014I was even born and raised
    in NYC.\r\n\r\nI see one from column A and one from column B, if you will: what's
    popular and,  therefore, utilitarian; and what's (I don't mean this derogatorily,
    tho' there was certainly a time and place when it would have been) artsy.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think there's any new trend with the popular. It's pretty much for the usual
    suspects in the way of page size and font choices. For instance, 6\" x 9\" pages
    of, say, 10/12 New Baskerville or Adobe Garamond is not an unlikely combo.\r\n\r\nBut
    I take it that what I lump in as \"artsy\" is what's of more interest. And there
    I'd say that I see more sans serif than ever in books' body text. Especially in
    books where the body text is blocky: in short paragraphs with display heads occurring
    often and lots of surrounding white space.\r\n\r\nI guess it's a modernist trend
    that started some time ago and hasn't really abated\u2014perhaps it's a reaction
    to what's <em>au courant</em> in the first column and so won't change much till
    the popular/utilitarian stuff starts to change.\r\n\r\nOr else some of the folks
    here could jump-start a brand new direction and others could be engaged to make
    it a trend. Then, who knows, we might forestall the predicted demise of the printed
    book as we know it."
