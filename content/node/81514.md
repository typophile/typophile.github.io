body: Can anyone help me determine what typeface this is. The 'W' is very distinctive
  and I would really like to find out what it is.

  body: P.S. It almost looks Gill Sans with a very strange 'w'. I found something
    similar called 'Documenta' but it is still no where near the same.

  body: "House Neutraface 2 might be a match. In the original Neutraface, there was
    an alternate W like this, but the E was different. Neutraface 2 has a normal E
    and R, so this could be the answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "That /S/ doesn't look like Gill nor Neutraface to me.\r\nI think there's
    a decent chance that this /W/ is made from overlapping /V/s rather than being
    part of the original font."

  body: "Yes, that's possible, of course. Unfortunately these aren't the best letters
    for making a positive ID. I agree that the S in the sample seems a bit more symmetrical
    than those in Neutraface 2, so it could be almost any sans with a symmetrical
    S.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
