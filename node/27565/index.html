  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys,

I've been working on my first homemade font for the past few days, but encountered a bit of a problem.
Since I wanted the font to be as complete as can be, I checked around for any kind of character/accent I could find & ended up with a little over 300 characters in total. When I export the font from Fontographer (version 4.something) in EPS, everything is included, but when I drag the font into Font Reserve Browser, the character map only shows 256 characters. In PopChar Pro it might even be less.
Can anyone tell me what happened to the rest & how to get them to show up in at least Font Reserve Browser?
I could always divide the font into 2 typefaces, one with the "normal" characters & the second one for all the strange accents, but I'd like to keep it in a whole if possible.</div>

It's not really a problem that the character map doesn't show all the characters, but just that it unables me to use them (PopChar Pro shows even less characters).
I'm already up to about 320 characters, so maybe making a seperate font for the accents & symbols is the best solution?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, Miguel is bound to have a lot more experience than me with Macs and Unicode, but I do believe that dividing the character set into two fonts would do the trick, albeit it at a considerable loss of convenience (especially if you're using InDesign).

That's because, in an "alternate" font, the characters that would have high Unicode numbers can be put in the slots normally reserved for common characters. So, for instance, in Scala Sans Regular Expert, the dimension sign (×) glyph can be found in the slot normally reserved for the tilde, and the fl ligature resides in the slot normally reserved for the question mark. In other words, when you switch to Scala Sans Regular Expert and type a tilde, you get ×, and when you type a question mark, you get an fl ligature.

As far as the operating system is concerned, there are no characters above ASCII 255; the OS doesn't need to support Unicode for you to be able to access "special" glyphs if they're put in the slots for "normal" glyphs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the information!
It is indeed a lot less practical to divide the font into "regular" & "alternate", but finding the right character won't be a problem thanks to PopChar. It'll just be time consuming to switch fonts all the time.
Strange though that Fontographer does allow you to add more characters than can actually be used. I opened an existing fontfile in it to see what kind of characters existed (a whole lot more than I ever imagined!) & that had more characters than you can actually use as well. I just thought it would be easier to make one huge font instead of selecting characters per language. Heck, I don't even know in what languages half of the strange combinations (eg. a "t" with "¸") are used ;-)
I also added a few custom characters such as an exponential © & ® (next to a normal sized © & ®), an exponential "st", "nd", "rd" & "th" (for 1st, 2nd,...), some extra fractions & a character for Co., so I've got even more characters than any font I've seen so far.
I'm also working on a dingbat font to go with it, so I guess it'll have to be a 3-piece typeface.</div>

True. In an Unicode world that's called hacking :)  as you'd be assigning incorrect Unicode values to characters.</div>

Tom, the bottom line is that a proper OpenType font with all bits and pieces in the proper places is better than the old "hacks" -- such as PS1 fonts divided into basic and expert etc -- for a number of reasons, especially standards compliance and ease of use (with software that can handle automatic glyph substitution etc such as InDesign). If you plan to release your font(s), you should upgrade your OS rather than opt for what Miguel has rightly called a hack.

From your comments, it seems that you need to study Unicode a little more before expending more time and effort on your font production. A good place to start is the <a href="http://unicode.org/" target="_blank">Unicode web site</a>. A useful tool is their <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unibook/index.html" target="_blank">Unibook application</a> (free), which is actually not very easy to find on the site.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, seeing as I don't have any typographic background whatsoever (except for knowing the diference between Arial & Helvetica ;-) & what I learned along the process now) & only made this font as a "study" (it started off as 10 custom letters for an illustration I was working on), I think the hack would be a well enough solution.
I'm not planning on releasing this font, but just wanted to have all the characters for myself. Once you start working on a few neccesary accents, it's hard to know where to stop. Since I propably won't ever -or very rarely- use the expert characters, it'll be OK to stack them together in an expert version. I'd have to use PopChar to select the right character anyway since I haven't got a clue where they would normally go (I don't even know what some of them are supposed to be or when they could be of any use). I'll spend some extra time in selecting all the characters I'll probably end up using & put them in the regular version.
Thanks for all the usefull information though, I learned a lot!
If I ever decide to make a second font including all accents, I'll be sure to check out the Unicode website & do a proper study befóre starting.
Oh... ànd I'll finally update to OS X first as well ;-)</div>
