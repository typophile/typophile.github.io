  do you guys think? First the logo itself, then the slogan.\r\n\r\nDo you see a problem
  with the slogan \"Live like you mean it\"? I know its been used time and time again
  by many institutions, but I don't think its a big deal. I think the logotype is
  very interesting...don't know if I necessarily like it, but interesting. What do
  you think?\r\n\r\nJon E."

    Wisconsin a little too relaxing for that slogan? I guess there are some rough
    parts of Milwaukee, but other than that\u2026\r\n\r\nAs for the logo, it\u2019s
    too busy. And I have no clue what is going on with that weird flourish on the
    W. "

    with you about the logo, it is busy. It almost looks like a sideway 1 on the W.
    I kinda like the typographic treatment on the N though...\r\n\r\nJonE."

    mind.\r\n\r\nMaybe, \"Live like your ancestors\", or \"Live like you would like
    to live if you didn't have to work at a non-agricultural job\".\r\n\r\nOr they
    should just go all the way:\r\n\r\n\"Wisconsin. The home of the Green Bay Packers.\""

    of not bordering North or South Dakota :)

    .. lol :)\r\n\r\nLogo-wise I think the color choice is awful. It's like a youthful
    logo that is meant to appeal to a geriatric audience. And what's with the dot
    after a (lowercase) slogan ?\r\n\r\nIt is however memorable. So one may argue
    they have achieved one of their rebranding goals."

  body: "I have to agree that the message conveyed by the mark is mixed. The colors
    are...static to say the least, but the typeface, it's treatment, and cartwheeling
    guy convey motion. The placement of the tagline seems arbitrary and the content
    ('live like you mean it') doesn't seem to mesh with most people's idea of Wisconsin
    - even if it hadn't been used before by others. \r\n\r\nThat being said - the
    colors aren't bad for a mark regarding Wisconsin, just for use in THIS mark regarding
    Wisconsin. \r\n\r\nThis whole thing looks rather rushed to me. "
