  was hoping to find a modern serif complementary to Trade Gothic. Any suggestions.

  body: "I was recently working on an identity project and needed a very neutral serif.
    Everything seemed to get very period against a rather neutral sans. I ended up
    using Lucida Bright for several reasons.\r\n\r\nLook at some of the Clarendon
    types as well."

    is one of my favorites, but isn't necessarily very modern, but would work well
    with Trade Gothic.

  body: "\"The font you pick should be representative of yourself.\"\r\n\r\nperhaps
    easier for some than others... i find it very hard.\r\n\r\nOn my old one I originally
    had mercury and interstate. But i designed it on a job that had Mercury, and I
    don't own it... nor Whitman. Is there a good serif that says cheapo?\r\n\r\nI'll
    have to stop being so cheap and buy something new. Likely mercury or whitman."

  body: I have always liked the way Century Expanded looks with Trade Gothic (or News
    Gothic). I don't know that it looks very "modern" though.

    Some people DO respect EULAs!\r\n\r\nUtopia might work. I don't own TG, but I
    know that Utopia mixes well with the Grots like it."
