<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This is how it works:
<ul><li>A couple of words are published in the Type ID Pop Quiz, possibly -- but not necessarily -- providing a hint.</li>
<li>Try to identify the typeface. To win, you need to e-mail me both the correct name and weight.</i>
<li>Show off your knowledge by casually mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it, when and by whom was it (first) published, and other cool stuff to impress your fellow Typophiles with.</li>
<li>Every week a new challenge will be posted.</li>
<li>The person who wins a game can't win the next game.</ul>
In case of any disputes, I will act as judge, jury and avenging angel of wrath.
If you think this is too easy, maybe try the <a href=http://typophile.com/node/28061>Intermediary Level Type ID Pop Quiz</a> or <a href=http://typophile.com/node/27994>Expert Level Type ID Pop Quiz</a>.
Good luck everyone, and have fun. ;^)

<div class=commentbody>Nope, it's not. ;^)
Book Antiqua is a shameless rip-off by Monotype of the true original typeface by another major type foundry. It caused its renowned and celebrated type designer to part ways with ATypI upon ATypI's failure to denounce this ethical abomination. Recent events gave a quite surreal turn to this case.
BTW I asked to e-mail me the response so that other beginners would have the occasion to participate to the quiz as well. ;^)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I was kidding, Yves! I know the story; I was trying to allude to it.
I thought that the tip-off would be that I described it as a "workhorse text face", when in fact the original was intended as a display face, and not as the text face that it eventually became. Oh, and the made-up trademark Monotype Original™. :D
(I did miss the part about submitting by e-mail. Sorry if I inadvertently spoiled the quiz.)</div>

Georgia, Georgia,
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
I'm say Georgia
Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
<strong>As moonlight through the pines</strong>
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
I said Georgia,
Ooh Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Georgia,
Georgia,
No peace, no peace I find
Just this old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
I said just an old sweet song,
Keeps Georgia on my mind</div>

<div class=commentbody>"Georgia is a font designed in 1993 by Matthew Carter for Microsoft." thats from wikipedia.
Also i think its interesting how some fonts designed for microsoft like georgia are good, but others like book antique and of course arial are less than good. Although I don't know if Georgia's only real merit is screen legibility.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The more I think about it, the more I think that 1996 makes more sense than 1993. Georgia was designed for on-screen and web use. NCSA Mosaic, the first graphical browser that I know of, was released in 1993 and didn't really begin to catch on until early 1994. The Netscape browser didn't exist until late 1994.
Perhaps we should verify it and possibly correct the entry in Wikipedia?</div>

<div class=commentbody>ok, i've been fortunate enough to hear the designer of the typeface speaking at an evening in an exhibition of the works of adrian frutiger. that made it easier.
i think the best translation would be "german federal mail". this is a strong link to the original reason to design this typeface.</div>

"FF Meta by Erik Spiekermann.
Originally developed as "PT 55" for the West German Post Office (Deutsche Bundespost) in 1985, but ultimately rejected in favour of Helvetica. The typeface was later released as FF Meta. The name refers to Metadesign, a design studio that was founded (among others) by Spiekermann."

<div class=commentbody>Hehe, you're welcome. I hated it that the Type ID Pop Quiz became so incredibly difficult that a lot of people felt they were being left out. This is more my idea of an interactive and collaborative forum, where users of all levels can participate.</div>

<div class=commentbody>From Bart De Ruycke, again the most complete answer:
<a href=http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_hydrous.html>Hydrous</a> is a typeface created in 2001 by Thai designer <a href=http://www.psyops.com/html/info.html>Anuthin 'Newt' Wongsunkakon</a> in collaboration with <a href"http://www.psyops.com/html/info.html">Rodrigo Cavazos</a> and published by <a href=http://www.psyops.com/html/info.html>PSY/OPS</a>. Wongsunkakon teaches graphic design at Chulalongkorn Bangkok University and is a prolific designer of Thai typefaces. The industrial sans serif's most striking feature, is the raindrop-like terminal, which re-enforces the typeface's subtle "hydrous" character.
Nice going guys! Next challenge coming up.</div>

"Hi Yves, the font currently posted is Bank Gothic Medium, designed by
Morris Fuller Benton in 1930 for the American Type Founders Company. This font is bundled with Corel Draw and Corel Word Perfect Suite. Bank Gothic is severly overused, but I'm sure I don't need to tell you that ;) Oh yah and it looks like it is the Bitstream version."

<div class=commentbody>My internet was having the hiccups last night, so it was even more than 24 hours extra. The sample was [[Zuzana Licko]]'s bodacious <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=E.103797.0.0">Tarzana Wide</a>, but I used the alternate 'a'. Fooled some of you! :^)

<div class=commentbody>Argh, Tarzana was really hard. It was indeed the alternate 'a' that threw me. It had an Emigre feel to it (in retrospect I was probably picking up Zuzana Licko's style). But I skipped right past Tarzana when I was looking through Emigre fonts! Very, very tricky. Good job.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, Stuart. :^)
This is what Eron had to say:
<em>"Hello again Yves -- this one was definitely trickier than the last one. I had fun finding the answer :) The font is Tarzana Wide Regular by Emigre (1998). I like the type id quizzes because they really make you examine the font (if you don't know what it is right away). While searching for this one, I noticed how unique many of the letterforms were; the tail on the 'd' for instance, and the hook on 'c'."</em>
Reactions like this one is what makes this Type ID Pop Quiz worth doing. :^)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmmm... I have the impresion interest in this quiz is waning.
This was Stuart's reply:
<em>"This is BookmanBT by Bitstream. It clearly is of Bookman lineage but it differs markedly from other fonts named Bookman. BookmanBT is based on Alexander Phemister's Antique Old Style, whereas ITC Bookman is a redrawing by Ed Benguiat. Monotype Bookman Old Style, despite its name, is fairly similar to ITC Bookman Light. (Source: MyFonts.com)
This is really cool, I hadn't noticed the different "flavors" of Bookman before. Not only is Type ID Pop Quiz fun, it's educational too!"</em></div>

Stephen's answer:
<em>"The type sample is 'Adobe Warnock Pro'.
When I read "Encapsulated PostScript" I instantly thought of Adobe for some reason, and that immediately triggered the thought, 'Warnock Pro'. I guess it's because Adobe and PostScript have so much to do with each other, and Warnock's a face I've noticed popping up several times of late on the Type ID Board.
Designed by Robert Slimbach for Adobe in 2000, Warnock Pro was named after John Warnock, the co-founder of Adobe Systems, and was the Winner of the <a href=http://tdc.org/news/2001Results/index.html>2001 Type Directors Club Type Design Competition</a>. It is also included with Apple's Mac OS X operating system. Slimbach's other typefaces include (among many, many others), Adobe Garamond Pro, Adobe Jenson Pro and Adobe Minion Pro. (Sources: adobe.com and indentifont.com)."</em>
I'd like to point out that the family was <em>a</em> winner, as there are no rankings assigned at this competition.</div>
