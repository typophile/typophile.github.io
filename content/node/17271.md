    in the spirit of the linotype fonts\u2026\r\nthis one is closed of one I am looking
    http://www.linotype.com/111022/ahmedregular-font.html\r\n\r\nI forget to tell
    you that this font is made to be view (and read) on and off tv screen (must be
    very readable with open eyes) and will certainly be the arabic typography companion
    of a font like FF Strada or ITC Tabula\u2026"

    body: "I saw the font, here you are a screen capture for review:\r\nhttp://www.deviantart.com/deviation/38119599/\r\n\r\nIt
      is a free font, called ae_khalid ( belongs to ArabEyes ), Created by FAZLUR
      RAHMAN QURAISHI. Regenarated by Mr.Nadim Shakili ( I work with him in the arabeyes
      project by the way). Typeface and data \xA9 2003, Arabeyes.org. Font is distributed
      under the terms of GPL license.\r\nMore information about GPL license please
      click this link: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html \r\n\r\nIn my opinion:
      This font may work fine but I am not sure if it can handel a big mount of text.

    if it could handle a lot of text it wouldn't work\r\nwell onscreen! :-)  That's
    just the nature of the beast.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, this isn't the font that I
    remember seeing...\r\nMight there be another one? (Or am I just getting old?)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      he want a font for TV at first, but now I rereaded the thread again, and I have
      noticed that.\r\nAny way, I didn't see till now except one font in DubaiTV.
      But May be it uses more than one font, not like other Arabic channels as Al-3rabiya
      & Rotana. I will put your note in its best channel, and reply you with more
      information as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nBTW, there was some font used in writing
      NEWS word ( akhbar \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062E\u0628\u0627\u0631 ) which is tottaly
      different than ae_Khalid, but I didn't mention it because it was just for that
      word, like a display font. So I don't think you got that old yet, sir. :-)"
