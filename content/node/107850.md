    is very similar to the image but there are some differences. If not lettering,
    then it may have been another foundry's version, name unknown. Linotype's version
    is true to the original metal from Klingspor, 1931; designed by H. Maehler. Source:
    Jaspert.\r\n\r\nSteffman's version appears to be the same as the Linotype version."

  body: "As noted in my edited post, thanks George for getting the correct reference.\r\nOn
    looking closely at the Der Spiegel cover I am almost certain it is lettering.
    Jaspert's _Type Encyclopaedia (1970)_ gives very little information, but this
    is sufficient to suggest it is probable that H. Maeher adapted the pre Great War
    lettering, either from the  cover or another source. As you say, the Linotype
    designer did a faithful digitization and Steffmann did a renamed pirated version.\r\nDon"

  body: "I'm not certain if the 1908 Spiegel cover is lettering or a typeface, and
    I do not have a name or designer.\r\nThere is a digital font that seems to be
    derived from the same source. It is Louisianne by Dieter Steffmann\r\n[I deleted
    the rest of my post. Thanks George for spotting the digital source of Steffmann's
    font, i.e. Klingspors's Salut of 1931, as digitized by Linotype. I do not link
    to known pirated fonts.]\r\nDon"
