  body: "Wow... sorry about that. I was putting forward a suggestion but you blow
    it out of proportion...\r\n\r\nI had said it was BitStream Vera Sans Mono, and
    I'm afraid that will be your best bet. The font in your sample is included in
    the GD package and I've been searching for an hour for a download but nothing
    comes up. Too bad it was all in vain and that your attitude is a bit lacking."

      doesn\u2019t match, for starters\u2026\"\r\n\r\nThat is all you posted. What
      am I and the other readers of this thread supposed to think about \"Nevermind,
      the \u2018A\u2019 doesn\u2019t match, for starters\u2026\"\r\n\r\nYes, I have
      a bad attitude when mindless dolts type meaningless & pointless posts.\r\n\r\nToo
      bad you're lame and this site is a bit lacking...\r\n\r\nDelete my account with
      typophile.\r\n\r\nI have that font by the way & that is NOT it.."

  body: "I'm sorry. The problem is this forum doesn't include a message when you edit
    a post... As I said, I had initially suggest Vera Sans, but then realised that
    the 'A' doesn't match for starters.\r\n\r\nI still continued looking for an hour
    and, as I mentioned above, it is a default font included in the GD package. Tried
    looking for a download, as it is one of the XFonts for *nix but nothing came up
    I'm afraid. If you know how to compile the fonts from the C source code, you could
    download the GD library and take it from there.\r\n\r\nI would have preferred
    it if you hadn't called me mindless, as my post was an indication that I was trying
    to help you."

  body: Dear Bones, I'm quite surprised at how you made a pretty harmless misunderstanding
    explode in a mere two posts. I think it is pretty clear that Vincent thought he
    recognised the typeface you wanted identified, but realised he was wrong. Your
    double-post made Vincent suppose your reaction was overblown. Clearing up that
    misunderstanding would've been far more constructive than starting to insult him.
    We're a very civilised forum,  and I really don't like how you handled this situation.

  body: "And Vincent, maybe next time add an [edit] to your post to avoid any misunderstandings.
    ;^)\r\n\r\nBTW The fact that both his comments are registered at the exact same
    time should've told you this was an unintentional double-post, not a aggressive
    one."

  body: I know Yves. I only realised it too late; after realising I'd ID'd it wrong
    I went to look for a match. I knew where to start (GD) but I didn't know when
    to stop :-). Got a bit caught up in the moment lol.
