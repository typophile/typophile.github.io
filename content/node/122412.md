  body: Of course, there was the time when (presumably) they <em>had</em> a lot of
    typeface expertise in-house. Thus, <em>The Printing of Mathematics</em>, was by
    T(heodore) W(illiam) Chaundy, a mathematician who taught at Oxford, and Charles
    Batey, "printer to the University" - and P. R. Barrett, whose role I cannot identify,
    but he may well have been the actual Monotype operator in the group.

  body: "Mr Barrett was the specialist maths proof-reader in the printing division
    of OUP in Oxford, and, as a young proof-reader myself, I was privileged to know
    him there in the early 1980s, shortly before his retirement. \r\n\r\nThere was
    indeed considerable in-house expertise in the printing house, but the printing
    division in Oxford was to some extent separate from the publishing division, and
    only dealt with a small part of the total amount published by OUP in the UK. The
    publishing division (\u2018them upstairs\u2019) had a considerable body of experts
    of its own. But that was a long time ago. :)"

  body: Thank you very much for the information! Yes, times change, and what with
    desktop computers and laser printers having the potential ability to put out near-professional-quality
    typesetting, replacing typesetters with typists was understandably an overwhelming
    temptation.
