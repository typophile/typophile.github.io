body: Another riddle I haven&#39;t been able to solve on my own is what exact type
  the most widely used Hungarian bible is set in. <BR>The edition I refer to was published
  in 1989, so it may not be available digitally at all. <BR>I&#39;m looking for the
  type of the main text, but if the bold face used for the heading in the middle of
  the sample looks familiar to you, feel free to give it a shot. <BR> <BR>The cap
  height of the sample letters is approx. 1.7 mm, so the details are not necessarily
  100% reliable. <BR> <BR>With the exception of &#34;non-biblical&#34; glyphs such
  as &amp; or Q, I can produce any sample needed :-&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks again, <BR>Endre

    these letters should be enough, but so far, I am having no luck.&#41;

  body: So far, the bold type &#40;Kristus fogantatasa..&#41; looks like Monotype
    Albion Bold &#40;see Encyclopaedia of Typefaces - Jaspert, et al.&#41;, but I
    am still looking.

  body: Thanks for your efforts, Mike. Here are the shapes requested.  <BR> <BR>If
    you need more shapes of the bold type to corroborate that it&#39;s Monotype Albion,
    I&#39;ll be happy to try and track them down, although they will be a bit more
    difficult to find. <BR> <BR>Also, there is some italic text scattered here and
    there, apparently from the same family, maybe it helps &#40;see 2nd and 3rd sample&#41;.
    Sorry the last sample is so jagged, my scanner is acting up. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Endre

  body: French Face Extended &#40;Jaspert &#39;Encyclopaedia&#39;&#41; is quite similar
    in most features, but I notice the serifs on the &#39;u&#39;  and &#39;m&#39;
    italic letters are not the same style. The Roman matches pretty well, and is the
    best match I have seen so far. I am still looking.

  body: Well, it was only my &#40;uneducated&#41; assumption that the italic and the
    roman belonged to the same family. Given the setter&#39;s choice to use a different
    bold type &#40;not only for headings but also for emphasis in the running text&#41;,
    I wouldn&#39;t put it entirely past them to have used a third face for italics.  <BR>
    <BR>Maybe some more italic samples will help to decide whether there&#39;s really
    significant difference in the serifs. <BR> <BR>However, please note that this
    is not urgent business -- I don&#39;t want to take up too much of your time. This
    is just personal curiosity on my part; as a reader, I find this particular Bible
    a masterpiece of readability &#40;and thus of typography&#41;, in particular when
    compared to some of its successors, and I wanted to take a look at the works behind
    it :-&#41;. <BR> <BR>Endre

  body: Actually, Mike, I think you&#39;re one page off. The next page in Jaspert
    shows a face called French Round Face that is an exact match &#40;taking ink spread
    into account&#41; to my eye. Every little quirk is there. Too bad the showing
    is so limited &#40;only letters and numbers in roman and italic&#41;.

  body: 'Here&#39;s what Mac McGrew &#40;American Typefaces of the Twentieth Century&#41;
    has to say about it: <BR> <BR>&#34;<b>FRENCH ROUND FACE</b> originally called
    <i>Didot Roman</i> or simply <i>Modern,</i> was one of the first revivals of the
    faces cut by Firmin Didot in France about 1784. This was cut for Monotype in 1910,
    under the direction of J. Horace MacFarland and William Dana Orcutt. The italic
    unusual in that some lowercase letters have serifs like the roman. No. 16 on Linotype
    and Intertype is similar but heavier. Compare <i>Suburban French.</i>'

  body: Your assumption is usually a good one, but I suppose nothing prevents a publisher
    from using any type that is legible at the required type sizes.  <BR> <BR>The
    biggest problem with italics is that they are often neglected in type specimen
    showings in popular books. <BR> <BR>I have finished looking through the Jaspert
    book, and I have found no better match than the French Face Extended which was
    a Monotype typeface.  <BR> <BR>One problem that we have had several times is that
    Central European types are not well known in the U.S., and my reference materials
    are rather limited on those typefaces. If these typefaces are not Western European
    or American, my chance of identifying it is very limited.  <BR> <BR>It appears
    that neither of the typefaces I mentioned exists by those names as digital type.
    If you do not have the Jaspert book, I would be happy to scan samples of Albion
    and French Face Extended. <BR> <BR>I am not optimistic that I will find the italic.
    Unless someone else on  this Board has better references for European typefaces,
    this may end up as a mystery we can&#39;t solve for you.   I know you said it
    was &#39;just personal curiosity&#39;, but that&#39;s often what motivates us
    to learn to identify these things, I think. <BR> <BR>Besides, questions about
    text type are relatively rare, and kind of fun to research. So I will look in
    a few more places, but I am running out of material to check.

  body: The bold weight is a bit mysterious. I don&#39;t see any references to a bold
    weight of French Round Face &#40;or any of its imitators&#41;. The Linotype version
    &#40;No. 16&#41; used Century Bold for bold.

    Somehow I missed that sample on the next page.  The serifs on that italic do match.
    <BR> <BR>So close, but no cigar! <BR> <BR>Good eye Mark.

  body: Thanks for your joint effort, folks, also for the quote from McGrew. <BR>
    <BR>I ordered Jaspert&#39;s Encyclopedia at Amazon. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately I don&#39;t
    have all information I would like on the Bible edition in question, but it seems
    to me that it&#39;s an unchanged reprint of a previous edition set in metal type
    &#40;metal setting is what an irregular baseline points to, or am I wrong?&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I know that the text hasn&#39;t changed since 1908 &#40;when it was published
    by the British and Foreign Bible Society&#41;, but it has probably been re-set
    a few times. <BR> <BR>As to the bold, I have included a few more samples in case
    it helps. But maybe I should open a new thread for that? <BR> <BR>Endre <BR><img

  body: I still think Albion Bold &#40;in the Jaspert book&#41; is the closest match
    I have seen, and it is still consistent with these new letters. The font is from
    Monotype in 1910. The typeface is odd in that the Bold has a different &#39;g&#39;
    than the regular weight. <BR> <BR>I will make a scan to show you while you wait
    for your copy.
