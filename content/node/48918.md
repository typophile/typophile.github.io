  documents. Do you guys have any recommendations on which cut/foundry of Helvetica
  is the best? There are so many. Would love to get any opinions.

  body: "A lot of people on here are slightly bitter about Helvetica for some reason
    they think they are above using it. That's ironic haha.\r\n[[http://www.spiekermann.com/mten/2008/04/helvetica_can_be_nice.html
    | Its what you can do with the design that will make the difference. ]]\r\n\r\nThere
    are a lot of good alternatives (in the link above) and some of them could work
    quite well.\r\nBut none of them are Helvetica, and none of them really could replace
    it (but yes they are alternatives), as you will get a different feel.\r\n\r\nUnivers
    & Helvetica are quite different, and you will get a different feel with both of
    them. Helvetica is warmer than Univers and has more character.\r\n\r\nBest Helvetica
    [[http://www.linotype.com/2048/neuehelveticapro.html | Helvetica Pro]]\r\n\r\nThe
    spacing is slightly better than others, as well as on-screen rendering (in Indesign
    anyway).\r\n\r\nAkkurat is a good modern alternative, but is quite different again.\r\n"

    me, I love Helvetica. If I was told that I could only use the Helvetica Neue family
    for the rest of my life, I'd be totally fine with that. But isn't switching from
    to Helvetica because you're bored with Univers kind of like switching to a Sanstone-colored
    car because you're bored with beige?\r\n\r\nHave you thought about moving towards
    something a bit more obviously different (Meta, or something like that)?"
