  body: ' thanks for the quick reply, Scoles.  I thought that was it, but I can&#39;t
    find the alternates used in this example or the &#34;AV&#34; variation used in
    the example or a &#34;TH&#34; variation I&#39;ve seen on posters.  Suggestions,
    anyone? '

  body: Though it&#39;s listed in their FontBook, I can&#39;t <BR>find the alternates
    and ligatures at fontshop.com. <BR>What I did find from Google was <A HREF="http://www.scangraphic.de/sc-avant.htm"
    TARGET="_top">Scangraphic&#39;s page</A>. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d also give FontShop
    a call and see if they <BR>are still selling it. Would be interested to hear <BR>what
    you find out. Thanks. <BR> <BR>Stephen
