body: "I'm redeveloping a wayfinding system for this building: The Pennsylvania Academy
  of Fine Arts ( http://www.pafa.org ) as a school project. I need to research typefaces
  that would be appropriate for the building signage and figured this would be the
  best place to get that help!\r\n\r\n<cite>The building, designed by the Philadelphia
  firm of Frank Furness and George Hewitt, is generally considered to be primarily
  the work of Furness who finished the project after the partnership dissolved in
  1875. Furness had been a pupil of Richard Morris Hunt who introduced him to the
  esthetics of the modern Gothic revival. This included John Ruskin's appreciation
  of the richly colored designs of 14th-century Venice, Owen Jones's and Christopher
  Dresser's Eastern influenced ornament, and Viollet le Duc's use of foliated decoration
  combined with cast-iron architecture.</cite>\r\n<cite>Rising 70 feet above the sidewalk,
  the Academy must have seemed a towering fortress in 1876. Today, dwarfed by more
  recent buildings, it looks like a decorated jewelbox. On the facade, heavy courses
  of dark stone rise toward a roofline marked with such colorful elements as red and
  black brick patterning, fanciful floral motifs, and a bas-relief frieze depicting
  famous artists of the past. A gothic window dominates the central pavilion and creates
  a motif that recurs inside.</cite>\r\n<cite>After entering through a low vaulted
  hall, the visitor steps into the spectacularly ornamented Grand Stairhall. Its staircase,
  bordered by richly tiled floor and walls, and bronze and mahogany banisters, sweeps
  upward to the gallery level. This grand space is ringed with gothic arches carrying
  gold rosette-studded walls. The vaulted ceiling above is painted a brilliant blue
  with silver stars. Beyond are the galleries where foliate columns support exposed
  steel beams, one of several radical design elements in the building.</cite>\r\n<cite>The
  Academy is considered one of the finest surviving examples of Victorian Gothic architecture
  in America. It provides the museum with a magnificent setting for the presentation
  of its collections and special exhibitions. As the modernist architect Louis I.
  Kahn observed, the Academy is truly a life-giving and inspired building.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
  brunt of the info is located in the archives page: http://pafa.org/archive.jsp\r\n\r\nI
  have access to a fairly large selection of Studio Fonts (420 families) plus my own
  little archive that I've started. I know it's going to be hard but I guess just
  suggest what you think would work and I'll try to find one that's hopefully similiar
  in quality with what I have. I don't suppose a foundry/designer might let me use
  a typeface for a specific educational project and then trash it.\r\n\r\nAny help,
  including just pointing me in the right direction would be great.\r\nThanks fellow
  Typophiles."

    This last one would be of most use in large sizes, and the MyFonts sample doesn''t

  body: well the old grotesques, in my mind, always have that little waft of... well,
    grotesqueness. I find the imperfections of some of these old faces to be what
    gives them charm as opposed to something that's been completely polished up like
    Aksidenz. Something from our library that fits into this category would be <a
    href="http://www.p22.com/ihof/stgschrift.html">St. G Schrift</a>, although i'm
    sure there are others that have the same kind of character. Perhaps this would
    be the perfect place for Maple?

  body: "Golden Cockerel is inappropriate -- Renaissance, not Gothic.\r\nSchrift is
    Jugendstil, much too late, as is Victorian Swash, although the Victorian Gothic
    might be OK in a secondary role (it's too thin for the lead)..\r\n\r\nYou really
    need a systematically fancy face to harmonize with the patterning in the building.\r\n\r\nIn
    this sample, you can see the highly formalized use of pattern that was a big part
    of Owen Jones' theory, so influential in the 3rd quarter of the 19th century.
    So I would imagine that any wayfinding system would, to be correct, have to have
    quite a substantial border, the design of which integrates with the typography.
    Why not take your cue from some feature of the decoration in the building?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NewDom.jpg]"

    decoration.\r\nTiffany is not authentic, in the sense that it's not a revival
    of any particular 19th century face.\r\nHowever, as has been noted, type would
    not have been used at display size then, so the very idea of a printed Victorian
    display/signage typeface is spurious. (Except perhaps for the British cast-iron
    street name signs, recently revived by Device, but in a distressed version.)\r\nSo
    to use a genuine display face, an original design drawn c.1970 by Ed Benguiat,
    a designer with amazing chops in decorative type design, in a very sympatico neo-vicky
    style, is a brilliant choice."

    and tried to put my own authentic spin on it. This was a school project as well
    and for that reason I couldn't go spend a great deal on a huge family. I'm quite
    pleased with the results though and your comments are appreciated! Many thanks
    to Paul Hunt though, and the P22 foundry for the Victorian family as it was a
    solid foundation in all my designs.
