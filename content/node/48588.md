  on a reference to the first known example of an orthographic symbol. I believe it
  was Greek.\r\n\r\nAny help?"

  body: Etymologically, the word orthography literally means 'correct writing', so
    probably originally applied to either correct spelling or the correct forming
    of letters. More recently, it has been used to refer to the set of written symbols
    used to write a particular language; as such, it is a conveniently neutral term
    that does not imply a particular kind of writing system.
