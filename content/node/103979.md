  Especially for Logo. Can anyone explain, why its so \"zeitgeisty\" to use these
  \"futuristic\" fonts? And what about the history? Its all from the beginning of
  computer technology?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    things, like radios, televisions, ball-point pens, nylon stockings, communications
    satellites, non-stick frying pans, and, last but not least, personal computers
    and even smartphones.\r\n\r\nSo, technology being seen as virtuous, advertisers
    seek to associate their products with this beloved source of boons."

    De Stijl period etc. so their history starts clearly before computers were en
    vogue.

    it with this "futuristic" Fonts.

  body: "\"Futura\", the canonical 'futuristic font', was designed \"in the summer
    of 1924\" (http://people.ku.edu/~delange/paulrenner.html).\r\n\r\nFrom that article:\r\n<blockquote>...
    it became a cornerstone of the \u201CNew Typography\u201D classified as Geometrical
    Modernism, form follows function became the key words and careful reasoning constrained
    all the character shapes to their utmost functional simplicity.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo
    apparently 'simplicity' is linked to 'futuristic'. Looking at FF QType, its design
    reminds me of 1970s computer monitors: straight lines (or only very subtly curved),
    with round corners. Could that be the subliminal link?\r\n\r\n\"Space Colony\"
    appears built with simple primitives, in an almost pixel-like fashion. Early 1960s
    futuristic fonts such as ITC's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/countdown_itc/\">Countdown</a>
    (1965) show similar characteristics.\r\n\r\nNow high-res screens have become available
    we might next see a backlash to classic serifed fonts -- just because it is possible
    :-)"

  body: "<img>http://astroprofspage.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/800px-nasa_worm_logo.png</img>\r\n\r\nCertain
    important logos help set the tone! Conceptually, unbroken curves suggest aerodymanics
    and speed, which go hand-in-hand with \"the future.\" which make them a perennial
    favorite for that purpose.\r\n\r\n Fonts more closely with specific technologies
    often look dated - the opposite of futuristic - after several years. I don't think
    anyone would call this: http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/computer futuristic,
    but at one time it certainly seemed that way. \r\n"

    many people think that we should abandon using it... perhaps \"in the name of
    love\"."

  body: "Many futuristic fonts \u2014 especially in movies \u2014\_are rather gimmicky,
    designed to look cool and different, but are unlikely to actually be used much
    in the future. One exception that comes to mind is 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which
    Kubrick resisted the urge to use \"futuristic\" fonts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2001_5460.jpg]"

  body: "Not <em>completely</em>. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4... which label the steps
    in the instructions are in a (somewhat) \"futuristic\" typeface; Microgramma,
    I believe.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest, the typeface <em>is</em> sans-serif, in fact,
    a geometric sans-serif (Futura!) so, while the typeface is conventional, it still
    avoids being <em>too</em> traditional."
