    mind? For example, FontLab uses the AFDKO source code internally so that users
    can output OT CFF fonts. But one can also only output a Type 1 font from FontLab
    and build the OT CFF with the standalone AFDKO."

    said: <em>\"Using the AFDKO source code internally\"</em>. But according to Adam,
    Fontforge generates OppenType PS (CFF) as well.\r\n\r\nIs there any difference
    (technically) in the fonts generated by the two programms?\r\nAnd what about \"error-checking\",
    does AFDKO has somekind of \"quality-check\" built-in to check curves and glyphs?
    Different from FontForge? Better? More industry-standard/compliant?\r\n\r\nBefore
    investing time and money in somekind of comparisson of the possibilities, I thought
    I'd better ask here first.\r\n\r\nArjen\r\n"

  body: "The AFDKO is a kit containing a set of tools for OpenType font development.
    The most notable of those tools is MakeOTF, which is the one that, provided with
    the necessary files, generates OpenType CFF fonts (.otf). I believe this is the
    code that FontLab and FontMaster carry under the hood.\r\nIn addition to MakeOTF,
    there are several other tools for tasks such as hinting, testing, and a few macros
    for FontLab. Here's a small list of some of the other tools included in the AFDKO:\r\n\r\nAutohint
    \u2014 for hinting PFA (Type 1) files. (It is also able to operate on OTF files,
    but it's not recommended as the resulting font won't be subroutinized, and thus
    will have a bigger file size)\r\nCheckOutlines \u2014 reports outline-construction
    errors. Can operate in PFA and OTF files.\r\nCompareFamily \u2014 reports problems
    found across a family of fonts (OTFs), and in each font individually. (AFAIK,
    this is the only font development tool in the world that checks the consistency
    of a font family).\r\nspot \u2014 reports the font\u2019s OpenType data. OT tables
    can be dumped to a text file, or shown graphically by generating a PostScript
    file.\r\ntx \u2014 for analyzing and converting the glyph-outline data of TrueType
    fonts and all OpenType font formats. It can output the results in several formats,
    including PDF.\r\n\r\nBrief explanation and usage examples of these tools is provided
    here:\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/TypoTechnica2007_FontProduction_at_Adobe.pdf\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/TypoTechnica2007_StateOfTheArt_Font_QE.pdf\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/QE_Outputs.pdf\r\n"

  body: "> <em>Better? More industry-standard/compliant?</em>\r\n\r\nThrough the AFDKO,
    Adobe makes publicly available the exact same tools that are used in-house for
    building and testing its fonts. What you or other parties eventually do with it
    won't necessarily be better or worse. The only guarantee is that whoever uses
    the AFDKO tools has the potential to make fonts as good as Adobe's (technically
    at least).\r\nDeciding for one tool or another will also depend on your workflow,
    platform, preferences, computer skills, needs, etc."

    AFDKO-generated OTFs into the .ttx format (xml representation of OTFs) and compare
    the tables' content. Ideally, you would use a FontForge-generated OTF as input
    for AFDKO, so you can compare what both tools do with 'the same font'.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "As to your quote from the Installation Guide, the non-bolded and the bolded
    sections refer to different parts of AFDKO.\r\nThe first: to the AFDKO which is
    an independent set of tools (MakeOTF, compareFamily, etc).\r\nThe second: to the
    (additional) macros for FontLab which must be run from within FontLab Studio and
    rely on FLS's own Python API and are supposed to modify FLS's font files -- so
    it is rather unlikely that these will work in FontForge."

  body: "'[...] I believe this is the code that FontLab and FontMaster carry under
    the hood. [...]'\r\n\r\nYes, the DTL FontMaster OpenType functionality is based
    on the SDK. A major difference with FontLab (you must correct me if I am wrong)
    is that the GSUB and GPOS features listed in the used features file(s) don't have
    to match the glyph set(s) for generating OT fonts. Features that are not covered
    by the characters in the outputted font are simply removed during generation.
    This way it is possible to use features files globally, i.e. for a complete library.
    New features can be added to a central features file and by generating all applicable
    OT fonts in batch, subsequently all these fonts will contain the new defined features.
    Or glyphs can be added to the databases and when covered by the features file
    re-generating the fonts will result in new features also.\r\n\r\nThe features
    files can also be used locally, i.e. per font and contain the necessary naming
    and metrics info for a particular font. When used globally in batch this info
    is taken from the UFM files belonging to the glyph databases (these are connected
    by file name). The kern info is taken then from an attached AFM or kern.fea file.
    Switching between the naming and metrics info in the features file and the information
    in the UFM and kern files can be done by adding a few lines at the end of the
    features files and subsequently activating or de-activating these."

    interface is not identical to FontLab's (I don't know how different they are,
    but George Williams generally avoids even looking at FontLab for intellectual
    property reasons). I've considered porting the AFDKO macros to FontForge, but
    it isn't particularly interesting work, and I don't need it myself (and I haven't
    heard of anyone else who would be interested until now).\r\n\r\nAnother issue
    for me is that the autohinting module (probably the most interesting part of the
    AFDKO) is contained in a Windows DLL (presumably the Mac version has the Mac equivalent),
    which I can't use in Linux, anyway, so the incentive is reduced.\r\n"
