  by\r\nsuggesting a typeface to a prog-rock cover I need to \r\nmake a concept for.\r\nThe
  client has supplied the attached image\r\nand if referring to the type at the top
  and the bottom.\r\nBut the cosmic type in the middle is amazing!\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  suggest a suitable face?\r\n\r\nThanks in adavance\r\n\r\nMr Brown"

    sent back \r\nthe cosmic thing that I posted.\r\nI agree with finding a lot of
    diversity but sometimes clients\r\ncan be real stick in the mud's \r\nfind something
    like this!\r\n[the swines]\r\nThanks for you suggestions\r\nI think I got that
    Cope thing somewhere\r\n\r\nMr Brown"

  body: "Faust IV is usually my suggestion for someone new to the genre. I've got
    little tolerance of guitar noodling. It is the pop sensibilities that shine through
    for me.\r\n\r\nI often read that Wayne Kramer was highly influenced by Faust.
    Not surprising.\r\n\r\nI've got a few of the Comic Jokers repressings that I appreciate
    as graphic design objects."

  body: "Get a bigger sample of covers. Look at Hawkwind, Amon D\xFC\xFCl II, Faust,
    Can, Ash Ra Tempel, etc. You will find much diversity in the work. Remember that
    this music sprang from a reverence for the velvets not American blues.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can find a copy of Julian Cope's Kroutrock Sampler take a look at that. It
    has lots of covers.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.amazon.com/Yeti-Amon-Duul-II/dp/B0009LNRLE/ref=pd_sim_m_1/105-4287604-9198064|Yeti]]
    is one of the classics and it is pretty clean.\r\n\r\n"
