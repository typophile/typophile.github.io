body: "Hello everyone \u2013 long time no see! Glad to be back on Typophile. I miss
  all of you! Long story short, I got married last June, moved to Hong Kong and now
  teaching at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (more updates later, I guess).
  \r\n\r\nNow \u2013 I\u2019m writing a proposal to seek funding to license a set
  of fonts for the school, mainly for the Visual Communication and Advertising disciplines.
  Right now we have an abysmal set of (mostly) default system fonts on our computers
  in the studios and labs, mostly PCs. I\u2019m tired of seeing the same fonts over
  and over again in students\u2019 projects. And we have next to nothing in terms
  of fonts with advanced features (multiple weights, 'pro' fonts, or fonts with \u2018expert
  sets\u2019, etc. we do have a few Adobe Pro fonts) for fine typographic work.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone here have experience in equipping a design school with fonts? Could you share
  your experience? I have a few font families that I have in mind. Ideally, I would
  like to have a set of 20-30 high quality, professional fonts. Some of which will
  be classic typefaces \u2013 several from each typeface category; some will be \u2018contemporary\u2019
  typefaces (really difficult to choose here). We also need some good Chinese text
  and display faces too. So, we\u2019ll have to license fonts from several different
  foundries.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve talked to two Chinese foundries and Adobe Hong Kong
  about this. None of them seem to offer volume discounts or education site licences.
  Both Chinese foundries charge a premium on PDF embedability, which is unrealistic
  for a school, since the students mostly just create PDFs for assignment submission.\r\n\r\nWe
  have around 300 computers in the school in total. We could implement this in phases
  to minimize cost upfront. I\u2019ve already written a \u2018justification\u2019
  for our need for fonts. But I\u2019m having a hard time working out the budget for
  this.\r\n\r\nAny advice on this? Or recommendations for what I should include in
  the set of fonts?"

  body: "I attend and work at a medium-sized privately-funded liberal arts college.
    Our Art and Design department has 38 macs in classrooms and a handful of laptops
    for faculty use. A little while ago, the department decided to update our aging
    typeface collection by purchasing 45 licenses for the Adobe Opentype folio, in
    addition to 45 licenses for a few extra typefaces that were deemed hip by the
    faculty (Meta2 OT, Mrs Eaves OT, Matrix, HFJ's Requiem). \r\n\r\nIn my estimation,
    this was a gross miscalculation. I spend about an hour a week clearing sometimes
    problematic fonts from dafont.com and elsewhere (Eduardo Recife of Misprinted
    Type fame is apparently a local hero) out of the folders where we keep the Adobe
    collection (We use Linotype Font Explorer X). A cursory glance at the student
    work reveals that there is very little use of the display faces included with
    the Adobe folio, and sparing use of everything else. I think this can be blamed
    mostly on instructor leniency, which runs rampant here, but I still can't help
    but wonder if it would have been more economical to purchase a handful of licenses
    for the Adobe Type for Learning folio and install them on only a few computers.
    \r\n\r\nPersonally, as a student, I think the majority of so-called grunge fonts
    are very dated. They are appearing on stuff in Walmart and besides, if you want
    a grungy look it's way more fun to produce it yourself, digitally or otherwise.
    Also, I would have liked to see something like the Umbrella Selects collection
    from Veer thrown into the mix. There are some inclusions in the adobe collection
    that are downright questionable\u2026 Hobo Std? Come on.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to get
    back to your question... I think it is really important to come to a consensus
    with the instructors. If you're going to invest funds into purchasing professionally
    developed typefaces, then there should be some encouragement from the faculty
    to use the fonts. \r\n\r\nI think I'm starting to ramble on here, but I just thought
    I'd share my experiences. "

  body: "Keith,\r\n\r\nRather than license a set of fonts for the school, what is
    the price point for your students to purchase their own font licenses? How many
    students are there? Making the purchases of a particular set of fonts a requirement
    would go a long towards getting the discounts you are looking for. \r\n\r\nIf
    I had a couple of hundred students who were required to license a collection of
    fonts from me every semester, you bet I'd work out a nice price. But a one-time
    license to a design college, where I know they will be pirated and copied for
    the next ten years, no thanks.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "James, to some extent, yes. That's why there's a huge market for used books,
    students share books, etc. The advantage that books still have over fonts though
    is simply expectation: due to precedent, ease of copying, whatever, people expect
    to have to pay for books more than fonts. I'm not talking about celebrating that
    or even being defeatist about it, I'm talking about not handicapping students
    too much by being stubborn about it. If you treat kids like you don't trust them,
    when they grow up they'll chew you up.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think I've put forward an interesting licensing model here. Students are
    required to purchase all sorts of things when the attend school. A package of
    useful fonts that they will use throughout their school years and beyond should
    be one of those things. Different than books in that the fonts function as ongoing
    tools in their design practice. I don't see how a design student is going to think
    this is something they do not need. (They may think that this is something they
    don't have to pay for, but teaching that is not true is part of the university's
    mandate)\r\n\r\nThe point from a font makers perspective is creating a market.
    If every incoming freshman purchases a font pack, the incentive is there to offer
    those font packs at an attractive price. \r\n\r\nWhat the chew on when they grow
    up is up them."

  body: "James, your model actually makes a lot of sense, but I think it would work
    the best when we have some sort of a \u2018laptop program\u2019 in place, where
    students are required to purchase a laptop with a set of manadatory software before
    entering the program.\r\n\r\nYes, font priacy is rampant in many schools, and
    I know tutors who actually hand out unlicensed fonts to students. I think this
    is more due to the lack of education in this. Some students dont\u2019t actually
    realize that fonts are like software applications and need to be licensed. I\u2019ve
    been teaching for almost four years now and I really tried hard to educate my
    students about font licensing. Some (not all) have licensed fonts for their own
    use, even when they are still students. But most just cannot afford to pay for
    expensive licenses when they work on school assignments. They often research for
    a suitable font and pick one that they really really want to use, only to find
    that it is not something that they could afford, and end up using some freeware
    knockoff, system font, or the several fonts that come with Creative Suite. Or
    resort to priated copies that they circulate around.\r\n\r\nBut we have to face
    the reality that the current font licenesing model is not the best. Students need
    lots of fonts to closely study them and learn to work with them. Just relying
    on system fonts does not do the trick. In fact, I believe that all designers should
    have access to all available fonts before they make a committment to purchasing
    a license. A license to <em>use</em> rather than to <em>own</em>, perhaps. Would
    that be possible? It'd be difficult to find a way for this to work."

  body: "I think the laptop model would be good. It could work with James's idea too.
    It would simply be a matter of the school licensing the fonts to go with the laptops.
    When the student purchases the laptop they then register the fonts with the foundry
    so the foundry can know who holds license #25467.\r\n\r\nThe initial cost would
    go to the school and you'd have to find a foundry willing to transfer license
    ownership. But I'd think this really should work.\r\n\r\nGlad to hear the news

    school where I work (AUT, Auckland NZ) did a deal with Linotype in 2006 for a

    Gold Edition 1.7.</a> I'm not entirely sure, but I think the deal was finally
    sealed on the price Linotype were able to offer \u2013 the decision had been argued
    over by a number of competing interests within the school, including the need
    for 'classic' and 'contemporary' fonts, but sadly there was no Chinese dimension
    to this.\r\n\r\nPersonally if I had to do the process all over again, I would
    take up your suggestion here for an individual/laptop licensing model. Students
    simply don't value what they haven't had to pay for themselves \u2013 and they
    don't evaluate critically the font choices that they see on a server stuffed with
    what they erroneously presume to be thousands of free fonts.\r\n"

  body: "In my Typography 2 class, each student was required to purchase one typeface.
    It could be an entire family or just a single, but they had to use it for one
    of their projects (rather than just buying the cheapest font they could find and
    then not actually using it). They were told this at the very beginning of the
    semester so they could budget for it, if need be.\r\n\r\nBy this point in their
    schooling, they were on the track to becoming graphic designers, so this experience
    was relevant to their future careers. The school had purchased the entire Adobe
    library, so they did have another ready and rich pool of legal typefaces to choose
    from. In other words, buying their typeface was a supplement and a learning experience
    rather than a desperate need.\r\n\r\nWe discussed in class both licensing issues
    and issues to consider when making a purchase. They really learned quite a bit
    by going through the process of choosing, buying and using a typeface. For example,
    they would find out that their typeface didn't have the right character set they
    needed or they had chosen the wrong typeface, but already paid for it (this hit
    home the typeface-as-investment angle!). Many learned what a pleasure it is to
    work with a quality typeface of their choosing and what a difference it makes
    on a project. And so on.\r\n\r\nIt the right circumstances, students purchasing
    typefaces is a great learning experience and one they will engage in often as
    professionals. We ask them to buy all sorts of things... books, print outs, paint
    supplies, drawing pens, and so forth, why not fonts.\r\n\r\nA little off topic
    now, but\u2026\r\n"

      student to license a typeface is a very good idea. It would be a very educational
      experience for them. My worry is some students might not have credit cards which
      would make it very difficult to buy online, and it does seem like the only option
      in Hong Kong as we don't have any local foundries here.\r\n\r\nThomas, I called
      the main distributer of Adobe in Hong Kong and they don't seem to have a clue
      about fonts. I did mention Type Classics for Learning to the person I talked
      to and I don't think he has ever heard of it. Font Folio would be great, but
      would it be prohibitedly expensive? We would like to license fonts from other
      foundries as well.\r\n\r\nChinese fonts are a big problem! Even the most basic
      set from Monotype cost 300K+ (HK$) for 300 computers. This set only contains
