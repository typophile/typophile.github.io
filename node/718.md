  cool way. It rhymes the last names of font personalities with a word that kinda
  relates to the person - see if you can figure out all the &#34;jokes&#34;! &#40;Some
  of them are pretty weak, though.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, I was keeping this to myself
  to use for some grand occasion, but figured to share it here instead. So feel free
  to use it or abuse it.&#41; <BR> <BR>---- <BR> <BR>Aicher&#39;s Bunkers <BR>Caflisch&#39;s

    \"v\"s in there! Or maybe the \"u\" in \"Mosquito\", since people could figure
    it out.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
