  body: The b and p with the slight open space in the bowl is the most interesting
    part, It makes it work really well at small sizes. If you plan on turning this
    into a full family, you might want to make a Display weight with closed bowls
    for these characters. The top of the q's stem seems a bit too thin, there might
    be a better way to resolve this than having a stem extending up. Although I think
    the z on its own is pretty cool, it might be a bit too unique for this typeface.
    Overall, it has a really nice texture, even though the kerning isn't quite there
    (which means this typeface has even more potential!)
