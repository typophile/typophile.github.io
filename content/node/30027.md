  body: I've seen this before. I think it means that InDesign hasn't finished creating
    all the preview "Sample" strings for the font menu. If you delete the Adobe font
    caches, you will see lots of them. Eventually they all change to "Sample" in the
    appropriate font, although I notice that sometimes they get stuck.
