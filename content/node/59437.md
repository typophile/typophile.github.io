  body: "The double-l ligature could certainly have been done in a font, but the two
    y's (from \"by\" and \"Library\") also seem different, and they should be the
    same if this were a font. \r\n\r\nWhat is the publication date? If it's before
    the mid-1980's it pretty much rules out a digital font, even for the serif text.\r\n\r\n-

  body: It's lovely lettering, indeed. Won't get too close with type. If you like
    the 'A', <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/rimmer/rtf_stern_pro_ot/">RTF
    Stern's</a> is similar. For inline scripts, see <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/genres/inline_script/">this
    list</a>.

  body: thanks for all the suggestions.. i did a search on the publication date and
    found that there were a couple of editions which i founded printed with these
    fonts, namely the 1946 ed and the 1986 ed.. =)
