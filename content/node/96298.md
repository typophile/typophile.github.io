body: 'Hi, so I''m in charge of running the assassins game for my residence this year
  (it''s a real life thing, not a video game or anything, you can probably look it
  up if you want) and I have to make promotional posters. The place has quite a strong
  sense of tradition so it would be best if I could use as much of the original fonts,
  posters, etc as possible. Anyway, to do this they gave me all the old materials
  they had, including last year''s promotional posters however they neglected to give
  me the special font they used to make them, which is a problem as I need to update
  them for this year and I''m having trouble contacting last year''s guy. I know he
  got them off the internet, possibly from dafonts.com, but that''s as much as I know.
  Any help you could give would be hugely appreciated, thanks! '

  body: I have, I looked all through the horror section, and a few others. I was just
    hoping someone here might know where it comes from and  could save me some time
    since other than looking at everything they have I'm all out of ideas.

  body: Awesome, thank you so much. It's funny, the guy actually thought it might
    have had blue in the title so I searched that and nothing came up since it's all
    one word. Oh well, thanks again!

    the fact that the different color means it's a link?\r\nLook at the font. You
    need a sledgehammer. Like so:\r\nLINK ---> http://www.dafont.com/angryblue.font?fpp=50&text=ASSASINR\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
