body: "dear friends typophiles!\r\ni am glad to present you new Arsenal contrast sans
  typeface. the project wins the contest for ukrainian font by <em>Mystetsky Arsenal</em>
  foundation and <em>Stairfors</em> design studio (some info in english about it you
  can find [[http://www.day.kiev.ua/221352|here]] and [[http://www.day.kiev.ua/220116/|here]]).
  \r\nso now it is typefamily of four fonts, released under OFL for free download.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ars01_4625.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ars02_5803.png]\r\ninteresting
  that it includes few unusual historic alternates for cyrillic letters (like latin-looking
  <em>f</em> with double bar for <em>\u0444</em> or round form for <em>\u044F</em>)
  from old ukrainian origins.\r\n\r\nplease get the files at <strong>[[http://www.ukrainian-type.com/]]</strong>,
  also here is project page on [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Arsenal-free-typeface/5540223|behance]].
  \r\n\r\nthank you for watching!"
