    Paper Works]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Emily_Lime|Emily Lime]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Debi_Sementelli_Type_Foundry|Debi

    But the more I look at it now, the more I think it's all hand-lettered. No duplicated
    letter is actually identical.\r\nBut you could fairly approximate it using 3 Great
    Lakes Lettering:\r\n- for the script: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/great-lakes-lettering/asterism|Asterism]]
    (Dasha, Ondise, Dahra, Bombshell, Jacques and Gilles, Peoni, Cantoni, Gemmadonati...)\r\n-
    for the uppercase oblique serif: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/great-lakes-lettering/saint-agnes|Saint
    Agnes]]\r\n- for the uppercase oblique sans: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/great-lakes-lettering/frosted|Frosted]]"
