  for my business logo. But it isn't, and I don't, so I can't. That said, I'm looking
  for a typeface with a handwritten feel that's airy (but not too thin-- medium weight
  would be ideal) and cheerful but not childish. I've spent hours digging through
  MyFonts.com but I haven't come up with something that's <i>quite</i> what I'm after.
  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ajw-design.net\">Here's</a> an example of my current
  logo. I don't hate it, but my biggest problem with that typeface is the long descender
  on the J-- it's a pain to design around, so I'm looking for something with a descender
  that's shorter or on more of an angle. I get the feeling that might be a tall order,
  though. Curse my inconvenient initials!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    font as you and duplicate it just by typing your initials, it's not really a logo,
    is it? Try sketching what you want and then tracing over it in Illustrator. Or,
    outline a font that's close and adjust the outlines. Or, use a digital tablet
    to draw the lettering. Or, hire a lettering artist to work with you.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

  body: "I agree with Joshua that custom lettering would be better. But here's an
    example of a \"j\" with a short descender that can be tucked under the \"a\" (although
    I don't think this particular font is suitable for your purpose):\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/sugar-pie/"

  body: "@joshua After a few dozen iterations of this logo, I'm starting to agree
    that I'll have to hire a lettering artist. When I did my first version of the
    logo long ago I did indeed attempt to draw/trace my own signature, but it didn't
    go well simply because my handwriting does not a good logo make. It so happens
    that a friend of mine does lettering and she offered to work with me when I mentioned
    my difficulties, so I'm hoping I'll finally have a version of my logo I actually
    like!\r\n\r\n@JamesM Thanks! I almost used Sugar Pie, but it was a little too
    cartoony. Though it suits <a href=\"http://www.ajw-art.com\">my illustration style</a>,
    I'm going for a look that's fun but still professional. I wish I could think of
    a good example. As Joshua suggested, I'm near the point where I'll have to contract
    this out. "

    signature was actually created by one of his artists.\r\n\r\n\r\n> [Sugar Pie]
    was a little too cartoony\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, I wasn't recommending that
    you use that font; it was just an example of how a J can be constructed with a
    short descender."
