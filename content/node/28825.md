  work on a gallery signage system to be implemented within the next few weeks but
  being quite a fairly high profile job (for me) I wanted to get things right.\r\n\r\nI've
  picked out quite a selection of faces to use, but the illustrator seems to have
  taken a fancy to 'Beta Sans' by Shiftype.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to find out what
  you guys made of it, and if you knew any reason why using the face is a terrible
  idea..and so on...\r\n\r\n"

    'Beta' for on screen type and actually I think it works really well. And it looks
    way fresher and nicer than whatever else is shown on TV. So I think it 'could'
    sure work for signage as well.\r\n\r\nDav"

    advive as to the appropriateness of the Beta Sans. \r\n\r\nFrom an initial glance,
    I find the lowercase e and lowercase g charmingly disgusting."

    and gallery title (caps).\r\n\r\nAhh well meeting at 11, have to see what they
    make of it "
