  body: "I think it is custom lettering, even though those two 's' shapes look very
    close. The lettering style could be Sudtipos (Koziupa/Paul) or TypeSetit (Rob
    Leuschke), to name sources that also produce fonts, but of course, many artists
    could have done the lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I should also have included Jukebox Fonts (Jason Walcott) at Veer, but looking
    at fonts from all three, the Sudtipos designs seem more similar. \r\n\r\nLesser
    known sources perhaps could be Art and Sign (Signfonts), SignDNA,  and Letterhead
    Fonts, all of which use the work of talented lettering artists to produce a collection
    of fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I rather tend towards thinking it's a font; i, r and n are quite similar too
    (the ft is obviously a ligature). Andreas

    looks like the designer murdered the kerning on the letters Jan pointed out. Ouch!"

    butchered the setting. Besides the \"ne\" colliding, the s was enlarged and the
    t is floating in the air for no reason. \r\n\r\nHurts to see this!\r\nStephen"
