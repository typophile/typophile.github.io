body: I&#39;ve really appreciated the advice &#40;and the willingness to give it out&#41;
  I&#39;ve been given here at typophile, the instructional websites have been a real
  help.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a good, all-inclusive book that covers
  the basics of type-aesthetics &#40;there are many general graphic design books out
  there, but I&#39;ve not come across any that deal specifically with the elements
  of things like letter proportioning--especially things like capital O extending
  slightly beyond the cap and baselines&#41;.  Where can I find a book of visual rules/tricks
  for type, perceptual psychology stuff?

  body: Huh, I&#39;d missed this. <BR>You&#39;ll find short snippets dealing with
    this in various type books &#40;like Doyald Young&#39;s &#34;Fonts &amp; Logos&#34;&#41;,
    but the one book I&#39;ve found that has the most amount of juiciest stuff is
    &#34;Perception and Imaging&#34; by Richard Zakia. That&#39;s where I first learned
    about notan, among other things. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
