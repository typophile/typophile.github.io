  body: "I'm the owner of Eight Arms Cellars and made The Tentacle. Glad you like
    the label. Here is a review from The Rhone Report on how the wine tastes:\r\n\r\n\"Straight
    up delicious and a fantastic value, the 2008 Eight Arms Cellars Syrah The Tentacle
    has upfront, fruity aromas of freshly crushed berries, baking spices and dried
    flowers. Medium bodied with racy acidity, dusty tannin, and a supple, easy nature,
    this will be crowd pleaser over the next year or three.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    it is sold out, but the 2009 vintage will be available in late spring."
