  needs replicate the historical look of the building's original signage. Unfortunately,
  documentation of the original signage does not exist. Has anyone ever seen this

  body: 'Thanks for the suggestions. I was looking at Futura Display, but Mayo matches
    a lot better. I think Oxide was matched to the "Amazon", no? Sorry, should have
    specified that I was trying to match the architectural letters. Good match though! '

  body: No, I'd say Oxide matches "CLEANERS". You could also look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=refrigerator&x=0&y=0">Refrigerator</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/AgencyFB">Agency</a>.

  body: You won't be able to match these letters with a font because letters like
    these were designed specifically for each use by the sign maker. You can get close
    with some of these fonts, but there is no duplicate. Also look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_motel_gothic/">FF
    Motel Gothic</a>.
