body: Thanks in advance. Looking for something similar to this type. Art deco-ish
  i guess. the low cross bar on the A, etc. But doesnt need to be this condensed necessarily.
  Thank you.   -m[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heavy_5466.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/light_3877.jpg]

  body: "\r\nThanks. I think it actually is Mostra. That's funny.  Neutraface is a
    good call. It's a pretty pricey one but very nice. Can you think of anything else
    remotely similar? Thanks so much."
