body: "Hi all -- I've been tasked at my job to come up with a building signage package
  for a project we're working on. My type skills are a bit rusty and I could use some
  thoughts. The only lettering on the building is shown in this photo. It's cast metal
  lettering done in the late 1920s. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Door_6052.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  see it as a sort of middle ground between a serif and a sans-serif, slightly whimsical
  but clean and modern. The building has very clean lines and few ornaments. Our historican
  calls it the \"half-modern\" style.\r\n\r\nMy sense is that this type over the door
  should be singular and all signage should pay respects to this without mimicry.
  I've been looking at modern, clean, sans-serifs for the majority of the signage.
  Most of the signs will be regulatory and identifying (tenant names, room identification,
  stairwell identification, etc.) but there may be some lengthier \"exhibit\" signage
  which talks about the history of the building. For that, I've been considering a
  serif header with sans-serif body but maybe the reverse would be best.\r\n\r\nIn
  any case, would love some brainstorms on fonts that you feel \"go\" with this sign.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nAmanda"

  body: "Hey, is that downtown Portland? I remember when the Meier & Frank store was
    still around. \r\n\r\nIf you want something very close to that lettering then
    you might try Tobias Frere-Jones's Grand Central:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GrandCentral\r\n\r\nSame
    period flavor. But might be too close without being identical, and therefore a
    clash. \r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oops! Scooped by Stewf. Took too long typing."

  body: "Oh, that Grand Central is beautiful!\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm looking for
    complementary fonts as well. I've found that some beautiful sans-serif fonts look
    a little too sterile and others look a little too whimsical so any good ideas
    there would be welcome. \r\n\r\nHey, kentlew -- yes, in Portland but not the downtown
    location, it's in Northwest."

  body: "A \"high-waisted\" sans serif of similar vintage, such as Venus, recently
    remade by dberlow as <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Vonness\">Vonnes</a>,
    would certainly give you enough styles to play with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: That's a great one, Nick. Too bad it's not yet available (I've emailed to
    find out when). I really like your detail about "high waisted" -- that might be
    something I can look for in a match and would not have thought of otherwise.

    Petite</a> or <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/Anisette">Anisette</a>
    be too modern?

  body: "Something about that Venus is not as appealing to me. Maybe I like the rounded
    letters more in Vonnes? It has a nice balance and rhythm to it.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the other suggestions, I think Anisette is too contemporary and Binner Gothic
    too memorable and distinctive. This face needs to step back a bit and also be
    timeless."
