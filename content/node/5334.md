body: I have a couple of font families where each weight &#40;light, regular, semibold,
  bold, black&#41; has the same family name, but separate menu names with only the
  italics linked to the romans. <BR> <BR>For one of the font families all the fonts
  have the weight set to Normal or Regular, even for the Bold and Black fonts. For
  another family the weight is Light for the light fonts and Semibold for the semibold
  fonts, with the rest set to Normal. <BR> <BR>I believe that ATM &#40;Windows&#41;
  sees a font as bold if the weight is set to Bold or Black, even if the Bold bit
  isn&#39;t set, and I guess that this is the reason to these somewhat confusing weight
  settings where Black is set to Regular. <BR> <BR>What is the recommended way of
  setting the weight of fonts? And what is the difference between using Regular, Normal
  and Roman for weight and style? <BR> <BR> <BR>Rasmus Bruun, <BR>Denmark
