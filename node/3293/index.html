  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">okay, so i know that Mr. Frederick Nader is rather infamous on these forums, but i was cruising all my old font links today and noticed that he had a rather interesting article up on apostropic lab's website here: <a href="http://www.hardcovermedia.com/lab/articles/ot.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.hardcovermedia.com/lab/articles/ot.htm">http://www.hardcovermedia.com/lab/articles/ot.htm</a></a> <BR>i was wondering if there had already been some discussion along these lines (since i'm new to these forums) that anyone could point me to. I think Mr. Nader makes some interesting assertions and would love to read some further commentary on the topics addressed in this article. (oh, and if you want a laff, check out the article on how many font designers it takes to change a light bulb, hilarious!)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What do I think of the article? I think that those readers who enjoy recreational drugs should ask him to share, since obviously he's got some pretty powerful stuff. <BR> <BR>Many of the assertions in this article are simply factually false, and many others are misleading at best. Plus he's got some axes to grind. The combination makes it pretty absurd. There are a couple of other folks out there who operate in a similar alternate universe, but luckily none of them are all that prominent. <BR> <BR>I seem to recall that there are some perfectly good points as well in there, but it's hard to distinguish them from the rubbish. I suppose I could go through it again&hellip; (shudder). <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">LOL, I was hoping you would enlighten me, Thom, on which points were valid! The part that intrigued me, I guess, was the artist vs. the programer notion, just simply because i'm not much of either! I realize that Mr. Nader's philosophy &amp; practices run contrary to the majority, but i was hoping for some level headed discussion about some of the issues he addresses, i realize that this article is written as a propaganda (just check out that closing line!) but can i just have some commentary on this to help sort out the facts sans the drama. (I hate drama, unless it's a good classic tragedy) So no name calling! I just want the facts and some good solid opinions. Or is that too much to ask?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh, fine, I'll dissect the article. <BR> <BR>First off, it's certainly true that with the *current* state of OpenType development tools, it takes a moderately technical mindset to develop feature-ful OpenType fonts with lots of goodies. <BR> <BR>That being said, one of the beauties of OpenType is that it frees the type designer from the arbitrary character set and encoding constraints of Type 1 and TrueType (though at least TrueType had more flexibility on the language support side). Speaking as a designer, if I want to throw in just one extra ligature or a couple of alternate characters or whatever into my font, I can. <BR> <BR>The new technology doesn't remove the critical role of the type designer any more than any other type technology has done. To be sure there is a new kind of technical type development role, for people who know how to make OpenType features work, but the general category of technical type development roles as distinct from type designers has existed for at least a century, perhaps more. <BR> <BR>On to other stuff, from the top&hellip;. <BR> <BR> <BR>I disagree with Nader's opinion of how &quot;the user&quot; is the lowest common denominator and is responsible for the degradation of technologies and typography. If this were true, each technology would go downhill from the time of its introduction (created by engineers and designers) until being replaced by something else. In fact, each technology has generally improved steadily, being ever refined, until replaced by something else that offers some significant advantages, even though the new tech has some rough edges. Those rough edges are generally fixed over time. The first DTP was pretty bad in some ways, mostly due to resolution limitations. But it improved. <BR> <BR>Nader claims that OpenType makes it possible to do &quot;things like report usage statistics to the manufacturer through online connections, keep logs of certain things, conduct machine surveys, enforce usage parameters, and all kinds of actions that some people might consider malicious, intrusive, or reckless.&quot; <BR> <BR>This is almost entirely untrue. The only &quot;usage parameter&quot; existent in OpenType that I can think of is the fsType embedding bit, which specifies the type developers' desires as far as how the fonts can be embedded. This is present in TrueType as well, so is not new to OpenType. The rest as far as I know is pure fantasy, but to whatever extent it is true it would be true only of TrueType flavored OpenType, and only to the exact same extent it's true of TrueType. <BR> <BR>&quot;Open Type technology itself is in fact so open that it is certainly possible to place a viral element inside a font, or make the font activate or deactivate system modules or, as has already been proven, even cause a machine to restart itself no matter what tasks are running or which work has been saved.&quot; <BR> <BR>Again, this is largely nonsense. Until recently, it was possible to make a font in any major format (Type 1, TrueType, OpenType with either kind of outlines) that would cause Windows to blue screen or reboot. These security problems have been solved. However, there was nothing &quot;viral&quot; about it, it was simply bad fonts that could cause crashes. No self-replication or infection of any sort. Also nothing particularly unique to OpenType. <BR> <BR>However, I do think that Nader is largely right that if user's expectations go way up, it will be hard on type designers who have to produce a lot more glyphs. Today's better tools will reduce the time to add more glyphs, but it's still a noticeable extra amount of work. It is not clear to me that this change will happen, as there are an awful lot of existing typefaces that do not have tons of extra goodies, and many of those don't particularly need to be extended to a bigger glyph complement. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>I mostly disagree about the comments about IP. These are at most extensions to existing works, not clones or knockoffs. The comparisons made here are inappropriate. <BR> <BR>Nader's claims about Lithos are misleading at best, as Carol was personally involved in the extensions to her design. The &quot;figure variations&quot; are not oldstyle figures, but simply smaller versions of the full-size figures, to go with the small caps. Adobe does generally credit the people who do major extensions to typefaces, which is why Myriad Pro now lists Fred Brady and Christopher Slye, who did the Myriad Pro Cyrillic and Greek coverage (respectively) with Robert Slimbach as art director. <BR> <BR>I agree that as type tech advances there have been tradeoffs and we've had to give up things to gain other things. But what almost always happens is that some of those things that have been sacrificed are able to come back as the next generation of technology improves. <BR> <BR>The speculation that the &quot;underground&quot; might somehow as a group tend to outdo the above-ground developers in typographic innovation is pretty laughable to me. After all, the average shareware font has significantly less than a full Win-ANSI or MacRoman character set. Probably a few people will do some very cool stuff, but the existence of cool technology won't change the average state of shareware. How many superhinted TrueType fonts have you seen as shareware? <BR> <BR>The last section (&quot;what are we sacrificing?&quot;) is pretty fantastical to my mind, and hardly worth commenting on. <BR> <BR>So, those are my thoughts. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

I see nothing wrong with that.  <BR> <BR>It has also made some of the minutiae of typography a little easier. I also see nothing wrong with that.

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald: <BR> <BR>Yes, font format specs are incomprehensible to normal humans. This is unfortunate, but does not doom the font formats. The part you are quoting is a part of the OpenType spec that is also part of the older TrueType spec. This density of programmer-speak did not stop TrueType from being successful. The Type 1 spec is only a little better, not much. Have you tried reading it? <BR> <BR>&gt; Also I get sick of hearing how you simply insert tab &quot;a&quot; into hole &quot;b&quot; and voila! <BR> <BR>Sometimes that's how it works, at the normal-person level of explanation. If you want to understand it at the programming level you will have to put some real time and effort into understanding the underlying technologies. Maybe start by attending some of the workshops and seminars that keep on happening at ATypI and other venues. <BR> <BR>&gt; By the way can you send me a sample of Adobe's Finnish version of accents? That would put my mind to rest. <BR> <BR>Why? The question of whether anyone will bother to do such culturally-sensitive work is quite independent from what is or is not enabled by the technology. <BR> <BR>The main case like this I can point to at Adobe is that all of our Cyrillic fonts have italics where three or four characters have quite different alternate forms for Serbian than for other Cyrillic languages. The fonts use the locale feature to specify these alternates. <BR> <BR>I believe that Adam Twardoch has used the locale feature to create various language-specific accent forms in some fonts he's worked on. But you should ask him on that score. <BR> <BR>As for optical size, there's no question that the multiple master solution was the best one going in digital typesetting. It's a shame that OpenType's 'size' feature is not nearly as versatile, and requires separate fonts. You won't get any argument from me that OpenType has the best solution in this area. I will say that it's better than nothing, and that Adobe's type group continues to care about optical size scaling. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, <BR> <BR>Good morning from Finland. <BR> <BR>You said <i>I never dismissed any language as trivia. Adobe has not yet done language-specific accent variants, but that does not mean it will not do so in the future.</i> <BR> <BR>Well, it is a problem, that and licensing. To be honest I have not adjusted <i>Finnish accents.</i> I don't know what to do with them. There is not much you can do with two dots other than make them smaller, or bigger, or move them up down, over, closer or wider between. Those small adjustments make a big difference. <BR> <BR>Had the Finnish artisans completed, or where not over ridden by foreign influences their alphabet was taking a life of it very own. The second <i>upper case A</i> was not defined by two dots, (I hate to use the right name, you understand) <i>but became an upright Italic lowercase a.</i> That was the direction their alphabet was taking. The <i>uppercase</i> was early traditional classical <i>roman,</i> very remarkable work by the way. <i>&quot;Pre-printing&quot;</i> in structure. There was no lowercase. However, strangely there was a complete upright italic, <i>&quot;printing in structure&quot;</i> Aldine in considerations. <BR> <BR>But let me back up a bit. The G, was no more than a C with a very kerned &quot;small cap (i) &quot; next to it. I don't know Finnish, what I do know is they have trouble with the G's in my name. <BR> <BR>How did the original model for the alphabet find its' way to Finland? I am not speaking of the transition, I am speaking of the original forms, which are intact. Some thoughts are promoted for instant consideration. Sailing, the Finns are swarthy seamen for sure. Foreign occupation. And others. What others? The Church, sleigh, skiis, skates. Not an easy exercise because remember, the <i>roman</i> without the <i>lowercase,</i> the <i>italic fully developed.</i> That indicates separate influences. <BR> <BR>The <i>roman with no lowercase</i> indicates very early, as does the upright Aldine Italic, but later.  <i>(I use Aldine to describe.)</i> Dutch Foundry Italics leaned towards a sloping italic, which sailed its way to influence the English, hence the very sloping Caslon italic.  <BR> <BR>The italic I speak of is not of Dutch influence. <BR> <BR><b>Transitional Influence</b> <BR> <BR>What is the influence for the Finnish <i>&quot;transitional introductions to the alphabet?&quot;</i> Dare I suggest, the <i>&quot;Finnish mother tongue&quot;.</i> <BR> <BR>I was very honoured to have found the Ramsay Stones. For me it was like walking through a language, alphabet cathedral. The stones covered a period of time, illustrating within walking distance, an orderly sequence of transitional development. All dated.  <BR> <BR>Also if you have any thoughts these works were work of inferior hands you would be delighted to see how wrong you would be. Especially one  them. The work is exemplary. <BR> <BR>This is truly a transitional phase I am speaking of, independent of any I have seen elsewhere. Furthermore, it would have better suited the Finnish language. <BR> <BR>This is why I seem so fanatical about languages maintaining independence <BR> <BR>The French find sacred things in their spoken language, they find merit in Garamond. Quebec has language police. Jail time for abusers. <BR> <BR>I see nothing wrong with that. <BR> <BR>So for me, I would rather go back and pick up where the Finnish artisans left off. Since only an <i>uppercase roman</i> exists, but they were introducing <i>italic lowercase</i> forms for variable sounds, the same approach would probably have resulted in reverse when they got around to a lowercase roman. That is my guess, or where I would have taken it. <BR> <BR>Rather than bump dots around. But that is just me. <BR> <BR>In any event, had I viewed the Ramsay Stones first, Bodoni 26 would have looked much different. <BR> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni26.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni26.html">http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni26.html</a></a> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I do recommend following the link back to the original discussion, since my full post (Oct 8 2003) also discussed the compatibility/information issue, which I think was also significant. <BR> <BR>Gerald: <BR> <BR>The optical size feature is explained clearly in Adobe's FDK documentation, and supported by the FDK (which is a no-cost download from Adobe.com). I am not 100% certain, but I don't think it is supported by FontLab at this time, so it might be a good feature request for them. Don't know about FontMaster. <BR> <BR>I don't know that we've bothered covering this in any of our workshops, since it is really very simple compared to a lot of aspects of OpenType, it's something that only a minority of font developers are interested in, and the details are mostly specific to our FDK tool, which few people are using since FontLab is a much more integrated environment. <BR> <BR>As for support for the feature in InDesign, I am of course generally not allowed to comment on features for future versions of Adobe applications. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>
