  Spanish \u201CMauritanian\u201D.\r\nThis ornament is based on the greenery motive
  with strongly stylized stems and leaves fancifully interlacing.\r\nSuch ornaments
  were widely used in the 16th century in various  decorations from architecture to
  household goods, and book covers in particular.\r\nThe font contains high quality
  vector graphics with elaborate attention to details.\r\nThis collection consists
  of friezes (borders) and closed compositions in the shape of circles, squares, rectangles
  and triangles that can be organized into repeats (patterns).\r\nMorseke 2D can be
  easily used not only in a traditional approach, but also in grunge stylistics enriching
  your compositions. \r\n\r\non MyFonts: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/2d-typo/moreske-2d/]]"
