  remember that this option used to be on top of the fonts listing at a family\u2019s
  main page, not far from \u201CAvailable licensing options\u201D and \u201CGlyph
  coverage\u201D.\r\nAny hints?"

    to the right of the price.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking at a specific font, you can
    find your Albums by clicking on the triangle on the right of the Add to cart button."

  body: "AH!!\r\nthank you for releasing me from this enigma.\r\n\r\nCompletely idiotic.\r\n\r\nA
    classical case of a mislead communication process, I\u2019d say:\r\na) it has
    been changed without any necessity,\r\nb) it has been changed without giving notice,\r\nc)
    it has been changed without reaching any improvement,\r\nd) in its present form
    it is anything but self-explaining,\r\ne) the crucial bit is completely hidden
    and the functionality does not meet user expectations,\r\nf) the visual/structural
    link to the shopping-cart-function is irrational.\r\nhence the whole situation
    seems to be entirely idiotic.\r\n\r\nW H Y ?!!\r\n\r\nCan anyone explain?"

  body: "My hunch: This function might be used by few people, so they\u2019re first
    moving it to a hard-to-find spot in the interface. If anybody complains that the
    function is gone, they can say: Look, it\u2019s still there\u2014but of course,
    the result is that fewer people will be using it. If, after a while, the number
    of users has decreased even further, they might remove the function without a
    lot of fuss."

  body: Actually, I find this function fairly useful. Why do they hide it?
