  and pointed opinions about postage stamps, their purpose, and their design. Unfortunately,
  his theories didn't always hold up when put into practice, and he had a less than
  successful career as a designer of stamps. Accompanied by nine of Gill's previously
  unpublished preparatory drawings and sketches for stamps, <em>[[http://www.katranpress.com/books11.html|Notes
  on Postage Stamps]]</em> is a short, previously unpublished essay by Gill in which
  he succinctly lays out his philatelic ideas\u2014some of which were a little too
  idealistic and some of which were spot-on. All of them are interesting and thought-provoking.\r\n\r\n<em>Notes
  on Postage Stamps</em> contains fifty-six full-color illustrations, most of which
  will be completely unfamiliar to historians and enthusiasts of Gill's work. An afterword
  by Michael Russem chronicles Gill's seven attempts at stamp design\u2014only two
  of which resulted in published stamps.\r\n\r\nLearn all about it at www.katranpress.com/gill\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gill_4_4086.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gill_5_4134.jpg]"
