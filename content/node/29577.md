    selling: If licensed fonts count, I think Monotype wins for all the sales of Arial,
    Times New Roman, and Verdana that are packaged with Windows/MS Office.\r\n\r\nFor
    direct sales? Probably Monotype, at least now that Monotype has purchased Linotype
    and has a Brobdingnagian portfolio to sell. "

    *newcomer* among font sources, my pick is\r\nhttp://www.joshuadarden.com/\"\r\n\r\nThat's
    a bit ironic don't you think? Because I just saw a thread where you rubbished
    Adobe for not including various bits and bobs in their OTF fonts and this company
    doesn't even appear to sell OTF font formats at all! But I'll say it again, Conundrum
    Text is just luscious even though some of the ornaments are dodgy!"

    - harassing Hrant doesn't count\r\n2. Dud to quality ratio very low \r\n3. Emigre
    magazine - print always equals respect\r\n4. Mystique - ie. not on stage at every

  body: I don't know why Josh Darden has not gone into OpenType yet, but in his case
    it scarcely matters because oldstyle figures (among other bits and bobs) are loaded
    as default in all his families that I like. Adobe deserves to be rubbished for
    leaving OSFs out of so many OT serif families, especially when they were available
    in type 1.

  body: "While i am totally biased (being the founder of FontFonts), i hasten to mention
    that i've often heard that we treat our designers very well. They get a very decent
    percentage of the retail price, detailed reports about who sells their fonts,
    where there were sold and with what type of license and for which platform. And
    our fonts still get chosen by a board that has active typedesigners on it. So
    it is still very much a library by designers for designers. Having a board chosing
    new fonts (or commissioning them occasionally) does mean less taste control than
    a 2-person foundry like Emigre can excert, but results in greater variety of expression.
    Not all my taste, but judging by that alone would have prevented a lof of diverse
    talent from publishing FontFonts. \r\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t forget: a lot of good
    designers published their first fonts with us, like Tobias Frere-Jones, EvB and
    JvR, Nick Shinn, Ole Sch\xE4fer, Lucas de Groot, Rian Hughes and many others."
