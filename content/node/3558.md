  body: That Q looks like either of two metal typefaces shown in Mac McGrew&#39;s
    &#34;American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century&#34;. One is Linotype&#39;s
    Caslon Oldface &#40;p. 64&#41; and the other is the Intertype Caslon on p.66.
    <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t see any digital Caslons that matched it.

    of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/caslon-old-face/" target="_blank">
    Caslon Old Face</a> or Monotype&#39;s Caslon 128.

  body: '&#39;Types of Typefaces&#39; has a sample of Monotype&#39;s Caslon 128 and
    the back leaning a and the Q both match. I think that&#39;s it.  <BR> <BR>-The
    full f makes it unlikely to be Linotype or Intertype. '

  body: 'At least from the sample of Caslon 128 that is shown in Rookledge, I would
    disagree. The C has two serifs, unlike our poster&#39;s sample, and the g has
    different proportions of the two counters. '

  body: Oops, you&#39;re right Mike about the C, I didn&#39;t catch that. Seeing the
    spelling I am guessing that this was printed in England. Could it be another English
    Monotype Caslon?

  body: 'By the way, different sizes of Caslon from the same maker can have differences
    in the &#39;C&#39;. I have samples of Lino Caslon Old Face where the larger sizes
    have the two serifs, and the smaller one, one serif. The sample of Caslon 128
    in &#39;Types of Typefaces&#39; is at 24 pt and has both serifs, but with Caslon
    it doesn&#39;t mean it will at 12 pt.  '
