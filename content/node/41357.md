  of the key features of everyday life in switzerland is standardisation, ranging
  from the look of waste bags to the design of letterboxes. interestingly, and maybe
  perversely, 99% of all swiss letterboxes and door bells are inscribed in exactly
  the same way. there must be a whole army of name plate engravers all over the country,
  all using exactly the type style. i redraw the font together with gilles gavillet,
  generating 5 different weights (and an unpublished set of 5 alternate fonts)."
