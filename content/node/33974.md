body: "Today marks <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/\">Unzipped</a>\u2019s first anniversary.
  Exactly one year ago I posted my first three entries, after having done a test run
  with the premiere of my movie poster critiques the day before. Now, one year later,
  I am pleased to announce a new era in the existence of this blog \u2013 Unzipped
  will switch to (mostly) English.\r\n\r\nThe initial plan \u2013 as explained in
  my <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=15\">introductory post</a>
  \u2013 was to write in Dutch, with occasionally English and French translations.
  However it soon became obvious that I couldn\u2019t free up enough time to do these
  translations. It is for that exact same reason that I discontinued my English tutorials
  on <a href=\"http://www.fontfeed.com\">The FontFeed</a>.\r\n\r\nAt several moments
  the past year I have been discussing with Rudy whether or not to switch to English,
  but I was unsure as to how my Dutch-speaking audience would react to that. To me
  it felt a bit like \u201Cbetraying\u201D them, silly as it may sound. It was my
  trip to <a href=\"http://www.typoberlin.de/index.php/1/3\">Typo Berlin</a> last
  week that convinced me the switch would be beneficial. I encountered some French-speaking
  compatriots who lamented the fact that Unzipped didn't cater for half the population
  of Belgium, and even Dutch-speaking readers reassured me that a switch would not
  be taken badly. Plus the language issue possibly prevents further growth.\r\n\r\nSo
  tonight I am pleased to announce a new era in the existence of this blog. Unzipped
  will switch to (mostly) English. Announcements for local and Dutch language events
  will continue to be posted in Dutch, but the bulk of the entries will now be readable
  by everyone. I hope this won\u2019t slow me down too much, because Dutch is still
  my native language, but I guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see. Oh, and if
  and when you notice mistakes, please do tell me.\r\n\r\nI hope you\u2019ll enjoy
  the ride. I sure will."
