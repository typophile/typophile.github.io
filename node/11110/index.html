Upright, the most conservative set; <BR> <BR>2. Normal; <BR> <BR>3. Roundform; and <BR> <BR>4. Alternates, generally the most daring set. <BR> <BR> <BR>Many of the characters have an ability to form natural ligatures between them, especially in the Normal and Alternate sets. <BR> <BR>Not all of the characters have unique glyphs in each of the four sets, but many do. For example, there is one design for lower-case &quot;i&quot;, but there are 4 designs for Upper-Case &quot;E&quot; &ndash; 7, actually, if you count the 3 unique &quot;sigma&quot; glyphs, which function well as display upper-case &quot;E&quot;s. <BR> <BR>I'm still fine-tuning many aspects, such as kerning and hinting. <BR> <BR>The font was designed with display applications in mind, but the Normal and Upright versions, especially, seem to compare roughly to Kabel, Futura, and the like for short text applications. (No, I wouldn't set a book in it. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> ) <BR> <BR>I have tried to design enough original characters to justify yet another geometric face. As I pushed myself to find new geometric ways to portray the various glyphs, I arrived at some rather unexpected solutions &ndash; many of those ended up in the Alternates set, but a few of them were unique enough yet readable enough to be placed in the other sets. <BR> <BR>I'm still toying with the designs as well, of course, so nothing is set in stone as yet. <BR> <BR>Comments very much desired, and will be appreciated! <BR> <BR>David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, congrats on a wonderful system!  <BR>Where the kabel, avenir, avant garde,  <BR>futura systems are predictable  <BR>stay-at-home types, Seriatim is a loose <BR>geometric looking for some action. <BR> <BR>You've executed something on a high level, <BR>a level approaching Hoefler's Proteus or  <BR>House's Chalet systems. <BR> <BR>Your attention to detail is superb, <BR>as always. <BR> <BR>There's so much here to talk about  <BR>so I'll pinpoint some areas that  <BR>I like/dislike. <BR> <BR>DTD Seratim &ndash; My favorites are the uc K, Q <BR>and R, and the lc g.  <BR>The oblique M, V and W are reminiscent of avant <BR>garde alternates, but the perhaps the V and W <BR>could be less oblique. As you pair letters, <BR>there's going to be a pronounced gap with these. <BR>Maybe 6 degrees of separation might work. Your <BR>extended characters are great. <BR> <BR>DTD Seriatim Upright - This is the most  <BR>textworthy and the one that adheres to a <BR>geometric convention of past faces. <BR>I like the uc J wide like that.  <BR>The uc Q seems to call for an alternate.  <BR>The numbers 6 and 9&hellip;they seem a bit odd  <BR>for some reason. <BR> <BR>Seriatim Roundforms &ndash; This face is worth the price of admission by itself.  <BR>Every letter except for 'I' and 'V' uses rounded forms. What a treat. <BR>Your ampersand is darling.  <BR>Don't kill your darlings. <BR> <BR>Seriatim Alternates &ndash; I like a lot of the stuff  <BR>here, including the feel of the lower case.  <BR>I'd like to see some different treatments on  <BR>the some of the plain uppercase letters. D E F etc. <BR>I like the experimental uc K and R, but the <BR>uc P and the uc Z are not my favorites. <BR> <BR>Terrific work! <BR> <BR>bj</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Very cool, David. Nice coverage from bj. <BR>Here are a few more observations: <BR> <BR>¬ The Seriatim 'a' dark join distracts <BR>from the color of the rest of the glyphs. <BR> <BR>¬ The Seriatim 'g' is beautiful. I don't <BR>mind seeing more of Bruhn's Mercury 'g'  <BR>form spread about. <BR> <BR>¬ The Upright 's' looks feeble. Can't <BR>add some width? <BR> <BR>¬ I think the 6 and 9 look strange to bj  <BR>because we're accustomed to seeing <BR>angular Futurish numerals with this <BR>sort of face. I'm not sure if your <BR>departure is a good or bad thing yet. <BR>Need to see some set text. <BR> <BR>¬ As to be expected, your ankhs and <BR>daggers and other non-alphabetic <BR>symbols are delightful.

I love this paragraph. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> May I use the description later in promotion? <BR> <BR>&gt; DTD Seratim &ndash;  <BR>&gt; The oblique M, V and W are reminiscent of avant  <BR>&gt; garde alternates, but the perhaps the V and W  <BR>&gt; could be less oblique.

In other words, I want to keep the diagonals parallel to each other as much as possible. Granted this creates a kerning challenge, but if I am careful, I hope to catch all of the possible combinations. <BR> <BR>The sample above shows how many of the characters fit together, and some combinations for their own ligatures naturally (as the Seriatim &quot;LY&quot; combination does). <BR> <BR>&gt; DTD Seriatim Upright -  <BR>&gt; The uc Q seems to call for an alternate. <BR> <BR>&gt; Seriatim Alternates &ndash;  <BR>&gt; I'd like to see some different treatments on  <BR>&gt; the some of the plain uppercase letters. <BR>&gt; D E F etc. &hellip; the uc P and the uc Z are <BR>&gt; not my favorites.  <BR> <BR>I've been looking at many of those as well.

But I am prejudiced, admittedly. Does anyone else have an opinion on the name? <BR> <BR>Thanks for the comments &amp; encouragement! <BR> <BR>Stephen: <BR> <BR>Thanks to you too! <BR> <BR>&gt; ¬ The Seriatim 'a' dark join distracts  <BR>&gt; from the color of the rest of the glyphs. <BR> <BR>I agree, and I'm taking steps to minimize this without changing the structure too much, mostly by extending the counter's light trap up further into the join area, thinning the two strokes slightly as they come together. <BR> <BR>&gt; ¬ The Upright 's' looks feeble. Can't  <BR>&gt; add some width?  <BR> <BR>I could try, but I don't want to depart too much from the basic geometry. It's the same lc &quot;s&quot; as it used in the Seriatim (normal) set, and it essentially the same structure as Avant Garde Gothic, Kabel, and (to a lesser extent) Futura. I'll try adding a bit of a straight horizontal stroke between the curves to see if it works. <BR> <BR>As far as those &quot;6&quot; and &quot;9&quot; glyphs, As bj notes, the extenders are pretty strong, but I think Stephen may have a point. I tried for a different form (although the more angular Futura forms are available in the Seriatim Alternates set) so it looks unusual. I think they work pretty well with the other figures, especially the &quot;3&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;8&quot; and &quot;0&quot;. Anyone have other views on this? <BR> <BR>&gt; ¬ As to be expected, your ankhs and <BR>&gt; daggers and other non-alphabetic <BR>&gt; symbols are delightful.

		<div class="commentbody">David, you're sure giving us a lot of work, man!! :-)  Fortunately, BJ and Stephen have already done some great critiquing. <BR> <BR>&gt; I have tried to design enough original characters to justify yet another geometric face. <BR> <BR>And you've totally done it - not an easy feat in my book. Providing a set of fonts that can be intermixed isn't just technically cool, it really provides for a lot of versatility, and not just aesthetically either. <BR> <BR>Your tiled text setting is very revealing. I think you have a great balance between variance and congruence. And speaking of fancy words, at first I didn't like &quot;Seriatim&quot;, but now I think it's totally good, on a number of levels. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David - I think the base look is wonderful. <BR>The distractions come when you get a bit frilly. <BR>I'd try losing the Elvis bouffants at the top of  <BR>the 'p', 'k' and 'h'. Somehow they seem to go  <BR>against the general flow of the face. <BR> <BR>I'm impressed with your solutions on most of the  <BR>caps, but there are some inconsistencies in  <BR>width. The 'E' and 'R' are nice, but narrow when  <BR>compared to 'U', 'N', 'H', etc. Then the 'W' and  <BR>'V' are way wide - follow the lead of their  <BR>lowercase sisters, which look great. <BR> <BR>The 'y' needs another look. That wide sweep  <BR>creates some inevitable spacing issues. <BR> <BR>Beautiful: 'E', 'k' (sans bouffant) 'Q' (as usual) <BR> <BR>Great work! You're building a very usable family here. <BR> <BR>Stephen</div>

These will be adjusted. <BR> <BR>Funny you should mention ornaments. I'm indeed working on some, but I have a lot of work before a set will be completed. <BR> <BR>Thanks for all the encouragement. <BR> <BR>Hrant: <BR>I agree about the &quot;&amp;&quot;, and it's led me to double-check all of the curve-line vertices too. <BR> <BR>On looking at the uc &quot;G&quot;, I'm going to try eliminating the curve on the crossbar, but keeping the descending curve. I'll post it for comments soon. <BR> <BR>I'm conflicted about the lc aesc (&quot;ae&quot; ligature). I agree that the stem helps identify the glyphs, but it also made it really dark &ndash; and it doesn't seem to belong, especially in an italic. I'll tinker with it again and see if I can reach a better solution. I'm avoiding a sloped roman &quot;a&quot; form. <BR> <BR>David</div>

It was an intentional experiment at the time, but lately (and now especially with your comment), I think I agree that the top needs to be slightly smaller and the bottom slightly larger. Primer uses probably the strictest geometry of all of the Seriatim tribe, with optical adjustments kept to a minimum. Toward that end, are there any areas where I should incorporate more adjustments, specifically to Primer, but to any of the displayed glyphs in any of the sets? <BR> <BR>Any other comments?
