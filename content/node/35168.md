    method only works when the screen is in a horizontal state. As for his point about
    automatically disabling Cleartype in portrait mode, that should be a feature of
    the driver that handles the change, which is not being produced by Microsoft."

  body: "ClearType'd text looks different* in portrait, some may say worse, but utterly
    unreadable is nonsense. Maybe people are used to less than optimum type but Tablet
    PC's have been out for many years with very few complaints related to this issue.
    \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n*This is the main Reason Zune uses regular antialiasing,
    they wanted the same text experience regardless of orientation. "

    what happened to the review of the Cleartype patent that was on the MS web site!?
    I wanted to read what that guy who's an expert in video games thinks of it, (he

  body: "Enough already with the technology!\r\nWhat about the type designs?\r\nIn
    themselves, the typefaces are fine, but as a group they lack utility, being too
    much the same in proportion and contrast.\r\nDid the technology channel these
    designs into their similarity, or was it a corporate influence?\r\nWouldn't users
    have appreciated, for instance, a condensed style, an ultra light, and a slab
    serif as part of the CT toolbox?\r\nSurely Cleartype can render such things --
    why the omission?"

  body: "To be entirely fair, I think the sensitivity of ClearType to subpixel layout
    is a relatively minor problem, and I'd imagine that modern video connection standards
    such as EDID and their associated drivers will evolve fairly quickly to the point
    where they get the information across reliably (see <a href=\"http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2005-February/006233.html\">this
    thread</a> for a bit of discussion about getting that implemented on Linux).\r\n\r\nAbout
    the only use case where FontFocus is an obvious win is displaying PDF files (where
    the layout and metrics are inflexible) on monochrome displays like e-ink readers.
    Unfortunately, despite some early high hopes, it doesn't look like that market
    is going to amount to a hill of beans.\r\n\r\nThe more adventuresome among you
    may find <a href=\"http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/index.html\">Maxim
    Shemanarev's notes</a> on font rendering of interest. There are numerous methodological
    and other problems with his comparisons, but I'm glad that there are people out
    there who care about getting it right and are paying attention. I'll probably
    write an extended blog about all this, but am characteristically short on time
    right now.\r\n"

    thanks. While I'm delighted that this is getting more and more and more attention,
