  believe it\u2019s from the Gothic family by Nesbitt circa 1838. there\u2019s a sample
  letter on the RIT rob roy kelly site \u2014 http://www.rit.edu/~rkelly/html/05_obs/obs_plain1.html\r\n\r\nas
  well, there\u2019s gothic 13, which is on the myfonts site \u2014\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gothic-13/\r\nobviously,
  that is a condensed version, but possibly from the same family?\r\n\r\ncan anyone
  help me find this particular version? all i need are the cap letters.\r\na mac postscript
  or open type version would be preferable.\r\nthanks so much. any assistance would
  be appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LCohenSongsLoveHate.jpg]"

  body: The Solotype catalog lists a wood typeface it calls Chikamauga (likely a misspelling
    of Chickamauga - a US Civil War battlefield). It uses only the words MARKET FRESH
    for the showing, but the corresponding letters are perfect matches - most notably
    that R and S. I know of no digital version.

    body: "Many thanks to Miss Tiffany. I agree, Champion Heavyweight does appear
      to be the closest thing out there in the digital realm. I was familiar with
      some of the H&FJ faces, but not this one. I believe we can call the hunt off
      now, and much appreciation to everyone for the suggestions.\r\nPaul Nini\r\nDept
