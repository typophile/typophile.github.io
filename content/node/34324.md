body: "I've been reading about type size and leading, but now I am faced with an interesting
  puzzle.  Instructions require for a document with body text in a roman typeface,
  14 pt size, \"double spaced.\"  What would you consider double-spaced?  A couple
  of possibilities:  1) Line-spacing at exactly 28 pt because it's twice the hieght
  of the 14 pt text?  2) Line spacing at 32 pt based on the theory that that single-spaced
  14 pt type probably would be set 16 pt? \r\n\r\nNo, there is no opportunity to ask
  for further clarification.\r\n\r\nI know there's not a rigid right answer, but I
  am interested in how typophiles would approach this issue.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's an archaic term from the days of typewriters, where a single push of
    the return lever would result in advancing the paper a single line space, appropriate
    for the font it was equipped with (this would frequently, but not always, be equivalent
    to 10-12pt monospaced type on 12pt lines). A second push would result in double
    spacing, and a control lever could be set to automate this or give one and a half
    line spaces.\r\n\r\nMost word processing software has a simple toolbar function
    to simulate this. It gets a little more (needlessly) complicated the more sophisticated
    the software you use and the more knowledgeable you are."

  body: "Short answer:\r\n\r\n\r\nUse a word processing program, set the font to Times
    New Roman, 14pt, and click the double-spacing icon on the toolbar. Let the software
    do the overthinking for you. "

  body: "Is this a legal brief, by chance?  I ask because you might as well be quoting
    from the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure as to the requirements for briefs
    in the federal Courts of Appeals.  In any case, if you're using Microsoft Word,
    do NOT set \"line spacing\" to \"double.\"  Use \"Exactly 28.\"  In Word, \"double\"
    line spacing simply doubles the \"single\" line spacing, which builds in a small
    amount of leading.  Court rules require \"double spacing\" as a holdover from
    the typewriter days--in these days of word processors, etc., it's an ambiguous
    term.  But \"exactly 28\" puts the lines too far apart as it is for good readability
    and aesthetics--setting \"line spacing\" at \"double\" just makes things worse.\r\n\r\nIf
    this is indeed a legal brief, or some other situation involving text on 6.5 inch
    lines and 8.5 X ll inch paper, I also recommend that you choose a font other than
    Times New Roman.  It's too condensed, even at 14 point.  The best font on your
    computer, if it uses Windows XP or Vista, is probably Palatino Linotype.  Dunno
    about Macs.  Many local rules also let you use 13 point instead of 14.  You should
    consider that if it's an option."
