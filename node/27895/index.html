  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello children</p>
<p>I am designing the external signage of a jazz café/bar and I am facing a problem: the building is located in an extremely visually polluted area. There are all sort of signs, mainly huge monstruosities, bright and made out of plastic and neon lights (there are no restrictions whatsoever here).</p>
<p>I cannot (and I don&rsquo;t want) compete with those&hellip;I really would like to draw attention without being too invasive, possibly use organic or unusual materials and warm, welcoming lightning.</p>
<p>The building dates from 1914 (which is very old for Brazilian standards) and it still has beautiful art nouveau doors and windows. Not many of these buildings have survived in this area and I am trying really hard to keep what&rsquo;s left in terms of atmosphere and persuade the owners that it&rsquo;s possible to avoid the plastic and the neon.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s off topic but I thought you guys might have some example to show me or any idea. 
I&rsquo;ll post something I&rsquo;ve found, just so you know the kind of stuff I have in mind.</p>
<p>Needless to say I&rsquo;m very grateful for any input.</p>

<p>Have a traditional sign from the art nouveau period that&rsquo;s sympathetic to the building painted in one colour, even have some classic style lighting above it, but then don&rsquo;t have anything on it, apart from the name really really small with a delicate jazz/cafe symbol. Then people will be curious and have to get really close to read it. And then the waiters can grab them and drag them in&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;or for something at right angles to the facade howabout ribbons or strands of material or little flags made of a beautiful material that are continuously blown by a hidden fan, and they&rsquo;ve got musical notes on them, and they&rsquo;re constantly fluctuating in the wind like jazz music and&hellip;</p>

<p>Serious: thanks, I just told my client about the lightning ideas, projecting the logo is brilliant, she loved it. We&rsquo;ll have a go with the blue lcd lights too. And I loved the idea of creating some movement. A while ago I thought of putting a weathervane (is that how you call it?) or some sort of kinetic sculpture but I like the ribbons idea, it&rsquo;s more gentle.</p>

<p>unfortunately this is one of these cities you drive everywhere not because you need to but because if you walk, people might think you&rsquo;re (horror!) poor&hellip;
that&rsquo;s why everything is disproportionate, signs are huuuuuuuge, you don&rsquo;t even see them if you are walking! Trust me: it&rsquo;s sad.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>Blue LCD lights? I&rsquo;m a bit confused by that sort of terminology.</p>
<p>Neon, high output fluorescent HO/D lamps and LEDs are the three most commonly used methods in lighting signs.</p>
<p>The first thing the client and designer must both consider: the budget. What is the customer willing to spend? That will determine quite a bit on what sort of methods may be used. Very often customers will want to seriously under-spend on their exterior sign program when they really need to be making that the central focus of their marketing campaign.</p>
<p>The next thing to consider is what kinds of signs are actually practical to build.</p>
<p>If you want to have a lighted sign that also maintains harmony with a building&rsquo;s architecture then channel letters are usually the best choice. They can be scaled to large, very legible sizes while fitting into the visual framework of the building fascia.</p>
<p>One downside of channel letters: you&rsquo;re limited on your choices of type. You need at least a 2&quot; wide stroke to accomodate neon and glass housings. Channel letters set in some thin, serifed typeface like Diotima might work&hellip;if they&rsquo;re built 7 feet tall.</p>
<p>The other downside of channel letters: you could be drilling lots of holes for electrical primaries through the building fascia. You&rsquo;ll really do that with letters flush-mounted to the building surface. Letters that are mounted to a cabinet or thin metal raceway are less destructive. You&rsquo;ll have only one or two holes drilled for electrical supply.</p>
<p>As far as style goes, most signs are butt ugly because 1: they are a moronic clutter of useless unmemorable information and 2: most sign designers have no talent to compose type and graphics properly at all. For the most part much of the sign industry is a forsaken wasteland. Few people with talent want to make signs for a living. So its no surprise so many of America&rsquo;s commercial streets look like utter garbage. As long as we&rsquo;re not willing to give that form of advertising any respect at all the ugliness will continue.</p>
<p>Aside from that, any store owner should work hard to make his own business look good even if all the other stores around the property look like garbage.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you are talkin' Art Nouveau, I&rsquo;m thinking Guimard or Gaudi. Guimard&rsquo;s signs for le Métro in Paris are still beautiful. Very organic forms, and no blue laser lights.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/nouveau_5022.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The sculptural shapes suggest movement. The font makes one smile. I think such a thing would be a nice counterpoint to the jungle of man-made neon signs described by you, and seen by all of us (in local settings). Of course, this sort of sign would need to rely heavily on (and compliment) the architecture of the building.</p>
<p>Cheers, Ken</p>
<p>You could also look at the posters of Beardsley and Mucha. And the work of Charles Mackintosh.</p>
<p>Just a thought. Trying to give you something different to think about. But if the client has already bought into an approach, my humble advice would be to go with that!!</p>
<p>I like the first batch of signs you posted. That sort of silhouette-y cut-metal signage would also offer a good counterpoint to a bunch of surrounding flashy illuminated signs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you so much everyone. Here 2 bad pics of the façade. The arrow points to the old sign to be replaced. The traffic goes on only one direction so drivers can&rsquo;t actually see the big white wall (which doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t project something on it). As you can see, the neighbouring estate agency&rsquo;s sign (Lafic) is so big that it hides a big part of the café building, which is really annoying.</p>

<p>The name of the place is Almanach Café. The visual identity is kind of defined already. The logo is more 70s than art-nouveau, it&rsquo;s my fault: I was unable to assert myself. I presented nice logos with references to Mackintosh, to iron-work, to stained glass etc. even references to toulouse-lautrec but I guess it&rsquo;s a cultural issue. Maybe people can&rsquo;t relate to these references. We ended up with a  retro-psychedelic visual identity. Mea culpa.</p>
<p>Colours: dark red and orange/ocra.</p>
<p>Also when I say visually polluted I don&rsquo;t mean the excitement of a Piccadily Circus or Times Square&hellip;it&rsquo;s the squalid, ill-planned type, not a pretty sight.
Thanks again everyone. Keep posting!</p>

<p><cite>Jazzy font? Wazzat look like? </cite>
ahhh, good question&hellip;I was thinking 20s/30s you see. My client put her eyes on that
<img src="/images/old-images/NewHampshireBold_sample_5980.jpg" alt="">
and who said you could change her mind? 
However the issue now is not the logo or the font: it&rsquo;s the material and format of the external signage&hellip;in fact it&rsquo;s all together.</p>
<p>And Bobby, I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for your detailed instructions.</p>

<p>Of course, this refers to the design of the font itself, as opposed to any historical connotations. So it&rsquo;s probably not useful to you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Everything is useful, believe me. Thanks for that. It&rsquo;s lovely. In our first meetings the client told me she didn&rsquo;t want anything too feminine and almost every script was too feminine to her. I guess it would have been the same with Plumero. We also needed contrast. A lot of contrast, not only due to the visually polluted environment but also because the publications where she usually advertises the cafe&rsquo;s events are also very cluttered so we needed something bold that would work well in black and white&hellip;but with a little playful twist. So that was how we came to the New Hampshire thing. 
So the problem of standing out was there from the beginning, not only for the external sign.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Andi. Knowing what most streets look like in the vast majority of Brazilian cities (drab and polluted and disharmonious), a good new paint job (nice warm colours, maybe brick red with a beige trim) and really good lighting might be the best start. I bet that would make the building stand out immediately: it would look clean and well-kept and luminous, in stark contrast to all the others around it.</p>
<p>How about the little garden at the entrance? Maybe a canopy of some sort from the front gate to the front door (which I assume is on top of the stairs), with lighting that makes it glow from the inside, would add a nice touch.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I didn&rsquo;t answer before because I was at a design conference in Sao Paulo but thanks for the comments. Paul, I&rsquo;m not sure I like that facade&hellip;sorry! I&rsquo;m trying really hard not to hide the building, I think what Andi, Eben and Erik say is more relevant for this kind of building and yes! It needs to be painted urgently&hellip;after that I think even a nice little wooden sign would stand out. And plants, lots of them. It&rsquo;s a huge problem around here, not enough trees on the streets.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of the craziness around here, check this out:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/casa-rosada-small_3945.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The shop appropriated the palm trees to draw attention to their window&hellip;I asked around but nobody seem to find it horrendous and, most importantly: nobody seems to care that the palmtrees do NOT belong to the shop but to the community&hellip;the important thing is that it screams as loud as it can that &ldquo;this is a vibrant, commercial area&rdquo; it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s ugly.</p>
