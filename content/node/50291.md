  body: When I type out the name of the same street, for example, in Photoshop and
    place it next to the original, they do not look alike. The one in the Google Maps
    seems to be longer (lengthwise) and they just don't match up. Is there a specific
    setting to the Arial?

  body: Hmm, I don't know what else it could be. It's certainly not Helvetica.
