  out at TypeCon this year. Specifically, I'd like to get the little \"I love type\"
  buttons. Does anyone know who made those? Or more importantly, where I can get more
  of them from? Any leads would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nAndrea"

    table. Perhaps a board member would know?

    believe that they were distributed specifically for TypeCon, so I'm not sure they'll
    be available otherwise. Bother him a little, offer him some money perhaps :)\r\n\r\nIn
    addition, Typophile had a nice selection of buttons floating around and you may
    have seen the black and white \"I love helvetica\" and \"I hate helvetica,\" provided
    by Gary Huswit of the <a href=\"http://www.helveticafilm.com/\">Helvetica</a>
    documentary."
