  is incoming auditor of the DJ society of the local university. The brief is very
  loose, with simplicity important. I would be interested to hear thoughts on this
  concept\u2026 The execution is very rough at the moment.\r\n\r\nUses will mainly
  include flyers, T-shirts and posters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dj_soc1_4362.png]\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\nRoss"

    it's your design after all. :)"

    well.\r\nMost notably between the D and the jack.\r\n\r\nWil"

  body: "It seems to me that there is not enough space between the turntable arm and
    the text at the bottom - they are kind of running into each other. Also, seems
    like the circle (record) is a little too small.\r\n\r\nI like the overall graphic
    nature of the mark.\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

    now, in all seriousness,\r\nit feels very phallic to me. \r\n\r\nJust a thought. "

    way - the phallic plug and the mammary record in the background.\r\n\r\nIf it
    was not designed this way, then yes, you've got a big problem :-)\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Hi, there is a different hint!\r\n\r\nThe jack entering from bottom left
    has some weight - in relation to the symmetry!\r\nThe \"DJ\" (LARGE LETTERS) have
    weight too - in realation of all letters.\r\n\r\nIF you let the jack entering
    from right top... and reachig to the same position like now... then it has TWO
    positive effects:\r\na) the jack could be interpreted as the arm of a turntable
    (in it's correct positon) - and\r\nb) there will be no tight squeeze between jack
    and text...\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/soc_test_5293.jpg]"
