		<div class="commentbody">The background image and the logo look great. <BR> <BR>First off. I don't care what version you're on, so why tell me? If you've got a couple of versions then fair enough, but unless you want to link to previous versions for users who might be familiar with an old site then I'd drop that. <BR> <BR>I'm not 100% keen on the links. Unless you're going to change the colour of the links then you'll have to keep it for links in the text, but I'd try and drop it from the menu items for evry state but the roll over. <BR> <BR>I thought there was a little bit confusion over the colour. The sections of type picked out with colour look good in terms of style, but I felt that using the same colour as the links gave them status in excess of their place in the content (eg. the media coverage page). <BR> <BR>The breadcrumbs are helpful, but again, with the current page looking like a link I wasn't as sure of where I was as I could have been. Also if you made them smaller, you'd have room to keep the links for each item in the portfolio, without having to use 'next' and 'previous'. <BR> <BR>I guess I feel that there's not quite enough hierarchy across the site. On the portfolio&gt;logos page the note has 'Note:' in bold, which is way too strong for a footnote given the weight of the rest of the page (apart from anything else, I think most people would get it was a footnote from the asterisk). <BR> <BR>Generally it looks great, I don't think you've made any mistakes and even though users won't care it's your first attempt that makes it more impressive. <BR> <BR>cheers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">first off great job. I like the logo. its sweat <BR> <BR>heres my concerns: <BR> <BR>the logo looks like it is competing with everything in the site. maybe scale it down.  I would also consider a san serif font for the links I am not sure but it also looks like they are fighting with the logo as well. <BR> <BR>Also the actual site seems a bit crowded on a screen resolution of 1024x768.  <BR> <BR>keep us posted</div>
