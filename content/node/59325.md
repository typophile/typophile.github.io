  decided to call my freelance \u201Cagency\u201D Red Door Design. If only had I Googled
  it first, I would have found out just how many other people had the same idea. Shoot,
  I even had a logo. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/reddoor_6611.jpg]\r\n\r\nEdit:
  Is there a way to use curly quotes in the subject?"

  body: "The top and bottom lines lack contrast. They are both uppercase, use the
    same typeface and color and are too similar in size.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've been there
    several times when a good idea turns out to be taken, but I've always googled
    first. It's the silly things, like when famous foreigners have first or second
    names that sound like something I've thought up in a different language, that
    annoy me the most."

    \r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback. Though I think what you are describing as
    design flaws are actually strengths, no?"

  body: I think they're flaws, since it's neither here nor there, and thus looks sloppy.

  body: It's clear that you've tried to add contrast, since one of the lines is smaller,
    but the contrast is not really there, so it looks sloppy. I'm somehow confident
    about this one.

  body: "I'm interested to hear if other people agree with you on this one. Maybe
    my eye is off, but I happen to think that having too much contrast within the
    type itself will detract from the simplicity and stability, and make it look unprofessional,
    not the other way around. I guess the point is moot though, since I won't be using
    it anyway.\r\n\r\nI tried a few different text treatments to the bottom line to
    create some more contrast and interest, but nothing really worked out. I didn't
    want to spend too much time on it. Maybe I need to abandon the Charlemagne font
    for something with more weights/styles."

    fix would be just bumping the size down, I suppose."

  body: 'I like the graphic a lot, but I''m going to have to side with Reinis on the
    type issue. I agree that too much contrast is distracting, but there''s that middle
    ground between too much and not enough that I feel hasn''t quite been reached.
    So sorry you won''t be able to use this; I don''t advocate violence, but you should
    find the other people and threaten physical harm if they don''t relinquish control
    of the name ;) '

    truly original. What are your new thoughts?

  body: "I would say that reinis was very articulate in describing the problem in
    the Logomark. The symbol though is just beautiful. I know it's tricky here to
    create contrast between \"Red Door\" and \"Design\" cause it's really one big
    title \"Red Door Design\", but what bothers me the most now is that there is different
    stroke widths in the two sizes, one way to fix that is to use all caps on one
    line and \"real\" small caps on the second but then what the \"sloppiness\" reinis
    is mentioning will still be there.\r\nBest solution is to ditch the word \"Design\"
    altogether or to give it far less importance in the mark."
