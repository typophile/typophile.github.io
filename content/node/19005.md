body: "This is the first article in my school's architecture magazine. I've posted
  here before regarding the cover, but this time I need some help with the layout
  - essentially I'd like it to be more interesting than it was before, and I'm having
  some issues regarding the font choice for the body. \r\n\r\nThe budget is tight,
  so I'm deciding to stick to fonts I already have (Myriad, Trebuchet, Bell, etc).
  I used Trebuchet as the body font in the first issue and I didn't quite like the
  result, so I'm moving to a serif font. I still like Trebuchet for the headlines,
  so I'm pretty much sticking to that unless someone can offer a better replacement.
  \r\n\r\nPlease look at this spread and let me know what you think. Any comment would
  be much appreciated. \r\n\r\nthanks, \r\nmacgirl\r\n\r\nP.S. I am not a graphic
  designer. Just an architecture student who is addicted to fonts. "

  body: "A couple of initial thoughts for you. Your grid is going to be quite flexible
    for you and work to your advantage in allowing for creative and interesting compositions,
    however I do think this could be adjusted slightly. \r\n\r\nI think you could
    allow for slightly more room in the outside margins \u2013 don\u2019t forget we
    have thumbs and a generous space for mine is always appreciated. \r\n\r\nDoes
    the grid allow for or require space for page markers and general navigation indicators?
    For example have you developed a system for section marking, page numbering etc?
    If this is to be a requirement, now or in the future, perhaps either the top or
    bottom margin will benefit form extra space also.\r\n\r\nLooking at this grid
    it actually allows for 4 col not just 2? You do not always have to confine yourself
    to only two col. Experiment with combinations of wide and thin column where appropriate.\r\n\r\nDoes
    your grid indicate a specified height at which article headings, sub heads, and
    intro paragraphs fall? Dictating this may allow for more consistency from article
    to article, issue to issue.\r\n\r\nHave you considered a method for pull quotes,
    and their usage? For example size, typeface choice, emphasis etc.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is your chosen serif for body copy at this stage?\r\n\r\nHope these ideas help.
    Good luck.\r\n\r\nBest.\r\n-nic\r\n"

  body: "I see your point about the margins... however, the margins are already set
    at 1/2\" and I lose 1/4 of that during trimming (the printer told me that). I
    don;t know if I can afford to lose more paper space, as the mag is tiny as it
    is. \r\n\r\nAs for general navigation, I will place the page numbers at the bottom
    center of the page. I tried top right and it didn't work too well. ONce I place
    those in, I'll upload again. \r\n\r\nAs for section markers, I'm still debating
    that. I was thinking of something running down the right side of the page, in
    three shades of green (one for each section of the mag) and in three locations
    (top, center, bottom) which would correspond to that section. It should be easy
    to navigate, I think, once I include these section markers. \r\n\r\nI will look
    into wide/thin columns, as well as a 4-column layout for the second section of
    the mag, which is the student work. I'll post that once ready. \r\n\r\nFinally,
    for articles the headline always falls either directly above or directly on the
    middle third of the grid, but always around that center area. That allows me to
    have some wiggle room for headlines that are too long (I can break them to two
    lines, like the example) or headlines that are too short (which can have a larger
    font size). \r\n\r\nThe pull quotes are being dealt with in the same manner as
    the headlines: Trebuchet at a small point size. \r\n\r\nMy big, big question is
    about the serif. Do Trebuchet and Bell (my chosen serif for now) play well together?
    Sometimes I think they do, sometimes I think they don't. Maybe I need an extra
    set of eyes to choose this. \r\n\r\nIf Bell is not a good option, then which other
    serif can I use? \r\n\r\nthanks a bunch, \r\n\r\nmacgirl"

    you considered Gill Sans at all? Gill is an option I pose as it is slightly \"thinner\"

    the page numbers are way too close to the copy columns.\r\n\r\n2) I think the
    gutters in between columns are too narrow...Might be difficult to distinguish
    a line break. I've noticed a number of justified word spacing on the text column
    that are approximately the same width as your gutter.\r\n\r\n3) Also in the article
    title page and the picture page, your paragraphs are divided by a space with the
    start of the next paragraph set justified left. In the text page pdfs, there is
    a space and paragraph indention. I think paragraph treatments should be consistent?
    \r\n\r\nHope this helps. Thanks\r\n\r\nJoseph"

  body: "I prefer the Minion choice, but a few points:\r\nYour indent seems excessive
    especially when you have a line space I think you could bring it back to an em
    (the height of your leading).\r\nI would try to make the body copy sit on a baseline
    grid, so that when you break it with a picture or pull quote the two columns still
    align because you have a narrow gutter it is more noticeable. \r\nThe pull quotes
    should probably be ranged left and ragged right with as few hyphens (if any) as
    you can get away with and should either really intrude into a column or not at
    all (your Minion pdf is really too small an intrusion) the space at top at bottom
    should ideally appear the same, try to keep at least three lines together when
    breaking a paragraph with either a column break or pull quote \u2013 you need
    to be flexible with your grid.\r\nDepending on the number of pages you could steal
    some space from the centre of your grid to add to the outside margins. \r\nWhere
    you mention creep (the loss of up to a quarter of your margin during trimming)
    you should also note this will affect any sidebar section markers, although you
    could apply them to the top or bottom of the page.\r\nHope some of this helps.\r\nTim"

  body: "Hi, Susana,\r\n\r\nI agree with some of the comments already posted here.
    I think that you are off to a good start by having used a grid to organize the
    page layout, but maybe it could use some adjusting.\r\n\r\nAs <strong>juki</strong>
    says, at 1/8 of an inch your gutter is too narrow to keep the columns separated
    visually. The gutter should be at least 1 pica wide (12 points, or 0.166 inches),
    just to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nIf you modify the gutter width, you may also
    want to consider modifying the amount of columns within the page grid. May I suggest
    having an uneven number of columns rather than an even number? This might give
    you more flexibility to play around with different column widths (for example,
    you could have two wide columns for the main text and a thinner column reserved
    for photo captions, but otherwise kept blank -- this would give your pages some
    much-needed white space, as well).\r\n\r\nLast but not least, using a grid does
    not mean that you have to fill up every last space with text... Things might start
    to look \"boxy.\" Try using a left-only justification (i.e., ragged right), as
    <strong>timd</strong> suggests, even for the main body copy, and compare that
    with the current justified spread.\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful!\r\n"

    the pull quotes are not supposed to be indented. I mistakenly  applied the same
    paragraph style to the pull quotes as I did for the rest of the text, so I will
    correct that soon. One thing I was thinking for the pull quotes (which I will
    post in the next PDF'd version) is to justify them to whatever side they happen
    to touch the body text (e.g., if the pull quote is on a left page, then it would
    be justified to the right because the pull quote's right side will \"touch\" the
    body text and its left side will \"float\" towards the margin). Makes any sense?
    I will fix and show when I'm done.  \r\n\r\ntimd:\r\n\r\nI agree with the Nathan's

    picked up on the \"populism\" thing. Will fix as well. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how
    to go about not hyphenating certain words (like Koolhaas, for instance) when the
    rest of the text is being hyphenated. Is there a way to do this?\r\n\r\nI will
    post soon. :)\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nmacgirl"

    I'd hyphenate manually on all the pull quotes in future. They (the pull quotes)

    and the whole thing will look so much nicer.
