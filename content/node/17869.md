body: "Dear forum members,\r\n\r\nI'm working on my first italic font face*, so there
  is a lot to explore for me in there yet. Are there any tips, guides, books, etc.
  that talk about italics specifically?\r\nAlso, are there special things to consider
  for swash characters? Are there only uppercase ones usually, or also lc?\r\nEvery
  annotation is useful for me...\r\n\r\nSpecific question at the moment: What characters
  stay upright even in an italic version of a font? I've read about it somewhere (can't
  remember where and when), and I've already seen typefaces, that have no italic mathematical
  operators. Are there more characters that stay in their roman form?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help\r\nsebilar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* an italic version of <a href=http://typophile.com/node/17136>this
  one</a>.\r\n"

    characters for as many lettters (uppercase or lowercase) as the designer wants
    to creat variants for."
