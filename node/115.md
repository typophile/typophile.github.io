  body: I always be careful to don&#39;t say much, but i think I say too much when
    I have say that everybody know it :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Your are more than close Heinrich,
    its not the new OPTIMA, but Optima ... <BR> <BR>Please give the proper name &#40;and
    if possible the weight too.&#41; And I will declare you the winner. <BR> <BR>What
    is funny with this, is there is an announce of a lecture in US of Zapf speaking
    about his new family on typophile during this quiz!!! <BR> <BR>Last but not least,
    I don&#39;t have the all family at all. Just a vfb file &#40;Fontlab file&#41;
    of the weight that I used here that I have received in last June 02, during the
    production of Sabon Next from Linotype as model for some extended character set.
