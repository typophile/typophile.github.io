  body: "\"Char Set\" is \"Character Set\". For Windows Type 1 font, this setting
    informs the operating system which codepage the font supports (Windows 1252 ANSI/Western,
    Windows 1250 Central European etc.) This information is used to map glyphs into
    Unicode codepoints, although some applications use the PostScript glyph names
    included in the font rather than relying on the MS Char Set information. \r\n\r\nA."
