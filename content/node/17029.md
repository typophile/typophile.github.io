    market it to the best of my ability ;-)\r\n\r\nActually, with FontExplorer X,
    we [Linotype] have a bunch more distribution options available than before. But
    this isn't really a New Year's resolution thing. You can contact me offline about
    this anytime you like."

    asked if she could make one for me. I agreed on the basis that it would be specific,
    achievable, and with an obvious measure of success. So she told me that my resolution
    was to teach myself to make really good omelettes. A model resolution, really,
    and two weeks into January I had achieved my goal. I wonder what she has in mind
    for 2006...?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, <a href=\"http://www.zefrank.com/ny05/\">Ze

    resisting the whole life-altering mandate and simply using the cultural impulse
    to make a small decision. They're not supposed to be so hard to implement, right?
    Kind of like it's not supposed to be so bloody hard to package up a couple of
    copies of recently published books to ship off to the National Library for legal
    deposit? But, my god, it IS impossible. No, wait, maybe that could be a resolution.
    Package up 2 copies of 2 titles and put them in the mail to the National Library.
    I mean, if I can do that, then maybe I could update my website the next day. And
    the next day I could file away all this crap stacked on the floor next to my desk.
    And the next day I could come up with the perfect design for that book scheduled
    for the printer next week.\r\n\r\nNo, wait. That's the problem, right? One thing
    and then another and then another and then another... No, no. Just one thing.
    Decide. Take action. Done. One thing. A resolution.\r\n\r\nThat said, my resolution
    tonight was to start a letter to my friend Lee, and I've used up my late-night
    energy responding to this bloody thread. And now I'm hungry. And I should get
    to bed before 1am for a change.\r\n\r\nAh, hell, screw it. Another year of chasing
    the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\nps. I resolve not to make resolutions about work. Small
    (aka: meaningful) resolutions (eg: \"learn to make really good omelettes\") will
    result in the work-stuff taking care of itself."
