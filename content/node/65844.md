  (yeah, I'm shipping him a good bottle of Scotch to make up for it) and we're listening
  to the Rose Bowl on a local radio station. The announcers are complaining about
  how hard it is to identify the Oregon State players, and one of them says that not
  only are the white letters with a yellow outline hard to read, but the font is ugly
  too.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nikeblog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Oregon-Ducks-Football-Jersey-LeGarrette-Blount.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://dienu.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/oregon.jpg\r\n\r\n"

    is running around. What should be scheduled is interviews to replace the designer

  body: Just in case any revenooers are hanging out here, "shipping" was a colloquialism.
    I'm not personally shipping any liquor -- that would be (ahem) illegal. Nope,
    I'm going to find an Internet retailer.

    the ones who need to see the optometrist?

  body: Belotti Bold is atrocious from a typographic perspective, but from a branding
    perspective it is very fitting. The ugly rounded bloated hippie font is consistently
    used on Oregon's every changing repertoire of [[http://michaelprincip.com/oregon_uniset.html|uniform/helmet
    combinations]]. It fits with the innovative aspect of the Oregon offense. And
    don't forget, Eugene is one giant hippie commune!
