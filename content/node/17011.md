    few days, I will post a portion of a glyph and will send the name of the typeface
    etc to Yves (if that's no problem) so he can answer the questions about the glyph.
    Alright?

    had never noticed how nice this face is. Regarding the name, from MyFonts:\r\n\r\n<em>ITC
    Braganza is the work of British designer Phill Grimshaw, an elegant typeface steeped
    in historical inspiration. Reminiscent of the handwritten manuscript styles of
    the 16th century, the name Braganza refers to Catherine, Duchess of Braganza,
    who was a prominent figure in Portugal at the time. The vertical script style
    displays the elegance and refinement which distinguished the Royal Courts of the
    16th century.</em>\r\n\r\nI'd like to add that Catarina de Bragan\xE7a was responsible
    for one thing the Brits are known for: <strong>teatime</strong> http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2998461"
