    to blend them into one harmonious thing? It's probably better to just make it
    from scratch!!\r\n\r\nBTW, just FYI at least some of those fonts have a \"no-modification\"
    clause in their EULA. I'm personally not against people ignoring such a clause,
    but do make dead sure that any derivative font doesn't \"drift\" to other people's
    computers...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
