  body: "Since these are manufactured letters it's possible that changes would be
    made for various reasons related to manufacturability, planned layout, or sturdiness,
    even if a standard typeface was used as a model. I cannot find a serif font with
    a J and R combination like this lettering. The R in particular seems oddly shaped,
    probably so that the leg/bowl junction would be stronger, but this is a guess.\r\n\r\nI
    would say this is custom lettering, and not really a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    The R threw me off.  Thanks for the response
