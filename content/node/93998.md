  editing):\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://mediumlarge.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/feral-ferrel.jpg\">\r\n\r\nAnd
  I think it's rather neat how time has turned what started as some kind of garalde
  into something... quite appealing. At least in parts, mainly the condensed bit.
  Sort of Vojt\u011Bch Preissig-esque.\r\n\r\nSome sort of \"aestethic of failure\"
  seems possible here, aikin to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_(music)|glitch
  music]] - I know we've had some threads on digital artefacts and the like here recently,
  and of course there are grunge and \"letterpress-simulating\" typefaces out there,
  but I'm wondering what other directions \"deliberately failing\" typefaces could
  take."

    \u201Cfauve grot\u201D (while I prefer \u201CPrerennerism\u201D myself) in which
    geometric typefaces are deliberately clumsy in design.\r\nBut maybe it wasn\u2019t
    what you had in mind."
