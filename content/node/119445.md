body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI've designed a book in two colors - red and black, mostly
  text, but some decorative graphics in red. This is my first book in two colors.
  I worked using CMYK specs, and set the red to 0,100,100,0. However, my printer needs
  the colors to be selected from the Solid Uncoated Pantone Library. I have had difficulty
  find the right red to use.\r\n\r\nMy printer has recommended Pantone 185, but I
  find this is not intense enough: a bit dull, or faint. Moving up just slightly,
  to 186 and higher, the colors become too brown.\r\n\r\nI have seen books published
  in red and black ink (liturgical books, predominantly), where the red is bright,
  clear, and intense. Can someone recommend a good pantone number? Thank you.\r\n\r\nHerman"

  body: "Thanks; this is a useful tool. It leads to another question: looks like 485
    or 1797 would fit the bill. When I make a swatch in indesign with those values,
    the resulting color is quite different: fainter, paler. Why?\r\n\r\n"

    Solid Uncoated Pantone Library\r\n> ...not intense enough\r\n\r\nIf you're looking
    an uncoated swatches, I presume you're using uncoated paper. Uncoated paper will
    soak up the ink and make the colors less vivid. A coated stock \u2014\_like most
    magazines are printed on \u2014\_will produce more vivid results (although a coated
    stock isn't appropriate for every job).\r\n\r\nThe same ink color can look different
    on coated or uncoated stock, so use the appropriate coated or uncoated section
    of the Pantone swatch book.\r\n\r\n> When I make a swatch in indesign with those
    values, \r\n> the resulting color is quite different\r\n\r\nDon't go by what it
    looks like on a computer monitor. Use the printed color swatches. \r\n\r\nThis
    might be overkill, but if you're really concerned about getting the exact color
    you want, ask the printer for an ink drawdown. They will take some of the actual
    ink you've picked and spread it on the paper stock you've chosen. There might
    be an extra charge for this, but it is the best way to see how it'll actually
    look before printing. A quick printer might say \"huh?\", but a full-service professional
    print shop should be glad to do it."

  body: "If you are wanting a 2-color traditional offset printing job then using a
    CMYK mix for your Red won't work because then, using the numbers you chose, it
    becomes a 3-color job ( [100m+100y+k) so your printer is actually saving you some
    money (and headaches for him).\r\n\r\nThe latest Pantone books have quite a number
    of new colors in them in the higher number ranges so be sure your printer has
    a recent Pantone book, preferably not more than four years old.\r\n\r\nThe color
    of the paper stock you are using will also affect the end result so you have to
    take that into account.\r\n\r\nIf you went strictly digital instead of offset,
    you might have better luck getting the exact red using CMYK, but at the expense
    of quality. \r\n\r\nYou will never be able to match the full spectrum of RGB using
    CMYK so don't expect to; reasonably close is all you can get. In 2-color traditional
    offset, Pantone is the only way to go. Also, but at extra expense, you can ask
    your printer to do a custom ink mix.\r\n"

  body: "A way to intensify a color (colour) is to print twice, eg put each sheet
    thru the press twice. Or use a clear varnish for the second run.\r\n\r\nSomething
    else: the Pantone Matching System has its limitations, there are others that may
    have \u2018better\u2019 reds, like the Japanese Toyo or the German HKS. InDesign
    has colour libraries for these. Your printer may have to special order a can of
    ink in case you want something outside the PMS."

  body: George's comments reminded me of something. It's possible the printer plans
    to use a digital press but was showing you pantone chips to choose color that
    he'll produce via CMYK. Digital presses have improved but you'll have better quality
    with a press that is laying down actual red ink rather than using CMYK.
