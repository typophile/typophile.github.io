  body: "Monospace.\r\nSomething new, I note the reference to 2012. \r\nIf this is
    a screen play the usual rule is that it must be written in courier 12 point, a
    monospaced font where the consistant character spacing means one page approximately
    equals one minute of screen time. Recently screen plays are also accepted in Courier
    Prime and Courier Final Draft. But none match your sample.\r\nI did not find a
    full match from any type writer fonts -- also monospaced -- via Identifont & Myfonts,
    although some were close. Probably your font(s) could be found by going though
    the foundries that are not included there. Not at H&FJ. Some key points for comparison
    are the ear and lower bowl on g, 3, 2, j, a, &  italic x.\r\nIdentification goes
    to someone who perseveres in the search.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Finally found a match for the italic!\r\nIt's <a href=\"http://www.milieugrotesque.com/typeface-lacrima\">
    Lacrima Italic</a>.\r\nThe regular is almost generic and any of several typewriter
    faces could be substituted without too much notice.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "The scale of the specimen image is small so the italic could fit either Lacrima
    Italic or Pitch.\r\nSince the Pitch regular also fits, I defer to Jens and now
    say that the italic is probably also Pitch.\r\nDon"
