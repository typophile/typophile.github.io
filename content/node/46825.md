  the the first time building a mm font, i'm still having some trouble understanding
  how do i check compatibility between the two masters i built, using the assign master
  operation...   Can i expect that the outine nodes are linked in both masters after
  assigning the new master?  Should i use the match masters action to check if their
  outlines are compatible?\r\n\r\nI also checked the \"convert hints to links\" when
  defining the weight axis. Should i use manual interpolation when two outlines are
  incompatible?\r\n\r\nMaybe it depends on the situation, but what would be the best
  (or most used) method to create the master font: using the blend feature, the mask
  to master action, or with the assign new master command?\r\n\r\nSorry for posting
  so many questions\r\nThanks in advance\r\n \r\nRegards"

    deals with some of your questions, but you may also google for "multiple master
    site:typophile.com". I am sure all of them have been discussed.
