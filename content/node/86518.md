  together\r\nmy arsenal of regular fonts to do battle with, and I could do with a
  couple of \r\ndecent monospace fonts being added.\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend some
  for me to look at. Preferably that work well\r\nfor contact details on stationery,
  and when coupled with a sans etc.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\u2014B"

    idea if [[http://cm-unicode.sourceforge.net/|CMU Typewriter]] is to your palate.\r\n\r\nThere's
    also [[https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/|Liberation]] Mono and its big
    sib, [[http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/download-and-use-the-new-chrome-os-fonts-in-ubuntu/|ChromeOS
    Cousine]].\r\n\r\nHunting through the fixed-width/typewriter sections on DaFont
    and FontSquirrel will likely yield groans and grins.\r\n\r\nThen there's [[http://www.f25.cc/|F25
    Digital Typeface Design]], which has a few monospaced faces available. Might be
    too specialised, though."

    and very extensive in terms of weights and language support. And it is used to
    great effect in [[http://www.iawriter.com/|iA Writer]] on the iPad and OS X.
