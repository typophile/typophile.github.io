<p>hi there. square-enix (japan-based videogame company) used to be known as square co, producing games primary under the label &ldquo;squaresoft&rdquo; (most of the time logo&rsquo;s on one line).</p>
<p>what is the font used for this logo? the logo for &ldquo;square&rdquo; is the same minus the &ldquo;soft;&rdquo; both had the triangle area under the &lsquo;A&rsquo; filled with red. if this is a completely custom font, who designed it and where can i buy it? if this is a modification of an existing font, what was the base font? if it was simply some vector/postscript logo made in illustrator, coreldraw, or some other vector art app, i&rsquo;d be disappointed but at least i&rsquo;ll be glad to find out from where this logo came. i personally think it started out NOT italicized, but that&rsquo;s just my opinion&hellip;</p>
<p>(the intended usage is for one of my logos)</p>

<p>That aside, it&rsquo;s obviously a mangled font, a bold geometric sans probably. I suspect along the lines of Trade Gothic, Franklin Gothic, News Gothic or Basic Commercial. It&rsquo;s hard to say exactly since every letter was altered, then skewed and smooshed. It&rsquo;s also possible that the Q and O are just circles and the A a triangle, all of which were not part of the base font.</p>
<p>Aside from the atrocities this poor font was put through, I&rsquo;m impressed a game developing powerhouse would have kept and continued to use this logo for any amount of time. Then again, it was probably made by the president&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>to be fair, the image was created by myself using a fan-made font (NOT made by myself) that only had the letters contained in &ldquo;Squaresoft&rdquo; for lowercase and a mangled runic mt condensed for the uppers. that being said, yes, the O and Q are supposed to be circular, but the fan font was apparently made more poorly than i had anticipated. the actual logo that appears on their graphical materials is so much cleaner than this.</p>
<p>unfortunately, none of the fonts you suggested quite match up to the &lsquo;R,&rsquo; &lsquo;E,&rsquo; and &lsquo;F&rsquo; that to me is probably the visual trademark of the font. my very first research long ago turned up one of the &ldquo;futura&rdquo; family as a possible base, but that was a dead end as well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks lex for finding the actual logo. hopefully ppl will be able to get a better idea of what square originally intended (i guess).</p>
<p>an update on my latest research into it: i contacted square-enix usa&rsquo;s marketing dept to see if they could point me to the original designer. the woman i spoke to said the japanese office might know. given that i neither speak nor understand even close to enough japanese to carry on a convo w/SE japan, i asked her to forward my request and contact info to them. i have yet to hear back from either office.</p>
<p>as for the current square-enix logo, after WhatTheFont-ing it, i found out it&rsquo;s basically a mod of either bank gothic bt or banque gothique rr (either way, it&rsquo;s a mod; the Q and the E are the proof). i&rsquo;m not really in the mood to use bank gothic for anything special, but still, one down, one to go&hellip;</p>
