  a burlesque troupe and they need an identity done. I've done some internet browsing,
  but need more assistance on styles and maybe lettering examples that would be appropriate.
  My search here and keywording on MyFonts has not really come up with anything.\r\n\r\nThey
  are looking for a two letter ligature (the initials of their name) so I'd probably
  be using reference to draw something out by hand. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\np.s. I've been
  so busy the past few weeks getting/doing freelance that I literally said 'WOW!'
  when I opened up the home page. Love the new style of the site!"

    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cubanica/sailor-gothic/\">Sailor Gothic</a>
    and an Art Deco look. I ended up going in the Art Deco direction with illustration
    because it suited the show better \u2013\_there are many sub genres.\r\n\r\nTim"
