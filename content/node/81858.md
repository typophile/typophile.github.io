  mostly for students... nothing too serious or expensive.\r\n(You can see them here:
  [[http://www.facebook.com/themebags]])\r\n\r\nWe don't have a logo yet, and a website
  is soon to be made, so it's about time to make one! :)  Here's a version I'm pretty
  happy with, but would like to hear your comments/critique! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_novi_4012.jpg]\r\n\r\nEvery
  letter of the word \"theme\" is from a different typeface - it's kind of a concept
  'cause we'll have different themes, while the bags (apart from the illustration)
  will stay more or less the same.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: 'i prefer the direction of the bottom two, sans the bag handle. not needed
    imo. or maybe it''s the style of the handle i don''t dig. maybe if were a bit
    more uniform. nah, you don''t need the handle. '

  body: "I agree with Mauro, looking from your perspective at the moment the handle
    might remind you of a handle, but for someone else it could easily represent a
    cherry stem or a badly designed walking legs and etc. The bag I did was merely
    and idea inside my head and the box next to it was a result of intended reduction
    and abstraction of the actual bag/book, the final could be an outline of a box.
    You should experiment.  \r\n\r\nI still believe that the lowercase 'e' in 'theme'
    must be different and preferably set in a capital, as the current 'e' looks imbalanced
    with the rest letter. For some reason whenever I think of DIN, it reminds of rough
    surfaces; hence the choice of the particular font.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSB"

  body: "Based on the bags you've already made (and can be seen on the Facebook site
    it I'm not mistaken) this is my comment on your logo progression:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I
    think that logo with organic shaped bag handle is complementing your bag designs
    very well. It's different and when done correctly it implies on a bag anyway.
    I like that.</li>\r\n<li>Of all the logos presented here I like the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/81858#comment-463028\">older
    handle logo</a> as well as the latest one (a bit less)</li>\r\n<li>Handle-less
    version of the last logo isn't really working because it's too grungy and may
    be mistakenly related to skateboarding. /BAGS/ is also not very visible so I think
    it's not working.</li>\r\n<li>The linked older logo had the problem with /BAGS/
    because letters were too big and too strong and were competing with /THEME/ too
    much</li>\r\n<li>Type in the older logo (for the word /THEME/) is also a bit more
    feminine which I guess is your main target group or at least major target group.
    Latest logo is very youthful but more masculine</li>\r\n<li>Type for /BAGS/ in
    your last logo doesn't work for me. It's too light and stylistically not complementary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nBased
    on all these I would say that you should progress the older logo.\r\n\r\nA completely
    horizontal version will probably be more in line with the original logo to be
    put on the label flying out of stitched handle on the bag itself.\r\n\r\n@aluminum:
    Even though you've made valuable experiment with word contrast (so one dominates
    as it should) I don't think that right alignment works.\r\n\r\nAnd one last thought.
    Since we live in approx. the same territory and share some of the same history
    I think that culturally and the way that things progress around here I find your
    logo very nice, culturally appropriate, eco-oriented and contemporary. Very nice.
    Like it lots."

    because I did something similar for the Johnny holm band.\r\n\r\n DIN, although
    a very nice typeface has nothing to do with movies. May i suggest two alternative
    directions: \r\n\r\nFirst, there may be some interesting mark or logo made from
    the idea of combining a film strip with stitches Sort of like what you already
    have going on with that dotted line. \r\n\r\nSecond what if the type was that
    really tall narrow sort you see used on movie posters? To me I would find that
    observant and educated. \r\n\r\nI believe something subtle and clever would  work
    very well and reflect the movie theme idea quite well. \r\n"
