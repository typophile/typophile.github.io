body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I have several typefaces that include special characters like L
  slash, Eth, Dyet, etc. But in my software &#40;Quark 4.11, Freehand, 8, Photoshop
  5.5&#41; they are not available.  <BR>What&#39;s wrong? Do I need other keyboard
  settings, do I have to upgrade something &#40;I&#39;m still running under OS9.2.1&#41;?
  <BR>I would like to fix this, because typefaces with the Adobe Standard Coding don&#39;t
  show all the characters in my software.  <BR> <BR>Does anyone have some tips or
  suggestions? <BR> <BR>Thanx, <BR>Ren

    doesn&#39;t support the characters  <BR>you&#39;re mentioning &#40;eth, lslash,

  body: Basically, you need to use software that speaks Unicode. In some cases, this
    only helps if the OS also speaks Unicode fluently &#40;e.g. OS X&#41;. <BR> <BR>You
    cannot access these characters in any version of QuarkXPress up to and including
    6. Juergen Kurz recently said that they would add Unicode to QXP 7 &#40;at a cost
    of 18 engineers for 9 months&#41;. <BR> <BR>More recent versions of Freehand reportedly
    do Unicode &#40;may require OS X&#41;. Photoshop certainly does. Any version of
    InDesign does. Depending on the application you may need to change keyboard settings
    to enter these characters, or use the OS X character palette. In Illustrator CS
    and InDesign, you can use the built-in glyph palette. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: I have for instance the FF Seria by Martin Majoor. When I open in FOG with
    the original encoding it shows the Adobe Standard encoding with 338 characters.
    All the characters with accents work, but the eth, thorn, scaron, lslash, onequarter,
    mu, and more of these characters are not accessable for me. <BR>Why, when they
    are in, can&#39;t I access them? I&#39;ve looked in my keyboard setting, but I
    don&#39;t have an Iselandic or a Polish one. That might help by accessing the
    characters, I think. <BR> <BR>MacOSX and InDesign are coming up. Anyone have experiences
    whether these characters then d
