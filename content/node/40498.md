    was having rendering issues. Turns out it\u2019s just the new Featured Face.\r\n\r\nHonestly,
    I had a feeling following Meta Serif was going to be a difficult task. Like a
    birthday party magician having to follow after Cirque Du Soleil. Unless you start
    off by cutting yourself in half, you\u2019re screwed.\r\n\r\nSadly, Borges Titulo\u2019s
    first trick was closer to pick a card, any card...\r\n\r\n\r\nRicardo - I deleted
    my post... sorry I didn't notice your's first."
