  a diagram I'd come across showing how one organization deals with the intellectual
  property they used in a single project. It's not about font licenses, but shows
  how tricky it can be to keep track of what you're allowed to do with the stuff you
  license. I've now received permission to show the diagram to others:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lorp.org/font-eula/uk_flood_map_ip_hierarchy.png\r\n\r\nSteve
  Coupe, the presenter of the talk during which this slide was shown, commented how
  keeping track of the IP was too complex just to \"keep in your head\". I'd be interested
  to hear people's comments on how this may relate to organizations and individual
  graphic designers licensing type.\r\n\r\nThe project the diagram refers to is the
  UK Flood Map, an interactive map on the website of the UK Environment Agency:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/subjects/flood/826674/829803/?version=1&lang=_e\r\n\r\nClick
  on Flood Map to see if you're at risk!\r\n\r\n-- Laurence\r\n"

  body: "Laurence, that is very scary. I assume that given time those that must can
    read that map without too much difficulty. However, the key is the getting of
    the time. Anyone new to that system must hate it. \r\n\r\nAre you keen to make
    a sample image for EULAs? Do you think something this complicated is really necessary?
    I'd really like to see what you are thinking, or maybe how you think this type
    of chart would translate over to keeping track of IP."

  body: "The idea is not to have one of these diagrams per EULA. The diagram shows
    how the UKEA kept track of IP in one web project. Each box represents a license
    agreement. The arrows show how the restrictions cascade down to the final systems:\r\n*
    the red Flood Map box (that's the main web project)\r\n* the yellow NaFRA 2004
    Foodline Database box\r\n* the yellow NaFRA 2004 Postcode Database box\r\n* the
    yellow Flood Watch Areas box.\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can make an example diagram
    for a real-sounding design project, which will make more sense and perhaps be
    less scary!"

  body: thanks, lorp. -- i like the idea of taking the graph from my aricle a step
    further. do you think it oversimplifies? i realize the graph and your chart are
    to different things. could they integrate somehow?

  body: "Thanks lorp, I remember you mentioning this diagram. Is this unusual practise
    for this field, or would we expect, say GoogleEarth to have a similar diagram?\r\n\r\nI
    know that the company I word for (e-learning for galleries, museums, libraries
    and archives) has a nightmare tracking licence dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf there was
    a standard interface for EULA properties, independant of what the object the license
    covers, that would be neat :) Then the property files could just be throw into
    a folder together and we could let a program map the relationships for us."
