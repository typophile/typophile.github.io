    body: "Hi there!\r\nWe started looking around for every existing solution, but
      photofont tools and specifications did not meet our requirements.\r\n\r\nWe
      first developed the project for our own uses, but we now we really want to share
      because of the new exciting possibilities. But we will rather have an open-minded
      vision than a proprietary approach."

  body: I am guessing that they have a photofont-like tool. The difference is that
    their solution runs on the web and might be added to Adobe tools - whereas Photofonts
    have a plug in but as far as I know doesn't have a web based implementation yet.
    I am sure Adam will know however...

  body: 'The demo is very interesting. For good or bad, it seems to be loading a jpg
    image of the text into the browser, so it''s not really rendering the fonts locally.
    This might have some very interesting uses, particularly where one wants broad
    browser support and the ability to limit access to the text. '

  body: "Our main goal was to achieve the chaotic aspect of a realistic drawing tool
    and the emotion of a human handwriting!!! So we skipped the vector approach (loss
    of detail, greyscales, no color and inappropriate existing tools). We also wanted
    to have an unlimited number of versions for each letter or ligatures. And since
    Opentype features programming was also a lot of pain, we went our own way, much
    easier one ;-)\r\n\r\nNow, we can also add specific \"behaviors\" to fonts and
    letters (\xE0la kerning pairs, special ligatures replacement, and new ideas too...),
    that do not exist on current font formats.\r\n\r\nWe have developed our own tools
    not only to work on print projects, but we are also porting the interactive editors
    to the web. You can try our first demos, so our system can easily be implemented
    in any existing website (no plugin). For more interactions between type and the
    user, there will be a much more flexible and playful version too..."

  body: "This is cool, but, really, nothing new. Rendering text as images via a web
    server has been around for quite a while.\r\n\r\nWhile this is fun, for true web
    use, it's not ideal, as image based text just isn't as accessible...which is a
    primary benefit of using the web.\r\n\r\nThat said, you could improve upon this
    a bit by making sure that you also render appropriate alt attributes for the images
    that are created. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm thinking GIF files would likely be a better
    option for type.\r\n\r\nBTW, the hand-rendered typefaces are lovely and I'm sure
    there's a market for this."
