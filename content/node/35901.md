    Script>School</a> or Script >Handwritten? (Sample images there seem to be down
    right now). If you didn't find it in Part 12 of my Guide, then that's the next
    place I'd suggest. \r\n\r\nHowever, our <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/#Q_15\">FAQ
    #15</a> statement about hand-printed fonts applies to this sort of font as well.
    It could be a personal font or one off font, that you will never locate. My suggestion
    is to pick something similar and go with that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
