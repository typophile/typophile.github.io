body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI was wondering if someone can point me in the right direction.
  \r\n\r\nI'm trying to create a line of circles that get smaller and smaller from
  one side to the other so that the left one starts at 25px for example, and the the
  last one on the other side is 1px by the end, and X many steps in between.\r\n\r\nThis
  is what I tried.\r\n\r\n1. 4000px X 500px art board\r\n2. Draw Circle on left edge.
  \r\n3. Duplicate Circle from #2 on right edge. \r\n4. Blend across smooth. \r\n5.
  Isolate the last object (right hand circle)\r\n6. Transform it to scale it down
  by 90%. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that the circles on the left start to stack on top
  of each other rather than remain where they were as they get smaller.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "What application?\r\n\r\nIn CorelDraw, I'd draw the two originating circles,
    then scale the right one. Then blend them. Then break apart and ungroup all the
    objects. Then select them all and Distribute with the \"spacing\" option selected.
    But I guess you probably mean Illustrator?"

  body: Thank you, I was able to accomplish what I needed.  I was looking for something
    more automated and it was easier just to replicate it.
