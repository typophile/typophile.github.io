  at Sint-Lucas Ghent (Belgium). This year I have to write a thesis and I chose Comic
  Sans as my subject. I will mainly investigate the social aspects of the font: the
  reasons why so many people use it and so few designers like it. Offcourse I've never
  used Comic Sans, but for my thesis I am looking for great designers who did, with
  or without a twist of irony. \r\n\r\nI've heard that Will Holder used it one time,
  but I can't find visual material on the web about it or in books. There's also Gorik
  Lindemans who made posters for the dance production Rosas (by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker)
  and was inspired by the colours of an ad for Aldi (a cheap supermarket), I can't
  find this poster either.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where I can find these or are you
  a Comic Sans expert and do you know other designers who used it in a good way?\r\n\r\nThe
  tips would be very welcome,\r\nThank you in advance,\r\n\r\nLiesbeth "

  body: "Usages of Comic Sans abound but what is your thesis statement?  You could
    gather some anecdotal information of funny or hideous uses of the typeface (tee
    hee, <em>look at this example</em> kind of stuff,) but what are you trying to
    define? Finding examples will only ratify its usage in almost any context you
    want to refer to. \r\n\r\nSome of its existence and prolific usage is because;\r\nIt
    is owned by Microsoft,\r\nIt is a default typeface on a couple of Microsoft programs,\r\nIt
    is readable at small sizes for dialog on computer screens,\r\nIt is free.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, why is a typeface like <strong><em>Coop Forged</em></strong> by
    House Industries [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=12&subpage=viewfontspecimens|view
    here,]] used so little? It is similar as maybe a dozen other comic-looking fonts.
    The argument my boil down to\u2026it's not a default, not common and not free?\r\n\r\nA
    defined thesis statement will focus your intention, or what you are really trying
    to discover."

    <em>I</em> at the top of their tool bar for incorrect alternates such as <strong>Bold</strong>
    or <em>Italic</em> anyway. Right now, the thesis argument is not stated. Anyone
    that owns a computer has free access to Comic Sans, therefore, someone is going

  body: 'Think of Comic Sans like this: Two people need to traverse across a large
    public park. Lets just assume that dogs are also allowed off leash to roam, play
    fetch or do their thing, there may be a few geese or other wildlife, etc. With
    those two people, one walks across while wearing utility boots, the other person,
    just in their bare feet while carrying their flip-flops. One person will be more
    concerned as to where they step while traveling to the other side while the other
    person possibly could care less. Both make it to the other side but one has more
    probability to really stink when they hop onto some public transit at the other
    side of the park. It is the same concept. It (Comic Sans,) is out there, it is
    possible to <em>step in</em> and you may stink if you don''t care how you get
    to the destination.'

  body: "First of all, thanks for all the reactions.\r\n\r\nsecond, I shall explain
    the sentence quoted a couple of times above: \r\n\r\n'offcourse i've never used
    comic sans'.\r\n\r\n I said that as a graphic design student who never dared to
    use it because it's such a difficult typeface to use in an art-environment. I
    can understand that comic sans is appropriate for applied graphic design, for
    example a hairdresser's shop (i picked this one because i've seen one with CS
    in the logo). At school during practice, it's easier to use typefaces that are
    allready proven to be good ones like Didot, Futura, Baskerville, Garamond, Univers,
    all the big names in typeworld. I think the only way to use comic sans (and in
    a design approved by my teachers :)) is in a design that refers to the commercial
    world and uses it's elements but without just copying them. There has to be an
    additional value. And layered meanings. Irony is not necessarily a part of it.\r\nThis
    way of adopting elements of the 'low culture' can also be seen with other artists:
    Arne Sierens (http://www.arnesierens.be/)is a playwright who's stories are situated
    in for example fastfood restaurants, but his plays are considdered art because
    of the layers and the additional value. Also designer Walter Van Beirendonck (http://www.waltervanbeirendonck.com/)
    adopts elements of low culture and gives them a new meaning. It's in this way
    i would like to find some famous graphic designers who used comic sans, but i
    haven't found one yet. Maybe at the end of this year i myself can design something
    good with comic sans.\r\n\r\nAnd about my thesis statement: \r\n\r\ni'm still
    just researching and i'm following different paths at the same time. But i think
    i will mostly investigate the social aspects of the type: which people use it
    and for which purposes? which are the motives of the persons who use it? the things
    that are said by skinny_tires are indeed some of the important reasons of the
    popularity of comic sans, but even if we just look at the fonts delivered with
    every computer, comic sans is still the most popular. Is it, as some organisations
    who researched dyslectia say, the best readable type? is it good for children
    who are just learning to read? \r\n\r\nI hope you all get a nicer image of me
    and my thesis :) I haven't got the intention of turning my thesis in a freakshow
    to tell everyone how bad and ugly comic sans is. I want to investigate comic sans
    properly and if the solution is that comic sans a bad font is, then be it. But
    up to now, 'i believe in comic sans' (this is also my working titel of my masterproject)"
