  body: Isn't just a phone enough? I assume that every hotel offers telephone service,
    but if not, then make a phone with a $ for those that charge, and a phone w/o
    for the free ones.

  body: "It depends on what language this will be in, and how tongue-in-cheek you
    want to get. Since English has no distinction between <cite>gratis</cite> and
    <cite>libre</cite> - both are \"free\" - you could depict a phone with wings flying
    out of a birdcage (that is if it is an English brochure and you are allowed to
    get a little cute with it).\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    with a raised handset in an inviting way. I think this will do fine since the

    though, if you were allowed to use the letters; \"24hr\" in one icon, why just
    not use the word \"free\" above the phone... free phone.\r\n\r\nPictograms are
    freaking hard i reckon. \r\n\r\n"
