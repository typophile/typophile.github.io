  of stuff, mostly math/computer science/physics/biotech. I'm not here to boast though,
  I've been working with several of my friends, full-time designers on the company's
  typography, as I am an amateur typophile.\r\n\r\nAll the proposal's that my friends
  came up with, were sans-serifs, stuff like you can see Nokia, Google, etc. do. \r\n\r\nMy
  question for you is - do you think sans-serif font is the only possible option to
  express the ideas of doing research, the lightness of knowledge etc? Can one design
  a typographical identity of a research company based on a serif font? It seems to
  be a trend - everywhere in Poland universities are redesigning their logos abandoning
  old serif typefaces to sans-serif's.\r\n\r\nCan one find a serif font that would
  embody the modernity, innovative and light feeling of research, without looking
  old-fashioned and depreciated? What do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Google uses a serif (although I guess they use a sans-serif as their secondary
    typeface for all of their various web apps).\r\n\r\nI think one of the reasons
    we tend to associate serifs (as a genre, which is problematic, but I will get
    to that) with stuffiness is that most of the serifs that are included with our
    OSes and bundled with Adobe CS are very much based on more classical letterforms,
    and are more apt for setting text rather than display work. This is fine; if you're
    going to have typefaces bundled with your software you want them to be workhorses.\r\n\r\nBut
    check out FontShop's Type Trends 2010 page: http://www.fontshop.com/blog/?cat=76
    . Notice how the serifs are chunkier and more apt for the kind of display work
    you're looking at. They don't seem stuffy at all. I think if you look at some
    of the more recent serifs, you may find what you are looking for.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I guess what I'm really saying is that slab serifs are what you're looking for.
    But not stuff like Rockwell or Clarendon \u2014 you want the more humanist forms
    of recently-released slabs."

    some damned red brunette might make you forget all about the current theory. Just
    keep your eyes peeled, your knowledge light."

    one remembers that \"ITC\" style from the 1970s, e.g. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pacella/\">Pacella</a>,
