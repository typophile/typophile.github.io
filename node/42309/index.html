  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey What's up typhophilians!!

My buddy asked me to create a logo for him. He makes hip hop/R&B beats. I always have a problem designing for people I know on a personal level, I tend to over think about what direction to go because I know them and I want to blow their minds. Attach are a few layout of the same type treatment. Let me know how that looks and see what way to go. By the way the name of his company is REDTHM (rhythm) I know he uses RED in it. should I use "RED"(color) in the logo or keep it neutral? Holla at yo boi,,. I am also attaching an icon and T-Shirt I designed for him.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/redthm_logo_6116.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/redthm_icon_4888.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/redthm_tshirt_5569.jpg]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't believe "red" has to be in red, especially since it will visually break the word into two words red & thm (or sort of words). The box around the logotype bothers me on the smaller scale versions (paired with the drum head skull and the veggies) the negative space above and to the right of the "m" is distracting. maybe it needs to be optically centered and not actually centered. The drum head skull guy is cute and I like him. But is cute the look that best suits your friend's work? The style looks like "Hello Kitty" goes goth/urban. Admittedly I'm old and this may be stereotypical, but usually when people are pairing a skull with music they're going for an edgier look. Not to say that's what you should do - certainly going along with the trend just for trends sake is not what I'm suggesting. I'm just asking is this style appropriate for your friend? And I'm afraid I just don't get the stippled drawing of the beats. The drawing goes so against the other style you were creating. If I saw that alone I would think it is for an organic farmer and instead of being called green thumb the company is redthm (red thumb - that their hands are stained by manually picking their beats). That drawing, especially on the brown has a '70's folk music sensibility. And the "I heart beats" shirt makes me think you love the English Beat. Why wasn't it "I heart redthm"? The different styles are all over the place, are you trying to show your friend's eclectic style? If that's the case I still think what you have so far doesn't accomplish your goal. Don't try to blow your friend's mind. Try to nail who he is, and what he does, in your logo. Accomplish that and you will blow his mind.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your input. I am going for the hip urban Los Angeles feel. I guess I will just show this to him and wait to get a better understanding of what he wants. He's an urban outfitters knuckle head, so I thought of going in an urban sheik type of look.

		<div class="commentbody">First off, I LOVE the tape t-shirt. It reminds me of a t-shirt design I did a couple years ago for an "old-school" MTV-themed event.

As for the redthm logo, I understand the difficulty of doing an L.A. urban feel because it has to be funky and chic at the same time (I suppose that would be called "funky fresh?") I'm a big Urban Outfitters fan, so I can definitely see where you're going with it. I would try going even funkier. The wordmark is kinda blah for a hiphop artist that wants to distinguish himself from the rest of the scene. Of course I'm an east coast hiphop scenester, so my perception is a little different.

This is a real tough one... I'll probably post again once I sleep on it.</div>

I like the first mark the best, but the letter spacing seems off.  I'd say - avoid red.</div>
