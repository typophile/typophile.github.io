  body: "I'm afraid your 3 could easily be mistaken for a 5 and your D could be a
    zero. Also, the perspective angles of the 3D effect are too extreme so it actually
    looks as if the figures are slightly twisted, and the top of 3 is falling backwards
    a bit. I'd keep the angle consistent, like a traditional archictural drawing.
    Look up isometric, axonometric and oblique projection if you're not familiar with
    technical drawing.\r\n\r\nI think the look is a bit too '90s techno for an architectural
    firm."

  body: "The angle of the 3 confuses me; is it a wonky 3? Is it a 5? \r\nI must admit
    mahmoudhassan's top idea provides a less confusing and more satisfying solution.\r\n"

  body: hey, i recently designed an architecture logo and had a similar approach.
    i found this in my preliminary ideas. modified it a bit and added a stem for the
    3 and cut into it to read more clearly. not saying use this one, but my thought
    was to use the space of a floor plan. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/3d_5596.jpg]

  body: "Hola, nice belt buckle!  \r\n\r\nmahmoudhassan, I think you need to go back
    to the brief and work on concept development more.  It seems like you are trying
    to make the letters 3D into a 3D form, which lacks conceptual connection to architecture,
    and seems a bit too obvious.  Try to dive into what makes the company unique,
    great, or memorable, and find concepts that capture that feeling or idea.  Hope
    that helps!"

  body: no. i'm not the original poster of this thread. i did however recently design
    an architecture logo and thought it might help mahmaudhassan see that 3D doesn't
    have to look 3D. why do you ask alaskan?

  body: Mahmoud needs to come back and explain a bit more about the company. I think
    they might not be architects themselves but they do 3D modelling for architects,
    in which case it probably is three dimensions rather than architecture they need
    to convey, plus they have a very specific target audience.
