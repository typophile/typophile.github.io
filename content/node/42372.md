  the services of adoption agency... they do foreign and domestic adoption, as well
  as, homestudies.  Great people.. very personable and professional (warm).\r\n\r\nThe
  font will be on a flashed website that includes testimonials in video and all the
  documentation etc.\r\n\r\nThanks for any/all input. :-)\r\n\r\n~ wnf"

  body: "The lighter weights of ITC Century might fit the bill. It's a traditional
    serif with a modern gloss and echoes of Century Schoolbook, which middle-age American
    audiences associate with childhood reading textbooks.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_century/\r\n\r\nOr
    perhaps a neo-Didot like Filosofia (Emigre) or Donatora (TypeTrust).\r\n\r\nhttp://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=97\r\nhttp://www.typetrust.com/font/donatora"
