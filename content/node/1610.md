  body: I was scrambling like mad to find that thread about  <BR>the theatre company
    you work for. I knew you used it  <BR>for a poster, and someone asked you what
    face  it was. <BR> <BR>&#40;One would wonder what use it has to remember all  <BR>these
    silly details when you can&#39;t even remember the  <BR>most important thing,
    being the name of the font...&#41;

  body: 'Thanks, Yves -- good memory. And good sleuthing, Franz! <BR> <BR>A postscript:
    I settled on Neil Summerour&#39;s Aaux, and I&#39;ve been really happy with it,
    as has the rest of the company. You can see what I&#39;ve been doing with it at
    the <a href="http://www.impacttheatre.com">website</a>. <BR> <BR>Plus Neil is
    just about to release &#40;if he hasn&#39;t done so already&#41; small caps/OSFs
    as well as heavier weights.'
