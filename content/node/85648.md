  a font where you can connect all the letters with each other. It didn't really became
  that but I continued working on it anyway. \r\n\r\nThe 'grid' is build from circles
  divided in four pieces. I added circles until I could make all letterforms. Vertical
  strokes where added but no horizontal strokes because this would removed the 'flow'
  from the font. (For the capitals I did add horizontal strokes but used as many curved
  forms as I could. This all resulted in the 'grid' (second image) witch I used to
  build all the letters from.\r\n\r\nThis is the result, any tips, feedback is really
  appreciated.\r\nDownload available under the post.\r\n\r\nCheers Heyman\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "I like it, but I think you could actually completely remove all the horizontal
    strokes from the capitals to make something more interesting. \r\n\r\nI'd reconsider
    the ascender on the /d/.\r\n\r\n/v/, /w/, and /z/ seem alien to me."

  body: "Hi Bendy,\r\nThanks voor your critique! I added the horizontal strokes because
    otherwise the capitals would be very narrow. I could also change the curve on
    the capitals, keeping them wider but still with a circle shape. I'll try that,
    I'll make the narrow version as well.\r\n\r\nThe /d/ was an idea i got from old
    gothic /d/ shapes but i guess that's not showing.\r\n\r\nI agree on the /v/ /w/
    and /z/. But should I complete leave the grid?\r\nThanks again!\r\n  "

  body: "Heyman,\r\n\r\nNice work! However I do think that when a font is made from
    such a rigid geometric system, it loses some of the personality characteristics
    that would otherwise really help it stand out.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend exploring
    at least 1-2 more treatments and infuse those in, especially in the awkward shapes
    that Bendy pointed out. Be brave! Leave the grid, or better yet, find another
    piece of the design vocabulary that still somehow fits with the grid you've created,
    and conveniently solves the awkward moments.\r\n\r\nYour font will be better off
    for it.\r\n\r\n"
