		<div class="commentbody">I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend using a local printer <em>instead</em> of a cheep web vendor for the following reasons:

a) It is important to patronize your local economy
b) If the printer makes a mistake, such as poor registration, your chances of getting a reprint at no charge is much greater.
c) You will develop a real relationship with a real person which, over time, has many benefits. For example, when you have been working with the same printer for 20 years, they will often do you small favours that other printers normally wouldn’t (deals, turnaround &c).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Christopher's comments.  An additional advantage is that a local printer has actual paper samples to inspect and choose from. Also you can discuss your job with a real live person and they can point out any potential technical problems with your layout.

I'd suggest using a small (but good) print shop. (Not a copy shop that does mostly xeroxing, but a real, full-service print shop.) A big print shop that's geared towards large jobs would probably not be an economical choice for printing a few hundred business cards.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">And as I get older I am increasingly impressed with the quality/capabilities of digital presses which are essentially bus-sized colour photocopiers. Nothing to turn your nose up at. Cheep, fast <em>and</em> high quality. They can handle pretty beefy stock as well. Most important is to find a good contact and person to work with. Respect their knowledge.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Visit a local shop, preferably a small to medium printer with with a 2 and 4 color press. They'll often have a customer base that you'll fall into and can bang out that card in a few days.

Also, when using a local printer, you get to explore and feel different types of stock.

Digital printing is much better nowadays in terms of color and quality (sometimes), but the backup is still a shotgun approach. Because you are printing both sides, you will want offset printing to get that backup exact, especially so if you have borders and artwork near the edge. 

Finally with digital printing, you won't get any coating. That's important with business cards because they'll be pushed into wallets and the color may rub.</div>
