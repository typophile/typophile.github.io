  body: "\"BTW, how\u2019s your voice?\"\r\n\r\nDavid, I haven't been able to do any
    singing since last Fall due to a combination of health issues but hope to start
    back soon.  With this much layoff, I am sure I will need work on my high notes.
    I think the low notes are still there, though, so I will soon be back to Don Giovanni
    and reprise my Leporello role.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    with Georgia added for some occasional spice. But that really turns me on again.
    I had the opposite reaction to seeing Moderno on Typophile as I had on April 1st.
    (Not only are you guys not crazy, you're pretty sharp.)\r\n\r\nThanks ChrisL.
    And what music would you set that to?"

    sing much? I know your brother Mark does opera... I even saw him in HMS Pinafore

  body: Thomas -- No, no. Just around the office. You know. I leave the professional
    singing and opera to Mark. Although, I don't think he's gotten plugged into much
    around there yet. He did a fair bit when he was down in the Bay Area.

    a fantastic pianist and works with several opera singers. For my 59th birthday,
    she gave me voice lessons with a family friend and I have been hooked ever since!
    Since I was working on the role of Leporello a few years ago, I named my first
    typeface after the character as well as the vanity plate on my car :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
