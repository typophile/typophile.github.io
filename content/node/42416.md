  C E A F (half note trill) - (quarter notes)\r\nE D C B A (eighth notes)\r\n\r\nthen
  it repeats.\r\n\r\nIt was used in cartoons a as creeping or lurking melody. My wife
  seems to think that Sylvester the Puddy Tat used to creep along to it.\r\n\r\nIt
  is truly a ridiculous question so I'm asking, you should expect nothing less.\r\n\r\nClues
  so far are Carl Stalling (a composer for Hanna Barbera) and the song title Myserioso
  - perhaps with a i instead of a y.\r\n\r\nY'all have heard it enough times to not
  pay any attention to this post, yet I am on a quest\u2026 -:)\r\n\r\ntia\r\n\r\npbc"

    sure it's been on some Warner Bros cartoons, but it's not confined to them or
    cartoons in general.  As to what it's called or where it's been taken from -  wow,
    I'm not sure.  I'll look into it.  What's the relevance to fonts though?  Not
    that it matters to me.\r\n\r\nps, the last A is actually the first of A of the
    sequence.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: Is the F held longer? I can hear the song but can't help you trace it, other
    than to offer the correction that Carl Stalling composed for Warner Bros. Looney
    Tunes cartoons, not Hanna Barbera.

  body: "You are referring to the \"villain's theme\" from the days of silent film.
    To the best of my knowledge, it's one of those things with no certain credited
    origin. It appears to be available in a pure form on <A HREF=\"http://www.amazon.com/Silent-Film-Music-Al-Webber/dp/B000003LD2/\">this
    album by Al Webber</A>.\r\n\r\nA version I can recommend is <A HREF=\"http://www.amazon.com/Two-Pianos-Are-Better-Than/dp/B000003D0F/\">\"The
    Musical Sacrifice\" by P.D.Q. Bach</A> (Peter Schickele), which uses the theme
    to parody J.S. Bach's \"A Musical Offering.\""

  body: There is a really great collection of music from Warner Bros. cartoons that
    was released a few years ago called The Carl Stalling Project. The recordings
    are from the original sessions and most don't include additional dialog or sound
    effects--just the music. I don't recall if the "villian's theme" is in there but
    there are a lot of other recognizable tunes. The liner notes go into the background
    of where the music came from. I was pleased to learn that my all-time favorite
    tune from the WB cartoons has a name--"<a href="<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerhouse_(song)">Powerhouse</a>".
