  a few different searches for this serif font, but have yet to find the matching
  font.  It appears to have equal width on both sides and most of the closely matched
  fonts, the left side of the A is significantly thinner than the right side of the
  A.  Any ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A Halo_4487.jpg]"
