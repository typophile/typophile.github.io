  Radim Pesko but it has some alternative characters.\r\nI believe it is the one used
  for Y-3 by Peter Saville as well.\r\n\r\nThank you![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Animation_S5_Website-16-(dragged)_3678.jpg]"

  body: "I think you're both right that it is L\xFFno. :) On the useful web page,
    press the \"character set\" button and chose between the four variant typefaces,
    all of these glyphs are present in at least one."
