body: hi guys im new to the forum i discovered you while doing research for my dissertation
  and i was wondering if anyone could help me out? Basically im a masters degree student
  and im trying to prove that the abolition of german black letter in 1941 was due
  to its ilegibility and not the associations with 'jewishness'. If anyone knows any
  good source material or could be of any help it would be seriously appreciated.
  Thank You

    who were not used to it? (for example in the conquered territories)\r\nI think
    it is pretty obvious that the latter was the reason to ban blackletter typefaces.
    But I don't know how one could ever really prove this unless one would find some
    secret diary pages of Hitler."

    document I link to there is very good but in German, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nI have
    indeed read that Fraktur was abolished because in 1941 the Nazis were more or
    less expecting to rule the world some day and wanted to facilitate the spread
    of the German language. Can't remember the source, though."

  body: Sorry i never have been very good at making myself clear so this dissertation
    is doomed from the start lol anyway what i meant was that my dissertation is centered
    around the use of blackletter within german propaganda and why it was abolished
    when it appeared so parallel with the german national identity. I have read many
    sources stating that the true reason was that conquering nations were having trouble
    with its legibility but this seems unlikely when you consider that it had been
    a political issue since the early 1900's and it been brought before parliament
    to make roman type the standard in 1911 and failed. I guess what im asking for
    really is if anyone knows a source that gives a contrasting view prehaps that
    'judenlettern' or jewish arguement or maybe theres another view that i am not
    yet aware of? or an account that seems to give a realistic study and outcome?

  body: "Stringent proof that the abolition of the Blackletter had nothing to do with
    a connotated jewishness might not be easy to find, although this seems to be a
    valid point of view.\r\n\r\nI have never looked deep into this subject (I can't
    tell you anything you don't already know), but what came to my mind when I read
    your question is the 'script decree' by Martin Bormann (who then was Director
    of the NSDAP party headquarters) from January 1941. It says that the Gothic script
    had wrongly been considered German and that it actually was composed of 'Schwabacher
    Jew letters' and hence not to be used any longer, especially not by authorities,
    in school books or in German magazines and newspapers that already were or planned
    to be syndicated outside of Germany. Hans Heinrich Lammers (head of the Reich
    Chancellery), who passed the decree on, described its rationale slightly differently
    (without a reference to an alleged 'jewishness'): the use of the (wrongly named)
    Gothic script would disservice German interests, as many aliens in and outside
    of Germany who could understand German could not read Blackletter.\r\n\r\nWhen
    Hitler displayed an aversion against the Gothic script at the 1934 Reichsparteitag
    (Nuremberg Rally), he argued that once German had become the language of Europe,
    it would be easier to learn for other peoples when written in Latin script. AFAIR,
    he made no connection between Gothic script and 'jewishness'.\r\n\r\nI only scanned
    it quickly, but the PDF linked to by Tim (www.peterrueck.ch/pdf/sprache%20der%20schrift.pdf)
    seems to be a qualified and exhaustive disquisition of the 1941 Blackletter ban."

    to ask my typographer teacher about the subject. He's addicted to type. Just throwing
    this out there though...ANYTHING to do with that era is generally shunned and
    avoided. So the colors Black and Red are a big no no in design. (Found this out
    the hard way)

  body: "Currently the best source of answers is Silvia Hartmann's dissertation <cite>Fraktur
    oder Antiqua: Der Schriftstreit von 1881 bis 1941</cite> which includes an exhaustive
    section of facsimiles from primary sources, including dozens of argumentative
    letters in 1941 between the BfdS and the Reich authorities, featuring a depressingly
    escalating appeal to antisemitism from both sides as the BfdS's desperation increased.
    Really, it's breathtaking how absurdly all-consuming the antisemitism became in
    every piddly policy spat. The Jews were just a disposable excuse to justify every
    single random whim inside a growing autocracy that fostered and rewarded magical
    thinking.\r\n\r\n(The closer one looks at this, the more prophetic Franz Kafka's
    writing seems.)\r\n\r\nBlackletter was a minor casualty compared to the countless
    humans. That it should needlessly remain a casualty, however, is nonetheless sad
    and absurd. The evil men in charge first embraced this beautiful art form that
    had evolved over centuries and claimed it as their own, only to destroy it, just
    like they did the same to Germany itself and a great portion of its rightful citizens."
