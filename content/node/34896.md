body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nThe Politics magazine The Economist does is a special serif
  font designed for them named Eco.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/eco-101/\r\n\r\nHowever
  I could not help to notice that is looks very much alike some classic serif modern
  font but I cannot remember the name. Any help on this?\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way, did
  anybody saw The Econommist Magazine, three column page design with this font and
  the very tight leading? I do like the design but the leading so tight make it hard
  to read for me. What do you think? Most Economy and Political magazine, like Time
  and Newsweek use the same format.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help and best,\r\nSebastiao"

    the italic reminds me of Palatino or maybe <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-quadraat/>FF
    Quadraat.</a>\r\nEdit: on second glance, the Swift resemblance is maybe not as
    strong as I thought it was."

  body: Are you looking at a new <em>Economist</em>? [[Erik Spiekermann]] <a href="http://www.spiekermann.com/mten/2007/01/itc_officina.html">redesigned
    it in 2001</a> and added more leading as well as updated the typeface. I was just
    looking at a comparison somewhere on the web but now I can't find it.
