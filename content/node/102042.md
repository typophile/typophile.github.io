    main thing I'm dying to find out is, are they actually generating OTFs on-the-fly
    (I would just keel over and die) or do they have all 1320 (if my math is correct)

    \ It is very easy to parameterize chirography (note how their difference between
    strong/weak contrast is just about strokes with slants like | or \\ ).  Very few
    people have a clue how to properly parameterize \u201Ctwo-sided\u201D strips of
    paint\u2026\r\n\r\nOne exception I know is http://www.typophile.com/node/73827.\r\n"

    of that exception. If <em>one</em> person can do that, fewer people should do
    it the other way.\r\n\r\nOne key idea BTW is to see letterforms as <em>not</em>
    things with painted bodies, but things with drawn borders, as instances of notan.
    However, an interesting hybrid: http://typophile.com/node/31095\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    read it slightly differently: if <em>only one</em> person could do it this way,
    it makes much more sense to look at the other ways to do it.  And: as far as 31095
    went, my impression was that nobody got any idea what your point was\u2026  Me
    neither."

    my drift (even if few of them saw much practical use in it). John Hudson for example
    tried to help me explain to Michael \"Two Coats\" Clark that there's a fundamental
    difference between the work of Salden and Okano. In fact here's some evidence

    \ You giving (explicit or explicit) positive remarks about <strong>two</strong>

    and I\u2019m very interested in its provenance w.r.t. http://typophile.com/node/31095
    \u2014 but it is clearly pure chirography.  A glyph consists of two parts: a flourish,
    which is a single chirographic line; and the skeleton, which (according to my
    very cursory inspection) is an algorithmic expansion of the character's spine
    (so it is also chirographic).  (I find it very helpful to imagine that what you
    see in the skeleton is two edges of a 3D band going about the spine and twisting
    as needed.  Of course, after you can see it as this, it is very easy to describe
    the transformation as a 2D operation too.  This 3Dness is somewhat similar to
    one of [[Calypso PF free download|Calypso]].)\r\n\r\n> <em>Hmmm, so what proportion

    do not know.  Anyway, I find it completely irrelevant.\r\n\r\n> <em>You want easy?
    Don't make fonts. :-)</em>\r\n\r\nI do not want it easy \u2014 unless it <strong>can</strong>
    be done algorithmically.  What I want is results, and results yesterday.\r\n\r\nWhile
    it is obvious that designing one edge of a stroke separately from the other edge
    of a stroke allows one more freedom, it is also obvious that this more or less
    prohibits parametrization.  And where I live, optical scaling is a must; other
    types of parametrization are also of great use.  So unless you design your font
    for the audience used to the character repertoire of a non-IBM typewriter, you
    will not have resources to manually design separate flavors.\r\n\r\nAlso, I cannot
    omit that in certain endeavours, more freedom gives worse results than less freedom.
    \ Remember: when people have an especially  complicated message to transmit, sometimes
    they choose verses and not prose.  (Same happens in math: for many topics, a free-style
    discourse turns out to be less comprehensible than a strictly formal one \u2014
    I wrote something on this tune [[http://ilyaz.org/interview|here]].  But, frankly
    speaking, I know no typographic examples of this.)\r\n"
