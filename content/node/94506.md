body: "Hello all. I need to identify this font from a client's logo - the letters
  I've included in the samples are the only ones I have. Looks like a classic face,
  almost Garamond-style. The centers of the serifs curve in slightly, the oval dots
  above the i's are severely rotated and almost touching the bottom of the letter,
  and the bar of the lowercase e is angled as well.\r\n\r\nThe client said they think
  the font is \"James\", but I can't locate that font. Any help would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n<img
