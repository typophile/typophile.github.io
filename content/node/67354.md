body: "I recently came across some software with which you can easily make additional
  weights and styles for your font. I don't know if you have to trace your font again
  in the program or that it just uses your original vector points. In any case, the
  software was incredibly expensive, there was no trial version and I couldn't find
  a place to download it to try it out, so I forgot the name of it.\r\n\r\nThat aside,
  I'm actually wondering how you make your additional weights and styles. Do you draw
  them manually or do you use software for it? If it's the latter, which? Is it also
  possible in Fontlab Studio 5? If it's the former, is there a source that describes
  the process to do it appropriately? Manually making weights and styles seems an
  awful lot of work, while the process of making a single font is incredibly time
  consuming already."

    judgments, and combined with rounding errors generated letters get ugly quickly.
    Using tools like KLTF Glyph Tweaker will allow you to add or remove weight and
    width while maintaining contrast, but there are limits to what it can do. For
    example, you can go from a regular weight to a rough start on a bold weight, but
    if you try to jump to a black weight it\u2019s going to take as much time to clean
    it up as it would to just draw it. It is also much easier to add weight than to
    take it away, because once you start pushing strokes in on themselves all the
    computer can do is overlap them. \r\n\r\nExtrapolation/interpolation tools are
    a great way to flesh out a family after you already have a few fonts drawn. Font
    Remix Tools, Superpolator, and UFOStretch can really speed stuff up, but if you\u2019re
    using them to create entire fonts they\u2019re limited to expanding a family into
    a much bigger family."

    I draw a bolder weight, black one for instance. After I interpolate those two

    the bold weight. Even with the interpolation method, you still have to make some

    nodes to be sure there are always in the same position. To make a better interpolation
    you have to have the same amount of nodes in each alternate glyph. I've already
    tried to expand individually, but this method seems doesn't fit to me. An other
    way I find pretty good an efficiency is to work with the \u201CInterpolate nodes\u201D
    under the Contour menu. You start from a lighter or bolder weight and move the
    nodes at the distance you want and it keep on background the original as long
    you work on.\r\nHope this will be helpful."

    - that's what interpolation is: taking two points of data and generating a new
    one on the line between them.\r\n\r\nNote that the aforementioned tools in the

  body: Making a thing of value always takes hard work. While there are tools to help
    you find a starting point for between states (interpolation), even these must
    be visually corrected and adjusted to their new role. Drawing the extremes requires
    the most work but does not assure a smooth transition during interpolation. Relax
    and enjoy the drawing part, it is the most rewarding and least time consuming
    phase anyway.

    some difference of opinion on this point. Or maybe I misunderstand you? If you
    mean, the amount of overshoot is likely to be consistent, that may be. But if
    you mean, the x-height, cap height and descender depth are likely to be the same,
    at least some designers disagree. For a heavier weight, one might compensate with
    either a greater x-height (my preferred solution, one I've seen from a number
    of type designers whose work I appreciate), or a smaller cap height (the approach
    preferred by Robert Slimbach, another type designer I respect a great deal). Or
    one could do a smidge of both, I suppose.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
