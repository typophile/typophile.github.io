    match. \r\n\r\nThere are enough subtle differences in repeating letters to lead
    me to believe these are calligraphy, not typefaces."

  body: "I edited to remove the distracting tropical disco effects, enhance clarity
    etc.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bawat@33_6438.jpg]\r\nMakes it easier
    to focus on some substitutes for this lettering.\r\nLeaving aside the curly tails
    on _g_ and _y_ and the explosive dot on _i_, I seem to recall several marker pen
    type fonts that would be passable stand ins.\r\nDon"
