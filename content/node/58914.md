  RHINO FONTS \u2013 New Site \u2013 New Design \u2013 New Typeface\r\n...............................................................................................................................\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nMRF
  have had five happy years since the launch in 2004. Several typefaces have seen
  the daylight and become popular among the design community around the world. MRF
  look forward to continuing this tradition \u2014 for many years to come!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com\r\n...............................................................................................................................\r\n\r\nNEW
  SITE/NEW DESIGN\r\nWe say it's new because the content is mostly different from
  the earlier website. Due to a couple of productive years, several new designs have
  now been featured and displayed properly. Apart from the core type section (which
  have been expanded and optimised) several galleries of type in use have been added.
  One for Retail type in use and another for custom type in use. Last (but not least)
  is a section called The world of type, showing off sad, ugly and just beautiful
  typography surrounding us. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com/retailtypeinuse.html\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com/customtypeinuse.html\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com/worldoftype.html\r\n..............................................................................................................................\r\n\r\nTYPE
  SPECIMEN ETC.\r\nMerchandise is another priority taken care of. MRF know from experience
  that customers like specimens t-shirts and other goods. Now MRF have started up
  sales in a small scale and offers a few goodies to begin with. This section will
  be expanded in the future.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com/merchandise.html\r\n...............................................................................................................................\r\n\r\nNEW
  TYPEFACE\r\nEuroglory \u2013 a smooth sans serif with rounded edges. Straight enough
  to be a corporate workhorse and built as a solid companion for magazine work. Made
  in two steps and part two of this family became available as a retail typeface through
  Veer Inc, earlier this year. See the full story behind it and be sure to download
  the pdf-specimen.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com/euroglory.html\r\n...............................................................................................................................\r\n\r\nFREE
  STUFF\r\nAs before MRF still have a few single weight typefaces to offer for free.
  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com/free.html\r\n...............................................................................................................................\r\n\r\nABOUT
  MRF\r\nThe foundry operates as an independent studio, collaborating with its partners
  in various disciplines whenever necessary. Apart from the retail designs MRF also
  specializes in custom type design. The founder Stefan Hattenbach have been focusing

  body: I know beggars can't be choosers, but the .sit files for the free fonts on
    your MacRhino site aren't opening for me. Even used StuffItExpander and all I
    get are a bunch of files, none of which are TTF OTF or Type1. (I'm not a Mac man,
    and that's likely my problem.)
