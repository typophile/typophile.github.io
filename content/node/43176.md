  to the long 's' (\u017F) or it were just a decorative distinction? Unlike letters
  like '\u0462' or '\u0472' that came to represent the same sounds as '\u0435' and
  '\u0444' in Russian, but were originally distinct, the s's  seem to have derived
  from the same source, and have always sounded exactly alike. I guess, what I am
  trying to discover, is weather there was any rationale behind their use, or was
  it merely a fluke of the evolutionary process.\r\n\r\n<em>Granted, it looks \u017Ftunningly
  impre\u017F\u017Five in Italics!</em>"

  body: "The long s was the default form of the letter, the short s being used only
    at the end of words, or as the second of two s's.\r\nSo the version in need of
    a rationale is the short s; why was an alternate form considered necessary, by
    scribes, for the end of words? Was there an ergonomic dividend, or did it just
    look good?\r\n\r\nIMO it was banished from the type case (in France first) due
    to a congruence of aesthetic and practical factors, the aesthetic being the 18th
    century modern movement, which was reductive (as modernism tends to be), the practical
    being the advatages to be had  simplifying the contents of the type case by removing
    an alternate which was fragile and tricky to fit, necessitating many ligatures.
    There may also have been a connection to the increase in general literacy and
    reading which occurred at that time, so it could be considered \"dumbing down\".\r\n\r\nAn
    interesting parallel today is the replacement of contextual alternates for left
    and right quote marks--\"curly quotes\"-- by the single form of vertical \"hash
    marks\", which would suggest that the process is indeed technologically precipitated,
    but adopted by a new franchise of users for whom the traditional distinction is
    meaningless.\r\n\r\nBTW, a parallel in Greek is the two forms of beta (again,
    with and without descender) used in some orthographies, although the version with
    descender was used only at the beginning of words, in a quasi-titlecase usage.
    At least, that's my understanding, perhaps someone who is more of a Greek scholar
    than I am can confirm this?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/barb_4300.png]"

    similar to what happened with u/v.\r\nInterestingly, I've heard an alternative
    theory, that it was the terminal s that will difficult to set as it tended to
    break, and was thus used sparingly, but your version sounds a lot more convincing.\r\nI
    also vaguely remember something about a short s being used before f and k, and
    double \u017F\u017F being more standard to English then the Germanic \u017Fs or
    \xDF.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal Art and Design
