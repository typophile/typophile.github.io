body: "Hi I'd really like to know what this font is.\r\n\r\nIt's very helvetica-esque
  except that it has smaller 'spurs' (?) on the lower case p and g and n. It's all
  a bit tighter too. It also has quotation marks that end in a point rather than more
  solid like helvetica does.\r\n\r\nI've tried the identifont '20 questions' thing
  and it didn't find anything quite right. Also looked through many many many pages
  of 'similar to Helvetica' with no results.\r\n\r\nIf someone with a magic eye can
  identify it that'd be awesome!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adam_5896.and.joe.go.tokyo.0101.jpg]"

  body: "I think it might actually be <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica/roman/\">Helvetica
    Roman</a> with added stroke to make it look like Bold weight. That would close
    down the openings like this and shorten the stems, like your sample, I think.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the keys here, I think, is that the terminals of the G, C and e are horizontal
    as they are in Helvetica.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Makes me thinking also to [[http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/Fett/|Akkurat
    Fett]] (especially the /a) but the /g is off and Akkurat is probably more condensed
    than your sample...
