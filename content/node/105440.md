  body: Looks custom to me and /s looks even weird among the others. If I have to
    recreate it and even if it sounds "crazy", I'd probably start from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eurostile|Eurostile]]
    (mainly beacause of this /s) redrawing almost all letters from /o. An effortless
    solution would be to start from [[http://fontfabric.com/age-free-font|Age]] and
    borrow /s from Eurostile.
