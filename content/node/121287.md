  NOVEMBER 21, 6 P.M.\r\n\r\nFORM TO THOUGHT - Aesthetics of fonts and paper. A special
  lecture by an Italian letterpress-printer.\r\nIn the digital age, the visual and
  tactile delights experienced by reading books set by hand in type fonts of great
  beauty and printed on hand-made papers, has never been so well celebrated as it
  is in a unique series of four volumes concerning the aesthetics of the book, by
  worldwide-famous Tallone printer, which contain original printed examples from the
  Thirties, and papers samples and watermarks of the last six centuries \u2013 from
  those made at the time of Johannes Gutenberg and Aldus Manutius, to the Batchelor's
  Kelmscott paper created for William Morris, and those skillfully made by the most
  illustious paper makers from the early twentieth century to the present.\r\n\r\nThe
  daunting task of collecting all this material within the covers of the four Manuali
  Tipografici, each printed in some 300 copies, has been possible due to the centuries-old
  history of the Tallone typographic studio, described in the documentary The book
  handicraft (subtitled in English), which will be shown at Casa Italiana together
  with the precious contents of the Manuali, in a unique journey through the aesthetics
  of original type fonts, accumulated over the centuries and still in use, and six
  centuries of papers and fascinating watermarks. More details here."
