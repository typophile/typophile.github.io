    from friends) for next to nothing. \r\n\r\nSi"

    So yes. And that's probably what I'll do.\r\n\r\nMy hesitation comes from:\r\n\r\nA.)

    target=\"_blank\">photograph section</a> with lots of original/one-of-a-kind photos.
    \ I just bought a bunch of photos from the 1800's that I plan to use in some design/art
    work.\r\n\r\nCheck out the comtemporary section, but also the antique one since
    people seem to put photos from the 60's and 70's in this section as well."

    type]] works with similar images for his collages; almost every one has a 50s/60s
    theme to it. presumably as they're not being used in a 'commercial' sense they're
    ok to be used in this way, or perhaps copyright laws are different in brazil?\r\n\r\nappropriate
    (ie the legal issues i guess) use of 'found' images is always confusing."

  body: "I contacted the holder of copyright and got a quick refusal, I'd guess because
    it is simpler to say no. Anyway, yes. I like Eduardo's work and have always come
    back to collage as a form. Here I'm interested in the subtle communication of
    the time we (Pam and I) are from\u2014the convergence of the pre-digital with
    the contemporary. We are both a bit old school maybe.\r\n\r\nSo I'm just going
    to shoot this as I much prefer an SX-70 as a head.\r\n\r\nThanks all. Off to thrift!"
