  is a PDF with five different versions of the first page of my writing sample (for
  tenure track job applications in philosophy). The only difference from page to page
  is the initial capital. Which one do you prefer?  I suspect this issue is just a
  matter of pure preference, and thus that there is no wrong answer here. That said,
  I'd still like to know what more experienced typographers and typesetters think.\r\n\r\nI
  know that the kerning can be tweaked a bit more on many of them, but I would like
  to decide which one I'm going to use before I iron out all of the details. Thoughts?
  Suggestions? Criticisms?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nMatty"

    the overall tone of the page. Number 4 would be okay if you would use a more display-ish
    version of the typeface (a thinner cut \u2014 the serifs are too heavy now and
    the thin/thick contrats too weak). If you could achieve this, that\u2019s the
    way to go, imo.\r\nThe italic/swash versions are too distracting.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert
