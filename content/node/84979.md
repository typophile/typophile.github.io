body: "I am currently considering the idea of cross-branding distribution opportunities
  with several manufacturers with whom I have OEM deals. As envisioned, I would offer
  several thematic packages, as well as my entire collection, as add-ons to their
  product lines.\r\n\r\nThe fonts in the original OEM packages have customized copyright
  agreements, identifying the manufacturers as licensed distributors, and also include
  the manufacturer's logo as a glyph within the fonts included. Ideally, I would like
  to be able to include the same things in the co-branded fonts. And, ideally, I would
  like to automate the procedure, since I'm looking at approximately 600-650 fonts
  in each of several packages.\r\n\r\nI imagine that inserting the glyph isn't a problem,
  if the slot already exists in the source font (no change in the GlyphIndex required),
  but I wonder about two other, slightly more complicated, changes. The first is the
  copyright DATE, which varies according to the creation date of the font; the second
  is the version number, which I would like to uptick one notch in all cases.\r\n\r\nOff-the-shelf
  doable? Custom scripting doable? Just a pipe dream?"

  body: "I once had to customize the font copyright message on around 2 kilofonts.
    I need it done  in two days and I didn't have time to get into scripting. On a
    spare laptop I installed Fontlab and a task automator.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.spacetornado.com/DoItAgain/\r\n\r\nIt
    actually plays Steely Dan \"Do it again\" when you start it up.\r\n\r\nI arranged
    the windows, rehearsed, recorded the sequence, speed it up and let it rip. It's
    inelegant but it got the job done by morning. Which is good because I made a typo
    and had to start all over again.\r\n\r\n . . . and just be careful not to bump
    the mouse.\r\n"

    into a text editor and do a search & replace then copy & paste it back into the
    font.\r\n\r\nThis type of processing takes much longer to run than a script. Maybe
    take in a matinee."

  body: "Thanks for the input, Ray. The Macro solution might solve part of the problem
    for OTF fonts\u2014but possibly not for TTF fonts\u2014generated by FontLab. I
    have noticed FontLab's annoying tendency of unchecking the \"Copy values to TrueType
    metrics\" box under <strong>Most important font dimensions</strong>, thus screwing
    up the TTF metrics (according to FontValidator), and also failing to generate
    the GASP table unless you tab to its page <em>each time</em> you generate a TTF
    font. Different flavor, different macro I suppose..."

  body: I use WinAutomation. http://www.winautomation.com/ It does the job well enough,
    but not as great as a program I used to use (that is no longer available). You
    could even include a conditional routine to check that TTF box.

    to do the job, either on its own or assisted by system software. Ware, FF drops

  body: "In my opinion, ttx is much more likely to leave the font intact than fontforge.
    I'd first try using ttx and an xml parser, to keep things simple (that requires
    a font that is properly restored if you apply ttx once to get the .ttx file, and
    then ttx on the resulting .ttx file). If you simply want to replace strings, it
    is then quite simple. Here is an example (tested with the macport python26 @2.6.7_1+ucs4
    on OS X 10.5 and 10.6). First run <code>ttx -i</code> on <code>filename.ttf</code>
    or <code>filename.otf</code>. Then run <code>python substs.py filename.ttx</code>
    where <code>substs.py</code> is a file containing\r\n<PRE>\r\n# -*- coding: utf-8
    -*-\r\nfrom xml.etree.ElementTree import ElementTree\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\ntree=ElementTree()\r\ntree.parse(sys.argv[1])\r\n\r\np=tree.find(\"name\")\r\nfor
    r in p.findall('namerecord'):\r\n  id=int(r.get('nameID'))\r\n  if   id == 0:\r\n
    \   r.text=\"Copyright \xA9 1642-2011\".decode('utf-8')\r\n  elif id == 5:\r\n
    \   r.text=\"Version 299.z\"\r\ntree.write(\"tmpout.xml\")\r\n</PRE>\r\n(<em>mutatis
    mutandis</em>). You then add to the file <code>tmpout.xml</code> the following
    first line\r\n<code>\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r\n</code>\r\nrename
    the resulting file fontname.ttx and then run ttx on it to get your new font.\r\n\r\nA
    bash script file that applies ttx, then calls the python script, adds the first
    line, and finally applies ttx back again   is less than 20 lines long. \r\n"

  body: "Cool, Michael!\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nNote, that it is not
    necessary to decompile the whole fonts with TTX, but the name table only (and
    the cff table, if present and if you also want to replace the copyright info there).
    The table can be merged into the source fonts with TTX. This is faster and the
    risk to damage anything is lower."

    "<code>ttx -m</code>"  &nbsp; I can process a font that can't be processed otherwise.
    Hmm, I thought I had tried that before without success... Thanks.
