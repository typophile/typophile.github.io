  English-language typeface for gravestone / headstone design.  That posting is here:\r\n\r\n
  \ http://typophile.com/node/119579\r\n\r\nMy difficulty with selection of Hebrew
  typeface is a good deal greater, since the only Hebrew typeface I already own is
  \"Adobe Hebrew\".  So, it's harder for me to easily play around with different typeface
  choices.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or suggestions, please?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    font you choose for the English?\r\n\r\nMy favorite Hebrew type is I can recommend
    \ [[http://goo.gl/mHUa7w|Hadashaa]], but once i'll see the design you did in English
    I'll know better."

  body: Thanks for your response.  Right now, looks like I'm going with Bitstream
    Iowan Old Style BT in its Bold weight.  (If not Iowan, then Adobe Jenson Pro in
    Semi-Bold; regardless, some sturdy humanist serif typeface.)  Again, primary difficulty
    I have with selecting Hebrew typefaces, is simply that I don't have many (besides
    "Adobe Hebrew") to play with...  Appreciate any advice you might have.  Thanks.

  body: In what way do you think this is better than Adobe Hebrew to complement Iowan?  (Other
    than the fact that I assume you have pride in it given that it's your creation...)

  body: "My type is more modern :) You can see the two:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2fonts_5283.png]\r\n\r\nThere
    is also a typeface I designed called \"Shabtai\" [[http://www.samlil.co.il/shabtai/|-
    a blog post about the design process]] - it has more of a biblical feel to it.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Adobe Hebrew - it's not the best type in my opinion. It looks too much like
    Hadasaa, but misses the design subtleties. Letters like 'Alef' and 'Pe' are too
    dark and not carefully designed. "

  body: With respect and appreciation for your work, I think that Adobe Hebrew has
    a sturdier feel that is better aligned with Iowan Old-Style BT Pro Bold...  I'm
    not sure that Adobe Hebrew is the right match overall, but I think it's the closer
    of these particular two.  Thanks anyway.
