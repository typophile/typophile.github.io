body: "I was recently approached by a large online custom imprint firm about licensing
  some of my fonts for their operation. Initially, it appeared that this request would
  be handled as a simple server-based license but, when I received the final draft
  of the proposed licensing agreement, a paragraph on \u201CDistribution\u201D was
  added. Evidently, this operation has plans (how imminent is not clear) to expand
  beyond the virtual world to storefront operations, where customers can prepare artwork
  for imprinting on location, or for taking to outside printers, wherein lies the
  rub.\r\n\r\nAs the Distribution paragraph is now written, customers taking their
  files elsewhere would be supplied with copies of the fonts used in the project,
  which opens a completely different can of worms. If they were supplying their customers
  with print-ready PDFs, or with other type document with the font outlines converted
  to EPS or SVG, I could see this end use as an extension of the server-based licensing;
  however\u2026\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, both server-based and point-of-sale retail
  usage of fonts\u2014essentially one-time outline rentals\u2014would be metered,
  then paid for periodically on a per-use basis. But, until someone comes up with
  a way to do that, I have to decide if I want to sign on to this deal and, if so,
  what to ask as compensation. Any thoughts?\r\n"

    buy the rights to the fonts or commission new designs on a work-for-hire basis.

  body: "Then again\u2026\r\n\r\nNow that I think about it I\u2019m not sure this
    is really such a big deal. Designers who don\u2019t buy printing for clients commonly
    dump all the files in a design, including the fonts, to disc and and it over to
    their client who then passes it along to a printer. And most font EULAs allow
    this sort of thing in their clause allowing fonts to be used by service bureaus.
    This seems to be a similar situation; in this case the clients are probably not
    people who are likely to have a motivation to scoop the fonts off the disc and
    do anything with them. Maybe you should just allow it provided that each font
    comes with a readme file noting that the fonts are only licensed for printing
    that particular design and a new license must be purchased for other uses."

    the client knows that they have \"free\" font files in their job file depends
    on how savvy the client is; the folks at service bureaus and print shops, however,
    are very aware. In an ideal world, every print shop would have an IP Compliance
    Officer, and that would work. However, in the real world, what usually happens
    is this:\r\n\r\n<ol><li>A client's job comes in. The job is inspected, and accompanying
    font files are installed on the server.</li>\r\n<li>The job is proofed, revised
    if necessary, and then goes to film or direct to plate.</li>\r\n<li>After the
    job is delivered, nobody bothers to delete the font files from the server, and
    the print shop design staff suddenly has more fonts at its disposal.</li></ol>\r\n\r\nThe
    worst-case scenario would be a very savvy user who brings his or her own flash
    drive into the POS design station, which he or she claims has project artwork
    on it. Once the flash drive is connected, he or she navigates to the Fonts folder
    and transfers the whole kit and kaboodle to the flash drive...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "To solve this problem, you have to change your way of thinking about traditional
    licensing methods . . .\r\n\r\nThe future of font licensing is cloud based which
    means, the font lives here nor there . . . No longer can we associate licensing
    with a fixed number of desktops or output devices but rather the specific number
    of end users and when the total number of users is no longer an appropriate variable,
    the fallback is uses or more specifically individual uses . . .\r\n\r\nI define
    these as 'impressions' and for the last 4 years have become an advocate for this
    manner of font licensing . . .\r\n\r\nConsider this as 'microstock' licensing
    but for fonts . . . Each time the font is used where it generates value for the
    item being purchased, a small fee is payable to the foundry.\r\n\r\nWhether the
    font resides on a server or the outlines are embedded in a software file that
    is re-distributed, you have to determine what fee gives you the piece of mind
    that you're not losing a sale . . .\r\n\r\nAlso remember all agreements are negotiable
    and you have the option to strike or modify any portion that you find unpalatable
    . . .\r\n\r\nFYI, we have several of these licenses already in place and they
    continue to make income for the foundries we represent at Font Bros . . .\r\n\r\nStuart

  body: I have an OEM agreement with one software firm that pays me royalties on sales
    on a quarterly basis; however, the agreement I'm looking at doesn't provide for
    periodic payments. As it's currently drafted, the licensing fee would be a one-time
    deal, the term would be in perpetuity, and the grant would extend to all media
    currently available or any which might be devised in the future...

  body: "The money would have to be really good for you to accept terms of this nature
    . . .\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking this is too far reaching and could create a situation
    where you'd be competing with yourself in the future if they ever decided to resell
    or give away the fonts in a different format . . .\r\n\r\nMany folks who've been
    around the block on this would simply encourage you to build them a custom one-off
    they can purchase outright since they could lord over the details of what they
    wanted to do with it and you'd have your cash and clean hands of the deal . .
    .\r\n\r\nUltimately you have to decide from a business perspective if its a fair
    deal for all parties but know it could certainly hamper your ability to negotiate
    future licenses of the same scale if this group comes back for another sweetheart
    deal for them of a company they own/run . . .\r\n\r\nStuart :D"
