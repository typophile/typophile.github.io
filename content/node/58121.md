  body: "It is amazing what 30 years and some PR will do. \r\n\r\nI find this genre
    dated, industrial looking and clunky. They are going to have to edit the copy
    to accommodate a long headline as Archer is not space conservative. Is not that
    the typeface tail wagging the editorial dog.\r\n\r\nAh, for the days when I did
    not even use Lubalin Graph but sporadically.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "I would be more impressed if Newsweek would just go back to being a credible
    news publication. I stopped reading Newsweek because the writing went downhill
    and they targeted the USA with a dumbed-down version targeted at Bush voters,
    complete with different covers that avoided contradicting Republican doctrine.
    No redesign is going to make up for that. Give me an intelligent editorial policy
    and design by Spiekermann\u2014The Economist shows us why a real news magazine
    doesn\u2019t need gimmicky graphics to sell."

    newsstand.

  body: I only just noticed the redesign (I NEVER read Newsweek) and thought Archer
    was a surprising choice too. I love Archer but it ain't gonna get me to buy Newsweek,
    that's for sure. I have an inexplicable free subscription to Martha so I get my
    Archer fix there.
