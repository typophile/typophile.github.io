body: "The magazine I work at uses Amplitude for body text in sidebars and I don't
  want to set fake italics. Is there a version of Amplitude Italic anywhere  or possibly
  a suitable italic weight of another font that can be substituted in it's place?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: They exist, but I'm not sure if they're ready for retail. Contact [[Font Bureau]]
    or [[Christian Schwartz]] and they may get you a pre-release version.
