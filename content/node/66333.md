  trying to get a good grasp of the differences of some different styles of type.
  Are Adobe's specimens of Jensen and Garamond (Adobe Jensen Pro and Garamond Pro)
  faithful to their namesakes, enough that I would not be bereft if I were to study
  them? \r\n\r\nCan someone recommend some typefaces to me that would be worthwhile
  to dissect and really study the letterforms?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nBrendan"
