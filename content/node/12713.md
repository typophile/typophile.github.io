  body: 'cyndy, how are you going to use the typefaces? If its one word for the script,
    I''d fire up Corel Painter and use one of the suggested scripts as a template
    and paint the letters using either an oils brush or an impasso brush. Just a thought '

  body: "Cyndy,\r\n\r\nThis might be a good opportunity to sell some hand lettering
    to your client. The sample you show is hand lettering, and it's old, too. There
    are some brush lettering artists who might do something similar or even mimic
    the style faithfully, but you will not get the same wiggly feeling from type.
    Look up Jill Bell, John Downer, Michael Clark, Carl Rohrs, and other brush letterers.
    Support lettering artists! There are effects you can't get with type. \r\n\r\nCarl"
