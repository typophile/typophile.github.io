<p>Hi, TPh&rsquo;s! This is a glyph I&rsquo;ve been working for a while and need some help in deciding which trend to follow, if there&rsquo;s one:
&mdash;excuse me by relating the image&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>#1 is the most 'normal', being the loop dominates the width</li>
<li>#2 is a variation I like: the link is wider than the loop (which is narrower) by its left side</li>
<li>#3 is similar to #1, except for the inflection in the link</li>
<li>#4 –quirky– is similar to #2 (narrower loop), but the sharp link</li>
</ul>
Forgive the noticeable imbalances: it is the shape as a whole what I'm trying to choose among these.
I guess the upper counter and the ear work fine for a text font, even though I need to refine the contrasts and the overweight in junctions, but there'll be time to.
[[http://typophile.com/files/my_g.pdf|Here I post a PDF]] for better inspection.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As you say, 1 and 3 are good, normal forms. I like 2 as well, but wonder how it will fit with the rest of the glyphs. I also wonder if you could lengthen the descender a bit as well, at least for display settings. 1 &amp; 2 together might give some interest for words with two gg&rsquo;s (eggs, for example).</p>
<p>4 is odd, but not unserviceable. What would it look like if the like joined the bowl a tad bit higher? (The angle of the straight edge of the sharp link catches my eye.) Or perhaps drop the right part of the loop a bit to balance.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very nice idea to create the gg glyph from the 1/2 variations.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ah, the hardest [Latin] glyph!</p>
<p>The thing about the &ldquo;g&rdquo; is, I feel there&rsquo;s a large gulf between what the reader needs and what other type designers expect. There are very few binocular &ldquo;g&quot;s that I personally like, and there&rsquo;s a lot of room for improvement on the conventional forms.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The closed bottom makes the form too complex - almost Chinese. It does not belong in the Latin alphabet (even though we&rsquo;re consciously used it to by now). I&rsquo;m a big fan of the open bottom - although it&rsquo;s much harder to pull off. Even Baskerville&rsquo;s is non-ideal - too apologetic.</li>
<li>The thick top of the bottom bowl should not be very horizontal, and -assuming your font has stroke contrast- should get thicker on the right. To me the conventional flat, evenly-thick stroke is a disaster*. HOWEVER, you probably cannot make the bottom of &ldquo;g&rdquo; entirely like [most of] the rest of the alphabet; it&rsquo;s better to emulate the &ldquo;s&rdquo;. Thanks in part to Roy Preston&rsquo;s designer&rsquo;s intuition many years ago, I personally arrived at this:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unless maybe you have a &ldquo;z&rdquo; with thick horizontals.</li>

I&rsquo;m working hard in that open loop you like. Initially I was not much enthusiastic, but I need to tell that Hrant triggered my never-answered ancient doubts (concerns) about the causes of current <em>&ldquo;too complex - almost Chinese&rdquo;</em> shape of lc closed loop g.
I can easily assume the transition from the UC to the open lc –it is very appropriate considering lc were tied to manuscript writing–, but when I had to face production, and the original design was a &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; closed loop g, I felt a big confusion: the unnatural changes in the thicknes of strokes, and even the disruption between the top and the bottom ones, made me think there was some kind of undecipherable secret formula. I don&rsquo;t know why I gave in and went along with the crowd.
Finally, I believe my g will be open tail.</p>
<p><strong>Craig, Merkri and Steve:</strong>
Here it goes a &ldquo;flogger&rdquo; (by the moment I cannot write <em>hamburgefons</em> and anyway it doesn&rsquo;t match my purposes) new sample of the quasi-ligature g_g, where one can realize that the first uneven solution is much better than the second (duplicated g) one. I guess it will be a good –and funny– step for futher investigation.

But perhaps you can change his/their mind with a result they can&rsquo;t help but like!  :-)</p>
<p>In your post of 4:15am, the first &ldquo;g&rdquo; still needs polish of course, but it could work depending on other glyphs in the font, especially the &ldquo;a&rdquo;: will it have a tapering top or a serifed one? What about the &ldquo;s&rdquo;? I&rsquo;m guessing that will have serifs on both ends.</p>

<p>My experience with opening the tail on a g usually ended with narrowing the lower bowl a bit and/or slightly expanding the upper bowl (less often). Otherwise, the g can look like it&rsquo;s unraveling at large size and under 12 point can look too light.</p>

I guess the way is probably the second one, with minor adjustments, which matches the font <em>ductus</em>:

<img src="/images/old-images/Picture_1_4789.png" alt="">
The ear is now bolder and points up.
There are subtle optical corrections in the outline of the bowl.
Even when the link is shorter, it keeps the original starting angle.
The tail has been softened and its spine leans to the right enough to avoid the previous left tilting of the figure.
The serif is larger (the same size of the s&rsquo;s one), but doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice the air needed to make the loop looks open at small sizes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Picture_2_6037.png" alt="">
I like the way it works between the nn (the ear plays well with the top serif at the stem of the n) and oo, though I wonder if the bowl is light a bit in comparison –may be my idea–.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Picture_3_3782.png" alt="">
In context, it seems to me elegant and very readable.</p>

<li>I'm not sure about what criteria one must follow to build such a comprehensive database:<ol>
<li>Processing all words of a given language (let's say, at least 30 K to 60 K words), though... what about punctuation and other characters?</li>
<li>Processing large amounts of relevant text written in a given language (countless books) as is, though... what is relevant at all?</li>
<li>Processing thes large amounts of relevant text written in a given language, and its capitalized version.</li>

</li>
<li>Solved the first question, how many pairs one must consider relevant for kerning? (I assume over 600 pairs become unmanageable for both, the designer and the font spacing processor).</li>

<p>[[http://www.bycsrl.com.ar/gallery/lfm.php|My modest unfinished engine]] is just a try in the sense of finding frequent occurrences of letter pairs (&ldquo;no&rdquo;) and neighbors (&ldquo;non&rdquo;) by mining in the web.</p>
<p>When finished, it will automatically search among pages written in a given language, and then will process them in order to create an evolving (evolutive?) database of recurring associated letters, so as, for the end user, the interface will only show a sortable list of instances to research on, something like it displays once you process the entered text in the alpha version.</p>

Neither am I! 
I believe this is an issue best tackled by scientists and serious researchers (and must have been). There&rsquo;s a load of knowledge and brain power behind making a serious selection, and I believe that shouldn&rsquo;t be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Your engine looks interesting – what did you program it in, is that just PHP string analysis?
So it&rsquo;s going to crawl web pages? Cool approach. That may be highly interesting for developing screen fonts at the very least. (It would be interesting to have a comparison of words / letter combinations used in web sites and in print – I wonder how much of a difference there is.)</p>

<p>Nice-clever consideration.</p>
<p>Intuitively, I tend to believe that web crawling will return much more typical pattern redundance than analyzing printed text, being the (conscious/un conscious) concision of online writing. I guess it will bring a lot of punctuation marks, as well.</p>

<p>Actually that&rsquo;s a pretty modest number these days, not even counting class kerning! Even just for basic Latin support I tend to go around 1500 &ldquo;manual&rdquo; pairs (and not because I&rsquo;m unhappy with my &ldquo;base spacing&rdquo;). BTW, some years ago certain apps had a problem with over ~2000 pairs, but that seems to have died off.</p>

I suspect that it&rsquo;s relative to a degree. If the font will be used online, then online language usage would be &ldquo;typical&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a font for the next luxury edition of the Bible, maybe not. (Not that I&rsquo;m implying it is!) :-)
But the influence of context/media on actual letter combinations may well be so minute that it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, at least not for locating kerning pairs. Dunno.</div>

<p><em>&ldquo;If the font will be used online, then online language usage would be “typical”.&quot;</em></p>
<p>I was speaking about &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; flat web crawling, neither font nor content oriented (you know, <em>&ldquo;for a semantic web&rdquo;</em>). My unspecific induction is that because of the relative degree of standardization in language  used in web pages, and the over redundancy of certain formula (let&rsquo;s say, : &ldquo;home&rdquo;, &ldquo;Google&rdquo;, &ldquo;search&rdquo;), if not filtered, may drive to quirky results.</p>
<p>About the Bible (which version?), there are numerous comprehensive term searching by there: surprisingly, some words one could suppose usual in it, are not.</p>

Slimbach? Hmmm&hellip; It&rsquo;s hard for me to find similarities.
Mi first post was only an attempt to catch some attention on the quirky loop, where I had a couple of uncertainties. The broken link appears in many faces. Hoever, it was not my aim to post an original new shape, but to trigger unconscious of forgotten questions, both in me and in the critics.
After all, I think I succedd in that matter.
I&rsquo;ll make some tries on a quasi vertical serif in the tail (actually, in my post of the 19.Feb.2009 6.20am you can look at a previous one).
Thanks for your ideas.</p>

The next step is softening the strong hardness of the strokes, though without losing the sharp look I want to preserve in the font.

<p>On the caps, I suspect a challenge with such bold serifs will be to get them to work on the thin strokes without overwhelming them. AKMNUVWXY (Actually, the diagonal thins make it easier, as they flow into one side of the serif, so the real challenges are MNU.) Maybe cupping the serifs more will help here and will also &ldquo;soften the strong hardness of the strokes,&rdquo; though perhaps that would lose too much of the sharpness you want to retain.</p>

I must confess that when I encouraged you to pick the y I liked more, I was secretly validating my concerns on the bottom of mine. Anyway, I guess both are very personal and have their own character for not being related, except as &ldquo;cousins in law&rdquo; ;-)
Your &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; y leans on a slanted serif while my &ldquo;republican&rdquo; one is abosultely conservative and sets its whole foot on the floor.
Probably the L is more wide than light. The leg of the K needs to be more N, R alike.</p>
<p><strong>Craig:</strong>
I was going and coming around the cupping: actually, my first try was a deep cupping that seemed to my eyes very distractive. I think that because of hinting (or unhinting) the current one does not look as curvy as in hardcopies (it will be a defiying matter for the display version).
<img src="/images/old-images/MNU_5786.png" alt="">
It&rsquo;s a quiz in which I&rsquo;ll have a hard battle until arriving at the fair point.</p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong>
About the Q, I was kidding for a while, making time to decide if I melt the tail in the bowl or split the stroke away.
My M will be definitely legs-splayed, a decission I was lazily avoiding to make.</p>
<p><strong>Hrant:</strong>
My J rised its bottom until reaching the baseline.
<img src="/images/old-images/MOJO_6683.png" alt="">
I&rsquo;m not sure about the width of the entire UC, since they are in an very early approach.</p>

<p>Q: I&rsquo;d certainly encourage you to make it as little like an &ldquo;O&rdquo; as possible.

Or not. :-)  The first one can work, but that gap is too tentative - you might try curling the right stroke inward. The second is of course safest, but maybe too safe - a lost opportunity; but if you go with it you might try pointing the terminal upward, moving the cupping to the right side? If that works, you might try that on the first one too.</p>
<p>As you might suspect my favorite is the third - but it needs work: the lefthand join is too abrupt, and the tail needs weight and definitely stroke contrast, most likely in the form of making it increasingly thick (and then tapering quickly).</p>

<p><strong>Jelmar</strong>, actually, the counter in curvy shapes is intentionally rotated 3 degrees to the left, to keep some calligraphic taste and to avoid &ldquo;hyperelliptization&rdquo;.
Though it&rsquo;s more noticeable in the O and Q, you can find the axis is also slanted in the C, D, G, b, c, d, e, g, o, p, q, for example.
Usually Humanist ([[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/adobe_jenson_pro_ot_virtual/|Jenson Pro]] by Adobe) and Garalde ([[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/caslon_titling_regular/|Caslon Titling]] by Monotype) faces share this feature; I somehow prefer the criterion adopted in Jenson, while Caslon has the counters rotated inversely, that is, 3° to the right.</p>

<p>Well, as said, it is not only common in Garalde letterforms, but also in modern serif fonts (i.e.: [[http://www.typotheque.com/site/font_tester.php?family_id_0=23&amp;id_0=249&amp;size_0=72|Greta]] or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/reminga/|Reminga]]), especially for text (printing) sizes –6 to 12 points– at regular weights, being it won&rsquo;t work well in screens because of aliasing (hinting for display is quite harder). The aim is to resemble some calligraphic gestures –by the other side, usual in wood or metal types– to escape from visual monotony and annoying grays in large blocks of text, beyond keeping alive the soul of writing in production.
Naturally, the O and the Q, being both are almost absolute shapes in terms of symmetry, make it more apparent. When working in context, and if well spaced, letters become sinergically balanced and rhythmic.</p>

2 - consider ways of closing up the top counter or opening up the bottom one. Something about the relative weights of the top (near the serif) and the diagonal seems a little off, too - could you establish the weight you need with just the serif and let the stroke thin a little more?
3 - at the top, see 2
4 - some nice little details here!
5 - curved stroke gets too fat at the top, or gets fat too fast. (compare thickness to the six right next door)
6 - seems to me too sudden of a break between a gentler full-height curve on the left (like parenthesis) and the quicker x-height curve on the right (like &lsquo;o&rsquo;). as a result there&rsquo;s an awkward bend at the lower left 
7 - falling right but that may be okay
8 - curves are nicely drawn
9 - see 6</p>
<p>You may want to make the counters of your 5 more even (lower the middle part) and/or make the counters of your 8 less even (raise the middle part).</p>

The second one is the open version; I&rsquo;ve slightly emboldened the diagonal to catch some weight (the orthogonal cut helps in making it to appear heavier); the solution for the top of the stem –thanks guys– seems to me very pleasant.
In both cases, perhaps the horizontal bar looks a bit high because the lack of serifs, but may be it&rsquo;s me; along the numeral series it seems to work well as is:</p>

<p>Newspapers often use zero leading, so you should avoid leaving one extender (especially such a wide one) hanging lower than the rest. But I just measured it and it&rsquo;s not as low as it appears* - it&rsquo;s <em>almost</em> there with the rest. If you decide to shorten it I would make the diagonal less steep, the lower bowl flatter, and the tail serif shorter. If you do all three each will only have to change a smidgen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it&rsquo;s so wide.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where my favorite paradox kicks in: in a text font, especially one for very small sizes, the &ldquo;g&rdquo; <em>must</em> feel a little cramped, otherwise the balance of compromises isn&rsquo;t ideal. Ugliness isn&rsquo;t something to shun, it&rsquo;s something to assimilate.</p>

I was thinking of a lot on this matter –my concerns were strong, for sure– and made some tries:
<img src="/images/old-images/small_6583.png" alt="">
Even when hinting is not well refined by now, at smaller sizes the terminal of the loops seems to disappear in favor of the opening.
Nevertheless, I have an alternate &ldquo;g&rdquo; (the last one at the right), that still looks nice, I guess:
<img src="/images/old-images/alt_g_6166.png" alt="">
The other solution is a shortened-flattened loop like this (15 units shorter):
<img src="/images/old-images/doubleg_3720.png" alt="">
Actually, I have dozens of alternate g to chose from ;-)</p>

Ben: I prefer to keep a narrow &ldquo;y&rdquo; –I mean, it&rsquo;s intentional– as in my previous &ldquo;yum!&rdquo; sample.
About the j, here&rsquo;s the pair:

Not bad. Though I&rsquo;ve got the tempation of making the joins of the bowls with the stems thinner a bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the new &ldquo;g&rdquo; works with other descending sisters, say, the new &ldquo;y&rdquo;. Still you think my &ldquo;y&rdquo; is narrow, Ben?
<img src="/images/old-images/bezier_4679.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I have a concern about my &ldquo;a&rdquo;. Ain&rsquo;t it quirky? I&rsquo;m not convinced about it. Perhaps the bowl needs to be less vertically slanted.
The &ldquo;j&rdquo; is fine as is, I guess.
I like the unstable balance of the &ldquo;z&rdquo;.

I find y a bit narrow, yes, but if that&rsquo;s what you like then stick with it.
Did I already say how much I like your s?
I&rsquo;m not sure which way you&rsquo;re thinking to slant the a&rsquo;s bowl so will wait to see what you come up with.
z is a good, strong shape but not too pointy. The bowed thins really work well.</div>

<p>Good on ya mate.</p>

But just because you disagree with somebody doesn&rsquo;t mean that person is just <em>pretending</em> to have an educated opinion. Patria is a font of mine that I sell on occasion, case by case. It has won a couple of awards (if that matters). However -mostly due to a distrust of the retail market- most of the type design work I do is commissioned (and mostly in the non-Latin field) so you don&rsquo;t see it floating around too much.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for encouraging me, &ldquo;muzzer&rdquo; (or whatever is your name, fake pictured buddy).
I cannot realize Ben is not green&hellip; Isn&rsquo;t he???
Why do we talk all that puta mierda instead of type design?
Ain&rsquo;t it a Critique/Serif forum?
Fortunately, fuzziness (oh, and humility) is what makes us capable of being designers.
In my modest language, opinion and disdain use not to  be the same thing.
At the risk of being an absolute idiot (&ldquo;you may say I&rsquo;m a dreamer&rdquo;), I tend to trust a polite well founded critic instead of a gut guided prophet (did you try Zoloft?).
Design can be good or bad, precise or vague, efficient or not, but &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; seems not to be a disciplinar category.
I won&rsquo;t go further on that matter.
Just hope garbage don&rsquo;t tarnish that nice space where one can learn a lot if is humble enough and prone to (BTW, I came here for that).
Probably a good sample –and not the only one, for sure– of helpful critic behavior is the first comment on that thread (Steve, 18.Feb.2009 7.01am): clear, fair and concise, though not condescending.
Halt. I&rsquo;m tired. Time is gold. Don&rsquo;t wanna apologize for anything, please.
Like or dislike, that&rsquo;s what I think.</p>

I&rsquo;m not trying to be obnoxious (or wise). I&rsquo;ve just found that comparing detail variants in actual text settings at least for me tends to yield slightly different results from what I&rsquo;d think would look good when examining the glyphs up close. YMMV though, of course, and all that.</p>
<p>Muzzer, why don&rsquo;t you join the discussion in a constructive way? I&rsquo;d be curious why you&rsquo;re so upset about that &ldquo;g&rdquo;. And if you don&rsquo;t like the feed-back we&rsquo;ve been giving to Marcelo, the best way to help him would be to try and do better. :-)</p>

Wow! After all, we are talking about communication, ain&rsquo;t it? How, matters. Manners, matter.
I won&rsquo;t be hurted but that kind of loud-voiced apes, nevermind. I think all those who made comments in this thread disagree with me and my designs in several ways. BTW, nobody agreed my very first work, and most of my tries were objected. I accepted critique in order to improve.
It&rsquo;s only that overacting, overexclaiming, overarguing, bothers me, annoys me, makes me feel sick. When the sole argument, the only word you have to criticize is &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;, God, it&rsquo;s you who&rsquo;s in trouble.
Sorry, I don&rsquo;t wanna lose more time struggling against arrogant people. May be that&rsquo;s the Australian way (I mean, &ldquo;some&rdquo; Australian, it&rsquo;s not the first time I hear them). Go on. Shout and cry. But, please, not in my ear.</p>

<p>Wow, you make this place sound like Flickr - but it isn&rsquo;t, is it? I hope not. And actually, I for one am not known for being nice (at least not online). But I do try to back up my criticism with more than just raw emotion.</p>

FWIW, I value the critique boards because discussion tends to be about type. 
Not about making people feel all warm and fuzzy inside; but also, not about 
attacking them.</div>

<p>I think I was the only one that agreed till now, so you can just say so. ;)</p>
<p>As to why, I have not followed this thread that intensively. I already had my doubts about the open g, but had not posted it. When everybody pretty much burned Muzzer at the stake, like so often happens on Typophile if someone is even slightly harsh in their language (even if the critique isn&rsquo;t directed at them), I decided to post my opinion about the g too. I think the g doesn&rsquo;t look right.</p>
<p>And Nina, using strong language isn&rsquo;t attacking somebody, eventhough strong critique might feel like it. Muzzer <em>was</em> slightly harsh in his wording, but I do not think it was an attack.</p>

<p>?
Maybe things have been softer lately, but I&rsquo;ve been a member since the beginning and I can assure you that is not accurate in toto. I happen to know not least because I&rsquo;ve done a very big chunk of the attacking myself. I&rsquo;ve even attacked entire design schools, accusing them of superficiality. In fact I did so once pretty recently. But I don&rsquo;t expect others to behave like me.</p>
<p>I must say however that people&rsquo;s familiarity with much of my stance in type design (thanks to mondo keystrokes on my part) allows me to conduct fewer repetitive attacks these days. For example I&rsquo;m not really a big fan of this font of Marcelo&rsquo;s (it&rsquo;s too chirographic) but I think that other people will like it a lot, and I just want to help him arrive at a good terminus. There is no perfect font anyway - if I can help him make the &ldquo;g&rdquo; better for example, I feel good. And I think that is one reflection of Design versus Art. Here&rsquo;s another example of what I mean: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/54841">http://typophile.com/node/54841</a>  Note Ben&rsquo;s reaction to my first post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not think it was an attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about anybody else, but saying that I don&rsquo;t make fonts was (and was in no way constructive - it was just defamation). However you will note that I did not strike back, I only defended myself. Not because I don&rsquo;t believe in fights, but because I need a much better reason to muster that energy. Sorry Muzz.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, are there other creative fora where people are regularly harsh, while still providing useful feedback (as opposed to simply venting)?</p>

I was wondering about the overall effect, more so than wanting to criticize you in particular. When I posted the above comment, disliking the &ldquo;g&rdquo; seemed like a growing sentiment, with Höfe kind of chiming in too. I think the pattern, while human, isn&rsquo;t helping.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d still not agree Typophile is too cuddly but I guess we want different degrees, or definitions, of cuddliness. 
In my eyes, when somebody comes barging in, ripping the previous process to shreds, calling the people he doesn&rsquo;t agree with &ldquo;people who don&rsquo;t design fonts&rdquo; (when with a minimal knowledge of Typophile, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that Hrant does design fonts) and at the same time, not trying to be clear and helpful to Marcelo&rsquo;s design process (which I think this thread should be about), then call me too cuddly if you will (and maybe I&rsquo;m being a girl), but I think that is unfair.</p>

<p>Out of thread: I personally get upset a lot when, in written language –regard of the words– people tends to overmark (say, by unnecessarily uppercasing, repeating signs, quoting each single term, and so on). Eloquence –and character too– does not rely on how loud your voice is, or how emotionally populated your text is, but on the clean, economical, precise and moderate use of words.</p>

Notice: I have now three different overshoot zones in uppercases, that is: one for the &ldquo;OQU&rdquo; trio, another for the &ldquo;CGS&rdquo;, and a third for &ldquo;BDPR&rdquo;.</p>
<p>About the &ldquo;a&rdquo;, perhaps it&rsquo;s getting a better equilibrium, thouhg I still haven&rsquo;t found the shape I&rsquo;m looking for.

<p>Typophile isn&rsquo;t cuddly, and I don&rsquo;t think it should be. Whenever someone uses harsh language or &lsquo;attacks&rsquo; you, you should just ignore it or just &lsquo;distill&rsquo; the message and discart the language.</p>

Hrant, would you mind expanding on this?

<p>Jelmar, just to clarify: I didn&rsquo;t mean that disagreeing, per se, isn&rsquo;t helping; of course it is (or can be). I would&rsquo;ve just thought it&rsquo;d be nicer if people who disagree don&rsquo;t only step up in the shadow of somebody big and loud shouting out that it&rsquo;s crap.

That&rsquo;s clear. So&rsquo;s the case of the closed &ldquo;g&rdquo; (I was arguing this point myself earlier today). But I&rsquo;d be curious about <em>why</em> you say the classical closed-top form is &ldquo;unintelligent&rdquo;? I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d have a reason to change it besides the old form, well, being old, and established.</div>

Indeed what you said on the &ldquo;g&rdquo; does not need clarification (at least not right now, though of course everything is always intensifiable, and you know I&rsquo;m always wanting food for thought); but in this case I was wondering about the ampersand, whose closed structure I believe you referred to as an &ldquo;unintelligent anachronism&rdquo;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The ampersand&rsquo;s case is pretty close to that of the &ldquo;g&rdquo; actually. Having the top closed, and then making the &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; continue into the bottom is just noise; it makes the glyph alien (without the benefit of pulling it away from anything else). That structure comes from ease of writing, which is pointless in type. Having a beak on top is more salient, and allows the top counter to participate more. In fact, I have previously tried getting rid of the arm coming up from the bottom as well! There is one font that does this*, and quite well, but I haven&rsquo;t managed to do it properly myself yet.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/script-mt/">http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/script-mt/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All that said, this does not mean that every font must have an open-top ampersand - because functionality is only one factor (although perhaps the primary one, in my book). Patria for example has features that intentionally lower its readability, but contribute to its atmosphere.</p>

I thought of it. I was avoiding that unconsciously, perhpas afraid of matching the ordinary horizontal stroke. As you say, it looks (and behaves) droppy.
I have a previous unpublished alternative, here on the right side:

I realize the gap is narrow (<em>Muzz you&rsquo;ll adore it, mate!!! Ain&rsquo;t it????? Ah???</em>), but think it may work anyway, since it&rsquo;s not smaller than those in the &ldquo;BPR&rdquo;. The old new &ldquo;g&rdquo; seems to be sharper, as well. I&rsquo;ll post a PDF for inspecting.

<p>Alien? To what? To the structure of the Latin alphabet? 
I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re not using the word as opposed to familiarity. I&rsquo;m not subscribing to Emigre&rsquo;s maxim either (you know I like Patria). But while the closed loop is indeed not &ldquo;pulling [the ampersand] away from anything else&rdquo;, does it not matter at all that it&rsquo;s probably closest (I&rsquo;m surmising), for the reader, to some abstract notion of &ldquo;what an ampersand looks like&rdquo; – and I&rsquo;d think, a bit more crucially so than the issue of the &ldquo;g&rdquo;&rsquo;s tail being closed or not?* So this open ampersand needs to overcome a (small) initial threshold of &ldquo;newness&rdquo; for the reader, no?</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree that the design of type should be largely independent from ideas (ideals) of strokes and writing. But I&rsquo;m not quite convinced that people (as in, normal end-users/readers) don&rsquo;t think of lettershapes, even when they&rsquo;re printed, in terms of &ldquo;how they&rsquo;d write it&rdquo; – which would make a difference as to how they will perceive a non-chirographic shape. And in the open ampersand, you actually break the stroke (&ldquo;the thing they may think of as a stroke&rdquo;) in half. Whereas in the &ldquo;g&rdquo; you basically only change the ending, which is less brutal to a chirographic &ldquo;reading&rdquo; of type, and therefore maybe less noticeable?</li>
</ul>
<p>Though of course the ampersand is probably the prime example of a glyph that&rsquo;s open to interpretation. And I&rsquo;m not arguing against this open form, for the record. I see your points, and I actually quite like the shape. I&rsquo;m just trying to see the pros and cons (in terms of functionality; of course there&rsquo;s always aesthetic considerations). 
FWIW, that ampersand from Script MT does seem to get pretty close to the limits of being identifiable as what it is, at least for me.</p>

I agree with Nina. It&rsquo;s quite more similar to an Aleph than to an Ampersand (originally a ligature for the latin term &ldquo;et&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;and&rdquo; in English, &ldquo;y&rdquo; in Spanish, or more closely &ldquo;et&rdquo; in French or &ldquo;e&rdquo; in Portuguese, though time and usage had made their work&hellip;) :-|</p>

Yeap, but the upper comes from an inflection, while the lower does not get into one.
Probably it&rsquo;s yet unbalanced, being it&rsquo;s just born. I&rsquo;ll work on joins closer.
In the meanwhile, I just can offer that:

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I think two things tugging at a glyph are: belonging in a visual dictionary; and being decipherable. And while the former seems pretty literal/formal, the latter is pretty nebulous (meaning that deciphering a glyph involves recognizing enough hazy bits). So maybe something like that ampersand structure that I favor &ldquo;belongs&rdquo; very well while still exhibiting all the necessary hazy bits. But honestly I&rsquo;m not pretending this is a highly robust argument with solid evidence; my stance derives in a large part from instinct: the closed binocular &ldquo;g&rdquo; and the old-fashioned ampersand simply seem pointlessly complex, alien.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not quite convinced that people (as in, normal end-users/readers)

</blockquote>
<p>I honestly have to think that during immersive reading there&rsquo;s absolutely no room for a reader to consider the ease of writing of individual glyphs. Our reading system cannot be bothered by such irrelevances - it is like a hungry wild animal.</p>
<p>And really, who ever writes like any font anyway! We don&rsquo;t reproduce serifs, stroke contrast, etc. Could we really be extracting and evaluating numerous &ldquo;skeletons&rdquo; in a fraction of a second at 10 point? Nevermind that 2/3-rds of the field of vision is in the blurry parafovea.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant :-) Thanks! That was a highly interesting elaboration.</p>
<p>I was probably stuck in the skeleton model to some degree as far as character recognition goes (that &ldquo;abstract notion&rdquo; of what a given character &ldquo;looks like&rdquo;). But you make some excellent points! The model of a &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; of somewhat fuzzy shapes that a (more often than not, also &ldquo;blurry&rdquo;) glyph is matched up against, does seem a lot more plausible than anything involving abstract skeletons.</p>
<p>But, what is in the dictionary? Isn&rsquo;t that where the factor of familiarity comes in? 
I realize this might be splitting hairs, but with not a huge lot of open-topped ampersands around, I&rsquo;d assume the reader might still have a tiny little threshold initially to &ldquo;amend the dictionary&rdquo;, so to speak? (Though the ampersand is probably a bad example, since that particular dictionary entry is atypically broad and fuzzy anyway.)</p>
<p>Hope Marcelo doesn&rsquo;t mind this lil' tangent.</p>

<p>That would be more daring, certainly. As angled now (and especially as tightened closer with the most recent edits), that serif approximates an unseriffed, barely-open loop (like Baskerville&rsquo;s &lsquo;g&rsquo;), which &ldquo;normalizes&rdquo; the open structure. An &rsquo;s'-like serif will be truer to the rest of the font but I suspect might make the &lsquo;g&rsquo; stand out too much. But I think it&rsquo;s worth a try.</p>

<p>The way I use &ldquo;familiarity&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mesh that way with the

<hr>
<p>Marcelo, for what it&rsquo;s worth, the sample looks good to me. Personally, I might make the tail a tiny bit more open (possibly just shortening the serif by a hair) – but, apart from the fact that you know I&rsquo;m not exactly a pro in this, I think the important thing is: Does it look/feel right to <em>you?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not meaning to be unhelpful by any measure. But I&rsquo;d humbly suggest this: Once you feel it is good to your eyes, and right for the font (and this might still take you a little bit of time to find out), I think you shouldn&rsquo;t obsess over getting everyone here to agree on the placement of every node. If you do, I suspect this might merrily go on until 2012 or so. ;-)
I know it can be hard. FWIW, I&rsquo;m currently at this point with my &ldquo;g&rdquo;: I was told it doesn&rsquo;t work. But I know the basic shape is right for me; so I won&rsquo;t question it right now. That helps. BTW, I think it also helps to know/argue why.</p>

Actually, they don&rsquo;t appear in the server anymore.
Say, <a href="http://typophile.com/cms/files/quirky_6534.png">http://typophile.com/cms/files/quirky_6534.png</a> (the picture I needed to replace), produces a 404 server error: &ldquo;The content you are looking for is likely here, but no longer at the URL you specified&rdquo;.

Should you spread the bottom of W wider? I&rsquo;d look at that (maybe particularly moving that right lower vertex rightward). It will look more balanced and will probably fit better with the next letter, too.</div>
