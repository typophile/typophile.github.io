  such are \"officially\" called, for example: http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/5485/textrol.jpg\r\n\r\nSecond
  part of my question is, do you know of any site that provides good, untoched templates
  for this? I found a font that contains these textrolls, but they wasn't what I was
  looking for really.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    - stock xchng is a great place to get these sorts of things, free. the sign up
    is easy and they don't bug you with spam or useless marketing junk. good stuff
    in there for lots of projects.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of unbridled creativity,\r\n\r\nTroy
