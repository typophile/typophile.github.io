body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI just completed a large document (288 pgs) in In-Design
  6 and tried to publish it to PDF.  I know you heard this before.  Adobe refused
  to embed the font, which of course is mandatory.  The font is a TTF created in 2001.\r\n\r\nI
  have written permission to use the font commercially and need to find a way to legally
  remove the do-not-embed restriction.  I contacted the creator of the font, and he
  did not realize he even put in the restriction and does not know how to remove it.
  \ He does not even have the program he used to create the font.  Yikes!\r\n\r\nChanging
  the font would take weeks even though I only use it in chapter heads and drop caps.
  \ I am also afraid outlining would put things out of whack.  It needs to work in
  print and in multiple electronic forms.\r\n\r\nI have scoured the web and have tried
  all sorts of apps.  Some did not work, and I could not even figure out how to use
  a few others.  \r\n\r\nAny ideas on how I can get myself out of this fix?  I get
  addicted to fonts and will resist changing it since it so perfectly relates to the
  subject matter of the text.\r\n\r\nHelp.\r\n\r\nsuzanneski\r\n\r\n"

    embed.exe.\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/0gxvzsocqq6z2gr/embed.rar\r\nRemember
    to use this program only with the creator's permission.\r\nSami"

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nSorry to be so late getting back to you all, but I have been
    swamped, figuratively and literally.  (I live in Louisiana.)\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the responses.  I tried asking the font creator to fix it.  However, he did not
    know how to fix it and does not even have a program necessary for the task.  This
    is the only font he ever created.\r\n\r\nLuckily, someone from this group emailed
    me privately with great info.  Even though he had rescued me with the information
    I needed, it stressed me because I have become handicapped by Windows and am no
    longer sure of command line stuff.\r\n\r\nThis is the really amazing part.  I
    emailed High-logic, the folks who sell the FontCreator program.  I was so desperate
    that I was willing to buy the program just for one use, to fix this font.  However
    I did not have to.  They volunteered to fix the font for me for free so long as
    I would send them emails from the creator to verify that it was okay with him.
    \ Within hours, the font was mailed back to me, healed.   I am still amazed by
    the fact that they trashed a chance to make a profit to help a goober.  If I ever
    decide to add font creation to all my other endeavors, I will certainly deal with
    them.  I got great customer service without even being a customer.  \r\n\r\nThanks
    for all the responses and help.  My appreciation for humanity has been enhanced
    by this frustrating situation and caring people.\r\n\r\nHappy Mardi Gras.\r\nSuzanneski"

  body: Create outline for each page (actually you must for each individual text box)
    before exporting to pdf. Go to TYPE in the InDesign menu bar and then Create Outline.
    Make sure you first save a copy without creating outlines (because I don't think
    you can undo). Then you have made images of your text and you should be able to
    export the file to pdf. Does this make sense? Best, Anthony

  body: "Anthony, in general converting text to outlines is regarded as <em>circumventing</em>
    the EULA.\r\n\r\nI believe the intention of most EULAs is not to forbid embedding
    the font <em>an sich</em>, but instead to forbid using the font at all inside
    a PDF. Therefore, you are violating perhaps not the letter of the EULA, but certainly
    its spirit.\r\n\r\nEULAs tend to lag behind technical possibilities -- that is,
    if 'just outline the fonts' becomes common practice, it'll surely get mentioned
    that is allowed/not allowed next time."

    body: Yes, you are right, Theunis. Have never illegally outlined myself. In fact
      have only outlined at all when a small local print shop couldn't otherwise print
      the pdf

  body: "Here is what H & Co says about outlining: http://www.typography.com/faq/question.php?faqID=100\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThe
    simplest way to supply a logo to a client is to convert it to outlines in a drawing
    program. This saves the client from needing to license and install fonts, and
    it guarantees that the logo will appear exactly as you designed it.\r\n\r\nIf
    your client needs to install and use the fonts themselves, they\u2019ll need to
    license the fonts for their own use, which they can do through this site.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe
    problem with embedding the font is that it can be extracted from pdf or postscript
    files. However, with current technology, fonts need the opentype tables to produce
    a decent output and those tables are not embedded in printouts. Maybe I am wrong
    but I would expect that with current technology, trying to extract a font from
    a pdf file is outdated and that the problems with technological advances come
    more from web fonts and fonts for e-pub than from those for desktop publication."
