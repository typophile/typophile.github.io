body: "Today I received a copy of Robert Bringhurst's new publication, <em>The surface
  of meaning: books and book design in Canada.</em> It is a handsome, 'coffee-table'
  style book showing spreads from 160 years of Canadian printing, with much attention
  given to documenting the typefaces used and often with detail scans showing the
  type at large size. As one might expect in a survey compiled by Robert, ample coverage
  is given to publications in native languages with details of orthographies and some
  wonderful close-ups of these rare and interesting types. A series of essays connect
  the illustrated sections of the book.\r\n\r\nStrongly recommended."
