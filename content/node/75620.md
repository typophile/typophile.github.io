  body: Don't believe this is the font. Look at the E and S closer. The bar on the
    E is above center, and the top loop on the S is smaller then the bottom one.

  body: That's true of both your sample and Washington. (<a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeassociates/washington/?testdrive=src%3Dcustom%26text%3DPRESENTATION%26size%3D81%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3DFFFFFF%26w%3D720%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26dock%3Dfalse%26seed%3D33">Here's
    your sample word set in Washington.</a>) In what way are they different? Your
    sample is very small and pixelated, so there may be some distortion making it
    look a bit different. It's possible that it's a different cut of the same face.
    URW also has a version of it (<a href="http://www.houseoftype.com/prod_display.asp?group_id=WashingtonOTURW">link</a>)
    which is slightly different, particularly in the relative boldness of the weights.
