body: "Long-time lurker, first-time poster. <grin>\r\n\r\nI'd like to have a unique
  voice in my presentation materials. In the past, I have used Frutiger or Myriad
  (when they were uncommon in business or academic settings); however, now that they've
  become more common, I'm looking for something new. I've been eyeing Legato, but
  I don't know if that's the answer (though it could be).\r\n\r\nHere are my criteria:\r\n<ul>
  <li>I want to stay away from any font pre-installed with Windows, Mac OS, MS Office,
  or iWork.</li> <li>I'd like the 1,I,l and 0,O,o characters to be easily descernable,
  but I'm willing to compromise for the right font.</li> <li>The typeface should have
  some heavier weights, and look good at 30pts+ projected in black on a light background
  or white on a dark background.</li> </ul>\r\n\r\nI don't put too many words on a
  single \"slide.\" Usually it's fewer than six, but there are times that I will put
  a quote on the screen, and that's when I'll use a lighter weight and more words.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts would be appreciated. I'm not sure I want to go with Bliss, as it seems
  too similar to Gill Sans (the default for Keynote; I want to stay away), but I would
  consider it.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSteve"

  body: "Thanks, Riccardo, for that link. I knew I had seen a discussion like this,
    but I couldn't find it. It seemed to me that there were a few suggestions, but
    no resolution from the OP.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see something with a heavier weights
    than Yoga or Tschichold. I'm not sure about Gotham, as it seems to be a more commonly
    used typface. I'm looking at Mundo Sans, and Apex Sans. And Legato. And I'll check
    out Vectora (which, surprisingly, I have already).\r\n\r\nAnother poster suggested
    Agilita, which has some condensed weights as well (and has four fonts from the
    family at 85% off right now)."

  body: "Just used Chaparral for a presentation. Not necessarily uncommon, but it
    worked well (i.e., can deal with low projector resolutions). I have also used
    Brioso for projections, though, when I knew I would have a decent projector. I
    also did a presentation with Garamond Premier for text and Seria Sans for captions.
    People seem to favor sans for projections, but I've never felt there's a good
    reason to. Nearly any face can work, if you like it and the technology is capable
    of a reasonably faithful reproduction.\r\n\r\nEdit: I assumed that by \"presentation\"
    you were talking about projections, but if you are talking about printed handouts,
    then there is really no technical limitation. Choose something that represents
    the feel of your presentation and is appropriately legible, etc."
