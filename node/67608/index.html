		<div class="commentbody"><P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly, the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number 1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven’t handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners). In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href="http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/"><strong>louis vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the GHD MK1 to <a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/"><strong>coach factory outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition, with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing salon <a href="http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could still merely be making between <a href="http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href="http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i’m not really really sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href="http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on GHD hair straighteners, <a href="http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  then visit our website GHD IV Styler Stockists.Stories about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to britney’s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty, broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd’s usually are not all that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get those ghd’s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jean Paul,</p>
<p>I think this design is very good, with a nice feel, readability and personality. Italic is also very proportional and well done. But I guess the bold is somewhat excessive – it&rsquo;s almost a black style. The /e/ and /a/ storeys became very closed.</p>
<p>It would interesting to have a medium height to expand the family.</p>
<p>You may improve some little points:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> in /j/ the vertical nodes are misaligned;
<strong>2.</strong> in /k/ the bottom leg is very heavy;
<strong>3.</strong> in /T/ inclination of the right cut is out of font&rsquo;s general style;
<strong>4.</strong> in /s/ and /S/ there are small vector problems (bumps, misalignments) in curves;
<strong>5.</strong> difference in strokes of /A/ and /K/ are higher than one finds in other letters (N, W, Y).</p>
<p>Good job! Soon I also would like to hear your critique for the serif I&rsquo;m developing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Igor, many thanks for your comments! It&rsquo;s made my day.</p>
<p>The bold style is indeed actually a black style. Later on I&rsquo;ll interpolate the bold.
I&rsquo;ve opened up the a and e in the black styles a bit, much better readability indeed.
I&rsquo;ve also redrawn k, s and S, als much better. I&rsquo;m still working on the diagonal strokes in A, K, N, W, Y and Z, I always seem to have some difficulties with them. Is there any &ldquo;easy&rdquo; way to do them?
The right (and left) cut on the T is actually something that is repeated in E and F.</p>
<p>One question: what do you mean by point 1 (about j)? I don&rsquo;t see it&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an amateur type designer myself, so I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be of any use as a criticaster, nevertheless I&rsquo;ld really like to see your design for the serif!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post another PDF when I&rsquo;ve adjusted the diagonals in the capitals.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t notice the right cut at /T/ was also used in /F/ and /E/. Anyway, as this is very typical of /T/ in serifed, old style fonts, I think it becomes a bit strange to a contemporary, squarish sans. But this is subjective.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know an easy way to treat these diagonals – I also have dificulties to even the colour of /v/w/x/k/ strokes myself. My method is to analise how they do in other good fonts and test test test test&hellip; Hope Typophile fellows could help on this.</p>
<p>The /j/ is a minor issue:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Capturar_4730.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Probably you did work with two pieces and the nodes of one aren&rsquo;t aligned to grid. Illustrator sometimes does not align a node properly. This is usual after pathfinder and reflect operations, even if the original pieces have nodes aligned to grid. It seems to be a problem with the roundness of internal measures.</p>

This is all looking quite neat and tidy. 
I think B is a bit wide compared to the other letters. 
The italics need a bit of correction. Slanting alone has left the A and N particularly a bit unbalanced in weight and contrast.
Cap Y looks unbalanced somehow.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thats a really nice design. I like especially the thin connections of curves and verticals.</p>
<p>Some things that come to my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>You show a lot of contrast in your diagonals for example in V, W, k, x but no (or very low) contrast in diagonals of v.</li>
<li>Holes in R and P are okay (even if I personally dont like it) but R and P draw a lot of attention because they are the only 2 characters with those holes. I suggest to either drop those holes at all or put even more in other characters.</li>
<li>S is to heavy compared with other capitals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great work with the italic and bold. How do you do them? Do you have a Multiple Master of your design?</p>

I&rsquo;m still working on all diagonals (draw, redraw, redraw again and then redraw again). I&rsquo;m also working on the squarish bowls of /B/, /P/ and /R/.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve drawn these characters in Illustrator (I haven&rsquo;t yet bought FontLab, it&rsquo;s on my wish list), so no Multiple Master tools used here. I&rsquo;ve skewed the roman to make the italic, but that not really the way to do them, although it does seem to work. The bold style I&rsquo;ve drawn from scratch, with the regular style as a template.</p>
<p>I hope to post the updated PDF this weekend.</p>

<p>Let me come back to this in a day or two. I think you&rsquo;re definitely on a good path, but will need to examine the forms more closely to give useful advice.</p>
<p>The proportions are getting much more harmonious. However, a quick glance tells me you still need to resolve the contrast. A and x have quite noticeable contrast whilst other glyphs are a bit less pronounced. (Compare x with e for example.)</p>
<p>Did I say anything about the quotes/comma already? Forgive me, I&rsquo;m quite picky about commas for some reason, and I think yours need to be like curved rectangles instead of tadpoles to fit nicely in this design.</p>
<p>Your descenders look different lengths.</p>

<p>good job, a constant improvement! I see there is a very small misalignment inside the /k/ (both regular and bold). The cedilla seems a bit dislocated to left. And I guess the dot on /i/ bold is very much heavier if compared to the regular weight.</p>
<p>Well, it seems type design is mostly a male universe. This may explain why there are so many fonts with female names (Anna, Celeste, Victoria, Christiana, Ashley, Caecilia, Carolina, Emma, Isabela, Isadora, Joanna, Korinna, Shelley, Tiffany and so on&hellip;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It took me some time, but I&rsquo;ve updated the PDF.</p>
<p>Biggest change: considerable shortening of capitals, descenders and ascenders and in doing so visually enlarging x-height. I also feel that with these new caps the relationship in stroke thickness between lc and caps is much better and gives it a much more modern feel.
Contrast in /w/ black is still off&hellip;</p>
<p>Your thoughts please!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Looking good! I would make the strokes in glyphs like v, w, x and y the same size (optically) on the left and right. This is the way it is in most sans-serifs and I think that&rsquo;s because it looks better in context. I don&rsquo;t really like the fact that your dots on the i and j are higher than your ascender in the heavy weight. Maybe vertically compres them a bit? Aubaine is also looking great. It seems you really understand type. Could you have a look at my expletus?: <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/72368">http://www.typophile.com/node/72368</a></p>

<p>Looks great. The diagonal letters may need a bit of work though. While the /v/ is good, the /w/ looks like it&rsquo;s slanting backwards. The lower left leg of the x should move more to the left imo.</p>
<p>Black /a/ reminds me a bit of Unit - very nice.</p>

<p>I still need to (re)determine all diagonal stroke thicknesses, I find that very hard to do. And there&rsquo;s something wrong with the black a, I thinks it&rsquo;s too wide.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Jean Paul, this is looking great.</p>
<p>Regular:
-Double quotes don&rsquo;t match single quotes.
-Traps on A, Y etc could be deeper; I haven&rsquo;t printed this but it looks like the traps wouldn&rsquo;t do much.
-Knee of Kk looks dark.
-Xx could do with more stroke offset on the thins. Italic k needs more compensation.
-Comparing the bowl of a with the spine of s, it seems a is much squarer. Could they be harmonised more?</p>
<p>Black:
-q and b of the black weight look a bit too square in comparison to the regular. 
-Wordspace might be too narrow (or letterspace too loose)? 
-With w, try moving the two upper counters left a couple of notches.
-v might be too wide/dark.
-I wonder if e is a bit wide.</p>
