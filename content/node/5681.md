body: 'Hi! I am trying ti create a font &#40;using VOLT, but if anyone knows another
  tool, and how I could go through this, it would be appreciated too!&#41; which uses
  contextual substitution. However, it does not seem to be working. <BR>Would you
  give me some advise to complete this work? <BR> <BR>What I am trying to do is: <BR>
  <BR>say you have families 1,2,3,4 <BR> <BR>fam1=&#62;b, k, n, w, plus a special
  character &#40;consonantic group&#41; sh <BR> <BR>fam2=&#62;d, m, v, r &#43; dj
  &#40;left to right&#41; <BR> <BR>fam3=&#62;f, l, s, z &#43; tsh &#40;left to right&#41;
  <BR> <BR>fam4=&#62;g, p, t, y j <BR> <BR>########################## <BR>This is
  where my problem starts: <BR> <BR>now l and r have 2 forms:  <BR> <BR>-&#62;one
  as a first letter in the syllab <BR>-&#62;one as a mark when folllowing another
  consonant <BR> <BR>-&#62;m/n have two forms and become a mark when preceding a consonant.
  <BR> <BR>-&#62; vowels &#40;I forgot to say it before: y is considered a consonant&#41;
  have 6 forms which are the followings <BR> <BR>fam1 &#43; a=&#62;a_1 <BR>fam2 &#43;
  a=&#62;a_2 <BR>fam3 &#43; a=&#62;a_3 <BR>fam4 &#43; a=&#62;a_4 <BR>any vowel in
  forms stand-alone; 1 and 3 &#43; a=&#62; a_5 <BR> <BR>any vowel in forms 2 and 4
  &#43; a=&#62; a_6 <BR> <BR>and there is a form as a stand-alone letter &#40;the
  above applies to each vowel&#41;, which is the same as when following a vowel in
  form 5 or 6 <BR> <BR>How do I specify this to Volt? As I said before, if anyone
  knows how to do this with another tool, it would gratly help too! <BR> <BR>I have
  tried using th add feature, then add substitution , then type in the letters it
  should apply to, but when trying to compile it, it doesn&#39;t work at all. <BR>I
  am not using a standart script &#40;I made-up one&#41; maybe this is the source
  of the problem?  <BR>What if I change it to latn1, our arabic? <BR>The script is
  &#34;Mandombe&#34;, it is not supported by Unicode yet, &#40;well I couldn&#39;t
  find it listed in the unicode list, however, all characters are supported, but spread
  accross several scripts&#41;. <BR> <BR>The language settings I am using in VOLT
  are: <BR>language=default <BR>script=mand <BR>If I change the language defaut to,
  say us, or English, will that help? <BR>If I change the scrip to a recognized one,
  will that change anything? <BR> <BR>It would be great if you could find some time
  to help me with that, I am totally lost, and I hope there is enough information
  on what I a m trying to do, if not let me know.'
