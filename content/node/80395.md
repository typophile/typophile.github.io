body: "In case you hadn't heard about it, I thought I'd give a mention to Ampersand,
  a one-day conference specifically focussing on web typography.\r\n\r\nIt will be
  held in the famous Brighton Dome Corn Exchange, in the seaside town of Brighton,
  UK on Friday 17th June 2011.\r\n\r\nAmpersand is an affordable one-day event for
  knowledgable web designers & type enthusiasts. The idea is to represent the overlapping
  worlds of type design, web design and software, and the event should be a fun day
  of nitty gritty details from experts in font design & development, typesetting &
  font usage, browser implementations, and with glimpses of a bright typographic future.\r\n\r\nThe
  line up will be:\r\n\r\n* Vincent Connare\r\n* Jon Tan (web designer & cofounder
  of Fontdeck)\r\n* Jonathan Hoefler\r\n* David Berlow\r\n* Tim Brown (type manager
  for Typekit)\r\n* John Daggett (Firefox developer & editor of the CSS3 Fonts Module)\r\n*
  Mark Porter (former creative director of guardian.co.uk)\r\n\r\nMore information
  at [[http://ampersandconf.com/|ampersandconf.com]] and on Twitter at [[http://twitter.com/ampersandconf|@ampersandconf]]\r\n\r\nAmpersand
  is sponsored by [[http://fontdeck.com|Fontdeck]], [[http://typekit.com|Typekit]],
  [[http://typography.com|Hoefler & Frere-Jones]], [[http://webtype.com|Webtype]].\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,
  Rich."
