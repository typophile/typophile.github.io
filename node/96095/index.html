  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here's the proposal so far. Tell me what's wrong with it. Please.

For Font Buyers:
1.	Understandable Licensing: all fonts licensed through iLUVfonts.com for traditional “print-based” projects will be subject to a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 End User Licensing Agreement. Period.
2.	All fonts distributed through iLUVfonts.com will be digitally signed and certified virus-free.
3.	All fonts distributed through iLUVfonts.com will carry a unique serial number, to safeguard your purchase against unauthorized piracy.
4.	Forever Font Insurance: for a nominal fee, each font license through iLUVfonts.com will carry a lifetime, free upgrade option. Any revisions to the content or form—at any future date, until you drop dead—of any iLUVfonts font will be free to insured buyers, who will receive email notification of such upgrades, and a special download code for fulfillment.
5.	In an effort to keep Customer Service costs down, all fonts licensed through iLUVfonts.com will be sold as-is, no refunds and no exchanges, and no exceptions. If a bona fide technical flaw exists in sold fonts, buyers will receive a free upgrade, whether or not they participate on the Forever Fonts Insurance program.

Embedding Rights
1.	Webfont distribution will be handled by a selected partner exclusively, who will handle all licensing, distribution and billing issues.
2.	Embedding in electronic documents and videogames will follow a simple percentage-of-retail-price formula, the amount of which will be determined by forecast gross sales figures.  Licensing fees will be paid to Licensor at each individual point of sale. No perpetual licenses will be issued, nor will global rights be assigned under any cisrumstances,
3.	Until Apple makes its App codebase less susceptible to hacking, requests for embedding fonts in any Bezier format within App Store apps will be respectfully denied.

For Vendors of Customized Products
1.	Vendors who provide customized products may access the complete iLUVfonts catalog via a special plug-in to the vendor’s website. For a single, flat, reasonable one-time fee, the vendor’s customers may use selected fonts in their projects, whether or not it is a single-word headline or extensive text for a hard-copy document. Furthermore, vendors and their customers will have access to a comprehensive collection of graphic elements, available for one-time licensing at a very attractive price.

For Educational Institutions
1.	Special Promotional Rates for enrolled students, access to online resources to support learning, and an opportunity for students to engage in real-world projects by designing specimen sheets for any product in the font catalog. “Winning” entries, determined by a majority of peers, will appear on the iLUVfonts website, with full credit given to the winners.

For Sellers of Fonts.
1.	Low Overhead: all commissions, fees and accounting charges will be limited to no more than 25% of each sale and, ideally, substantially less. In return, vendors will be responsible for all content creation to support their sales through a template-based CMS system.
2.	Access to Digital Signature, Unique Serial Number and Forever Font Insurance Protection at no additional cost to vendor.
3.	Flexible Payment Options: choose either Immediate Payment at Point of Sale, or 30-day Carryover Plan. Immediate Payment Plan users will be subject to the access fee charged by our payment processor, but will have full access to their funds as they accrue. The 30-day Carryover Plan will eliminate this fee, and funds will be transferred to vendor’s bank account every thirty days, within five days of the close of each month. If the amount being carried over globally meets certain thresholds, Carryover Plan participants may opt into an insured Money Market plan, administered by an independent, accredited investment firm, which will allow investors to make a return their Carryover funds.
4.	Organic Evolution: as traffic grows, additional incentives to customers will be added, including but not limited to discussion forums, a TypoWiki, online specimen book library, and Webinars, featuring video interviews with noted luminaries in the fields of typography, graphic design, and so forth.

Ask the creative commons folks or, better yet, read the licensing agreement yourself…

		<div class="commentbody">I think you linked to the wrong licence, this should be the right one: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

This kind of licence effectively makes the fonts free to share and modify, which is a bit of a contradiction to the digital signature and personalized serial number stuff, it seems to me.

One more thing to ponder: Do the "attribution" and "share alike" requirements of the CC licence apply only to the fonts themselves, or also to works created using the fonts?</div>

Thanks for correcting the link.

As I read the license, the ORIGINAL COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL—i.e., the font itself—is still protected and cannot be copied or redistributed except by specific waiver in writing from the creator of the font...

<em>4.c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.</em>

<em>4.d Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.</em>

In other words…

If someone uses one of my fonts to create a logotype, then the author of the logotype owns the rights to the logotype, but not the font used to create it—or, at least, that's the way that I read the license. If you know of a better one, please let me know. All I was looking for was a COMMON standard that iLUVfonts buyers could rely on, instead of all of this silly shit with mod-no mod...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As Jens said: if you releases it as CC BY-SA it means anyone can download it and offer it for free on a different website. All who download it from this website will get the same serial number.

And as spiral mentioned: “Attribution” requires an attribution every time the font is used. This would even include a logotype. 

To put it simple: Those CC licenses are not really suitable for fonts …</div>
