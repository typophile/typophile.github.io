  and wanted to ask you guys for some names of designers who have made successful
  typeface within the last 20 years. I have all the older more obvious designers,
  but my lecturer wants more recent guys even though she could not even name any,
  so if i can get some help with this that would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks, Luke."

    awards\r\n- durability\r\n- profitable\r\n- typographic excellence\r\n-used by
    \"good\" typographers\r\n\r\nAnd what do you mean by sans?\r\n\r\nFor instance,
    Ray Larabie's Neuropol was much used as a free font, but is a quirky rounded techno
    face, and such artefacts of the rave scene (like the psychedelic scene earlier)
    have never received much critical or academic acclaim. Although it was used for
    the Torino Olympics."

    and graphic designers will be a good definition for the kind of success i am looking

    to get some basic information before refining it more once i know what i want

    won't have enough depth to it and wasn't really sure in what direction to take
    it, and how to actually compare them in a not so obvious way.\r\n\r\nAnyone have

    really appreciate any suggestions, whether to stick with the comparing typefaces
