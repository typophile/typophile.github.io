    paraphrase a Jay Leno joke, porn magazines are for the 5 guys who haven't discovered
    the internet yet.  :)\r\n\r\nYears ago I was involved in a gift exchange at work
    where you picked someone's name out of a hat and had to give them small gifts
    anonymously over the year; then at the office Christmas party each person would
    try to guess who had been giving them gifts. I decided to use the 7 deadly sins
    as a theme for my gifts. I gave the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue to represent
    \"lust\", and little bag of coin-shaped chocolates for \"greed\", etc. Can't remember
    the rest, but anyway it was fun."
