  character is driving me crazy. Was it intended to be like that or just an oversight(
  which i don't think it is). Don't get me wrong,  it is an amazing font but..."

  body: a lot of Meta's appeal is it's uniqueness.  Have you seen the g?

  body: Yes. A very innovative and a unique g and I love it. But still why y?

    in position or form, alteration, transposition: metathesis, metasomatism.\r\n\r\ngoing
    beyond or higher, transcending: used to form terms designating an area of study

    field."

  body: "<cite>the 'y' character is driving me crazy. </cite>\r\n\r\nWhy? It's a valid
    design principle to draw it this way \u2014 especially for typefaces intended
    for smaller sizes. If the strokes would meet exactly at the baseline, then it
    would look optically incorrect. The way it is drawn in Meta (and some other typefaces)
    it stresses the character's anchoring on the baseline. "

  body: "Ryan, LOL. Meta was intended to be a workhorse typeface for the German Post
    Office. It\u2019s safe to assume there was no philiosophical thinking involved.
    (And it was called PT55 originally.)\r\n\r\nInstead, consider what would be the
    alternative for the y?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/meta-y_4122.png]\r\n\r\n(Top
    is the original in Normal, Bold, Black)\r\n\r\nThe cut in the falling diagonal
    prevents a black spot and accentuates the baseline. At least that\u2019s what
    I think."
