  image. It's a screenshot from a newsletter sent by Nike and although I was thinking
  it may be Futura, my eyes fail me. The S, G, and R differ and I would like to possibly
  use this font in an upcoming project. Thank you for your time, I look forward to
  your feedback and thoughts. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-shot_5475.jpg]"

  body: "Renko, I would say Gotham is very close. However, the \"M\" does not dip
    all the way down the middle. It stops midway, and another portion of this newsletter
    I I have the \"M\" dips all the way down to the baseline. It is very close nonetheless.
    \r\n\r\nI've posted another screen shot to see the letters in orange. The \"M\"
    is visible in that part. Any further thoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-shot-lrg_5893.jpg]"

  body: akira1975 thanks for your reply. Freight Sans looks spot on but I'm questioning
    the "R" and the width of the "U". I did sample it at 24pt on the site you linked
    me to and if it is this one, I'm buying it tonight. Thank you.

  body: Thanks akira, you are right. It is Freight Sans and it renders better in the
    sample view on Fontshop. I will look into purchasing this font later this week.
    Thank you for your help.
