  am trying to find a font software for a PC computer that has a good variety of fonts,
  and not those cheesy fonts either.  Does anyone have any recommendations as to what
  sites to look on or what specific cd I should look for?  '

    Learning&#39; is an amazing bargain. Bitstream I believe also has reasonably priced
    CD type collections. '

  body: If you&#39;re not eligible for educational pricing, then check out our &#34;Adobe
    Type Basics OpenType Edition.&#34; There are some cheesy display fonts in here,
    but also a lot of good solid classic text faces, and some fairly innovative newer
    stuff &#40;Blue Island, Nyx&#41;. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1902.jhtml"

  body: Bitstream&#39;s Type Odyssey 2. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s pretty comprehensive of
    the classics, although some of them are peculiarly renamed. there is some cheese,
    but also a large &#34;taster&#34; from a bunch of contemporary foundries.

    done with it? Examples? <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

    right design project to come along so I can buy &amp; use it.

  body: a bit of a tangent, but I&#39;m a student and have been thinking about buying
    the type classics for learning for some time now. Mainly because I need at least
    one good expert text family, with short caps and such, <BR> <BR>But I also just
    ordered InDesign, does anyone know if InDesign includes any type families on the
    install CDs? <BR>

  body: Yes, InDesign does include a number of fonts. I posted the list of fonts bundled
    with InDesign CS &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?13@29.Sv5gbbs1DYa.164829@.2ccde63e/4&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;.

  body: 'That&#39;s an impressive list, you could do some serious typography with
    those. <BR> <BR>There are a variety of serif classics, full family, but Myriad
    is the only sans, and only in the Condensed. <BR> <BR>One thing missing from the
    Adobe CDs, and Bitstream, are pixel fonts. '

  body: The list gets much better if you buy the full Creative Suite &#40;or even
    just Illustrator&#41;. Then you get a lot more of the Myriad Pro family. <BR>
    <BR>Don&#39;t ask me to explain why InDesign CS only has the Condensed for Myriad.

    it is 38 fonts for $42 and the best bit is the whole thing is a charity project
    to raise the money to build two orphanages for kids with Aids in Africa. <BR>
    <BR>It may not be a full font collection, but it is a very cost effective and
    charitable way to add to your font collection. <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>===
