  fonts!\r\n[[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.filippomariapanelli.typefacesfree|Get
  it on Google Play.]]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe first typography game for Android is
  here!\r\n\r\nTest your ability to identify common fonts with three levels of difficulty.\r\nYou
  are shown a small piece of text formatted using one of many common fonts and you
  have to guess the right name of the font within 4 choices.\r\n\r\nAt the end of
  the game you can see your correct and incorrect answers. If you answered one question
  incorrectly you can compare how the text looks like in the font you chose with the
  original text and learn the differences."
