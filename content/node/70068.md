body: "A month ago, mainly as personal experience, i started these two families: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/795795/typography/tapanapantera.html
  and https://dl.dropbox.com/u/795795/typography/dogull.html\r\n\r\n(they are temporarily
  there while http://nitrofurano.linuxkafe.com/typography/tapanapantera.html and http://nitrofurano.linuxkafe.com/typography/dogull.html
  are offline for a while for technical reasons)\r\n\r\nThe first were based on an
  academic work i did 10 years ago (an analysis on how can work together the roman
  square captials (lapidaria) with carolingian calligraphic lowercases, in a geometric
  sans-serif typeface ), and the other were a research and analysis desconstruction
  (not a ripoff) of how better readable can be a typeface based on Gustav Jaeger's
  Catull in a sans-serif drawing.\r\n\r\nPlease note i wanted to deserve the same
  importance to smallcaps as to italics, and the italics being not slanted are intentional,
  since the first italic typefaces from Aldus Manutius and Lodovico Arrighi were not
  that slanted as well, and i wanted to assume them unslanted at all.\r\n\r\nOf course
  both typeface sketches are hugelly plenty of naive mistakes, but i'd ask you all
  here for your oppinions, suggestions, comments, ideas, references, etc., and the
  bluntest comments are even more welcome! :)\r\n\r\nAnd if both of these families
  are a complete disaster, please help me knowing which useful parts of them would
  be great to utilize and improve in future works.\r\n"
