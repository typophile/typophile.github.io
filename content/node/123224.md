  body: "I have a guess that this is a condensed version of something like Frutiger
    or Myriad that has been made wider. When I try this with Myriad Bold Condensed
    it is close, but the S is not as closed as your sample. I don't have Frutiger
    to play with. One reason I think it has been extended is the thin horizontals
    and wide verticals. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
