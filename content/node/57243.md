    where you can watch these lectures live.\r\nThis really gave me a new admiration
    of Antique Olive (and I think I was pronouncing it wrong for years...)\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks, that is very interesting. I particularly liked his contrast of pattern
    vs rhythm. Olson likes typefaces to have not simply pattern, but rhythm, by which
    means that they have a sense of momentum or forward motion. His illustration of
    how Klavika does this, as contrasted with one of this other faces was revealing.

    add, informative! Thank you, Nicole and Eric.
