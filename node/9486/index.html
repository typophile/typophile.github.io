  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&#39;ve got a long business document to format. It contains many acronyms. <BR> <BR>The source text, which I received in Microsoft Word format, uses full caps for all the acronyms. I think small caps would be better, but am encountering the following problems: <BR> <BR>&#42; Some of the acronyms are pluralised. For example, Local Authoritity is abbreviated to LA, but the text often refers to more than one and uses the term LAs. When I set this in small caps, it looks like LAS, which is no good. <BR> <BR>&#42; Acronyms will occasionally start a sentence. To me, starting a sentence in small caps looks wrong. But using a full cap for the initial, followed by small caps, looks weird too. <BR> <BR>Ideas? I did try a search and Bringhurst, but there&#39;s no satisfactory conclusion. Some mention was given of faces with two different small cap heights, to overcome this problem &#40;I think Mrs Eaves was cited&#41;. Can anyone show me what this looks like?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; When I set this in small caps, it looks like LAS, which is no good. <BR> <BR>Which is why smallcaps are best when they&#39;re visibly taller than the lc x-height. Unfortunately most fonts have smallcaps that are too short. BTW, many people put an apostrophe when pluralizing an acronym, but I think that&#39;s a sad fallback. <BR> <BR>As for the initial-acronym situation, I certainly wouldn&#39;t &#34;capitalize&#34; it! You might just use full-caps there, especially if your font has smallish smallcaps. <BR> <BR>BTW, the richest font I know in terms of smallcaps is FF Atma: <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/atma-serif/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/atma-serif/</a> <BR>And it&#39;s decently spaced. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I always thought that small caps were supposed to be level with the x-height. The only reason why they recently have not, was because people used shrunken caps and if they did it at the x-height then it would be way to thin. Of course doing it at 70% also thins it out but isn&#39;t as bad as doing it at the x-height.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I usually make my small caps larger than x-height, more so if the x-height is small. There is a lot of historical precedent for this, Rafael.  <BR> <BR>But I don&#39;t think there is a formula. Goudy even made the SC of Italian Oldstyle smaller than the LC x-height &#40;what a show-off&#41;, and it looked OK. So that&#39;s worth examining, and it confirms that a glyph contains a sense of scale.  <BR> <BR>Italian Old Style &#40;the metal version&#41; has very small counters in the bowls of the a and e, and is very tightly fitted. If you compare the counters in the SC &#34;E&#34; with that in the &#34;e&#34;, they are of a similar size. And the SC is openly fitted &#40;ie it looks &#34;tracked out&#34;&#41;. So the LC looks like a bigger &#34;optical size&#34; setting than it really is, and the SC look like a very small optical size setting of a cap. Hence they work together. &#40;This beforesaid concerns the sense of scale of proportion for letter stem lengths and negative space; detailing such as stem and serif thicknesses is more about consistency of absolute values between SC and LC.&#41;  <BR> <BR>So, if a typeface has small caps that look too small when they are set beside the lower case, they are not well designed. If a typographer is going to tinker with the setting to compensate for this, I would suggest combining three imperceptible adjustments:  <BR>1&#41; increase the SC size by a fraction of a point, such as 0.2. <BR>2&#41; increase the tracking of the small caps, possibly by quite a lot. <BR>3&#41; increase the horizontal scaling of the SC by a couple of percentage points.This is a technique that digital type designers often use when they are developing their small caps from the big uns, but you might decide a little more is required. <BR> <BR>There is not necessarily anything wrong with a typeface if you feel it is necessary to do this; it may be that some typefaces require a little more effort to work with than others of more easy virtue, or that typefaces not naturally suited to the requirements of a typographer or a project require some special treatment. Massaging a reluctant typeface to the requirements of a project can often result in more distinguished work than going with the most obvious or most comfortable choice. <BR> <BR>By way of a test to determine how thorough a typeface design really is, set the three &#34;O&#34;s &#40;cap, sc, and lc&#41; and the two zeros &#40;lining and oldstyle&#41; beside each other and compare how differentiated they are with how well they harmonize.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Raphael, it seems you&#39;re talking about &#34;optimal&#34; <i>fake</i> caps, while the main issue here deals with fonts which have smallcaps provided... But come to think of it, Nick&#39;s idea of doing some &#34;fake&#34; stuff with the true smallcaps might be just the thing!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Nick, I think larger apparent size certainly helps, but it&#39;s not enough - sort of how an upright italic doesn&#39;t work for emphasis: cursiveness usually helps, but alone it&#39;s too weak. Consider the &#34;LAs&#34; example: the lc &#34;s&#34; being a bit narrower than the SC one would not resolve the confusion. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">No, I was meaning real small caps. I was saying that according to my understanding people have got used to small caps being larger than the x-height because people used fake small caps and that fake small caps were larger than they &#34;should be&#34; because to make them the &#34;correct&#34; size would make them too thin. <BR> <BR>Of course it was always my understanding that true small caps were supposed to be x-height without really thinking about why I thought that.

		<div class="commentbody">Small caps go way back, as a form of contrast. Before there were sans serifs, or bold faces, and when it was a real pain to change size, printers would use the four main styles: Roman Caps, RomanU&amp;lc, Roman SC, Italic U&amp;lc, as their &#34;palette&#34; of tonality.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;I just finished typesetting a 180 pg academic text in Adobe Caslon &#40;the new-ish pro OTF version&#41;. Tremendous number of acronyms, and, unfortunately, many in quoted text, which had to be set in italics. The font lacks an italic SC so I had to use 16-degree-obliqued smallcaps, slightly fudged to match the weight of the italic - you don&#39;t want to know what I had to do. <BR> <BR>I love this face but the small-cap height is too low and the plural acronym problem came up again and again. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately FF Atma would likely cost me several dozen hours&#39; worth of wages and I just can&#39;t afford the investment now, so I end up with another, perhaps finer &#40;that is, finer than, say, &#34;fake&#34; smallcaps&#41;, but still less-than perfect way of kludging it. <BR> <BR>The other face I&#39;d really like to be using for book work is Mark van Bronkhorst&#39;s wonderful Verdigris family, but it doesn&#39;t yet have all the features I need it to.</div>
