  have a logo using this font and am looking for some ideas for combinations that
  can offset the playfulness without going too far in the other direction that it
  looks out of place. It's for their website and printed materials. It's a creative
  company and they are looking for playful but modern.\r\n\r\nI appreciate any fresh
  ideas!\r\nLori\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
