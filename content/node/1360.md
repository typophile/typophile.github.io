  body: You&#39;ve got it Yves. I checked the sample of Hellenic Wide in the &#34;Encyclopaedia
    of Type Faces&#34; by Jaspert, et al, and sure enough that&#39;s it. Same R and
    same 2. <BR> <BR>Good work!

  body: I&#39;m still not sure about those CSA Images fonts though.  <BR>There&#39;s
    quite a few rip-offs amongst them, but they  <BR>also happen to have digitizations
    of hard to find and  <BR>sought after vintage type.

    She doesn&#39;t know where it came from. <BR> <BR>Has anyone heard of this? I
    did a brief search and found nothing. <BR> <BR>Troy'

  body: Yes, it was in an old FontBank collection. &#40;Turns out I actually have
    this collection, so I found it in the pamphlet when you wrote the name.&#41; The
    fonts are still sold for $2 each at  <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/hefty.htm"
    target="_blank">BuyFonts.com</a> and you can see the Hefty showing at the link.
