body: This may be in the [[typowiki|wiki]] somwhere, and I've looked through the [[sans_serif|sans
  serif]] entry, but I'm wondering what the difference is between [[gothic]] faces
  and [[grotesque]]. Or are they really the same thing? Just different names for what
  we now call sans-serif?

  body: "Mac McGrew 1986, \r\nGothic, the purists say, is Blackletter or what we more
    often call Old English. But the name is so firmly established in American usage
    as meaning a plan block letter without serifs or hairline, that we must accept
    that meaning. Also, it is part of many type names. But we prefer to go further,
    and reserve the term gothic for the traditional forms, and san serif for the modified
    forms orginating in Germany with the Bauhaus movement of the 1920s. Our preferrred
    general term is serifless.\r\n\r\nfirst portion of text from p. 155. "

  body: "I don't think this is an official distinction by any means, but I've sensed
    a trend to apply the term \"grotesque\" to old victorian and wood-type sans serifs
    (in the Railroad Gothic / Poplar / Champion / Knockout style), \"gothic\" to more
    refined versions of the same basic structure (Akzidenz, Alternate Gothic, Franklin
    Gothic, Lightline Gothic, News Gothic, Trade Gothic, et al) and \"neogrotesque\"
    to sans-serifs refined in the Swiss style (such as Folio, Helvetica, Univers and
    the like).\r\n\r\nHas anyone else sensed a similar distinction?\r\n\r\nDavid Thometz"

  body: "> American ATF inspired/derivative typeface from Akzidenz Grotesque.\r\n\r\nI
    don't see how Franklin Gothic has much to do with Akzidenz Grotesque. Franklin
    Gothic has more thick-thin contrast, and the two story g, the s doesn't close
    on itself, the top terminal of the c is fatter than the bottom, etc etc. \r\n\r\nAlternate
    Gothic is condensed, and, looking at my old edition of Jaspert,resembles the condensed
    versions of Akzidenz (Standard),except with the two story g. But the condensed
    versions of Akzidenz (Standard) don't look much like the regular and wider versions
    of Akzidenz, which seem to be the basis for Helvetica. \r\n\r\nIt may well be
    that Benton had German sources for Alternate Gothic. But Franklin seems to me
    very unlikely to have come from Akzidenz. More likely a redrawing of existing
    American faces, I would guess. \r\n\r\nIs there an historian out there who can
    give us the correct story?"
