body: "I wonder if anyone here might have a decent showing of the old Art Nouveau
  typeface Kobe that they might be willing to scan and send my way. Right now all
  I've got is a small, low-res, curled page scan.\r\n\r\nI need Kobe (solid), not
  Kobe Open.\r\n\r\nAmongst all of my books and catalogs, I find only one limited
  showing of Kobe Open \u2013 which is useless for my needs. I don't think that it
  is on any of the Dover/Dan Solo CD-ROMs, but perhaps in one of their 100 Font picture
  books?"

    be helpful...

  body: "Mike,\r\n\r\nI make no guarantees that I can find it, but Dan Solo gave me
    several assorted specimen sheets a his typeface catalog in the late '80s ( I can't
    remember if Kobe was included). It's probably buried under at least a ton of paper,
    but if I can find it over the weekend I will scan and send it to you.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, you can tell by the junk I kept!"

    Or, I could post it for all of us to see as well.
