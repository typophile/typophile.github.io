  body: "If they are OpenType format, check them out at FontShop.com or Myfonts.com.\r\n\r\nIf
    they are Type 1 or TrueType, the old style figures are in a separate \"SC+osf\"
    font."

    also has both figure styles.\r\nBut most modern sanserifs offer both styles."

  body: The finest sans-serif on the market, Linotype Syntax, carries both lining
    and oldstyle figures. So does Stone Sans and Legacy Sans from ITC (not from Adobe).
    FF Bau comes with default-loaded OSFs, very stylish.

  body: "<em>How have I managed to miss this until now?</em>\r\n\r\nPerhaps because
    the major layout applications which support OpenType (and let's be thankful they
    do) have never made it easily accessible. Illustrator is an exception--in that
    program it's possible to have the OpenType palette open on the \"top deck\".\r\n"
