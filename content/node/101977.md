  League Night from House Industries is very close to the latter and I could probably
  use it to manipulate but any help on the R would be greatly appreciated.

    the font and want to make a completely different design for my summer league team...I
    saw this font and like it. If you know the font name, that is all that I am looking
    for. Really, not trying to steal anything away from Disneyland.\r\n\r\nEthan"

    body: defiantone - Thanks for the suggestion. The R is definitely a tough one
      to identify. It may be an old hand drawn typeface as well.

    target='_blank'>Jaecker Schrift</a> (revival by Petra Heidorn of Wilhelm Jaecker's
    1912 typeface). I would think drawing from scratch would be easier.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes - hand drawn seems likely."
