body: "Hello Typophiles, \r\n\r\nBeen a bit since I posted here but thought I would
  check out what was going on in the world of Type. I have been working a lot on type
  lately and have 5 or so faces to release. I also will be at TypeCon so if you are
  there too, hit me up. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_tap_5565.jpg]\r\nThis
  typeface is called Tapscott and has a jazz feel to it. I incorporated a lot of alternate
  letters and character combinations so it feels fresh if you are wanting a custom
  type feel. We have been doing a lot of hand-drawn faces lately at the YWFT offices
  and we normally do at least one alternate for every letter to keep it fresh. I basically
  took a sans look and added some ligature options to be used sparingly. \r\n\r\nMore
  info here:\r\nhttp://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0178\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_neigh_5252.jpg]\r\nThis
  is Neighborhood, designed by YWFT's Travis Stearns. This is his first working typeface
  and think he did a good job on it. The font contains tons of extra characters as
  well and took him a bit to complete. He reworked it a lot and think the final output
  is a unique hand-drawn serif. \r\n\r\nMore info here:\r\nhttp://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0169\r\n\r\nWell
  just thought I would put these out there and show what we have been doing lately!
  :)"
