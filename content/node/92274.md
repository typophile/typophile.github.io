    announcements for the issuance of US Postage stamps. The US Postal Service has
    a record of those (certainly the National Archives would have them).\r\n\r\nOf
    course, they have never used fonts - metal, digital, or otherwise, although they
    may have used patterns. Each stamp die, including the lettering, was hand-engraved.\r\n\r\n
