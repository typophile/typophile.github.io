  body: "The \"Coffee Can\" name came from the Solotype Catalog (p.36), and of course
    this typeface also was the inspiration for <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/rosewood/\">Rosewood</a>,
    with its overused 'Fill' face.   The Adobe background backs up what you said Florian.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "David Rakowski even got around to using it for his \"Buffalo Bill\" font
    that was distributed by Intecsas. FontFactory apparently still distributes these,
    but they don't show a sample. It was shown in the old Precision Type Font Reference
    Guide (alas, Precision type).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
