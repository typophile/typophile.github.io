body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThe font Europa Arabesque was originally licensed by Monotype
  from FontHaus, as evidenced by this (very old) trademark PDF over at fontwise.com:\r\nhttp://www.fontwise.com/PDFs/Trademarks.pdf\r\n\r\nHowever,
  it doesn't seem to be commercially available any longer, but is available on at
  least one free site:\r\nhttp://www.fontsner.com/font/EuropaArabesque-49394.html\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know of any alternate cuts or who the original designer might be?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid"
