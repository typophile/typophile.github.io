  body: However, when I try comparing the two, this is clearly not Mrs Eaves. It&#39;s
    probably a Garamond, looking at the &#39;e&#39; and &#39;s&#39;, but my books
    don&#39;t show all the ligatures. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33571.gif"

  body: This somehow matches <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1712.jhtml"
    target="_blank"> Adobe Caslon Pro</a>. Maybe they  <BR>messed about with the &#34;ct&#34;
    ligature in order to create  <BR>the &#34;it&#34; which is not available in the
    glyph set?

    also sports &#39;il and &#39;it&#39; ligatures in this style. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33710.gif"
