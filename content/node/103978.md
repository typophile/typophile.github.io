  body: 'This one is Padaloma Italic. I don''t want to link to it because to me, it
    looks like a rip-off of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/compacta-sb|Compacta
    Black]]. Some letters has been edited (/d, /g...) and the result has been re-published
    under a different name. Alternative: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/loft|Loft]]'
