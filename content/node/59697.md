body: "Hello. I'm new to this site and I'd like some feedback on a font I initially
  developed in the fall.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/centra_5347.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/centraskeleton_5334.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  \"drew\" it all in Illustrator CS and used TypeTool to actually make it into a font
  file. It is based on circles and lines. Every curved element is an arc cut right
  off a circle. You can see this in the image where I mark the arcs in magenta and
  the lines in cyan.\r\n\r\nI'd like to remake this entirely in TypeTool because I'm
  pretty clueless with that program, and going from Illustrator to TypeTool didn't
  give me the precision I wanted. Ideally this is for display, so i don't see it getting
  any smaller than 16pt. The construction allows for multiple weights to easily be
  added.\r\n\r\nSo, thoughts? Any particular characters that don't work in the circle/line
  structure? Any recommendations for good TypeTool tutorials? Are there basic type
  things I'm overlooking/destroying?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help.\r\n\r\nP.S. I call
  it Centra. The name sounds like a mash up of Century and Futura, which wasn't intended.
  It is supposed to suggest circles. Thoughts?"

    I like the whole spirit of it, but you follow too strictly the geometrical proportions
    - which does make it look somehow unbalanced. Visual balance is not an exact plain
    geometry. \r\n\r\nC is too wide, while H is too narrow. K is quite close to H,
    so try to make the difference between them more obvious. M seems too wide, but
    maybe it's just me; same goes for U. One of the hardest ones to draw - S - looks
    nice, but again unproportionally narrow. Generally you get the idea, the width
    of some of the characters bothers the eye.\r\n\r\nThe height of lowercase t is
    too small - no ascender at all, and looks considerably thinner than the other
    characters - obviously this is just an optical illusion, but you need to compensate
    this. Here I should repeat the width matter too - the y is too wide in comparison
    to v, for example.\r\n\r\nBoth Z's - uppercase and lowercase - seem too rounded
    to be distinctive. Same goes for numbers 3 and 5, which look interesting, but
    do not match with the other characters.\r\n\r\nThese are just my 2\xA2, so better
    wait for more qualified opinion - after all I'm still an amateur in this field."

    is when rounded letters (like O and C) exceed the cap line and the baseline as
    opposed to straight letters (like E and T and L) that sit on the baseline not
    below it and they do not exceed the cap line. I's not as noticeable in a lightweight
    like the one you have here but when you start building the bold version (which
    you should) you'll start noticing the C and O to be shorter than the rest if you
    don't pay attention to offshoot.\r\n\r\nThere's a million things to fix here but
    start with ditching the grid and fixing the widths as mentioned above.\r\nThe
    fact that you have a basic character set is a great start and I really like the
    \"a\" and \"q\".\r\n\r\nKeep us updated."
