  body: Looks like manipulated Trajan with stretching added to the cropping and Photoshop
    effects.

  body: "Trajan? If it's a modified anything, it's more likely to be Times.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"cuts\" have a distinctly ill-considered air about them, so it's probably something
    of a custom rush-job."

  body: Heh, I forgive you, Chris. Props for the dedication in demonstrating the technique
    - it is, as you say, a go. Shame they didn't spend a little more time on it, though.

  body: "I'm gonna be an immovable douchebag and stick by my Times.\r\n\r\nI've laid
    Times LT, stretched, over the original image and, bar a tiny discrepancy on the
    V, it matches pretty nearly perfectly. It may be even closer with Times New Roman.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alivetimes_3776.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnother
    indicator that it may be Times is that they've used a freebie for the rendering
    of the band name on the artwork - A fanmade extrapolation of the Kingdom Hearts
    logo.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/kingdom-hearts.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Blaze+Bayley\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AliveInPoland.jpg\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, Aviano is lovely. And a much better choice."

  body: "This quite possibly could've been a fantastic title, too bad it was, as been
    stated, most likely rushed.\r\nBut then I just saw the whole artwork...I don't
    think I can stand by the above statement anymore. The whole piece needed more
    brainstorming."

  body: Indeed, Times is a closer match (if not the actual font). I'm surprised to
    see it took the stretching fairly well.
