  body: ' Thanks for that feedback Jonathan. I have a pretty unconventional understanding
    of typography and I&#39;m not totally clear on &#34;Wild Style&#34;. the only
    Wild Style i&#39;m familiar with is the 80&#39;s movie about hiphop/graffiti,
    and a graffiti style where the letters are almost unreadable with complex &#34;ligatures&#34;
    but I have a feeling you&#39;re talking about something else, right? '

  body: ' Phil - Boozefighter is a piece of work. To paraphrase Joe, Weee, it&#39;s
    Buffy the Cowgirl. It says woodtype to me, but it is certainly not something I&#39;ve
    seen before. So that&#39;s a good thing. <BR> <BR>The few things I would examine...
    <BR> <BR>The Z and the T have razorsharp terminals. Perhaps they should be neutered
    more, like the J. <BR> <BR>The middle stem on the 5 might do better firm than
    droopy. <BR> <BR>The lower half of the 7 calls for something else than the curve
    it is given. <BR> <BR>The foot of the Y should extend across, as JH mentioned.
    <BR> <BR>Maybe the M, N and W could stand a width change, giving them another
    stem widthwise. <BR> <BR>The stem crossing on the X needs a wee bit of work. <BR>
    <BR>Overall, the craft is sound on this one. Nice debut! Looking forward to more.

  body: ' Craig,I actually like the Metro type you started. There is obviously a lot
    of repetative elements which makes it look computer generated, so I would suggest
    a lot of tweaks to each letter to give it a handmade feel, but in all it has some
    direction I like. '

    really graffiti like you would experience <BR>today. i us to write when i was
    a kid, but have never tried to make or design a graffiti fon, and i think you
    have <BR>it cornered both with &#34;Metro and Alpha&#34;! if ya need any help
    let me know. the best way if your having problems would to be draw then out, scan
    them and trace them in Illustrator. then copy and paste into the font <BR>program
    your using. but KEEP IT UP! we need real graffiti fonts from real graffiti artists.
    <BR> <BR>Phil, i like! keep it up also. nice to see fonts that aren&#39;t the
    norm. hope to see more soon! '

    even though it looks like marker. Each character is a symbol making tweaking characters
    in context a lot easier. The plan is to create the basic letterforms and add additional
    swashes that can bolted on. Ill keep working at it!'
