body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nMy first post.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a suitable font for a rock
  band logo. The bands name is Rock Fuel. There music is similar to that of The Hellacopters,
  Backyard Babies and Buck Cherry.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm looking at Wilhelm Klingspor
  Gotisch but I'm starting to think that it might be a little too much. Does anyone
  have any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nI'm limited to Adobes open type library.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPeter"

  body: "Are you trying to stay within the black text theme? I think Wilhelm Klingspor
    Gotisch could work although I'd like to see some customization of the decorative
    details. Possibly incorporate a sans for 'Fuel' to make it a bit more contemporary.\r\n\r\nJust
    please don't set it in all caps."

    body: "It will probably be black, yes. Possibly a dark color. If I use Wilhelm
      Klingspor Gotisch I'm not going to have any caps at all. To put Fuel in a sans
      sounds interesting, I have to try that.\r\n\r\nOther then that I was considering
      making some sort of emblem between rock and fuel, Right now I'm thinking a guitar
      pick with some details that goes together with the decorative details on the
      font. Then maybe putting some small detail in color on the pick.\r\n\r\nI've
      drawn a pick in illustrator with round edges and I think it fits quite well
      together with Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch."

    body: "A blackletter/roman hybrid sounds like something that could work. Fakir
      looks nice too, but I can't pay 79\u20AC for a font, I'm making the logo plus
      a cd cover for the band for free. I have too corporate projects that start in
      april with logo design and webpages, then we can discuss fonts outside Adobes
      opentype library :)"

  body: Think of the 79 euro as an investment in the band. Maybe when they're rich
    and famous they'll make it up to you some how ;-)

    ideas. Maybe something like ITC Kabel? It's pretty sleazy if you tighten up the
    tracking.

  body: "yes it could be an investment, but also if i bought and didn't come up with
    something good with that font I'd be pretty pissed. I'm gonna wait a while before
    I start putting money on typefaces.\r\n\r\nThanks for that site Ben, looks fantastic.
    Tokka quick lok at ITC Kabel.  I tried Avant garde eralier but couldn't come up
    with anything good. I'm just getting started with this logo so anything is possible.\r\n\r\nI'm
    gonna post something when I feel comfotable posting."

  body: btw, if you are going to use FAKIR for more than a line or two, i wouldn't
    reccomend it. it made my eyes hurt. there is too much disorder in this font. i
    think the best wheights for this font are the heavier.
