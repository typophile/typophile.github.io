That's the first time I've been working on making small-caps and I need your experienced advices and eyes.

Today I added the Æ ligature, but the original one for the capitals (the gray one) seemed just odd so I redrew it, that too needs your eyes.

There's the SVG (Inkscape format) for review: http://www.heliosmulti.com/images/dejavu-smallcaps/dejavu-smallcaps-005.svg

The ‘lowercase’ small-caps glyphs are too heavy and too small. They have to be larger than the x-height of the lowercase characters because otherwise they look smaller.

I made the letters a bit higher and lighter. If I compare the old glyphs and the new ones I find them much heavier, not sure the balance is quite right yet but I'm satisfied for today. I need some time away from it to see it with fresh eyes and find the bad stuff.

Changed a lot of stuff that I can't actually all remind. 

Of what is obvious:
<ul>
 <li>added many glyphs to the small-caps set,</li>
 <li>added a first attempt to old-style numerals,</li>
 <li>added a "Th" ligature.</li>
</ul>

Also in the less obvious (but you probably notice it anyway):
<ul>
 <li>tweaked the letters heights on the rounded small-caps letters that seemed to be too low or floating in the air,</li>
 <li>tweaked some shapes so they fit better with the overall color of the typeface.</li>
</ul>

I really wish you would help me, all you experienced type designers. You might not give a damn, but <strong>I do</strong>.

My Inkscape can't open the SVG file. What we need is some context, which we can't get very well from just an alphabet (the PNG file). Can you post a sample text in PDF?

		<div class="commentbody">Looks like it's coming along nicely. I would say that it could be a little lighter still, especially letters with diagonal dark strokes like AMNVWXY.

The E has a couple of problems. Crossbar is too low, and middle serif is too big and bold, I think. Similar problems for F and H. U seems to have a bulgy weight at 7:00. OSF's 5 seems to have too wide a bottom.

I'm not sure if I have a good general reference for making small caps, but Nick Shinn's <a href="http://www.shinntype.com/Richler/Richler_Specimen.pdf">Richler</a> sample is one good example from a highly technically competent designer.

Are you using the current 0.44 version of Inkscape with the DejaVu Serif installed? I'm sorry for having only provided a SVG, so here's the PDF: http://www.heliosmulti.com/images/dejavu-smallcaps/dejavu-smallcaps-009.pdf

I wish I could provide a sample yet, but I haven't imported the glyphs into the font yet, but will do so soon (I don't have the FontForge source file yet).

		<div class="commentbody">sgh, that's a good idea. In this version I got rid of it, and I think it reads better too.

In this version I tweaked almost all the characters of the small-caps. I also redrew the OSD 1 because it was <em>way</em> too similar to the l.sc, and the caps 1 too, which annoyed me. I couldn't find this kind of line anythere else in the font, and I think this one fits better with the overall "theme".

<cite>How do I do that? I must have missed something along the way.</cite>

DejaVu is one of the few Open Source fonts available right now. I'm extending its features with a few things, but the capitals and the lowercase are not my work. <em>DejaVu is a fork of Vera, a font Bitstream released for free to the Gnome Desktop community. The font is available here: http://dejavu.sourceforge.net</em>

I agree with what you say, I'd change more than that personally, but I'm not the only one in this; I'll propose some changes later but right now my focus is making small-caps and old-style figures fit with the rest of the font.</div>

I finally started porting the glyphs to the font.

Here's the file:
http://www.heliosmulti.com/images/dejavu-smallcaps/djvus-sc-011.zip

Unfortunately no preview file yet.


-------------------------------------------
From the Readme:
First release as a font file. First revision of the left and right bearings (on all characters).

Changes:
- Old-style figures
- The complete Basic Latin letterset -- except @, %, $
- From the Latin-1 supplement: 
   -- all variants of "A"
   -- "AE" ligature
   -- Ccedilla
   -- Eth
   -- Oslash
   -- Thorn
- From Latin Extended-A: "OE" ligature.
- Modified Basic "o" width and bearings.


To Do:
- Drawings for a few characters to complete coverage of Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement and Latin Extended-A:
   -- Eng
   -- Yen // NO OFFICIAL MAP
   -- Pound // NO OFFICIAL MAP
   -- Cent old-style
   -- Percent
   -- At @
   -- Dollar old-style
   -- Dollar small (same as Dollar old-style?)
- Composition of basic letters with accents to complete coverage of Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement and Latin Extended-A.</div>

and SVG:

I think there's still some tweaking on the proportions for the lining small figures but the basic drawing probably won't change. Still have the bold version to do. So far pretty satisfied. :)</div>
