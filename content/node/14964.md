  body: "I am trying to find suitable samples regarding 1950s advertising typography.
    From what I recall seeing in books about that design period is common usage of
    sans serifs Futura, Helvetica, Univers and frequent use of Moderns such as Bodoni,
    Poster or Ultra Bodoni, <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?60V\">Craw Modern</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?66N\">Torino</a>, and slab serif/Egyptian
    variants like Craw Clarendon and Melior.\r\n\r\nTwo giants of the period were
    <a href=\"http://ndm.si.edu/dfl/daily/mademoiselle.htm\">Bradbury Thompson</a>
    and Paul Rand. Here's a site that thumbnails samples along a <a href=\"http://www.101010.it/storiagrafica/1950.html\">timeline
    from 1950 -- 1998</a>. I'm sure there are better samples out there.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would remove Helvetica from Norbert's list (released the late fifties, but
    didn't become common until the sixites). I would add Venus (especially Venus Extended),
    News Gothic/Trade Gothic, Alternate Gothic, Century Schoolbook, Century Expanded,
    Baskerville, Caslon 540, Stymie, Futura Display, Bauer Topic, Onyx, Brush Script,
    Latin, Playbill, Balloon, Flash Script... and it was very common for ads to have
    hand-lettered headlines--I would say even the majority. There are some fonts around
    that simulate some of the lettering styles used then. I would suggest the book
    All American Ads of the '50s (Taschen) to get a better idea what to look for.

    to divide \"American advertising\" of the mid-nineteen-fifties, you would have
    <em>high design</em> style such as Bradbury Thompson, a huge <em>mid-range</em>
    and off course, <em>schlock</em>.\r\n\r\nHandlettering was prevalent in use before
    the 50s because offset photo-lithography became the common and inexpensive means
    of printing and therefore affordable to most advertisers. By 1955, New York City
    became the mecca of lettering artists with an estimated 300 professionals employed.

    target=\"new\">(Please read Peter Bain's great article on phototype.)</a>\r\n\r\nPhotolettering,
    Inc. (PLINC) in New York, was quickly building one of the largest libraries of
    phototype, with a stable of fledgling and veteran lettering artist such as Vinny
    Pacella, Vic Caruso and Ephram Benguiat.\r\n\r\nBeautiful scripts and brush lettering
    abounded, and a popular treatment during the 50s was \"Frisky\" headlines (<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=frisky\">bouncing and rotated
    baselines)</a>.\r\n\r\nAlso, after Sputnik, the \"Space Age\" style became popular
    as well.\r\nBelieve it or not, Myfonts.com has a category of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/keyword/1950s/\">1950s

    ads from LIFE, LOOK and other magazines from that period (1946-59), I noted this
    very fact. Almost none of the larger color ads used type for headlines. The lettering
    artists apparently had tons of work, since every car, orange juice, diamond, washing
    machine, brandy, and shoe had not only the unctuous body copy but an accompanying
    headline, sometimes lettered in a refined display version of the text face. There
    are some wonderful, slightly loose hand-lettered versions of grotesk sans and
    modern romans in those headlines. The best source for those same styles now would
    be PLINC, or House Industries, the library's guardians. Perhaps they would set
    a headline for you, or maybe they could hand-letter it. John Downer is also versed
    in several of those advertising styles. He does hand-lettering. \r\n\r\n> TRUMPETS
    < Please support your local hand-lettering artist! \r\n\r\nIt's interesting to
    realize that at that time, graphic artists were clearly able to discern the issues
    separating display and text sizes of type. Not much is left of that awareness
    now. "

    even sign \"painters\" basically use digital plotters nowadays. And many of the

    I truly hope to expand raises the current concern regarding <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14662\">display

    to the differences.\r\n\r\nThe Typophile Forum is undoubtably well frequented

    web site:\r\n\r\n<strong>Lettering vs. Type Design</strong>\r\n\r\n\"Lettering
    is, in many ways, the opposite of type design. Whereas type design creates letters
    that must function under the broadest possible circumstance, lettering is created
    for the most narrow of applications. A word or phrase, be it a logo or a book
    jacket, is custom tailored to work in that environment alone. Every letter drawn
    to fit perfectly within it\u2019s own small world. Even lettering that at first
    looks like typography, has been custom tailored letter-by-letter, and space by-space
    to work perfectly.\"\r\n"

    feel this helps the novice designer to grasp the <em>difference</em> between designing
    (or selecting) a typeface for broad text applications and the approach one should
    consider when designing a logo, masthead or book cover. It is not an answer, but
    an attempt to bring about awareness. \r\n\r\nThough this topic is basically about
    advertising faces of the 1950s, I  believe Mark and Carl wanted to point out these
    major distinctions.\r\n\r\nEven when I was at Agfa-Compugraphic during the 1980s
    many of the designs were still offered as text, text/display and display (T, T/D,
    D).\r\n\r\nCarl Crossgrove's suggestion to show samples could also help in detailing
    differences between display, text and lettered designs prior  to digital fonts.
    Whether that should be added to this thread or a new one is strictly up to Carl's
    intent.\r\n\r\n"

    they are more at \"opposite\" ends of the spectrum, but not in opposition to each
