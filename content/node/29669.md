  body: "\"(3) The Half-Uncial, a combination of uncial and minuscule letters. The
    letters E, V, H retain the uncial form; the D has sometimes the uncial form, sometimes
    the minuscule; the N is in capital. Characteristic letters are:  (respectively,
    a, g, r). The most ancient specimen is the Verona palimpsest, written in 486,
    containing the consular annals from 439 to 486.\"\r\n\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11403a.htm\">Catholic

  body: "Stephen, Tiffany.\r\n\r\nThanks both for your help,\r\nI did'nt seem to be
    able to conect back to typophiles,\r\nto answer Stephen's question or check the
    post.\r\n\r\nTiffany's answer is great, \r\nto put in my own words,\r\nhalf-uncial
    or semi-uncial is the informal evolution of Uncial letterforms,\r\nwhere we start
    to appreciate (and need) the descenders and ascenders,\r\nthat will later become
    our minuscules or lower-case....\r\n\r\nFrom the fonts suggested,\r\ni think Libra
    is probably the most near to real,\r\nbut not so...\r\n\r\nAnyhow, thanks indeed
    for your help"
