  body: The typeface is from the Art Nouveau era, and its real name is &#34;Columbus&#34;.  It
    was an American Type Founders design. David Nalle of Scriptorium has revived it
    under the name of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/beaumarchais/"
    target="_blank">Beaumarchais</a>.
