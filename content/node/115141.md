  originally published in 1930 as  La rebeli\xF3n de las masas. I don't know when
  this cover was designed, other than it seems to have beeen some time between the
  1930s and the 1980s. \r\nLooks sort of familiar but I can't place it. \r\nAny suggestions?
  Thanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aufstand_5800.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: "Many thanks Renko. These letters seem so distinctive, and given the lack
    of response from our ace font detectives, seem to not exist as a digital font.
    I am tempted to make a font based on this limited set of letters and any hints
    I can get. Your suggestion of Renner's Futura Black of 1929 and Woolley's Braggadocio
    of 1930 as possible inspirations for this design is very helpful. The G in Braggadocio
    is really close, but other letters have a very different treatment. \r\nI wonder
    what else might exist?\r\nDon"

  body: Futura Black is very close and like you Don I may make a set of caps from
    this inspiration. Cool Book design.

  body: "Hi Bob, indeed it is a cool book design. I suspect this might have been a
    creation made by manipulating Futura during the photolettering era. The basic
    letter proportions are close to Futura. The letters might not have made it into
    any of the specimen books. If I understand correctly, a lot of this stuff was
    churned out as custom work for individual buyers, like book companies.\r\nDon"
