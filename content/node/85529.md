  font for my native Javanese script recently added to Unicode. The script is a complex
  Indic-type script.\r\nMy font was autohinted in FontForge using steps explained
  [[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/fontforge/wiki/FontForge%27s%20TTF%20hinting%3A%20how%20it%20works|in
  here]].\r\nWith FontForge's autohinting, my font looks decent and readable on-screen.
  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the font looks very distorted on Adobe Reader. I've noticed
  the distortion only happened to my font. Other fonts used in the PDF document look
  fine.\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/SampleAdobeReader.png\">\r\n\r\nStrangely,
  it looks not distorted on Foxit Reader.\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/SampleFoxitReader.png\">\r\n\r\nPlease
  help me how to properly autohint in FontForge so the result will not looks distorted
  on Adobe Reader. Thanks."

    you say \"With FontForge's autohinting, my font looks decent and readable on-screen.\"
    what \"on screen\" environment(s) are you testing? What version(s) of Windows
    and what applications? Is ClearType on at the system level?"
