  from a magazine masthead, I have no other letters.\r\nThe magazine has been around
  since 1987, but I don't know if the masthead has been set in that face since then
  or if it has been redesigned later. It has been set in that face surely since 2002
  till present.\r\nThe similar I found is Rhode Black Condensed, which actually isn't.\r\nI
  know it could be a custom design.\r\nAny hint is welcome, no need to tell you."
