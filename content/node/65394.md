  regarding the development of my display font (or 'Elementary', as a working title),
  please find most up to date visual attached for some ever-constructive feedback/comments.\r\n\r\nAfter
  going around in circles, I've opted to keep the 'bulletholes', but as you'll see
  they're now hopefully counter-balanced with the addition of heavy strokes and filled-in
  counters. Also, I strongly feel this adds more impact to the typeface compared with
  previously, especially when viewed from a distance. As this is still primarily intended
  for headline usage and due to the embellishments, it felt like natural progression
  to keep this in caps.\r\n\r\nI consider this to be still in relatively early stages,
  but Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nGraeme[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elementary_font_08_5377.jpg]"

  body: "Interesting! The bar of the <em>A</em> look's a little awkward, perhaps the
    bottom of <em>D</em> also. I think the transitions to the balls could do with
    smoothing out in general, the ball of the<em>M</em> looks awkward too. Hard to
    assess it conventionally because it's crazy, very interesting concept though.
    Can you set some complete words, I'm curious to see how the black letters work
    within words?\r\n\r\nCheers, thanks for showing.\r\n\r\nAndrew"
