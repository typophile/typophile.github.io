body: "o.k. so i want to make some personal t-shirts and am wondering what are some
  cost effective ways to do it and interesting techniques. Any ideas? (It might be
  easy to make the film positive myself but i would probably go to a shop to do the
  rest. Also any other specialty techniques like flock or puff printing that i should
  know of?)\r\n\r\nI don't like most of the standard t-shirt materials or the way
  they are printed for like sports teams and stuff. I love the thick tinted OBEY t-shirts.
  I am also looking for different types of inks or coats or whatever to give the shirts
  a high quality look.\r\n\r\nAlso I know most of the cost in printing t's is the
  setup. So if i can prepare anything for the setup to reduce costs that would be
  sweet. The shirts i want are probably going to be 1-colour so its easier.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-jesse"

  body: Flock seems like a good solution if you like puffy prints & are only planning
    on using one colour prints. It's probably less expensive than screenprinting as
    well.

  body: if you just want a few tshirts of the same design (say less than 5), flock-printing
    would be your favorite way. if you want to make more than 10-15, screenprinting
    starts to make more sense.

  body: "Generally, the major portion of the cost of producing silkscreened apparel
    is not the setup, but the apparel itself, and perhaps even more so in your case,
    since you expressed a preference for a more \"upscale\" substrate. For personal-use
    projects, you will probably be best off contacting local apparel silkcreeners,
    and comparing costs. If you want to get into the business of producing screend
    apparel, you would probably be best served by having your designs printed first
    on thermal transfer paper, then applied via heat press to the garments. The advantages
    to this method are (1) less upfront cost (the paper is MUCH cheaper than the garments);
    (2) virtually no spoilage (unless the heat press operator is a total dunce); and
    (3) little or no \"dead\" inventory (if certain designs do not sell well, you
    are not stuck with imprinted garments you will most likely have to sell at a loss).\r\n"

    a few years old.  If you scroll to the far right side of the top photo, you'll
    see the placement of the type.\r\n\r\nEverything's silkscreened.  Friend of mine
    did the front as a limited edition (75, I've got #1 hanging in my dining room)
    linoblock print entitled \"Light Lunch,\" and sent me an artist proof that I took
    over to the company.\r\n\r\nThey did a high-end scan of the print and reversed
    the colours (in the print, that big expanse of open shirt above the glass is actually
    ink), and my Illustrator file of the type, and within a week, I had a monster
    box of these.  Extra charge for XL and XXL, of course, but still pretty reasonable.\r\n\r\nHere's

    a screen printing shop up in the San Francisco area. He is currently putting some
    information together for me on blank shirts. I'll gladly share the information
    he passes on.\r\n\r\nFor now here is my take on American Apparel:\r\n\r\nAmerican
    Apparel seem to have replaced Hane's Beefy T's as the blank t-shirt of choice
    for many bands and hip t-shirt designers over the past few years.\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I have to give them really mixed reviews. They are probably the most comfortable
    t-shirts I have ever worn. Initially AA shirts fit nicely and are really soft.
    However after just a few washes they tend to shrink up pretty severely. Also,
    that nice, thin material does not seem to hold up as long as other t-shirts I
    have.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could work out some sort of t-shirt trade once some of
    us have them made...?\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    experience mirrors mine with the AA shirt: the shrinkage was particularly noticeable
    with mine on the shoulder seam, where the inside tape shrank massively and the
    shirt itself didn't.  Not a pretty sight.\r\n\r\nLinda"
