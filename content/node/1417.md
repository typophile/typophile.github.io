  body: I don&#39;t think Benguiat is that ugly, but I&#39;m sick of seeing it. It&#39;s
    everywhere, at least here in Rio!

  body: Adriano, Its funny none of the ITC faces are super popular in New York right
    now. I think its a reaction to the gigantic x height. Older styles with smaller
    x heights and more leading seems to be in vogue.

  body: Actually, the most popular version of Benguiat here is the Bitstream one,
    because it comes with &#40;argh, knock on wood 3 times&#41; CorelDraw. <BR> <BR>Just
    the other day I was riding the bus home and couldn&#39;t help but notice that
    whoever did the &#39;identity&#39; for the bus company used CorelDraw &#40;and
    didn&#39;t have a clue about proper use of  type&#41;. There was AvantGarde with
    fake smallcaps, there was Kabel BT, there was Benguiat and Benguiat Gothic...

  body: Adriano, I feel your pain. Benquiat was bad enough but there is no excuse
    for Benguiat Gothic and Avant Garde with fake smallcaps &#40;I think I&#39;m feeling
    faint&#41;. Roger I will scan something and post it soon.

    a picture of it to show you guys. It was sooo ugly.
