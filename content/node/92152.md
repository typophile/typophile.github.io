  I'm noticing that sometimes when I find a great font that seems to suit the feeling
  I want, the numerals aren't living up to the greatness of the letters. I'd love
  some recos for typefaces whose numerals are truly inspired. Has anyone come across
  any awesome, interesting numbers lately? Look forward to some suggestions... thanks!\r\n\r\nEvan"
