body: So this is the logotype for my soon to come personal page The idea behind it
  is, to go with the name, one line, continuous, no stroke variation. I&#39;m not
  happy at all with the &#34;e&#34;, any criticisms will be most welcome! <BR><IMG

    a logo &#40;rejected&#41; that i did for an airline fulfillment company. i still

  body: ' the bjork font has definitely been an inspiration, hope i haven&#39;t taken
    &#34;too much&#34; inspiration. Hoped to make it less of a typeface by using different
    ways of linking letters &#40;o-n/o-l, for example&#41; but i&#39;m thinking of
    developing it into a complementing typeface later on... if i&#39;m up to the challenge.
    <BR> <BR>thanks for the suggestions, looking better <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    Try thinking in those terms and I think you&#39;ll see new ways to make the &#34;o&#34;
