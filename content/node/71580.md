    squeezed. Other than that it's the same\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: Ok, thanks.  Wow, Neutraface is hella expensive.  Are there any free alternatives?  I
    am using this for a personal project, not commercial, so I can't exactly shell
    out for the $250 they are asking for the font.

  body: "It's expensive because it's high quality and there really isn't any other
    design like it, so if you want to use it, you'll have to buy it.\r\n\r\nSimilar
    fonts:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/sans_geometric/ - Not free,
    but you may have one of them already.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/style/Sans%20Serif
    - Check here for good quality free fonts.\r\n\r\nJust off the top of my head,
    I think Kabel and Bernhard Gothic look similar in that they are geometric and
    slightly quirky.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: If you want something low, low quality but with some similar proportions,
    [[http://www.dafont.com/search.php?psize=m&q=market+deco|Market Deco]] & [[http://www.dafont.com/mouse-deco.font|Mouse
    Deco]] are free. You'll have to work hard to correct the bad spacing, and re-draw
    the Z in Market Deco if you use it.

  body: Typophile Sindre Bremnes [[http://www.typophile.com/user/39515|(Satyagraha)]]
    has been working on such a font, called [[http://www.typophile.com/node/66441|Telefon]].
    It hasn't yet been released but it's quite far along, so you may want to contact
    him and ask about its release date and price point.

  body: "Thank you all for your responses, I do appreciate the help greatly.  I have
    been a graphic designer for 5 years, but I've always just chosen a font that looks
    good, without any real thought into the typography process.  Justin, you say those
    fonts are low quality, but I'm afraid I don't understand what a low quality font
    means.  To my eyes, and I could be grossly mistaken, all fonts look the same \"quality\".
    I mean, they don't have aliased edges and what not.  Is it a spacing or kerning
    issue?  What separates a good quality font from a bad quality one?\r\n\r\nAre
    there any resources for learning the basics of typography, and what font choices
    I should be looking for in certain circumstances?  I apologize if I sound like
    a novice, I'm really not.  I'm just more of a visual effects artist, who also
    happens to do a little motion graphics work as well.\r\n\r\nThank you all for
    your incite and suggestions."

  body: "Straight off the bat I'd say that answering what separates good quality from
    bad is the same with everything - you can tell the difference between and cheap
    town car (not naming any names) and a full spec Mercedes right? It's about what
    has gone into something that makes it good quality; Time, effort, research & skill.
    If you're saying you've been a graphic designer for 5 years (and I don't doubt
    that) then you should start seriously looking into the finer points of typography
    - it can only help you and improve your understanding of what works and why people
    are willing to pay the kind of prices you see from these font foundries.\r\n\r\nNeutra
    may seem a little expensive, but considering the different weights you get for
    your money and the fact that you're getting a font that not every spotty young
    wannabee with a few free fonts and a cracked copy of photoshop may have will lift
    your designs above the mediocre. You'll find a lot more mileage from a decent,
    well thought out font than you may realise.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: Interesting points, Jazz.  Almost 100% of my work is for film or TV, so my
    workflow is probably different from many on this forum.  I rarely ever do print
    work.  I will look into some typography books and tutorials. It never hurts to
    have more skills! :)
