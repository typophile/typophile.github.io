  body: I believe it's based on <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=8&displayfontid=ITC.119135.0.0&fontRendererText=Baskin+31+Robbins">ITC
    Garamond Condensed</a>, but appears to be modified somewhat.

  body: "I suspect that, like most logos, this is custom lettering, but you could
    approximate this with Scangraphic's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=SG.102124.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Baskin+Robbins&sampleSize=32\">'Times
    Black'</a> and a bit of 'squooshing'. The x-height is nearly as high, and the
    letterforms are pretty close, in my opinon. The '3' has even the right attributes,
    if you distort it some.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
