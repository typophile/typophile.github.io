body: "Hello.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project and the main font for the logo (company
  name) is hard to pin down. It doesn't work with fonts like Helvetica and nor does
  it work with traditional serif fonts. I'm looking for a modern font that's clean
  but has a bit of flair (hope that makes sense lol). Sorry for being vague, if people
  could post up some suggestions it would really help me out!\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nDave"

    I would say 80% Sans, 20% Serif is the balance. Think Georgia but a bit cleaner.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDave\r\n\r\n"
