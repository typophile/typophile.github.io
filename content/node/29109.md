  body: "SARTRE cover type+\r\nJust a little more info on this face : I believe that
    it comes from a book published by Gallimard in France in or around 2005. The face
    makes me think of Garage gothic, which also has this slightly rounded feel. But
    this particular face is also slightly more angular, for example in the construction
    of the R, or in the S. I've checked the T-26 listing, and there are a couple of
    slightly similar faces by Jim Marcus (Arete Mono and Tempus gothic), but neither
    corresponds exactly.\r\nthanks again,\r\npete\r\n"

  body: "It looks quite a bit like Canada Type's revival of 'Signum' by Georg Trump
    that they call <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/trump-gothic/\">Trump
    Gothic. </a>. Look at the Bold weights set in the letters 'SARTRE'. The A is a
    bit different in width, but the overall appearance is quite similar, I think.\r\n\r\n-
