body: "Greetings all, and thank you for taking the time to review not only my first
  post to these forums but also my first sans/display face.\r\n\r\nSome time ago I
  reproduced a World War I poster reminding Americans that electricity consumes coal.
  It was commissioned by the US Fuel Administration and drawn by Coles Phillips...
  http://garyritchie.com/txp/index.php?id=21\r\n\r\nI drew the remaining capitals
  and numerals taking the best care that I follow the original style. The & looks
  awkward to me and the @ is awful."

  body: "I think that the ampersand is OK. But the numbers don't work. I think that
    you have to completely redo them, even if that means sacrificing historical accuracy.
    Make them feel right, and you'll have a good piece of work.\r\n\r\nCan you make
    a text setting with your letters? Its hard to judge the uppercase letters without
    some sort of combination."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback regarding the numerals, Dan. Historical accuracy
    isn't as important to me as having them look like part of the family. Or, as you
    say, \"feel right.\"\r\n\r\nThis sample is rather embarrassing. It's painfully
    obvious I need to review my kerning table. I had not planned on lowercase characters.\r\n\r\nSample
    attached to first post."

  body: hmm... I didn't find the numerals awful. The "1," "2," and "6" work pretty
    well for me, in fact. The "7" might work better with the lighter vertical and
    heavier horizontal. But I agree about the @ symbol... I'm not sure yet how you
    might fix that one...
