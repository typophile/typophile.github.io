body: "I keep seeing this one in old East German books and cannot find any information
  on it. Similar fonts used in East Germany include \"Fundamental Grotesk\", \"Super
  Grotesk\", and of course \"Futura\" but this one is not like any of those. If a
  digital version can't be found - which is likely - I'd like to at least know its
  name. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nLastly, if you don't know, how would you suggest researching
  an old type like this? Traveling to the printing shop, hoping to get some information?
  Finding experts on old type (does that even exist)? What is a good way to track
  down a forgotten type?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alexanderplatz_6182.jpg]"

    lower case a and e are strong indicators, but other letters are not right like
    the t or M."

  body: It is indeed Gill Sans Infant, also known as Schoolbook, found the alternate
    "t" and "M" and a few other glyphs in an old specimen book from the UK. Will post
    a photo when I can take one  later today. Nick's Examiner is close but the "t"
    is not a square as the one in Gill Sans Schoolbook.

  body: Thanks a lot for your help! Series 262 comes very close (the "b" and "d" are
    minimally different). Does the book list all letters of 262? (The "w"/"W" is definitely
    different in series 362.)

  body: "These are the alternative letters for the font - the rest would be as standard
    in Gill Sans Infant (Schoolbook). The idea of alternative letters was that the
    type setter could make a choice - some digital fonts have alternative sets - as
    far as I know these for Gill Sans never made it to digital versions.\r\n\r\nWhat
    differences you may see in the b and d alternatives are possiblly from printing
    pressure etc. The W alternative was not used in your sample - the regular Gill
    Sans Infant W was."

  body: "I see. Thanks for clarifying.\r\n\r\nActually, after some googling, I came
    across this thread:\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/44358]]\r\n\r\nIt shows
    another German example in use, along with some commentary:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Nick,
    I am sure you know that what you show here is the custom version of Gill Sans
    created for the continental/international market. It is an imitation of Futura
    commented on by Walter Tracy in his Letters of Credit (p. 95). Its alternates
    \u2014 AJMNQRWW and abdgpqstuw (roman), and JMQ and aaefgptu (italic) \u2014 are
    set in a separate line in the \u2018Monotype\u2019 Book of Information. The figures
    look especially unauthentic...</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI don't have these books (unfortunately
    - I guess \"Letters of Credit\" I should have) so I don't have more information
    than this."

  body: "Confirmed, there is such an illustration in \u2018Letters of Credit\u2019.
    Gill Sans Continental is also mentioned and shown in \u2018Buchdruckschriften
    im 20. Jahrhundert\u2019 by Philipp Bertheau and others, Technische Hochschule
    Darmstadt 1995. Funny enough, the \u2018a\u2019 of Gill Continental as shown in
    \u2018Buchdruckschriften\u2019 looks like the infant character (with a tail right
    below), whereas the sample in \u2018Letters of Credit\u2019 shows a sample of
    Gill Continental with a clean \u2018Futura a\u2019. Monotype users could exchange
    matrices (within the same unit range), so it may very well be that not all typesetters
    replaced all matrices and/or mixed up infant and \u2018Futura-like\u2019 variations."
