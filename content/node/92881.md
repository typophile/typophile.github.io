  both the title font and text font in these images. I know the clarity isn't all
  that great for the text font - but the it doesn't have to be 100% exact.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/87b5fd9c68a8c7060dfd8c7789e0f5c2_5007.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a21f8ffdb2648e875c013307ef669a2c_4893.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch
  appreciated! "

  body: "When you say title font do you mean e.g. \"Short Drinks\"?\r\nThis one looks
    like it's not a font but a custom (handwritten)  design - if you look at the same
    letters /o /n /k /s in \"Short Drinks\" and \"Long Drinks\" they are all different.\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of text is so small that I doubt anybody will be able to id the font - even
    approximately.\r\nA close-up photo of a single text paragraph would be much better..."
