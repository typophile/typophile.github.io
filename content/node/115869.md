  is CRM, but this font doesn't seem from the CRM family at all. Image search for
  CRM give the expected CRM-related results. \r\n[[http://www.mygatsby.com/scene7/image/fontstyle/id/1658]]\r\n"

  body: "Most of their fonts are commercial fonts and they did not change the names.
    I was going to suggest [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typadelic/sunnydale/?refby=bowfin|Sunnydale]]
    as a similar font, but I see that is also one of their other fonts at MyGatsby.com.\r\n\r\nI
    could not find this at any freebie sites, which I looked at because the font seemed
    amateurish to me. It's possible it is something they made themselves, as that
    kind of font can be made very cheaply.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    find anything remotely similar anywhere. I would be willing to pay for something
    similar!\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "Thank, you, Mike. They do have elements in common, sure, but Sunnydale seems
    to a lot more casual. CRM has a lot of personality, but it -at the same time-
    neater.  Is interesting that the same prnter has another font that is very reminiscent
    of CRM, which they call painType. Couldn't find that one anywhere either!\r\n[[<https://drive.google.com/#folders/0B46r99jQllAIaVJ2VTBmY24wMlk|crm>>]]"

title: Curly, cute font reminiscent of Janda Quirky Girl w-a hint of Papyrus. Called
  "CRM" but nothing like normal CRM
