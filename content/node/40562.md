body: "Hello everybody!\r\n\r\nI could use some font inspiration, and since I've been
  a ghost reader for some while I thought I'd come out of the closet. I really admire
  how such a great number of users in here can give great advice, so I would be very
  grateful to get the same.\r\n\r\nIn short: I need an awfully sleezy, kitch, ironic
  corporate font. I'm looking for the kind of commercial aesthetic, that just yells:
  \"Save big, buy now, get 2 for the price of one, 100% satisfaction or your money
  back\" etc.\r\n\r\nI doesn't matter if it's a really low quality free ware font.
  In fact, it might help.\r\n\r\nThink about your worst branding nightmare basically...\r\n\r\nAnd
  then why do I why want to do this? I'm working on a graphic project in collaboration
  with a researcher in critical sociological theory, so the theoretical background
  of the project may be a bit to long haired just for now (I'd be happy to talk about
  it though). But in short: the project is about the possibility of critique, or lack
  thereof, in contemporary society.\r\n\r\nSo far, our concept is a fictional corporation
  (no name), that sells \"critique\" in various forms, for example: (1) critical coaches
  or corporate critics, (2) critical cleaning-cans that make all \"bad employee critique\"
  vanish etc.\r\n\r\nMy specific contribution this time will be a number of posters
  over this theme, that should work as our corporation's commercial ads.\r\n\r\nI'm
  not sure if this is good enough information, so please ask me what I mean if it's
  not concrete enough.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMalte"

  body: 'Thanks alot for the suggestions. Most of them were exactly what I was looking
    for. After working a bit more on the project though, I''ve come to decide that
    I wanted a bit more realism. I would be too easy and not dangerous enough to just
    make it ironic. I want to show how our mock-corporation actually could be a future
    possibility. So I ended up using something slightly different: Eurostile LT Std
    Bold Oblique. I found that it suited the job, with its round (cf. the comic fonts),
    yet solid (cf. impact) look.'
