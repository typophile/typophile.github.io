body: "I would like to ask, how much would i charge for designing a book by project
  (not by per hour). Charging by per hour are just minor changes. We cant keep track
  by charging the whole idea and design by per hour nor by per page. The book size
  is 280(h)x280(w)mm and pagination from  200-250pgs with hard cover. \r\n\r\nContent
  for Quotation:\r\n1. Proposal on Concept Approach\r\n2. Consultation on Concept\r\n3.
  Design layout typography\r\n4. Scan, photoshop, Illustrations/tracings graphics,
  search for stock images\r\n5. Content Editing / Proofreading\r\n\r\nPlease do let
  me know if i missed out anything or whats the best idea.\r\nThank you for sharing
  your knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nMartin"
