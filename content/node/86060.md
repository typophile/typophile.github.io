body: "I started work today on a display typeface specifically for use in the titles
  of an animation project I'm involved in. The theme of the animation is changing
  space in architecture, so I'm putting together a very neutral, un-stylized condensed
  face with heavily stylized alternates to sprinkle in.\r\n\r\nThe alternates are,
  admittedly, very crude and blunt, but that's the vibe I'm going for. There's a bit
  of a play on words in the name Antechamber, which usually refers to a smaller space
  leading into a larger one, but in this case can also be interpreted phonetically
  as \"anti chamber\", meaning the inversion of a region of space within each glyph
  (hence the blunt, solid fills in the alternates).\r\n\r\nSince its only intended
  purpose is the titling within this animation, I'm pushing the alternate gimmick
  pretty hard, which I admit. I want to make sure, however, that the underlying face,
  while perhaps a bit generic, is still typographically sound.\r\n\r\nWhat you see
  here is just a couple hours from start to finish in a single sitting, so while I
  think it's in a clean, visible state, it's virtually devoid of refinement and really
  just represents a first draft. I like the quirkiness of it, though, so I'm very
  open to first impressions either way. I'd love specific feedback on color consistency
  from glyph to glyph, the cleanliness of the curves, and all the usual mechanics.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: My critical eye is drawn most to the N. The diagonal stroke is too thin. I
    would consider making its slope less steep, meeting at corners that are not so
    wide on the outside, since the filled-in version naturally exaggerates that measurement
    along the top of the corner.
