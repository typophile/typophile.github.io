  improvement, but how will it play on <EM>mane</EM> street, and will it help them
  win? \r\n\r\nMaybe they traded that old circus font to the Cowboys along with Kitna. "

  body: So rather than improve the players they are playing with the logo. That should
    move them up in the standings ... maybe as high as second worst team in the league.

    This may seem like a fanboy speaking, but the best \"update\" to a team's logo/mascot
    was done by the Seattle Seahawks. They are one of the few teams to go from boring
    --> cool. But a lot of team's old logos and uniforms were way cooler back in the
    day.\r\n\r\nThe days when teams wear their throwback uniforms are the best. The
    Cowboys' and Lion's throwbacks are especially improvements over their drab current
    uniforms.\r\n\r\nAnd Don is right: Spend some money fixing your team and someone
    might actually care if your logo has changed."

    a few months ago. http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/104800/3251978803_cc80d945ac_o.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm
    glad they just added details to the classic silhouette. The type looks furry,
    which is cute, I'm not sure it's succeeds in being \"aggressive\" but at least
    it doesn't look like it's from the back part of Cedar Point anymore. In general
    the aesthetics of football has been a race to the bottom. The best thing we can
    hope for here is that the Lions use this logo update as an excuse to ditch the
    horrible black they added to the uniforms and go back to the awesome bright blue
    and silver everyone identifies them with. "

    with Matt Mullen, and that includes the black unis. They will instead use their
    classic blue and silver throwbacks as their third uniform.\r\n\r\nAnd the woodtype
    of their name will be missed. Not too many people or companies had kept such a
    thing for so long."

    the stink of 0-16.
