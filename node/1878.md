body: I have seen this font in a variety of books, the oldest one being printed in
  1950. <BR>It is used frequently as display/titling, but sometime for main text.
  <BR> <BR>I havent&#39;t found a digital correspondent. The closest one is Erasmus
  RR. <BR> <BR>Can you help me ?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19513.jpg"

  body: I must disagree with William&#39;s post about this typeface being Meidoorn.  This
    scan of the font from the Jaspert &#39;Encyclopaedia of Type Faces&#39;  shows
    some clear differences, especially in the R. This request was posted on the comp.fonts
    newsgroup a couple of days ago, and I replied with the suggestion of <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=RR00005001P2"
    target="_blank">Erasmus</a> and <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=203122"
    target="_blank">Hollandse Medieval</a>, as similar typefaces that I knew were
    available in digital form.  It seems clear that if that Mircea&#39;s sample is
    not by DeRoos, then it was inspired by his work.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19610.gif"

  body: 'Mike, you&#39;re right, the R is different. My mistake. I was also looking
    at &#40;another edition of&#41; Jaspert, but not carefully enough.  <BR> <BR>The
    sample also does not exactly match either Erasmus or Hollandse Medieval in Jaspert.
    Perhaps if there is a book of De Roos&#39; types the mystery could be solved. '

  body: Thank you all for your suggestions.  <BR>Until now, the closest one is Meidoorn,
    which I looked over on the net to find samples but no succes. Thankfully to Mike
    Yanega post, now I saw it. <BR> <BR>I also have some bold samples of the mistery
    font, which I will scan and post middle of next week. <BR> <BR>Info about de Roos
    fonts can be found at <a href="http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/RoosDe/SdeRoos.pdf"

    <BR> <BR>Proceeding by elimination, there are not much fonts left to try... if
    it&#39;s a de Roos font.

  body: Mircea,  <BR> <BR>Is the language Romanian?  You said the oldest sample you
    saw was from the 1950&#39;s. What was the most recent use of it you have seen?
    <BR> <BR>The typeface &#40;I wont say font, because to most of us that means a
    digital typeface&#41; has some interesting features, and particularly the &#39;g&#39;
    &#40;which again looks a lot like Hollandse Medieval&#41;. Either you have two
    different fonts here, or the heavier weight uses a different &#39;g&#39;, and
    now with the lower case we can see that it uses a Venetian, or Old Style &#39;e&#39;
    , and has an &#39;i&#39; with an unusual dot. I notice some inconsistencies with
    your first sample and some of these new ones &#40;look at the E&#41;, which makes
    me think we may have several fonts here. It&#39;s things like this that make me
    wish I had old catalogs from other European foundries, instead of mostly American,
    German and English typefaces. Yves, how&#39;s your print resources &amp; references?

  body: It seems very much like a design from the early 1890s to early 1920s, before
    the geometrics and art deco got big. Kind of like something Herman Ihlenburg might
    have done.

  body: Yes, the language is Romanian. <BR> <BR>The oldest book in which this typeface
    appears is from 1950, a math book from which I extracted the last three samples.
    From these you can see that the bold face is used together with the regular. The
    inconsistencies are important, but some features like the shape of the dot on
    i are also consistent. Considering that the bold is very heavy, almost black,
    and not all features can be keeped at this weight, it is possible to be in the
    same family with the regular. <BR> <BR>The most recent book which uses this face
    is from 1991, but it is clear that is printed with the old technology.

    very impressive I&#39;m afraid. There&#39;s a couple of ID&#39;ers on this  <BR>board
    with mind-boggling collections of old type compendiums,  <BR>but I mostly rely
    on Rookledge&#39;s, recent catalogues of digital type  <BR>and online research.

    of old typefaces, and they've broadened the range of the family to be a more complete
    rendition of the original design, which also had italics and condensed weights.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    this is still not the same as the posted sample, remember, so this mystery has
