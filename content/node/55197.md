  client likes the initial concept, i am now designing variations around the idea.\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance for your input.\r\n\r\n:tony[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dine_5754.jpg]"

- body: "First, it's a very cool concept, and I think the diner/neon feel is perfect
    for this concept. Nice work so far!\r\n\r\nSecond, I think there's a weight problem.
    The width of the e-fork is much broader than the other letters. Have you tried
    drawing the D and the N with more overall width to unify the letters more? I think
    doing that may help the e-fork feel less cluttered or \"tacked on\" (and, bonus,
    it will give you more room to enlarge DOWNTOWN so it's more legible when scaled
    down.) \r\n\r\nThis may also enable you to comfortably reduce the stroke weight
    of DIN to match the e-fork, too. I'd also smooth the inner joint of the fork handle
    to match the rest of your curved corners.\r\n\r\nAK"

  body: "This is a good concept. I'd make the handle of the fork monoline rather than
    using two lines to define it, and not let it touch the 'n'. Widen D and N, and
    lose the gap in the 'D', which distracts the eye from the fork.\r\n\r\nGood luck"
