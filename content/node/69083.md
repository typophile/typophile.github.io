body: "The \"font-variant: small-caps\" property doesn't actually map to the small
  caps, instead the browser scales the uppercase. The obvious solution for web fonts
  is keeping the small caps in a separate font file (sc instead of the lc). This causes
  a problem: someone using a browser that doesn't support @font-face will see lowercase
  characters where you intended uppercase characters. How would you solve it?\r\n\r\nAnother
  issue: I'm thinking about building a font with a set of ornaments for a web site
  project. A less updated user might end up with a system font instead, leaving the
  ornaments useless. One option might be using Wingdings or Webdings as fallbacks,
  but that restricts me to their character set. I'm not really sure how \"web safe\"
  those are anyway. Do I have other options? "

    glyphs in both uppercase and lowercase positions. \r\n\r\nAlso, please note that
    the [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/#small-caps|CSS3 Fonts proposal]] introduces
    the <code>font-variant-caps: small-caps</code> and <code>font-variant-caps: all-small-caps</code>
    properties to access OpenType Layout smallcaps, and also modifies the description
    of <code>font-variant: small-caps</code> to try OpenType Layout smallcaps first,
    and only apply uppercase downscaling as a fallback. Of course, it will take considerable
    time before this gets introduced. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    the other hand, the entire Zapf Dingbats set <em>has</em> been mapped into UC,

    things that look exactly alike, appear in Arial Unicode MS from position U+2701

  body: "<quote>Adam: <em>..There are no Unicode small caps ..</em></quote>\r\n\r\nFrode:
    FYI, there <em>are</em> a number of small caps characters defined in Unicode,
    but these describe the form, rather than the function. The <em>function</em> is
    for phonetic transliteration of certain speech forms, and these are not to be
    confused with \"regular characters in a small caps form\".\r\n\r\nUnicode does
    not define any font appearance at all -- italics, bold, underline, outline, and
    so on.\r\nIt has the advantage that this, combined with a Small Caps <em>feature</em>,
    will copy a small caps text from a PDF in its original 'lowercase' form. If the
    font has a c2sc (Caps to Small Caps) feature, the original case of the text will
    be preserved."

  body: "@frode\r\n\r\nYou've brought up an interesting problem that calls for an
    interrim solution because - as Adam observed - it's going to be a good long while
    before the specs and browser implementations make it clear how to handle small-caps.\r\nAs
    you said, right now, most browsers deal with it by synthesizing small-caps.\r\nI
    haven't looked into solutions to this problem but I did read somewhere that wherever
    font-variant small-caps is used, text-decoration:uppercase should also be specified.\r\nIf
    I can remember the page where that advice was dispensed, I'll come back with the
    link.\r\nI believe the point of doing that is to, at least, force uppercase in
    those browsers that don't synthesize. I haven't checked out the wisdom of that
    advice, I'm just passing it along - FWIW.\r\nFor now, it's certainly clear that
    using a separate small-caps font is a necessity.\r\nThat much is clear.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nRich"

    (that is, including IE6) with CSS was to set text-transform:uppercase and font-size:80%
    (or whatever percentage seems fit).
