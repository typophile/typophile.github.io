body: "Alrighty, I am wondering if there is word-processing software that allow this
  functionality, and what operating system it runs on.\r\n\r\nSuppose a company has
  custom stationery.  They simply type up their documents in a word processor and
  print it on their paper and it's done.  Branding applied!\r\n\r\nBut, if they were
  to try to save their file digitally for an email attachment or a PDF, the file would
  not have the branding of the letterhead because the page would be blank.\r\n\r\nIs
  there software besides indesign (I want consumer level word processing software)
  that has the functionality to have a template with branding that would be visible
  digitally in that file, or an exported format like PDF, but would be a no-print
  layer automatically?"

    In fact it's a bit like wrestling a moose. You just have to trick yourself into
    believing you won. Ah wait I see a fly in the ointment - to have it not print
    automatically? That's a problem. \r\n\r\nHow about make two templates? One for
    printing on pre-printed material and the other template for other uses?"

  body: The purpose of having the visible but non-print template is to avoid having
    to create 2 parallel documents with (hopefully) the same content as the revisions
    happen, so you only have to maintain one document for both screen and print purposes.
