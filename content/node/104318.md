  a while back in mspaint on another computer.  I really like the font. It has nicely
  shaped 'O'  the arrows on the 'S', the lanting 't', the roman style 'V'.  Here it
  is below:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/What is this muvverfonting
  font_5209.jpg]\r\n\r\nI now need a banner printed and there is a special offer on
  right now , but the jpeg I made is way too small so I need to redo it as a vector.
  However I can't find the font.  I've tried the online image font search tools and
  even went through about 100 questions on one site trying to narrow it down. \r\n\r\nMaximum
  kudos for he/she who finds it first ! =)\r\n\r\nHoping you can help. regards,\r\n\r\nDavid"
