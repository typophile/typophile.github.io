  base font has probably been modified slightely (The first 'L' for example), but
  it would be a good start to name that font !\r\n\r\nIt looks like a [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-zapf-chancery/medium-italic/|Zapf
  Chancery]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/lucida-cal-t/italic/|Lucida Calligraphy]]
  or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/monotype-corsiva/monotype-corsiva/|Monotype
  Corsiva]] style, but some letters are strangely straight, like the 'q'. \r\n\r\nI'm
  quite lost here, thanks for the help !"
