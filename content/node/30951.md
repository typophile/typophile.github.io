  logo. I think it might be URW++ Friz Quadrata No. 2 but I don't want to buy it until
  I'm sure. If anyone could somehow verify this or correct me, I would be grateful.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  do you have any advice on what to do in situations like this, where a close match
  is known but not an exact one?"

  body: There is no sure-fire way to get an exact match, but FontShop's giant sampler
    can help. I think <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.115643.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=RICE&sampleSize=144">URW's
    Friz Quadrata No. 2</a> is indeed closest, with a slight mod to the end of the
    'E's crossbar.
