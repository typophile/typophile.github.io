I need to get my hands on a nice serif – a fairly traditional one preferably – with 'reading' a's and g's. This is intended for body text in a novel-style text, so shouldn't really be so markedly different in any other way from what you might normally find. A lot of nice serif fonts have suitable italics, but the Roman or book styles have the arc overhead (although I don't know what that's called).

Thanks for your time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Can I inquire as to *why* you want that style? Departing from "normal" letterforms for the body text of a novel will be jarring to the reader.

Moreover, those letter forms as alternates in serif typefaces were not adopted for reading purposes, but for teaching young children to *write*. All the available evidence is that they are in fact less legible. Plenty of publishers and designers are confused about this, but that doesn't make them right.

I believe there are several OpenType faces released recently which offer the single-bowl a and g not as default, but as an alternate in a Stylistic Set. Off the top of my head, I can only think of sans serif faces. Actually, there was a thread here about this, earlier in the year.</div>

Can you cite scientific studies that support this? I have often wondered this myself but have yet to come across any. Instincts tell me they would make no significant difference to performance measures such as reading time and comprehension.</div>

If reading research can show that certain typographic details, let's use ligatures as an example, make no significant difference <strong>in contexts where comprehension is of primary importance</strong>, then the typographer need not concern themselves with them saving valuable resources such as time and money that could be better spent on installing solar panels.

Why is reading research not a good basis for typographic decision making, and what would you propose as an alternative?</div>

There we disagree. Now, aesthetics are hard to measure, so there are plenty of distinctions that are not easily made in research that still really do matter to art (or even craft). But anything that reading research tells us <strong>does</strong> matter, we should probably be paying close attention to.

Ligatures is an interesting example. Today, people using professional typesetting tools have to go out of their way to turn ligatures off. Yet this is commonly (though not universally) done in children's books. It would be very interesting to see some research on whether children find ligatures confusing, and at what ages or stages of learning to read. As far as I know there has been no research on the subject. I mentioned this briefly in my talk at TypeCon.

Which particular font did you have in mind?
Serif or sans?
What size?
What weight?
What page layout?
Pixel or print?
What stock/screen resolution?
What demographic of readers? 
What reading environment? (RSVP in a lab?)
What text?
What publication?
What intended reading outcome?
What language?
And finally, who is the typographer?

Reading research is able to draw conclusions from a specific experiment in which the above variables are fixed, but generalizing to situations where the variables are otherwise is shooting in the dark.

Typography is a discipline of infinite variety, to be practised with taste and discretion, not reduced to a set of idiot rules.

You are speaking of the pros and cons of experimental designs that have either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_validity">internal validity</a> or <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity">external validity</a>. While highly controlled laboratory environments may not be an accurate representation of real-world situations, it is only through highly controlled conditions that one can determine what variable is influencing what measure with any confidence. The cumulation of several studies with a high degree of internal validity slowly allows us to draw broader generalizations to the real world. With sound reasoning and reproducible results we can solve problems with greater efficiency ensuring clients a secure return on investment.

You raised the example of ligatures.
I showed three sans serif 'fi's of quite different construction.
Unless you test all three against "ligatures off", how can you be sure of any conclusion about the readability of ligatures in general?
And what of other ligatures and other sans typefaces, and what of ligatures in serifed types?
