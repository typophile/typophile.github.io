  sale: 373 fonts in eleven type cabinets, plus 129 related items. \r\n\r\nThe collection
  is about one-third historic and fancy fonts, one-third modern 20th century fonts,
  and one-third gothics. Also included are two smaller collections, one of borders,
  catchwords & ornaments and one of sorts, as well as several wood type catalogs and
  books and a 36-inch wood type composing stick from the old print shop at St. Meinrad's
  Abbey Press. \r\n\r\nFor an inventory and prospectus with additional photos, please
  email me at <strong>   malcolmdean@mac.com </strong>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClarendonXXXCc_4307.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TuscanExtended72_6096.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PaintersRoman72_6469.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArcadianNo172_5521.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TuscanCd72_6059.jpg]\r\n\r\n\"In
  closing, I'd like to recount an interesting incident which adds another dimension
  to the allure of wood type\u2026 a mother and child incident [at an antiques mall
  not long ago]. The boy, about 11 years old, was unhappy with the mall experience;
  but his eyes lit up on spotting [our] array of type cases holding type, cuts and
  other seductive what nots. After inspecting things for a while, he started on a
  second tour despite his mother's tuggings. The mother persisted, the boy resisted.
  My wife, who had been observing this with quiet amusement (having raised three sons)
  asked him why he found the type of such interest. He caressed the piece he had in
  hand - thought a bit and said, \"It's real.\"\r\n\r\n- Stan Harris, writing in Greg

    Big collections are hard to find. Plus, just on the practical side, one sale to
    the right collector/printer/museum is a lot more efficient than 502 separate Ebay
    sales. But... as you suggest, I may have to end up selling smaller lots, or by
    the font. Worth giving it a try first, though.'

    of wood type with a long list of high end type styles.\r\nAll the fonts are complete
    and in excellent condition. I have knowledge of them,\r\nI can only report that
    they are breath taking. The collection is a once in a lifetime opportunity. This
    is not for the casual ebay collector. To sell this collection one at a  time will
    separate the font groups that required years to assemble and catalog, verifying
    the historical foundry, the type style's catalog name and date. A wood type collector's
    dream. Inquire about the sale, be ready to be amazed."

    It really needs to be with a collector or museum. I doubt these days most museums
    have the money to acquire a collection like this, though. I would also hate to
    see it go on ebay. You'd make a mint \u2013 probably $300-400/drawer at least,
    but it might take you a year to do it!  Any thoughts of donating it somewhere
    like the Hamilton Wood Type Museum? There are others probably as well that I'm
    not familiar with."

  body: 'Sii: I do indeed care what happens to the collection after its sold. I''m
    going to try to avoid Ebay at all costs. I have a long email list of printers
    and collectors interested in individual fonts or small groups, and I will sell
    to them first. But if at all possible, I''d love to place it as a whole with a
    collector or museum that would really care for it, and keep it growing. It''s
    unfortunate the entire global financial system is in meltdown at the moment. It
    makes it much more difficult. It may just not be in the cards, and I know that.
    If you have any interest at all, even in the individual fonts, send me an email
    and I''ll send you the PDF of the inventory and prospectus, and put you on my
    email list in case I am forced to break it up. The prospectus is kind of interesting
    just on its own.    '

    Drop me a line and I''ll send you the inventory.  '

    this away. That they're still yours, but that the museum can exhibit them and
    take care of it. But I have no idea if they would even be interested in something
    like that.\r\n\r\nI have quite some boxes of woodtype, that aren't nearly as special
    as the collection in this thread, but even that I wouldn't just give away. Woodtype
    has been chucked into the fireplace far too much in the last decennia to just
    give it away. :)"

  body: I'm wondering if someone in this forum knows of a foundation or corporation
    that could purchase the collection and then donate it to a museum, receiving in
    return a tax benefit as well as some name recognition among exhibit-goers. This
    might, however, take more time to arrange than Mr. Dean has. Another possibility
    would be to find an "angel" or angels who might want to do the same. I would be
    happy to make a contribution but it wouldn't go very far, considering the value
    of the collection.
