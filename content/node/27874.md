body: "I've been working on a rounded style of Houschka for a while now. It's now
  OpenType as I have included some new features. Some people were put off the original
  Houschka because of the rounded shape of the A, W and w, (although a lot of others
  liked it for that very reason). So I have included contextual alternates of these
  characters in the new rounded version, as well as small caps (also with alternate
  A and W), lining and non-lining and tabular figures, and discretionary ligatures
  ct, sp and st.\r\n\r\nAny other discretionary ligature suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nNick
  Gooke, G-Type"

  body: "Looking good!\r\nBut the x-height of u,v,w,x & y seems lower than the other
    characters. Don't know if this is intentional or just my eyes going bad ;-)\r\nAlso,
    the ox might need some extra kerning, it's a little too tight now in my opinion."

    THIS is why I should wear glasses when working on the computer ;-)

  body: "I like this a lot. I wasn't familiar with Houschka in its original incarnation,
    but i prefer it rounded, and in the light weight and would more likely use the
    NON rounded shape A and W's.\r\n\r\nI'm seeing some glitches (white knockouts?)
    in Adobe Reader as certain zoom levels...\r\n\r\nleft stem of the m\r\nleft stem
    of the n (less so than the m)\r\nAE combo overlap\r\ng where the bowl enters the
    stem\r\nG where the curve enters the stem\r\n\r\nI guess you're probably aware
    of this if it's work in progress, but just though i'd better mention it.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for mentioning this, and I did know about it - it's the only may to
    blend certain characters between the two weight extremes, and will be rectified
    for the finished typefaces. You're right \u2013 this is a work in progress.\r\n\r\nI
    actually prefer the round style to the original Houschka, plus I have improved
    the shapes in some characters.\r\n\r\nThe good thing about OpenType is that you
    can choose between the different styles of A and W's.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: The "P" seems overpowering, when looking at the word "Pack." Is it just me?
    This has a very nice feel to it.

  body: "This would make a great addition to the surprisingly hit and miss category
    of rounded fonts. \r\n\r\nthe p, q, b have the same corner treatment where the
    strokes moves from straight to curve, yet the d is a right angle, I rather enjoy
    the treatment of the p, q, b. you might even make the angle begin early in the
    vertical stroke. \r\n\r\nalso, the rounds in the lowercase seem a bit inconsistent,
    the o, c, e seem to be based on a perfect circle while the g, p, d, b, q, have
    more robust curves. I feel perfect circles tend to have points on the upper and
    outermost extremes.\r\n\r\nI dig it!"

    I have done another rounded family; Chevin. It has been adopted as the corporate

    of the finished family.\r\n\r\nHouschka Rounded is pretty comprehensive with over
    830 characters. It covers East and Central European, Turkish and Cyrillic. It
    has a standard character set, contextual and stylistic alternates, lining and
    old-style numbers, both proportional and tabular, small caps, and 3 extra stylistic
    sets (as shown on the pdf). The top example is the standard set (with small caps).\r\nSet
    1 is modernish, set 2 is Art Decoish and set 3 has unicase characters.\r\n\r\nPlease
