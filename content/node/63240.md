  for and against doing such a thing are on-going]; ans as a part of this the typography
  is obviously going to change. I say obviously... :)\r\n\r\nI'm very aware of cultural
  differences and I don't want to offend with any generic \"yup, that font wouldn't
  look out of place on an Indian takeaway fascia in South Croydon\" type of affair.\r\n\r\nFor
  some reason House Gothic Black is working well at the moment, although I have no
  idea why; but I really want to avoid the obvious Sanskrit/Arabic styled faces.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\ns"
