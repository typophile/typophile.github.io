  the Futura from Elsner+Flake or Futura SB from Scangraphic Digital Type Collection.
  But these versions are quite new versions of the Futura. The logotype \xABFrank
  Mohn AS\xBB was developed in the eighties \u2013 maybe before the DTP-era... \r\n\r\nCould
  anyone help us, please?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Futura_4143.gif]"

    not the displayseries (on account of the pronounced inktraps, a typical feature
    of Scangraphic). But I don't think this is a Futura\u2026\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert

  body: "If I'm not mistaken, I believe the top/bottom proportion on the Ss is different.
    In other cuts the contrast between the size of the \"circles\" used to construct
    the S is more pronounced. The amount of assymetry of the crossbar in the lowercase
    t also can vary. \r\n\r\nI noticed IKEA uses two different cuts in their in-store
    signage."

  body: Only thing I know is Adobe's Futura is <a href="http://www.spiekermann.com/mten/2004/07/futura_the_perfect_geometric_t.html">not
    really the best digitization ever</a>. And I'm being <em>very</em> kind here.
    Unless they completely redesigned it recently. There are clear differences between
    the digitizations.
