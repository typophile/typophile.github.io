  body: "It looks fairly similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/electra-lh/|Electra]],
    but the C and S are puzzling. I have searched the Serif Guide a few different
    ways and have not been able to find this. I guess I will be tempted to say 'custom
    font', but I don't find this as a business (corporate name). What is is from?

  body: This is the Adobe Serif substitute font, the generic font that stands in for
    a missing font, mimicking it's weight and proportions. Hard to say what font is
    missing. Possibly Bembo, which has an unusually long tail on the R which would
    have the side effect of that very wide R in the substitute font. The other proportions
    seem similar.

  body: "Mark, do you know a way to make a type sample of this? I need to include
    this in the Serif Guide. You know, the \"MR Gabe JUKE Wygt QC?\" sample for the
    Guide Key sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Actually you can do it yourself, Mike. Compose a text in a certain font, close
    the document, deactivate that font, reopen the document, and then hope Adobe Serif
    does its job.

  body: "OK, thanks Yves. After I wrote that I started thinking there had to be a
    way to turn off the auto font activation of font management software I am using.
    That would be the key step for me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "You need to create a PDF with a font, deactivate the font, then open the
    PDF in Adobe Reader or Acrobat to see the substitute font. If you're seeing Myriad,
    you must be deactivating the font and viewing the document in the source app,
    such as InDesign or Illustrator. You will never see the Adobe Serif or Adobe Sans
    fonts in graphics apps, only in PDFs.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the Adobe Serif and Adobe
    Sans substitute fonts might be tricky to create samples of since they don't have
    a \"natural\" state--they take on the proportions and weight of whatever they
    are trying to emulate. So the appearance will depend a lot on what font they are
    trying to emulate. Still, it is probably enough to show the general characteristics
    of the fonts which are present regardless of weight and proportion (serif styles,
    general construction, etc.). \r\n\r\nWith this in mind, you might want to include
    a note about what font is being emulated, or maybe even create samples using several
    different fonts with different proportions and weights."

  body: "I have tried this about 3 times, and I seem to be having an awful time preventing
    the fonts from being embedded. I was creating a sample with six different serif
    fonts. Apparently Illustrator will not save a PDF without embedding at least the
    needed part of a font, unless the font prevents embedding. I created and eps file
    and tried to 'Print' it to PDF (after setting Distiller to not embed fonts), but
    that still showed the correct fonts (did making it eps change them to outlines?).\r\n\r\nFortunately
    Riccardo sent me Key sample images of Adobe Serif and Sans MM fonts, so I have
    something I can use for the Guides, but I am curious to see how the starting font
    affects the replacement result, as Mark suggested. I expect that the Guide characteristics
    (structure of letters) are not affected, only weight and width.\r\n\r\nHow should
    I do this differently to get the PDF that will show the Adobe Serif font when
    the original fonts are disabled? (Obviously I don't do this normally.)\r\n\r\n-
    Mike Yanega"
