  firm.  It's a solo practice, with a modern edge in that it's a mostly paperless
  office.  I'm a fairly young attorney, so nothing too traditional or old-school,
  but I also need something fairly conservative. \r\n\r\nSo, I'm looking for something
  that's modern/contemporary, conveys trustworthiness/warmth, sophistication and is
  still commanding enough to give the appearance of professionalism and knowledge.
  \ \r\n\r\nAnd and all suggestions are appreciated! "

    with a bit of personality and attention to detail. (Legal disclaimer: I don't
    own the copyright on the scales-of-justice clip art--I swiped it from  another
    lawyer's web site just as a style reference.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LAWFIRM_4399.jpg]"

  body: "Lauren, if you should decide to use clip art (such as the scales of justice),
    you might try iStockPhoto.com.  A huge selection of downloadable photos and illustrations,
    most are inexpensive, and legal to use (after you pay the fee).\r\n\r\nBut one
    danger of clip art in a logo is that other lawyers in your area might be using
    the same or very similar images.  \r\n\r\nYou might want to consider getting a
    professional graphic designer to help you out. Remember that designing the logo
    is just one step in establishing your identity, there's also the design of your
    letterhead, envelope, business card, mailing labels, your email signature, website,
    signage, advertising, etc. If any of your friends or business associates have
    logos and printed materials that you like, you might ask them for the name of
    their designer.\r\n"

    blended with the lighter serif. Thank you!\r\n\r\nStill trying to figure out the
    logo, but at least I've got some fonts. Thank you!\r\n"
