  body: "The serif sample is too small, and has too few key letters for me to use
    my Serif Guide effectively. Can you provide a larger sample and/or more letters?
    The twelve letters I need most are a,b,e,g,y and E,J,K,M,R,U,W.\r\n\r\nThe script
    should be in [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg1.html|Part 1 of my Script
    Font ID Guide]].\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    it appears the script is Splendid Ornamenty.. still not sure about the first one

    I knew there was something familiar about the f, and that was one of the early
    fonts I bought back in the 90's before Manfred made his fonts free.\r\n\r\n- Mike
