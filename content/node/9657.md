body: 'The forums are an intriguing dynamic. There are many variables to consider:
  Threads, Posts, Responses, Date, Time, # of participants, rivalries, pseudonyms,
  most frequent participant, etc.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve taken a quick stab at a visual
  representation of a thread, though this does not address date/time  &#40;I thought
  about addressing this in Flash...&#41; <BR> <BR>What are some other ways to represent
  these visually? <BR> <BR>...Yes, I realize this is a little out of date &#40;1 day

  body: ' This is pretty cool! &#40;But I don&#39;t think the second one really works;
    for one thing a given post isn&#39;t necessarily a reply to the one right before
    it.&#41; <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s an idea: <BR>Record each of us saying &#34;blah&#34;
    in his/her own voice, and play the whole thing as an audio sequence, real quick.
    The cacophony might make even me take a break from posting. <BR> <BR>Another:
    <BR>Have a colored square, assign a color to each participant, and for a given
    post flash the participant&#39;s color in the box, and fade it out slowly. Do
    an RGB &#34;average&#34; when they overlap. Assign a color to each participant
    according to their general &#34;tone of voice&#34;. I want orange. <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW,
    if you look carefully you might see a very interesting relationship between Anonymous
    and one &#34;other&#34; participant. But it might be coincidental.&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' that&#39;s just my laziness coming through, hrant. Originally I had planned
    on reading the thread in depth and marking responses as they truly occur &#40;ie.
    one post spawns 5 responses&#41; but I cut some corners, and this is what you
    got. <BR> <BR>I will post another info-visualization concept but I&#39;ll use
    a much smaller thread to save me a little sanity. <BR> <BR>jb '
