  body: what kind of graphic design would you call this? like what period? or movement?
    i know it's late mid to late 1800s but it's hard for me to find examples of this
    work because i don;t know what to search for.

  body: I suppose the period is Victorian, but are you looking for work from the period
    itself, or contemporary work that apes the style of the period? In the latter
    case, general terms like "retro" or "antique" might be more appropriate.
