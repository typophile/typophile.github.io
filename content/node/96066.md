  body: Could be [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/depressionpress/2080847355/|Othello]],
    an old ATF font, never digitized to my knowledge. The closest I know are [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/reserves/velvet/|Velvet]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/macbeth/|MacBeth]].

  body: "Yes, Velvet looks quite accurate; MacBeth is more ornate.\r\n\r\nAn outline
    version of Othello was created by Dan Solo and included only in the Dover Book/CD
    \"24 Outline Fonts\". It doesn't seem to ever be sold separately.\r\n\r\nA solid
    version, as well as a matching  fill version, was recently (2009) produced by
    'Character' and is available [[http://abfonts.freehostia.com/|here]]. They are
    probably back-creations from the Solo font.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
