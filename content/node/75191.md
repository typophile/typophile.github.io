body: The capital "C" and "G" are particularly distinctive, but the "C" most especially.  The
  capital "R" and small 'm' have a slight upturn at the foot...not a lot, but enough
  to be noticeable.  The small 'f' actually reminds me of a version of Chancery.  Does
  anyone have any idea what typeface this is? It's probably a more common face than
  I realize, but this cap C is really throwing me a curve, here. Thanks.  ---Craig
