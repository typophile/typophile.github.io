  another typeface, something i've been working for a while already.\r\nWell, i'm
  on the kerning phase so i ask you. Do you have any list of words too see if you
  have all the kernings correct?"

  body: "Interesting... didn't know this...\r\n\r\nMy teacher uses a good method.
    He is like a text with the problematic words then he codes something like \"right
    side of a is equal to ...\" and he just kerns once some letters and so see what
    i mean? Then he tries on the preview of FontLab the problematic words and so.\r\nAnyway,
    i was looking for a lit of problematic words and so and how to code that thing
    of \"right side\" \"left side\" i never coded opentype, already coded a lot of
    stuff like PHP, HTML, AS and so on and on but never opentype.\r\n\r\nJoel Santos

    me a bunch of words. I'm not saying bad of your work, no, i do really appreciate

  body: "You really have to spin through every possible pair. For example, only \"u\"
    follows \"q,\" right? Ever set transliterated Chinese? Or how about \"g\" following
    a cap \"Y\"? Seem odd? Well, the name of King Arthur's mom is \"Ygraine.\"\r\n\r\nYou
    need a bunch of letters in the kern window, so as not to fool your eye. I start
    with an \"e\", follow it with the leading character, then the character to be
    kerned, then several other letters. For example, starting out with lower case,\r\n\r\neaalestying\r\n\r\nwhere
    the letter I'm kerning is \"a\" (the first one). The second letter (also an \"a\"
    above) is the trailing one of the pair. Just use the keyboard to change & kern
    the second letter (from \"a\" to \"b\" through \"z\"), then change the first letter
    to \"b\" & continue on. In FontLab, the fastest is to also use the keyboard for
    entering the kern values. You have increments of plus/minus 100, 10 and 1 quickly
    available.\r\n\r\nDon't forget punctuation, esp. periods, commas, and the quote
    marks. And BTW, most of us don't consider an apostrophe an accent. Give it some
    space. Another thing to look out for are prefixes and word endings. I usually
    find the \"n\"& \"g\" in \"ing\" need a touch. Try several words ending in \"ing\".\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    I think it is enough to give them a little kern here and there against certain
    key letters that they colide with or are too far apart from.\r\nJust an example,
    the rest you'll have to figure out for your self, that is the best way to learn
