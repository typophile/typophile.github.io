  looking for a century symbol? Not sure if thats clear but its the C sort of shape
  used to represent a Century. Does anyone know of a font that has one of these or
  are they usually hand done?\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

  body: I don't know exactly what a century symbol would look like. Do you have an
    example, or could you draw one to help us out? Unless everyone else knows what
    it is.
