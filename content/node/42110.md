    place is packed with great information about type and typography. \r\n\r\nThe
    downside---it tends to attract quite a few jerks who love arguing on the internet.
    They love showing hubris to each other and engaging in pissing matches. I'm breaking
    ranks here to say this, and I don't mind at all. :^) it pleases me to tell the
    truth.\r\n\r\nTypophile, sure. Gripe-o-phile much of the time.\r\n\r\nj a m e

    why I'm here.\r\n\r\nI do a lot of photography. Did 3d modeling/animation. Design
    and develop websites. So I just want to take \"myself\" to a further level by
    getting into typography.\r\nThis might get a bit off topic, but if you have a
    good book to recommend, let me know!"

  body: "<em>So James, is the site about you liking others? =)</em>\r\n\r\nFriendship
    and the assumption of good faith on the part of other members is a major part
    of Typophile for me. I make an effort to like others and to be polite to them.
    A number have a tendency to assume bad faith however, and show an unmistakable
    arrogance or elitism. The assumption of bad faith is what I meant by \"jerks\"---knee-jerk
    reaction to things said. It happens all the time and has the effect of derailing
    discussions and causing some very silly arguments, needless topic drift, and bad
    vibes.\r\n\r\nIdeally Typophile should not be about me or any of its members liking
    each other. That should be automatic and taken for granted. It is supposed to
    be a civil place devoted to typographic collaboration. But that is a simplistic
    and vague definition. Some very fragile egos are involved here, and the fact is
    many accomplished typographers and type designers gave up up on Typophile long
    ago because of the snottiness of its denizens.\r\n\r\nThis is of course hard to
    prove.\r\n\r\nThe reception given to you Chris, for example, has been only luke
    warm so far. Only two people made the effort to welcome you. That's pretty slack,
    and apathetic to say the least. I made sure to give you the good news first, and
    the caution about Gripe-o-phile was made in good faith. I didn't say it to put
    you off, but to be realistic, as it would have been unfair to paint only the bright
    side of the picture. I doubt many other typophile members would have been as honest.\r\n\r\n<em>This
    might get a bit off topic, but if you have a good book to recommend, let me know!</em>\r\n\r\n*

  body: "<cite>Only two people made the effort to welcome you. </cite>\r\nThat's not
    fair. With a topic of \"Hi there\", how are some people going to know that they
    should respond in a certain way? Added to the fact that the number of new threads
    bumped it to the second page?\r\n\r\nMost Typophiles are good, hardworking folks
    who care about what they do, almost to a fault. They need to see things in a certain
    way, particularly the full-time type designers, because they need to have a conviction
    that what they are doing is worth it. \r\n\r\nAnd the count is now 3 :)\r\n\r\nWelcome
    Chris! If you're a photographer, feel free to share if you have a portfolio online,
    or if you find anything at all remotely related to type. Share and share alike."

    new here\" threads. We also don't have a minimum post count, or a for sale section.
    Not much spam.\r\n\r\nYou get strong opinions when people get off into their areas
    of specialization. There's much to learn, and I don't find that much fussing and
    fighting. Everyone has an off day.\r\n\r\nSearch and use the Wiki. There are many
