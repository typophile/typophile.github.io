  this year. The NCAA doesn't commission a site-specific logo, but they let the host
  school each year design an event logo (if they want), but it must be approved by
  them.\r\n\r\nSo, I've been chosen to tackle this. I don't have a whole lot of logo
  design experience.\r\n\r\nI want to include a recognizable part of the town (the
  arch seen in the background), and have a visual reference to gymnastics (the silhouette).
  \r\n\r\nI'm sort of stuck here. Any suggestions? The logo will be used mostly on
  the Web. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    the one used on the rest of the piece. Try using complimentary typefaces or just
    use the same one throughout. There needs to be either a certain contrast or unity
    to make things work.\r\n\r\nI can't say I'm really a fan of the background either.
    It's obviously just vectorized through some script and not done by hand to be
    precise. Could just be me. Good start!"

    A trap that many unexperienced designers fall into is including too much in a
    single logo. Simplify, simplify, simplify.\r\n\r\nFirst, start sketching by hand,
    not on the computer. Second, design the logo in black and white only. No colours,
    no greys. Just black and white. Pick out one or two ideas you want the logo to
    convey, and focus on those. Then come back and post a few of your attempts and
    we'll tell you what is working and what isn't.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    Here are a couple mock-ups using only black and white. \r\n\r\nIn the first, I
    tried to make a mark for \"The Arch,\" which is a symbol strongly associated with
    the university.\r\n\r\nIn the second, I used the mark for the gymnast, but there
    is no visual reference about the location of the event (which I really want!).
    \r\n\r\nI can't think of a way to combine the arch + gymnastics. Any suggestions?
    What about the type?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_1_5938.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_2_5530.gif]"

    also try using it as the upper uneven bar or parallel bars (most won't know it's
    for men).

    a hint: The fact that you are asking how to incorporate a gymnast into it already
    shows that the concept is not clear)."
