body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>I have a problem with Fontographer. My quotesingle and quotedbl
  don&#39;t work in Quark. They work in FOG, but when I generate the font, they don&#39;t
  work. <BR>The fill colour is OK and the font is generated as a macintosh postscript
  1 with a NFNT bitmap output. <BR> <BR>Has anyone else had this problem before? <BR>
  <BR>Thanks in advance, <BR>

  body: Sounds like you have &#34;smart quotes&#34; checked in the Quark preferences,
    which causes the &#34;stupid&#34; quotesingle and quotedbl to be replaced by the
    curly quote marks. If you have no glyph in these character positions, it will
    seem as if the &#34;stupid&#34; quote marks aren&#39;t working.

  body: Well, much as I love InDesign, this particular problem could happen in InDesign
    just as easily as QuarkXPress.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
