    out of my bank account, though!

  body: 'Dan, don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s a big event and things probably take
    some time. Just send them an eMail, maybe.  <BR> <BR>I won&#39;t be there. Somehow
    the last years there never was time &#40;and I&#39;m not too keen on such mass
    gatherings of designers, the last Red Dot Award in Essen was a highly frustrating
    and at times annoying thing&#41; and 2004 I just don&#39;t have the money, I spent
    all I have and much, much more on the new house and the restoration/redevelopment
    of it. Which is STILL going on, btw. It&#39;s started in November, took much longer
    than it should and now we&#39;re living &#40;and I&#39;m working!!!&#41; in a
    small attic, while downstairs about 6 guys come every day and do floors, walls,
    bathrooms, electricity, plumbing, heating. You wanna go to the toilet, you gotta
    trod downstairs to the basement, the only working loo in here. No bath, no shower,
    but lots of dirt. Power failures every few hours, because someone is working on
    the fuses and/or pulling the single plug that via a veeeerrry long cord gives
    us power up here beneath the roof. It&#39;s a very bad acid trip at the moment.
    Funny and somehow.. student... but bad.  <BR> <BR>So I probably won&#39;t be in
    Berlin this year. Maybe 2005, when things look up a bit. '

  body: I think you&#39;ll be in. They just need some time to get the paperwork ready
    and sent to you. It took with me also 8 days before I had it. <BR> <BR>Maybe we
    can meet there? We can make a date and place where to meet. <BR> <BR>Ren

  body: 'Ralf... are you sure? Well, that&#39;d be fun. No chance to talk to you and
    some of the other guys last time in Berlin, although the drive back to the airort
    with Markus and Ralf &#40;Turtschi&#41; was great fun... '
