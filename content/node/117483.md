    Chalet]]. If you mix the various 'years' you can find the right letterforms. Cut
    out pieces from the 'a' and 'e' and you have it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Chalet is a good candidate for customization. It is also deeply rooted in
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bauhaus|Bauhaus]] (or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/pump|Pump]]).
    To me, it's either a freebie or a complete custom job based on the same /o shape
    (mainly no optical correction): \r\n- /t = /o half bottom + 2 strokes\r\n- /a
    = cut /o + 1 stroke\r\n- /n = /o half top + 2 strokes\r\n- /g = /o + (/o half
    bottom + 1 stroke)\r\n- /e = cut /o + 1 stroke\r\n- /d = /o + 1 stroke"
