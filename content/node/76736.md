body: Hello there! I am about to start campaigning and I would like to base my posters
  around the communist propaganda style favoured by countries such as the Soviet Union
  and North Korea. My biggest problem is finding the right font! The text needs to
  be easy enough to read, so no backwards Russian-style letters or anything, and the
  capital D and O need to be distinguishable, since my name is ADO on the posters.
  I want the font to be imposing and cutting, perhaps with a little jaggedness. Most
  importantly, though, the font needs to be easily recognisable as a propaganda-style
  type! I hope that's not too specific for you; I've struggled, having tried a few
  such as VKB KonQa and Propaganda but not being satisfied. Thank you.

    \"Soviet\" and \"Propaganda\" are  good key words.\r\n\r\nI have a book titled
    \"Soviet Posters\" by Maria Lafont that would be a start.  If you look at that
    book on Amazon, it will show you a bunch in the same vein."

    lettering but is based on American industrial letters so you won\u2019t run into
    the legibility problems and general silliness of Latin fonts that mimic Cyrillic."

  body: "\"constructivist-era Soviet lettering\"\r\n\r\nThe propaganda era was in
    the late 1940s and 1950's--well past the Constructivist era (30 years prior).
    \ Stalin had either sent those guys to Siberia or they had wisely escaped the
    country by then.\r\n\r\nThe old standard 1990s Windows Cyrillic condensed bold
    sans probably would work fine."
