  body: "I tried typing out some words from the magazine as they seem more condensed.
    Lex is correct ID the font, but there seems to be a missing family...? \r\n\r\nDo
    you think they just made it more condensed themselves? If they did they really
    did a good job.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_3702.jpg]"
