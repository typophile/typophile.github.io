  appreciates Typography and it's history, as well as its future!\r\n\r\nI'm required
  to research 3 sans-serif classifications / one typeface for each classification.
  (ie: transitional sans, geometric sans, and humanist sans)\r\n\r\nI've chosen:\r\n-Futura\r\n-Gill
  Sans\r\n-Helvetica\r\n\r\n*I know that some of these classifications can be argued,
  but the main reason I'm posting here is to find a site/source (aside from Wikipedia)
  to use for my project.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations?"

    as Tracy's "Letters of Credit."
