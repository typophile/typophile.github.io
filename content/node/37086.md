    inscribed. I\u2019m Japanese and I\u2019ve never seen such a typeface.\r\n\r\n"

    brand has some smiliraities, maybe someone knows whats that font name is.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/brands/0010/7107/brand.gif]]
    \r\n\r\nor maybe that kind of numbering is the same as the 50 yen coin but the
    zero has the same shape on the 50 coin as in the hundred, so it must be some kind
    om resemblance don't you think?"

  body: What Ian meant with lettering is that this is not a font like a computer typeface.These
    letters have been drawn specifically for the coin (and possibly for the BBC logo
    as well). So there is no font that you can use on your computer that has the same
    letters and numbers.

  body: It's lettering, not a font. It's a condensed, elongated version of Roman numerals
    adapted to match a Mincho or suitable Gothic. Did some more research- it was a
    custom lettering job by a (most likely brutally underpaid) fellow whose name is
    not on record.
