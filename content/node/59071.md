  research on the origins of the type I've got in my studio. I'm fairly certain I've
  read somewhere that this typeface was a redrawn version of a pre-existing typeface
  from europe, but I can't remember where i saw that. Any one know?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-8_5825.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-10_5666.jpg]"

  body: "Mojo got it.\r\n\r\nAs I recall, the American Monotype company could not
    get a license from the Klingspor foundry to make Kabel available in the USA. So
    they copied it. It was available in metal in regular and condensed widths and
    in a variety of weights. I'm not sure that any of the digital incarnations of
    Kabel offers condensed weights.\r\n\r\nIt is still available as metal in the USA
    from a few places, including M&H Type in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nSome Monotype shops
    in the USA sold it under the name Cable. Supposedly the original name Kabel was
    given to honor the laying of a transatlantic communications line.\r\n\r\npowers"
