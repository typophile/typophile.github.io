  fonts I don't own yet.\r\nI was wondering if it is legal to use font previews (for
  example PNGs from fontshop) for testing purposes, and buy the font after deciding
  which one is more suitable.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to show a Photoshop draft
  here for some critique, for example, to decide which font is more suitable.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n"

  body: "I think there are people that abuse the feature (I'm thinking people who
    make web graphics for their ebay store) and that's probably why the public re-use
    of the bitmaps is not technically allowed. But if the images are being used by
    someone who intends to license the font then the vendor shouldn't really object.
    Putting that into the terms of use of a Web site would be tricky - so I'm guessing
    this is another case of \"turn a blind eye from the font guy\".\r\n\r\nNote that
    some sites (or foundries on distributors sites) use watermarks, stripes of give
    their previews a background color in order to prevent misuse.\r\n"

    for personal use, but it's not a commercial use either. It's just to test the
    fonts, share those tests with other people to decide which typeface is more suitable,
    and then buy the chosen font.\r\nIt would be quite nice if I could afford to buy
    all the fonts, but things are not that easy :)"

    It works for cheese stores and bakeries. I can't thrw much of a party party with
    the little slivers of cheese they hand out in the store, and it seems to me that
    PNGs of a font won't be very useful for turning out a finished design project.
    It's just a taste.\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: The FontShop previews exist specifically for testing fonts. Low-res comping
    is a perfectly legitimate use. Like Russell says, we hope you like our stuff and
    come back to license the fonts.

    rather long name I am using Titling Gothic Extended Light with for a website and
    business stationery, etc. and FontShop's preview was the only way to show the
    whole name to my client. He loved it and I bought it.\r\n\r\nI think FontShop
    has done a great job of meeting their customer's needs with their font preview
    and their shopping cart.\r\n\r\nSharon"

    up how they view potential usage.\r\n\r\nOn my site I have a large type tester
    with no watermark, and several layout features such as colour and tracking, among
    other reasons to encourage people to use sample settings in comps. Sure, some
    may use screen grabs as finished art, but I figure that's a reasonable trade-off."

    IP addresses and the words people are setting it might be possible for a distributor
    to uncover future top-secret projects and branding choices months ahead of official
    announcements - \"People at Apple seem to be really interested in setting the
    word \u2018iSpoon\u2019 in grunge fonts - wonder what they're up to?\" or how
    about this one \u2013 if someone were setting \u201CDeath to America!\u201D in

    low-cost, single-use font licensing</a> as a way to get students to purchase fonts.
    Now I am wondering if something similar could be done using Flash to sell outlines
    of a few characters to people who just only want to use a font once and can\u2019t
    justify buying said font. Has anyone ever thought about using a type-tester style
    app to sell a short sample of preset type, charging per character used, and delivering
    an automatically generated EPS file?"
