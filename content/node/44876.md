  forever to ID. It seemed like a ITC Caslon 224 Black Italic but the drops of the
  \"f\" and \"s\" are more \"Caslon Graphique or Caslon Black\" flavored that don't
  have italics or even Thorowgood EF. Anyone knows this? I need it to rebuilt a logo.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nadriano"

  body: That's the predigital typeface Caslon Extra Bold Italic No. 223. It appears
    in both the VGC and Phil's Photo catalogs (1980 & 1985, respectively). Unfortunately,
    I don't think that it has ever been digitized.
