  here because, as I recall, there is a prolific Typophile here with Armenian heritage,
  and I am seeking information. \r\n\r\nI find this whole \"Vote on the Armenian Genocide/Turkey
  being really angry about it\" issue to be fascinating. What I don't understand is,
  why are there questions about this piece of history? Is there any documentation
  on the subject? It is so crazy and scary when there is a state-sponsored attempt
  to revise/cover-up history... But I don't know much at all about this subject. Can
  the truth be revealed?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The Armenian Genocide needs to be viewed in the context of the increasing
    instability of the Ottoman Empire. This doesn't in any way excuse what was done,
    but it explains the ferocity of the Ottoman response to Armenian independence
    activities. The Ottomans had already lost several areas of the Balkans and other
    territories, and were terrified of losing territory so close to home.\r\n\r\nThe
    continuing question around the Armenian Genocide needs to be viewed in the context
    of Turkey being a member of Nato, the only Muslim country allied with Israel,
    and a potential member of the European Union. The first two factors have allowed
    Turkey to dodge the question. It remains to be seen whether the third factor will
    force them to confront it."

  body: "Thanks for the links. OK, I did some reading on the subject. John, you're
    completely right. Whether or not this was ACTUALLY genocide, is not really the
    point. Clearly, something \"genocidal\" occurred. Whether or not it is recognized
    as \"official genocide\", at this point, is completely political. Which, I assume,
    must enrage Armenians. \r\n\r\nAt first I thought, how interesting! There must
    be some crazy mystery surrounding the history of the Armenian genocide! But really,
    it's just a lobbying fight. In addition, what has recognition of one genocide
    over another really done for the world? It seems to keep happening in one form
    or another... "

    strategically important location makes it important to people who want unrestricted
    overflight rights when they decide to bomb or invade Middle-Eastern nations. The
    Bush administration has been leaning on the EU to admit Turkey in return for said
    overflight rights, along with the Turks not invading Kurdistan, and there are
    some camps in Washington that are quite paranoid about the possibility of the
    Turkish government being replaced by an Islamist regime. So any major embarrassment
    of the Turks and/or their  government is a big political problem.\r\n\r\n<cite>In
    addition, what has recognition of one genocide over another really done for the
    world?</cite>\r\n\r\nHaving other nations openly declare a nation to have committed
    a genocide is pretty embarrassing. And the Turkish government probably fears that
    once the Armenian genocide being condemned as a genocide around the world will
    draw more attention to the violent oppression of Kurds living in Turkey, and make
    comparisons between the two."

  body: "Genocide is genocide when it's politically expedient to call it same. What
    happened to the Armenians, what happened in Rwanda, what is happening in Darfur
    are all genocide, but the victims lack a powerful constituency. Almost as many
    gypsies as Jews were exterminated by the Nazis, but the extermination of the gypsies--lacking
    the influence of the World Zionist Organization, whose goal of founding a modern
    Jewish state were achieved as a result of the Nazi atrocities--is largely forgotten,
    or at least seldom mentioned, when genocide is discussed. On the other hand, Americans
    tend to overlook the fact that their European forebears eradicated a number of
    the native inhabitants of the North and South continents either intentionally
    (by warfare with vastly superior technology) or unintentionally (by the introduction
    of disease) that dwarfs any and all of the aforementioned genocides by several
    orders of magnitude. But, I suppose, genocide can serve a purpose: Jews have a
    State of Israel, and Native Americans have casinos.\r\n\r\nIf we move to the present
    day, James Puckett is entirely correct: Armenia then and Kurdistan now present
    serious problems for the Turks. This situation is aggravated in light of the present
    quagmire in Iraq--which is essentially an abstraction created by British colonialism,
    lacking any inherent homogeneity. What Great Britain called \"India\" (also an
    abstraction) devolved into two, and then three (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh),
    separate countries after the British adbication; what Great Britain called \"Iraq\"
    <em>ought</em> to devolve into three separate countries (basically East Iran,
    West Syria and Kurdistan), but Turkey won't countenance such a reasonable solution,
    because it would require them to cede the Western Kurdish territories to the newly
    created Kurdistan, and turf is what it's all about..."
