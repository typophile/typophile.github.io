body: "Hi there, maybe a strange question, but does anyone knows where the preferences
  file (or what file to back up) is located.. Well the thing is that the app some
  times crashes, and every time I have to restart, I have to set up my tools and personal
  settings all over again, and it's a little annoying.. So I thought if I took a backup
  of the prefs file, I could just replace it if it crashes again, to restore my preferred
  setup. Does anyone knows if it will be the prefs file or what file to back up to
  restore my chosen tools etc, and or where it's livated?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance!
