    how non-Swiss things end up having a Swiss flag on them.)"

  body: "Thanks Bendy, there is a closer picture if you are interested on my site\r\n\r\nhttp://www.borgeslettering.com/newwork.html\r\n\r\nGood
    question Altaira. My wife and kids and I love to go to a town called Leavenworth
    in our home state of Washington. It is a Bavarian (German not Swedish) town that
    is up high in the mountains. It is about as close to the Alps as I will get anytime
    soon. This font just reminds me of the fun vacations we have had up there.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.leavenworth.org/modules/pages/index.php?pageid=1\r\n\r\n-Charles\r\n\r\n"
