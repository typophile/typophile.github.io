  body: "The album cover was designed by Rodney Alan Greenblat in 1986:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Greenblat\r\nhttp://whimsyload.com/\r\n\r\nThe
    type looks very familiar, but I haven't been able to ID it. I sent Mr. Greenblat
    an email, and will let you know if he responds.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It is an actual typeface, according to Mr. Greenblat, but no name was forthcoming.\r\n\r\nI'll
    open it up to the rest of the forum; someone is bound to recognize it....\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    It's Filmotype Metro, seen here:\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/28813954@N02/9142381025/in/album-72157634337086325/\r\n\r\nIt
