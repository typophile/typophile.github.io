body: "This is a question for graphic designers, art directors, and typographers in
  general.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, it's difficult to find special characters in a
  font.\r\nFor instance, it was annoying to replace the vertical \"hash marks\" in
  a font with the correct, angled inch mark from the Symbol font, but now in OpenType
  fonts, it's even harder to find the character in the glyph palette, as there are
  so many.\r\n\r\nHere's what might be helpful in an OpenType font.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty
  straightforward to use the \"Superior\" feature for these:\r\n\r\n\xAE becomes \"registered.alt\"
  -- a small, superior version of the character\r\n\u2020 becomes \"dagger.alt\" --
  a small, superior version of the character\r\n\u2021 becomes \"daggerdbl.alt\" --
  a small, superior version of the character\r\n\r\nBut would the following be useful
  as \"Stylistic Alternates\"?\r\n\r\n' becomes \u2032 \"second\"\r\n\" becomes \u2033
  \"minute\"\r\nx becomes \xD7 \"multiply\"\r\n- becomes \u2212 \"minus\"\r\nl becomes
  \u2113\"liter\" \r\n> becomes \u261E \"fist\" \r\n\r\nThese seem reasonably intuitive.\r\nIs
  there any reason not to implement them?\r\nAnything else that could be added?\r\n\r\nI've
  already broached this subject in the \"Build\" forum, but now I'd be interested
  in the opinion of font users, rather than font developers."

  body: "Nick, despite it\u2019s really a nice idea and I can understand its usefulness,
    I disagree.\r\n<cite>Is there any reason not to implement them?</cite>\r\nYes,
    there is: semantics. \u2018\xD7\u2019 just isn\u2019t a stylistic alternate of
    \u2018x\u2019, just as you wouldn\u2019t put a \u2018\u2202\u2019 in some \u2018stylistic
    alternate (greek)\u2019 slot of \u2018d\u2019\u2014if there was.\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019re
    on a level where you care about correct differentiation of apostroph, second etc.,
    asking for a reasonable use of the glyph table isn\u2019t too much.\r\nAs Miguel
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/34108?from=012&comments_per_page=50\">pointed
    out</a>, ID lets you compose your own glyph set(s). With ID5, you can save your
    search/replacement routines. And now having GREP, there is not much one could
    miss, is there?\r\n\r\nRun a search on \u2018cipher(s), contingently followed
    by white-space, followed by x, contingently followed by white-space, followed
    by cipher(s)\u2019 and replace the \u2018x\u2019 with the proper \u2018\xD7\u2019
    surrounded by the desired whitespace. Safe it and you never need to worry about
    that again. And certainly you wouldn\u2019t want to have some arbitrary linking
    of glyphs in your font.\r\n\r\n(Talking about the glyph table: I don\u2019t want
    to be ID-specific\u2014there is cross-application PopCharX for the Mac, and a
    lot of similarly nice stuff for the PC, I\u2019d bet)\r\n\r\nToo difficult for
    amateurs? Possibly, but then the amateur really doesn\u2019t give a doop about
    the \u2113 and its companions (and he/she will be overexerted with the access
    of stylistic alternates aswell, no?) "
