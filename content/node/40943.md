  body: There really is very little like it. We might be of more help if you explain
    what you like about Freight Micro and why it won't work for you.

  body: I'm wondering if you are attracted to it for some of the same reasons I am.
    I find the exaggerated qualities somewhat handsome and ugly at the same time.
    Kind of like enlarging something only meant to be viewed tiny only to find you
    like the details too. It really is original in so many ways, but you might also
    like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/eldorado_micro/">Eldorado
    Micro</a> for similar reasons. It isn't as stylized, but it has some of the exaggeration
    due to be designed to be used at small sizes.

  body: "It is a nice looking font that I could not find anything similar to it.  It
    has qualities that at first reminded me of kontrapunkt or cholla slab, but then
    the serifs added to its uniqueness in a very strange way.  I have found fonts
    similar to kontrapunkt and cholla slab, but not Freight Micro.  I would say that
    I liked the way that it was displayed as a logo <a href=\"http://www.kongregate.com/\">here</a>\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI

  body: Hmm. In that case I think <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/emigre/malaga_volume/">Malaga</a>
    might suit you in some ways.
