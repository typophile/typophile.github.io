  in the discussion I anticipate. I made the comment [[http://typophile.com/node/53637|here]]
  that many typefaces don't support the [[Romanian]] language entirely (or rather
  correctly), by using improper diacritic marks for characters such as \u015F (and
  \u0103 and \u0163).\r\n\r\nThe most common mistake in found in \u015F. It uses a
  cedilla instead of a \"coma\" underneath it (just like a \u0163). \r\n\r\n[[http://kitblog.com/2008/10/romanian_diacritic_marks.html|Here]]
  is an excellent discussion on the topic, WITH EXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nSince many of the
  people that participate in these forums are type designers, I just want to signal
  this problem. Maybe things will be better in the (not so distant) future. \r\n\r\nI'm
  no expert on the subject. Just an occasionally frustrated user.\r\n"

  body: "@Nick Shinn, \r\n\r\nYou ask why this is an issue. When learning to write,
    they teach you that \u015F and \u0163 are based on the s and the t, but with a
    comma (the same mark for both). It becomes aesthetically displeasing to look at
    a s with a cedilla and a t with a comma, when you know they're supposed to be
    the same (it's my native language, so I admit I'm more sensitive to this than
    you). Furthermore, in some typefaces, the sizes (and thickness) of the cedilla
    and the comma differ, accentuating the difference visually. This becomes obvious
    in words that contain both characters. Here's an example*:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/diacritics_6060.jpg]\r\n\r\n*
    I have to point out the Adobe Jenson has the s with a comma. I just used it to

    object to two forms of the same accent, and that is avoided in the new Latin Extended
    OpenType fonts I've been making for a couple of years now, and which a lot of
    other foundries (not just the big computer/software corporations) are also doing.
    FontLab can take some of the credit for making this possible.\r\n\r\nBut moving
    on, can I get you to commit to stating your preference for the shape of the commaaccent?--and
    explaining why?\r\nI mean, how much like a comma should it look, and how much
    like an acute accent? Does this vary with different type genres?\r\nWhat are the
    preferred forms amongst the Romanian typographic cognoscenti? (Is there anything
    hip and indigenous, like the quirky Old\u0159ich Menhart Czech accents?)\r\n\r\nI
    realize there may not be simple answers. After all, there are variant forms of
    the cedille used in French, some connected to the main letter with a small \"tick\",
    and others free-standing."

    to how the comma should look. But I gladly share what I do know and prefer. \r\n\r\nI
    recently found a document published by the Romanian Academy, The Institute of
    Linguistics, that is relevant to your question. It was written in 2003. I will
    translate a small section here:\r\n\r\n<cite>The letters \u015F, \u015E, \u0163,
    \u0162 must me be both written with the diacritical mark positioned underneath,
    specifically a mark resembling a comma (situated at a small distance under the
    corresponding letters s, S, t, T), and not with a cedilla.</cite>\r\n\r\n[Excuse
    the overly literal translation.]\r\n\r\nAs you can see the document says resembling
    a comma, but does not give further guidelines. My personal preference is for the
    mark to closely follow the design of the comma (in the context of the font). I
    should say that in certain typefaces, they are exaggeratedly large (see example
    above, Adobe Jenson). The heart of the issue is to have it free-standing, as you
    mention. \r\n\r\nI will try to do some further research either later today or
    in the next couple of days. Maybe I can find additional specs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    indeed was a big part of the problem. For a long time NATO compliance drove character

    other standard character shape worked in most fonts without using compositing
    technology dangerously, or adding a whole new set of S contours to add the drawn

    I think we should use the comma and not necessarily create a new one that looks
