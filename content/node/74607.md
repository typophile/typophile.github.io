  you run a website to sell your fonts, you have probably considered providing one
  of those try-before-you-buy font testing widgets to your potential customers.\r\nWe
  have recently built a piece of software for this purpose: [[http://typeshow.net|TypeShow]].\r\nType
  something, pick a font and a style, and TypeShow will render it. That\u2019s it.\r\n\r\nTypeShow\u2019s
  front end is a jQuery plugin that easily integrates with most existing websites.\r\nWe
  have focused on simplicity and worked hard on interface details to give your website
  visitors the best possible user experience.\r\nYou can upload your fonts and completely
  customize the appearance through a dedicated admin interface.\r\n\r\nTypeShow runs
  on almost any web server, since it only requires PHP 5.2+, GD & Freetype\u2014unfortunately
  this means that there is no support for OpenType features, and there\u2019s not
  much we can do about it at this time.\r\n\r\nWe have released [[http://typeshow.net|TypeShow]]
  as free software under the terms of the GPL, which means that may download, install,
  use, and modify the code to your liking at no charge.\r\n\r\nLearn more about TypeShow
  here: [[http://typeshow.net]]\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking forward to your comments and
  feedback.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nFrank"

  body: "Thanks for the kind reactions so far. :-)\r\n\r\n@Ralf: There should be a
    way to specify a subset of fonts and themes for every individual page during initialization
    in the page header. I\u2019m going to check back with our JavaScript mastermind
    Marcus and let you know.\r\n\r\n@hrant: No plugins required, all your website
    visitors need is a browser with JavaScript enabled. If you see the word \xBBplugin\xAB
    in the TypeShow documentation, it refers to the way TypeShow is integrated with
    the jQuery framework. But this is also plain JavaScript and has nothing to do
    with a browser plugin like Flash or Quicktime."

    - There seems to be one bug after page loads. It's not showing styles for the
    first font on the list. But when you select some other font and then open again
    the first font, it's working normally. Any ideas why is that happening maybe?"

    page, with the list of all fonts. And if you choose one of them, you get in individual
    page for that font. Is it possible to include TypeShow for each font individually?\r\nSo
    it doesn't appear only on one page with all fonts in it."

    for setting up TypeShow per each font would be little tricky cause of linking
    TypeShow's JS and CSS in each font page (meaning = probably will have to make
    for each font new template page, just with difference in links for JS and CSS).\r\n\r\nThanks
