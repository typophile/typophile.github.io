  body: "I like the relaxed feeling.\r\nSome notes:\r\n* the \"a\" counter seems a
    bit too small (I would make it more lite that of the \"e\", in area if not in
    shape)\r\n* \"C\" and \"G\" seems top-heavy/unbalanced\r\n* \"g\"'s \"tail\" don't
    seems to work properly\r\n* \"Q\"'s tail could be better"
