    be fonts that <em>look</em> like Carson fonts but were actually not of his design
    but student projects. \r\n\r\nSome may be custom fonts for <em>Raygun</em> magazine.
    A few of these are sold by <a href=\"http://www.garagefonts.com/foundryinfo.html\">Garagefonts</a>.
    \r\n\r\nCan you toss us some font names?"

  body: I'm gonna ask a question I've asked before - I have this font, and if it is
    truly not available for sale is there anything wrong with my offering it to Fishfeed
    (not for money of course). He was willing in good faith to purchase it....

  body: "To answer your question, yes, there could be something wrong.\r\n\r\nA font
    no longer being available does not invalidate the license agreement. If the license
    agreement allows you to distribute the font file further, then you can by all
    means do so! But if the license agreement does not allow that, then I see now
    difference in the font's availability status. Sorry."

    to FishFeed.
