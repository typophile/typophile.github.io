    word AWARD. There seems to be (or was) an uncomfortable trend to tighten characters,
    when in fact everything set in all caps should be loosened. In other words, don't
    tighten the WA, loosen up the rest. Loosen is a funny word.\r\n\r\nL O O O O O

  body: "Thanks for the comments. The whole design is very loooose at this point,
    but I am tracking the caps at a setting of 10.\r\n\r\nBert, could you be more
    specific about what you don't like about the leading? I keep reworking the baseline
    grid but am fielding a continual stream of size and leading changes that are ongoing
    so I suspect it will all be reworked a few more times.\r\n\r\nAnd please do feel
    free to comment about the small caps as well."

  body: "Aside from the kerning issue--which should be dealt with--a more important
    one is to show a more clear hierarchy. Everything being close to the same size
    and color makes it less accessible and compelling. I would say: decide on three
    things that are most important, and make these bigger, and make the others help
    in a subordinate role.  Then the subordinate ones you can play with your typographic
    tool kit to get the right balance.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the treatment of 'save
    the date' doesn't seem to have the right emotional tone. It is surrounded with
    something flowery, and in the same script as the name of the dinner. The emotional
    appeal should be in the title, I would think, and \"save the date\" maybe tacked
    on in a bold sans, maybe asymmetrically or at an angle as a matter of fact advisory.
    Then the later notice can be the same design without the 'save the date' notice. "

    torn because at full size the IIIrd plus the M.D. feels very weighty. By the time
    we get to the progam there will be more text laden with acronyms.\r\n\r\nWilliam,
    I'm still in the phase of following the client's request on size and emphasis
    where I need to comply first then seduce them into something better. In my mind
    the date needs to be prominent as it is the primary piece of information, yet
    the style is to minimize this. The client wants the receipients' names large\u2014as
    large as the name of the event. So I'll continue to work with it."

  body: "I think you will find that if you set the type just a bit smaller, you can
    accommodate much of the advice (good stuff) you've been given. The size of space
    is every bit as important as the size of the type.\r\n\r\nIf you use the natural,
    unkerned space between, say, \"R\" and \"Y\" as the proper amount, then \"kern\"
    everything else (looser) to match that spacing, you'll be on a good track.\r\n\r\nOne
    general use of small caps is to not visually break up a line of type with so many
    full caps. But when each word begins with a cap (as with a name), you have already
    broken the line -- or, if you prefer, established a new rhythm. Personally, I
    would set the \"III\" in full caps, and that will mean that M.D. too should be
    in full caps.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    on anything you see. Note that I would like to keep the nifty Th lig., which will
    separate beyond a positive 22 tracking where it is now. Thanks again for the thoughts.
    This still isn't kerned, and I'm still mulling some of the more general comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hatley001_3650.png]"

    as their names. I'd treat the date/time typographically differently.\r\n\r\nI
    realize \"All Saints Health Foundation\" is also the same treatment but since
    it's separated it's less confusing."

    me. Not completely, but just enough to peer through your lashes. Single letters,
    words and lines dissolve into cloudlike shapes. That will allow you to consider
    the allover colour of the piece. And you'll be able to see where blocks of matter
    are uneven or too close to each other. It even helps to hold the piece upsidedown.\r\n\r\nBTW:
    It's almost impossible to review something on screen. I would need a highres print.\r\n\r\n
