  body: Duke University has another "official" font that looks something like Wedding
    Text (I imagine they would not like that characterization). The "D" shown on the
    cap in your link isn't from that typeface. I could be wrong, but I think what
    you've shown is hand drawn, originating about the time the University created
    the Iron Dukes, a group who financially supports Duke's athletic endeavors.
