  just wondered if anyone could expand on the meaning of the one that attracted me
  the most?\r\n\r\n\"Helvetica is the typeface for a deserted island\" - Friedrich
  Friedl\r\n\r\nI'm asking just so I can get my head around the understanding of the
  quote, would be great if anyone could emphasise the meaning of this to me!\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "It\u2019s a clever quote and works on two levels:\r\n\r\n1. Friedl compliments
    Helvetica by suggesting that if one were to be cast away on a desert island (\xE0
    la the BBC\u2019s [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr|Desert Island Discs]]
    program) and could choose only one typeface, Helvetica would be the one; and\r\n\r\n2.
    Friedl also hints that Helvetica itself should be banished to a desert island.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
    the way I interpret the quote. I could be making s*** up in my head. It happens."
