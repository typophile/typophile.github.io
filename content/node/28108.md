  articles (eg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearType, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering),
  they describe the process as individually controlling the RGB subpixels, with the
  side effect of the edge pixels being colourised.\r\n\r\nBut surely it's actually
  the other way round - ie the edge pixel is being shifted in hue in order to take
  advantage of a regular structure of the RGB sub pixels.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this
  a question of mere tautology as surely the OS doesn't know in what configuration
  the individual sub pixels sit?"

    Explaining how, CT filtering alone, works, is not particularly enlightening. One
    must also understand how the outlines are designed, and how the hints are used,
    and a couple of other things before http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearType makes
    sense, most particularly, the illustrations.\r\n"

    est) and B|G|R (2% est) so the MS ClearType tuner presents two samples and it's
    pretty easy to identify which you have - IF the OS is driving the LCD panel at
    its native resolution.   \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\nPS I think perhaps the easiest
    way to understand what's going on (at a basic level) is to find a coarse resolution
    screen (say on a typical Mac) and a magnifying glass and look at the pixels close
    up. \r\n"

    Is that 96 dpi? A Typical Vindows Machine is what?"

  body: Having read the docs, I now understand that the RGB sub-pixels aren't just
    lit according to the ideal geometry of the rendered shape, there's a tradeoff
    to prevent excessive colour fringing. But I think I have a problem with this colour
    fringing in that is hue is determined by the orientation of the edge being rasterized.
    I'll try to knock up a diagram to show what I mean.
