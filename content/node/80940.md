  with well placed grid lines and circles such as Denis Olenik's gorgeous work for
  Savviva:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.behance.net/gallery/Savviva-Corporate-Identity/688520\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0dcdd1014223dbcf4ec22696e86dcda2_6133.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  practice, I'm struggling with how to get the shape to actually conform around these
  circles when using Illustrator. I thought I was decent with the pathfinder options,
  but when it came to actually rounding shapes, I'm struggling with having perfect
  accuracy for where the circle falls.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I want to round off
  the corner, and activate Preview Mode in Illustrator to more clearly see the lines,
  the two shapes don't share a common point to snap to. Just eyeballing it doesn't
  feel terribly accurate either.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/circle_3635.jpg]\r\n\r\n1.
  Is there a way in Illustrator to be more accurate with snapping shapes to their
  sides rather than their points?\r\n\r\n2. Are there any resources out there that
  teach the techniques used by many type and logo designers that use custom line and
  circle guides?\r\n\r\nI hope one day to be as good as Denis at rendering these exquisite
  type shapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    everything for me.

  body: "First, I would say that those grid diagrams are more for dispaly than actually
    how the work was constructed.  In other words, they are often added after the
    fact. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to do this in illustrator with a bit of
    geometry (don't be scared!)\r\n\r\n1) Add anchor points to the straight lines
    where you would like the circle to intersect\r\n\r\n2) Draw 3 circles the same
    radius as you want your final curve to be.  Center 2 of these circles on the points
    from step 1\r\n\r\n3) Center the third circle on the intersection of the 2 previous
    circles.\r\n\r\n4) Celebrate!"

  body: "@earthache - I looked a little more into Smart Guides and unfortunately,
    the edge of the circle doesn't snap to the the guide that's on a diagonal.\r\n\r\n@Luma
    - Thanks for this bit of geometry. It's great in theory, but Illustrator's limitations
    appears to not be able to accurately put it into practice. Here's the problems
    I ran into:\r\n\r\n1. In order to do step one, I'd need to know exactly where
    the circle should hit. If I have to create a point on the line, I'm still not
    sure exactly where that point should be. \r\n\r\n2. Even with a point there, the
    center of the circles are not snapping to it.\r\n\r\n3. The \"snap to\" function
    ignores any object or guide that's on an angle. Even with a smart guide, I think
    I have to just visually guess if it's perfectly aligned."

  body: "I was assuming that you could use the estimation that you already had to
    locate the point accurately enough.  Maybe that is not close enough for you...\r\n\r\nSo
    the harder-but-more-accurate way:\r\nDraw lines paralell to the straight lines
    that are exactly as far away from the original lines as the radius of the curve
    you want to make.  The intersection of these lines will be exactly where your
    circle should be centered.  You probably have to know the actual angle of your
    lines, but that can be calculated easily enough.  \r\n\r\nSnapping to center is
    easy with smart guides turned on.  I don't really understand the snapping trouble
    you are describing, it sounds totally unlike my experience using Illustrator CS.\r\n\r\n"
