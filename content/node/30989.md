  body: "This is very cool, great use of green. \r\n\r\nI'd like to be critical (I
    assume that's why you posted in the first place.) I'll try and be as creative
    as possible, but it'll all probably sound nit-picky anyway.\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n1.
    I don't believe you need the exclamation point after 2007.\r\n\r\n2. the alignment
    of \"I am Emerald Green\" and the rest of the text makes the everything look as
    if it's \"tipping\" over. I'm guessing you used the illustrator alignment tool
    to align everything vertically. Visually, it's very heavy on the top left (no
    doubt because of the tree image.) I'd suggest moving the \"Green\" over to the
    left or add more ivy to the right. Also, your logo isn't centered to the \"Happy
    St. Patrick's Day 2007\" text.\r\n\r\n3. I would make the green for your text
    even lighter, not quite white but almost, it would really make it pop off the
    poster more.\r\n \r\n4. I love the background texture and the varying shades of
    green. Those are also some great looking trees you photographed!\r\n\r\n5. Excellent
    work on the vectors for the \"I\" and the ivy as well. This poster is beautiful,
    it just needs some \"tweaking\". \r\n</ol> "
