body: "Hello everyone, I am new member here (as of today) and have been browsing Typophile
  for some time now. I wanted to step foot into the forums and start getting some
  feedback and/or critique on some of my projects that I am working on. I am currently
  a senior Graphic Design student at Auburn University and have been working on personal,
  freelance, and studio related projects for the past couple of years. \r\n\r\nThis
  specific project is a personal project that I am working on under direction by one
  of my professors. While I can not go into much specifics about it, I can give a
  general description of the project.\r\n\r\nI am currently developing a new method
  for students to learn/practice how to correctly track/kern, and space typography.
  With this product, I am encouraging the student to step back from the computer screen
  and its default metric units, and focus on what is optically(visually) correct using
  a more \"hands-on\" approach. The product prototype is finished and I have just
  established a name for it. I have decided on <strong>NUDGE</strong> after much research
  and discussion.\r\n\r\nWhen researching what tracking/kering letterforms is really
  about, I landed on a few short descriptive words.... \"consistent, uniform, gray,
  rhythmic, alternation of solid and void space\". My conceptual vision for the mark
  was to create a logomark/logotype that was designed around these words. A mark that
  was very uniform, perfectly spaced, and had a great sense of rhythm and alternation.\r\n\r\nI
  wanted to get some opinions on the spacing, concept and overall appearance of the
  logomark.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5006817809_d29d1a1fa7_z_5680.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5007429486_7cedd17c3f_z_3524.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nudge_spacingVersions-05_4067.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nudge_spacingVersions-04_5992.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nudge_spacingVersions-02_5097.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nudge_spacingVersions-01_4199.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nudge_spacingVersions-03_6130.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Love the engineering style drawings but a couple of early observations on
    the logo:\r\n\r\nThe lack of overshoots make the n look too low and the u too
    high. The answer may be to round the terminals. Otherwise you will need to cut
    the straights off higher and lower on the n and u respectively.\r\n\r\nI like
    the thickness of the space between the letters to be (or at least look) the same
    as the counters but I may be in the minority. Then we are talking fifth down out
    of the six you have provided (or is it fourth down?) \r\n\r\nThe reality is that
    the engineering approach may not be helping you get something that actually looks
    right."

  body: Thanks Nick for your feeedback. I would definitely agree with your observations
    in regards to the overshoots of the n and u. I of course noticed it while engineering
    the mark and its grid, but did not know how noticeable it was. I think shortening
    the straights at the bottom of the n and the top of the u will help or fix this.
    I will try that out next.

  body: In my opinion, some overshoots are overplayed by some designers (just like
    some fonts are overkerned). It depends on the curvature of the curve for one thing.
    Your curves are quite tight so you might be looking at a little more than the
    2.5 - 3% of x-height which seems fairly typical. It's gotta look right. You may
    not have gone far enough.

    it.
