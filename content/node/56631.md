  body: "Looks very close to Memphis Bold, though this does seem slightly bolder,
    and the round tittle of the \"i\" diverges from the available versions. How old
    is the source: could it be pre-digital?\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/memphis/"

    boldened and with a customized tittle). \r\nBut maybe someone else has a better
    idea?"
