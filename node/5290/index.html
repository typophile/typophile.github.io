<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>In another thread, JFP said: <br> <br>"At my big surprize, the publisher wanted more pages than what my fonts and design proposed: to give to the potential buyer the feeling that he got heavy, so a complete dictionnary. If it was too light and thin, the future reader "impression on the object" can be very wrong: "Hey, for the same price between two dictionnaries, this one is more heavy and features more pages, its better one for sure!" <br> <br>I'm sure people do this, but as someone who sometimes dabbles in foreign languages, I have a different method in choosing a translation dictionary, at least. Any dictionary that contains the words "altruism", "vegan" and "quandary" is probably a good bet. <br> <br>Anyone else have any "tests" they'd like to share? <br></div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>A good dictionary must contain entries for the the Swadesh 200 List (which obviously contains the Swadesh 100). I don't know if you know what the list is (it's 100/200 items and/or concepts that every language has a word for, like 'sun' or 'hand'); most dictionaries for "larger" languages will obviously include these words, but some languages--indigenous ones, for example--require a little work and research to make sure all these words are present... believe me, it isn't always as easy as it sounds. <br> <br>Now as for your personal philosophy, it's a good one. Ultimately one's dictionary choice is going to depend on their own personal needs; I mostly compare notes on indigenous language dictionaries, so the Swadesh list is what I look for--because these languages are relatively new to the idea of having bilingual dictionaries, the important part in the first stages of creating literature is to establish the most basic of terms.</div>
