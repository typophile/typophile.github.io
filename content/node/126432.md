  body: "The font was created with  with Fontforge, and the name is \"Zhong0A\". Acctually
    I only create three glyphs, which are \"\u4E2D\", \"0\", and \"A\".  Letter \"A\"
    and number \"0\" are displayed fine in MS Word. But the font can't be applied
    to chinese character \"\u4E2D\" . However they work fine in Adobe Acrobat. Can
    someone tell me how to make the font work in MS Word?"

    body: I think they are all in the right place. I used "GB2312" coding and made
      the glyphs.
