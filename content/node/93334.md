body: "Simplepolator allows you to interpolate compatible glyphs in the same font,
  without leaving FontLab nor interrupting your workflow.\r\n\r\nSimply select two
  compatible glyphs and run the macro:\r\nFive new glyphs will be automatically created,
  allowing you to choose the best variation.\r\nMaking it super-easy to apply the
  Gunnlaugur SE Briem's method on \"How to make mistakes.\r\n\r\nA quick video showing
  how to use it:\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/42785809\r\n\r\nDownload:\r\nhttp://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/simplepolator\r\n"
