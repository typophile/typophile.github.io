  I'm making a PostScript OTF. Manual TT hinting is too much for me right now I'm
  afraid.\r\n\r\n- Adobe FDK's autohinter? Any settings or preparations I should be
  aware of before running the script?\r\n- Adam Twardoch's PS autohinting tutorial?\r\n-
  Maybe turn the font into TT OTF and use Ttfautohinter? What would be the process
  in converting to TT OTF? Will it increase the number of points on outline and thus
  amount to the filesize?\r\n- Any other good methods to consider?"

    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant

  body: I used to do manual PS hinting because I found situations in which I preferred
    the results I could achieve that way to what either the FontLab or Adobe autohinter
    were doing. But I gave up after Adobe took fonts I had made for them in this way
    and ran them through their autohinter. Now I used the FDK autohinter to generate
    stem hints. Note that you need to set up standard stem hint values first, and
    can affect the outcome of alignment zone hinting by adjusting the Blue Scale value.

  body: "Hrant: <em>does Adobe's autohinter work with Latin fonts only/better?</em>\r\n\r\nIt's
    script agnostic: it identifies stems based on outline architecture, and doesn't
    involve any knowledge of what the glyphs are. This fits with Adobe's long term
    hinting and rasterising philosophy: PS stem hints, alignment Blue zones and Blue
    Scale values, and standard stem values provides hints to the rasteriser about
    the architecture of the glyph. So it makes more sense to ask whether the rasteriser
    works better with some scripts than others, rather than asking whether the hinting
    tool does."

    your target market?\r\nDo you have the time to provide both OTF with PS hints
    and TTF with TT hints?"

  body: "Thanks for the comments! Well if it's good enough for Adobe, I guess it's
    good enough for me. Its definitely targeted for print, but I guess in the end
    there'll be always some people who want to use it on screen. So I'm thinking modest
    preparing for that can't hurt. \r\n\r\nI was thinking about turning the font to
    TT for the Ttfautohinter, but I'm not sure if it's worth the trouble. I have never
    made TT fonts before and don't know exactly what's involved. \r\n\r\nRichard,
    what would be the benefits of doing both PS and TT versions? I mean, doesn't TT
    OT work just as well for printing?"

  body: Would you consider hiring a TrueType hinter? Converting to TT adds to the
    file size, but using components wisely can save quite a bit. PM if you want a
    qoute.

    for the future, though.
