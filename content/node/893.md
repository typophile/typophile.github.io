  The other day I got my hands on some old issues of Herbert Spencer&#39;s one-of-a-kind
  Typographica magazine, and I found by far the best treatment of the font &#40;written
  by Excoffon himself&#41;, in issue #12 of the Old Series. The article contains developmental
  sketches as well as a technical analysis - it&#39;s a true gem, and probably a goldmine

  body: ' I believe that the Fair Use exemption for educational purposes usually applies
    specifically to a classroom situation, not just general edification. <BR> <BR>Section
    107 of the Copyright Code lists four factors that are weighed in determining whether
    an instance constitutes fair use:  <BR>&#40;1&#41; the purpose and character of
    the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
    educational purposes; <BR>&#40;2&#41; the nature of the copyrighted work; <BR>&#40;3&#41;
    the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted
    work as a whole; and <BR>&#40;4&#41; the effect of the use upon the potential
    market for or value of the copyrighted work. <BR> <BR>It is a subjective standard.
    That Hrant&#39;s intentions are clearly noncommercial and the fact that the work
    in question has long been out of print stand in favor of fair use with regard
    to points 1&#41; and 4&#41;, and to some extent perhaps 2&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Posting
    on a publicly accessible website could be construed as &#34;publishing,&#34; which
    is a slightly different circumstance than mere copying. If you wish to make the
    article available to those who are interested, Hrant, I would recommend offering
    to send individual copies via e-mail rather than publishing to your site. This
    would be more defensible as fair use, in my opinion. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR> <BR>Disclaimer:

  body: ' &#62; many up us cannot see due to potential copyright issues <BR> <BR>Well,
    if you have access to the ILL service at a library &#40;possibly through a student
    friend&#41;, you can always request that issue of Herbert Spencer&#39;s Typographica:
    #12 &#40;&#39;56&#41; of the &#42;old&#42; series. <BR> <BR>But I&#39;ll try my
    hand at some highlights/excerpts, sure. <BR> <BR>- Excoffon wanted to &#34;introduce
    some life&#34; into typography. <BR> <BR>- He started with a long-drawn process
    of figuring out how handwriting could work in type, trying to &#34;forget all
    the forms which typefounding had rendered traditional&#34;, and wanting to render
    the &#34;handwriting of the man of the 20th century. ... perfectly free, uncodified,
    and spirited.&#34; <BR> <BR>- He notes that the technical requirements were naturally
    opposed to letterform variety, and resolution seemed impossible at first. <BR>
    <BR>- &#34;I consulted and studied hundreds of autographs of important men of
    our century&#34;, and he also &#34;consulted the most eminent graphologists.&#34;
    But graphology turned out to be entirely &#34;analytical&#34;, with no hope of
    &#34;sythesizing&#34; anything from it. <BR> <BR>- He turned to his own handwriting,
    since &#34;any other method would be marked as artificial&#34;. <BR> <BR>- &#34;The
    absence of alignment {typical of handwriting} could not be calculated from the
    authentic handwriting .... in order to obtain a greater certitude in the average
    irregular alignment, a careful study of the data&#42; supplied by cryptography
    on the frequency of juxtaposition of characters &#40;in the French language&#41;
    enabled me to eliminate, or to foresee in most cases, sequences of disharmonious
    combinations.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#42; This is what makes Excoffon truly great: a gifted
    artist, but unafraid to &#42;think&#42;. <BR> <BR>- He implemented &#34;frequent
    variations in the inclinations of the main strokes ... &#91;which further&#93;
    enabled me to adjust as far as necessary the characters menaced by kerning&#42;&#42;
    &#40;mainly the l and the p&#41;. By adding some logotypes &#40;qu, st, ll, on&#41;
    I could increase the impression of freedom.&#42;&#42;&#42;&#34; <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;
    There are no kerning characters in Mistral, noting that it was born as a foundry
    metal face. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; OpenType, anyone? <BR> <BR>- He points out
    that having all the glyphs attach at the same height was a major problem in terms
    of authenticity. Fortunately, &#34;the roughness given to the outlines of the
    strokes ... &#91;confuses&#93; the repeated regularity of these strokes&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>- In order to increase variety, he varied the &#34;base glyph&#34; of
    the accented characters. <BR> <BR>The article includes initial trial sketches,
    and the best thing about them is that they show a great variety of ideas - there&#39;s
    a lot in them thar mines! There&#39;s also an enlargement of a lc &#34;a&#34;
    from one of the smaller sizes of Mistral, showing how much stronger the outline
    irregularity is, because it needs to be, to maintain character. And this is why
    so many &#34;rough&#34; digital fonts essentially fail: they need to have different
    versions for different sizes, with roughness inversely proportional to size -
    or ideally an MM axis to that effect. <BR> <BR>Further notes: <BR>1. The piece
    includes the original article in French. <BR>2. It is followed by a review of
    Mistral &#40;as well as Ashley&#41; by Stuart Hayes. In the review Hayes says
    that &#34;it is a remarkable technical achievement&#34;, but also points out an
    interesting problem: because Mistral was optimized for French, some common English
    sequences &#40;noting &#34;ft&#34;, &#34;fl&#34; and &#34;fo&#34;&#41; tend to
    &#34;stumble&#34;. To me the fix would be to incorporate non-French languages
    into the &#34;solution&#34;, and/or have different versions for each language
    &#40;maybe through OpenType&#41;. This language-specificity also applies to spacing/kerning,
    btw. Like in French, round-round adjacency is much less frequent than in English,
    and that directly affects the validity of the sidebearings of the lc &#34;o&#34;
    for example. <BR> <BR>hhp '
