  hearing opinions about what makes a great online portfolio. I'm especially interested
  in the following:\r\n\r\n1)Quantity of content - Should one show everything s/he's
  ever done? Or merely a small selection of excellent work? Or a range of pieces showing
  growth over time?\r\n\r\n2)Specialization - In a student site, would you rather
  see a variety of work (ie some print, some identity, some web design), or a focus
  on only the area that applies to the job.\r\n\r\n3)Process - Should one attempt
  to show the process of creating the piece with thumbnails, sketches, descriptions,
  etc? Or just show the final product?\r\n\r\nAnd any other input you have would be
  greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for your time.\r\n\r\np  "

    I'd show the range, organized by type of work. Again, you can tailor your portfolio
    to the client when you meet with them, or send them pdfs or links of specific
    jobs that might be especiallly pertinent.\r\n\r\n3. My preference - just the final
    project. I also don't like superfluous descriptive text. I think the work should
    speak for itself. You can elaborate on your process at the interview.\r\n\r\nI'd
    also try to emphasize work that's practical. I've seen so many student portfolios
    that are very showy but completely unrealistic. "

    great one that has been all over the web is:\r\nwww.okaydave.com \r\n\r\nOther
    than that I would get some books and read up on it... or better yet brainstorm
    what you want and go for origional. It's your portfolio it should reflect what
    you want."

  body: "I agree with PattyFab, show your strongest pieces of work; split the work
    into categories and make sure you include some (not a huge amount, a couple of
    lines' worth) of description for each piece.\r\n\r\nRegarding the question of
    what to show, I would show a wide range of work, but obviously play to your strengths.\r\n\r\nThe
    one main comment that I would say, and many design companies fall into the trap,
    is to make an over-designed interface and layout, rather than designing a site
    that is friendly, clear to use and navigable - think of who you're aiming the
    site at - agencies and/or clients. If the site is awkward, people tend not to
    hang around on a page, figuring out how something works in order to get to see
    some work, rather move on to a different site.\r\n\r\nShowing workings isn't a
    bad thing, but I would make a distinct separation from finished projects. Maybe
    create a section within the website as a 'sketchbook' area. I wouldn't take this
    work to interview, but an interviewer will want to know why you designed something
    the way you did - it might be a good idea to have a good look through your workings
    before your interview to jog your memory about the concept and how you arrived
    at the design of a finished piece.\r\n\r\nAgain, I can't stress PattyFab's comment
    of 'emphasising work that is practical' enough - it's really important."

    (and well-executed) like okaydave. this website landed him so many great job opportunities
    its unreal, he now works at a well-respected firm in NYC.\r\n\r\nhis portfolio
    especially succeeds at your third point, the videos show the process in an entertaining
    and refreshing way. otherwhise bland, small projects get great depth through it."

  body: "My brother - who's a web wiz - also advised me years ago that web users in
    general prefer the \"thumbnail\" approach to the \"slide show\" approach. They
    like to control their navigation of the site rather than being locked in.\r\n\r\nBoth
    these sites do that I particularly like the way okaydave has the thumbnails on
    the left with the larger image on the right (in the logos section). \r\n\r\nAlso
    - unless you are specifically trying to showcase your flash skills, keep it simple.
    I almost always click on \"skip intro\". \r\n\r\nhttp://www.louisefili.com/flash.html
    is a particularly egregious offender on this score. Otherwise it's a gorgeous
    site. It would be even better if the large image appeared in the rollover rather
    than requiring a click."
