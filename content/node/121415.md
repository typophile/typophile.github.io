  body: "Thought I could find a match... Closest I have is [[http://www.dafont.com/florencesans.font|Florence
    Sans]] with main difference on /M (or horizontally mirror /W?). Can't explain
    why exactly but I have the feeling it could be a freebie/amateur. Some more loosely
    similar: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/century-gothic|Century Gothic]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/filson-pro|Filson]]\r\nFind
    more samples, /G and /S look terrible and letters all together completely inconsistent...
    Mash-up? Avenir x Engravers/Blair x edition?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/download_5051.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/download_6017.jpg]"
