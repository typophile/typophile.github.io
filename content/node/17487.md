  so lots of landscapers' trucks in the mornings. Their logos are challenging, it
  seems, because it's just so tempting to use a tree in the logo. But along comes
  a truck, and while it did have a tree in the logo, it used this nice, crisp typeface.
  The c curled over at the top naturally and it ever-so-subtly implied a leaf, without
  even being modified. Just the natural characteristics of the typeface. Ahhhh. But
  then the light turned green and I snapped out of it.\r\n\r\n "
