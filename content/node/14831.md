    it. Then type \"o\", and kern the o underneath the breve.\r\n\r\nUnless you are
    using a glyph-rich OpenType font, which should have that glyph. You can insert
    it using Character Palette, and Quark should understand it. (I honestly have not
    used Quark in years for the same reason that I don't use a horse-and-buggy to
    get around.)"
