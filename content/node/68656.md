body: "March 22, 2010\r\n\r\nDez Boulder is a Strong-Brewed OpenType display face
  with Multiple Personalities.\r\n\r\nDezcom Typefaces is proud to announce the release
  of \"Dez Boulder,\" a rock-on typeface with three personalities on display.\r\n\r\nThe
  Dez Boulder family of display faces acts in a supporting role to give meaning to
  message and context to content. It is a very bold face, not understated. Each of
  its three personalities (and their sub-personalities) have a different timbre to
  speak the nuance of your message in a bold voice. Dez Boulder works like a character
  actor, presenting the author\u2019s lines but not with the deadpan delivery of a
  news reporter. Boulder develops the role, adding meaning through facial expression,
  gesture, and body language.\r\n\r\nA bold and character-rich display family in three
  personalities: ego, id, and alter, each with its own way of acting\u2014Dez Boulder
  averages more than 800 glyphs per style with uppercase, lowercase, small caps, proportional
  lining figures, small cap figures, superiors, inferiors, fractions, stylistic sets,
  alternates, ordinals, case specific punctuation, and more. It has a full range of
  diacritics and covers all European languages using the Latin script.\r\n______\r\nhttp://dezcom.com/typefaces/boulder/\r\n\r\nhttp://dezcom.com/typefaces/boulder/DezBoulderSpec.pdf\r\n\r\nCopyright
