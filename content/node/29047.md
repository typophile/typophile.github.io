body: "Greetings for All Developing Typophiles\r\nArabs unnecessarily do place Zamma
  before every Waw, Fatha before every Alif and Kasra before every Ya. And they use
  both tooth-like hamza + mark on or below Alif Though the mark alone indicates Hamza.\r\nI
  have been battling the web so that Arab make the change, but the only answer I get
  is:\r\nOur Fathers were on a course, and we are have to follow their footsteps?\r\n\r\nNow,
  it is the turn to the latin-oriented.\r\nTriggered by the still-hot topic <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28777\">Do
  ligatures improve readability?</a> that I have been monitoring from the very beginning,
  I would like to ask:\r\nWhy is there a dot on i and j? Why not dotless and why not
  using one dot for \xEF..?\r\nAt least the \"fi\" problem (if any) is half-solved?!
  Do dots improve readability? Any other reason?\r\nThinking Aloud, Allowed?!"

    been pursuing (for Latin) since 1998, and I can assure you: you will encouter
    hordes of loud, outraged pseudo-intellectuals! Just try to do your own thing,

    including <a href=\"http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/deseretalphabet.htm\">Deseret</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.unifon.org/\">Unifon</a>, neither of which have a very
    broad following, but they make interesting studies.\r\n\r\nTurkish Latin is itself
    a reformed alphabet, wherein the entire language was transferred from one writing
    system to another by decree, But, as evidenced by the complex system of accents
    the Latin alphabet isn't particularly well suited to Turkish on its own. "

  body: 'The story on the i and j, IIRC, is that as black letter, especially textura
    evolved, it became hard to distinguish an i from the stems of the n, m, etc. And
    to distinguish it, they put a diagonal line above it. This evolved into the dot.
    The j was originally just a swashed i at the beginning of words. It was adopted
    in languages other than Latin, such as English, for a different sound than the
    i, and so became a separate letter.  '
