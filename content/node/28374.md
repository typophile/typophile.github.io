  body: 'I think it is <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?1NL">Modern Nr. 20</a>.
    A TrueType version of this font is provided free with the Microsoft Office Value
    Pack (Macintosh), says identifont. And, well, I cheated a little bit, as I watched
    at <a href="http://www.bluestoneonline.net/">this site</a>. '

      in to the website page and looked at the source code and didn't see any reference
      to Modern Nr. 20.\r\n\r\nJust curious to learn so I don't always have to bother
      the people on the board.\r\n\r\nNatalieboh"

  body: "Natalie, I meant that the tiny pic you provided was too small to be exact.
    So I searched for the Blue Stone Grill-website. And ... voil\xE1 ... the sample
    there was much bigger. And www.identifont.com for example is a wonderful tool
    ..."

  body: I have found it doesn't get specific enough for me in "Fonts by Appearance"
    but I've never checked out "Fonts by Similarity" before, that looks useful.
