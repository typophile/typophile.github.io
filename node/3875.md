  body: ' The all caps Volvo titling font is an exclusive typeface, not available
    on the market. I know because we occasionaly work for them, and have a copy on
    our server. I can give you the name tomorrow when I&#39;m back at the office,
    but that&#39;s all I can do, I&#39;m afraid. '

    I suspect because Bill Hill correctly prefers fonts with short descenders, at
    least for text&#41; - the Akzi is a dead giveaway. The &#34;Broad&#34; though
    seems to be unique, and to me pretty attractive; look at that &#34;3&#34;! <BR>

  body: 'THX Hrant! I used to do this kinda stuff for a living when I was the local
    so-called &#34;type expert&#34; at FontShop Belgium &#40;I used to study the FontBook
    nightly before going to bed, which proves how type-nerdy I can get&#41;. You&#39;re
    right about the attractiveness of Volvo Broad: the vertical stress in combination
    with the rounded corners give it a nice tension, making it an extremely sexy face.
    <BR>And Scoles, don&#39;t you go stealing my thunder: I was the one who pointed
    out at the beginning of this thread that Volvo Broad was &#34;completely proprietary&#34;
    &#40;which proves what a vain glory-hound I am&#41;  ;P <BR> <BR>As far as similar
    faces go: although there&#39;s more than enough condensed grotesks out there,
    the typical straight &#34;S&#34; &#40;almost a mirror image to the &#34;Z&#34;&#41;,
    &#34;C&#34; and &#34;G&#34; with horizontal endings, as well as the signature
    &#34;W&#34; make it extremely hard to find a substitute. <A HREF="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90004.html"
    TARGET="_blank"> Berthold Block</A> Extra Condensed is the closest match I can
    think of. It has the vertical stress, the rounded corners, the signature &#34;W&#34;
    et al, but its wobbly outlines lack the tension of the real thing.'

    Rooster face is an almost perfect match. It&#39;s not as condensed, and the &#34;Q&#34;,
    &#34;&amp;&#34; and &#34;9&#34; are dead give-aways, though, despite what Usherwood,
    Jackaman and co. might say. Is this a &#34;chicken or egg&#34; situation? Does
    anyone know when Volvo Broad was designed? Elston was digitized in 1993, but I
    don&#39;t know what year Usherwood&#39;s original dates from. <BR> <BR>I know
    OF Jan Middendorp: I barely know him, as he kinda replaced me after I left in
    the mid-nineties. I read the stuff he writes for &#34;Druk&#34;, the <A HREF="http://www.fontshop.be/"
    TARGET="_blank"> FontShop</A> mag &#40;section &#34;Boeken en magazines&#34; &#62;
    &#34;Magazines&#34;&#41;. I can deduce from his writings that he must be interesting
    and funny, indeed.'
