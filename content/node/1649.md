body: Hello folks, <BR> <BR>Can anyone give me some info on a font called Garrison
  Sans? It looks like it doesn&#39;t exist anymore yet I can see some references on
  the web when I do a Google search? Is it a knock-off or an old legit typeface that
  is now out of print? <BR> <BR>Regards <BR>PAUL

    <BR>&#34;That is an old DTC twin of Gill Sans bold or Humanist 521 Bold BT. It
    comes with any old Micrografx program: run the install, <BR>choose &#34;customized&#34;
    and check only the fonts to install.&#34; <BR>'
