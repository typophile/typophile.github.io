body: "Hey all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for some help with a nice font combination for
  my PhD thesis. I wrote it in MS Word (big mistake), but after seeing the font used
  by LaTeX (CMU family), I initially chose CMU Bright for headings and CMU Serif for
  body text.\r\n\r\nThis feels a little antiquated now, and I'd like a clean and modern
  feel to the thesis. I've been playing with a couple of different font combinations,
  and have settled on:\r\n\r\nOpen Sans (Light/Bold)\r\nBree (Thin)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    \u2014 it would be useful for them to know what is your topic about. Also, Bree
    is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif|sans serif]] font designed particularly
    for large sizes, it is advised to use serif fonts for long texts; particularly
    if the content is academic."

  body: "If this were an advertising job designed to grab peoples' attention on casual
    inspection, such charmingly decorative fonts might be just the thing.  OTOH, a
    PhD thesis generally has a captive audience already, and in any case is intended
    to convince people by virtue of its content, not its typography.  \r\n\r\nWhat
    you want here is something that (a) is comfortably readable, (b) looks professional,
    and (c) <strong>doesn't get in the way</strong> of the content.  IMO anything
    else is not only superfluous, but counterproductive.\r\n\r\nWhen typesetting book
    or academic text \u2013 or anything where the content is the critical aspect \u2013
    the ideal font is one which the reader doesn't even consciously notice, so long
    as it accomplishes (a), (b) and (c) as noted above.  Any 'message' that the fonts
    convey should be strictly subconscious. \r\n\r\n(I've heard more than one professional
    say that when they see overtly beautiful fonts in resumes or academic work, their
    immediate thought is \"OK, what's the author trying to hide?\")\r\n\r\nFor the
    body text, I definitely think serif type is called for.  (I know some people challenge
    the theory that serif types are easier to read in running text, but I'm a firm
    believer in that particular orthodoxy.)"

  body: "Thanks for the responses. I've been looking for a clean serif font for a
    while and haven't found one I can settle on.\r\n\r\nMy thesis is on the natural
    barrier that exists between the blood and brain (to protect the brain and provide
    all the nutrients it needs in a carefully controlled way), and uses our current
    understanding for the design of next generation drugs to treat brain conditions.
    Not exactly bed time reading!\r\n\r\nSince it's a thesis it's not something that
    people would ordinarily come across, so my font selection is more about reducing
    reader fatigue and clean presentation, rather than pulling them in for aesthetics."

  body: 'Will your thesis contain many equations, formulas, or tables of numerical
    data? If so, compare the numeral <strong>1</strong>, the lowercase <strong>l</strong>,
    and the capital <strong>I</strong> in any font you''re considering. In many sans-serif
    faces, it''s difficult to tell those three characters apart, which leads to confusion
    in reading equations and formulas. '

    mean by \"clean\") doesn't necessarily correlate to ease/comfort in reading.  Personally,
    I think a traditional face like Bembo, Galliard, or Janson makes for superbly
    readable, comfortable text.\r\n\r\nIf by \"clean\" you're thinking of something
    more in the transitional vein, I recall seeing an article not long ago which claimed
    that people were statistically slightly more likely to agree with something set
    in Baskerville than with other fonts.  For a PhD it might be an edge worth thinking
    about.  :-)\r\n\r\nIf you want something specifically open and uncluttered, Constantia
    actually isn't a bad face, although I'm not sure how well it would hold up for
    dense multi-page writing.\r\n\r\nSpeaking personally, for a long time I favoured
    Marty Pfeiffer's <a href=\"http://scootergraphics.com/nuserif/index.html\">Nu
    Serif</a> for prose.  It's a nicely neutral serif face which is easy to read,
    although the high x-height may not be everybody's cup of tea. "

    Alex, Nu Serif <em>really</em> smells like an outline-swipe job... Some Times

    feel very heavily weighted. Text feels really boggy and dark (to me) with anything
    I've tried except for CMU Serif.\r\n\r\nBembo or Garamond Light might do the trick!
    I'll have a play and see how they look."

  body: "@hrant: Well, it was the first font family I ever bought, so I have a certain
    soft spot for it.  The designer claims it for an adaptation of a bitmap font called
    Espy Serif; since I have (after all) done something similar with Workplace Sans,
    I was inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.  His fonts are also very
    well hinted, which doesn't strike me as typical for quickie-knockoff jobs.  \r\n\r\nOTOH,
    you've a point that the letterforms are <em>very</em> similar to Stone Serif (with
    some subtle differences), which I never actually noticed before.  My only exposure,
    hitherto, to Stone is some samples in the Meggs-Carter book; I've never used it
    myself, although I'm thinking now maybe I should look into it some more. :)\r\n\r\n@OP:
    Bembo is my favourite face for \"book\" style text.  I think it'd be an excellent
    choice.  (For shorter professional documents I tend to prefer Sabon, but it may
    be a bit condensed for lengthy prose.)"

  body: "There is a reason for some fonts having a darker texture \u2014 as Alex mentions;
    it makes the printed matter more comfortable to reader. I would go with Garamond,
    but it will take someone very experienced in typography to make it work well.
    If you are having trouble in choosing the right font, it's better to pay attention
    to what will professionals recommend. I would advise you to use either Cambria
    or Constantia as your main body font."
