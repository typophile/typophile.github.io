  body: Tiff don&#39;t forget Alejandro LoCelso... our mate from blighty who brought
    Ruben Fontana to see us and Chris. He probably knows a bit about anything Argentinean.
    I think he went back to Argy. I saw him here in Brixton last year and he moved
    back.  <BR>ta <BR>vince

    work better in Castellano: &#34;Somericanos&#34;. '

  body: Tiffany <BR>Natalia&#39;s work is a custom typefaces.... like my Estrada Hand
    too. <BR><a href="http://www.sudtipos.com.ar/servicios.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sudtipos.com.ar/servicios.htm</a>
    <BR> <BR>There are some characters shapes in education here that doesnt fix with
    the existing tyefaces. <BR> <BR>In my case, Editorial Estrada called me because
    they were using a handwriting font to teach 6 years old childs to write. But the
    problem was that the teachers seems to use diferent characters than the editorial
    used at the book. So... childs were confused and we had to develope a lot of changes
    at the original font.. <BR> <BR>Sorry for my english

    with a couple fonts. Natalia&#39;s is very close &#40;well at least similar&#41;
    to another I&#39;ve found. I just can&#39;t find an entire character set of Natalia&#39;s
    design.  <BR> <BR>Alejandro, do you know for which publication she created her
    type? '

  body: 'hi, Tiffany. <BR> <BR>I worked with Natalia at the same publisher where she
    developed her typeface &#40;it was done for a series of schoolbooks&#41;, and
    I&#39;m pretty sure the typeface belongs to the publisher, called Puerto de Palos
    &#40;<a href="http://www.puertodepalos.com" target="_blank">http://www.puertodepalos.com</a>&#41;.
    Natalia no longer works there, but I could send you the current art director&#39;s
    contact info &#40;it&#39;s not on their website&#41;. Or you could just contact
    Natalia &#40;see Hrant&#39;s message above&#41;. Let me know what you think. <BR>
    <BR>btw, Natalia posted here once, on a Hispanic Community thread: <BR> <BR><a
