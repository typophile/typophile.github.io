  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am offering lead types for letterpress and I started my
website http://www.bleisetzer.de/ some years ago using
Koch-Fraktur for the headline:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4752.jpg]

In the meanwhile I cannot see it any more: too much black,
too heavy. So I decided with support from a young designer
to organize a relaunch of my website (starting soon) with
new logos and new screen font (Georgia).

This is the new logo. Please let me know what you are
thinking about it. To see what I am showing and offering
its easier (for me) to ask you to visit my website 'cause
my english is too poor, alright?

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_web_3844.jpg]

Approx. 40 percent of my sales are going to letterpress printers
out of Germany (UK, Italy, Luxembourg, US). And I am dealer of
(still existing) Stempel and Bauer. So I wanted to show a smell
of "historic touch out of the 20ies", but without sentimentals.

Thank you in advance for your critique.

Georg

Generally a great improvement, as it doesn't imply that museal touch. Will be intersting to see if your customers will accept your new Id.

p.s. you're pretty lucky that the prussian flag is b/w only ;-)
p.p.s. make sure you use lead Futura (in the appropriate size, naturally)!</div>

In understand exactly what you mean.
But I love borders. Not only in typographic designs, but although in my life. This is what (for me personal) is "Preußen". Its like our flagg. Its black and white - true or lie, yes or no, good or bad. Everything what ís damaged in our 'modern' times. But life is not fun, its duty. And the satisfaction at the end is to have done his damned duty. And to give it to the next generation of cours. (very old-fashioned? So what?)

This is a picture of the building the PBM will move to within the next three months:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bagel_2_3912.jpg]

Its an old paper factory nearby.
I talk to the owner, Mr Bagel. And (it was like a realization of the Matrix movie) he got his education for typesetter at the same printer I got - but 20 years before. The PBM fits 100 percent to this building. Its the same style: 90° angels, no curves. Its like coming home.

I need the lines as borders for protection.
Oh yes, I do.

		<div class="commentbody">On the logo: Futura Caps are stronger than the lower case, so I think having the name of your company in all caps will look better. This may require the rest to be smaller, but that I doubt that that will be a problem. 

On the lines: I agree with Franz that the rules don't work well here. They don't seem to have a functional purpose, and they also don't add to the visual balance, but detract from it. If you want rules in the design, I think another layout will be needed. 

I would also think about a design that balances the weight of the black and white flag in the type layout. 

Oh I just checked some of the designs of Tschichold. Your assymetric clean sans layout is of the spirit of Tschichold in his modernist phase. There he didn't use a rule like this, and perhaps it is out of place in this style of design. He does have designs with a thick rule to the *right* of a right ragged column of information.

You could experiment with that here by killing the rule at the top and putting a strong rule to the right of the information column, in  the business card. Here the idea would be to balance the flag at the top left assymetrically with the rule at the bottom right... 

[edit: just read Tim's comment. That is another way to go. in any case, I think this needs further experimentation to really get it balanced.]   </div>

		<div class="commentbody">No eagle anymore, Steven.
My "being Preuße" is more than just a spleen.
And historicaly Preußen used the eagle more after 1871, after it became responsible for the whole "Deutsches Reich" and showed the pruss flagg with the crown of Wilhelm II. But he escaped to the Netherlands in 1918 - ah.. bah.. I do not believe in monarchy.
Preußen is much more than this. Its a lifestyle from the innerheart.
So I decided to skip that eagle going back to the roots - black and white.

Its although in the "Preußen Hymne" "I am a Pruss do you know my colours?": http://www.bleisetzer.de/img/ichbineinpreusse.mp3

I am hot on showing the new website layout, but its still a lot of work. I hope, we'll be ready middle of February.

I miss the Koch Fraktur, though. Your new design is simpler, and better. And the flag is better than any eagle you could ever get. But my heart beats for Koch's letters. Futura is a great typeface, but it is not warm. I would not spend a night with her.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Dan,
I know and I understand what you mean.

But this was realy what I wanted:
To skip the warmness of the Koch-Fraktur.

'A website is a kind of charakterization of its owner'
Who said it? May be only I did..

May be its clearer in a week or so when we change the website.
No english word any more for the buttons (But english translations for the lyers :-)
I hate the (mostly wrong, wrong, wrong) use of anglizisms in my german language. And someone like you, living in Germany and knowing both languages, should write an article here about the funny german-english slogans and words, lots of german companies in the past tried to give themselves a kind of 'international image'.

My Online-Shop will be a 'Magazin'.
My email button will show 'ePost'

The whole site will be black on white - like the flagg.
All buttons will appear in Futura Buch. All text will be in Georgia.
I love it.

Tomorrow, Monday, is the day of decision if I get the new rooms I want to move to with the PBM. If I get it - and it looks nice - I'll integrate pictures of the Bagel paper manufacturer. If they agree, I'll move end of February. Does any one want to help? Free drinks included? Just approx. 11,000 kg lead to move? Great, thank you very much, I understand :-)
