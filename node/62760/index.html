  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi crowd - my first post here!

I'm Frane, 30, and I live in Slovenia, Europe - I was sent here by a co-worker of mine - she's a great fan of the site. So, here's my humble "cry for help" :) :

After few years of being employed, I decided to finnaly start with my private business as well. Mostly, I m preoccupied with webdesign but also work in the fields of illustration, logo creation and print design. So, in order to keep things neat, I need to come up with a good logo solution that will (hopefully successfully) represent me. Since I go by the nickname "Gofra" on most of the sites I decided to stick with this as my "brand" name (It's made of two parts of my first and last name - "GO" from Gorjanc < my last name and "FRA" from Frane < first three letters of my first name). Now, I've been thinkig of a solution in shape of a "fg" or "gf" logo and have also drawn some examples allready (will scan later in the evening) but what I would really love to see is some examples of ligatures.

So if anyone knows about examples, please - I'd be thankfull!
Also, if someone knows or suggest better ideas on resolving this issue, I'd appreaciate it a lot!

Thanks for your help!

Not a ligature but 'gf' in Grotext <a href="http://www.kltf.de/stuff/gf_in_KLTFGrotext.jpg" target="_blank">join like this</a>. Another decision to make is whether you go by Gofra (= 'gf') or by your real name (= 'fg'). The latter would allow, depending on the design of the letters, that the f reaches out above the g and g reaches out below the f. Perhaps it makes more sense if you post what you have, and then the crowd can tell which solutions are possible and which are not.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)</div>

Well, I'd rather go for "gf" since my "brand" name is Gofras...
Anyway, here are some quick sketches I did:

I've taken the "second" line further on...the result is here:

[[http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3450/3989028761_7a460e0ef7_o.jpg]]

The first one in second line (the most left one) looks a bit simmilar svastika and I dont find it that likeable but decided to put in in there just for the purpose of comparation.

Again - comments most welcome!

Maybe a swoosh wouldn't work, but there are other less hackneyed graphic shapes that might help you build your logo.</div>

Now, I'm not that worried that some people might not that read that as FG. What worries me more is if this cubic form is suitable for representing someone that doesn't really do 3D, but graphics only. Once again, i'd be glad to hear from you!

Oh and of course, I need to choose correct colours and define contrasts better. Maybe I'll do an example with a wireframe (semi transparent or not transparent at all) as well. Perhaps a different angle (maybe even a real perspective) might work better too...

That's not a criticism, just my personal reaction! Consequently, I am going to ask, do you aim to be associated with that history?

I do not think having a 3D logo implies that you do animated 3D graphics :)</div>

Its just that I've seen a bit too many "fancy" logos with serif fonts...My aims here would be recognition, accessibility, versatility. I would also like clients to think of me as reliable, credible and effective. Thats my philosophy in short :)

I'm currently working on other versions as well and when I'm done, I will start with integration with type ("Gofras graphic design" or simply "Gofras").

The F is instantly visible, but you have to wait for the G to appear. It is a bit like the arrow in the FedEx logo. Once you see it (or it is pointed out to you) you never forget it, and see it every time you see the logo.

BTW, this is an excellent example of logo design development. Would you mind if I used your images in a class I hope to be building in a year or two?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok people - after I've been told by many, that the logo really works well, I've decided to go for it. Now I'm working on the type part which would cosist of my "name" and "description". I'm searching for a nice looking font to go together with the logo. I think something calssic and light would work well - like Frutiger here in example: 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_real_4255.gif]

How does that seem to you? Mind you, I haven't got the font yet (yet to buy one) - this is just a printscreen of samples I made on fonts.com, so kerning and spacing is yet to be optimised. Should I keep this font or rather try something else?

Again, your comments are most welcome!

Thank you!
