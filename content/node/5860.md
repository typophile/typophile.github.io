  body: It has some similarity to Einhorn &#40;attached&#41; and a few other vertical
    scripts, like Lakeshore Drive and Deftone Stylus, that are shown in Part 7 of
    the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg1.html" target="_blank">Script
    Font ID Guide</a>, but it doesn&#39;t appear to match anything I have collected
    there. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41822.gif" alt="Einhorn

  body: Perhaps a bit closer &#40;but still not it&#41; would be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/speedway-sg/bold/testdrive.html?s=Marshmallow&amp;p=24"
    target="_blank"> Speedway SG-Bold</a>. <BR> <BR>Is the sample image from label
    or wrapper that might predate digital <BR>fonts, by any chance?
