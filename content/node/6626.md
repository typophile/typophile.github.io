body: Greetings all. I&#39;ve been asked to replicate this card, and I&#39;m trying
  to pin down the fonts. The DeVinne is easy to recognize, and I think the first line
  is Grant Antique, but I wanted to get a second opinion. If I&#39;m right, does anyone
  know where I can get it? Letterhead Fonts offers a version, but it has no lowercase.
  Solotype doesn&#39;t have it in digital form that I know of. If it&#39;s unavailable,
  does anyone have a similar font to recommend?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48688.jpg"

  body: There&#39;s one very similar to it in Photo-Lettering&#39;s <i>Alphabet Thesaurus
    Vol. 2</i> called Xenotype 3719. Not that it would be much help in this case.
    If you need to reproduce these exact characters, your best bet might be to redraw
    the just the ones you need based on this scan. The cent sign looks like it&#39;s
    a &#34;c&#34; from a different font.

    target=_top>Luc Devroye Site</a> &#40;scroll down to Doverpress&#41; Grant Antique
    <BR>is in the  Dover&#39;s <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/doverpublications/0486999564.html"
    target=_top>Victorian Display Fonts CD</a>, and if you zoom to the cover you&#39;ll
    see it in the second line. <BR>The question is if it comes with lowercase, maybe.
    Why don&#39;t you send them an e-mail?

  body: The Dover Victorian font book/cd font may very well have the lowercase. I
    found <a href="http://store.doverpublications.com/0486999599.html" target="_blank">this</a>
    on the Dover site. If you click to get a close up of the cover, you will see they
    did the title of this book in Grant Antique, upper AND lowercase. Unfortunately,
    the Victorian font book doesn&#39;t seem to be on this site.

  body: Thanks very much for all the input. I was planning to use Denim for the third
    line &#34;Directions,&#34; and I think I&#39;ll take a chance on that Dover book/cd.
    If all else fails I can just create this one line based on the original. <BR>

  body: Just a follow-up, and wanted to thank Mike Freiman, who sent me email and
    pointed out two excellent digital versions of Grant Antique. The first is Sheridan
    Gothic by Spiece Graphics <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/sheridan-gothic-sg/"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/sheridan-gothic-sg/</a>
    <BR>The second is Refugio by Nick&#39;s Fonts <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/refugio-wbw/"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/refugio-wbw/</a> <BR>
    <BR>Here&#39;s the finished replica of the old card that started this thread.
    It&#39;s Sheridan Gothic from Spiece Graphics, my own version of DeVinne, FF Zapata,
    and Old Times American from Baseline Fonts.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48775.jpg"
