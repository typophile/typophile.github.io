body: "Hey everyone im working on a project that involves creating a typographic logo
  that consists of the site title and the slogan. I really love the way that Calluna
  works for the Site title, but im having a hard time coming up with a good font for
  the slogan.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://cl.ly/3i0g1H3J2b3X34332m1W\">Calluna + Museo
  Sans</a> is the best combonation ive been able to come up with...\r\n\r\nIf you
  think its necessary to use a font other than Calluna I'm definitely willing to switch,
  id just need a reccomendation.\r\n\r\nAlso if you would reccommend a different Layout
  id defenitely Consider it.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
