  body: "Which 'Victors Hand' do you mean? The one I have seen is not like this. (And
    is really and 'alias name' for 'Roel' from the old ClickArt Handwritten fonts
    collection.) \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I found it as something called <a href=\"http://www.liongraphics.com/LGLettering.htm\"
    target=\"new\">'Hand Script'</a>, but there are some misnamed fonts in this collection,
    so it's possible that 'Hand Script' is not the correct name. (Notice Victors Hand
    near the bottom of the page -- that is really 'Roel')\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: It's a Fontographer font I have called "Handwriting" which I'll look for an
    online sample of. It looks like a stroke has been added though.
