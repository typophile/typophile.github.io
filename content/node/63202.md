body: "Hey there. I received a question about one of my fonts that I do not understand
  and hope someone here can help. This is the email I got:\r\n\r\nHello Michael,\r\nFirst,
  I'd like to thank you very much for the great typefaces you\r\ncontinue to share.
  It really is appreciated. Second, I'd like to let\r\nyou know about a problem I
  have encountered using 3Dumb, I believe it\r\nrelates to a Windows bug, that is
  having trouble reading the data in\r\nyour font file. I am trying to embed 3Dumb
  onto a site using CSS, the\r\ntechnique works fine in the Safari browser, and Firefox
  on Mac, but in\r\nFirefox on Windows, and IE the font isn't rendered.\r\n\r\nHere
  is my test case:\r\nhttp://christophermeyers.name/fonttest/\r\n\r\nAfter reading
  this:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__open__&id=517770\r\nmy
  best guess is it has to do with the use of a numerical value in the\r\nname table.\r\n\r\nIf
  you have any thoughts on this or would be able to re-release that\r\nfont using
  a different value in the name table, I would greatly\r\nappreciate it.\r\n\r\nAny
  idea what he is talking about or how to fix this? I use FontLab Studio.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Tired late night thoughts:\r\n\r\nOpen FLS5's <em>FontInfo</em>, go through
    all pages, and whenever the name \"3Dumb\" appears, exchange it by \"ThreeDumb\".
    (Especially in the font name fields on the first <em>FontInfo > Names and Copyright</em>
    page.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps you also need to change <em>FontInfo > Names and Copyright
    > Embedding</em> to \"Embedding/Everything is allowed\". Don't remember, but perhaps
    the font's current setting does not allow use with @font-face in Windows."

  body: "Maybe I'm missing something here. But as far as I understand, the font should
    not work with @font-face in IE. IE only uses EOT fonts with the @font-face call,
    and from the email I assume the user only has the OTF (or ttf) version of the
    font? \r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: Hello Jason, the test site links to both .ttf and .eot, and according to the
    description the problem occurs in FF/Windows too which relies on .ttfs, so there
    is more to it than a missing or buggy .eot. Karsten

  body: "The problem is in the family/full names of your font, the family name is
    '3Dumb' with a capitalized 'D' and the fullname is '3dumb' with a lowercase 'd'.
    \ Believe it or not, this is enough to cause the t2embed library used to load
    fonts on Windows to burp.  Firefox 3.5, Safari and IE all use this library but
    Safari falls back to rewriting the name table and using a low-level font loading
    API when the load using the t2embed library fails.  Similar logic has been added
    for Firefox 3.6.\r\n\r\nTo avoid problems with the t2embed library on Windows:\r\n\r\n1.
    Make sure the fullname includes a precise match of the family name (e.g. family
    = \"Bountiful Bongo\", fullname = \"Bountiful Bongo Bold\" and not fullname =
    \"bountiful bongo bold\" or fullname = \"BountifulBongo Bold\").\r\n\r\n2. Make
    sure no name table record (including the license record) is longer than 2500 characters.
    \ Yes, this officially sucks...\r\n\r\nFor your font, the simple solution is rename
    '3dumb' to '3Dumb' in your name table records and everything should be groovy.\r\n\r\nJohn

    I made, and obviously I was sloppy. I really appreciate your time.
