  body: "This dates from 1954, yes? \r\n\r\nSo far, no hits on any of the databases,
    which means it's either never been digitized or was hand-drawn. A quick look at
    the 1954 Intertype Fotosetter catalog didn't turn up anything, either.\r\n\r\nBut
    I suspect someone else on this board may have more knowledge. Please keep checking
    back."

  body: "Hand-lettered in 1954. This is near the end of about two decates when this
    style of lettering was popular. Looks like it was made by a broad nib pen rather
    than a brush, has a thick and thin/high contrast character, has a crisp, precise
    appearance, and is regular in spacing and slope. \r\nSo what digital fonts meet
    the job description.\r\nNone completely but here are a few that are part way there.\r\n\r\nRobert
    Hunter Middleton's Coronet Bold from 1927 http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/coronet/\r\n\r\nQuick,
    \ designed by Howard Allen Trafton in 1933. Bauer sold it as Quick in Germany,
    as Trafton Script in the US, and as Etoile in France.  http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/31841/quick
    Versions: Parfum http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rmu/parfum/ Pacific Script http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/pacific-script/
    Trafton Script [Edited: Deleted link to House Of Type version of Trafton Script.]
    \ There was also a version from Solotype with the name Trafton Script but I can't
    find it.\r\n\r\nAnother 1930s design: Troubadour http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rmu/troubadour-pro/
    Digitized by Ralph M. Unger who also did other similar fonts like Carla and Ronde.\r\n\r\nDuktus
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/eurotypo/duktus/\r\n\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    designed by Sol Hess in 1940 for the Lanston Monotype Company  Digital version
    as Swizzle Script by Harold Lohner http://www.fontbros.com/families/swizzle-script/styles/regular\r\nPerhaps
    the best substitute so far.\r\nDon"
