  some time. Trying to gather tips and any other helpful info that will help me with
  my design work. I am self taught and I'm still working on a lot of things, one of
  which is lettering. I am here to ask for some assistance with a current design I
  am working on, whether that assistance be constructive criticism, hate or even a
  simple \"I like it\".  any thoughts, ideas or opinions will prove helpful at this
  point. As of now I've got two separate ideas that are very similar but have one

    body: Mostly just for practice. I'm working towards something that will eventually
      be used on a couple of hats for myself. With that being said and it being representative
      of me and my work I would like to make sure that it is  as good looking as it
      can be.  I appreciate the help Tim. any other ideas as to what might possibly
      make it look more complete/smooth?
