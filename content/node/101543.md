    text font?\r\n\r\nAnd something important: the more fonts you use the less people
    will remember what you look like. You can occasionally use different fonts, but
    make sure to limit yourself to 2-3 fonts for like 90% of your text.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Oh, this is just for different food recipe designs. Some may have a more
    serious type style, some more whimsical, etc so depending on the recipe we want
    to post we'll use a typestyle that matches well with the flavor of the dish or
    juice recipe. Our logotype and copy however are always the same fonts :)\r\n\r\nThanks
    much,\r\n\r\nChris"
