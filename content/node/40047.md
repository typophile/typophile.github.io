  body: "M N W look out of place and look too heavy.\r\nR and K legs to relate more.\r\nI
    would also have tried to balance the widths of the H N U characters.\r\nThe LJ
    combination in LJUNBERG looks a tricky one, particularly from a distance.\r\nGenerally
    spacing needs some work and attention.\r\n\r\nMalcolm"

    the bat, the Y seems a bit tall, the Z falls a touch to the left, and the flick
    on the U seems arbitrary. The X is way too wide. The W looks like a reflection
    of the M?"

  body: by tall, I meant that the join in the two diagonals is uncomfortably high.

  body: "Hi Tom,\r\n\r\n<em>Legible from a distance?</em>\r\nyep\r\n\r\n<em>Even colour?</em>\r\nN,
    Y and W too heavy, A slightly heavy, M functional but lacks stylistic integration\r\n\r\n<em>Any
    strokes look too fat or thin compared to the rest?</em>\r\nN verticals and joints,
    joints at baseline of W\r\n\r\n<em>Do any curves look strange?</em>\r\nnothing
    overtly strange, but \"wierd is good\" in the sense that a lot more can be done
    with the curves you've got. There's a tameness and repetition that leaves a feeling
    you are holding back something more interesting. For example, the asymmetric theme
    used on E, F, L could be applied to the curves of C, G, O, Q, P, R, S---a faint
    wiff of Revue.\r\n\r\n<em>Any letterforms \u2019out of place\u2019?</em>\r\nN
    structure/style and heaviness, same for W\r\n\r\n<em>What characters don\u2019t
    sit next to each other well?</em>\r\nneed to see more combinations, set words.
    N and W fail to integrate with most others.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    top 6!\r\n\r\nThanks for the input guys, I will be looking at sorting it out and
    then I will post back soon.\r\n\r\nThanks, Tom"

  body: "I agree with most of James' comments.  The W shouldn't be a mirror image
    of the M -- start from the V to build the W. And M and W are too dark.  What if
    the center point of the M didn't descend all the way to the baseline?  Take the
    diagonals from the Y and put them in the M. \r\n\r\nAlso, the 4 is too narrow.
    \r\n\r\nNow I want to see some lowercase.  :)\r\n\r\n-matt"
