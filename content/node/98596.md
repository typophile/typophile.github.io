  from about 1958 to 1969? The closest match I found so far (without inner stripes,
  of course) is Diamanti Diagonal EF Heavy.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! "

  body: Part of the mentioned inner stripes, it looks very generic to me. You could
    do the same using [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/|Avant-Garde
    Gothic Bold Oblique]] (I like the lower crossbar /A), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/|Futura
    Bold Oblique]], even [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/|Helvetica
    Black Oblique]] (created in 1957) could work.

  body: You just need to manually slant it more and may be squooshed it a bit. That's
    also why it is called a logotype ;)
