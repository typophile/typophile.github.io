  the comic sans (thank goodness, that's getting changed) but the Hobbit font. I can't
  seem to find it for download anywhere. The net's all full of [[Tengwar]] and runes
  instead when I search for \"hobbit font.\"\r\n\r\nIt can be a lookalike or something
  very similar, too.\r\n\r\nThanks for any leads..."

    always Hobbit. This was before the movies came out and innundated us with pretty
    elvish fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks, I'll look for Hobo."

  body: It's possible that there was a knockoff font called "Hobbit". <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1&totalrecords=5&searchby=&searchID=&searchletter=&searchstr=hobo&font_categories_checkbox=font_name_search&fontRendererText=Shields+%26+Shades">Hobo</a>
    is the original.

    body: In 1993 I bought a font pack from the SERIF company, and there is the font
      HOBBIT.TTF included - I still have it and sometimes use it. I actually prefer
      it to the HOBO font from Adobe.
