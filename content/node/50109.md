  body: I just needed a quick design to throw up on a coming soon page. So i do not
    have a lot of time to put into it. But i will need a finished design. So lets
    just say this is my finished design and let me know what you think. I can't tell
    if i like it or not.

  body: "Far too much contrast between the black \"The\" and \"At\" (which shouldn't
    have a capital \"A\" by the way) and the white of the rest of the text \u2014
    especially with the background gradient already washing out the white text. Use
    a flat background color and switch \"The\" and \"At\" to the dark beige of the
    \"For more information\" text color. \r\n\r\npenn"

  body: Having "The" and "at" bold and dark is calling too much attention to them.
    Whether you have added a stroke to them or not they look "fake" bold. They are
    all too big.

  body: lol. I think the clients are just going to use my temporary logo as the final,
    but either way I would still want my temporary work to be of high quality.

  body: "People are more than a little straightforward here; it's some sort of TP
    curse...or a bid for design-crowd popularity by being picky.\r\n\r\nYour design
    shows that you have a grasp of the general direction you want to take things.
    The overall color and feel are probably very close to appropriate for the circumstances.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing to watch out for is the level of decoration that's going on. You don't want
    different elements of the design to represent their own continents, with their
    own styles and customs. The gradients used are probably not subtle enough, and
    that may be hurting the unity here. Gradients are informed by real-life lighting,
    so be conscious of what sort of lighting your gradients represent. The most often
    encountered gradients in real-life lighting are barely perceptible from start
    to finish.\r\n\r\nOverall contrast is another thing to watch out for. Blacks and
    whites may be pulling your message apart.\r\n\r\nYou're on your way though."

  body: "I think Garage club needs to be more prominent over Granite bay, because
    the former is the head and the latter is the sub. Granite bay, for example, could
    be set in all caps and much smaller directly underneath Garage club.  You seem
    to be going for a upmarket, slightly old-world feel, so perhaps some real script,
    fine rules, centre alignment might lift it. \r\n\r\nThe whole thing also feels
    a bit slight, like it lacks contrast, maybe something in darker tones would feel
    a bit more confident. I would also lose the pshop/illustrator 3d effect."

  body: "I don't think the glow around Garage Clubs is helping your design. In fact,
    to me it weakens it. KOing the name of the company from a light tint makes it
    difficult to read and downplays it's importance. Having the word \"The\" in a
    dark tone against a light tint places the emphasis on the word \"The\".\r\n\r\nGo
    back and tweak the composition in black and white - no gradiations, no glows,
    no drop shadows. Set your heirarchies, finalize the type and composition, then
    determine what might need embellishing. \r\n\r\nAlso why the dull brown. Brown
    and garage don't say luxury at least not in their current state."
