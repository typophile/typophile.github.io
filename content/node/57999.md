  body: "Hi Daniel,\r\n\r\nI guess the reason why nobody came up with an answer so
    far is that this is either custom, or an obscure freebie.\r\nThe best match I
    could find is <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=pr_uncial&page=1&nb_ppp_old=50&text=MACKINTOSH&nb_ppp=50&psize=l&classt=alpha\">this
    ugly freefont</a>. Some details are strikingly similar. I don\u2019t think that
    font is an original design, but it seems to share the same source as the letters
    in your sample.\r\nIf you are looking for alternatives, I\u2019d suggest <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/solemnis/\">Solemnis</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?&q=uppsala&site=d&sample_text=Macintosh&sample_size=60\">Uppsala</a>.
    While they both are no direct match, they might work as high-quality alternatives
    from the genre of normalized uncialish typefaces.\r\nF"
