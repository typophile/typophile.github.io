  good with alot of letterspacing (space between letters) and kerning (decreased space
  between letters)? And that also looks good on packaging. \r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\n"

    you might mix a tightly-\uFB01tted proportionally spaced display \u201Ctypewriter\u201D
    style with a monowidth typewriter font for the open look. There is a good list
    of them at FontShop, IIRC."
