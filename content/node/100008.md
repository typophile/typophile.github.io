    OS font that's not on OSX, there's actually a way to buy many of those, thanks

    Ebrima.\r\n\r\nA little history:\r\nEbrima was designed to support a large number
    of African languages. The font contains characters for the Nko, Tifinagh, Vai
    and Osmanya writing scripts.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback everyone."
