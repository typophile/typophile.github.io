body: "hi,\r\n\r\ncoming from a manufacturing/architecture background rather than
  from the design side, i never got in touch with typography, so far. now i'm at the
  point, where i think about selling some of the furniture, that i have created over
  the years. i put together a first concept of a logo/brochure, but looked at the
  whole thing once too often and need some skilled advice. here are some of my thoughts,
  that are behind the logo and everyhting (no need to read it, but may explain what
  i wanted to do):\r\n\r\nthe logo:\r\nmy name, 'fertig', means something like 'done/finished'
  in german. i wanted to play with that and make it a statement, as i'm going to offer
  a finished product, a series of furniture, that reflects my ideas and rather pragmatic
  lifestyle. no custom orders wanted. hence, the period sign. as two dots in the logo
  looked too much and playful, i removed the tittle on the i. the claim should be
  self explanatory.\r\nchoosing a typeface was a bit of a problem, as none seems to
  offer a decent solution for an rt-ligature. some create a faux ligature when reducing
  the tracking, but that looked even worse to me, and i wanted to add some individual
  appearance to the standard font. as a result i came up with what you see, and am
  quite satisfied with it. \r\n\r\nthe brochure:\r\nthe two pages are printed on an
  a4 sheet, folded in half, and folded again into a z-booklet. i intentionally left
  2 pages blank to give it some more room, but have the feeling that the frontpage
  looks too empty. if i increase the size of the picture, i loose my alignment with
  the text. moving the text up, too, eliminates the headroom and makes it look squished
  to the top. further enlargment of the logo makes it too dark for my taste. comments?\r\n\r\nthe
  typeface:\r\ni wanted a clean and technical layout, but found futura to 70s and
  too harsh in its appearance. looking for a smoother, yet geometrical typeface, i
  soon stumbled upon avenir and found my match. \r\ni tried to combine it with other
  fonts, but jumping on the 5-typefaces-in-10-styles-train, that you often see online
  recently,  didn't really serve the purpose in my eyes.\r\nthe brochures will have
  individual colors for the different pieces of furniture, so in combination it gives
  you a nice palette that will lighten up the website. i'm thinking about a light
  gradient on the colored strips.\r\n\r\nthe problem:\r\ni think i overdid it with
  the cleanliness, to the point where it gets boring. unfortunately, i don't see a
  way of adding some more tone and personality to the whole thing. criticism, comments
  and suggestions are highly appreciated!\r\n\r\nsorry for that monster of a first
  post. looking forward to your opinions and ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\nbest,\r\nlukas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> i think i overdid it with the cleanliness, \r\n> to the point where it
    gets boring. \r\n\r\nI like layouts that show restraint and subtlety, but I think
    your layout goes a little too far in that direction, with the majority of the
    space on the pages being white space. Especially since you're talking about how
    much the cabinet holds, but are showing it using rather small photos.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    although I like the quirkiness of the copy, it needs some polishing. On page two
    you've got one long sentence with around 11 commas and semicolons. Are you using
    a professional copywriter? If not you might want to bring one into the project.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure I'm clear on how it folds. Could you post a simple sketch showing how it
    folds?"

  body: "thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\nabout the copy, it has not seen any work,
    yet .i just needed something and didn't want to use the lorem stuff.. 'tightening
    it up' sounds like what it needs. the elements feel lost on the pages. maybe i'll
    need to look at a couple more other designs to find out how.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FjDio7h.png\"
    alt=\"a4_folded\">\r\n\r\nthat's the way it folds. the inside, i intend to use
    for either a technical detail sketch that communicates dimensions etc, or for
    a personalized cover letter. might as well leave it blank. duplex printing it
    on a single a5 sheet is not an option, as it feels too fiddly in your hands. \r\n\r\nanother
    thing, that's bugging me, is the imprint. the size of the 'thank you' as well
    as the 'fine furniture' breaks the logic (or is it just me?). decreasing it looks
    strange, though. how about the size and spacing in general? i think the color
    of the copy is ok, but the headline a bit too large. what do you think?\r\n"

  body: "thanks for looking into this JamesM =).\r\n\r\nthey're all printed on the
    same page, as you can see in the document attached.\r\n\r\n i spent some time
    this evening, trying to develop a more lively layout, using the basic elements
    i already had. i also changed  the order of the text blocks, as i noticed that
    many people, whom i showed it to, opened it another way than i thought. it still
    has a lot of whitespace on the back, but i alread have an idea of what i'm going
    to use it for.\r\nall in all, i think, some parts really improved, but the logo
    is too large (maybe only half-sized in bottom corner?), the grey background could
    be replaced by full scale pictures etc. etc.... i didn't have the time to get
    those done today, though.. already quite late. \r\n\r\nbest,\r\nL.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/doc_001_003_brochure_cabinet_8_130708_5286.png]"

    \r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, you're printing on one side only and the brochure
    is folded to make the printing appear on both sides. Is that correct? I wouldn't
    do it that way as it'll look amateurish. Are you planning to print this yourself?
    \r\n\r\nIt should be printed on both sides, either using a 1/2-size sheet, or
    else print 2-up per page (like 2 fronts on one side and 2 backs on the other)
    and then cut them apart after printing. If you want the extra heft of a folded
    page, just use heavier weight paper instead. \r\n\r\nOr am I misunderstanding
    your diagram?\r\n"

  body: The area where the r meets the t has the slight illusion of being swollen,
    something like the bone effect (http://66.147.242.192/~operinan/2/2.3.2a/2.3.2.06.illusion.htm)
    but not quite. I think you might need to work on your curves there to get it opticlly
    straighter, perhaps narrow it a bit.

  body: "I agree with the above post, and I also think \"fine furniture\" isn't integrated
    with the rest of the logo as well as it could be. I would tighten the leading
    and also do something about the space between the tag line and the \"g\". This
    would help the logo feel more unified.\r\n\r\nYou might even consider changing
    the font of the tag line altogether. Personally, I think a contrasting font always
    looks better than using the same font. It's also somewhat awkward how the \"f\"
    in \"furniture\" and \"fine\" line up. Not only because of the visual repetition,
    but also because it's hard to tell if they're both left aligned. It looks as if
    \"fine furniture\" might be slightly indented, but I can't tell if it actually
    is or if it's an illusion.\r\n\r\nThe strength of this logo is that its simplicity
    is consistent with the clean, minimalist style of the brochure and the product.
    I also enjoy your solution with the period. It looks as if the dot on the \"i\"
    has been re-appropriated, which adds just enough playfulness to keep the logo
    from being bland in its simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that I notice about
    the brochure is that the image directs your eye *off* the page, by having the
    shelf sticking out \"point\" off to the right side. If you moved the image to
    the left side of the page, you could make the shelf \"point\" to the text. Then
    the reader's eyes would go directly to the right place (the copy).\r\n\r\nI think
    it would look nice if the paragraph were framed by the right angle created by
    the cabinet and the shelf. Then the image and the text would be integrated in
    an interesting way. I don't know if I'm getting the image across very well, so
    this is what I mean: imagine the text box sitting on top of the shelf. But instead
    of having the words actually touch the shelf, leave a wide margin (both on the
    left side of the text to separate it from the cabinet, and under the last line
    of text to separate it from the shelf). Let the image act as a frame for your
    body copy.\r\n\r\nOf course, you have to play around with that idea to see if
    it actually works. It seems like a good idea in my mind, but might not work very
    well on paper. It would also leave even more white space, but you could use that
    white space for more text and imagery. Though I get that you're going for a minimalist
    look, the brochure as is looks too empty, so you'll either have to add more content
    or use a more compact layout that you can fill with the content you have.\r\n\r\nHierarchy
    could be emphasized more. Your headings could stand to be a lot bigger. Don't
    be afraid to really exaggerate the differences between the heading and the body
    copy. This is what energizes a design, not to mention makes it easier to read.
    Again, contrasting fonts go a long way too. I recommend keeping the font you have
    for the heading, but blowing it up to a much bigger size, and using a contrasting
    font for the body copy. Maybe a serif font. And the all-lowercase motif doesn't
    really need to be carried over into the body text, because it makes the logo/headers
    look less distinct. And again, contrast is what really energizes a design.\r\n\r\nI
    hope this helps! If I sound super nit-picky, it's because I think even the best
    designs can always be improved."

    to me. no, you're not super picky. in fact, many people tend to say something
    nice, in order not to offend you, but i think criticism, inspiration and and continuous
    practise is what gets you to there in the end. unfortunately i haven't had much
    time to play around and bring up new ideas during the last two weeks, just wanted
    to say thank you at this point. i'll post an update once i'm a step further."

  body: "If it were me, I'd close up the space in the logo between the <em>r</em>
    and the <em>t</em>  by, in essense, removing the left side of the crossbar on
    the <em>t,</em> then butting the end of the r up against it. This would make a
    nice, well-proportioned ligature instead of having two separate glyphs simply
    smooshed together.\r\n\r\nAlso, about the <em>f</em>... Aesthetically, it matches
    everything else, but it, unfortunately, closely resembles the all-too-familiar
    Facebook <em>f.</em>"
