  body: Firstly thought it could have been [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2/viewfonts|Neutraface
    (2) Text Italic]] but the /e middle bar of your sample isn't slanted as Neutraface's.
    Very close though. So may be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/le-havre/|Le
    Havre]] comes closer...

  body: Le Havre comes pretty close it also lacks the slanted bar and a couple other
    characteristics. Thanks for the great effort though! I will call you "Apprentice
    to the Master Type Wizard".

  body: 'Definitely think it''s Neutraface 2 Text (Book) Italic. The /e with horizontal
    middle is the default one (tested using their online typesetter: http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2).
    The /e with the oblique middle bar should be the alternate (http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2/viewfonts).'

    a font, who says he/she doesn't want them to consult a forum to get the answer?

  body: Christopher Dean- you should not jump to conclusions. The other guy is my
    associate, we are working on a package re-design for a client. Swallow your pride.  Ryuk-
    thank you so much for your help! Here it goes ... you are a Master Type Wizard.
    Thanks again, this saved some valuable time.
