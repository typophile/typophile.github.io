    in choosing work, and according to Adam Roe &#40;an early top seller at T-26 back
    in the mid nineties&#41; they did not even bother responding in regards to his
    font submissions. <BR>On another note- show us your work,

  body: Looks great, but weird text in your PDF - is that &#39;running&#39; or &#39;rimming&#39;

    in abstractly endless but if it goes together with a melody, <BR>here that a concrete
    object pops up in front of your mind. <BR>Funny, how music has an effect... <BR>Drumming
    is extremely physical, very erotic as well, it awakes your body...  <BR>releases
    your senses... and even at its strongest it can calm you down,  <BR>awake your
    spirit... it puts you in contact of your innermost being, and it  <BR>unites people
    maybe more than any other type of music, it is such a basic  <BR>instinct, as
    it is the rhythm of body &amp; soul.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#40;c&#41; Tuija Tervo, 5
