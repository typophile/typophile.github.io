  from the teens (as in 1910-1920). \r\n\r\nI have several good books on design history
  (including Steven Heller's \"Graphic Style\" and \"Typology\" -- both of them great
  btw -- as well as Philip Meggs' book) but there seems to be this gap between late
  Victorian/Arts&Crafts and early Modernism in the 1920s. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm looking
  for the commercial \"vernacular\" design of American hotels, not the avant garde
  of European art/design movements of the time, which I'm assuming were in a completely
  different place.\r\n\t\r\nI'm guessing my resources are going to be limited, so
  I'm open to expanding the pool of sources to include restaurant graphics, matchbook
  covers, signage, advertising, etc. from the period.\r\n\r\nAny ideas anyone has
  for books, online resources, etc., would be really appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-Rob\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    won't be good books until they recognize the dominant role of Historicism in 20th
    century mass media, especially during the first three decades.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/biltmore_6327.jpg]"

  body: "An interesting tangent you might follow in this pursuit would be to look
    at the big ATF specimen books from the early 20th century: 1906, 1912, 1923. Probably
    also the big BB&S book from that period. To illustrate how types might be used,
    advertisements for businesses were included on many pages. The businesses were
    for the most part made-up, just as today many design students create businesses
    on which to base their identity projects. I'm sure there were hotel ads.\r\n\r\nSo
    it gets a bit fanciful, since these were not likely to be real businesses. But
    it may give a view of what was considered to be the \"way\" hotel ads were to
    look. & you'd probably find better composition than in the Biltmore ad Nick shows
    us.\r\n\r\nHave fun.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "<em>...better composition than in the Biltmore ad...</em>\r\n\r\nNothing
    wrong with the composition.\r\nI particularly like the way the block of small
    caps centres under the \"BILTMORE\" and the archway in the illustration.\r\nBut
    I guess you mean compositor composition, not layout composition.\r\nIn which case,
    I have to say--they even kerned the LT!\r\n\r\nHowever, although they were able
    to close up between \"w\" and \"Y\", because it's just a thin space, they weren't
    able to kern between \"Y\" and \"o\", and didn't bother to put a thinner space
    between ALL and THEATRES--but then, that's extremely small type.\r\n\"New York\"
    was a huge colour problem back in the days of metal."
