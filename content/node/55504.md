    \u2013 that one was much easier to read for me. I mostly have problems with that
    \"b\" (\"B\"?) in \"no prob\".\r\nBut all in all it's very fitting for certain
    job situations. :->"

  body: "Yeah, I will agree that it is difficult to read. I guess if I ever made the
    shirt it would be more of an inside joke, only you're the only one in the loop...\r\n\r\nAnd
    showing it to a few people, I've had people say \"go 2 hew\" and \"no prog\".
    Everyone is reading it quite different, as expected. It's not that big of a deal
    if it's a lost cause, but any comments on how to improve the legibility, without
    recycling the celtic style you see in a lot of ambigrams?\r\n\r\nThanks for the
    input, all."
