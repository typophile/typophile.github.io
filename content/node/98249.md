body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI read in a book \"Book Typography: A Designer's Manual\" that
  fractions near old style figures should be minimized if they seem to large. \r\n\r\nSo
  I think: isn't it possible with OT features? \r\n\r\nI could make additional sets
  of numerators and denominators - one.numr.osf etc. and fraction.osf that would be
  a little bit smaller to harmonize with lowercase glyphs.\r\n\r\nThan some changes
  to the frac feature should be made. \r\nHere's my frac (auto-generated from Glyphs)
  :\r\n<code>\r\nlookup FRAC {\r\n\tsub slash by fraction;\r\n} FRAC;\r\nlookup HOCH
  {\r\n\tsub [zero one two three four five six seven eight nine] by [zero.numr one.numr
  two.numr three.numr four.numr five.numr six.numr seven.numr eight.numr nine.numr];\r\n}
  HOCH;\r\nlookup TIEF {\r\n\tsub fraction [zero.numr one.numr two.numr three.numr
  four.numr five.numr six.numr seven.numr eight.numr nine.numr]' by [zero.dnom one.dnom
  two.dnom three.dnom four.dnom five.dnom six.dnom seven.dnom eight.dnom nine.dnom];\r\n\tsub
  [zero.dnom one.dnom two.dnom three.dnom four.dnom five.dnom six.dnom seven.dnom
  eight.dnom nine.dnom] [zero.numr one.numr two.numr three.numr four.numr five.numr
  six.numr seven.numr eight.numr nine.numr]' by [zero.dnom one.dnom two.dnom three.dnom
  four.dnom five.dnom six.dnom seven.dnom eight.dnom nine.dnom];\r\n} TIEF;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAnd
  my question is how to write such feature?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: I wouldn't make changes to the frac feature. Rather, I would order the frac
    feature lookups before the numeral style selection features (which is normally
    the case anyway), and then simply add mapping from the default numerator and denominator
    glyphs to the variant forms in the numeral style selection feature lookups. So,
    for example, you would add mappings of /one.numr/ to /one.numr.osf/ in the onum
    feature.

  body: "Ok. I did it. John, it came to my mind thanks to your tips :)\r\n\r\nIt turned
    out to be very simple. I just added old style glyphs (numerators, denominators,
    fraction and slash) and made some changes to the frac feature:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n\r\nlookup
    FRAC {\r\n\tsub <strong>[slash slash.osf] by [fraction fraction.osf] </strong>;\r\n}
    FRAC;\r\nlookup HOCH {\r\n\tsub [zero one two three four five six seven eight

    seven.numr eight.numr nine.numr];\r\n} HOCH;\r\nlookup TIEF {\r\n\tsub <strong>[fraction

  body: "Here\u2019s what I did in the Modern Suite.\r\n\r\nFirst, I made a set of
    quite small superiors and inferiors (because I have never liked these\u2014especially
    superiors for use in references\u2014to be too obtrusive).\r\nThen I made a set
    of numerators and denominators that were larger, for use as the default fraction
    style, with the default \uFB01gures, which are lining.\r\n\r\nTo change to the
    smaller size of fraction style, I included a change from \u201Cnumerator/denominator\u201D
    style to \u201Csuperior/inferior\u201D style in the Oldstyle \uFB01gures feature\u2014shown
    below in bold. (Making sure the Fraction feature came before the Oldstyle features
    in sequence.)\r\n\r\nThere is no need to include this change in the Fraction feature,
    as John has already mentioned.\r\n\r\n<code>feature onum { \r\n# Oldstyle Numerals\r\n
    \ sub @figs by @figs_onum_tnum;\r\n  sub @figs_lnum_pnum by @figs_onum_pnum;\r\n
    \  <strong> sub @figs_numr by @figs_sups;\r\nsub @figs_dnom by @figs_sinf;</strong>\r\n}
    onum;\r\n</code>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Numr_5497.png]"

  body: "Nick,\r\nYou are right, there is no need to change frac feature. I've removed
    changes and it works well. \r\nIn fact, my scenario is similar to yours except
    that I've created new glyphs for osf fractions instead of using inferiors and
    superiors. \r\nI work in Glyphs app so all glyphs with .osf suffix are automatically
    included in onum feature, so that approach was more elegant for me. \r\n\r\nThank
    You. \r\n "
