  me towards some worthwhile discussion on the interplay between these bits of software.\r\n\r\nI've
  just recently upgraded to both windows vista and adobe cs3, and have found that
  suitcase no longer plays nicely with T1 fonts in that environment.  I'm not exactly
  sure  where the problem is, just that the T1 fonts no longer activate.  It seems
  that several people have had this problem, but i can only find scraps of information
  about it or a solution.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help.\r\n"

    updates page]], but since I actually use CS2 and on a Mac, haven't been needing
    them. Might have missed an update?

    you running Suitcase 9.x or Suitcase 11? Suitcase 9.x has not been updated for
    Vista compatibility, although I can't recall exactly how it fails. When Suitcase
    11 for Windows was released, there were a few isolated cases where users had registry
    permissions set that prevented certain font types from activating. It wasn't a
    problem with default installs of Vista, and I don't know what caused it. I think
    that attempting to install any variation of ATM can also cause problems, and could
    potentially result in the behavior you're seeing.\r\n\r\n"
