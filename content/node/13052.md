  logo for my Dad's Windsurfing School. I'm pretty sure that the original logo was
  hand rendered (but I'm hoping not the type \u2013 Letraset maybe?) \u2013 probably
  in Vancouver BC in the early to mid 1970's. The logo was shared between my father's
  business and a related manufacturing company that lasted into the late 80's. The
  only surviving reproduction is a small sticker about 3 inches in diameter. This
  sample has been scanned from the sticker. I thought it might be Futura but the \"S\"
  does not look right. Any ideas folks?"

    But the 'S' is still slightly different, and, The 'S' in your sample is lovely,
    I may add.. :)</em>"

    you'll get pretty close, even the "S".
