  30+ years) and were looking for the best hands on workshop on the planet, where
  would you go? I've seen a few blog postings documenting these wonderful intensive
  weekend to weeks long type retreats. \r\n\r\nIs there a compendium of them somewhere?
  \ Does Typophile have a \"Worldwide Type Events\" calendar hidden away somewhere?"
