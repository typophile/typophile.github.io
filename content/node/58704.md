  font]] to use in an osx application.\r\n\r\nIt contains only the 26 standard English
  upper case letters.\r\n\r\nI drew the letters in illustrator and and imported the
  shapes into font forge (on osx leopard)\r\nI have tried to export my font in a number
  of formats, but font book doesn't like any of them. I've used font book's validate
  file option, which found no errors. But font book won't install the file.\r\n\r\nsome
  people have told me they are able to install the font, but absolutely nothing happens
  when I try to get font book to open it.\r\n\r\nany suggestions?\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\nMathew\r\n\r\n"

  body: Works for me. Are you actually saying "Open with Font Book" or just double
    clicking the otf icon? I think Font Forge automatically becomes the default application
    for all font formats on Leopard so, if you already have the font open in Font
    Forge, it might look like nothing is happening.
