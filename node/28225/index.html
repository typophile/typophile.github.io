		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi there, I am an English graphic designer working in Sweden. Just thought I would put in my 10 pence worth.</p>
<p>Mijlee is correct when he says that British typography can be a little more varied. I think that this has something to do with the fact that British desigh is very idea based. Each project is approached in a different way, some may call for illustrations, some may call for typographic solotions and so on.</p>
<p>Working in Sweden at the moment I find that Scandinavian design is very trend led. You tend to find a lot of similar work coming out different companies at certain points in time. The Scandinavians are very trend led in general, especially when it comes to Fashion and Architecture, this can also be said of graphic design. For instance, over the last year I have seen a tremendous amount of illustrative design come out of sweden, next year it could be something completely different but I asure you that many companies within Sweden will be doing similar things.</p>
<p>Then you have the Dutch and Swiss, both very different in the way they approach design, the Swiss, very precise and formal and very beautiful indeed. The dutch, very playful but they share the Swiss characteristics of form and function.</p>
<p>And then the Americans, a little less restrained and a little more open.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it has to do with the markets that you are working in. I have a friend in New York working, and he sometimes finds it hard to introduce his British style into the industry. The clients are either not ready for it or they just dont understand. But this happens everywhere, all around the world, and I think if you cross reference each countryies styles they will all overlap in some form or another.</p>
<p>But its very important within ones own climat to keep an underlying connection to their traditions. It make them who they are, but then there is also a need to break out of the box and adapt to other forms.</p>
<p>I still keep a very close connection to the ways I was taught at University in England, but I understand that I am working in Scandinavia and that calls for maybe a more simple way of working. The markets here can be quite small and so sometimes you have to play it safe, whilst still try to make a mark, it can be quite challenging sometimes.</p>
<p>Thats just my opinion, hope it sheds some light. I am sure you will get many more good opinions on this topic, we all approach things in different ways, if we didnt then it would be a pretty boring world.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a Swede who&rsquo;s worked in London (although that was a while ago, 98-99), I can agree with what Matt&rsquo;s saying, but I think it&rsquo;s mostly because Sweden&rsquo;s such a small country.</p>
<p>And also I think some of the fads are more client-driven than designer-driven.</p>
<p>Plus, most designers here have gone to the same few schools, and share a way of approaching things (but would never admit it).</p>
<p>That said, every time I go to London I marvel at the sheer creativity and talent you see in graphic design everywhere.</p>
