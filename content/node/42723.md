    has retro memorabilia all around the store. The type on the cover really caught

  body: "It looks vaguely familiar to me, but I can't place it. I also checked my
    library of film font catalogues, but no luck.\r\n\r\nIt seems odd that something

    Yet it looks like something that could exist as an non-custom font."
