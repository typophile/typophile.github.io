  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">FlashMX 2004 was released yesterday. It has several new features that will be of interest to makers or users of &#34;pixel&#34; fonts, fonts designed to overcome Flash&#39;s text anti-aliasing.  <BR> <BR>The most obvious thing is that there is now a button to turn antialiasing <i>off</i> for selected text. <BR> <BR>After playing around with the Mac version last night and this morning, I have discovered the following: <BR> <BR>- Pixel fonts, such as those from Atomic Media, work just as well as before, if not better. <BR> <BR>- It is no longer necessary to set horizontal and verticle text box coordinates to whole numbers to prevent &#34;blurring.&#34; The same goes for centered or flush right text and tracking, which used to be no-no&#39;s. <BR> <BR>- Pixel fonts may be embeded for use in &#34;dynamic&#34; or &#34;input&#34; text boxes with no ill effect. Earlier versions of Flash had a bug which caused such fonts to blur somewhat. The work-around was to set the quality level for the movie to &#34;low,&#34; but this caused <i>everything</i> in the movie to be aliased--not usually the desired effect. <BR> <BR>- In certain cases &#40;I&#39;m still testing this&#41;, Flash will use bitmap fonts when they exist. For example, my Anonymous font is a TrueType font with bitmaps embedded for 8, 9, 10, and 11 ppm. When these sizes are used, and antialiasing is turned off, the embedded bitmaps are used. <BR> <BR>- Even more amazing, Flash now appears to support bitmap fonts which <i>don&#39;t</i> have corresponding outline fonts. Again, I&#39;m still testing this. So far the results are encouraging, but inconsistent. <BR> <BR>- Although not bearing directly on pixel fonts, Macromedia seems to have fixed the bug which caused high-ascii character encoding to become scrambled when using PostScript fonts with Flash. <BR> <BR>All in all, it seems like the situation has improved drastically for people who want to use aliased text in Flash. It also appears that the situation has improved for font makers as well, giving us more flexibility in the way of format, and perhaps making some of the tricks that were necessary before obsolete. <BR> <BR>I will continue to try things out and report anything else I find. If anyone else has been doing the same, post your findings here.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The upper ascii characters won&#39;t work in my demo because only the basic stuff is embedded. Just as before, you have a choice of which characters to include. For the demo I only included the basic A-Z, a-z, numbers and puncuation--about 95 characters. If I get a chance, I&#39;ll do another one with more characters included. <BR> <BR>About the remaining questions: <BR>1. Aliasing always works. Apparently, Flash creates an internal bitmap font at the size requested, even if the source font has none. <BR>2. It does not appear to support grayscale fonts :-&#40; although they can be used as before with the antialiased setting. <BR>3. As I said, I had some luck with fonts that only have bitmaps, but so far the results are inconsistent. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it means the death of pixel fonts, but it does offer a larger range of solutions.

Did you make some with BitFonter? Assuming you did: So these fonts worked directly in the OS, but not Flash?</i> <BR> <BR>I deduced this from the fact that the &#34;grayscale&#34; fonts being produced for use with Flash depend on its normal antialiasing in order to work. When you turn aliasing on, you are defeating this feature, therefore the trick won&#39;t work. I haven&#39;t actually tested this hypothesis or anything, which is why I included the words &#34;appear to&#34; in my statement. Still, I would be surprised if I am wrong about this.  <BR> <BR>I have not tried using grayscale bitmap fonts made in BitFonter. I don&#39;t know if those work with Flash, but I&#39;m doubtful. In my demo, for example, the bitmap fonts only show up when aliasing is switched on. If you turn aliasing off, the bitmap fonts disappear. If there is an outline font, that&#39;s used. If not, the field goes blank. Flash simply ignores bitmap fonts unless aliasing is on, but that also forces the pixels to be only on or off. Also, from what I&#39;ve read &#40;see the link above again&#41;, it appears that Flash actually embeds bitmap objects rather than using the host OS&#39;s bitmap font facilities. Embedded outline fonts are handled similarly. They are not fonts so much as collections of outline objects like any other in the symbol library.  <BR> <BR>It might be worth a try, though. Just to be sure. <BR> <BR><i>&#62; grayscale fonts ... can be used as before with the antialiased setting.  <BR>  <BR>But that&#39;s just stuff rendered from [de-hinted] outlines, right?</i> <BR> <BR>Exactly. So you would still have the same problems if you try to use them for dynamic text as before.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, I tested it in FlashMX 2004 on OS X. Not surprisingly, since OS X doesn&#39;t support grayscale bitmap fonts, it didn&#39;t work. By that I mean the font does not display correctly at all, much less take advantage of the new aliasing feature.  <BR> <BR>&#40;OS 9 <i>does</i> support grayscale bitmap fonts, but FlashMX 2004 doesn&#39;t run on OS 9. The grayscale bitmap font I tried <i>does</i> show up in FlashMX, but disappears when you close out the text box or the movie is published.

As far as I know, Photoshop uses its own rendering engine for type, not the host OS&#39;s.
