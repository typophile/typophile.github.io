    work printed on a membership card, business card, or stitched onto a polo shirt?
    Or even just printed small on a busy page?\r\n\r\nThe tag line needs to come out
    of the logo\u2014otherwise there\u2019s just too much type. If the client absolutely
    demands it stay, then you\u2019re going to have to make a typographic logo\u2014there\u2019s
    just too much type to have it battling with dancing legs.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like it. #3 seems to work the best as it's not quite as busy as the rest,
    plus seems to offer itself to be tweaked into multiple configurations more easily.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think the legs in the air are dynamic, but I feel that it is a bit literal.
    The name is Legs in the air. And the image is legs in the air. What could you
    do that adds another dimention of interest to it or more information than just
    an illustration of what the words say? What if it conveyed more motion, showed
    team work, strength / empowerment developing over time, flexibility or ...?\r\n\r\nI
    agree with what James is saying about the configuration, as this looks more like
    an ad or illustration. When you see a bunch of logos together, say, on the back
    of a charity event T-Shirt or at the bottom of a poster, certain ones work because
    of their shape and proportions. For instance, if you sized down #1 or #2 to be
    on another application or with other logos, you would not be able to read the
    tag line at all. It can be a crazy shape, but generally if it fits inside some
    invisible boundaries, it will work on other applications such as business cards
    etc. better. \r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful. "

  body: "I totally agree with James and Gordon, what you need is just a typographic
    logo. You already have such a stunning typographic composition that you can use
    for the logo. Such as in version 2, apart from the legs illustration. The taglines
    placement should be flexible. But, you need to create a guidelines how to place
    the taglines, like the sizes comparison between the logo and the taglines, the
    line breaking in the taglines and the amount of spaces in between.  You could
    show them examples of the composition of the logo and the taglines, but remind
    them that it is depends on the applications. \r\n\r\nThe illustrations should
    be use as the brand elements only not part of the logo. In this way, you could
    use the illustrations applied into different applications in more elaborate way,
    not just restricted with certain composition.  \r\n\r\nJust keep it clean and
    simple for the logo.  I am sure you will create a stunning visual identity. \r\n\r\n"
