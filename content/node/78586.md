body: "I need help finding some san serif typefaces that look clean, sleek, \"modern,\"
  not too quirky, but must have some minimal character for some extra options for
  a fashion company.\r\n\r\nI've looked at some of the norm: Helvetica, DIN, Grotesque,
  Gills, Akkurat, Knockout, Interstate, etc., so maybe some newer typefaces or anything
  that is a little out of the ordinary would be great.\r\n\r\nI know this sounds a
  bit obnoxious and vague, but I would appreciate any help. Thanks in advanced!"
