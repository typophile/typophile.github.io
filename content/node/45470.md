body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am developing a new website for a hairdresser chain in Germany
  and I wonder if I'm on the right track. Please have a look at [[http://rub.designbits.de|the
  website]] and let me know what you think could be improved.\r\n\r\nThe logo was
  developed years ago by another company so there's no way of changing it. The typeface
  I chose is Helvetica but I'm not sure if it will render OK on Windows machines.
  I'm also keen to know if the price list is well formatted or if it should be given
  more structure.\r\n\r\nSorry for the site being in German only, but you should be
  able to get the gist of it.\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback!\r\n\r\n[[http://rub.designbits.de|Link

  body: "That logo is interesting! I like it a lot, although the ampersand could use
    some refinement.\r\n\r\nYour website looks a lot like a blog template. Maybe you
    could add the red from <a href=\"http://rub.designbits.de/images/banner_blankenese_buddha.jpg\">their
    wall</a> to your colour scheme to spice it up a bit. \r\n\r\nDefine typefaces
    in your css like this: {font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans;}\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The website is well designed but it can be more refined with better type
    treatment, like those navigation buttons on the right can be in a smaller fond
    size. \r\n\r\nColor wise is good (website).\r\n\r\nThe Price list is well formatted
    I believed.\r\n\r\nThe logo design doesn't seems to picture a salon to me, but
    it's fine since you're not changing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChriswong"

  body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback. Frank, I tried to color all links
    in red, but this doesn't look good on the pages where there's no red in the banner
    images. I also added three street maps which took me about a full day to develop
    (please let me know what you think).\r\n\r\nChris, I changed the font-size in
    the main menu from 1.4em to 1.3em. Does this improve things at all?\r\n\r\nAny
    further feedback is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere's the [[http://rolfundbernd.designbits.de|Link

    mean? Is the white not clear enough?\r\n\r\n@auminium: Good point actually. The
    only problem is that they have three salons, i.e. three different phone numbers.
    Where can I put them?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign Hamburg]]"

    them (caused by the indoor lighting). Here's an example of how the same image
    can look different with a different white balance.\r\n\r\nHope that helps? :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/banner_blankenese_waschen_6636.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/banner_blankenese_waschen2_5432.jpg]"
