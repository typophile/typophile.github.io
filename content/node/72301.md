body: "I'm working on the logo & wordmark for a company that will be based online
  (it's a music service) and aimed at Churches, primarily older and smaller high-churches,
  like Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Lutheran, etc.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm using Proxima
  Nova or Gotham in the mockups (anyone want to weigh in on why I should pick one
  over the other?), set in all-caps, but I'd like to see something that looks a tiny
  bit more traditional.  I'm thinking some slight serifs or something. Normally I'd
  try to solve this with a slab serif like Adele or PMN Caecilia, but it ends up looking
  too tough, and most serifs just look too boring to be used for an online music service.\r\n\r\nSo
  I'm looking for some suggestions...  Like I said, something current and contemporary
  is key, but with some sort of throwback to older styles, and preferably a wide letter
  form in the uppercase. It's be a plus if the typeface had some neat little quirk
  that gave it a personality as well.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if I stick with a serif,
  I also thought about Eigerdals (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/eigerdals/),
  the bold weight in particular... anyone have any thoughts on that font or the foundry?"

  body: "Hmmm... that's some risky business.  There's just too many weird letterforms
    in there. I've got two uppercase \"I\"s in the company name, and the Rotis \"I\"s
    look like \"1\"s.\r\n\r\nBesides, I thought that font was loathed around these
    parts! "

    seem to be much out there in this weird no-mans-land bridging a geometric sans
