  body: "It doesn't look like a font -you can see there are many variations for the
    same letter- but it has an overall consistency and it's possibly based on an existing
    font like, e.g. <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/|TradeGothic
    Bold Condensed]]</strong>\r\n\r\n"
