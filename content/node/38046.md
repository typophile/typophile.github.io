body: "Hi all!\r\nI'm thinking in develop a new typeface.\r\nAfter some reasearch
  and studies I found in an old Portuguese Pharmacie lettering (60/70's). Quiet nice
  and decided to do a \"similar\" typeface with some personal adjustments and \"feelings\".\r\nBut
  since the ideia from an lettering I dont want to waste my time in develop something
  that already exist (and there is a lot of typefaces outhere). \r\nOnce again I added
  something personal but I want to know (from your expertise) if there is something
  like the letters that I designed.\r\nIts just a first studie. Any ideias/critics
  welcome.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amarantino2_5634.jpg]"

    good. I like it (and I'm going to buy Milk soon).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Milkmood_3510.jpg]"

    but don't let that prevent you from pursuing something similar.

  body: "Thats for the comments!\r\nYes, its similar in style to Hubert Jocham\u2019s
    Milk...didn't know thst typeface\r\nBut like \"both\" of you said \"don\u2019t
    let that prevent you from pursuing something similar\" and in fact I already had
    designed some letters that are quiet diferent. That a look and give me your feedback.\r\n\r\nAnother
    interesting point I could ask now is: I'm design the letter in my favorite drawing
    tool (freehand). Already made some search about the best way (price/quality) in
    software to produce fonts. Is FontForge a good soft? I dont want to spend money
    in a software, like FontLab Studio or Fontographer that I will use a couple of
    times...\r\n\r\nThanks for the input.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font1_5568.jpg]"
