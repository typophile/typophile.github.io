body: I&#39;m making a font that has both the Latin characters and Greek characters
  &#40;including Greek extended&#41;. The rho has a tail, so I need to make a ligature
  for a rho following a zeta, xi, and chi. Making the glyphs is not the problem. <BR>
  <BR>No matter how I put these ligatures in the &#42;liga&#42; feature in FontLab,
  it won&#39;t compile. Obviously, I&#39;m doing something wrong -- can anyone tell
  me the proper form? <BR> <BR>Oh yes, what is the proper name for a swash small-cap
  R? R.scswash? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Charles

  body: 'You don&#39;t need the slashes in this context: <BR> <BR> sub uni03B6 uni03C1
    by zeta_rho;  <BR> <BR>You only need the slashes when entering glyph names in
    preview text boxes, and then they should be / not \. <BR> <BR>The backslash is
    only used for actual Unicode values, e.g. \03B6, again in preview text boxes.
    <BR> <BR>Try dropping the slashes from your feature code and see if it compiles.'
