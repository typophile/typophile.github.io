  looking for this font for a friend, but I cannot find it anywhere, and I'm certainly
  a beginner when dealing with fonts. I've looked through all default fonts in LibreOffice
  Writer, and I've tried the standard automatic font detectors like whatfontis and
  What the Font, but none of the automated systems have produced anything useful.
  I'm sure it is a simple font, but I can't seem to find it anywhere. Another image:

  \r\n\r\nHere is the source video: http://youtu.be/J7eSdXLmj9A?t=1m58s\r\n1:58 is
  the first time the shirt appears in the video, and appears throughout the video
  at different angles, starting at 2:15. Video owned by Red Letter Media.\r\n\r\nAny
  help is appreciated, and thank you for any suggestions."

    could do the job. I like also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/kyle-wayne-benson/national-champion|National
    Champion]], better designed but some earmarks of your sample are absent and it
    doesn''t have this vintage/amateur (inconsistent x-width + absence of kerning/spacing).
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/player|Player]] Bold (to get serifed
    /E crossbar) is another alternative but less convincing.'

    body: Thank you for your help. I decided to go with Freshman, as it looked the
      closest and was free. To compensate for the character spacing, I simply formatted
      it to have 8 pt. expanded spacing, and it looks darn near perfect. Thanks again!
