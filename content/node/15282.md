body: "Good morning,\r\n\r\nFor the reasons of comparison and reflecting on the subject,
  I am looking for good (or for that matter also bad) primers of a typesetting of
  a logotype (or some kind of a phrase), consisting of three or more words (just a
  \"out of context\" sentence won't do, though). Think of a logotype with three or
  more words. Those are probably rare... And I can't think of any I might know myself...\r\n\r\nAny
  help appreciated a lot.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlexey"
