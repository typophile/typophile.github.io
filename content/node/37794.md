  has the rounded ends, not the sharp serifs. It isn't a Century because the \"C\"
  has serifs on top and bottom. I'm stumped. Anyone recognize this? (sorry for the
  rough example)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cricht_4717.gif]"

  body: "Hard to tell anything by this fax-resolution sample. But I don\u2019t think
    it\u2019s a Bodoni because the serifs seem too heavy and not straight-line shaped
    and the serifs on the cap C point inwards instead of being perfectly vertical."
