I chose to redesign an article from Glamour mag about breaking up a friendship, but we don't have to adhere to the style of Glamour at all. That's why I considered doing something like the above example because I want it to have edge and attitude.

Try, even if    <BR>you think it is boring, a more traditional, structured     <BR>and formal layout. The pay back will be ten fold for     <BR>building upon a foundation of solid structure. After     <BR>you have studied strict layout you will find that you     <BR>will be able to create an ad like the one above with     <BR>more understanding of what it is you are doing.     <BR>Perhaps you can even insert visual jokes at that point.    <BR>    <BR>I am sure you have heard it before, but the rules have     <BR>to learned before they can be broken.  (This is a     <BR>generalization really. Instinct is also very important.)    <BR>    <BR>But again, challenge yourself a bit more and     <BR>perhaps even try a design style that you hate.    <BR>I think what you learn will be worth your suffering.    <BR>    <BR>This link  would be worth checking out.  <BR><a href="http://www.imon.org/mueller-brockmann/">http://www.imon.org/mueller-brockmann/</a> <BR>  <BR>-sean michael    <BR>    <BR>Oh yea, whatever you choose to do, just use square    <BR>textboxes.

		<div class="commentbody">Cheryl, is that example one of David Carson's? As a student at art school (very recently!), I was quite excited and inspired by the work of David Carson. He managed to make typographic layouts into beautiful paintings. My views about typographic design might have changed since then, but I still appreciate his work from that period very much; it was a refreshing experiment that broke away from the minimal and grided layouts. He once said &quot;don't mistake legibility for communication&quot;. But I think legibility is a requirement for the basic function of typography: type is a carrier of textual information. Type ceases to be type as soon as that linguistic function is lost. David Carson's deconstructive typography was painting. It communicates at a different level from what we think of as traditional typography.   <BR>   <BR>Now, do layouts have to be 'deconstructive' in order to be 'emotional'? Not at all, I think. Emotion could be communicated in many different ways, through the use of space, sizes, colours, typefaces, weights.   <BR>   <BR>It's interesting to see that deconstructive type is not actually that easy to make on the computer! Modern computer software were made to be grid-friendly! And we are conditioned to design accordingly. It's interesting&hellip;    <BR>   <BR>Simply set to print with tiling in Quark on your A4 printer.</div>

Tell us what you think of the site.  Although it seems this kind of typography; a la David Carson etc, is dead in some of your eyes? *cries* ! 'Cause some of my friends are still trying this stuff out.  <BR> <BR>Where do you think magazine design is heading in terms of style, grids n all? Does anyone know any good examples online of grids and/or double page spreads?  <BR> <BR>Keith, the tiling worked! Cheeeers!
