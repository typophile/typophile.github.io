  body: You'll need to explain what you mean by 'custom character map'. FontLab provides
    a number of different options for encoding a font, and which is relevant depends
    on a number of factors including the format of the font. What is it that you are
    trying to achieve?

  body: "I have made some 'fake' codepages for FontLab just to put similar characters
    side by side and work on them. For that, I simply copied a codepage from codpages
    folder of FontLab and changed its name and changed the codes to those I wanted
    to put together... it takes time!\r\nNote that this was never intended to affect
    the font encoding process."

  body: That's a really complex way to achieve that goal, Behnam. You could just view
    in Glyph Mode and drag the glyphs you want adjacent next to each other in the
    glyph order. Or you could make a custom name based layout (.enc) file, which is
    easier to edit than a codepage.

  body: Well, I use them for drag and drop and other stuff too (comparing fonts, checking
    for missing glyph etc.). But you are quite right. My technics leave something
    to be desired! You haven't heard anything about my technics yet! One day I will
    write a book called 'How I made fonts'. That will be a classic!

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nWhat about editing an existing encoding like Mac OS Roman
    in 'Index Mode' (moving manually the glyphs and/or eventually creating or re-encoding
    them) and when you are happy with the result, you chose the command 'Save encoding'.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nRamiro."

  body: "The easy way for the full set is to open the enc file in a text editor and
    reorder the glyphs as you would like. You can also use a spreadsheet like Excel
    where you can put lists next to eachother as columns and drag and drop things
    around. Be sure to rename your file afterwards.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Yes, glyph = index mode. This exposes the Glyph ID order of glyphs in the
    font, as distinct from an name, encoding or codepage order.
