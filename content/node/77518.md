    that font the first result was a free pirated version. Bit of a worry. '

  body: Nope, Mandatory is still a K-Type freebie. I still don't know if they're redistributable.

    pdf</a> shows the letters. Have a feeling there may have been some comments about
    the font not being designed by a type designer back in the day, someone remind
    me.\r\n\r\nYou could also do a search on Charles Wright."
