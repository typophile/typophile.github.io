    Plus</a> (no condensed tho)\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualities you like best about
    Monitor? The large x-height? No change in stroke width? Simplicity? Schoolbook
    'g' and 'y'? Typewriter serifed 'i' and 'l'?"

  body: "Thank you Stephen. These are all worthy alternatives. It's hard for me to
    put my finger on it as regards to Monitor. Now that you point out some subtleties,
    I guess it's really a combination of all those things \u2013 plus the fact I like
    it's overall 'feel' and they way it renders on screen. I only wish it had small
    caps."

    It's squareness will suit the screen well.

    for this project. Thing is, I might be able to give up small caps for Monitor's
    unique flavor.\r\n\r\n -t"

  body: 'Tim, you might want to contact Our Type to see if they have any development
    versions of Monitor with in-built small caps. In my experience, many foundries
    often have beta versions of things laying about on their hard drives, and they''re
    happy for a paying beta-tester. '

    body: "Hi Chester,\r\n\r\nOur Type offered to build Monitor small caps, but the
      price was prohibitive. Nearly as much as the entire family of Monitor & Monitor
      Condensed for one weight; If I understood correctly.\r\n\r\n -t"

    have Monitor Small Caps waiting in the wings after all. But ain't it nice to know
    that they're willing to make it for you?"

  body: "Stephen,\r\n\r\nWow. Corpid is about the best match I've seen. Could work.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nOur
    Type has generously offered to provide small caps of Monitor (in time) If I purchase
    the ENTIRE family (regular and condensed). <em>Very</em> tempting, I'm saving
    my pennies."
