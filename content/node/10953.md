body: After reading a post about trouble with referenced characters in FOG on X in
  Classic mode I decided to test this myself. <BR> <BR>Sure enough FOG freezes when
  I attempt to move a referenced character via arrow keys or mouse. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately
  this is detrimental to being able to build fonts and I am at a loss for a workaround.
  I don&#39;t have the ability to boot in Classic mode since I&#39;m at 10.2.5 on
  my OS X Mac. <BR> <BR>Joe, can your brother leak that Classic bootable hack that
  Apple has? <BR> <BR>Mark, any thoughts? <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: I&#39;ve already discovered from Jim&#39;s forum that there isn&#39;t a fix
    for it. I was hoping other folks had alternate workarounds for it. <BR> <BR>So
    far I have surmized I could retrofit my machine with the ability to boot in Classic
    mode by replacing the system software with an older version. <BR> <BR>OR <BR>
    <BR>I could find some way to share the monitor of my new CPU with my old box &#40;ala
    Remote Desktop&#41; but it&#39;s painfully slow. <BR> <BR>OR <BR> <BR>Do all my
    FOG work on my old computer! <BR> <BR>The problem is due to my time constraints
    right now, I don&#39;t have the time to meet the learning curve of trying to figure
    out how to do FOG things in Font Lab. My primary reason to jump to OS X was for
    Font Lab so I&#39;ll eventually make the leap. <BR> <BR>I should have saved my
    pennies for a new monitor instead of a new computer . . . Sheesh! <BR> <BR>Stuart

  body: I haven&#39;t been able to pin my brother down about booting <BR>into classic
    from Jaguar. <BR> <BR>In general though, it&#39;s all about your workflow. If
    your  <BR>workflow requires OS 9 in any critical piece of your process,  <BR>you
    should wait to move to OS X when you can upgrade  <BR>everything at once. &#40;For
    most people that&#39;s a major outlay.&#41; <BR> <BR>Is your alternative is to
    stick to your OS 9-only workflow?

  body: Unfortunately my workflow will now require me to do all my drawing in Illustrator
    on my new X machine with a super crisp monitor and going back to my old 9500 to
    do all the FOG work on my blurry old monitor. <BR> <BR>There isn&#39;t a decent
    solution to this other than to repartiiton the X machine or find that bootable
    Classic hack so I can run both OSs on one machine. <BR> <BR>I appreciate you taking
    the time to see what your bro can find out. As I mentioned earlier, it&#39;s not
    so much that I&#39;m resistant to Font Lab, it&#39;s just that I can maneuver
    in FOG so much quicker and I have my workflow based around that application. <BR>
    <BR>Please post as soon as you find something out! <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: Stuart, I don&#39;t understand why you can&#39;t boot into OS 9. This facility
    was not removed in 10.2.5. Unless you bought one of the newest machines which
    were released just this year, you should be able to do it. Just go to System Preferences
    &#62; Startup Disk, select the OS 9 System folder and restart. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t
    forget that you should use the PPC version of FOG in OS 9.

  body: As far as I know, that model should be able to boot into OS 9. I believe the
    models that can&#39;t are the new laptops and towers with Firewire 800. Also,
    you should be able to boot from an external Firewire drive using the same Startup
    Drive control panel &#40;assuming it has a valid system on it&#41;.

  body: Hi Stuart, can&#39;t you just do all the the regular characters in Classic
    mode,  <BR>and then do the diacritcis and other refence charters on you 9500.  <BR>&#40;And
    maybe get a better monitor, they are cheap these days.&#41; <BR>Then move back
    to Classic to do the final kerning and spacing?. <BR>That&#39;s the work flow
    I&#39;ve been having since I upgraded <BR>to OSX in January.   <BR> <BR>Another
    tip that I got from this   <BR>forum is to speed up fog a little by choosing 1000nds
    of colors instead of millions. <BR> <BR>Anyone know more about the OSX robofog
    that there was romours about? <BR>

  body: OSX Robofog?  <BR>It sure would be nice. The LettError folks have however
    switched to Fontlab so that might be the end of things.
