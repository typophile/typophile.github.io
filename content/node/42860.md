  manor house, turned B&B for scrapbookers. She wants embellishments, but not behind
  the logo. She wants a Victorian feel, but not too fancy. I feel it may be too simple
  . . . please help!\r\n"

  body: "I would not include the URL in the logo for the simple reason of size. Once
    this logo is used small that URL will look more like a smudge. \r\n\r\nThey typeface
    used for \"The\" and the arabesques work together, but I don't think they work
    with the rigidity of Caslon Openface. I do like the slight alteration you made
    in the o. \r\n\r\nThe word \"The\" is crammed into that space too. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Any recommendations for a font that is a little more fluid (less rigid) but
    still legible? If I search for Victorian, they are too fancy. It needs to be classic
    without being too stiff.

  body: "I like it too, especially the \"The\". \r\nI think this it is not too simple.
    If you want more embellishments perhaps suggest some patterns to go along with
    the colours as part of the overall art direction. \r\n\r\nI like the face you
    are using for \"Scrapbook Manor\" also as it contrasts with the fluidity of the
    \"the\". \r\n\r\nAre the grey glyphs going to be a PMS grey or a percentage of
    black?\r\n\r\nI think the www. is not needed. the .com part tells people it is
    a URL. "

  body: I was thinking about using a PMS grey instead of black to soften it a little.
    The flourishes, then, would probably be a screen unless she wants an accent color.

  body: "I dislike this last version compared to the first. I think it's a step in
    reverse. The first version has a lot going for it, given your Victorian-look goal,
    but I agree that Caslon OpenFace is quite rigid\u2026 have you looked at using
    a Swash Italic or similar? What about a thin arabesque in the vertical space between
    'pbook' and 'nor'?\r\n\r\nRoss"

    if you left the type as-is, and tried incorporating the flourish as part of one
    of the letters itself? Might tie it together better."

  body: "Don't like the typeface. I would also question it's Victorian qualities.\r\n\r\nFlourishes
    are far too much, and of a distant aesthetic to the logotype -- agree that building
    them into the letters would look much better.\r\n\r\nYou can get a Victorian 'feel'
    with modern design sensibilities if you try -- at the moment the only Victorian
    thing about it is the slapdash, over the top, look of the whole thing."

  body: I will try  incorporating the flourish into one of the letters and post again.
    I think I need to draw it out more. I like the idea of the swash, but I don't
    like the whole logo italicized - hand drawn might help. thanks.

  body: Currently everything is disjointed The "The"  is too important (who cares
    if its the "The") and your flourish has nothing to do with the rest of the mark.
    Experiment with the idea of the flourish being a background element screened back.
    Make the focus Scrapbook Manor maybe even loose the "The"

    because of the web search.\r\nI have been using a screened back flourish for other
    designs all along, I'm just struggling with the logo type . . . maybe it doesn't
    need to be included.\r\nI don't want her to \"settle\" for a logo, just because
    it is \"better\" than what she has."
