  called \"Global \u2013 Regional\" i have setup an <a href=\"http://www.questionpro.com/akira/TakeSurvey?id=823625\"
  target=\"_blank\">online survey</a>. It takes about 3 minutes to fill out. Everything
  else is described on the website. \r\nThis project aims to answer the question if
  design will be more regional or more global in style, colors, etc. in 2015 than
  now - and why that. Your answers will help me finding an answer.\r\nTHANK YOU."

  body: "A quick and rather broad observation:\r\n\r\nI'd imagine global would by
    2015 include a lot more regional strands. That's as compared to today when global
    is, by and large, Western.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, regional styles would quite
    likely get more global in expression. That's something we've seen a good deal
    in India over the past decade."

  body: "i agree with you. its not \"global or regional\" in my opinion, its more
    global + more regional strands. i was travelling in asia this summer so i got
    a good view into the local design culture + im looking to include as many asian
    designers as possible.\r\n\r\nquote from an answer from an indian designer studying
    in the us right now:\r\n<cite>[...] I think this has to do with the fact that
    colour has been played with in textiles and other fields in India for thousands
    of years, and this has led people to hit upon say, the perfect navy that sits
    right with that particular yellow ochre, and so on. Also, contrary to popular
    belief, bright colours are not the only ones that are used in India, subtle combinations
    of whites on whites, olives, greys, browns, powder blues are also seen used in
    traditional and current applications.</cite>\r\n\r\nvery interesting stuff. if
    you want to write more about your experiences with how indian design evolved in
    the last decade, MORE THAN HAPPY to read it!"
