    looks like Times (the S's are different). I am trying to identify the BROOKS font

  body: "I think you may be right about Goudy. [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/(Goudy+Old)/fonts/|Goudy
    Old Style]], seems to match, but because the letters are either angled or out
    of focus, it's hard to be positive, especially about whose version it might be.
    The upper arm of the K looks a little heavier than any of the font samples, but
    that might be a result of stamping the letters on the box. The printed sample
    on the bag is harder to see clearly.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    I didn't notice it in the fonts I saw, or the type sample books.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Hi Mike\r\n\r\nYeah, im pretty certain about the rest of the type being set
    in Goudy Old Style.\r\nChecked and compared the shapes on-screen with those in
    The 2008 Brooks Catalouge.\r\nThat double 'O' ligature might very well be a metal
    face feature?\r\nPrehaps a custom? Thank you for your responses!"
