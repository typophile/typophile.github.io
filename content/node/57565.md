body: "Does anyone have the verbiage for a copyright statement that includes multiple
  owners? I'm doing a high school literary yearbook with text and art contributions
  from several students. I'd like to have some kind of copyright notice on back of
  title page. Currently I have a placeholder... \"Copyright (c) 2009 by XYZ High School.
  All rights reserved\"....  I'd like to include the contributors too, but would prefer
  to have some kind of blanket verbiage -- and not name them all.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks."
