    identical to above digits), TQ (sample [[http://dc-crafts.main.jp/trm/f/zxx_tq11-sample02.gif|here]])
    and MT (sample [[http://dc-crafts.main.jp/trm/f/zxx_mt10-sample01.gif|here]]).
    Can't say for the moment if it's the original name and if it covers all glyphs
    present on this plate."
