  a book designer/typesetter from the Midwest who just recently moved to NYC. I am
  a freelancer and I need to update my prices. Does anyone have a recommendation of
  how much to charge for an interior book design? How about for typesetting? By the
  character count or by the page? I want to have competitive pricing, but I don't
  want to give it away! NYC is expensive, after all. ! \r\n\r\nAny suggestions would
  be welcome. Thanks! Janet"

    approx 7 cents a word.\r\n\r\nFor interior book design I charge $25/page for text
    only and between $40 and $50/page for illustrated books. This fee includes the
    cover design, typesetting and one round of layout correx. Additional correx billable
    hourly at $50/hour."

    production - pricing, etc) - all extra and billable as such.

  body: "Patty, you sound like you are giving out prices for design/layout - which
    depending on the publisher does yield about $15 to $100 per page, depending on
    book, budget, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, in just good old typesetting of a page - it
    use to average out to about $2.50 per page.\r\n\r\nJanet - the very best of luck
    - I use to typeset (and design) book interiors for Berkley, Simon & Schuster,
    Avon, etc. I am no longer in the city -- and none of the major publishers seem
    to care for freelancers to do it anymore. One of the publishers now has a dept
    within the production dept -- and they are happy in a few typefaces with the same
    basic design for each book. When it came to the complex books that need thought,
    design, sense of layout, etc. -- they decided only to buy packaged goods. \r\n\r\nGood
    luck - it's a tough world, and yes, New York is very expensive."
