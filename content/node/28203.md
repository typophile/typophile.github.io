  seem to understand why fonts that I built in FontLab and made OTF-fonts of, show
  themselves in Suitcase Fusion as \"Foundry: Adobe Systems\".\r\n\r\nI havent provided
  this information any where in the font...\r\n\r\n?"

    settings. Your TrueType vendor code will be set at ADBE, which is Adobe's. This
    vendor code will end up in the OS/2 table of your OT font and therefore will be
    identified as an Adobe font.\r\n\r\nPaul"

    \u2013 this one is also filled in, in the field you are mentioning. My vendor
    code is regisered at Microsoft.\r\nWhy should AUTO become Adobe Systems?"

  body: "You could check if your vendor code really ends up in the OS/2 table (by
    making a ttx dump). If it does, at least you know it probably is not a Fontlab
    issue. In the fonts I produce I use an unregistered lowercase code of my company
    and never encountered these kind of problems\r\nPaul"

  body: "Paul, thanks for your reply. As you probably already had guessed I am rather
    new to all this, so making a \"ttx dump\" is something I really dont understand
    what it is. What does it mean, and how do you do it?\r\n\r\nI searched in the
    FontLab manual for ttx, no hits.\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "I'm sorry Goran, didn't mean to baffle you. TTX is well explained over <a
    href=\"http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/index.html\">here</a>, but in brief:
    ttx wil decompile your OTF file to a xml file so you can check, modify or debug
    your font in a plain text environment. TTX allows for roundtripping so you can
    recompile your ttx file to an Open Type font file. I heard some people struggling
    with it, but it works perfectly for me.\r\n\r\nPaul"

  body: "Thanks Paul :) \u2013 I\u2019ll start with this, and see if my Vendor Code
    is in the font. I just realized that it also could be Suitcase that shows Adobe
    Systems, if it dont know of my code...? Just a thought."

  body: "Goran, \r\n\r\nthe easiest thing to do is just to generate a font and then
    open it in FontLab Studio again -- you will see what vendor code got there. You
    say \"FontLab\" -- does it mean you're still using the old 4.6 version?\r\n\r\nA."

    is still there if I open the generated font in FontLab.\r\n\r\nIt must be Suitcase-related
    in other words."
