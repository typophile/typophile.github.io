body: "Hey I was just reading some talmudic translations,\r\nand found the Babylonian
  version is accepted to be the oldest and most senior.\r\nThis connects with my etymologies
  of common words in dravidian tamil...\r\nChahpahthi means full moon and round flatbread.
  Hey.\r\nI have found common words in Amharic as well. A prehistoric migration\r\nfrom
  lemuria (the giant psychic lemurs again?) across africa and back down \r\nIndia...\r\n\r\nIn
  the Talmud, Christians are called \"min\"\r\nGuess that means if you're \"max\"
  you're a satanist.\r\nEntropic, entropy is synonymous with chaos, and chaos with
  hell in a journey\r\nfrom physics to mythology.\r\n\r\n                    Lyrics
  by Lorenz Hart, music by Richard Rodgers \r\n\r\n                              Rockefeller's
  busy giving dough away;\r\n                              Chevrolet is busy making
  cars;\r\n                              Hobo, you keep busy when they throw away\r\n
  \                             Slightly used cigars.\r\n                              Hobo,
  you've no time to shirk.\r\n                              You're busy keeping far
  away from work.\r\n\r\n                              The weather' s getting fine.\r\n
  \                             The coffee tastes like wine.\r\n                              You
  happy hobo, sing,\r\n                              \"Hallelujah, I'm a bum again!\"\r\n
  \                             Why work away for wealth\r\n                              When
  you can travel for your health?\r\n                              It' s spring, you
  hobo, sing,\r\n                              \"Hallelujah, I'm a bum again!\"\r\n
  \                             Your home is always near;\r\n                              The
  moon's your chandelier;\r\n                              Your ceiling is the sky,\r\n
  \                             Way up high.\r\n                              The
  road is your estate,\r\n                              The earth your little dinner
  plate;\r\n                              It's spring, you hobo, sing,\r\n                              \"Hallelujah,
  I'm a bum again!\"\r\n\r\n                              There's a peach that's meant
  for me.\r\n                              Somewhere out in eternity.\r\n                              And
  now the flies will leave me be,\r\n                              Cause they think
  i'm in company G.\r\n\r\n                              The weather' s getting fine.\r\n
  \                             The coffee tastes like wine.\r\n                              You
