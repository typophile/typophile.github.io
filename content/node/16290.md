  for digital video? I'm helping a friend with titles for her documentary film, and
  we're having a heck of a time. Most of the type has been done in Avid directly,
  and it looks fine (we're using Quadraat and Neutra).\r\n\r\nThe problem is, the
  title itself is in both Hebrew and English, and I drew the Hebrew myself in Illustrator.
  \ We've tried importing the .ai file directly, but it endied up looking very bitmapped.\r\n\r\nI've
  brought the files into photoshop, both with and without anti-aliasing, and then
  I've added gaussian blurs of .5 to 2 pixels, but to no avail. It still looks bitmappy
  in Avid.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest anything?\r\n(This is why I usually stick to
  print...)\r\n\r\nThanks so much."

    Hebrew title into Fontographer and created a little logofont.\r\nHopefully Avid
    will treat this like it treats other type..."

  body: Sounds like the answer was to bring the graphics into After Effects first,
    and then into Avid. If anyone was curious...
