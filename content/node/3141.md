  body: Outstanding. I don&#39;t see anything I would change, except <i>perhaps</i>
    to heighten the dot of the i/j so it looks more like a square than a line.

  body: Thank you for that comment, Kevin... my main concerns are the &#34;m&#34;,
    that connects in the middle before the bowl has ended, but Ive seen both Luc de
    Groot and Gerard Unger use that approach, so I guess Its OK.... I dont see any
    good solution to it anyway. The other thing is that I feel maybe the font is too
    ordinary, I dont know. But I think it will gain more character in the bolder versions.

  body: 'Hello T, <BR> <BR>I really like the concept of this typeface. <BR>I&#39;m
    not sure about the proportions... your ascenders and descenders seem to short
    at a quick look. You should print some samples on small sizes to check it out.
    <BR> <BR>Some details: <BR> <BR>1 The hairlines of &#39;a&#39; and &#39;e&#39;
    are too thin. This will cause the character to break at text sizes. You should
    make it the same constrast as in &#39;n&#39;. <BR> <BR>2 The &#39;a&#39; needs
    work to me. It&#39;s curves don&#39;t seem to match with the rest of the font.
    <BR> <BR>3 The &#39;r&#39; can be narrow. <BR> <BR>4 The upright diagonal of &#39;x&#39;
    can be thinner. <BR> <BR>If you work more on the constrast of individual charcaters,
    having &#39;o&#39; and &#39;n&#39; as references, your typeface will be more even.
    <BR> <BR>Keep up the good work! <BR> <BR>Fabio H <BR>'

  body: Hello again <BR> <BR>now i have a little more time for the rest... <BR> <BR>I
    agree what Fabio sayed about the thick/thin contrast. But I like it how you did
    in e and a! <BR>I would try do do this in the other faces... <BR> <BR>The bowls
    of o, e, d b and the other differs a lot i guess. The width of d, b, p ... seams
    for me to wide. <BR> <BR>The middle stoke of the a is to high  <BR> <BR>The curved
    middle of the z is great! <BR> <BR>s seams to be to wide, also the stroke-width
    is bolder than others <BR> <BR>Where is the uppercase? ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Greets

    this font an extention of the font family already known as  Republika ? If not
    a suggestion in name change may be appropriate. <BR>

    a 300 family font called republika by someone who will not be mentioned here.
    If one of the more regular people here want to comment on that font or person,
    it is for them to decide. <BR>
