body: 'With all of the post-TypeCon kudos being thrown around, there is still room
  to add more. One item that attendees were given at registration was the premier
  issue of &#34;Interobang&#34; edited by Steven Coles. Not quite a newsletter, not
  quite a magazine, but still a fine member publication and yet another reason to
  join SOTA. I am really looking forward to issue #2. Nice job SColes! <BR> <BR> <BR>For
  those SOTA members who did not make TypeCon, a nice little package will be sent
  out as a consolation prize...and for those contemplating joining SOTA for this year,
  we will add in a few other things to be announced soon. <a href="http://www.typesociety.org/memjoin.html">SOTA
  membership</a> runs from Jan1-Dec31 each year and even though the conference is
  a fond hazy memory, there are plenty of reasons to join &#40;not least of all, so
  we can get the groundwork for the bay area Typecon2004 started&#41;. <BR> <BR>This
  is really turning into a sales pitch so I will get back to my TypeCon2003 photo
  page which will be posted soon. <BR> <BR>Great to see everyone in MinneSOTA!   <BR>'
