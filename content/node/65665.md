    \r\nBut perhaps it's also kind of hard to do that growing up in Switzerland. :)\r\n\r\nMy
    first favorite font, which I loved dearly, was Bookman. I used it for school papers,
    which was probably fine until I started pairing it with something like Blur for
    titles and subheads. Nobody could read it, but I tried very hard to ignore those
    comments because I just thought it looked so very cool. :-)"

  body: I once used Hobo for the logo of a lawn care company (just one guy really,
    a friend). He was pleased with it. In my defense, this was the late 80s. But Hobo
    was probably already dated/overused.

  body: Hm... Well, I like to I think I had relatively good taste in type even when
    I was in high school. The earliest typefaces I remember liking back then were
    Windsor, Avant Garde, and Bookman, all in rub-down type. I remember thinking the
    ITC faces I saw in the Chartpak catalog were the best-looking. I had an aversion
    to what we call "retro" now--brush scripts and the like. I used Korinna for my
    first personal letterhead when I was in college in about 1975. I think my wardrobe
    was more cringe-worthy than my type choices back then--polyester shirts, bell-bottoms,
    and aviator frames. Bleah.

  body: I feel sincerely sorry for my middle school yearbook cover design. I had combined
    a playful brushy font with Copperplate, the latter set in a rainbow of colours,
    which was cringe-worthy enough. But the yearbook advisor was attached to the idea
    of using Aboriginal paintings&mdash;the kind with colourful mosaic-like arrays
    of dots&mdash;for the background, which left the cover an undistinguishable splash
    of various colours and rendered the whole thing unreadable. Even my young self
    knew that the type and cover didn't go together, although I dared not speak up
    about it.
