body: "This sample was sent to me asking to know what font the Costa Cruise folks
  were using on their site (http:www.costacruises.com). The E is shaped like a C with
  a line in the middle, the 'a' is single-storey, the U has a stem, and the 'y' has
  a u-shaped bowl. It doesn't show up in the Sans Serif ID Guide, even though its
  attributes are distinctive, and there were enough letters to assign the full set
  of style codes.\r\n\r\nAnyone recognize this font? Thanks for any help."

    already passed along the answer.
