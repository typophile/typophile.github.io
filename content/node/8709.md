  body: It also depends very much on where you are. In Europe, it seems to be pretty
    widely legal that you can photocopy an entire book if it is for your own use.
    In Canada, photocopying even one page for pretty much any purpose seems to be
    illegal, althought I suspect that this might have relaxed a little in recent years.
    Shortly after I was at university here, big signs went up around the photocopy
    machines in the library warning students that they should not copy any material
    that was still in copyright.

    we read that within a HEI you can photocopy 5% or an article or a chapter of a

    of diatance learners. At the same time, it expressly forbids scanning in. Pretty
    simple; and could please any pedants inclined to observe that modern photocopiers
    are in effect scanners reflect on the distinction between a single copy whose
    destination is known, and unlimited, uncontrolled copies.  <BR> <BR>In the way
    of a postscript I will add that when Typo Papers started going out of print we
    did look into other distribution models. However, the earlier issues in particular
    were produced on a traditional workflow &#40;paste-ups, film, etc.&#41;; to resurrect
    a print job from a legacy pre-press environment and generate PDFs is, as they

    moment you bought a copy of any publication you essentially agree to respect the

    applies. Any decisions in the realm of ethics come over and above legal obligations,
    to further protect the rights holder, rather than open up distribution to third
    parties. So, even if the law allowed you to photocopy and distribute a TypoPapers
    article without clearance, the ethical stance would be to seek permission from
    the originator. But you could never claim an ethical ground for ignoring rights
    in the name of &#34;freedom of information&#34; or something similarly vacuous.
    &#40;To be more precise: you could argue that there is a case for reviewing proprietary

    arch-shaped old wooden radio in the 1950s which often behaved badly. It lived
    prominently in her kitchen--as you know, the kitchen is the central focus of a
    Yiayia&#39;s house. There was an ethnic radio station which, for 2 hours a day,
    played Greek music and advertised local Greek merchants &#40;usually restaurants&#41;.
    It didn&#39;t matter much to her if the radio was being problematic the rest of

    but if it made one disagreeable sound during &#34;Grecian Melodies,&#34; my Grandmother
    would launch into a frenzied list of accusations and a string of Greek curse words

    and a slap on the radio&#39;s side. The radio, knowing the power its mistresses
    voice, immediately behaved and played beautifully. This prompted her to say, &#34;En
