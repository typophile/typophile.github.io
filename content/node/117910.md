  body: "_W_ and _S_ are not based on a font. \r\nThey are a monoline version of a
    very common lettering style called Tuscan. In Tuscan the split ends can take many
    forms that resemble anything from a mustache, to balloons, to the boxy split seen
    on these letters. \r\nHere are a few fonts with ends like this: Frisco Antique
    SG http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/frisco-antique-display-sg/ Saloon
    Girl http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/saloon-girl/ and URW Woodtype http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/wood-type/.\r\nThe
    holes punched at the crotch of the split ends were a commonly used technique in
    making a Victorian decorative letter. These circular bites can appear at many
    places on a letter. See for example Alt Gotisch http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/alt-gotisch/\r\nDon"

  body: "Custom, hand-drawn, but based on Victorian woodtype and steelplate lettering.\r\n\r\nThis
    foundry specializes in revivals of that era's type: http://www.letterheadfonts.com\r\nPicking
    and choosing from among their fonts will give you decent matches to the OLVE in
    your sample.\r\n\r\nAs for the split-end initial caps, I know I've seen something
    similar in type specimen books from the late 19th century, but I'll have to do
    more research.\r\n\r\nEDIT--Letterhead Fonts \"Billhead\" might give you a base
    W and S that you can adapt to create similar Tuscan initials."
