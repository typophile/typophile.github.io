    Le Corre]]. He has some great antique revival fonts that I hope could fit your
    needs.

  body: "Guys, how about a font with a large x-height like would actually be used
    in a dictionary?\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm getting at is: how much of this is about
    authenticity versus merely the perceptions of people who don't read print (or
    read, period) anymore?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    if not the first--was printed with [[http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/68/44368-004-99C48BAB.jpg|a
    type that resembles Caslon]].
