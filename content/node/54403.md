body: "DSType announces the release of the new website and very soon a completely
  new online store will be available. The new site brings new typefaces: Dobra and
  Glosa Display.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dobra</strong>\r\n\r\nWe proudly introduce Dobra,
  the redesign of a previous released typeface by DSType named Dione. We decided to
  keep the same basic structure but we added more style and personality, while gaining
  a few more weights and styles. Dobra is now more robust than ever and is available
  in five weights with matching italics and is a good choice both for publication
  designers and corporate identity.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=59\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Glosa
  Display</strong>\r\n\r\nGlosa Display is the latest addition to the Premium Typefaces
  and the perfect companion to previously released Glosa. With it's extra high contrast
  for eye-catching feature titles and strong personality, Glosa Display is the ideal
  typeface for use in very big sizes, every time you want to achieve a stylish but
  classic look.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=57\r\n\r\nDino dos Santos\r\nDSTYPE\r\n"

  body: "\"What is the difference between a \u201CPremium Typeface\u201D and a non-premium?\"\r\n\r\nGlad
    you ask!\r\nThe Premium Typefaces are more like a process or a service than just
    a collections of fonts.\r\n\r\nYou can choose to license 10 weights, for instance,
    and that doesn't mean that the weights should be the ones available in my site
    because it's possible to customize certain aspects (weights, widths and few new
    glyphs) without charging extra money. Of course without exclusivity.\r\n\r\nThis
    implies a more close relationship between designer-costumer, and I appreciate
    that. The client might need a not-so-condensed version of Prelo, and a weight
    between the Medium and Semi-Bold, to use in the cover of a magazine. It will allow
    the fonts to fit as perfect as possible, the costumer ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\nDino"
