  like how clean and simple her page is, but the main reason I posted her link is
  because of the way her windows pop up inside of the home page. If you were to click
  the news, about, or contact sections, you'd see what I mean. The windows stay on
  the home screen, yet a new widow doesn't really open up.\r\n\r\nThe next link is
  the Death Cab For Cutie band site. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.deathcabforcutie.com/home/\r\n\r\nI
  like the site's color palette, mostly oranges and grays. I also like its collage-y
  feel. I don't feel like this site is too over done or over designed, and it seems
  like a good example of something I can possibly achieve with my site.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
