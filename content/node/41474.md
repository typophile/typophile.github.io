  answer for months after posting in WhatTheFont forums I thought it might be best
  to put my request here!\r\nThe only info I have foung is that it might be a Letragraphic(what's
  that?) font from the 70's.\r\nIt was used by Deep Purple as a band logo around 1974
  as well as on some albums and tourbooks. The sample is from the album Made in Europe.\r\nHaven't
  really seen this any other place.\r\nThankful for any help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dpfont_5907.jpg]"

  body: "from http://www.deep-purple.net/qanda/qanda.htm\r\n\r\nThe Burn font doesn't
    exist, it was hand drawn (as was the In Rock font - although I did digitally redraw
    and make up extra letters for this for the anniversary CD edition). The Mk 3 logo
    I'm pretty sure came from a special designers' series produced by Letraset for
    their dry-transfer range. Called Letragraphica, these were sold mainly to designers
    to keep them exclusive - a much higher retail price also helped. You might be
    able to trace this by sending a scan to their web site enquiry address.\r\n\r\nThe
    Made In Japan font is a puzzle. It may well be hand-drawn - the letter \"P\" isn't
    totally consistent - but that could just be poor printing. EMI Spain used extra
    letters in the font on their version of the anniversary CD, but whether they traced
    the original or simply made them up digitally I don't know.\r\n\r\nThe font used
    for the word Fireball on the sleeve was commercially available and has been digitised,
    though I don't know the name. So, an opportunity for someone out there to do some
    research! There is a type library and museum in London who might be able to help,
    but I don't know how far up to the present their collection is. They do have the
    font designed for British Overseas Airways Corporation which I've always loved,
    and I'd like to go down and scan this some day. But that's another story.\r\nSimon
