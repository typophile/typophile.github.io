  use commercial printing the most.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any info, like which industry
  sector do you do the most work for, can you let me know, plus say which country
  you are from?\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance\r\n\r\nCyn"

    and publication. A lot work for printing suppliers, not customers.\r\n\r\nCheck
    with your university library. I suspect that there are government statistics on
    this that will be much more useful than anecdotal postings. "

    they are designing for . . .  because most of their work goes to printers.\r\n\r\nYou
    know what I mean? if Designer A does 6 jobs for medical, 12 jobs for electrical,
    4 jobs for, let's say automotive, logically these are jobs to be printed for these
    various business sectors?\r\n\r\nOr is there another reason people do DTP?\r\n\r\nCyn

    a large or wide enough customer base for their replies to be relevant. Design
    firms are small and tend to stay local. If you want meaningful numbers, you need
    to get them from someone who communicates with a lot of printers and can sift
    through the data on a large scale. To get real answers you need to do some real
    research and not just ask people for answers online.\r\n\r\n<cite>Or is there

    a tool that designers use. "
