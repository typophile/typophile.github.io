  body: "While they're not the most clear example of classic proportions, the Caps
    are clearly referencing the Ancient Roman lettering. The midpoint used in SPD
    is straight out of the chiseling tradition. The lowercase is a cursive that I
    think was famous in the Renaissance calligraphic circles. The ascender is higher
    than the Cap Height (l vs. G) but the f and the archaic s are lined up with the
    Cap height and not the ascender line.\r\nWhat do You think some of the features
    are?\r\nDo you think or do you know if this a job of calligraphy? Maybe it's lettered
    and that would explain the inconsistency in the rendering of the same letter?"
