  Does anybody know what this is? I'm strangely fascinated by the \"g\".\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g-id_4107.jpg]"

    seems to be longer in this sample though \u2013 would you say that's custom?"

  body: "Broadway shown in the Dan Solo \"Moderne Alphabets\" book has a two-story
    g with a closed lower bowl, as an alternate character. This sample looks like
    an edit of that character, that removes part of the bowl.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Ah interesting!\r\nThis comes from the side of a small, old-ish truck, but
    I can't for the life of me remember if it was painted on or stuck on (and the
    picture quality doesn't help). If the former, I guess one shouldn't be very surprised
    about a custom/edited glyph."
