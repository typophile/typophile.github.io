  body: Oh, just saw Mike&#39;s post. Mobley is based on Neil Bold, but since  <BR>Alejandro
    only saw a few characters on a record cover he  <BR>invented the rest. His &#39;A&#39;
    must be one of those.

  body: Yes, too bad indeed. The description of Mobley connects it to the VGC Neil
    Bold, but it seems that the key words are that Neil Bold was the &#39;inspirational
    source&#39; of a &#39;brand new typographic whole&#39;.  In other words, while
    there may be many similarities, there are also numerous differences. <BR> <BR>If
    you&#39;d like I can post a scan of the typeface from the book.

  body: I find that OptiFonts did a Neil Bold, and it looks like the orginal.  That&#39;s
    the good news and the bad news, because OptiFonts &#40;CastCraft Software&#41;
    are notoriously hard to obtain. In my experience I have never seen a less responsive
    outfit than CastCraft.

  body: Here is a sample made with the OptiFonts version. The file information is
    a bit confusing, but says &#39;copyright 1990-91 Castcraft Sofware OPNatty&#39;,
    possibly suggesting that &#39;Natty&#39; was their actual release name for the
    font, since they usually renamed typefaces.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65633.gif"

  body: As always, very impressed by the pool of knowledge on Typophile - thanks!
    <BR> <BR>Looking at the Castcraft site I would agree that they seem a pretty chaotic
    organisation selling scruffily presented and overpriced fonts! - my enquiry was
    mostly due to curiosity, but if I ever have to purchase this font I know where
    to try!

    body: I'm sorry but I don't know if I have the right to sell this font because
      of the OptiFonts version. I've digitalized it for a school magazine. But I'll
      try to ask if it's possible to distribute it anyway.

  body: "That's OK. I don't need the font. I was just wondering if you were going
    to sell/distribute it. As long as your digitization is original, I don't think
    you have to worry about Castcraft, since I'd bet they don't own the design either.
    You might need to use a new name, since typeface names can be copyrighted.\r\n\r\nSince
    I'm not a font legal expert, you might be wise to get other opinions on this,
    but it would be a shame to let a good revival go to waste.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Jas - Neil Bold was a VGC original by one Wayne J. Stettler, 1967. VGC ceased
    to exist long ago.\r\n\r\nOpti never created fonts - they just made their own
    \"versions\" (clones) and sold them under different names. I understand from friends
    who were in the business back then that this was common. Companies would clone
    popular fonts and sell them formatted for a particular proprietary photolettering
    machine system.\r\n\r\nAs such, Opti had no \"rights\" to any VGC fonts. I really
    doubt that anyone does any more. As evidence of this, you can find plenty of one-time
    VGC originals digitally reproduced by various entities today.\r\n\r\nJust a few
    examples among many: Amelia (Bitstream [BT], Linotype [LT]), Aquarius (Red Rooster),
    several of Arthur Baker's faces, Bloc (BT as Geometric 885), China (Mark Simonson
    as Changeling), Davida (various), Eightball (Canada Type as Orotund), and so on.
    Oh, and let's not leave out Serpentine, which has been digitized by just about
    everyone.\r\n\r\nSo, I would agree wholeheartedly with Mike Y. that \" ... it
    would be a shame to let a good revival go to waste.\" I see no reason for you
    not to release what you've faithfully recreated. Note that in some of my examples
    above, the name was changed from the original. That might be a good precaution,
    but you've already got that in place with the perfect name of Armstrong.\r\n\r\nYou've
    got some wonderful fonts and photograph galleries. I really enjoyed the viewing
    - especially the pics from Japan.\r\n"
