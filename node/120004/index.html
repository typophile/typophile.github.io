  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>If you were injured while you were working, you may be able to receive compensation for your injuries. After all, your employer should carry Worker&rsquo;s Compensation insurance. Unfortunately, this is something that many employers are not doing. Because of this, you may have to contact a lawyer in St. Louis if you have been injured on the job.<p><p></p>
<p>First of all, you need to carefully consider your injuries. Maybe it was something that happened suddenly. If this were the case, you would want to fill out an accident report. This way, you would have a paper trail of everything that happened. Maybe you are currently dealing with carpal tunnel due to repetitive work with your hands. This is something that would happen more gradually. This would be another reason that you would want to contact a respected <a href="http://injurylawyerinfo.blogspot.com/2014/09/brown-and-crouppen-personal-injury.html">attorney st louis mo</a>.<p><p></p>
<p>Your attorney will schedule a free consultation appointment with you. This way, he can sit down with you and go over the details of your accident. Sometimes, the accident may have been your fault. If this were the case, remember that you may still have compensation waiting for you. This is why you never want to assume that you know how things are going to work out.<p><p></p>
<p>The only way that you would ever be held accountable for your injuries that were your fault is if you were drinking on the job, behaving irresponsibly at work, or if you injured yourself on purpose to get out having to work.<p><p></p>
<p>You should never have to pay money out of your own pocket for injuries that happened in the workplace. If you do have to pay out of your own pocket, make sure that you save receipts for everything. This way, you can ask your personal injury attorney in the St. Louis area to help you to be reimbursed.<p><p></p>
<p>Brown &amp; Crouppen is a law firm who can help you with a number of different situations. Before you get discouraged by the fact that you were injured while you were working, set up an appointment with your lawyer. This way, your lawyer can give you a professional opinion as to which way you should proceed. If you decide that you would like to hold your employer accountable for your injuries, your lawyer will get started with the necessary paperwork. It won&rsquo;t be long before you start to receive compensation for your accident. Set up an appointment to learn more today.<p><p></p>
