  body: "Pretty! I think most of the bottom text (not the \xABWorkers Club\xBB) is
    Knockout, which is available in a wide range of widths and references old wood
    type:\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013&path=head\r\n\r\nThough
    in the bottom there's something else too (for the times: 4PM\u2013LATE, 12NOON\u20131AM
    and also the 1AM LICENSE bit is a different typeface (note the raised vertex of
    the \"M\" for instance, the cuts of the \"S\", and Knockout has a different \"1\"
    with no beak \u2013 actually maybe that's why they substituted something else
    here.)"
