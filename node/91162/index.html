<p>Helvetica for body copy? Helvetica is structured in a very monotonous way, making it hard to distinguish the individual characters and character-groups that make up words. Helvetica for body text is an absolute mis-use of it. Pick a humanistic sans if you need to go with a sans. Garamond has an absolutely different flavor than Helvetica, which tells me you do not know what tone the text should communicate. So for which tone do you want to go, what is the environment of the text?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ryan, first of all: you&rsquo;re new here, and it&rsquo;s clear you&rsquo;re not shy
about going out on a limb, exposing your typographic limits.
Bravo - it&rsquo;s the best way to learn. Due to human nature, most
people will usually only reply when you say something they
don&rsquo;t agree with; if you cajole people they probably won&rsquo;t teach
you anything. As I once stated: &ldquo;Blind speculation is the key to
efficient data mining.&rdquo; :-)  But you need titanium skin to go along.</p>
<p>Just wanted to start off by saying that.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Yes, Helvetica is LOL for text. In fact for me the only way it
ever works is very light and very large. And no, it&rsquo;s not the
default sans for the web, because Windows (you know, 95%
of systems out there) doesn&rsquo;t even have it. Arial fills in for
Helvetica, and it&rsquo;s close (it&rsquo;s less un-texty) but anyway on-
screen things change so much compared to print that it&rsquo;s a
moot point.</p>
<p>All things being equal, assuming there&rsquo;s no stylistic clash the
one sans that I believe in (in terms of textiness) is Legato. See
my mini-review - the last one here:
<a href="http://typographica.org/on-typography/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2004/">http://typographica.org/on-typography/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2004/</a></p>
<p>But yes, the context of content will guide better than anything else.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m saying we don&rsquo;t use sans serif for text much in the U.S. I believe Europe is a different story. But unless you&rsquo;re aiming at a European audience, or the author is willing to put up with diminished sales so that you can show &lsquo;em, by God, you would most likely be better off with a serif typeface.</p>
<p>Having said that, we&rsquo;ve used TheSans successfully in art books, usually semi-light, or regular if the setting size is small. Also Scala sans and Quadraat sans.</p>
<p>We do set one (sort of) academic journal in Helvetica, <cite>boundary 2</cite>.  A number of people have tried to get them to change the typeface for the journal over the years; they won&rsquo;t. I guess if I worked it over some more I could make it a little more attractive. That&rsquo;s on my list, down near the bottom.</p>
<hr>
<p>BTW, how does your Garamond work out for war stories?  I was appalled to see <cite>The Pacific</cite> set in Adobe Jenson. World War II as bought to you by the Italian Renaissance. Maybe one style doesn&rsquo;t fit all?</p>

<p>The thing with sans serifs is that most designers are used to set them a bit tight by means of negative tracking and in the case of body copy you need them to set them normally and with more leading that if you were setting a serif face because the visual cohesion of the line is weaker due to the lack of serifs.</p>
<p>Also light sans faces are no good for long body copy and disastrous in books, you need the lines to have good color.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">That Gill Sans looks great. Probably a bit bigger point size than the standard book text however.  I agree with donsata, i really dont have any problem reading bold or black in running texts.  In fact I think the whole thing is kind of an old wives tale.  I was reading in &ldquo;Just My Type&rdquo; how people studying legibility based on what people could actually read (gasp, you mean not just a theory?!) found out it really had nothing to do with what was &ldquo;more legible&rdquo; based on the standard thinking: x height, large counters, etc&hellip;; but rather on what people were used to reading.  That is, what fonts were closest to the ones they see everywhere everyday.  I think that&rsquo;s pretty valid.  Think about the blackletter fonts used by the Germans for so long.  It takes me a great deal of effort to decode those forms sometimes, but the Germans, who saw them everyday, had no such troubles.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know it&rsquo;s a bit much. Because it flies in the face of the very
high valuation of Art that we&rsquo;re brought up to feel. I can just
as easily imagine a society where the painting of tableaus is
a punishable offense (not that I&rsquo;d like to live in such a society).
Basically, I think Art has too much value today; and this might
be why we&rsquo;re surrounded by vapid celebrities.</p>
<p>In any case, like I opined, any act of creativity has both Art
and Design in it; both the creator and his environment. So
if Michelangelo was paid (and he was) to create his art then
he was serving a client - he was directing his expression to
make others happy. Design. At least to a decent extent.</p>
<p>One quandary I have to admit to here is that, if a given piece
of art inspires me to make my own life better, does that make
it an instance of self-expression that helps others? If so, does
it matter whether that was the intent of the artist or it was
simply coincidental? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>I look at it another way.
Chick Corea expressed it on the liner notes of his <em>Piano Improvisations Vol. 1</em> album in 1971: “This music was created out of the desire to communicate and share the dream of a better life with people everywhere.”
One side of the album is quite lyrical and charming, dreamy in a conventional way. But the other side has a fair bit of experimental plinking and plunking.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you could say the album was an artist expressing his own interests, but as the man said, he was sharing a dream, and it’s certainly inspired me.</p>
<p>Type design isn’t music, but I don’t see why, in lieu of being merely functional, it can’t also have the quality of being able to bring delight through its formal beauty, and stimulate the intellect through the idiomatic play of design—and to do so subtly, with taste.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I once read a great book on legibility which got burnt in a fire last november&hellip; but what I can remember is that reading, as a perception process, is led by the mind&rsquo;s never ending search for sense in the stimulations it gets. So in theory we could easily read any kind of text (in a broad not latin type centric sense) that has enough differentiation features to hold meaning&hellip; but then we also have to take into account eye comfort, familiarity and practicity which is why as time passes we become more and morep picky about what&rsquo;s readable. The more we refine visual comfort, visual and sintactic familiarity and practice, the more we will find different visual styles of text unsuited for speedy, effective and comfortable read.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Familiarity is s complex thing. You can recognize
a letterform even if you&rsquo;ve never seen it before.
And you can often recognize distorted or abstract
letterforms, although it might -tellingly- take more
than a fraction of a second. The main question in
my mind concerns immersive reading: how does
exposure to a specific style of letter affect its high-
speed decipherment? Although I don&rsquo;t know the
answer to that, I can confidently believe that the
inherent qualities of letterforms are not irrelevant,
that they contribute to how smoothly/quickly this
familiarity can be gained; I&rsquo;m also confident that a
typestyle can have inherent flaws that place upper
limits on how comfortably it can be read no matter
how much you&rsquo;re exposed to it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, it may not  kind, but it is fair. The evaluation of performance of any product falls on a bell-shped curve. If it is a manufactured item, somebody gets the good ones where the numbers are close to the zero defects point. Others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>To put a point on it, if you ask the guy who bought the Yugo that falls at the extreme left of the curve, he&rsquo;ll tell you it&rsquo;s a great car.</p>
<p>Type, esp. type as software, doesn&rsquo;t have those manufacturing issues. But acceptance is also a bell-shaped curve &ndash; in me, for example, you&rsquo;ve found one of the few people who doesn&rsquo;t like Gotham. Doesn&rsquo;t make me either right or wrong, just far out on the curve.</p>
<p>So asking for &ldquo;best,&rdquo; even with an exhaustive survey, just gives you that curve. Buried in that math, of course, is evaluation. As Nick said, if you include a fair bit about &ldquo;best for what,&rdquo; you shorten up the curve.  A general &ldquo;best&rdquo; is just a poor thing to ask for, anyone working beyond the level of a neophyte should know that.</p>
<p>To be kind would be to just ignore such posts, which I usually do, In this case, I feel strongly enough about the <em>general</em> unsuitability of a sans for bookwork in the U.S. to reply, with the stated exceptions of travel and art books &ndash; or a specific case where it would be appropriate. Reason needed there, of course.</p>
