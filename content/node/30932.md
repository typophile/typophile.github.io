  body: "hend it?\r\n\r\nI've never liked that b.\r\nThe alternative script form of
    b, which keeps going in a counter-clockwise rotation at the bottom of the main
    stroke, and then connects to the next letter from a little ball at one o'clock,
    is far less ambiguous, and has a great deal of historical precedent -- though
    perhaps not totally authentic vis-\xE0-vis Mr Bickham.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nMore

  body: "Dear Cleric,\r\n\r\nBrilliant! Cheers! Is the word \"Bickham\" set in the
    lovely roman which I remember seeing in Bickham's classic book of engravings once?
    I believe it's called 'Universal Penmanship' and it's well worth a trip to the
    library. Is the international shipping quite expensive?\r\n\r\nNick, I'm sorry
    but I've no idea what you're going on about. What's going to happen at 1:00?"

    What I mean is that this kind of script structure is more like a b, less like
    an h."

  body: "I assumed that \"Bickham\" wasn't set in Bickham because the designer wanted
    to use all caps.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would love an XXL if possible, or failing
    that an XL. A plain ol' large doesn't do me much good. Heck, I'd pay extra for
    an XXL.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
