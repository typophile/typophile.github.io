body: "I've noticed that many Adobe fonts include a character called circumflex.cyr
  as a variant of spacing circumflex which appears as an inverted, cyrillicized breve.
  However, I can't find any examples of a circumflex accent actually appearing in
  cyrillic. Can someone explain to me when this character is used? Is this intended
  as a spacing version of U+0484 COMBINING CYRILLIC PALATALIZATION, or is this used
  for something else?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/p/fontforge/mailman/fontforge-devel/thread/200503271307.25131.akrioukov@newmail.ru/\">Fontforge
    thread</a>. \r\nNote that his font Old Standard uses   <code>/cyrflex                     %
    U+F6D5</code>. \r\nIt seems to me that cyrflex and circumflex.cyr are two names
    for the same entity as I gather from the link http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/poltawski/goadb100.nam\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n

  body: It's just an alternate form of the breve used for Cyrillic. Not sure why it
    is labeled as a circumflex in some fonts, but I suspect the later versions correct
    that.

  body: "The sentence that struck me in Kryukov's argumentation was\r\n<blockquote>\r\nIn
    fact, cyrflex should be treated as a spacing version of uni0311 (inverted breve)
    rather than as a special modification of circumflex.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe next
    sentence mentions its use for Serbian. \r\n\r\nThe Adobe glyph list http://sourceforge.net/projects/aglfn.adobe/files/
    \ now contains <code>cyrflex;F6D5</code> (PUA) whereas <code>F6D5</code> is called
    <code>circumflex.cyr</code> in this other file on the Adobe site <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/files/typblography/charsets/aw2_plus_cyr.txt\">...typblography/charsets/aw2_plus_cyr.txt</a>."

  body: "I am still puzzled by the naming. I understand that the Adobe convention
    is that a character name followed by a period and some extension names a variant
    of that character. So, clearly, \u201Ccircumflex.cyr\u201D was not appropriate.
    If I rely on the wiki on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian_phonology\">Serbo
    Croatian phonology</a>, the inverted breve corresponds to a long vowel with a
    falling tone, clearly not a variation of something \u201Cbreve\u201D i.e. short
    (should we understand that \u201Cinverted breve\u201D = \u201Cinverted short\u201D
    = \u201Clong\u201D?). So maybe \u201Ccyrflex\u201D was chosen to remind us of
    the Greek circumflex that looks the same.\r\n\r\nAdded: the relation with the
    Greek circumflex is confirmed by what is said in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_breve#Serbo-Croatian"

  body: "Thanks, everyone. So it would seem that this character is intended for use
    in Serbian, and should really be called \"space_uni0311.cyr\" rather than \"circumflex.cyr\".
    My confusion stemmed largely from the fact that it seemed odd to include a *spacing*
    modifier in a font when no precomposed characters in the font make use of it as
    a component. And, until I read the links provided by Michel, I hadn't been able
    to find any examples of cyrillic characters which made use of either a circumflex
    or an arch (=inverted breve).\r\n\r\nThanks for the links,\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
