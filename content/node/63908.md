  information on \"green\" services and what not in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. \r\n\r\nThe
  mark is Texas and the orange part represents DFW.\r\n\r\nNot sure if I feel satisfied
  about it, but she likes it. What do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gogreenlogo_6272.jpg]"

  body: "The concept is great. The shape of the largest leaf is funky. I think you
    can alter its shape in a way that both perfects the balance of the mark and maintains
    the shape of the state. There's also something about the top left leaves that
    disrupt the balance.\r\n\r\nNice type. The kerning isn't so hot, though. Either
    tighten up \"reen\" to match the \"go\" and \"gr\" or loosen \"gog.\" I personally
    think the tighter version might look a bit better."

  body: Is there any leaf that's very specific to Texas? the state tree or something?
    I remember a lot of pecan trees from my last visit

  body: "Well, the pecan tree is the state tree here. However, I live here and didn't
    even know that without looking it up, so I don't believe modeling the leaves after
    pecan leaves will be that significant.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, the leaves do
    look like pecan tree leaves. =)"

  body: "It was really hard for me to make out the shape of Texas in the leaves. The
    idea isn't bad though. I'd push the development a bit further. Also, the orange
    color makes it seem like that leaf is dead. Is that what you want for the key
    area?\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "@penn,\r\n\r\nI thought that, too (orange=dead leaf), but with a call to
    action like \"go green,\" it implies that they are not yet green and need to be.
    Thoughts?"

    I thought, \"Why are the leaves plopped in that awkward configuration?\" I like
    the texas-shape idea, but I don't think this is quite right yet. ____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

  body: "Good ideas. Thanks for all the feedback.\r\n\r\nYa, I've seen the Unilever
    logo before but was hoping to achieve the same effect with simpler shapes. I can
    try out some different configurations of the leaves. \r\n\r\nI can see how orange
    can resemble a dead leaf. Hmmm"

  body: Maybe this logo does ride the coattails of uni-lever, but having lots of small
    little shapes certainly relates to the presentation of information in blog format.
    Perhaps, if done right, you leave a lone-star over the dallas/fort worth area
    made by negative space

    a little tweaking, I saw that it was texas right away.

  body: I didn't see Texas until I read your goal. The shape needs to be tweaked a
    little and you've gotten some good suggestions. I'd like to add one, try making
    all of the leaves one shade of green and the DFW leaf a different shade of green
    and match that color to the letters "DFW". I believe using one color for the overall
    shape of Texas will help unify the parts into a whole.

  body: in addition to others comments, you need to finess all of the leaves. make
    all of the curves perfect and harmonious with each other.

  body: "Keep at it. Leaves are a tired symbol, but using them to become a different
    object could work. I think you just need to keep reworking the concept. I didn't
    see texas until you mentioned it. Maybe abstract the shapes of the leaves to become
    more interesting and lend to the shape of the state. You're doing vice versa and
    abstracting the shape of the state to maintain the shapes of the leaves and it's
    confusing. \r\n\r\nYou have a great concept so keep iterating until you hit jackpot."
