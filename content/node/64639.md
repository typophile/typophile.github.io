    on google & co., this was the name of the \"creative\" department/organisation
    in the GDR. I think were was nothing that we should call \"corporate design\"
    in the GDR. This thin folder for the 750 Berlin anniversary is a very late sample
    of a major national advertising project and can't be used as representative for
    design in the GDR at all.\r\n\r\nBTW. I don't know of many samples for the usage
    of Maxima in ordinary live. \r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\" target=\"_blank\">astype.de</a>--"
