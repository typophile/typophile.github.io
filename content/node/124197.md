  on to announce a project I am working on. But I hope you might think this is interesting
  and therefore can forgive me :) It is an iOS app called Font Drafts, designed to
  boost the font sketching process and I am currently looking for beta testers. If
  anyone of you are interested, please sign up at the website: [[http://fontdrafts.com]]\r\n\r\nThis
  seems like a great forum by the way, so I think I might hang around a bit more :)"
