    crime/terrorist organization symbols/logos/etc. for the Anti-Defamation League.\r\n\r\nThey
    can be found here: http://adl.org/hate_symbols/default_graphics.asp\r\n\r\nI finding
    myself getting deeply depressed while working on this project. Glad it's over!
    Many of them, graphically, are quite interesting."

  body: Good question Satya! Never thought about the fact that terrorist organisations
    like so many other organisations need identities. Don't think you're gonna find
    the designers though. They are probably hiding in some cave with an old 486 processor
    at their disposal;o)
