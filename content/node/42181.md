    the file that you're having trouble attaching.

    problems.

  body: "\"Why don\u2019t you just post a list with the names...\"\r\nI'm guessing
    gen79 is trying to post samples of fonts in use, and is probably trying to find
    out what they are called.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I really like the third one\"\r\nWhich
    third one, Frode?"

  body: "I for one printed it out and tried to figure it out the good old fashioned
    way. Quite interesting looking at all of them printed off of a low res laser printer
    at work.\r\n\r\nMost of the finer details just disappear, leaving you having to
    figure things out by skeletal structure. Very informative."

  body: Personally I don't care what your list contains. It is boring because it is
    only a list. Who cares. If you want anyone to care perhaps you should explain
    the reasons for your choices. Lacking that, again, who cares. A waste of list
    space as far as I can see.

  body: "If you're asking for critical responses to your list, here goes. Perpetua,
    ideal for display, makes a surprisingly crude, unsatisfactory text face. Joanna
    is more legible, but the italics look absurd; there's a tradition of designing
    italics with different proportions than the roman, and Joanna is exhibit A for
    why that tradition should be rejected. The best Gill serif is Aries, with default-loaded
    oldstyle figures (not all versions have that). Walbaum: which one? Berthold, famously
    used by Musee d'Orsay, is just too heavy in its basal weight; ditto Linotype;
    Monotype is a little too wimpy and still does not offer default-loaded oldstyle
    figures. So I would recommend Storm Foundry's version--just right, with default-loaded
    OSFs. Times is now the most over-exposed typeface on earth, reason enough never
    to use it. Monotype Spectrum should be shunned...I'm reading a book set with it
    now...though good for display, for text use, it's wimpy and lame, does not offer
    default-loaded oldstyle figures...and the liner figures look awful. Ugh! \r\n\r\nYou
    should also consider Janson Text, Storm's Regent II, Scala, Bitstream Arrus (now
    with OSFs), Bembo, ITC Bodoni 12, Galliard (now with OSFs for all fonts via ITC
    in OT), Buccardi, ITC New Baskerville, Celeste, Electra, Esta, Corundum, Legacy
    Serif, Stone Serif, NuSwift, Proforma. "
