body: "Having just joined to discuss the incorrect typeface answer in some really
  old posts (since I can't find a better answer), I am stunned by the password complexity
  for this place.\r\n\r\nThe rules are beyond ridiculous - they are actually stupid.
  Your medical data is not protected by such draconian password rules and there are
  serious federal penalties for those breaches.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing here that
  deserves a password beyond a simple dictionary word, but an algorithm that thinks
  a 15 character password with a punctuation character is medium strength is seriously
  broken.\r\n\r\nhttp://xkcd.com/936/\r\n"

    level of \u201Csecurity\u201D for the entered password. This feedback is provided
    by what I\u2019m pretty sure is a typical Drupal/JQuery script. \r\n\r\nThere
    is absolutely nothing that prevents a user from using whatever password they want,
    despite what the algorithm thinks about the complexity of it.\r\n\r\n"
