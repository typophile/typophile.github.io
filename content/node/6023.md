body: My main question here is whether or not the letter spacing in VSG looks OK to
  your raw eyes, but I welcome any other comments as well. <BR> <BR>This is one of
  those projects that has been reserrected from several months of rest. It&#39;s a
  logo for a professional athlete agency in the Southeast &#40;Georgia, Alabama&#41;.
  I am dealing with a challenging client, and don&#39;t expect to be able to make
  many major alterations at this point

  body: Scott, <BR> <BR>The right stem of the &#34;V&#34; looks too thin. I think
    a  condensed sturdier font under the icon may give it more stability. Also, in
    the space between the thin and thick bars on the stem on the G should be more
    straight. In the other parts of the logo, the taper is less obvious. <BR> <BR><img

  body: Version 5 and 6 -- are these marks including a rectangular background. Or
    just marks placed on a rectangle randomly chosen? <BR> <BR>In the subline, there
    seems to be too much space between R and T &#40;and too little between U and P?&#41;

  body: Thank you Tom and Soren for your comments. I apologize for not responding
    earlier. I will look into some potential alternatives for the title line, although
    the logo has already been approved, as is, so I was expecting to only make minor
    adjustments. The rectangles are not part of the logo, just showing the logo with
    a background for future applications. The identifying colors are PMS 274 and 871
