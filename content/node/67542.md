  for a fake TV channel, design a logo and guidelines. Quote from the brief \"We segue
  effortlessly from escapist, to gritty, to humanitarian, to sensationalist\". They
  show drama, reality TV, films, soaps and nice programmes.\r\n\r\nTarget audience
  -> Love being entertained, 16-45 with slight male bias, cultural mix, articulate,
  not affluent but have sophisticated spending and tastes.\r\n\r\nI've chosen Capra
  as a name. Taken from the Alpine mountain goat (Capra Ibex) and italian director
  Frank Capra. Here I have some logo suggestions where I've modified Clarendon to
  try and make it more contemporary. Clarendon has a nice property that reminds of
  the big round horns of the Capra Ibex.\r\n\r\nAny feedback much appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capra_v1_4308.jpg]"

  body: "To me the shape of the letters and the round terminals give it a playful
    and/or feminine vibe, really don't think you're hitting the feel you're going
    for at this point. I do like the name, though the addition of \"vision\" comes
    off as a bit forced and sort of cliched (not to mention competing with the main
    title in that serif face).\r\n\r\nHave you thought about maybe drawing typographic
    inspiration from some more cinematic sources, maybe classic movie posters and
    the like?"

    might actually go really well for another project for a female quire, I think
    I'll use this modification of Clarendon for that instead.\r\n\r\nMade another
    version that has more of a old movie poster feel to it.\r\nSlightly modified Industria
    with some retro color versions.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps more in the right direction,
    more masculine version but not too much.\r\n\r\npeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capra_v2_5005.jpg]"

    some other letterforms to create a tighter fitted /c/ you might have something

    the 'r' does later in the word?

    not directly Frank Capra's last name. The 'k' works better next to the a as well.\r\n\r\nI'm
    worried that it might be a little hard. Looks a lot harder then with a 'c'.\r\n\r\nHaven't

    to the 'a' next to it, with one of its corners squared off and the other rounded?"

    Now it looks like '@p@'. I think you need to find the happy medium between this
    and the earlier 'c'."
