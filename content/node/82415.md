body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nFor better or worse I spent a large part of my weekend playing
  L.A. Noire, and in between inspecting murder scenes I kept spotted some very nice
  bits of type - wall-painted ads, signage etc. I know that the game uses Silas Dilworth's
  Heroic Condensed (beautifully) for the title cards and menu screens among other
  things, but would really appreciate some guesses on these two examples.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nJez"
