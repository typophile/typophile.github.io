  body: Is it high-fashion or hip-hop/skater? This doesn't look high-fashion but it
    does look hip-hop. I like it.

    body: its more like a mixture of both. I don't want it to go too extreme on either
      side. But i want to keep it simple and clean so I have more freedom designing
      on both hip-hop/skate. Is there any colour changes I should make? Or should
      I just keep it black and white for the corporate look?

  body: Well I don't see the high-fashion aspect there at all. I would maybe look
    at some different type options maybe? As far as color goes I'm not sure, but b/w
    could work.

    down? How does this relate to your target market? What is the theme behind it?
    What other concepts did you come up with? Personally I would scratch it and go
    back to the sketch pad. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Johnzai, I wouldn't scratch this idea. It looks hip to me, like a figure stepping
    forward, like a little "character" so I get it. I definitely see a figure in there,
    the legs of the "r" have the baggy pants look to it. Again, I'm not sure I'm making
    the high fashion connection. Keep working on it. Logos are like ink blot tests,
    everyone will see something different.

  body: my concept was to create a series of clothing with indivdual character. reminisce
    of the copyright logo "C" and "R". By combining the two to create a logo that
    suites the character branding. As for the letter A in the character I'm not quite
    sure about that myself either. It just seems a little more appealing and attractive
    to look at. I'll keep working on it though. Thanks for the comments guys. Really
    helps. I'll keep posting. Thanks again.

  body: "Ahh I didn't get the copyright or registered theme. Interesting idea. \r\n\r\nThe
    overall feel though is more like Coach to me than hip hop-skater. I think you
    could use the copyright and r symbol with a bit more interesting type. Or mess
    around with different ways of displaying the c and r.\r\n\r\nWhat about a ligiature
    with capital RC with R before C? Or ligiature C above the R... I'll try to think
    of some interesting things."

  body: Its silly. Its design for design sake. There is little thought in the branding.
    I would do more research in the market and start over. Try some pencil sketches
    first.

    and skate styles seem to be the antithesis of high fashion, unless I am misunderstanding
    the meanings. High fashion brings to mind didones wheras skate brings grunged
    fonts to mind, not that I would necessarily advise trying to combine those into
    a logo. Although some of the flavour of the samples on this link posted by Dav
    in another thread could give you something to consider\r\nhttp://www.youarebeautiful.co.uk/bitch_web/work_01.htm\r\n\r\nTim\r\n"

    when I first looked at it I was able to read what it said quite easily without
    having to think. I suspect, though, that this is because the link says \"character.gif\"
    on it.\r\n\r\nYou might try showing it to people who know nothing of design."

    It's been all over the place in the fashion industry in the last couple of years
    or more. \r\nWould it be possible to see a bigger version of the logo? I can't
    really see the C and R thing very well and there's too much information there
    I think...either work on the CR thing or focus on the character lettering but
    I might be wrong."

  body: lol so much for my sugguestion. But who has a logo that is blackletter? I
    know a lot of people use it on shirts and redesign their logos in blackletter.
    And I was talking about modern blackletter fonts which to me can look completely
    different.

    thing is, you don't want a logo to be subject to fashion whims unless you want
    to redesign it every season. It may work for illustration but a logo is there
    to stay for a while so maybe it would be wiser to try something that is not going
    to look \"tired\" tomorrow. Just my opinion."
