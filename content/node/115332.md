  be a group that can help provide insight to a question I've been stumbling with.\r\n\r\nI'm
  going through my first experience hiring a junior designer. The applications I've
  received are all over the place -- some outstanding, some hilariously unqualified
  to do professional design work, and some just tragically bad.\r\n\r\nI find that
  I receive frequent requests from the last category inquiring why they weren't selected
  or what they could do to improve themselves. When it's a matter of not fulfilling
  all the qualifications for software proficiency or having rampant typos in their
  resumes, writing a quick critical response is easy (\"unfortunately, you do not
  currently meet the qualifications posted for this position\", \"unfortunately, your
  writing shows that your attention to detail and communication skills need improvement\").\r\n\r\nBut
  when someone is versed in the programs and wrote a nice cover letter and resume
  .... but their work is just bad, I'm at a loss for a way to quickly communicate
  that without sounding like a jerkface. I work at a small business that's active
  in the community (chances are I might run into a couple of these people someday)
  and I'm a firm believer in the power of constructive criticism, but saying that
  their taste level lacks sophistication still just seems  harsh. Am I just being
  a softie? I'd love to get into the nitty gritty about what missteps they're making
  with type, color, layouts, etc., but it would just be too time consuming.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have ideas or experiences with this to share?\r\n\r\ntldr?\r\nHow do you constructively
  tell a job applicant that their work lacks sophistication or that they don't demonstrate
  a good taste level?"

  body: "In my experience, there's a job out there for designers of all levels of
    sophistication. If an applicant's work is not at the quality levels that you expect
    at your organization, there's nothing wrong with letting them know that \"it's
    not a good match\" or \"not what we're looking for.\"  I've met many designers
    who didn't make it through our process who have gone on to great jobs and fulfillment
    elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf you had all the time in the world, you could sit with each
    applicant and coach them through how they could improve their work. In my heart
    of hearts, I often feel the same way. But who truly has that kind of time? If
    you found a junior designer you believed in and exhibited other desirable qualities
    (cultural fit, proactiveness, humility, eager to learn/grow) that in-depth coaching
    might make better sense if they were employed with you. \r\n\r\nIf your workday
    is anything like mine, time is precious and almost always at a deficit. Unfortunately,
    you may have to ask yourself: Is providing feedback to applicants the best use
    of my time?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "That link is priceless, Nick! Much like a lot of the work that was rejected
    in it :)\r\n\r\nWe're totally on the same page, Jared. I'm trying to find the
    balance between sounding curt and wasting my time giving thoughtful feedback to
    strangers. The responses I give are along the lines of your examples, but they
    also generate a lot of follow-ups asking for clarification. And <em>that's</em>
    where I get hung up. \r\n\r\nI thought I had hit a good phrasing the other day
    -- \"Keep developing your skills, and stay up to date with the standards and trends
    of the industry through blogs, publications, and professional groups\" -- but
    it didn't go over so well. Using it twice, I got one snarky response that accused
    me of not actually looking at his portfolio since I didn't give specific feedback,
    while the other decided it was an invitation to turn this exchange into an in-depth
    portfolio review to get specific feedback. This is when I start to wonder, do
    I just tell them their work looks unrefined? That the multi-colored papyrus on
    their resume shows a poor taste level (true story)? I thought my response was
    sound, fair advice, so maybe it's just the best I can hope for. "

  body: "I agree with Jared's comments. And it's certainly not necessary to say negative
    things about their work, you could just say \"another candidate fit our needs
    better\".\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, when I was just out of college several
    interviewers gave me some friendly advice about my portfolio and I found it very
    helpful.\r\n\r\n> there's a job out there for designers of all levels of sophistication\r\n\r\nSo
    true. I've known unsophisticated designers who made a nice living doing supermarket
    flyers, newspaper ads, and other work that didn't require much finesse. One of
    them makes more money than I do."
