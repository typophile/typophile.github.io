    body: That looks correct, but somehow the older piece just looks nicer. It could
      be the screen rendering... but I have a hunch that at least a little of the
      original flavor was lost in digitization.

  body: Most definitely. There are few digital faces that feature such extreme hairlines.
    When an older font is digitized, they want to make it as usable as possible over
    a range of sizes. Having such thin hairlines would make a font not look too good
    at sizes smaller than an inch or so. "It's falling apart at 36 point...better
    make those hairlines thicker."

    and ITC Busorama (display cut) as well as ITC Firenze, LSC Caslon No. 223, Mark?\r\n\r\nSomehow
    the pre-digital ITC Manhattan made it's way into the digital age with the addition
    of a pixel or two.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITC_Manhattan.png]\r\n\r\nOdd,
    though... it's not only hairline faces that need taming before going digital.
    \r\nITC Gorilla's fur looks more like Lassie than King Kong.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITC_Gorilla.png]\r\n\r\nBut
    who would ever want to see a tiny Manhattan or an one-inch gorilla anyway?\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, and my hairline is fading too!"

    and David Berlow's <a href="http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Throhand">Throhand</a>.
    But all of the old display fonts from the phototype era that have been digitized
    (the ones I know of anyway) seem to have taken a conservative approach with regard
    to the hairlines. I think it's a shame, but it's not like the situation is hopeless.

    by law or by their insurance company) to post dangers due to potential misuse

    from fine hairline strokes, couldn't the font EULA for a particular face state:\r\n<em>WARNING:

    permanent damage to your retina.</em> ;-)"

  body: There's a recent  face that boasts to have<em> "(...) an average hairline
    weight of 1% of its point size"</em> -- [[Joshua Darden]]'s <a href="http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightbig.php">Freight
    Big</a>. I have the impression that [[Matthew Carter]]'s <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BigCaslon">Big
