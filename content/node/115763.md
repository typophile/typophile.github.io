  body: "It certainly is hand-lettered, but it reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bitstream/ad_lib_std_regular/ot_tt/specimen/tester/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=45&sample_text=It%E2%80%99s%20what%20happens&ft=liga\">Ad
    Lib</a> by Freeman Craw. That\u2019s probably as close as you will get with a
    digital font."

  body: "I'm with R. I think this looks like it used Ad Lib as its model, and since
    Ad Lib was designed in 1961, the timing seems right. \"Beach Blanket Bingo\" came
    out in 1965.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
