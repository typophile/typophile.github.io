  body: "I'm a bit confused about the large x-height criterion. Something like <a
    href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/fedra_sans\">Fedra Sans</a> has a larger
    x-height, it seems on first glance, than Avant Garde Gothic or Kabel. But lots
    of contemporary sans serif designs have comparable x-heights, and even old standbys
    like Helvetica don't differ that much on x-height. Cuttlefish's Californian Grotesque,
    I'm sorry to say, has a tiny x-height relative to all the designs mentioned.\r\n\r\nSo
    does Fedra Sans fit the bill? Or should we look for even larger x-heights?"

    am trying to relate this calligraphically. If I were to cut the height of a normal
    ascender in any given lettered face then the x-height would go up... right? Condensing
    a style and keeping the as/descenders the same has no effect on the xh! To me
    a lot has to do with the height to weight ratio and the height of the as/descenders.
    You are testing my understanding so thank you Frode! I am wondering about the
    standard definitions now.\r\n\r\nWe need to question the dictionary on a regular
    basis.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: Whoa, this thread is messing with my mind. I suddenly start envisioning a
    Multiple Masters kind of program, except that instead of just providing different
    weights, it would be able to control the x-height (by changing ascender and descender
    heights). Simple programming for largely vertical characters, but a lot of challenges
    for sloped strokes like on the y and g.
