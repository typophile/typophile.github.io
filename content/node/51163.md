body: I use a signmaking software called Flexisign Pro 7.5 & 8.0. My problem is that
  it seems to need any TrueType fonts that are going to be used to be installed into
  the Windows fonts folder before it can open files containing them. I can't open
  the files until I know what fonts are in them and install them...but I can't find
  that out until I try to open them and let Flexi tell me what is missing! That takes
  forever, so I try to keep all the fonts installed all the time...I'm up to about
  7,600 right now. Can someone tell me of a font manager that would allow "instant
  activation" through flexisign? I tried extensis suitcase, and that was BAD.

  body: Customers bring them to have signs made with their particular font(s), I've
    had to purchase them in packages, single downloads here and there, you know...I've
    been building the collection since '95 or so. Most are just little mass-produced
    things, but some are cool! Sorry about the location of the post, Lex...I'm the
    F.N.G. around here...it won't happen again...thousand pardons...bow 'n scrape...retiring
    to my chambers to meditate...
