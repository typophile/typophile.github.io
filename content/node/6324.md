  NBC tonight. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to identify the transitional font used
  in their splashes and graphics mattes. I believe they also use it during Bob Costas&#39;  commentating
  for the on-screen graphics. <BR> <BR>My initial impression is Officina Serif, but
  I&#39;m sure you guys can nail it exactly.

    yes Jones looks right but either there&#39;s a bolder version or they bolded it
    by hand.
