  target=\"_blank\">Accurate glyphs for Romanian diacritics</a>. Especially the (so
  far) last post by <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/53701#comment-343913\" target=\"_blank\">Florin
  Florea</a>, to me, raises a crucial issue: How helpful are samples that are contemporary
  and of typefaces that are not of, in this case, Romanian origin?\r\n\r\nCouldn't
  typophiles whose languages use of diacritics or \"special\" character --&nbsp;including
  non-Latin scripts like Cyrillic&nbsp;-- search local libraries for <em>historical</em>
  documents and show scans or photographs, together with bibliographical data?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIdeally,
  these documents would be pre-digital. Pre-Linotype/Monotype. Even better, manuscripts.
  Not only those that conform to what may be considered as good examples by <em>current</em>
  standards but also those that do not conform. Personally, I am particularly interested
  in the variety of possibilities.\r\n\r\nSince many letters and diacritics are used
  in multiple languages, I think that there is no way around a certain amount of compromise.
  But with some background at hand one could at least make <em>informed</em> decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)\r\n\r\nComments
  and samples are most welcome!\r\n"

  body: Hi Karsten, I plan to scan samples of pre-digital diacritics used in the Czech
    language. I have many books, specimens, magazines, but the overall quality of
    the accents is often very poor due to many limits of the technology, printer skills
    etc. Once I will finish the scanning, i will upload the images to the database
    of the Diacritics Project at http://diacritics.typo.cz.

  body: I'm working on it for the Spanish tilde with both old scans, pictures of monuments
    and inscriptions, and 20th century hand-painted signs, but I'm going to wait until
    I've polished off a massive update to my blog post on its design.  Of course,
    the tilde isn't the diacritic most people are left wondering about but, meh.

    more important. And diacritics.typo.cz is a very good place for it."
