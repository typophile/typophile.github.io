body: hello all <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
  BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>i&#39;m looking for a font, but i have a name, just a description
  of what i what, and seeing as typophile is the premier typography website, i was
  hoping to get some help here and maybe pointed in some good directions. please excuse
  me if i explain things alittle funny, i haven&#39;t got my head round the correct
  jargon as yet ;&#41; <BR> <BR>okay, what i am lookng for is a sans serif font with
  a european look to it. similar to eurostile maybe, but with rounded ends. i would
  prefer it to be a fixed width font and would also prefer it to be pay and have a
  full character set as i am using it for display as well as text on a website. <BR>
  <BR>thanks in advance for any help and i hope that i have explained myself correctly.
  <BR> <BR>aeron. <BR> <BR>edit.- also i would prefer that this font be in a family
  and have varying weights [light to heavy] sorry i know i&#39;m picky and asking
  alot.. heh

    you want the ones labeled &#34;text fonts.&#34;&#41;

    fits a couple of your requirements but not others.

  body: thanks for the disgustingly quick responce marc! <BR> <BR>lineto is nice,
    thanks for the linkage. i was immediately drawn to storno... but she&#39;s still
    a few straws less a stack <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> there&#39;s only one weight and i just can&#39;t get past
    that &#39;i&#39; <BR> <BR>i had another look at myfonts and found that eurostile
    actually comes in an &#39;extended&#39; version with a regular and bold weight.
    this would be perfect if it had rounded edges... heheh... i&#39;m so picky! sorry...  <BR>
    <BR>any other suggestions would greatly be appreciated <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
