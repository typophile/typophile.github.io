  48\r\nLanston Monotyoe Corp., Ltd\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso: Is there any way to know which
  pointsize the matrices are?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo2_6656.jpg]"

    section up to the main Type ID Board.\r\nThen a lined up sample would help.\r\nAnd
    I suppose they could be 48pt (or 128)."

  body: You can get yourself a type ruler and measure the letters to figure out the
    size. I don't know if there's a way to figure that out digitally unless that image
    is 1:1 as the physical letterforms.

  body: "The numbers you've listed refer to the series number (128) and the point
    size (48).\r\nThose are Giant mats (as opposed to Composition or Display mats),
    so you need to track down a listing of Monotype Series numbers made in Giant mats
    and that will tell you what you've got."

  body: Series 128 is listed as "Title" by Lanston Monotype but the specimen in Mac
    McGrew's "American Metal Typefaces" book shows a different face from what is seen
    in those matries. So that ain't it.

  body: "Thank you so much for the response.\r\n\r\nI've looked it up as well, and
    got to the \"Title\" name, but couldn't find a specimen, so I got stuck there.
    But apparently its not that one. Still lost, but I sincerely appreciate the tips."
