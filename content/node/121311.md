body: "I have a couple of questions about the h\xE1\u010Dek and, whilst I'm sure the
  answers are buried in the forums here at typophile, I cannot find them.  \r\n\r\nI
  know that for the /d/, /L/, /l/ and /t/, the h\xE1\u010Dek takes an acute-type form.
  \ What I can't seem to find a consistent answer to is the question of what form
  the h\xE1\u010Dek takes with the /h/, /I/ and /k/.  The h\xE1\u010Dek article at
  http://diacritics.typo.cz/ doesn't mention these other letters, but other online
  sources seem to suggest the h\xE1\u010Dek is placed directly above the stem.  Is
  this correct?\r\n\r\nAs a subsidiary question, what are the implications for the
  font metrics if it is placed above?  For example, if my font currently has an EM
  Unit Size of 2048, would it be a problem if a vertically stacked h\xE1\u010Dek forced
  my Ascent value beyond this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Steve,\r\n\r\nI hope this doesn\u2019t get buried, because I\u2019m interested
    to learn more about this topic as well. The potential pitfalls of going beyond
    the bounding box has been discussed before. A Google search (site:typophile.com)
    will turn up some discussions. <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/72954\">Here\u2019s
    one of them.</a>\r\n\r\nGeorgia (on my system) use these shapes:\r\n\r\n\u010E
    \u010F \u021E \u021F \u01CF \u01D0 \u01E8 \u01E9 \u013D \u013E \u0164 \u0165\r\n\r\nAs
    far as I know, the accent should be centered on the base glyph.\r\n\r\nIn the
    case of the alternate shape in d l L t, these are specific for the Czech and Slovak
    languages and \u201C(\u2026) related to these languages culture and typographical
    heritage. The same does not occur in other languages.\u201D (Quote by Igor Freiberger.)
    Above capital L and T this shape would not make as much sense.\r\n\r\nOne possible
    solution, that I have used for other accented letters with ascenders, is to provide
    an alternate version of the base glyph that is slightly lower than other ascenders,
    and also a slightly compressed accent. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Frode - thanks for your thoughts and for the link.\r\n\r\nI like the alternate
    'short' glyph solution you mentioned.  With the font I'm currently working on
    (which does not include the Vietnamese accents), the reduction will be relatively
    minor and I doubt it would be noticeable at text sizes.   This should enable me
    to keep everything within 2048.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, is it bad practice to omit
    Vietnamese accents?\r\n\r\n"

    how much the Vietnamese beg me to do so! :)\r\n\r\nI've been experimenting with
    the hcaron along similar lines.  I think it will work just fine once I find the
    right balance between ascender length adjustment and accent compression.   "

    Variation_6181.png]\r\n\r\nThe /h/ ascender is a little lower and I've created
    two variations of the acute/grave and circumflex/caron; a taller version for lower
    case and a shorter version for caps, which I now also use for the /hcaron/, Icaron/
    and /kcaron/.\r\n\r\nNow everything sits within the 2048 metric.  "

    sticking outside the bounding box. The bounding box is, by definition, the farthest
    extant of any glyph feature in each direction. Rather we are talking about exceeding
    the em square (possibly a shifted em square)."

    using components in my example. The same accent shape does not work equally well
    in all situations (e.g. gcircumflex, idieresis). The extent to which one decides
    to make adjustments is of course personal, but I wouldn\u2019t settle f0r a bad
    solution just because it makes my own job easier."

    are done. I guess I just assumed because that's what I've been doing.\r\n\r\nOff-topic:\r\nCould
    someone tell me how I check my messages? I just got an automatic mail that says
    I got a message on Typophile, but I just can't find where it goes. When I click
    on the link in the e-mail I get to a Typophile page that says I'm not authorized
    to access that page.\r\n\r\nBut to answer your question, Thomas, from what I understand
    my messages started having a pink background a while ago because I was being so
    active that the system flagged me as a potential spammer. I think the background
    signifies the message is under review by the admin. I reported it and I was told
    that this is a mistake. I don't quite know why my messages are still being flagged,
    or why not all of them are pink. I suppose in this case it might be because my
    message was short."

    will bug the admins.\r\n\r\nDoing separate cap and lowercase accents is fairly
    common these days. But back in the early 1990s it was unusual. Even today, beginners
    will usually do just one set of accents unless somebody suggests otherwise to
    them."
