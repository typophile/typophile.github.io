body: I haven't used to many serifs in corporate identity's lately and am a bit rusty
  when it comes to the newest faces around. Can anyone help me find a beautiful classic
  serif preferably a new design with a special take on ancient italian styles (not
  french didot look = too soft and female). Keywords are classical but modern, solid
  and professional not quirky and charming. I just need to hear what you think are
  good serifs then I can look them up to see if I find something interesting then
  maybe I can provide you all with a more specific topic question:-)

  body: See what you meant about the oxymoron;-) My bad. I'll try to explain what
    I meant. I used those words more as an emotional description rather than the typical
    typographic definition of fonts. Does that make any sense? Thanks for the font
    names. I'll check them out straight away.

    I checked out the Porchez typefoundry and found some interesting typefaces in
    the custom fonts section at the bottom of this page http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/
    . Where would you put these typefaces if you where to put them in a typographic
    category. See Mackin, Mencken text (Mencken text has many of the characteristics
    I am looking for in a serif - wide, large x-height, short ascenders and descenders
    - do you know any typefaces similar to this?), Renault Identit\xE9 is interesting
    as a serif but not really?, what kind is Lion and Sitaline"
