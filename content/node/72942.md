body: "If anyone can help me or refer me to a good web designer who's familiar with
  font sites, I could really use the help...I am an independent type designer launching
  a new type foundry, but I don't have the tools to build and maintain a good site.
  And frankly I'd rather be designing new type! :)\r\n\r\nI can provide content -
  fonts, graphics, text, whatever - but I need someone with the experience to build
  it. If you wanna hit me up on here, that's cool. Or e-mail me and I'll give you
  more details: jim@rebeletter.com\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!\r\n\r\nJim"
