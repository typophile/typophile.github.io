  body: Thanks all, Grot Flama looks lovely, Geoff I'm loving Klavika all ready. Formlos,
    thanks for Malmoe looks nice too - apologies for strating a new thread, I did
    have a very quick search on 'Din Alternatives' before posting but none of the
    results shown where related to Din? But to be honest it was probably more 'user
    error' than anything else.

  body: "PTL Notes does look nice, quite condensed though, too bad there's no light
    or hairline weight. ;^)\r\n\r\nI'll have to say Klavika is definite favourite
    of mine. Today, I had recieved a booklet/newsletter that had been recently redesigned,
    the type was mostly set in Klavika along with its italic, I hope to see more of
    it and less of DIN!"
