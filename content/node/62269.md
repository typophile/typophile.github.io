  way than going to the character map to get all the letters with the ligatures and
  ear pieces? I thought it would be in the styles, but I guess not.\r\n\r\nIf not
  is there an ALT command or something that can allow me to easily place them?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nT\r\n"

  body: A bit more information. What application are you talking about? And are you
    sure you bought a copy of the font that includes the extras?

  body: Another question is which version of Avant garde do you have - some do not
    have the ligatures.
