  words, a typeface that reflects the whole of the British archipelago, rather than  the
  individual countries/nations &#40;Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, etc&#41; that
  make it up.  <BR> <BR>Matha

  body: <i>preposterous...</i> <BR> <BR>A very dramatic word that, Fredrik. You need
    to be standing, handcuffed in a courtroom to get the full effect, though. Otherwise,
    I think it&#39;s a bit strong. <BR> <BR>As to a typeface reflecting a country,
    I think that if it&#39;s used for printing practically everything in a particular
    geographical area or if it&#39;s used nowhere else, we would certainly be tempted
    to associate the place with face. <BR> <BR>For a certain number of people, Gaelic
    typefaces reflect Ireland. Caslon was the typeface used for official publications
    of the British government and at one stage was used for nearly everything else
    too &#40;I think&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Did it enjoy the same popularity in Ireland as
    in mainland Britain? Did it manage to get into the corners of Scotland? I don&#39;t
    know. <BR>Could we call it an Anglo-Saxon typeface rather than a British Isles
    one? I&#39;m thinking of its use in America. <BR> <BR>Matha

    <BR> <BR>That wasn&#39;t the direction I was heading in, Hrant. I was thinking
    more about the positive things that the different cultures of the British Isles
    have in common. We&#39;ve been living together for long enough, something must
    have rubbed off.  <BR> <BR>Matha

  body: Strictly geographical or state-based typography may be a red herring. But
    typography that reflects culture is, of course, very much a part of our world.  <BR>
    <BR>Britain, being a union of several countries and even more cultures &#40;in
    England, Cornish culture is still identifiably different to, say, Tyneside culture&#41;,
    would find it difficult to be identified by one typeface. <BR> <BR>Put it this
    way. Ask any visitor to the UK who has travelled around the various countries
    and regions about &#40;aural&#41; accents, and you begin tog et a flavour for
    just how varied the regions and cultural bases are.

    I agree that the British Isles are overflowing with different cultures and accents
    but don&#39;t forget that we&#39;ve all been communicating with each other for
    centuries in English.  <BR>I think a typeface could reflect that link. <BR> <BR>Matha.

    audience isn&#39;t just restricted to UK either. It reaches most of the Republic
    of Ireland too and is certainly something that links the whole archipelago. <BR>

  body: Mostly, any shared culture in the UK has come from the colonial capital, London,
    and that would certainly be true in the bulk of the 20th century, when the dominant
    fonts were made for Linotype and Monotype machines. So, that means Times and Gill
    Sans. <BR> <BR>However, during much of the 19th century, Scotland was a stronger
    cultural player than subsequently &#40;on the world scene, too&#41;.  <BR> <BR>So
    perhaps the 19th century &#34;Scotch Roman&#34;, which was influential on a lot
    of London founders, makes the &#34;Modern&#34; style that was so dominant in that
    century &#40;and for the first decade of the 20th&#41; a better candidate to represent
    more than just London. <BR> <BR>It must be said, however, that this style became
    popular throughout the English speaking world -- the US and the Empire, so it
    lacks an exclusive UK association.

    <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t go that far, Nick. The shared Culture of the British Isles
    is more about internal migration than anything else. The non-stop movement of
    enormous numbers of people between Ireland and  mainland Britain &#40;and between
    Scotland and the North Eastern corner of Ireland in particular&#41; has been going
    on for thousands of years.  <BR> <BR>Ans don&#39;t forget that 25% of Britons
    have at least one Irish relative.  <BR>Who&#39;s been colonising who? <BR> <BR>Matha

  body: OK, so I thought the above was pretty damn funny, but nobody responded and
    I started to wonder. I googled &#34;Galileo&#34; and &#34;inquisition&#34;, and
    found out that I had totally mis-remembered what he said when he &#34;...raised
    his voice against the ignorance of the Middle Ages.&#34; I thought it was &#34;And
    yet, it still turns,&#34; but it really was &#34;And yet, it moves.&#34;  <BR>
    <BR>So, instead of rhyming with &#34;kerns&#34; and being clever, it&#39;s just
    stupid ... and totally off-topic, to boot. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going into the corner
    to eat kerns.
