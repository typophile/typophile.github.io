<p>Is there any known florence punchcutter (i mean of course 15th and 16th century)?</p>
<p>Were type designs lets say of Jenson used in other cities than Venice, countries and were they replicas or cut by him?</p>
<p>How long metaltype could last before it was unuseable? Is it possible that Machiavelies 1513 Florence book is set with typefaces cut by Francesc Griffo?</p>

I was told, that zinc plates break at ca. 500th copy, while copper (which is softer) gives more - up to 1000 - printouts. The type probably lasted longer, for it was a mix of hard zinc and soft lead.</div>

<p>Its interesting then why its called &ldquo;The Prince&rdquo; in english (i understand its supposed to be book for someone who is going to rule, but still he had reason to call it ruler not prince).</p>
<p>I realy should find some books about history of printing and not bother you.. ive read books about type hisotry but there is not much about actual printing. My bad.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>How fast metal type wears down and has to be discarded varies — how much it’s used and how is of importance, and also the kind of quality control in place. But metal type is a kind of renewable resource, as long as the master matrices are still around, new type can be cast of those.</p>
<p>You should not be confused by the term ‘cut by’ — that refers to the master type. In short: a craftsman like Griffo creates a glyph by cutting and working a small piece of metal. During this process he checks the form by making smoke proofs on paper (using root from a candle or wick). Once the glyph is to satisfaction the piece metal is hardened (using proven techniques with chemicals and tempering). The resulting master is struck into another piece of softer metal. From this the type can be cast.
As should be evident one could strike multiple exemplars of these matrices.</p>

<p>In English, a Prince is first in line for the throne; in Latin, <em>princeps</em> means pretty much the same thing. The book was written for those aspiring to power; thus, translating the title as &ldquo;The Ruler&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t take into account the aspirational aspect. If Machiavelli were writing today, his titled might be translated as &ldquo;The Wannabe Head Honcho&rdquo;&hellip;or not.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the correction, John. I see in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulus_Manutius|wikipedia article on the son]] Paulus Manutius (or Paulo Manuzio) that he &ldquo;parted company with his uncles in 1540, devoting his output to the Latin Classics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wonder whether the publication of Machiavelli&rsquo;s <em>The Prince</em> in that year had anything to do with the rift. 19 years later, in 1559, <em>The Prince</em> was put on the Index of works prohibited by the Catholic church. Apparently it was on the list until 1966, when the list was abolished. The articles on the book report a centuries-old dispute over whether Machievelli intended his description of the ruthless ways of a successful monarch as a recommendation, or as a critique of monarchy, and implied defense of republican government.</p>

<p>Another theory holds that the book was an exposé; more likely—IMHO—it was intended as a suck-up to the man to whom it was dedicated, Lorenzo de' Medici. Then—as now—people with the job description &ldquo;historian, philosopher, humanist, and writer&rdquo; tended not to have steady work&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>(as I under stand) Machiavelli came from a fairly poor but once well-off and respected family. He managed to get a decent education but not a classical one. He never studied Greek, or commerce and banking. Florence was a centre of Greek scholarship and of trade and commerce at the time. People who wanted to get ahead studied those subjects in the same way that they go for MBAs today. He said of himself that he &ldquo;studied to script rather than to thrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the Florentine republic, he worked as a <cite>&ldquo;Secretary of the Second Chancery of the Republic</cite> and<cite> Secretary of the Ten of Liberty and Peace&rdquo;</cite>. These were a permanent, fairly high level jobs. He was involved in negotiations with Spain, France and the Papal States and was in a position to advise the Florentine Gonfalonieri (head of state in the republic) on matters of state.</p>
<p>After  the Medici overthrew the republic and re-installed themselves as the ruling family, as often happens in the wake of an hostile takeover, former managers were liable be executed or exiled - err&hellip;. Made redundant. Niccolo was dismissed from his job and shortly afterwards jailed and tortured on suspicion of involvement in a plot against the Medici. on his release, he went home to the family farm and and wrote The Prince, but not as an application for employment with the Medici. If it were, it would have been full of the kind of fawning, flattering hyperbole of the style with which a duke would have expected to be addressed by a commoner. Far from that, the book is a realistic assessment of the politics of his time that advises pretty much the opposite to what a Medici would have wanted to hear and very little about Lorenzo&rsquo;s magnificence.</p>
<p>Being a long time civil servant, he did want a job in the Medici government, but he wanted to be hired on the basis of his skill and talent in the &ldquo;art of the state&rdquo; and on his record as an honest and loyal public servant. Not his ability to flatter the nobility. (turns out he wasn&rsquo;t much of a Machiavellian himself.)</p>
<p>(I keep a copy of the Prince at my desk. If you leave out the bits about killing your rivals, it&rsquo;s still chock full-o-good advice for dealing with cubical mates. :o)</p>
<p>Thanks, William, for posting the Google Books link to Il Principe.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>We&rsquo;ve gotten off type, but Machiavelli is a fascinating character. The ambiguity of his positions along with his great brilliance, dramatic successes and failures make him intriguing. Somerset Maugham wrote a novel about him, called [[http://www.amazon.com/Then-Now-works-Somerset-Maugham/dp/0405078226/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1316187686&amp;sr=1-1|Then and Now]]—not Maugham&rsquo;s best work, but I remember enjoying it.</p>
<p>The statement that he &ldquo;tended not to have steady work&hellip;&rdquo; is misleading. He was very successful during his service to the republic. And then he was also very successful as a playwright. The Prince wasn&rsquo;t published until after his death.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I also find Machiavelli very fascinating figure.. i like to believe the theory that The Prince is sort of guerilla book to undermine Lorenzos power. I think he didnt even want him to have this book it was Machiavelli style propaganda, he just wanted people who pass this book to think its for him. Lorenzo knew all these &ldquo;ruling tools&rdquo; anyway.</p>
<p>I obviously cant use google because i wasnt able to find scan of the Prince from Aldus.</p>
<p>Well i want to use roman leters coz of course i want it to be useable/readeable today. Obvious fontchoice now for me would be Bembo, but it just seem to me maybe little overused and it somehow lost this historical feeling. Its just personal project and i dont own Bembo but ill look for some type from Aldus/Griffo that will look interesting enough.</p>
