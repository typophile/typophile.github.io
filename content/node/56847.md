body: "I'm curious if it's worth it to try to make it to Justified West, aside from
  an opportunity to hang out with a large collection of Type nerds. I need to justify,
  (ha!), the expense of registration and accommodations, if only to myself.\r\n\r\nThe
  parts all look interesting, and all of the speakers are cool looking dudes and dudettes
  of Typophile, but only one of the parts directly relates to my own profession as
  a web designer, which is Zara's part on mobile typography.\r\n\r\nWhat could I possibly
  say to my boss to try to get him to chip in on expenses? Is there anything I might
  be missing out on if I don't go?"

  body: And miss the film fest/after party? The film fest doesn't end until 10pm,
    and there is no way I want to drive from Vancouver, BC to Spokane, Wa at that
    time of night, especially after a long day. Perhaps if I flew? But that ups the
    expense again.
