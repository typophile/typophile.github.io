  the characters AND the space) so it's not contextual and easy to make.\r\nBut I
  also want it to appear at the beginning of the line or after a Tab (no space). How
  do I go about this?\r\nThanks"

    glyphs in the font, and have it appear when nothing in the class proceeds the
    two glyphs in question.\r\n\r\nNote that this could then get triggered by anything
    else that breaks the context, such as a change of font. Even a change within the
    same family (bold or italic, for instance) would do it....\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Sounds to me like what you want is not contextual at all, since the space
    is part of the ligature. Surely you just make a space_thing1_thing2 ligature?

  body: "Thanks. I'll try Thomas suggestion. It sounds like a lot of CPU activity
    just for a ligature though.\r\nNo it is contextual of some sort. This ligature
    is ment to replace a specific word not the same characters within another word.
    This word wouldn't be a word inside the text without a preceding space. But it
    still would be a word at the begining of the line.\r\nb"
