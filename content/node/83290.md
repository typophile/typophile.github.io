    your example is about banknotes in general, or the late Deutsche Mark in particular?)"

  body: I want to design a new London 2012 Olympic font with inspiration from early
    20th century Cubism and particularly London-centred Vorticism, as a chromatic
    layer font. I doubt I'll ever manage it ;)

  body: "Excellent suggestions! Would be really sad if we wouldn\u2019t deliver \u2026\r\n\r\n<cite>the
    late Deutsche Mark in particular?</cite>\r\n\r\nIt is from a set of Deutsche Mark
    bank notes which never circulated. It was done in the 60ies and bunkered for the
    case of any possible crisis or desaster. I love the fresh airy line graphics on
    it which is so contrastive to the usual bearded grandfather\u2019s heads and the
    like. \r\nWhen I would ever happen to design money myself it will be too late
    I fear, the next financial desaster coming quicker upon us \u2026  ;-) "

    that, I'd like to do design work for a magazine or newspaper. I also think it
    could be interesting to design money. I've always found money pretty...must be
    my Judaism showing through (:D)"

    world, you'll probably have to keep dreaming."
