body: "I'm new to class kerning, I read the Cabarga book step by step, read the confusing
  FL5 manual as well, made some classes, made the kern feature as indicated (which
  I put after the liga feature) updated it, and apparently everything was going fine,
  but after some more pairs, on compiling and/or generating, I get this annoying (and
  worrying) message:\r\n\r\n\"Start of new pair positioning subtable; some pairs may
  never be accessed: etc etc\"\r\n\r\nI read some threads trying to find out about
  this and someone suggested inserting a \"subtable;\" line every 100 lines or so
  in the kern feature. I did this also but when I export my PS flavoured OT font,
  once more there's the message! (grrr!)\r\n\r\nAnyone knows why this is? I know this
  might be quite a basic thing for most of you but I'm really going nuts trying to
  find out what it was that I did wrong, or else I'll have to stick to my very dated
  way: manual kerning and simple TT and PS formats and shame for the great ligatures,
  alternates and so on...\r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate your help here, I hope this
  is something simple and I'm only drowning in a glass of water... Thanks!"

  body: "I think there is something wrong with your classes. Maybe some glyph are
    represented two times in a conflicting way or something like that, making it impossible
    to access some pairs, if you perhaps have two \"commands\" for this glyph.\r\n\r\nMy
    suggestion is that you triple-check that all classes are flagged (right/left)
    correctly in the class-panel. That is, make sure the classes are logical when
    it comes to deciding which is the first glyph in a pair, and which is the second.\r\n\r\nDid
    that make sense?"

  body: "> <em>\u201CStart of new pair positioning subtable; some pairs may never
    be accessed: ...\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nThis message usually appears when a given glyph
    is contained in more than one kern class. What triggers the message is when these
    classes \u2014 that have a glyph in common \u2014 are used on the same side of
    two or more class kern pairs (within the same subtable). E.g.:\r\n<code>\r\nfeature
    kern {\r\n@_B_LC = [b];\r\n@_O_LC = [o oacute];\r\n@_ROUND_LC_LEFT = [o b];\r\n\r\npos
    @_B_LC @_O_LC -20;\r\npos @_ROUND_LC_LEFT @_O_LC -30;\r\n} kern;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe
    example above generates the following message:\r\n<code>[WARNING]  Start of new
    pair positioning subtable; some pairs may never be accessed: [b o] [o oacute]</code>\r\n\r\nThe
    warning means that some pairs downstream (second 'pos') are being masked by pairs
    defined upstream (first 'pos'). Effectively, these two class kern pairs are equivalent
    to the following singleton pairs,\r\n<code>\r\npos b o -20;\r\npos b oacute -20;\r\n\r\npos
    o o -30;\r\npos o oacute -30;\r\npos b o -30;\r\npos b oacute -30;\r\n</code>\r\nwhere
    it becomes clear that there are conflicting/repeated 'pos' commands. (BTW, pairs
    defined upstream take precedence).\r\n\r\nAll this to say that, as a rule of thumb,
    each glyph should only be included in one left kern class, and one right kern
    class, maximum. (This is by no means a strict rule, but you'll save yourself a
    few headaches if you follow it)"

  body: "I had the same problem on FL 5.0.4 (Win). It made me sick, because all classes
    were well prepared. Then I discovered, that Assistance reported a glyph duplicated
    in two classes, and one of them was removed previous day. So I understood that
    the bug may come from file \"memory\".\r\nI saved my classes, deleted them (and
    the kern feature), closed the program, launched again and imported the saved classes.
    Voila! No bad report!"
