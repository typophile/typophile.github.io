body: "I'm currently trying to design my wedding invite. I find doing projects for
  myself are the hardest and totally uninspiring, so I'm desperately scouting for
  advice and input!\r\n\r\nOur wedding is at Christmas in a 17th Century building
  in London, so there's plenty of associated imagery to go on. I'm totally bored with
  the Letterpress styled invites and really don't want to use any monograms or scripts
  like Affair/Biscotti/Bickham etc. \r\n\r\nIn fact, I want to do something typography-led
  but slightly more humorous as the wedding will be pretty relaxed. I'm thinking our
  initials made up of naff tinsel or shabby christmas lights - something a bit tongue
  in cheek.\r\n\r\nHELP!"

    being a client for a change and ask your favorite designer friend to do one for
    you? (Just be sure not to micro-manage.)\r\n"

    It seems like a good idea, but quickly turns into yet-another-thing-to-stress-about-before-the-wedding.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    in the end, they just end up in the bottom of a box of silly wedding mementos
    in the back of your closet some where that you have to drag from house to house
    for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\n"

    already. Bah! \r\naluminum - I am mega-stressed about this actually, you're right.
    Can't seem to think of anything decent that either of us agree on! Doesn't help
    that most of our friends are in the creative industry either! Agghh...\r\n"

  body: Well, if a friend of yours "offered the design as as wedding present", it
    would be so very rude to decline the offer on the grounds of your already having
    promised to do it yourself, wouldn't it?

  body: "One thing about wedding invites are that they are in fact a total pain in
    the ass, and totally uninspiring. But there are a couple of ways to make the design
    professional and clean.\r\n\r\nUsually I use white, and a nice clean type phase
    (usually serifs are best).\r\n\r\nI'd probably start with typing the words with
    times, something thats been around for a long time.\r\n\r\nAs for the layout,
    you want to keep it simple as possible, and clean as possible. Try playing with
    unity and balance, those really help in your situation. You also definitely want
    the couple's photo in your invite. Try asking them if they have a hi-resolution
    portrait of them.\r\n\r\nNext, choose your font (Don't use helvetica. Its a beautiful
    font, but its not something that'll look good in a wedding invite... although
    I might do it in mine). You might want to use something very simple and easy to
    read. Design is cool, but some people (especially seniors) find it annoying.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    Color. Choose white. I think that'll work best.\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\n\r\nKen."
