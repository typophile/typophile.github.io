  hits. \r\n\r\nOne of my art directors wants to use Swfte International's \"Circus\"
  font. \r\n\r\n1. Does anyone know if the outlines still exist for this font and
  who has the rights to it? I'd like to get it licensed.\r\n\r\n2. Can you suggest
  a similar font that we can buy instead?\r\n\r\n3. Anyone know the story behind Swifte?
  I remember them from way back but haven't heard of them in ages.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKristin\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Circus_5967.gif]"

    should be mentioned as an irony of fate that the SWFTE font forging company forged
    the fonts of the Bitstream font forging company, which had forged the Linotype
    font collection. Strangely enough, the Bitstream font forging company (and other
    font outfits, e.g. Adobe) sued the SWFTE font forging company (see the court file:
    Bitstream, Inc., et al., v. SWFTE International Ltd., Case No. 93-11068H, District
    of Mass.), i.e. \u201Eforger v. forger\u201C, so to speak, but the claims of the
    font forging plaintiffs were dismissed by the Massachusetts court.\r\n"
