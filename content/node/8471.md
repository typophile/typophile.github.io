body: Just curious - anybody know any online resources on German typefaces in use
  in the 1700s? I have a facsimile printing of a book from 1739 that I&#39;m interested
  in on mostly historical reasons and am considering scanning parts of it to make
  a font.  <BR> <BR>Theres an example of it on <a href="http://homepage2.nifty.com/kmatsum/eestikeel/img/Piibel_1739.html"

  <BR> <BR>Anybody know of any obviously similar fonts that could be similar thus
  not making the revival worth the effort?

    same foundry / printer just after I did a lot of the work - though I guess the
    fancy capitals are probably safe against having been already done ;-&#41;
