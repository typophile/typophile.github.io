  I would like to carry on, but insisting on all accented characters in headlines
  or other situations that require tight leading.\r\n\r\nThis issue is more common
  in French, German and most Eastern European languages, where the use of accented
  characters is a frequent headache.\r\n\r\nA solution is depicted <a href=\"system/files?file=stiintasitehnica.gif\">here</a>,
  but it's not general. And while Nick Shinn's <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/9373\">approach</a>
  works for umlaut, it is not usable for other accents.\r\n\r\n[I posted this as a
  new topic, because I could not find a way to include photos in comments to other
  people's posts... sorry for that, but the new Typophile, while very nice, is not
  as intuitive as the old one].\r\n\r\nMarius Ursache\r\nChief Creative Officer\r\nGrapefruit
