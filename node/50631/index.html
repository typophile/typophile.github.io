  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The Adobe Media Player came bundled with the Adobe Reader 9 download recently. Having taken it for a spin, it appears to replicate what's available at http://tv.adobe.com, only in an Adobe AIR wrapper so as to masquerade as a desktop application, apparently. 

I was struck by the typeface used in the Media Player, and at Adobe TV—it's not Cronos, or even Thomas Phinney's Hypatia Sans, the most-recent sans serif from Adobe. What could it be? 

I took a look at the lower-case "l," and it appears to match up with the lower-case "l" in the "Fl" CS3/CS4 icon for Flash. I think that the font in question must be Robert Slimbach's forthcoming tentatively-titled Gauge.

I rather like it—and can't wait to see what the entire family looks like.

Another usage of the purported Gauge appears on Adobe's Experience Design Team's blog, at [[http://xd.adobe.com]]. That site, like Adobe TV, is constructed in Flex, and uses Flash to render on-screen. (Viewing the site with the Flash 10 player shows off the enhanced anti-aliasing as compared with Flash 9, BTW.) Some folks have quibbled with the site's usability—creating it in Flex/Flash takes away some HTML/browser usefulness with regards to navigation and accessibility—but the visual effect is wonderful (especially being able to embed all the fonts, and not resorting to using the SiFR workaround with HTML for setting headlines, for instance).

So—do you think the typeface is Slimbach's forthcoming Gauge?

No, Robert hadn't played that trick yet.

It takes a while to get used to it. Some people have a hard time liking the lowercase 'g' and upper&lowercase 'K' and 'k'.

Really? I think Calibri or Corbel are closer than Trebuchet.

They can't. Unless they acquire Adobe.</div>

But inevitably, you didn't miss an opportunity to slam apple. Not sure what's more distasteful about that: predictability or inappropriateness.

Simon, can you please discontinue this incessant crabbing about Apple? It starts to seem like some kind of game card you're trying to fill. </div>

"Myriad, in particular, is used to represent many other companies, including businesses close to Adobe's (such as Apple and Verizon). Adobe wanted a fresh look that could remain unique."

I'm sure I'm not the only one that thinks it's interesting that one of the reasons Adobe has a new branding font is that their old one is associated with Apple more than Adobe? If anything this is a reason for Apple to stick with Myriad.

Seriously, I don't think I've said anything negative about Apple since their PR around Safari and font downloads (wasn't that a year ago?). Maybe your fanboyism is making you see "incessant crabbing" when it doesn't exist?</div>

Leaving the daxish a out of it, it feels just a little like a certain Underground font Paul Hunt made.

The lc l and the (relative) lack of stroke modulation are what make me think out that.</div>

The reason I said what I did is that woven into the fabric of Clean there is just a certain melody or sensibility I felt like it they shared with Underground as a result of some forms and the low contrast. For example: the g in Clean does not share a shape with Underground at all. The are different at the script or stroke level! On the other hand there seems to be an an urge to a tempered geometric reductionism which is also present in Johnston's Underground.</div>

I think MS's ads; the ones with the shopper/actors who have a free pass from the advertiser to buy anything, but have <em>no idea </em> what they are going to do with those cheaper computers (copywriter's fault), then select the cheap one even though it's going to be free — that is a funny enough Apple jab, don't you think? ;)

Glad to see you picked up a little local colour during your sojourn in blighty.

My old boss, Bill Whitehead, used to admonish me, "Nick, all around a pig's ass is pork, but not the (w)hole of it."
Never could figure out what he meant, but it sure sounded impressive!

This is indeed a <em>clean</em> design--except for the "g" with its inherently messy double-bowl construction.
Wouldn't a single bowl "g" be more consistent with the general concept and execution of the face?</div>

Anyone knows when it's released?

		<div class="commentbody">The "opinions are like ..." view that Paul references is really damaging to fruitful discussion. 

My old teacher Popper said that the way knowledge progresses is through an attitude "I may be wrong and you may be right. Lets look at the evidence and discuss it, and try to find out the truth." 

I realize on matters of taste, as opposed to fact, it is more problematic, but still there's no reason for people to take offense when they simply have different opinions. 

That's an opportunity to learn together.

		<div class="commentbody">william, my reply was directed at this line:

<em>This typeface is unacceptable. Really very bad.</em>

that's not a discussion, that's just making an arse of oneself. hence the offhand remark.

i'd much rather listen to actual criticisms such as Nick's: 'This is indeed a clean design—except for the “g”...' that leads to more fruitful discussion.</div>
