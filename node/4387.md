  body: 'the X doesn&#39;t seem like it is working hard enough to be sweating that
    much. <BR> <BR>I feel like the logo might be a little to illustrated. <BR> <BR>What
    are the 2 dots for? '

  body: I think you have accomplished the necessary drama for extreme sports, but
    it seems a little gory. Right now it looks like the &#34;X&#34; is an axe dripping
    with blood. Do you think you can make the drips look more like sweat than blood?

  body: i think that this has potential but I would take out the grafitti drips it
    doesnt really fit the logo and its kinda overused right now.&#40;comedy central,ect&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I think you should play with the X, it is a dynamic letter with a lot
    of possibilities.

  body: I like the stylized drips. Do you need the dots and the e though? It seems
    like there&#39;s too much going on.

  body: I like the hidden arrows, FedEx style. Do something subtle with those. <BR>
    <BR>And for math geek correctness, most formulae involving <b>e</b> are e to some
    other power, not the other way around. Yes, I know sometimes e is an exponent.
    That&#39;s not the point. <BR> <BR>Finally, a devil&#39;s advocate position, which
    may or may not be relevant

  body: if you do keep the drips make sure they are skewed on the same angle as the
    X. right now they aren&#39;t following the same perspective - the curves wouldn&#39;t
    be perpendicular.

  body: First of all... forget about the &#34;e&#34;. Extreme people usually hate
    math <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Try to keep the logo as simple as possible, so you could remove
    the dots too. The drips are suggesting &#34;sweat&#34; or &#34;blood&#34;? If
    you really wanna keep them, use the fourth logo. But I&#39;m not so sure this
    is a good idea &#40;keeping the dots&#41; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Why not just use a lc &#39;e&#39; as the logo? Simple and less overused than
    &#39;x&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Of course, there is that nasty association with MDMA. :-/
