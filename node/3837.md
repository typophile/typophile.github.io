  body: Thomas, <BR> <BR>I doubt there is a font to match this hand drawn  <BR>lettering,
    but these kinds of initials are often offered as  <BR>clipart. The Dover books
    are a good source. Search for  <BR>&#34;dover initials&#34; at amazon.com, or
    abebooks.com. <BR> <BR>Also, Linotype&#39;s Madame isn&#39;t so far off. Interestingly,  <BR>the
    forms are so complex, it requires several keystrokes  <BR>to create each letter.
    See -&#62; <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/Testdrive?p=96&amp;s=pPaAvV&amp;id=11650&amp;submit=display"

    out those type books by Dan X. Solo. They&#39;re in most any Borders or Barnes
    and Noble book stores &#40;if you&#39;re in the US&#41; in the art/design section.His
    books are cheap--5 to 10 dollars per--and may have exactly what you need. '

    have a look at the books Joe and Stephen recommended. <BR>thanks. <BR>/thomas '
