  run by the Memorial Arts Charity. I completed one of the five day \r\ncourses in
  London recently. It was well run and informative and I want \r\nto support them
  by recommending them to anyone interested in such pursuits. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.memorialartscharity.org.uk/\r\n\r\nI
  came away from the course with a new perspective and enthusiasm \r\nfor letter carving,
  an idea for a new typeface, and some nice, \r\nalbeit slightly wobbly, letters to
  put on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lettercarve_3414.jpg]"
