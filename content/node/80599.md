  body: "No need for brutality. It's a decent design, nothing groundbreaking, but
    it probably doesn't need to be.\r\n\r\nI see that it's a very small book, with
    quite wide margins. This gives it a classic look, which could be appropriate for
    the audience and purpose. However, I find the type size to be rather too large
    for the short line measure. You have lots of rivers of whitespace, and too much
    hyphenation. I'd sacrifice some margin, and decrease the type size a bit.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of margins, I'd be a little concerned about the tightness of the inner margin.
    Have you designed this to fit the specs of who will be printing this? If not,
    make sure you've allocated enough space for the binding.\r\n\r\nI notice a bit
    of variance as to whether you're using single-quotes or double-quotes. Decide
    on one or the other. (I understand some view these as different functions -- say,
    quoting a word vs. a phrase, or dialogue -- but to me it just looks inconsistent.)
    Personally, I prefer single quotes, but it will depend on your audience.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not a fan of the small-caps section headers. There are so many long headers (see
    p. 71), and the styling makes it difficult to read. What about reversing the styling
    of the sections/subsections -- eg, make the section headers italic (U&lc) and
    the subsections small-caps?\r\n\r\nThe section/subsection numbers (like on p.
    67) are quite distracting, and don't seem to add to the content. Generally I prefer
    to drop these unless it is reference material where someone is literally referring
    to those sections. This also seems the only piece in the book where the numbers
    are used.\r\n\r\nIn the Notes on Contributors section, I'd choose *either* paragraph
    indents or an extra linespace -- not both.\r\n\r\nIn that same section, I see
    several places where you should be using an en-dash (eg, year ranges) instead
    of a hyphen.\r\n\r\nThe Appendix (which should just be called that, since there's
    only one) needs some help. I'd ask the editor to rewrite the delegation lists
    so they are not bullet lists, but just paragraphs. Also, the last paragraph (which
    I gather is important) is getting lost: it's actually harder to read in italic,
    and shouldn't be split across the last two pages.\r\n\r\nHope these suggestions
    help a bit.\r\n\r\n--John"

  body: "Thanks for your suggestions John. All my work experience has been in web
    design and I haven't formally studied design before so this book has been a challenge.
    I've been going through books of Bringhurst, Hochuli, Haslem trying to get a better
    grasp of the details but without expert advice there is only so far I can go.
    Your feedback is just what I was looking for! I'll implement your suggestions
    and see how it looks. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\u2014Besim"

    freely available here. I doubt that publisher will be happy about it if they find
    the whole PDF on the internet.\r\n\r\nActually there's a disclaimer about this
    on page preceding \"Contents\"...\r\n\r\nI advise you to take the PDF off and
    create a new one with just sample pages. You may end up in a law suit."
