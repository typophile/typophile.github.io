  body: Top one looks like [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2|Neutraface
    2]]. 2nd is a differrent one to me mainly because of /B and /S but could be wrong.
    What's your sample origin?

    Denim Brandstore is something else, and it's live type on their website (sadly,
    I don't have the browser plug-in at work to quickly identify it). If no one else
    beats me to it, I'll ID it once I get home.\r\n"

  body: Looks like Kevin solved the 2nd one in the meantime. Funny because I thought
    about Transat but because of the apparent /B smaller bottom bowler, I gave up
    on this one. Good job Kevin!

  body: OK, I see now why I was thrown off. They used Transat but [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetanic-fonts/transat-text|Text
    version]]. Not even need to set using alternate /N as it's the default one for
    Text. Letters are also less condensed and bowler less rounded.

    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-415/alternate_cuts.html\r\nBut
    it\u2019s not a match to the sample."

  body: Ryuk, I think your ID of NeutraFace 2 is correct. As Riccardo pointed out,
    the live type on their website is close, but not the same as the sample provided.
