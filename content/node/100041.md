  body: "Can't fin anything closer than Atlas Grotesk you've already found. This /t
    can't lie to me. But you're right, numerals (/2 is even closer to Helvetica actually).
    Depending on time period of your sample, could be the original Mercator that Atlas
    Grotesk is based on: http://typophile.com/node/53257\r\nThis /a reminds me of
    [[http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/|Akkurat]].\r\nQuoted
    from Atlas Grotesk description text\r\n<blockquote>The aesthetic of Atlas was
    inspired in large part by the sans serifs of the 1950s, specifically Dick Dooijes\u2019s
    Mercator, released by the Amsterdam Type Foundry in 1957.</blockquote>"

    example) this is probably a font made in the late 20th century.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    from digital data it must be Laurenz Brunner\u2019s digital version mentioned
    in the above thread."

    invite etc. for an exhibition at Helmhaus Zurich, on show in spring 2013. The
    font is indeed Laurenz Brunner's version of Mercator. \r\nThere's also this book,
    worth checking out, although in german only. [[http://www.scheidegger-spiess.ch/index.php?page=books&view=co&booktype=order_1_releasedate&subject=1&artist=all&author=all&pd=ss&book=475&lang=de]]\r\n\r\n"
