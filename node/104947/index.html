		<div class="commentbody">Eliason - &ldquo;meta&rdquo; and &ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo; are two different things - both in language, in reality,  in philosophy and surprisingly in typography! Even if the association with one another would be the same. I would set a  	philosophic thesis, say, about &ldquo;commodification&rdquo; (&ldquo;Commodification of Human Nature&rdquo; - What a title!) in the typeface Meta. But &ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo; as a theme, even as a philosophic branch, is nothing new. In fact it is even boring! So, I would suggest a typeface in the direction of Baskerville - don&rsquo;t know exactly why, I just feel Baskerville would be right. I am too lazy now to refresh my basic knowledge in both philosophy and typography, but Baskerville-Transition Era-1800s-French Revolution, Industrialization, Diderot-Balzac-Realism, Goodbye-to-Metaphysics - that seems a right picture! So, a Baskerville-revival or something similar. Like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/baskerville-original-pro|Baskerville Ten]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/antique-ancienne|Antique]] from Storm Type Foundry.</div>

<p>Nonsense. Unless philosophy PhD&rsquo;s have changed since the 1970s, the audience is your dissertation committee. If you work at getting your dissertation published by a university press, whoever picks it up will have their own designer(s) select the typeface. It is also usually best to wait a year to try &amp; get it published, so that the work is the &ldquo;core&rdquo; of your dissertation, with further thought. It will still be out in time to count for tenure.</p>
<p>If you self-publish, &hellip; well, not advised unless you take the information to be more important than your career.</p>
<p>(We had a saying about prelims [preliminary exams] too. This is in the States, but I assume it&rsquo;s the same everywhere. To whit: &ldquo;Prelims are a puberty rite&hellip;&quot;)</p>
<p>Good luck with it.</p>

<p>My claim is that Georgia is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->relatively<!-- raw HTML omitted --> easier to read. Times (New Roman) in its version shipped with MS Office, Windows, and Mac is actually a sub-headline cut for point size 14 to 16 with a strong contrast and a condensed shaped. Georgia while it is optimised for screen is however as well optimised for body text. And it is readily available. And I bet it is to most university professors indiscernible from Times, as it shares similar traits.</p>
<p>Taken the conclusions into account from the post in the link on top, the best font might be Times Ten. The unfamiliarity factor to professors will be close to zero, so it doesn&rsquo;t distract and it is much nicer to read in body text.</p>
<p>However, I didn&rsquo;t listen to my own advise, I used Cycles.</p>
<p>And a disclaimer: I am not a professional in graphic design or typography.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>All the people telling you that you should just stick with Times New Roman are right. But unless there are explicit rules banning fancier typefaces, go ahead and use a fancier typeface. Of course, your thesis is not a book ready for press, but a manuscript for review. On the other hand, it’s the last chapter of your studies and something you might want to give your nan a copy of, so why not make it look nice? You could prepare a boring TNR version for your supervisor and a fancy one to give away, but why bother making two versions if there are no regulations keeping you from designing your thesis the way you like? As long as you make sure that it is easy to read and has wide enough margins for comments (if your supervisor happens to be of the old-fashioned kind who work with pen and paper), you should be fine. I have always seen this as a legal way of getting higher grades. Good design makes a text look more trustworthy and authoritative, even if it is just a term paper. As a supervisor, I would prefer to get the fancy version although I am not sure if I would remain uninfluenced by the nice design—but who is ever fully objective anyway?</p>
<p>FF Meta Serif is an excellent typeface, by the way. Newzald is lovely. Skolar is also a quite pleasant and fresh. Or how about FF Spinoza?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, this is silly. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when I&rsquo;m paid to design a book, I read some of it. Always the introduction or introductory chapter. The conclusion if there is one. The rest if there is time.</p>
<p>I imagine the category meta-metaphysics is wide open these days, even by the once-narrow standards of British/American philosophy. (Which I actually have sympathy for.)</p>
<p>Just by the way, all the fonts you mention have &ldquo;a fresh new look.&rdquo; That may not be appropriate, or the author may not desire it. Either would stop their use.</p>
<p>Further:</p>
<p>Now maybe I&rsquo;m a bit too rebellious, but there were things I would have liked to put in my dissertation that would have caused trouble. Not directly, because the way the politics of these things work is if the person you&rsquo;re working under says it&rsquo;s ready, it would be a slap in his face for his colleges to turn it (you) down. But a grudging pass is less help. Unless you&rsquo;ve already got several articles published, and your reputation is so established it stands on it&rsquo;s own regardless a certain coolness by the others on your committee &ndash; you can reasonably expect your director to stand behind you &ndash; you will fall afoul of academic politics.</p>
<p>But once that two-year-old  dissertation is accepted for publication, you can incorporate &ldquo;further research.&rdquo; That lets you say things you might have found prudent to leave out of the original work.</p>
<p>As far as typeface goes, I&rsquo;ll stick with the notion that if I were to design it, I would first have to read at least some of it. Part of being professional.</p>

<p>However, if you really want to use something different from Times I would definitely not use Georgia, which is a great screen font, but looks clunky in text. Miller is the related one for print.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree, it would have been nice to read a couple of pages before making typeface suggestions, but I think there’s nothing to be read so far. That’s why I suggested four typefaces that indeed have what I would call a fresh new look and that I would not find inappropriate for a philosophy thesis. It’s up to the writer to decide if he thinks that their tone fits the topic and the tone of his writing.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t think that a nicely designed thesis—as opposed to a double-spaced TNR manuscript—is going to stand in the way of anyone’s academic career. You have to stick to the rules, but if there are no explicit rules and you don’t break the unwritten ones by using a blackletter or a script typeface, no one will even consciously notice the typeface that you used. But you, as the author, will and that counts, too.</p>

<p>Going off topic here. but I&rsquo;m curious. Do you mean &ldquo;publish,&rdquo; or &ldquo;make available?&rdquo; They always were put on microfilm (by Michigan, IIRC), even way back in the 1960s, and were available in university libraries. As such, they could be cited in other works &ndash; as an &ldquo;unpublished dissertation&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t count for tenure, or much of anything else. &ldquo;Publish&rdquo; meant at least peer review, and in the old days anyway, that someone was interested enough to spend the money to get it into print and distribute it.</p>

<p>As I put it above, it&rsquo;s no longer the case that one&rsquo;s dissertation committee is the only real audience for one&rsquo;s dissertation. They are the primary audience, of course, but there are additional reasons to want one&rsquo;s thesis to look as good as possible, typographically speaking. It&rsquo;s going to be &ldquo;out there&rdquo; in a way that dissertations generally weren&rsquo;t twenty years ago.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Despite my passion for typography, and given my experience in academia, in all honesty, the typographic design of a dissertation, or any paper for that matter, is the absolute <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last<!-- raw HTML omitted --> thing I would invest any amount of time and energy into. And I’ve been single-mindedly passionate about type — to an almost diagnosable level — for over 20 years.</p>
<p>I would simply find the appropriate guidelines, no matter how fugly we may consider them to be as typographers, no matter how much “better” we know than the lay-person or academic, and do as they say. It really doesn’t matter if you find Times New Roman to be common or boring.</p>
<p>In everything I have ever written, given more time, I would revisit the content <!-- raw HTML omitted -->long<!-- raw HTML omitted --> before thinking about fonts. Any potential reviewer worth their salt is far more concerned with good research then they are “good” typography. In fact, many would probably be put off by something that strays too far from the norm.</p>
<p>Thinking about fonts instead of content is putting the cart before the horse. This is most certainly a context where content trumps form.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Why would form be irrelevant in a dissertation? I think it isn’t. And it seems inconsistent to me to consider yourself passionate about typography on the one hand and to pass up the one-time chance of showing that typography can make a difference on the other. If there’s anything that deserves to be given a form that is pleasing to the eye, it is good content. And if your content is good, it’s likely to be consulted frequently, so you might want to give “the whole an attractive appearance without imposing too much self-will”, as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mardersteig<!-- raw HTML omitted --> said. There’s nothing fishy about things looking nice. Typical dissertation guidelines—if they exist and happen to have been updated after the invention of the personal computer—seem to be more concerned with avoiding people turning in theses using 18pt Comic Sans Italic than with striving for an optimal reading experience. If you have the time to strive for this, I would. You can’t be passionate about fashion either and show up at your dissertation defense in a shell suit (although it’s all about the content).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don’t believe it to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->entirely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> irrelevant, but I do think it’s the last thing on the to-get-it-done list. Which is usually a pretty big part of finally finishing a dissertation. I haven’t met a single student or faculty member in nearly a decade of academia who was even mildly concerned with typography. When approaching faculty with such concerns, they were almost offended and looked down upon me for even considering taking time away from my research to spend on type. And that’s saying something, because I’m really passionate about it, can make a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> strong case for it’s importance, and make almost anyone feel it too.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I think it comes down to how best you can spend your time in order to ensure the greatest return on investment. And when you’re being funded by public monies, I think it best to solve the problem, and move on to the next one. To use another agriculture metaphor, it doesn’t matter what colour your farm clothes are. What’s important is how much food you can provide for your community.</p>

<p>To continue in Chris’ metaphorical ballpark, the same food will taste better if one buys it at the farmer’s market, rather than the shopping mall.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It’s obviously behind content on the to-do list, I agree. But science (or more generally: content production) is not agriculture (and not fashion either). You are not producing food and even if you were, you would still have to draw an entirely subjective line at where to stop putting time in the actual content. Is an eight-hour day enough or does it have to be ten, twelve, sixteen hours per day that you work on your dissertation? Everyone has to decide for him- or herself. But if you do have some leisure time to spend, why not spend it on typographically refining your thesis? I can well imagine this not being met with applause from faculty, but that should be your least concern. I don’t applaud everything they do in their spare time either. You could, for instance, try to come up with a layout that is based on your department’s guidelines, but takes them to a new level of typographic sophistication. If it is subtle enough, nobody will notice; they will just subconsciously find it a pleasant read. Or try to be flashy if you can stand the comments you might get for that. But to repeat myself: If you believe that typography—i.e. arranging type in a way that ensures optimal content delivery—is important (even if it’s not the main thing), you should let it come to its own whenever you can. Aesthetically I think the world doesn’t get any better from typophiles grudgingly handing in double-spaced TNR theses.</div>
