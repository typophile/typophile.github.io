  to as ordinals?)in a paragraph, do they have to be superscripted \u2014 as most
  software programs automatically do \u2014 or should they remain the same size as
  the rest of the copy?"

  body: "My rule of thumb is: if the typeface includes ordinal letters, and my line-length
    is long enough that it doesn't look too weird, I try to superscript them. \r\n\r\nTo
    me it's the same issue as with text figures. Numbers aren't <em>more</em> important
    than the rest of the text, and shouldn't be bigger than the rest of the text \u2014
    and likewise, ordinals are <em>less</em> important than the rest of the text,
    and hence, it should be smaller than the rest of the text\u2026\r\n\r\nBy the
    way, yes, they are called ordinals, \"because they are used for ordinal numbers:
    first, second, third.\" (Bringhurst)"

    I think it is just MS Word's propensity to superscript them that caused me to

    to write out the term fifth rather than 5th.

  body: "CMS (Chicago Mother of Style) says they follow the same rules as stand-alone
    numerals, which is to say, spell out 1-100 before resorting to mixing numerals
    and letters (9.8). As for superscripts, it doesn't address them specifically really,
    but it doesn't use them in its own text. I take this as a de facto endorsement
    of the policy that ordinals ought not to be superscript in running text.  \r\n\r\nNote
    that in 17.52, CMS says that it's okay to reformat superscripted ordinal endings
    when citing the title of a book (while it is not okay to spell it out if the original
    title contains number-letter ordinals). \r\n\r\n"

    In fact, aside from zero and one, they are pretty much the same size. But they
    form a \"visual block,\" and that is visually disturbing. To me, superscripting
    \"th\" etc. calls unwanted attention, even if smaller, and raises the same problem\r\n\r\nJust

    so are all the lowercase letters with ascenders and descenders. With text figures
    (old style, lowercase, etc.), though the glyph may be physically as big as the
    titling figures - most of the visual information is contained within the x-height.\r\n\r\nI
    do see your point, though, and partly agree; which is why I'm pretty flexible
    when it comes to ordinals. I don't think they \u2018deserve\u2019 to be on the
    x-height, as I - the almighty typographer don't deem them to have enough useful
    information, and being a bit conservative, I like to keep the English-teachers
    of 1729 happy. And generally, I try to stick with \u2018fifth\u2019 on numbers
    up to ten.\r\n\r\nI do like, though, the Norwegian way of dealing with ordinals.
    Instead of the \u2018th\u2019 \u2018rd\u2019, etc. suffix, a punctation mark is
    used to mark the fact that something is being counted \"It was the 5. day of the
    celebrations\"."

  body: The "rd" in 3rd or "st" in 1st is no different to me than adding an "ing"
    or "ed" to a verb to alter its grammatical status a bit. I wouldn't dream of making
    them ordinals. I cringe every time someone sends me a printout from Word with
    these distracting little "st's and "rd's" bouncing around on the lines.

  body: Yes, we would write out eighteenth. But I worked on an art book recently where
    there were a lot of addresses, and was instructed by the editor to superscript,
    for example, West 10th Street or 4th floor studio. I queried him but was told
    it was "house style" and I'd already butted heads with him over the 'e' in Acknowledgments
    (he wanted Acknowledgements, I won that battle).

  body: "\"MS Word\u2019s propensity to superscript them\"\r\n\r\nFunny thing about
    that--a couple of years ago when all the flak came out about the faked letter
    from Bush's old CO came out, one of the ways they (our own Thomas Phinney) saw
    evidence of forgery was to notice the default use of ordinals in the letter. The
    letter predated MS Word and the whole digital era so something was amiss.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS:
    I like the idea of only using ordinals if they are part of the typeface. That
    not only eliminates the leading issue but avoids the anemic look of reduced lowercase
    by the pagemakeup software."

  body: I think italic, unhyphenated, unsuperscripted (as in <cite>n</cite>th) makes
    the most sense. Italicizing the variable would be in keeping with how you would
    treat a variable if it were standing alone. And if it is italicized, then the
    hyphen is superfluous. The superscript could potentially be intrusive or mar the
    color of the text, and might make scanning the text difficult if there are superscripted
    markers for footnotes.

  body: I am currently having this exact debate at work. I try not to superscript
    the letters but am being told by non-designers they want them superscripted -
    I said fine as long as the font has ordinal letters included in order to keep
    the weighting looking correct - however if I write 12TH NOVEMBER in uppercase
    - is it correct for the ordinals to be lowercase - as these are the ones included
    in the font.
