  in use with InDesign. The problem is all those glyphs (186 of them) that don't have
  Unicode indexes, just names -- all the number variants, small caps, etc. Is there
  some way I can get FontLab to let me organize them, so that A.smcp - Z.smcp are
  found sequentially, etc.?\r\n\r\nTIA  "

  body: You can also sort by encoding, so I make a custom .enc file for each font
    project and use it to control glyph order.

  body: "An old thread, revived. As long as it did, I'll report that\r\n\r\n<cite>First
    sort by name, then sort by Unicodes</cite>\r\n\r\ndoesn't work for me. I like
    all my tabular figures together, all my proportional figures together, all my
    basic small caps together, with the accented ones in a group by themselves, etc.\r\n\r\nThe
    control I wanted was over the \"unencoded\" glphs -- those without a Unicode number.
    I guess Chris's approach would work, and Paul's might work. What I finally wound
    up doing was to paste all the unencoded glyphs into a new font window, then paste
    them back in the order I wanted. Not as good as Chris's method, because when I
    add enough more glyphs to get lost, I'll have to do it all over again."

    .enc file in which you define the order of the glyphs the way you would like to
    see them in your fontwindow.\r\n2 \u2014 In the fontwindow's Names mode you select
    your custom encoding\r\n3 \u2014 Then: Tools > Sort Glyphs > By Encoding\r\n4
    \u2014 Switch the fontwindow to Index mode to check if the index order now equals
    your encoding order.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArtur"

  body: "Artur:\r\n\r\nWorks fine as long as you are a font designer only. Might consider
    shipping your fonts with instructions to graphic designers not to use them when
    they need characters you haven't included -- like small cap D,H,S,T,Z with dots
    below.\r\n\r\nAs someone who uses type, I have found that there is no telling
    when a (graphic) designer will pick a font to set a text with transliterated Arabic,
    \"Sanskrit\", etc. If you think this a rare occurrence, just look a the current
    political scene . . .\r\n\r\nSo, I have to do make up characters the (font) designer
    left out. Worse, I have to do it on an as-need basis; as they come up. No pre-planning.
    About the only thing I can tell the (graphic) designer is such & such a designer/foundry
    absolutely prohibits modifying the font, so they'll have to use something else.
    But sure as shooting, the something else won't support these characters and glyphs
    either. I'll have to add them, and eventually get to a point it becomes hard to
    see just what is there."

  body: "I have a suggestion for you.\r\n\r\n1. Open your font\r\n\r\n2. Save an encoding
    based on the glyphs you have made. Just like that. By doing this you get the names
    of all the glyphs in a text document.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/saveeenc_5887.png]\r\n\r\n3.
    Open that enc-file in a text editor, and sort the glyph names the way you want
    them. You can take away the numbers before the names, no problem. \r\n\r\nIn the
    top of the enc-text document, you can name the encoding as you wish.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/encod_4303.png]\r\n\r\nThen
    choose this encoding in FontLab and sort the glyphs by that (sort by encoding).
    You can now have this encoding file as a base and then further on add more glyphs,
    or make changes in the order you want the glyphs to appear. Make all these changes
    in a text editor and then re-select it in FontLab for it to update."
