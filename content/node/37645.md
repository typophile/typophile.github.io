  that is specialized in doing custom made font elaborations for fashion logotypes
  for perfume packaging and so on? I mean often you see special refined things done
  by the great masters of fashion industry Armani, Valentino etc. and I wonder who
  is doing it. Is there THE ONE studio somewhere?\r\nI know Bianco&Cucco (formerly
  I think) at Milan. And then there is Baron but I heard something vague about a specialized
  studio for packaging in Paris. Maybe they do something like this also. But I don\u2019t
  recall its name.\r\n\r\nThanks for information\r\nStefan"

    are for me to pragmatic somehow too German. I am looking for the fine stuff and
    the people who do it.

  body: "Hey adnix,\r\n\r\ngood keyword: Ralph Lauren.\r\nSomeone recently has done
    a good job (yet not noticed by the masses of course) refining the main Logo lettering.
    I was very jealous. I wonder how anyone could find contacts and jobs like that
    ;-.\r\nToth doesn\u2019t seem to sign responsabile for it. Nevertheless good hint.
    Thanks.\r\nI will look for the results of your links.\r\nThanks all!\r\n\r\nStefan\r\n"
