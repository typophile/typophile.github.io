  will be posting more from other books soon. \r\n\r\nThis is, like the Jenson thread
  part of my attempt to learn what foundries did or did not have multiple sorts (versions)
  for certain letters and if they did if they used them in a deliberate possibly contextual
  way. \r\n\r\nMy investigation is far from complete but my impression is that in
  the case Aldus is that he did have multiple sorts and early on he used them in a
  more ( but not always) contextual way and later on he was perhaps less fussy.\r\n\r\nHere
  is a link to the Jenson thread\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/43627"
