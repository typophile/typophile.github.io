  now, how do you assemble a portfolio to apply for work at a type foundry? Is there
  a standard format? Is every foundry different? What are your individual experiences?
  I''m just wondering how the application process differs and what I can do to prepare. '

    use your design ability to prepare portfolio pieces which show of your type designs.
    \ Show work like logo design which demonstrates the right kind of skills. Show
    lettering and caligraphy, anything showing sensitivity to letterforms.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    Are you moved to San Francisco yet?\r\n\r\nChrisL"
