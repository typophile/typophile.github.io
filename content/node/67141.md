  body: "That's no logo - that's an image! \r\n\r\nYes it's possible - whether it's
    economically feasible or even whether you'll get decent enough results is a different
    question. This is going to take a lot of time and you'll just have to trace out
    all the shapes by hand. \r\n\r\nOr you could use something like vectormagic (http://vectormagic.com/home)
    and see how well automated vectorization algorithms handle it. But you'll probably
    need to do quite a bit of clean-up afterwards.\r\n\r\nFrankly I'd tell the client
    that this is too complex to turn into vector artwork without major simplification."

  body: "i think your customer wants a coreldraw file with this bitmap inside (hence,
    a coreldraw file). that would make sense.\r\n\r\notherwise, i don't even know
    if this is possible. i made a high detail vectormagic conversion, and the result
    is not really like the original. in any case, i have the illustrator file on my
    desktop, i can mail it to you if you want.\r\n\r\nat last, i see that the file
    name is \"tee design\": if your customer wants to print this on a teeshirt as
    screenprint, he's dreaming - or, you will have to adapt this in 3 or 4 colors...
    good luck.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: The globe is hilariously badly drawn, by someone who clearly didn't care,
    and the perspective on the inner torus suggests an odd angle that possibly involves
    more than three dimensions. Tell the client that they really don't want to use
    this image anyway.

  body: "Well it depends on your definition of \"exactly\" but yes, you're never going
    to get that vectorized to 100% fidelity of the original image unless you spend
    the next year matching each pixel in the image with it's own vector shape. That's
    simply not reasonable. \r\n"
