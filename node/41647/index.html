<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi :O)
Can anyone tell me what the position is with regard to modifying a free font for use in a visual id/logo please? :O) I've tried to find contact details for it's creator to no avail and the licence info. on the free font site states that modification for repackaging or resale is not permitted but I want to be 100% sure what I've done is ok before it's published? :O) Any help or advice very much appreciated? :O)</div>

<div class=commentbody>They're referring to if you were to take their font and change it slightly then resell it as if it were your own. If you're just using the font to create some words and you're tweaking letters that's fine. In fact that's pretty common when it comes to creating a logo.

<div class=commentbody>and if you have tried to find the designer, and have left a notice about the font name and owner on a forum like this - as proof you've tried, I don't think there will be a soul on Earth who would condemn you for doing this.
This use to be asked on all the shareware/charityware/beerware font sites - and it was pretty common. Also, you'd be amazed at how many might actually know the designer and put you in touch so you can rest... I feel like a Nyquil commercial now...</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite> Yeah, I agree with Asvetic. </cite> Yes, Andrew (Asvetic) is correct. The only caveat that I could think of ( and unlikely one at best too ) is if somebody makes a font free; but only for nonprofit use. Then if you make a logo for a nonprofit you would be 100% okay; but you would have to license the font for use in a commercial logo. It doesn't sound like that is the case here though. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I have been asked if I knew how to get in touch with Derek Vogelpohl (Shyfonts) several times. I don't know how to contact him, but did hear he went into a different line of work.
I had a flash-back to my less jaded days when I came upon a Shyfonts t-shirt while going through my drawers recently. It must be verging on being a collector's item now. Unfortunately, I have found that many of my clothes seem to shrink for some reason, if I don't wear them for a long time.
If anyone ever has a museum to the wild and wooly days of free fonts ('98-'03?), I'll donate it.</div>
