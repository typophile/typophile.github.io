  shop selling organic handmade soap. I am really stuck on what typefaces I could
  use. The client's company is sort of like LUSH, they use a lot of spices and herbs
  in their soaps.\r\n\r\nWould anyone be able to point me in the right direction of
  some typefaces you think could be suitable for such a job..?\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJames"
