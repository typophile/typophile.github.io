    Since the demise of GX fonts uppercase small caps are all we get.

    Type 1 format, with full caps in the uppercase position, and small caps in the
    lowercase position.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nfi, this illegitimate (i.e., bastard)
    format is just that. A way around the hard-wired encoding of the old Mac & Windows
    operating systems. It has nothing to do with proper naming."

  body: "<em>I can\u2019t see a difference [between] the uppercase roman and uppercase
    sc on any of the fonts in my small library.</em>\r\n\r\nBecause there is none.
    Caps are caps.\r\nBut what if you want to reformat a line of text set in roman
    to sc?\r\nDo you only select the lowercase letters and reformat, or do you rather
    select the whole line?\r\n"
