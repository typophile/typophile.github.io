		<div class="commentbody">Daniel: There are a lot of things I like about this font. My first reaction was that it would make an interesting mono spaced font. The characters are very boxy, and have the appearance of being modular. <BR> <BR>Overall, very nice. Things I would tweak: 1) the letter &quot;e&quot; seems awkward. It appears as if it could fall forward at any second. 2) the &quot;W&quot; seems too wide. 3) the tail on the &quot;y&quot; doesn't thrill me. 4) certain letters look &quot;weightier&quot; than others&hellip;although that could just be the screen.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you guys, that are some very good hints. I also think that the caps are too big and too strong. At the moment they are as high as the ascenders of the LC. I'll fix that. I'm not sure about the &quot;e&quot; i like as it is, but i try out what you suggested. <BR> <BR>I'll post a new image when its done, but feel free to post more suggestions. <BR> <BR>Thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi everybody, <BR> <BR>in the summer of 2003 after months of construction and kearning i finished my typefamily &quot;Nuri&quot; which became a huge sucess and was published in a few int. webzines and the german &quot;page&quot; magazine. Here Daniel Günther saw my type and even voted it in this forum for the best new typefaces of 2003: <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22342.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22342.html">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22342.html</a></a> <BR> <BR> The more i was suprised reading this thread about a new type designed by Daniel Günther which he acclaims to be his idea of a new sans serif. For my eyes its just a copy cat example par exellence. Sure, there are a few modifications but the overall idea is fully copied. <BR> <BR>Why is somebody wasting his time instead of  working on his own originality and ideas for stuff like that? Maybe somebody here has the answer. But most of all <BR>i</div>

I believe this is the first time that I have even seen your font in any great detail.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Daniel. <BR> <BR>I don't want to make any assumptions about your intentions or goals for this project. I've often said to <BR>myself, &quot;Wow! What a font! I wonder if I could make something similar.&quot; That's ok as a learning <BR>experience. Extremely valuable in fact. One suggestion you might take from this is to disclose your <BR>intent and any sources when you introduce the project. Not only does it save Frank the hernia, but we <BR>can also better critique and assist you. <BR> <BR>Stick around at Typophile. You are obviously a lover of type, and more than welcome. Chalk this one <BR>up to experience. I look forward to seeing your next contribution to the critique section. <BR> <BR>Randy</div>
