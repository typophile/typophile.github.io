  Finder's quick preview and in FontXplorer's preview. The font has lot's of opentype
  features, one of them being a CALT feature that, when it's on, it replaces the first
  and the last glyph of the word with alternative shapes. In the previews, the font
  is shown with this feature on, when it should be off as a default state. Here's
  a screen grab of my features with the CALT selected.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the features
  are in wrong order? How to get the previews to show the default state without OT
  feats?"

  body: The calt feature is on by default. I'd rather use Contextual Swashes (cswh).

    Alternate -buttons in Indesign and Illustrator?

  body: No, swashes (swsh and cswh) are triggered with the Swash buttons/menus in
    InDesign and Illustrator.

  body: "Oh. But then I can't have the swash feature at the same time. Would it be
    ok to make this a Titling alternate feature? Then it won't work in Photoshop,
    but might be a reasonable compromise. Any chance to sign it to Contextual Alternate
    button, but not as default? \r\n"
