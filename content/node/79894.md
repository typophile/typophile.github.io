  an image to help explain. \r\n\r\nThe black text shows how the font's kerning looks
  in FontLab. The pink overlaid text shows how the font appears in Photoshop CS5 with
  standard tracking/kerning.\r\n\r\nThe ligatures are working in Photoshop, and the
  font appears fine in Illustrator CS5, so I know the features file is working.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know what I've done wrong or what is causing this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photoshop_5063.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

    Turns out for her on the character palette where the kern setting is it was toggled
    to optical rather than metrics. Metrics is what's in the font and optical is you
    choosing kern pairs as you set the type. Not sure what the Illustrator problem
    is but from looking at the graduated difference it looks like its tracking out
    and the kerning is actually present.

    was \r\nsimply me not scaling the text correctly \r\nso I edited my original post
    and deleted\r\nthat problem."
