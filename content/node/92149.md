  a few friends. It is inspired by helvetica, but with a softer and less \"perfect\"
  look. I haven't worked much on the spacing yet.\r\n\r\nI appreciate every comment
  ... \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks, Steven\r\n"

  body: "Looks interesting & I like it. Definitely don't see much Helvetica influence
    in it though :)\r\nHad a quick look over the PDF and the /J/ seems too narrow
    & wimpy with its current hook. The tail of the /Q/ doesn't seem quite right yet
    either. Maybe something a bit more interesting or daring would suit it more?\r\n\r\nIt
    reminds me a lot of:\r\nMaple \u2014 http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/maple/\r\nNational

    you have seen so far. Below: my old version\r\n\r\nI think the top one looks better

  body: "Charming! \r\n\r\nI wonder if /b/d/p/q/ pinch narrower more than they need
    to as the bowls go into the stems.\r\n\r\n/y/ looks too fat at the bottom. /v/w/x/
    also look wide/dark.\r\n\r\nTerminals of /C/c/ seem a bit arbitrary.\r\n\r\nLove
    the question mark!"

    I quite like it actually, and I also don't mind it in the all caps setting either.\r\n\r\nCan't
    say much against the diacritics, although might be easier to see how they look
    set a bit smaller in a normal word setting, and over the proper characters :)"

  body: 'I guess I should say it was mostly on the /d/ where I saw a problem with
    the bowl/stem letters: the top of /d/''s bowl looked pointy to me. I then generalized
    it to similar letters, but actually the others may be okay (and of those big /b/''s
    I do think left might be better--right looks too flat on the bottom of the bowl). '

  body: "On the diacritics, by \u2018proper\u2019 I meant to say other character types
    such as the /i/ that may sit differently underneath. What may be passable over
    an /a/ might overwhelm an /i/. Looking at that /\xE1/, the bottom corner of the
    accent feels annoyingly close."

  body: "Thank you all for your input ...\r\n\r\n@Bert : its a font for a graphicdesign
    studio of me and my friends. We will just use it for the logotype and for headlines
    on the business cards, billings and on the website etc. Thats why I started with
    the extrablack. Normaly I start with the regular style. But we are not sure if
    we really need it. So I decided to do the extrablack first, because we have a
    \"deadline\". If I have have more time I will finish the rest of the font.\r\n\r\nIt
    looks really close too National even if it wasnt a font I looked especially on
    while designing the glyphs. And like Penn said before it altough looks a bit like
    Maple and Supria. I think you can not make font in this direction (Helvetica lookalike)
    without finding similarities to other already excisting. Every of these fonts
    is really beautiful but every font has something negligibe that we didnt like
    much. National for example has an ugly italic (in my opinion).\r\n\r\nActually
    I looked a bit at Franklin Gothic and Optima while designing. Thats how my font
    got the irregular thick stems like you can see best in the A.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_007_6473.jpg]\r\n\r\n@
    penn : I first wanted to complete the diacritics in their overall look. After
    I put them over each glyph via components I decompose the letters and change them
    with consideration in the particular letter. For example the \"A\" has slighly
    bolder and twisted accent grave than the \"a\". And the circumflex on the \"a\"
    is wider than on the \"i\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_008_4988.jpg]\r\n\r\n@
    eliason : I changed the bowl/stem on b again. Maybe you like the new version on
    the right side more!?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_006_4653.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank
    you all for your help.\r\n\r\nkind regards, steven"
