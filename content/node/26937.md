body: hello folks.  i am trying to finish a cd label that will function as the cover
  of the cd as well &#40;we aren&#39;t going to print a cover...just the cd in a clear
  jewel case&#41;.  i&#39;d like to use a small font that can be clean and clear at
  a small size.  arial narrow and verdana seem to be logical choices, but i have been
  looking at small pixel fonts, and wondering if they would come out well in print.  one
  font that i like &#40;and would like to find an equivalent&#41; is craig kroeger&#39;s  &#34;standard&#34;
  font &#40;www.miniml.com&#41;.  if anyone could recommend similar &#34;simple&#34;
  fonts that look good small in print, please let me know. <BR> <BR>best future, <BR>john
