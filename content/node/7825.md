    ... that being the reason &#40;one of&#41; it has attained &#34;next&#34; status.

  body: Dylan, as far as I can say, you can convert the fonts as long as you have
    a license for each copy that you are converting, and you let us &#40;meaning Linotype
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>
    &#41; know that you are doing it, as Si mentioned above. I don&#39;t think that
    you need to ask your personal attorney about this, that would be so expensive!
    A friendly e-mail to Linotype would be enough; those are free &#40;or at least
    as free as e-mail is

    ligature subs, et al will be available from within a Quark text pallette as with

  body: Thanks, guys. Dan, so cool of you to weigh in with so much helpful information
    &#40;especially the extra juicy tidbit about Adobe not releasing a new PS in five
    years -- I can really use that in my arguement to move this company to OS X &#43;
    InDesign&#41;. Thanks again! <BR> <BR>Couple of thoughts... You may be right about
    the first 256 working in Quark, but I was under the impression that OpenType isn&#39;t
    recognized in OS 9 by Adobe Type Manager. Anyone tested this?

  body: Dylan, I have used Avenir Next on OS9 with ATM Deluxe, in non-OpenType supporting
    Adobe &#40;old Illustrator and Photoshop&#41; applications, and it worked just
    fine, although you couldn&#39;t get at the features. I don&#39;t know any further
    details. Maybe someone else can chime in and say if with just the ATM Light plug-in
    it would work. <BR> <BR>Stuart, I don&#39;t know any details, but I have heard
    several times since the ATypI conference in Prague that OpenType features would
    work in the next Quark. I don&#39;t know what sort of interface they will use.
    Maybe someone else can chime in. Adam might know.

  body: Stuart, Quark have a team working on both Unicode and OpenType support. Although
    they&#39;re keeping quiet about exactly what they are doing &#40;no details of
    UI, for instance&#41;, it is now common knowledge that they are doing it.

    way back to Mac OS 8.6 and by ATM 4.1 all the way back to Windows 95. <BR> <BR>For
    more details, just read Adobe&#39;s OpenType readme and OpenType User Guide, both
    available at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype</a>
    <BR> <BR>Although I gather Avenir Next is available in Type 1, I thought I remembered
    Bruno mentioning some other new release from Linotype that really was only available
    in OpenType. Dan, can you refresh my memory on that? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    Next works in OS 9 with Quark 4, I&#39;ll get 10 licenses purchased right now.

  body: Thomas, as far as I know, Avenir NEXT is only available in OT format. The
    only NEXTs that I am aware of that come in not OT are Sabon NEXT and Frutiger
    NEXT. <BR> <BR>Many, but not every single one, of our new releases are OpenType
    only. <BR> <BR>Tiffany, it isn&#39;t a problem. <BR> <BR>Dylan, now your speaking
    my language! I cannot give you a definitive answer at the moment. It is 8pm in
    Germany now, and the office is closed. Howver, I can get you an answer first thing
    in the morning. Can you wait that long? We test these things, so I&#39;m certain
    that I can give you a definitive answer about Avenir NEXT&#39;s basic 256 characters
    working in Quark 4. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Dan

  body: Unless the fonts are buggy in some way, they will work. At Adobe we tested
    hundreds of OpenType fonts with Quark 4 on OS 9 and had no major issues. <BR>
    <BR>However, I do recommend examining the OpenType readme, previously pointed
    at, for known issues with specific apps and the like. There are a few niggly things
    that you may or may not care about. For example, there was some version of QuarkXPress
    where &#34;convert to outlines&#34; didn&#39;t work on PostScript flavored OpenType
    fonts. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'OK, here&#39;s the word that I got on Avenir NEXT Pro fonts &#40;the OpenType
    ones, the only ones available on the web site&#41;: they will work in Quark 4
    on Mac OS 9, but you will only have access the basic 256 character set &#40;just
    to remind you one more time&#41;. No OpenType features will work, as was mentioned
    above. To be safest, our technicians recommend that you install these fonts directly
    in the &#34;Fonts&#34; folder in your Mac &#34;System Folder.&#34; <BR> <BR>On
    a slightly different note, we apparently DO have some PostScript versions of Avenir
    NEXT floating around the office. They are currently not for sale via the web site,
    but you still should be able buy them by contacting a Linotype sales representative
    directly at <a href="mailto:info@linotype.com">info@linotype.com</a> <BR> <BR>However,
    Dylan, I would <b>not</b> buy those PostScript fonts if I were you. Here&#39;s
    why: the beauty of the OpenType fonts is that small caps and old style figures,
    as well as the extended character sets for non-western european languages, are
    all included in one font &#40;i.e., &#34;Regular&#34;&#41;. If you wanted all
    of these in characters in a PostScript font, it would actually be four separate
    fonts: regular, regular SC, regular OsF, and regular CE.  <BR> <BR>We would of
    course charge more money for four fonts than for one &#40;but I don&#39;t know
    how much more&#41;. Unless I absolutely needed these features right now, I would
    buy the OpenType fonts. Its gotta be inevitable that your company will eventually
    upgrade, right? Even the next Quark will be OpenType compliant. Plus, you could
    probably make your own PostScript extractions from the OpenType font data for
    your company&#39;s use, and still remain within the EULA provisions, as was also
    discussed above. In short, buying the OpenType weights is an investment in your
    design future, even though it will sadly cause a few problems in your short run
