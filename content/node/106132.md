  you know any online tool (or any clever method) to display languages list which
  are supported by the font? I'm making one and it contains German, Polish & Spanish
  glyphs, but I don't know which other languages are using the same glyphs as mentioned.\r\n\r\nHow
  can I check it ?\r\n\r\nCheers and thank you in advance.\r\nLucas"
