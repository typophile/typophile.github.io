body: "Can someone help me out with a potential OpenType problem?  I say potential
  because I really don't want to go the OT route unless absolutely necessary (because,
  1. I know nothing about it, and 2. I can't even afford to upgrade from TypeTool
  to Fontlab right now).  Here's the problem...\r\n\r\nI want to work with an indigenous
  script that is prone to be written with continuous connecting bottom segments, like
  a retro-style, futuristic, boxy script (think Fontdiner.com logo).  Each letter
  has two forms:  1. within the word (that is, connected to the letters appearing
  before and after it), and 2. terminal position (a connection line to the preceeding
  letter, but no terminal line after the final letter).  \r\n\r\nI could simply design
  two entire sets, and this writing system has no UC/lc distinction so using the shift
  key to vary between forms is not out of the question.  Of course, a standard keyboard
  layout has yet to be established for this language (it has only just recently entered
  the final stages of Unicode assignment).\r\n\r\nAnyway, how does OpenType work in
  this situation?  Will it be practical, or should I just resort to typographic tricks?
  \ (The script has a connecting device similar to Arabic Tatweel--a solution perhaps,
  but I'd hate to make someone type this ancilliary character after every single letter
  in a word.)\r\n\r\nThanks."

    is not yet finalised in Unicode, I think your best bet is to discuss this question
    with someone at Microsoft Typography (I can put you in touch with someone, if
    you like), since they are likely to be the first people supporting the script
    using OpenType Layout, and what you need to do is figure out with them what approach
    they will take to the layout. There is some flexibility, of course, in how you
    make a particular OpenType font work, but you need to understand what the shaping
    engine model will be for the script, as this will determine what OTL features
    will be applied when an application encounters characters from this script."

  body: "Good, John, I was hoping you'd see this.\r\n\r\nThe script is N'ko. It's
    West African in origin (and only a little over 50 years old!) with somewhere around
    20 million users. As a side note, the Vai script and language was granted Unicode
    assignment (and attention from SIL) before N'ko--go figure, just under 100,000
    speakers.\r\n\r\nYes, I'd greatly appreciate you putting me in contact with Microsoft
    Typography on this one.\r\n\r\nThanks John.\r\n\r\nA."

    Nelson and Peter Constable.\r\n\r\nRegarding priorities in Unicode encoding, it
    all depends on someone submitting a proposal for a script encoding, not on the
    number of speakers of a language. Also, scripts with fewer users are sometimes
    easier to get proposed and approved than those with more speakers, because there
    are fewer bodies with a stake in the encoding. As I understand it, the N'ko encoding
    involved considerable academic and government activity, which is a good thing
    but also time consuming and expensive. A script like Vai can be proposed by one
    or two experts and make its way through the review and approval processes relatively
    quickly and inexpensively."

    Constable notes that the N'ko proposal has been approved for inclusion in Unicode,
    but corrects your remark above re. Vai. Vai has not yet been approved; indeed,
    a proposal has not been submitted yet, but is in the works."
