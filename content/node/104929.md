  but now i want to get into serious font design.\r\nI've used FontForge and finally
  decided to purchase Glyphsapp. For my first try, instead of design a font from scratch,
  I decided to digitalize a font from an old Dan X. Solo catalog I found in my house.\r\nMy
  work is almost complete and I want to show it for some critique but I'm concerned
  about wether I have the right to publish for educational purpose or don't."

    looks as though the work belongs to someone else so digitizing it would in fact
    be copyright infringement.\r\n\r\nThere <em>may</em> be an exception for educational
    contexts, but I would have to give the book a look to provide you with any meaningful
    insight.\r\n\r\nI would recommend contacting the publisher."

    with, and not legal advice :) \r\n\r\nThere are no copyrights on typeface designs
    in the USA, so doing your own digital drawing of a typeface design in the USA
    is legal. Dan Solo used this fact himself since his stuff is revivals of early
    type designs :) But countries in the EU have a 25 year copyright on typeface designs.
    So it rather depends on where you are based.\r\n\r\nHowever, the educational value
    of doing outline drawing over the top of an existing typeface design is rather
    low. If you want to post work for review, you'd be better off making your own
    typeface design from scratch :)"

    body: "Hi. Thanks for the advice. I know working the value I can get working over
      other's design is limited compared with designing a typeface from scratch. However,
      in this case the sheet included 62 characters (26 lowercase, 26 uppercase and
      10 numerals) the challenge was study the basic morphology and create a complete
      Basic Latin set with diacritics, punctuation, symbols, lining numbers, tabular
      numbers and old style numbers. My main goals were:\r\n1.- Learn to use Glyphs\r\n2.-
      Learn about how to set digital type (space the font, kern the font, hint the
      font\u2026)\r\n3.- Set OpenType options like alternates.\r\nI would recommend
      the experiment since I didn't have to worry too much about morphology and focus
      in the techniques and technology involved."

    the font, and release it publicly, it will likely come back to haunt you if you
    ever decide to pursue type design as a career. Keep at it, but keep this one to
    yourself. '
