  body: "This looks like a sample from TV or a film, and possibly something older
    than the 60's. I'm guessing that it was hand-lettering or film type. The most
    similar digital font I found was [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?&q=Waldstein&x=17&y=4&sample_text=NOTICIARIO%20ESPANOL|Waldstein]]
    from Fountain. It does not have the top serif on the A, but few fonts do. I tried
    to match as many letters as I could, and I think the A is the only one that would
    need much modification.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks! The capture is from a Spanish newsreel from the 1940s, so it's easy
    to imagine it was either custom or a font that didn't find its way to the digital
    era.
