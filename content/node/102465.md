  could say that I'm a french graphic designer who love typography.\r\nI probably
  don't have the skills to draw one of my own but I'm working on it.\r\n\r\nReally
  sorry if my english is not perfect, I'll try to explain my issue of the day.\r\nWith
  a friend of mine we are fixing some bikes and we are trying to get the logos, which
  are stuck on it, right.\r\nHere is the image of the aerospace contour logo. It looks
  like a bauhaus but not entirely... a mix between Bauhaus and ITC Avant Garde...\r\n\r\nTanks
  in advance if you can help!"

  body: Whatever font it is or wherever they started, it is deeply rooted in  "[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bauhaus/|Bauhaus]]".
    Many freebies (an endless list actually) share the same backbone ([[http://www.dafont.com/vomzom.font|Vomzom]]
    is one of them). Having a look to [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Techno
    > Sci-fi]], [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304|Techno > Various]] and [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501|Basic
    > Sans serif]] sections at DaFont could be helpful to spot either an alternative
    or a match. Good luck!

    isn't a match because this was designed in mid-80's...\r\nDafont wasn't invented
    back then!"

  body: "It looks pretty much custom made to me. A bit of AvantGarde + Chalet (from
    House ind.) and some Illustrator tweaking should do the job well.\r\n\r\nCa me
    parait fait sur mesure. Un peu d'AvantGarde et de Chalet (de House ind.), et un
    peu de bidouillage sur Illustrator devraient faire l'affaire."
