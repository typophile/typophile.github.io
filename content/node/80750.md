  is an original design by Alex Kaczun. The inspiration for the typeface came from
  the Toyota SCION logo, which bears its name. In Alex's own words, \"I loved the
  simplicity, proportions and hi-tech look of the logo and decided to create an entire
  new design series based on its unique look\". The fonts come in 5-flavors: thin,
  light, regular, bold and black. All the font weights where designed systematically
  on tabular widths so that the user can make adjustments to overall type color without
  changing the line length.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Alex Kaczun has provided us with several
  alternate glyph substitions to further enhance the overall appeal of this contemporary
  new design. The large Pro font character set, which supports most Central European
  and many Eastern European languages, makes this typeface series ideally suited for
  display copy as well as text composition. In the near future, Alex plans to include
  a narrow, compressed and ultra expanded, along with true-drawn italic variations
  to further expand the possibilities of this great new display series."

    it till it breaks...\r\n\r\nI realize that it seems absurd to expand 'SCION',
    but I was thinking of going about this in a slightly different way.\r\n\r\nInstead
    of just proportionally expanding each and every glyph in font as in line 2 above.\r\n\r\nI
    think that I will adjust selective aspects of each glyph in a way that will create
    yet another interesting visual variance, like in line 3 above.\r\n\r\nWhat do
    you think?"

    brands) might owe a little something to Porsche, going back to at least the 1950s.
