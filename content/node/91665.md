    you can dream of it, you can do it.\u201D</strong>\r\n\r\nThe issue of font choice
    for academic editing can be sliced down to several questions worth of consideration,
    and of differentiation.\r\n\u2013 What good practice is kinda established in a
    certain field of study?\r\n\u2013 What character repertoire is required?\r\n\u2013
    What font functionality is wanted?\r\n\u2013 What typographic style is preferred?\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you gather from that listing that the matter is fairly complex. You scientists
    ought to have a predilection for that sort of thing. So let\u2019s go ahead.\r\n(Just
    for the records: those of you asking us for \u201Cwhere do I get everything for
    nothing\u201D \u2013 just re-think about your choice of forum).\r\n\r\nJust a
    few thoughts upon this \u2026\r\n\r\n\u2013 If you are clever enough, you can
    nowadays exploit your average system font collection to a much higher degree than
    this would have been possible ten years ago. Chapeau.\r\n\r\n\u2013 You may well
    be better off if you can determine exactly what you actually need. Hence, this
    gives you a certain position for then searching the wild \u2026 and finding something
    appropriate.\r\n\r\n\u2013 If  you ever happen to find fonts of interest which
    leave *something* to be desired in terms of your specific needs, consider this:
    fonting is a very demanding business: conception, research, design, crafting,
    encoding, feature programming, mastering, editing, testing, distribution, support,
    \u2026 \r\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re not expecting to get all this at a $9,99
    ticket, or just for free.\r\n\r\nEveryone at the academies expect from their computers
    (and fonts) that just happens what they want to happen. But academies still hardly
    consider what is actually neccessary for the fonts to perform like it is wanted.
    Few exceptions of course, not to mention all the nerds who are labouring during
    dark hours on their own \u2026\r\nHowever, I maintain that \u2013 in a rather
    broad perspective \u2013 our academies still need to realize what potential actually
    lies in script science and fonting development. A potential the big share of it
    is still unearthed to the very day. But \u2018typography\u2019 has no reputation
    as a true academic discipline. There is no logic behind that, it is just an old
    habit.\r\nThe dark side of that moon is: requests like \u201Cwhich is the proper
    font choice for my dissertation?\u201D are ever more increasing nowadays, as far
    as I can tell.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 pence.\r\n\r\n  \r\n"

    fonts already on my system, just for tests, and haven't found much of a combination

    is, presuming headings to be bold.)\r\n\r\nI've tried Stone Sans Semi-Bold and
    Baskerville, it seems unusual. Heuristica/Utopia is really nice though, for both

    Do you really mean leading? Pretty sure you can change the leading in LaTeX...
    You can in plain TeX, which I used for years, with our own set of macros. That's
    all LaTeX is, TeX with a bunch of macros...\r\n\r\nAt some level, if you really
    care about typography, you will have to address font editing programs. Most of
    us start with kerning (which you can do in plain TeX) and move on.\r\n\r\nYou
    do not need bold for headings. I frequently don't use bold for either subheads
    or chapter heads. Type size, extra white space, etc. are all alternatives to bold,
    and often give a much more harmonious page.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you care, you're
    going to have to get a notion about the elements of interior design. I'd recommend
    Rich Hendel's book <cite>On Book Design</cite>. Rich is interested in how designers
    think, not a set of rules. Books about design that are *prescriptive* -- a set
    of rules -- may give you a start, but if such rules would always work, design
    could end with a program, and the profession wouldn't be needed.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nYou
    may not care enough about such things to study them, but curiosity is never ending.
    I spent an hour with Donald Knuth at ATypI in Boston, and all we talked about
    was organs (the musical instrument). That man's range of interests is incredible... "
