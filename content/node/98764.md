  body: "Even if I have to agree with Nick Cooke, I guess it would possible to find
    a decent alternative for this one, may be simply customizing /G (removing horizontal
    bar and adding a flare serif by slightly curving bottom right part).\r\nSome suggestions
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/|Proxima Nova Black]]
    (mixing Regular, Condensed or Extra Condensed), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-profile/|Profile]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/gibson/|Gibson Bold]], [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008|Gotham]]
    (also mixing styles Regular, Narrow, Extra Narrow...), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/polarband/|Polarband]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/montreal/|TS Montreal]] or even a manipulated
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/|Futura Extra Bold]] (but you'd have
    to entirely redraw /G or to borrow it from one of the previous')"
