body: "My sister and her family went to Spain and brought me a picture of a sign instead
  of souvenirs. When Spanish and Euskara were both used on signage, the Euskara portion
  was always in the font seen below. It's not exactly standard signage looking type,
  or at least not very official looking. Does anyone know what the deal is with this?
  From what little I've found out, Euskara (the Basque language) is in the family
  \"not Indo-European,\" but uses the Latin alphabet. Is there a reason to use this
  particular face other than to distinguish between the two languages?\r\nLarger sizes
  can be seen <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/1saac/124431217/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/euskara.jpg]"
