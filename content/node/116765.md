  body: "Nebiolo absorbed several other foundries after 1889 and for some time the
    company was called Societ\xE0 Augusta, but it reverted to Nebiolo&Co in 1917.
    See Luc Devroye's Nebiolo page http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-36780.html. So this
    font could have been in a Nebilo catalog. The Klingspor musueum has listed many,
    & perhaps all, of the types ever made by Nebiolo  http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftgiessereien/Nebiolo/Nebiolo.pdf
    but does not show any images. So the name could perhaps be on this list.\r\nProbably
    not digitized.\r\nSome substitutes. Cognac http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/cognac/
