body: 'Does anyone know anything at all about various U.S. license plates and the
  faces used on them &#40;does anyone care as much as I do&#41;?  I&#39;ve noticed
  three basic categories for plates, which I classify thusly:   <BR> <BR>1&#41;Non-designed...  these
  appear to have been fashioned strictly with the limitations of production-machinery
  in mind, it would seem that almost no thought went into psychological issues &#40;legibility,
  etc.&#41;--I&#39;ll let this class be represented by the state of Ohio &#40;but
  it seems Class 1 is actually the style used by most states&#41;. <BR> <BR>2&#41;Semi-designed...  at
  least SOME thought beyond mechanical constraints went into the design of these plates
  &#40;the attempt to make the forms more human has resulted in these plates being
  significantly more legible than Class 1 at great distances&#41;--represented by
  West Virginia&#42;. <BR> <BR>3&#41;Fully-designed...  I&#39;ve seen only one state
  so far that fits this category--Virginia.  These plates are amazing, their face
  is both seriffed AND modulated &#40;and legibility at great distance is excellent&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Which brings me to my point...  I contacted the Ohio BMV about the plates&#39;
  type designer, and the response was that the 3M Corporation did the work.  I don&#39;t
  believe, however, that my question was fully understood.  I think 3M may have devised
  the production &#40;printing&#41; method, but not the actual typeface design. <BR>
  <BR>And my question to all of you...  I also contacted the Virginia BMV about their
  plates, but an official quickly wrote back that he didn&#39;t know who designed
  the face--do any of you know who designed Virginia&#39;s license plate typeface?  I&#39;m
  dying to know. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;In an especially ironic twist, Ohioans and
  West Virginians are perpetually feuding over who&#39;s the classiest and most metropolitan
  of the two, Ohio usually wins, I think &#40;is it because I live in Ohio?&#41;,
  because we have cities like Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati.  West Virginia&#39;s
  license plates are designed better than Ohio&#39;s, they just look better too--and
  this is funny because Ohio would never want to be second to West Virginia in anything
  &#40;I don&#39;t feel this way--not an Ohio native&#41;.'

  body: A car with Virginia plates is parked down the street as we speak, I wish I
    could go take a photograph for posting, but I&#39;m sure the owner wouldn&#39;t
    be thrilled if he saw me in the act. <BR> <BR>Virginia plates themselves are fairly
    nondescript &#40;white plate, navy blue lettering&#41;, which actually helps to
    showcase the typeface &#40;and, in my opinion at least, increases general legibility&#41;.  I
    think this whole structure was carefully planned, the state of Virginia seems
    to know what they&#39;re doing. <BR> <BR>On your advice, I&#39;ll persist for
    an answer.

    target="_blank">www.worldlicenceplates.com/usa/US_VAXX.html</a> <BR> <BR>In this
    case, I think it&#39;s good.  You&#39;d think that seriffed forms would not be
    the best choice for an object that requires easy recognition and travels at high
    speeds &#40;or moves at all&#41;, but just a few days ago I had the rare opportunity
    to observe three cars on the highway just outside of Cleveland--one from Ohio,
    one from West Virginia, and yes, one from Virginia.  I realized that some cosmic
    force was allowing me the chance to test legibility among the three classes I
    just listed above; so I slowed my speed and watched...   <BR> <BR>-At about 25
    feet legibility was comparable in all three classes. <BR>-At around 35 feet Ohio
    was seriously losing ground. <BR>-At about 45 feet Ohio was entirely out, West
    Virginia was OK, and Virginia was clear as a bell. <BR>-Past 80 feet Virginia
    was at least discernible, while Ohio and West Virginia were difficult to distinguish
    their state of origin. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure that too much research has been
    done in this field, doesn&#39;t seem that way.'

    proven positive in this field. Please bring back classic license plate &#40;non&#41;

  body: I am a graphic designer and I SOOOO wish we could go back to the old 2-color
    embossed plates. But you can&#39;t blame the designers, things like that have
    to be dumbed down for the tasteless committees that make these decisions.  <BR>
    <BR>At least they aren&#39;t as ugly as our new money!!!

  body: Hrant, <BR>Yes, hat is the actual font.  I went to the Virginia DMV page &#40;motor
    vehicles&#41; and selected their vanity plate link.  It alows you to type in whatever
    will fit on any VA plate and will create the plate on-the-fly for you.  There
    are actually many, many more plates to choose from. <BR>&#60;<a href="https://www.dmv.state.va.us/dmvnet/online.asp"

  body: Perhaps an interesting note on this discussion--and maybe an impetus for the
    particular font chosen for the plates--Virginia was the first state to actively
    and very eagerly encourage residents to personalize their plates &#40;cheap too&#41;.
