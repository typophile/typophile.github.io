body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI've been working on my own personal logo for my freelance
  graphic design company.\r\n\r\nI feel I'm headed in the right direction at the moment.
  However, I'm having trouble making the lowercase 'g' NOT look like a lowercase 'q'.
  \ \r\n\r\nI'd also like to get your thoughts on the overall direction - I'm loving
  it so far. It also looks somewhat familiar, I wanted to make sure nobody has aleady
  seen this direction before.\r\n\r\nMy company name is DG Design (my Initials).\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    was invented by two people as well, so i hope this doesn't discourage you. (plus
    this is only one letterform instead of two)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/G_3466.jpg]"

    i read as \"da\".\r\nBaloons aren't really unique anyway, but using them to make
    letterforms is more \"original\"."
