  difficulty in persuasion is overcoming the confirmation bias, where people selectively
  seek evidence that is consistent with their prior beliefs and expectations. This
  biased search for information allows people to analyze new information in an efficient,
  but shallow way. The present research discusses how experienced difficultly in processing
  (disfluency) can reduce the confirmation bias by promoting careful, analytic processing.
  In two studies, participants with prior attitudes on an issue became less extreme
  after reading an argument on the issues in a disfluent format. The change occurred
  for both naturally occurring attitudes (i.e. political ideology) and experimentally
  assigned attitudes (i.e. positivity toward a court defendant). Importantly, disfluency
  did not reduce confirmation biases when participants were under cognitive load,
  suggesting that cognitive resources are necessary to overcome these biases. Overall,
  these results suggest that changing the style of an argument's presentation can
  lead to attitude change by promoting more comprehensive consideration of opposing
  views."

    own opinion highly. Market researchers have long know that different answers can
    be obtained by framing the question differently. Similarly, the manner of presentation
    can have an effect on how well or how badly the information is conveyed.\r\n\r\nSo:
    is disfluency some form of deliberately-introduced cognitive dissonance and, if
    so, how is this dissonance achieved?\r\n\r\n"

    is not accurate to the point of the article. It is not that novelty is persuasive,
    but that familiarity allows this confirmation bias, and therefore novelty allows
    more play to the rational intelligence. It is not the novelty itself is being
    persuasive, but allowing a good argument a better chance of sinking in.\r\n\r\nNovelty
    in advertising has a related effect, catching attention, and therefor creating
    a better chance for the punter to read the message."

    thread I noted above.\r\n\r\nThe idea of disfluency leading to positive effects
    is not new. It seems to be implicit in the early 20th-century notion of ostranenie
    (literally: <em>making strange</em>) or defamiliarization associated with the
    Russian literary critic Viktor Borisovich Shklovsky. See: \r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamiliarization\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Shklovsky\r\n\r\nI
    would have some questions about the use of \u2018[dis]fluent\u2019 in these studies.
    For example, is it meant in roughly the same sense as by the authors of the paper
    featured in this thread:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/84429\r\n"

    a better chance of sinking in.\"\r\n\r\nThat's the argument made by the researchers.
    But the summary provided supports Nick's take just as well as theirs. Theirs has
    an interesting theoretical basis.\r\n\r\nNow, one could design an experiment specifically
    to distinguish the two hypotheses. For example, what if the question at hand is
    one for which the subjects have no preconception whatsoever?\r\n\r\nI suspect
    Nick is right, in part based on the recent study involving remembering information
    about imaginary alien species.\r\n\r\n"
