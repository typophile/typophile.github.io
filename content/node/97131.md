body: "Although the body text in this rubbish PDF strikes me as Miller, the oldstyle
  figs seem to be from somewhere else. First: Is this Miller? (with the alternate
  cap R) and, Second: Where are those figs from? Miller seems to be strictly modern
  in the fig department. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.oakknoll.com/resources/bookexcerpts/108979.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oakknoll.com/resources/tableofcontents/108979.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks. "

  body: "Yes, the body text looks like Miller and strangely enough the old style figures
    looks also like Miller (modern) figures, although I can't find any official version
    of Miller with old style figures.\r\nI can only assume this is a custom or modified
    Miller version."

  body: "[[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Miller/styles/|Miller Display]] has this
    R and also these OS numerals. The caption on your first sample looks like another
    typeface, maybe Walbaum?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
