  I'm working on a logotype for a company that sells tailor-made suits. The logo will
  be a traditional crest, combinated with a modern/straight sans-serif font. now I'm
  using \"Eurostile\", but I'm searching for some other solutions...or maybe my chosen
  font is okay? \r\nc&c highly appreciated!\r\n\r\nthanks alot,\r\nchri\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/atelierimage_4480.jpg]"

    that G looks a little technological, rather than textile. I prefer <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/45-light/charmap.html\">Univers</a>
    myself, but I'm sure others will have more educated suggestions.\r\n\r\nLooks
    like you do need to work on your kerning a bit, though. Tighten up AT, loosen
    TE, etc.\r\n\r\nI like the branding style! I'd buy a suit there if I weren't a
    broke kid fresh outta college!"

    it a modern touch...that's what I'm looking for! \r\n\r\nI tried some other fonts
    - what do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/atelierimage2_4081.jpg]"

  body: "Hi Chri,\r\n\r\nwell done on the mark! When it comes to your type choices
    I prefer Agenda as it picks up the stroke width of the crest and also looks more
    balanced (L & R). Have you tried a different placement of the crest - maybe a
    traditional:\r\n\r\n     [CREST]\r\nATELIER IMAGE \r\n\r\nThis could help with
    balance issue.\r\n\r\nGood luck and looking forward to see how this evolves.\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "I agree about Agenda catching the stroke width well - that whole arrangement
    really seems to pop. But is anybody else bothered by the straight tail of the
    R in Agenda? It seems to me that it fights a bit with the straight descent of
    the crest ... which, I guess, brings me back to Univers again. Man, I feel like
    a one-track tape.\r\n\r\nChri, were you saying you like the G in Eurostile? Because
    don't forget that I'm speaking in a vaccuum, whereas you actually know the company.
    Maybe a sleek modernist/industrial look <i>is</i> what you're going for, and I'm
    off the mark.\r\n\r\nOnly you can prevent forest fi ... I mean, decide. :)"

  body: "How will this be produced? I am imagining that it will be used for embroidery
    occassionally or at a small size, if that is the case I would guess that some
    of the elements won\u2019t work too well, specifically the needle and fleurs de
    lys. While Agenda and Advert fit the weight of the shield and crown you might
    need to work on simplfying the fleurs de lys (maybe going down to one) and making
    the needle larger, whether by redrawing it at a more foreshortened angle or by
    cropping to the eye and thread.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: 'I would loose one the fleurs de lys and make the other larger. Make the needle
    bolder and no thread (thread is implied). It almost also screams for something
    else in the banner. How about making it thirds, one third a needle one third a
    fleurs de lys and the last third a pattern example: like a herring bone. Sort
    of a peace symbol division.'
