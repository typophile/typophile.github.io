  TREMBLED. We are currently restoring this film and in the process will need to re-create
  a number of the original titles which are no longer present in the existing copies
  of the film. Of course it would be wonderful to find a perfect match for this font,
  but even a very close approximation would be extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!"

  body: "I recommend Cushing Two, a recreation of a type by that name from circa 1900.
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/cushing-two/\r\nThe intertitle lettering
    artist seems to have been influenced by the typeface. In any case the character
    of the letterforms, which look almost handlettered and are almost monotone with
    small serifs, is a good match. \r\nYou can use it as is, but if possible the width
    should be expanded to perhaps 120% and a common ampersand substituted for the
    one in Cushing Two.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CushingTwoItalicWidth120pct_5513.jpg]\r\nDon"
