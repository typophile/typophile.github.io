body: "I worked for a small graphic design firm for a little less than three years.
  I was laid off last week due to lack of work in the studio and I was the only employee.
  While working for this studio my main focus was print production. \r\nThe few times
  I was allowed to take a stab at designing something, the two creative directors
  shot it down or made drastic changes to my designs. \r\n\r\nSo, I'm basically going
  back in time and need to sell myself again, and like before my last job I have only
  a very small portfolio. I've been struggling with re-creating my stationary/portfolio
  package for a couple days now.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to make the ultimate new resume
  to start, but I have designers block. \r\nI have some stuff I started, but it doesn't
  look great right off and that discourages me very badly. \r\n\r\nI just sit and
  stare at the screen and freeze up. Then I look at other designers online and see
  their awesome stuff and then I look at mine and it looks so flaccid and lacking.\r\nI
  just keep thinking \"maybe I just suck at design...maybe I should just be a secretary...\"\r\n\r\nBut
  in my heart I want to be a designer. My boyfriend reminds me that I have a talent
  for art and that I have made cool designs in the past. But hearing it from him over
  and over is hard to believe after a while. So he pointed me to this site and said
  that he had seen some respectable people here that could give it to me straight.\r\n\r\nSo
  finally, please help, if you could, to get me out of this rut.\r\nAny info, stories,
  etc. you guys could contribute is greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks, and hope
  to talk here often.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    know exactly what you mean, I've been there many times.\r\nAt the risk of sounding
    trite, I'd suggest that you don't sit at the screen at all. For a lot of us that
    can end up either shutting down all creativity, or steering us towards creating
    something stale. \r\n\r\nInstead - sit down at a table with a sketch pad and pencil
    and just draw, doodle, scribble, etc. Even if you're \"not an illustrator\", the
    act of making marks on blank paper can stimulate creativity. Just try to push
    yourself to make marks on the paper, no matter how \"outside the envelope\" they
    seem, and see what you end up with. You may end up with beginnings of ideas you
    didn't know you had, or it may even put ideas in your head that you can then jump
    on the computer to execute.\r\n\r\nDon't give up, good luck.\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "Hi Darmock,\r\n\r\nThe danger with sitting solely in front of a computer
    is that what you make is very heavily influenced by the computer's capabilities.
    We end up being restricted by the way computers work. I'm not saying that there's
    stuff you can't do on the computer, but certain things are more difficult to do
    than others, and as a result these things come less fluidly when you are trying
    to be nothing but fluid whilst coming up with ideas. Pen and paper remove so many
    barriers when pouring the contents of your quivering brain out into the world.\r\n\r\nI
    can't draw for peanuts but the beginning stages are meant to find good ideas,
    and not necessarily look good. So I suppose you just have to look past the appearance
    to begin with if it looks crud, and focus on the idea behind it.\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

  body: "Hi Harmock,\r\n\r\nI second Jasonc: Just seat down and draw something and
    it will get you thinking. I too worked for many other people that would change
    and contract and stretch and flip my designs, and they all got changed by the
    unexkilled supervisor or the client. Sometimes I have a impression that graphic
    design is the big BULL of all arts; nonetheless you, \"we\" chosen it to be our
    craft. Don't give up, just keep on going, just try to do something genuine. I
    do look at other peoples designs sometimes when I need a idea, and I realized
    that when you do look at others designs, the best is look back to the 'old guys'.\r\n\r\nI
    suppose you got laid off because the biggest BULL of all times is just upon us:
    I too god laid off, but this time around I chose to go back to letterpress, cause
    it reminds me the kid fun of getting the little blocks together to produce a mould.\r\n\r\nI
    am sure you will get your stuff together and move on: Have you considered going
    'solo'?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    the downturn in the economy is the reason for the \"Reduction in Force\" that
    the design firm had to do. I was assured that it was not my print production work
    that was the reason, but the lack of clients and inability to continue paying
    me.\r\n\r\nI will go back and look at some of the \"old guys\" and see if they
    give me inspiration.\r\n\r\nI don't have a client base to be able to go solo and
    I have no idea how I would begin to market to start getting clients. I think I
    know enough good printers in the area who know my quality production work and
    would be happy to work with me if I had clients, but this is an area I'm not sure
    I'm ready to explore."

  body: "You're giving yourself a pretty hard time about your own stationery/identity.
    \r\n\r\nAs a project, this is probably the hardest one to undertake, even when
    you're totally killing briefs day to day. Designing stuff for yourself is always
    a nightmare, the client is really fussy, never 100% happy, and will probably decide
    they hate it once it's back from the printers.\r\n\r\nSeriously though - i would
    write yourself a brief, a really structured one, and tackle the project as if
    it were for a client. Set out key objectives, define the target audience, set
    a budget etc. then use this brief as a benchmark to judge your designs against,
    as opposed to just asking yourself wether you think they're good or not.\r\n\r\nA
    great book for someone in your position is 'How To Be A Graphic Designer Without
    Losing Your Soul' by Adrian Shaughnessy. (amazon will sell it) - don't be put
    off by the title, it really is an inspirational read (as well as a beautifully
    designed book)\r\n\r\nGood luck \r\n\r\nJ\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Iam confused. \r\n\r\n\r\nYour trying to create an identity system for your
    portfolio?\r\n\r\nIs this necessary even. Keep it simple.  Pick a typeface you
    used a lot in the past three years and show how you mastered it. Apply this to
    your resume and portfolio. Dont try to come up w/ a whole new identity for your
    interviewer. That could take months and may not be your best work.\r\n\r\nSince
    you were working for the last three years you should have enough work and experience
    to easily get a job. If you were  doing ad resizes and stuff like that just include
    them in your portfolio talk about how you were able to fit the copy and imagery
    in. This is important thing to learn and important for future employers to see.
    Your usually going to be interviewed by the art director so he/she isnt going
    to expect you to be creating everything for them. Thats what they are for and
    your going to make your way up just pay your dues. Your developing your decision
    making skills. Its like a game of tetris. You know!\r\n\r\nDont be so down on
    yourself. It will only make design harder. Believe in yourself. We all doubt our
    skills, its why people get so insecure and competitive in this field.\r\n\r\nYou
    can DO IT!"

    block. I\u2019m trying the working away from the computer idea now.</em>\r\n\r\nIdeas
    are cool, they're such a groove aren't they? I believe ideas, and the pursuit
    there of, define the individual and underpin a democracy. They're something which
    comes up from within. They're born through inspiration. And to be inspired is
    a powerful thang.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm on the other side of the coin darmock.
    My life is utterly bombarded by ideas. I can't seem to keep up, I've come to a
    point where I just jot them down, number them, and move on to the next one. It
    feels like I'm being pushed - driven by the idea.\r\nMost anything can trigger
    'inspiration', and if you want to push yourself, and force inspiration, then try
    to think of a subject matter and what form that that subject matter could take.
    And that form could be anything from elegant to crude - think in terms of texture
    and relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm beginning to ramble...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Design is not just about about the end product.\r\nTaking many of the biggest
    names be they contemporary or historical most of them were not technical perfectionists
    or masters of the art.\r\n\r\nWhat defines good work is beyond the appealing side
    of the eye candy which may be laid out before us. \r\n\r\nThis could all be seen
    as a bit too much of a brainiac approach and the debate theory versus practice
    is neverending in itself; but one must do research before going to the drawing
    board.\r\n\r\nNot to give you a lesson in the basics of creative design but it's
    primordial to generate ideas before you can lay them out. Some go by it by keyword
    searching, looking at other peoples work, doodling etc.\r\nThere are so many ways,
    some are good for x and others for y. You need to find yours.\r\nPersonally I
    do a lot of background research when working on projects, and most of my \"key\"
    ideas come when I'm not in the process ( often in the evening or middle of the
    night ... sometimes when out shopping etc) ... so writing material is with me
    at all times.\r\n\r\nSorry if I am off track in my comment."

    up with a grid that's worth drawing a wireframe on top of it. Then i take it from
    there. It's a nice exercise that gets me going whenever i am \"blocked\". \r\nMaybe
    i am getting too close to the creativity vs. technique discussion here, but whenever
