  a college letterpress shop. The J looks quite narrow and the Q tail is also unusual.
  I looked through Jaspert, et al, and found nothing to match it, and so far I haven't
  spotted it in McGrew's book either.\r\nI'm still hunting, but I thought maybe someone
  here would recognize it.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Thanks for your help,\r\n\r\n- Mike"
