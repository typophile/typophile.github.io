  attachment picture. They are from Vogue Paris magazine, which has gorgeous typography

  Thank you very much! '

  body: "#1 is available as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/main-strike/\">Main
    Strike</a> (a somewhat simplified revival). A type book from 1971 calls this face
    Bracelet.\r\n\r\n#2 looks like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.125135.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=DAVID+SIMS&sampleSize=48\">Caslon</a>
    to me, but it's not exactly a cut that I know.\r\n\r\n#3 also looks like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=SG.101933.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=au+tamis+des&sampleSize=48\">Caslon</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd
    hey, #4 also looks like an old cut of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.115367.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=photographe+unique&sampleSize=48\">Caslon
    italic</a>."
