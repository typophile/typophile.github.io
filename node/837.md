  they are ripoff clones&#41;. <BR> <BR>This is a set of 8 fonts with light through
  bold with italics. My image uses the regular weight with a sampling of it&#39;s
  italic at the bottom. MyFonts&#39; WhatTheFont was no help. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/13810.gif"

  body: I&#39;m pretty sure that not all the Brendel&#39;s are clones. This <BR>may
    be a Brendel / Quick Brown Fox / Softmaker / Type &amp;  <BR>Workshop / B&amp;P
    Graphics original.

  body: This font is WTC Favrile. It was in one of the Expresiv collections as &#34;Fascinate&#34;.
    It was designed by Tom Carnase in 1985 for the World Typeface Center. The book
    I have showing it says Autologic and Linotype also sold it, but this was a book
    published 13 years ago &#40;Modern Encyclopedia of Typefaces 1960 - 1990, by Lawrence
    Wallis.&#41;

  body: Mike,  thanks for those links. I have never seen that site before, and that
    is a great place to see some samples in a nice clear format. Too bad the samples
    focus on lowercase and not uppercase very much &#40;and that there are relatively
    few selections&#41;, but I understand the amount of work involved, believe me.
    I&#39;ve bookmarked the site.
