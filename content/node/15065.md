  typeface for the redesign of a Metropolitan Owners Club magazine here in the UK.\r\n\r\nI'm
  aware that i can get this typeface snail-mailed to me from http://www.torq-o.com/HTML/Airflyte.htm...
  however I need it v.soon.\r\n\r\nAnyone can help with a reseller that can sell direct
  (online/download)?... or with a copy to 'borrow' until my disc arrives in the post
  (ridiculous! but cute) :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanx in advance\r\nVV\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    You could get these right away. The quality of Airflyte seems suspect (too much
    uneven color, imo)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flashfonts.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flashfonts.com/flashsite/order.html"
