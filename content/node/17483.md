  conclusions. I need to license a text typeface for a company that facilitates tax
  pooling transactions. As the transactions will be web based, I feel that it needs
  to be clean, serious and contemporary but not too bland and lifeless. I am thinking
  sans, but will not rule out a serif. The typeface will be used for printed collateral
  and possibly a little bit for screen, but not at tiny resolutions. Any suggestions
  will be gratefully received!\r\n\r\nKris."

    be used for printed collateral, little bit on screen.\r\n\r\nHelp."

    branding a company that facilitates tax-pooling. They will have a web-site that
    their clients will use for tax-pooling transactions. The company needs afformentioned
    web-site and print collateral branded. We need a typeface to use for the printed
    collateral, and possibly the web-site. \r\n\r\nHope that clarifies the situation!"

    Zwo is too, I hate Daxline, Freight Micro is great but not the sans, Amplitude
    hasn't any italics, Klavika is slightly too mechanical, Monitor is too square,
    Vista too organic and Whitney too generic. \r\n\r\nThey are all great suggestions,
    however. Strada is really interesting, however. It may be slightly too organic
    for this, but it has shot to the top of my \"must get\" list never-the-less! \r\n\r\nAny
    others? "
