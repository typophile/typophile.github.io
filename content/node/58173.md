  what is the font that bbc  home (http://www.bbc.co.uk/) uses for article headings
  and the contents.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help. Unfortunatrly, whatthefont wasn't
  useful at all. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMagda"

    my Photoshop generates :/ Probably changed style. I like it, I will try more."

    renders text differently than Web application. It smoothes text to make it look
    crisp, and not ragged and pixelised like screen fonts. You can always turn off
    smoothing in the \"Character\" window in Photoshop, but I don't suggest you do
    so."

  body: "Obviously you are not very familiar with Web typography. BBC's website uses
    standard Web-safe type, which are usually Verdana or Arial for PC-users or Helvetica
    for Mac users. In this case the headlines and body text seem both to be set in
    Verdana.\r\n\r\nFor further reference, most text in websites is set in either
    Times New Roman (or Times on Mac machines), Arial (Helvetica on Mac), Verdana,
    Geneva, etc... though nowadays most PC-safe fonts are readily available for Mac
    as well. This is to ensure that the viewing experience will be the same whatever
    the user's configuration."
