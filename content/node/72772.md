  am pretty sure someone coined the phrase, \"words we see\" but can not find the
  citation or author. Any and all such quotes about what is typography would be appreciated.
  And, I will credit both the original author and who has helped me by posting it!"

  body: "Great,\r\n\r\nThank you both.\r\n\r\nHere's one from a book, I think it is
    pretty obscure, maybe not:\r\n\r\n\"P's and Q's, A Book on the Art of Letter Arrangement\"
    by Sallie B. Tannahill, (Garden City, New York, Doubleday, Doran & Company, Inc.,
    1944) in the introduction:\r\n\r\n\"Well-selected letters, drawn with force and
    quality, arranged in good proportion, tone, and colour, and grouped in a sign,
    a poster, a card, or a letterhead, may be as fine and as complete a design as
    is a costume, a textile, a plate, a chair, or a building. The symbols of out alphabet
    are fixed; an A must always be an A, a P can never be a Q, but the power to use
    these letters, to vary them, and to arrange them is unlimited. The problem of
    the designer is to know how to do this in a fine way.\""
