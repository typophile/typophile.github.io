    data to show chars with this font on UI or create a font object on Java under

    people on this forum who will be able to help you. People here have more experience
    in developing fonts, and not so much in developing apps that use them. '

  body: Yeah this looks like it would better asked on a Java forum. I think a bit
    of background is that Java apps due to their platform sandboxed nature can't access
    installed system fonts at all.
