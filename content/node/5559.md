  <BR> <BR>This unbracketed slab serif font reminded me of old gambling signage, hence
  the name. <BR> <BR>This will probably be the bold weight, as it is a bit heavy for
  normal text. I hope to produce a book weight and black weight sometime as well.
  <BR> <BR>Comments and critique welcome. <BR> <BR>David Thometz

    how you&#39;ve made it from pieces of &#34;f&#34; &#40;well, long &#34;s&#34;&#41;
    and &#34;s,&#34; but this might be an overly-literal way of approaching the character.
    <BR> <BR>The numerals are nice, with the exception that the eight looks a little
    bottom-heavy &#40;actually, top-light, or &#34;pinheaded&#34;&#41;. Also, although
    this is by no means an objective judgement, the &#34;sideways,&#34; Stempel-Garamond-esque
    zero was something I could never get used to. In the context of &#34;rough&#34;
    signage types, though, it might work. <BR> <BR>Finally: great asterisk! '
