    paid big bucks advised that, when converting from RGB to CMYK, one convert to
    LAB color first, then to CMYK. The color shifts that inevitably occur SHOULD be
    greatly reduced as a result. Or so GATF says..."

  body: 'Someone a little more knowledgeable about the format can probably correct
    me but, from what I understand, the LAB format was developed precisely to be an
    intermediary between the reflective (CMYK) and transmitted (RGB) color models.
    We have a Heidelberg Quickstep scanner at work (a poky, but very precise $25K
    number) that by default scans in LAB, evidently precisely for this reason: the
    finished product can be converted to either RGB or CMYK, and there won''t be any
    noticeable color shift. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that, if LAB
    can go either way with minimal damage done, the best path from RGB to CMYK is
    through LAB. Or so GATF says...but it seems to work for me.'

  body: "There is truth in that, however inevitably there will be some colors which
    are achievable in CMYK & not RGB & some in RGB that cannon be reproduced in CMYK.
    This is true no matter what process is used. These process are there to help steer
    away from problem color values - at least in part. \r\n\r\nWhen you consider pantone
    or other inks alone or combined into CMYK the range of possible overlaps is bigger
    in both directions but that is getting *much* fancier. It is also true that many
    RGB colors can still not be made in Pantone or any ink & that many Pantone ink
    colors cannot be made in RGB."

    reproduced in CMYK, particularly oranges and greens, which is why the Hexachrome
    system was developed, although I haven't seen it used/mentioned too much lately.

    non-cmyk colors will look dull in CMYK. Your biggest problem is lack of contrast,
    as those colors end up mid-tone in CMYK. So what looks like a nice electric green
    on a darker red background will come out with similar tones.\r\n\r\nSo either
    nip the problem in the bud and don't use those RGB-only colors in the first place
    for twin-media projects (familiarize yourself with those colors), or else add
    some trickery in the print job -- dropshadows and outlines -- for problematic
    juxtapositions."

    custom curves to alter a copy of the original RGB to get better conversion to
    CMYK.\r\n\r\nYou might see a super saturated RGB red go to a very dull CMYK red.
    If you bring that RGB red a little closer to a CMYK red in the RGB mode you can
    get a much better conversion.\r\n\r\nYou do need a calibrated system to attempt
    this sort of thing."

  body: "Marnie's right: Photoshop invisibly transforms the RGB file to L*a*b before
    reconverting it to CMYK, so converting to L*a*b yourself is redundant. The transform
    is also high-bit (I forget, but at least 16bpp. It might be 18 or 20).\r\n\r\nSo
    when you convert RGB->CMYK or do a profile->profile conversion, it goes:\r\n\r\nRGB
    (8 or 16 bit) -> L*a*b (high-bit) -> CMYK (8 or 16 bit).\r\n\r\nL*a*b, being a
    device-independent space, is effectively the middleman for any type of colour
    transform.\r\n\r\nW/r/t to retaining out-of-gamut colours, there are various approaches.
    First of all there are the four built-in conversion methods (rendering intents):\r\n\r\n-
    Relative colorimetric moves out-of-gamut colours into the new gamut and leaves
    in-gamut colours alone. It works well for most transforms and is my default setting.
    RelCol, unlike AbsCol, also remaps the white and black points of the old gamut
    to the new one.\r\n\r\n- Perceptual compresses the entire colour gamut in order
    to pull in o-o-g colours, so there may be some overall loss of saturation. It
    works well for photographic-type images with an overall mid-grey colour average
    (ie lots of different colours). It also remaps white and black points. Try it
    if RelCol gives a poor result.\r\n\r\n- Absolute Colorimetric clips o-o-g colours
    and represents old colour numbers from the viewpoint of the new gamut. Doesn't
    remap white/black points. It's used for soft-proofing on screen, for example.
    Never to be used for straightforward RGB->CMYK conversions.\r\n\r\n- Saturation
    retains saturation information at the expense of hue and luminosity. Good for
    big areas of pure colour -- ie not photo-type images, but block-colour designs
    etc.\r\n\r\nThe bulldozer approach is to switch on Photoshop's gamut warning and
    work with the Hue/Saturation sliders until you can manually bring all colours
    within gamut. I've never managed to get great results doing this -- the built-in
    colour engine is a lot smarter than me :).\r\n\r\nOne other approach is to change
    your CMYK working space. There are various different flavours of SWOP and ISO
    working spaces that have slightly different colour gamuts and better or worse
    transforms. The Adobe SWOP v2 space is good, but I've always got the best results
    with the old Kodak SWOP Press profile and build all my custom profiles around
    that.\r\n\r\nThe last approach is to convert and then, post-conversion, work with
    the CMYK file to bring out the best possible balance of saturation and detail.
    This is what I generally end up doing if I have a problematic image to convert.\r\n\r\nIn
    the old days this wasn't a problem because you sent your trannies to a good drum
    scanner op and he sent you back ready-separated CMYK files. You never even saw
    the RGB images, so didn't latch on to the wider gamuts available in RGB spaces.
    These days a good 70% of images sent to me are originated digitally and arrive
    as RGB (often untagged -- ie, with no information about the colour space they're
    originated in).\r\n\r\nYou can read a lot more about this stuff at the Yahoo <a
    href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/colortheory/\" target=\"_blank\">Colour Theory
    group</a>. Or Google 'Dan Margulis makeready' for some fascinating colour-oriented
    articles.\r\n\r\nR\r\n\r\n"

      for calculations. \r\n\r\nRGB and CMYK can both span the same spectrum: the
      differenent monitor and printer gamut is due to the phosphors and inks used,
      which span different subsets of the visible spectrum, and thus a conversation
      is needed. \r\n\r\nL*a*b* is used as a middleman because it's perceptually uniform:
      that is, linear distances between colors agree with the visual perception of
      that distance (unlike in the XYZ/RGB color-spaces, e.g.), and thus simplify
      the math involved in the conversation, since when in L*a*b* we can match near
      colors using a linear metric."

  body: Profiles are critically important. You really don't stand a chance of getting
    predictable output without matching your proofer to actual printed press sheets,
    which is simple if you're a printer, but pretty tought if you're an independent
    designer. Again, for what it's worth and please feel free to correct me, those
    who know better, but...the GATF technician set up a profile for us with SWOP 20%
    dot gain and heavy GCR (gray component removal -- makes pure black do the heavy
    lifting in the shadow areas), and it really snapped up our printing.
