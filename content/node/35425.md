  help expediate my search is appreciated. I'm working on a logo that ends with \"y\"
  and starts with \"c\" and I would like to somewhat mimic the curve of the \"c\"
  with the curve of the \"y\" at the end\r\n\r\nExample of the y:\r\nhttp://www.imgdumb.com/images/536124Myriad-y.gif\r\n\r\n\r\n "
