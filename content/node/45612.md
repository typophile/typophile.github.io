  of our recent releases has the same name as a previous release from said designer
  / foundry. They are asking me to change the name of our release to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nI'm
  not opposed to changing the name by any means and feel somewhat neutral towards
  this conflict at this point.\r\n\r\nIt seems that conflicts would happen somewhat
  frequently and I know that in other industries there are product naming overlaps
  as well.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any experience with this issue, I imagine some
  people have ran into this issue and have dealt with a variety of situations that
  are similar.\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback."

  body: David, well the font(s) in question are titled 'Verse', completely different
    fonts with the same name. Completely different foundries and styles. If you contact
    me I'll forward you the links but I don't want to post and reveal who I was contacted
    by just for reasons. Thanks for your response.

  body: "Well, many foundries trademark their typeface names to try to avoid this
    problem. Of course you need to do a trademark search, and if you're sane also
    an Internet search for just the name plus the word \"font\" to see if you find
    anything.\r\n\r\nTypical for Adobe typefaces is that the name we end up using
    is our second or third choice. But Brioso was Robert's fifth choice name for that
    typeface! I forget the whole list, but \"Roma\" was the working name for a long
    time. In a similar vein, Arno was once \"Sphere\" and Hypatia Sans was originally
    \"Geo\" and then \"Geode.\"\r\n\r\nAdobe does protect its trademarks, and if we
    notice a font using the same name afterwards, we'll politely ask them to change
    it.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback. What happens when all the good names are used up?
    \r\n\r\nI wonder how it works in the case of Designers Shock where all of their
    fonts were named with 'DS' preceding the name. Is it still a conflict if, for
    arguments sake, Designers Shock (do they still exist?) created a font and titled
    it 'DS Garamond'?\r\n\r\nAnd oh yeah Dav your right, his font is named VerseSans
    and VerseSerif. I just finished a stencil version of Verse named Verse ST which
    hasn't been released yet except for the regular weight which is a free download
    for our Facebook group members.\r\n\r\nBy the way that last sentence way above
    is missing 'privacy', for privacy reasons\u2026 I wish the edit option was always
    available on comments."

    first serve'. Be the first to use it > 'own' at least some rights to it. <em>(Who's
    late to the 'game' may have to use either more original names \u2014 yes, please;
    or have to live with using 2nd hand, 'seen/read/used before', names.)</em>\r\n\r\nAnd
    I am confident that it should be in the interest of every single type designer
    to find unique and at the same time at least quite memorable names for his/her
    typefaces. <em>(So, Actually, I think it's not only a problem of legally 'sharing'
    a name, but of getting your very own 'creations' confused with someone elses work.)</em>\r\n\r\nStaying
    on the subject, DS may have another problem, if they are still 'in business' for
    artsy, fartsy, trendy display type: The abbreviation 'DS' is used by 'Designers
    Shock' (DS) as well as 'Dino dos Santos' (DS Type). ;)\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: "This all comes under the heading of Trademark. \"Garamond\" has become a
    generic description for a whole class of types and is no longer unique enough
    to be trademarked. So no one foundry can claim a right to it and protect against
    others using it. Foundries that wish to use the Garamond label come up with adjuncts
    in order to A) distinguish their Garamond from others, and B) make it trademarkable.
    \"Adobe Garamond\" can be trademarked. \"Garamond\" cannot.\r\n\r\nThe naming
    challenge faced by type designers and foundries is not significantly different
    from the same challenge in other commercial sectors -- How to come up with something
    distinctive, appealing, memorable, descriptive or evocative, unique, trademarkable,
    etc. Naming products and brands is a business unto itself.\r\n\r\nThere is a whole
    hierarchy of characteristics that make a name more or less trademarkable (e.g.,
    common descriptive terms are not generally trademarkable; completely invented
    words are highly trademarkable). You might familiarize yourself with some of the
    basics of trademark law by seeking out a good legal reference on the subject.
    Nolo Press publishes a good one. (You could check your local library.) They also
    provide some online FAQs at www.nolopress.com."

    of the word \"Liberty\" by the trademark office. It is up to the trademark holder
    to protect the trademark. We recently asked a font reseller to remove a font family
    due to its name conflicting with one of our trademarks.\r\n\r\nJamesM"
