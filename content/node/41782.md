body: "Somewhere in the blogosphere a month or two ago I saw a sans serif, clean font
  where the lines terminated with an end that was rounded, but there were still corners
  where the curve met the lines.  (see the attached photo)\r\n\r\nI've been scouring
  google reader and a few blogs i frequent but cannot find it.  This is a shot in
  the dark, but your help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nPS - Apologies if my terminology
  is incorrect.  I welcome your corrections."
