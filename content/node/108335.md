  body: "I don't know if this monogram is produced by a digital font. Date and source
    of image would help.\r\nFor a digital font that can produce monograms with a similar
    formal swirl effect I suggest Antoinette Monogrammes:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/antoinette-monogrammes/\r\nIf
    you can do a little additional work to make monograms here are some vertical swirl
    \ scripts that could produce a nice result:\r\nSweet Upright Script:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/upright-script/\r\nValentine:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/valentine/\r\nStradivarius:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/stradivarius/\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "The font used was Harold Lohner's <a href='http://www.fontbros.com/families/vine-monograms/?code=harold'
    target='_blank'>Vine Monograms</a>. I thought that last letter was a 'C', but
    it's not - it's an 'L'. Read the PDF manual and then use the Testdrive.\r\n\r\nI
    can't imagine having made such a set of 6 fonts as all combinations of letters
    must work well together and each font contains characters for three different
    styles of frame."
