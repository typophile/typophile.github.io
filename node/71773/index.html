  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>At the urging of my dear friend and colleague Israel Seldowitz, I wish to share with the Typophile Hebrew group some news about Mahzor Lev Shalem, the new High Holidays Mahzor I designed and produced for the Rabbinical Assembly. It&rsquo;s a work of 944 pages, measuring 6.5&quot; (16.5cm) x 9.1875&quot; (28.34cm). The Hebrew type, inspired by Henri Friedlaender&rsquo;s Hadassah, was made by me and Israel.</p>

<p>The first printing of 130,000 sold out before all the books were off the bindery line. A second printing of another 50,000 copies, which contains a number of small corrections, is now underway.</p>
<p>All the best,

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow. With such complexity and multiple demands you are able to achieve a clean and easy-to-grasp page. Deeply impressive work. You did the Mishkan T&rsquo;filah for the Reform movement also?</p>
<p>The I find the top terminal on the lamed a little distracting, but I need to see it all in print, which I haven&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>I would be interested in your take on bilingual text with Hebrew on the left (as in the Koren siddur) vs on the right, as you have here. What guided your decisions on this?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you, William. The decision to place the Hebrew on the left was made largely out of Conservative tradition. At one point, I tried it the other way, but given that the annotations surrounding the Hebrew text were often extensive, the right-hand position was clearly better. What one might do in the abstract is often quite different from managing a real-life situation&ndash;especially so with glossed texts that are laid out Talmudically. Though Hebrew has pride of place, with a heavier weight than any of the Latins, it is a book dominated by the Latin alphabet. It is, after all, an American book made for liberal-leaning congregations.</p>
<p>A far more controversial decision was the placement of the transliterated passages on the left, with the English, rather than near the Hebrew passages in question. The prevailing thought there (I was in the outvoted minority) was to allow those who wished to avail themselves of a purely Hebrew prayer experience the freedom to do so without interruption. Whether or not you think that makes sense, placing the transliterations on the right, with the Hebrew, would have cut down on the space for the annotations, which are a hallmark of Conservative intellectual life. There is a great deal going on in this book, and to keep it clear and easy to follow at all times requires decisions that one might well reconsider for more simple publications.</p>
<p>I did NOT work on Mishkan T&rsquo;filah, but I am working with the CCAR, the Reform rabbinical organization, on a prayerbook for mourners at home and, soon, their new Mahzor. Israel Seldowitz and I are well into a new typeface for it, this one based on Ismar David&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Funny you mention the lamed. II find it quite a bit less distracting than Friedlaender&rsquo;s design, with its little top flag, but it&rsquo;s good to know your opinion. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll change it in some future version.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, I can see that the all the commentary put strong constraints on what you could do. I don&rsquo;t have a strong feeling that one way of mirroring is better than the other—probably it depends on other factors.</p>
<p>I see you have a special character for the kamatz katan, but no special character for the schva na—which your friend Israel has discussed endlessly here :)  Probably that was a decision of the editors, right?</p>
<p>I also like the design of Mishkan T&rsquo;filah, as it was such an improvement over Gates of Prayer. But this is still better. I love your sensitive use of the red, which really has helped you pull off the impossible of making all this into a coherent, readable structure, which is beautiful to boot.</p>
<p>One more question, a printing question. The bright red in the PDF is a traditional printing color, but I see most second color reds now are almost always deeper, like a brick red of some sort. I thought that this was because the bright red would be too transparent and weak in offset printing, as opposed to the old classic letter press.</p>
<p>Does the published version use the same red? Any advice on choosing reds? I am seeing JPS tomorrow about my new guide to Pirke Avot, which uses a red also, so any insight is most welcome!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for all the kind words. The kamatz katan had been a feature of Conservative siddurim for some time (often as a patach with a dot underneath&ndash;as it appears in the Aleppo and Leningrad Codices), but the sh&rsquo;va na and sh&rsquo;va nach had never made the cut. One thing I advocated for (at Israel&rsquo;s urging) that made it in was the patach g&rsquo;nuvah, the patach at the right side of the letter. I suspect some people will think it&rsquo;s a mistake, until they see it recur a number of times.</p>
<p>The red in the file is PMS 1805, but the red we printed was a special mix, made to match the endleaf color, Ecological Fibers' Crimson in the Rainbow series. It worked well in the first printing, though in the second, now just off press, I asked that they stiffen it a bit. The paper, which is quite nice at 28# (42gsm) weight, has good holdout and opacity, so it can take a solid hit.</p>
<p>Good luck with the Pirkei Avot!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Scott!</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;re posting here, I&rsquo;m looking a little closer than when I first saw the AIGA article. The lamed doesn&rsquo;t bother me in the slightest, but I&rsquo;m probably just very used to seeing it so many different ways. I think adding the red was a bold decision which pays off, from a design perspective. I&rsquo;m surprised that the RA didn&rsquo;t balk at the extra color!</p>
<p>On page 210 compared to 211, I&rsquo;m wondering why you chose to make the right annotation columns such different widths?</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>Tevi</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To Tevi: The commentary on page 210 begins with a continuation of the commentary on 209, which had to be set in a slightly narrower column to accommodate the Hebrew, so I decided to keep it narrow on 210, returning to full width on on 211. It was going to create a dissonance one way or the other, so I chose to keep it consistent with something. These are lose-lose situations in which one can only try to rationalize the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>To David Hamuel: Yes, like those&ndash;precisely!! 
About the kamatz in the Leningrad: What I meant to say was that, in some of its earlier publications, the Rabbinical Assembly used a patach with a dot underneath to denote the kamatz katan and the standard &ldquo;T&rdquo; form for the normal kamatz. The patach-underdot was the form of the NORMAL kamatz in the Leningrad and Aleppo. This is not a bubbe-meyse; my evidence for the Leningrad is the full facsimile published by Eerdmans/Brill, a copy of which I own. The Aleppo can be seen online: <a href="http://www.aleppocodex.org/">http://www.aleppocodex.org/</a> &ndash;look and see for yourself. There are places in both codices where the two elements run together, and others that appear to be more of a vertical line than a dot (runny ink), but it&rsquo;s perfectly clear to see that this two-part form of the kamatz was the manner of the time, at least with this scribe. I can&rsquo;t claim any special khokhma on the subject beyond my observations, which, at the end of the day, is all that matters to me.</p>
<p>Update on the new David font: I started all over again to make something new. It retains a four or five things from David that will be recognizable, but overall it&rsquo;s moved to an all new place. The first David I made with Israel will be used in the home mourner&rsquo;s siddur, but probably never again. The weights of the new font (I&rsquo;m making three) bear no relation at all to Ismar&rsquo;s eponymous font. I think I may call it Sh&rsquo;lomo&ndash;Son of David. It&rsquo;s farther from David than the Milon font is from Hadassah. I may post it when it&rsquo;s ready, though I am not a blogger by habit.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Scott</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As I mentioned in my posting of 28 July, what began as a new version of Ismar David&rsquo;s ubiquitous font morphed into something new, a font I&rsquo;m calling Shlomo. It contains some quotations from David, but is generally simpler in form. Though the attached images include a very large size, keep in mind that it&rsquo;s intended for text. I&rsquo;m developing it for the Reform religious community, in which fluent Hebrew readers are in the minority. There will be a bold weight beside the regular and medium (for small text) shown here, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten to it yet. The encoding of the nikkud (there will be taamim, too) hasn&rsquo;t begun, so what&rsquo;s here has been &ldquo;hand composed,&rdquo; awaiting my last adjustments to the glyphs and their sidebearings. There&rsquo;s no kerning table yet, either; these samples driven completely by the sidebearings, which, for Hebrew with diacriticals, have to be considered very carefully.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to hear your thoughts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here&rsquo;s how the font has progressed. The stems have been regularized and many of of the characters have been revised, some quite significantly. There&rsquo;s much work to be done, finishing the spacing work and encoding the positions of all the diacriticals, but I can&rsquo;t imagine that the glyphs will change greatly. After about 25 passes, I think this is it. A bold and light will be added, and it&rsquo;s likely that I&rsquo;ll add a titling version, incorporating some of the more decorative details that were abandoned after the first version. My goal has been clarity and simplicity, an easy-reading type that&rsquo;s well-suited to less advanced readers. Beside the nikkud, there will be a full battery of taamim.</p>
<p>A number of colleagues offered very helpful critiques: Lance Hidy, Misha Beletsky, Ed Feld, Howard Gralla, David Sarna, David Stein, and, of course, Israel Seldowitz, my partner in crime. I thank all of them!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just got back from vacation, and am catching up. I&rsquo;ve never designed a Hebrew font, so the following may just my inexperience speaking. But since you asked&hellip;</p>
<p>I like a lot the way the terminals are handled. To my eyes they are nicer than those of David, which is a fine font, but somehow looks a bit clunky and dated to me. I particularly like the lamed in Shlomo.</p>
<p>However, to me there are a number of problems with the characters. One problem is that I think the rhythm is disturbed by the extra width of the chet and tav compared to the hey. I have just opened some of the most popular Hebrew fonts and compared them to your current version of Shlomo: Narkis Tam, Narkism, Frank-Reuhl, Hadasa, and David. Many have the chet <em>slightly</em> wider than the hey, which makes sense in equalizing the white space within the two characters, as the hey has the white gap on the left that the chet doesn&rsquo;t. But visually yours seems to go too far to me in being too wide. Also the tav isn&rsquo;t normally quite as wide as chet internally, as it has that squiggly leg on the left, which visually opens it up inside a bit.</p>
<p>I would say that the mem sofit is a bit too wide also compared to the mem, though there it&rsquo;s easier to get away with, as it comes at the end of words and you don&rsquo;t get so much of a problematic &ldquo;accordion&rdquo; effect, which to me happens with the chet and tav. Some greater width of the mem sofit is justified by the white gap in the regular mem, but again not quite that much. David has a pretty wide mem sofit also, but I think it goes a bit too far also. In some of the others the mem sofit is even narrower than the mem.</p>
<p>To me there is something disturbing and not good looking about the top of the regular mem. In all of those other fonts, the left side of the arch in the mem thins going into the stem. Yours doesn&rsquo;t and that&rsquo;s part of the problem. The curve also to me looks too symmetrical and weak, but to tell you the truth I&rsquo;m not that crazy about David&rsquo;s mem either, which I can see influenced you here&ndash;though David does have thinning where the stem joins.</p>
<p>The samech also looks to me uncomfortably symmetrical. In all of those other fonts, including David, the left stroke is less curved than the right, and to me looks more &ldquo;right&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Finally, to me the shin should have less white space to the left of the middle stroke, and more to the right. This is true in all of the fonts I mentioned. Especially relevant is Narkis Tam, as you have adopted the characteristic Narkis shape with the smoothly rounded bottom of the shin. He joins the middle branch a lot higher on the left, which makes the counter on the left smaller than on the right.</p>
<p>(We have, alas, just lost Tzvi Narkis, designer of Narkis Tam and Narkisim and other great fonts.)</p>
<p>A lot of this critique on issues of shape relate to the sense of motion to the left in Hebrew. The nature of the conventional asymmetries in these characters contribute to that motion to the left. (I would also increase the asymmetry of the aleph for that reason, but that is just personal preferance; I wouldn&rsquo;t say that the current shape is a problem.) The other thing is about visually even color and rhythm, which I am admittedly a fanatic about, as I think that this contributes to readability.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>William, thanks for your comments. I found many of them quite helpful. Here are the latest versions, which now include a semi-light and a bold. You&rsquo;ll note that several characters have been redesigned, others changed in various small ways. I design type for text, so I&rsquo;m loath to show large letters as I did here. As such, I&rsquo;m far more concerned with sidebearings and fit than I am with the smallest details of character design. In Hebrew, especially when nikkud and taamim will be deployed, letter fit is a matter of life and death. You don&rsquo;t have the same options of using kerning tables to fix things; it all has to happen in the sidebearings. That can be quite challenging, especially when narrow letters have to accommodate an elaborate apparatus of diacriticals.</p>
<p>The JPEG renderings of the text sizes looks horrible here and give a poor impression of the stroke details and weights. I think I won&rsquo;t post pictures of type again. If anyone is interested in seeing the fonts, email me and I&rsquo;ll send a PDF that can be printed.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I wish everyone Shanah Tovah. May you all be inscribed in the best books.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Scott, I&rsquo;m glad it was helpful. I do think the new version is quite improved. You write &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have the same options of using kerning tables to fix things; it all has to happen in the sidebearings.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s correct. I just opened Hadasa MFO (Mastertype Open Type) in Font Lab and it contains an open type kerning table. Also note that if you are having problems with the side bearings it could be that the width or design of the glyph needs modification, as this affects how the sidebearings work.</p>
<p>Shana Tova to you as well, a joyful and productive year!</p>

<p>I checked my code, indeed this is how I actually do it, but since I wanted to use kerning classes, I just make kerning classes as if it were a LTR kerning, then a script I wrote converts the classes to kerning pairs with proper adjustment prior to font generation. It took me a while to get the kerning right, I tested so many approaches and, apparently, I&rsquo;m still confused which one worked for me (so many RTL kerning bugs in applications, too).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you, all. I believe I may have misstated my case. I do deploy kerning pairs in this font and in other Hebrew fonts I&rsquo;ve made. What I meant to say, or at least emphasize, was that in Hebrew with diacriticals, kerning pairs have limited usefulness, as the context of intervening nikkud and taamim have to be taken into account, especially so with narrow glyphs, such as yod and vav. That being the case, I strive to be utterly judicious and disciplined setting the sidebearings to work in most every circumstance. This is what I learned to do many years ago casting metal type. Without that decade of experience working in metal, I don&rsquo;t know that I would really understand the discipline of typefitting. I should add, too, that were this font intended only for Modern Hebrew, I would have fit it somewhat differently, likely a bit tighter.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m here, may I ask your opinion of the tsadi and tsadi sofit? Are they beyond the pale? Do you think the aleph should have the same sort of upper member?</p>

The right arm of the tzadi doesn&rsquo;t bother me, but if you haven&rsquo;t already I would ask Israelis who are used to reading a lot of different Hebrew fonts. You might try rotating the arm a bit counter-clockwise, to open the &ldquo;v&rdquo; more, to see whether that hurts or helps, if you haven&rsquo;t already. I think the bottom right of the tzadi is too heavy compared to the other letters, The aleph can work either way, so its just what you like, and making it work&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, I believe there is some way to define RTL kerning correctly in AFDKO syntax as used in FontLab etc.. I only use VOLT for OTL work so don&rsquo;t know for sure how it works in AFKDO syntax, but it might be as simple as including that &lsquo;RightToLeft&rsquo; statement in the code. It was Eric Muller at Adobe who first alerted me to the problem of applying GPOS pair adjustment values to the 2nd glyph, so I&rsquo;m certain that they made AFDKO in a way that would compile kerning for RTL scripts with the appropriate dx and width adjustments.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you all, for your helpful comments. I&rsquo;ve made a considerable number of changes to Shlomo since I last posted&ndash;starting with the alef. As with all text types that aspire to usefulness, I&rsquo;m trying to make it disappear, so most of the eccentricities have been jettisoned. David did a good job of embarrassing me out of the tsadi sofit (and with it, the tsadi). Did I go too far? Maybe one more pass and I&rsquo;ll call it finished.</p>
<p>Michael, your question about the wide final forms is a good one. As you know, one cannot break words in Hebrew, so the wide final letters were adopted for justification. Some surviving early fonts have final letters of two widths. Over the past century, they fell out of favor, as mechanical typesetting systems took over&ndash; Monotype, linecasters, film, then digital&ndash;and the wide letters were no longer available. I made a set for Milon, the font I made (with Israel Seldowitz) for Mahzor Lev Shalem. When I showed samples, everyone said &ldquo;no way,&rdquo; for the reason that too many people would be unfamiliar with them. The only reasonable solution, then, was setting the type unjustified. In this font, I&rsquo;m hoping to squeak by with a new strategy, making wide letters that aren&rsquo;t too wide as to be confusing, but wide enough to prevent holes in the lines. Chances are I&rsquo;ll never use them!</p>
<p>Piccic, that is, indeed, Magma&ndash;Sumner&rsquo;s best work, in my opinion. I&rsquo;ve never used the lowercase, just the caps.  <img src="/images/old-images/PhilidorShlomoVII_4201.beta2-2.jpg" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/PhilidorShlomoVII_5904.beta2-9.jpg" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/PhilidorShlomoVII_4426.beta2-8.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But, in reviewing the small text above, Scott-Martin has done something brilliant. The wider width compensates from the thickness of the strokes. As it is said in graphic art talk, there is great color balance of the chet and hay, because the whites spaces between the right and left vertical strokes balance their stroke widths.</p>

<p>You are very perceptive and perceptive of subtleties, but I beg to differ, and choose to defend&rsquo;s Scott-Martin&rsquo;s poetic license and determinations.</p>
<p>There are not as the Israeli slogan, &ldquo;taam v&rsquo;reach etc.&rdquo; - ie his personal artistic leanings, and supra-rational (lit. &ldquo;taste and smell can not be debated&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Rather, there is a reason to his madness, not related to nikud placement or visual design rhythm.</p>

Be that as it may, I&rsquo;m grateful for serious criticism, so fire away, Bill et al. This is a font intended to be read over a long haul at religious services, invariably with nikkud. That it seems to have good display qualities makes me a little cautious. I tend to prefer fonts that have elegant forms, but have the more important characteristic of disappearing as you read them&ndash;the essential Caslon quality, as Bill knows well. Peculiarities are especially unwelcome. What would Mr. Updike say? Fortunately for me, he was a staunch Episcopalian . . .</p>
<p>Here it is, in regular and medium weights, without nikkud. I have not yet completed the kerning, so what you see is fit largely through sidebearings alone.</p>
<p>Best,
Scott</p>
<p>P.S. One thing I am trying to accomplish here is a revival of the extended forms for justification. Because such glyphs vanished with the advent of mechanized typesetting, I am aware that readers are no longer accustomed to them. So I&rsquo;ve made them quite subtle, in hope that they&rsquo;d blend in easily, while at the same time make for tighter lines and paragraphs. That Hebrew readers have become used to very poor, loose composition is quite unfortunate.<img src="/images/old-images/Shlomo7_3813.5.NoNikkud.jpg" alt=""></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think there&rsquo;s a problem trying to look at this on screen, because in converting to pixels, the spacing within and between characters is slightly changed&hellip;</p>
<p>But looking at this small, without nikud, I&rsquo;m wondering whether the shin is too narrow. I am a fanatic about even color, and I don&rsquo;t know if you share that. When I look at samples of Zvi Narkiss&rsquo;s fonts on p. 100 of Language Culture Type, I see an awesome evenness and balance. (I notice he does tricks to lighten the middle stroke of the shin.) I can&rsquo;t really give a good critique because of its being on screen, and my not having done a Hebrew type.</p>
<p>A good, traditional &ldquo;proofing&rdquo; technique is to put every letter between every other letter. In roman type you have strings like this: aaabacadaeafagahaiajakalamanaoapaqarasatauavawaxayaza then babbbcbdbebfb &hellip; etc through the alphabet. Of course you can do the same with Hebrew. Then you print it out small, and some issues pop out that wouldn&rsquo;t be so obvious otherwise.</p>

<p>In my view, there are few traces of influence from David. Also, other charateristics (could name many) are both unique and innovative.</p>
<p>After David and Narkissim broke through the norm of traditional Hebrew typeface designs, I believe Israeli will accept a modern design, such as Shlomo (the son of David).</p>
<p>Critique is valid when it is constructive.</p>
<p>I feel the final chaf must be lighten up a bit, for it looks too heavy compared to the other letters.</p>
<p>I also think the current design of the gimel, in this and other fonts, places the left lower leg too low, so there is too little white space to distinguish it from the nuhn.</p>

So i guess that mine wasn&rsquo;t to your liking
maybe the end result will be very much to my liking.</p>
<p>My critiques war typographical in general, ant not indetail what i have to say about each issue.</p>
<p>Now regarding This new (Old) hebrew face.
MasterFont has a font called &ldquo;LIBI&rdquo; the looks almost the same as this one.
But i like your alot more.</p>
<p>I see you made i distiction betwen qamats qatan and gadol, but not sheva na nach. Why?
3. You hav Dibbukim in some places like in the word וירע.
Also in some cases the taam is too cloes to the nikkud.</p>
<p>but overall, I like this face. also the spacing\kerning looks very good.</p>
<p>There is still work thats needs done on the overall typographic color.
also proportions of letters need some abjusment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>LIBI? I can assure you Masterfont had nothing to do with this!  This is a rather close replica of the principal text type made around 1560 by Guillaume (II) Le Bé for Christophe Plantin&rsquo;s Polyglot Bible. Some years ago, my friend Matthew Carter digitally rendered the display cut for use in Barry Moser&rsquo;s well-known Bible, where they appeared only as numbers for the Psalms. It had never been set up as a proper font. In this collaborative effort, we&rsquo;re making the display as well as the text. Israel Seldowitz will do the encoding after the glyph set is finished. The spacing you see here (sorry, it&rsquo;s not a very clear&ndash;I can&rsquo;t seem to upload a PDF) is sidebearings only&ndash;no kerning table. The nikkud and taamim were placed manually, as a demo. I&rsquo;ll tell Messrs. Le Bé and Plantin that you recommend an adjustment of the proportions.</p>
<p>This is one of the great legacy types from the Golden Age, which, sadly, have been ignored in modern Jewish publishing. We hope it will have a long and healthy revival.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m coming in a little late to this discussion, but I have to agree with typograph. The font Shlomo in it&rsquo;s current form is all over the place. There seems to be no rhythm to the font and seems to be very messy. I think a Hebrew reader will be disturbed by it. On the other hand, Libi is much better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a font designer, rather a typesetter, so I can&rsquo;t tell you why Shlomo doesn&rsquo;t work, just that I wouldn&rsquo;t choose it and I find it unreadable. Sorry if that&rsquo;s not terribly helpeful – but listen to typograph – he seems to understand <em>why</em> it&rsquo;s not readable.</p>
<p>But from what I&rsquo;ve seen, the problem here isn&rsquo;t whether a single letter needs to be wider or thinner or whether the kerning needs to be tweaked, but rather in my eyes, there seems to be a fundamental problem with the font. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be organic. I have to say, that I find it quite hard to read. Sorry :-(</p>

<p>It is not the version or the improvement, but the whole concept. The shin, for example, is  small/too small; the shape is too &lsquo;round&rsquo; &ndash; one solution: playing with the curve of the left arm (see the ayin &ndash; the left arm)</p>

<p>I like your idea on the shin, but then it wouldn&rsquo;t be so consistent with the samech and tet, though more so with the ayin. Maybe there is a problem of consistency, as well as rhythm—which was my main concern above &hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I promised not to show Shlomo again until it&rsquo;s finished, but I will say that many of the things you&rsquo;ve addressed have been changed quite dramatically, including the shapes of the shin, tet, samekh. The proportions of letters have been adjusted, as well. It&rsquo;s been quite transformed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t much participate in blogs, nor do I attend type-centered events. I&rsquo;m a designer, producer, typographer, editor, and sometimes author of books, not a full-time type designer by any means, though I&rsquo;ve been involved with making type from well before the PostScript era. (I spent ten years working with metal.) I&rsquo;m interested in how type performs for readers, not as an end in itself. A very large part of how type works depends on the skill of the compositor, how balance and clarity are brought to bear on the problems at hand. So I&rsquo;m loathe to post large letters for fonts that will only be used small; or small letters at lo-res that inevitably look very poor. If someone can tell me how to post a PDF here (mine are always rejected), I&rsquo;ll post more.</p>
<p>Raphael, your comparison of Shlomo and Libi is invidious and irrelevant; it&rsquo;s apples and oranges. If you wish to compare Libi with the Le Bé that Matthew Carter and I are making, that&rsquo;s another matter. Ever since Mahzor Lev Shalem appeared, you&rsquo;ve taken the opportunity to criticize my work, even if you had to stretch yourself into irrelevance. I find it rude, and I believe it only reflects poorly on you. It would have been nice to have in you a good colleague, as we work on similar things. I remain open to the possibility.</p>
<p>Eli, now I see what LIBI is&ndash;an &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; of the larger Le Bé letters. I&rsquo;m afraid the vigor of the original, and the wonderful sweep of the master punch-cutter, are lost. I don&rsquo;t understand the spacing at all; there&rsquo;s no discipline to the sidebearings.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Rephael, there is a huge differnce between the Koren Face and Shlomo Face.
Koren is what is. no one wants to make a better Koren a more ledgibale Koren.
Koren is a done deal for the good and the bad.</p>
<p>Shlomo however is a font in the making. not just another font, but a font that they are planing to produce with it MACHZORIM, which is going to cost.
so comment of this type face becomes more important.</p>
<p>Now lets forget the fact that i have designed some hebrew faces in the past.
the fact is, that i am an israeli, born in Israel, and hebrew is my native tongue.
and any israeli that has a slight understanding in hebrew typogrophy, will tell you the same.</p>
<p>I have seen bad fonts before, but who cares, so another horrible font exists.
but planning an entier production based on such a font, you should listen to the comments.</p>
<p>no one is here to be rude or insult anothers work.
but for now (before seeing the new shlomo) investing money on a production based on shlomo, is what we would call, &ldquo;PUTING YOUR MONEY ON THE HORNES OF A GAZELLE&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you. Raphael. I think you missed my point, but I am grateful for your apology all the same, and I accept it.</p>
<p>Eli, unless I’ve missed something terribly important, I don’t think living in Israel automatically bestows upon its residents the wisdom of the prophets. I would remind you that a native typographic culture in Israel goes back only to the 1950s. Moshe Spitzer’s Jerusalem Typefoundry (Otiot Y’rushalyim) issued its first catalogue in 1959. The types of Ismar David and Henri Friedlaender were cut in Europe and the United States. It was only with the advent of PostScript that the repertory of Hebrew types was able to expand to some size. Twenty+ years does not a culture make; it’s simply a beginning, perhaps only long enough for a trend to play out. The vast majority of the types made in Israel appear to be intended for advertising or corporate image work, not for long-haul reading.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Hebrew typographic culture of the Diaspora is, for all intents and purposes, as old as type itself. In the West, especially in England and America, our 20th-century type culture was dominated by historical revivals, beginning with William Morris’s interpretation of Jenson and most especially the program of types initiated in the 1920s by Stanley Morison at Monotype (I mean the Monotype that made casting machines, not the digital merchant foundry of today). The Arts &amp; Crafts manner of printing came late to the Jewish world, achieving importance in Germany in the 1920s. Had it followed the West into a next step of historical revivals, it might have resulted in very different types dominating the scene today. But the time was lost—stolen, really. One can only speculate about what might have been. But one may wonder, too, whether a repertory of historically based Hebrew fonts would have been compatible with Zionist ideals, which rejected as much of European culture as it could, Jewish or not.</p>
<p>For those of us of a certain age&ndash;I’m 57&ndash;whose background is metal type (whether working with it or reading it during the formative years), our typographic sensibilities are governed by things you might not have considered: the design “ethic” of the counter-punch, the undesirability of over-regular forms, and, most importantly, the size-specific nature of type design. Your types, which are admirably made, suffer from a lack of these things; your forms are so mechanically regular that they look as if they came from a box of snap-on parts. Moreover, it’s hard to tell what their optimal size might be. Please don’t think for a minute that I’m saying this in defense of Shlomo, which is not yet a defensible product. Rather, I say this because I think you come from a cultural perspective (I have a feeling you’re a generation younger than I am) that’s really very limited. I see that, in your Vilna types, you tried to regularize everything there, too; I find the affect monotonous. Types that look nice and neat often become quite annoying over the long haul. I used to say that too few designers are dedicated readers; sadly, the same can be said today about type designers. You’d do well to look at (and READ) old types, from the time punches were cut by hand, and try to get a sense of how individual quirks of form add up to greater readability, and much less strain on the eyes. Bill Berkson, who’s made an admirable new version of Caslon, understands this well. We have a heritage that’s largely ignored: the types of the Soncinos and Foa and Bomberg, the types of the Le Bés, and the very important types of Solomon Proops, in the 17th century.</p>
<p>I remind you that we Diasporans are at least half of the world’s readers of Hebrew, even more if one includes the small number of Christian scholars and others who read the language regularly. Our tradition of Hebrew reading is some 2000 years old, through the time when there was no conversational Hebrew. Much, though by no means all, of our reading is not the same as yours; it is predominantly religious literature—Torah, siddur, Talmud, and so on. I also remind you that there is a kind of Hebrew reader in the Diaspora that doesn’t exist in Israel: adults who read Hebrew haltingly, as though they were young students. This is a common condition in the liberal congregations for whom I have been making prayer books. Unlike children in Israel, who grow up surrounded by Hebrew letterforms, these people have no such experience. It means that differentiations of letters have to be pronounced in ways you would never have to consider.</p>
<p>My advice to you, Eli: Tse’enah u-re’enah—“go out and look!” The world of Hebrew type did not begin in 1948. And one more thing: good manners are not merely chukkat hagoyim. If you’re unable to cultivate them, you might find the gazelle’s horns sticking into your behind someday.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Scott: I enjoyed reading your last post.
I agree and disagree on a few points.</p>
<p>I am 36 much younger than you, and believe that you have more experience than i in type design. however, as an israeli who lives in israel his intier life, has some expectations from what a hebrew letter should look like.</p>
<p>there is a huge difference between type being designed today and types designed before 1948. generations grew up on HADASSA or FRANKRUEL Ect' so they are used to it allthough they might have their problems. but types being designed today don&rsquo;t have that privilege. readers out side of israel who are surrounded mainly by english don&rsquo;t have these expectations and expect to have in the hebrew letter forms qualities that they meat in the english forms.
So there is for certain an israeli culture, 2 generations are enough to establish a colture. because a 20 yrold person that is all he knows.</p>
<p>Koren Type is a beautiful type face, although one might argue abot its legibility, Koren has become Classic and thats that.</p>
<p>Once again, I have no intention of being rude or insulting your work.
But &ldquo;Tse’enah u-re’enah&rdquo; Post Shlomo on israeli design forums Like TAPUZ &ldquo;Tikshoret Chazutit&rdquo;, ZmanDigitali Or Prog, and see how a native israeli will react.</p>

<p>Scott, My comments have nothing to do with manners.
I express my natural opinion on the type and destiny being questioned, not my opinion on the designer or person.
Unlike Rephael, I have no history with you and i don&rsquo;t even know you, so be sure that there is no politics involved.</p>
<p>So there is no reason to get insulted by my comments.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think there is another very very important factor to realise when it comes to type and that is really <em>how</em> it is read.</p>
<p>Most people reading this forum are reading the English language. Now let&rsquo;s look at the different posts. In some of them, there are spelling mistakes (often due to it being a foreign language). We don&rsquo;t mind them. It doesn&rsquo;t prevent us from reading those posts. Why?</p>
<p>Sometimes there are typos. Again, it doesn&rsquo;t bother us. 
Why?</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at how Hebrew is taught to kids to read. How to people read the Hebrew language? Now people from the diaspora, can you use a siddur without nikud? 
And why not?</p>
<p>The shape of the word including nikud is very important for someone out of Israel who might have been reading Hebrew all their life in their siddur three times a day and out of their Tanakh. But interestingly enough, in my experience, Israelis look and read Hebrew completely differently to people outside of Israel and what they consider to be legible or not is very very different to what people from outside of Israel consider to be legible.</p>
<p>It is true that most faces are designed for advertising and that most books are set in Frankruehl and it takes a publisher with a lot of guts to publish a book set in another face. But one has to think carefully about the face to typeset a siddur.</p>
<p>When I was asked to typeset the new Singer&rsquo;s Prayer Book for Great Britain, we were looking at a number of faces. It seemed natural to try and find something close to the font that the original siddur had been set in. However, after trying many typefaces, the audience wanted the &ldquo;Artscroll font&rdquo;. They had moved over to Artscroll and were used to it. We chose a typeface called FbHadasaNew which is a variation of Hadasa of course and they loved it.</p>
<p>When starting to work for Koren a couple of years later, we were concerned that in the USA, there was a whole generation of people whose only interaction with the Hebrew language was in fact Hadasa (or a slight variation). Was Koren going to be a difficult font to get used to? Was it more or less legible. Israelis agree that it&rsquo;s more, many American&rsquo;s will say less. Why?</p>
<p>Another interesting anecdote. In the UK, Koren has been approached to make a new children&rsquo;s siddur. Unfortunately we have got stuck because the alef and resh are different from&hellip; well Hadasa. And children are taught the letters in rather a strange way it seems. The resh in the siddur font is a real problem because it looks like a vav! I was dumbstruck. Davka I thought that the resh was better because in the Tanakh font the resh and dalet would be very similar to a child&rsquo;s eye. No, they said. The resh and dalet in the Tanakh font are completely different. Go figure!</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is that one has to be very very aware of the target audience. It could be that Shlomo, in the eyes of a worshiper in the United States is a very readable font. And perhaps, people like Eli and I are no longer in the position to comment on this market particularly in light of the comments that I&rsquo;ve posted.</p>
<p>This is an interesting area of type. Does the background and use of the typeface influence the legibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll finish with one final point. I always knew intuitively that to set a quantity of text in italics was a typographic &ldquo;no no&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s hard to read a large amount of text in italic. Yet, there was a period of time that books were set in italic or was this only scribes &ndash; I don&rsquo;t recall. But the point is there. We are not <em>used</em> to seeing text in italic and therefore it&rsquo;s hard to read&hellip;.</p>

<p>Wow!</p>
<p>What feedback?</p>
<p>This blog is barking with great excitement. Are you claiming that the shin of Shlomo has a divine origin?</p>
<p>There are two qualities to Shlomo, that in my opinion, are special.</p>
<p>Like Isamar David&rsquo;s David, Shlomo looks like a sans typeface (even though they are really not a pure sans), and its letter forms are wide like the classic square letters (Hadasa or Vilna).</p>
<p>A wide square-like letter is very important for readability.</p>

<p>With Nikud And Taamim, A would agree with you on that, because the squere letters with all thats happening with nikud and taamim leave more white spaces, and keeps better balance of posetive and negitive spaces.</p>

<p>Square-like (there is no square letter, though the letter form in a Torah scroll uses a 3 x 3 grid) letters, ie those width are close to their height, allow the eye greater time to perceive the letter form.</p>
<p>Letters which are more rectangular do not.</p>
<p>Hence, readability is increased, but there can not be too much details.</p>
<p>Many scribes have reported this. They are true professionals who not only draw letters, but review them every day for hours when they inspect mezuzot etc.</p>
<p>I have heard repeatedly that the Romm Vilna design is most conducive to long bouts of reading/study, because its points are rounded off.</p>

<p>I very much disagree with this stupid statement.</p>
<p>This resembles Rav Shach zatzal&rsquo;s opposition to ArtScroll&rsquo;s translation of the Talmud by saying that such a translation takes away the challenge of deciphering the text. Hence, he was saying the same thing.</p>
<p>I think that the opposite is true.</p>
<p>If we remove or reduce the barriers to comprehending, then the real learning begins.</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiva Eiger zatzal endorsed the Romm Vilna edition of the Talmud specifically because it enhanced intensive study by offering the text to appear in clearer sparkling typefaces.</p>
<p>Learning is greater when reading is not hindered.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eli, this is becoming interesting. I may have been equally guilty taking for granted my cultural references as you have yours. What’s become clear is that we live in two very different Hebrew worlds. In mine, Hebrew appears only as the language of Bible, prayer, and religious study; it seldom appears without nikkud, or nikkud and taamim as the case may be; and it seldom appears without translation in the Latin alphabet, most often accompanied by annotations, and transliterations. Though Hebrew may be the minority of characters on the spread (my books are usually conceived in spreads, not individual pages), it has pride of place. Please take a look at the pages from my Mahzor Lev Shalem, a link for which can be found in the first entry on this blog. It is precisely the kind of work I refer to. <a href="http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/Mahzor.KolNidrei.pdf">http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/Mahzor.KolNidrei.pdf</a></p>
<p>The fit of fonts, and even some glyph designs are inevitably different when one designs primarily for nikkud and taamim. For example, the narrow letters—vav, zayin, yod, nun, and sometimes gimel, have to be a little wider and have broader sidebearings to accommodate the diacriticals without dybukkim, which, in turn, set the standards for the rest of the font. This precludes the kind of tight fit one would deploy for Modern Hebrew, or for a font used in Talmud or other classical texts that don’t use the diacriticals.</p>
<p>Width issues have led to problems adapting some modern fonts for use with nikkud and taamim. Neither Henri Friedlaender nor Ismar David designed their most famous fonts with diacriticals in mind. Ismar drew a set of nikkud for Interype David (I believe they were for filmsetting, never implemented), though some of these were very strange. From what I’ve seen produced at the Israeli typefoundries, diacriticals are an afterthought, when they exist at all. Nothing is done to refit the fonts to accommodate them, nor are size issues addressed. In the Koren Siddur, I find it disturbing and inadequate to see large types set from the text master. I also find it very strange to see the nikkud line set so far down from the baseline (as Koren had done for reasons of technical limitations), which makes tighter leading very difficult to achieve without creating high-decibel noise on the page. Why repeat what Eliyahu Koren felt he had to do, if there’s no longer a reason to do so? It’s not as if the design was handed down on Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>The typographic issues I face in my work are extremely elaborate, much more so than in any prayerbooks one would find in Israel, and even more so than in most Orthodox prayerbooks, such as Raphael’s Koren Siddur. The Artscroll siddurim can be elaborate, too, but typographic refinement and easy readability is not a concern of theirs. David Hamuel stated the obvious in saying that metal is dead. What he neglected to say was that its principals are not. It’s for that reason that the best Latin text types made today are created as multiple masters and packaged as separate fonts for size-specific application. Some examples include Adobe’s Premier Pro series, many of the types from DTL, Enschedé Font Foundry, Font Bureau (in its newspaper types), H&amp;FJ (such as Mercury), and a number of serious independents (Feliciano, Storm, et al.) One cannot make a book like Mahzor Lev Shalem without them. What is dead is one-size-fits-all types for text. This was just an aberration that existed for a short time, as technologies were in transition. For types that have exaggerated thicks and thins, such as Vilna, you MUST have separate size masters. God doesn’t like lazy people.</p>
<p>A clarification for David Hamuel: I used the word “pronounced” in the sense of “emphasized,” not in the sense of “vocalization.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Raphael makes some valuable observations that I hadn’t read before my previous posting. Readability is a highly acculturated value that changes, sometimes dramatically, over time. Throughout the much of the 19th century and into the 20th, American books were chiefly set in various versions of the Scotch Roman, a kind of type one might think of as the Anglo-American Bodoni. These were the first kinds of type made available for machine setting because they were considered the standard. A change—a slow change—came when the highly influential printer Theodore Low De Vinne (1828-1914) introduced types of similar proportions that reduced the contrast of thick and thin. These types eased the way for the “Oldstyle Revival” of the 20th century, which still dominates book typography here. (We Americans are very conservative about discarding embedded traditions; there are things that originated in England that long since vanished there, but remain vital here.)</p>
<p>Today, people read Scotch and its derivatives with considerable discomfort, yet in the 19th century, when literacy expanded dramatically in this country, they were as mother’s milk. Our visual culture had changed. Except in the Hasidic world, the once dominant Frank-Ruehl has largely disappeared, too, especially in the liberal communities, where Hadassah and David (in one rotten version or another) took its place. When Artscroll began using a version of Hadassah, this pretty much marked the end of the Frank-Ruehl era—at least until it’s rediscovered as hip in another generation or two. Type in the West has always been a revolving door, moving century by century. To the eyes of my generation (I was born in 1953), types of the 16th and 18th centuries look “normal,” whereas types of the 19th and 17th centuries present readability problems. I generalize, of course, but I believe my central claims are valid. Raphael, this fits with your remarks about the extended use of italics. I would add, though, that the brief vogue for long italic texts, in the 16th century, used types that were made by geniuses such as Arrighi and Granjon, not ordinary men. The individuality of the forms (Eli might shriek that they’re not real fonts because they’re not mechanically consistent) is something very difficult to duplicate with our modern, perfect tools. Moreover, no fonts were ever so unequivocally size specific. Robert Slimbach, a man of very great skill and critical eye, has been trying to get there for years—and I am sure he will keep trying for many years to come. One thing’s for sure: the forms don’t lend themselves to good screen rendering, though that will change in time.</p>
<p>There are historical parallels throughout the Latin-alphabet world, and a situation that’s related, yet quite different, in Germany, which had gone in and out of blackletter and Latin for some time. (Interestingly, the Germans are unusually accepting of sans serifs for long texts.) When I mentioned that Israel’s (Eretz Israel’s) type culture is a very young one, I said it in the context of my own culture, where the trends have been historically very long. No doubt, rapid technological changes will shorten the cycles, and as every type manufacturer is spending a lot of time these days with screen types, it is very hard to predict how long the trends will be. If screen technology becomes even more sophisticated, as it has on hand-helds, we may be in for a Scotch revival yet!</p>
<p>When I began the design of Mahzor Lev Shalem, I was asked by the Rabbinical Assembly, the publisher, to use Hadassah, as that was what appeared in their more recent prayerbooks. I knew I was in for some trouble. I bought Masterfont’s version, and quickly discarded it. Then I bought Fb HadasaNew. The weight was a little closer to what I needed (a little too heavy), but I didn’t like the glyph designs, which I thought were too reduced and perfunctory. I contacted them and asked if they would work with me: I would redo the glyphs and sidebearings, they would do the rest. Lo tov—they didn’t understand what I wanted, or didn’t want to. It was then that I got in touch with Israel Seldowitz (I knew his brother, Mark, as the U.S. agent for AdobeME products). We were soon off and running. The resulting font, which I called Milon, is inspired by Hadassah, weighted somewhat like HadasaNew (though a little lighter), but something different and new. I still haven’t made a full titling version, as the only large type in the book is on the title page and cover; for those, I altered the small number of characters I needed in Illustrator. For the small Hebrew text in the commentaries, I used an available David, heavily adjusted, but still not fully satisfactory. Our time was very short; the entire 944-page book was produced by me alone, in 22 months, with much other work going on at the same time. The David&ndash;if it will still be David, which is not a type suited to diacriticals&ndash;will be redone for the next large printing, in the spring.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Scott-Martin and Raphael, I do not agree that readability is only a matter of familiarity. As I mentioned earlier, the period for doing all italic books was short, and never returned to. And the reaction against high contrast, such as Bodoni for text has not reverted in over a century.</p>
<p>In my view even rhythm and color help the eye-brain combination to easily decode the words, and having these uneven contributes to &ldquo;noise&rdquo; that makes reading less comfortable.</p>
<p>The question of how much this is a matter of human nature vs familiarity has been an on-going debate on Typophile. My own analysis of the issue will be shortly up on &ldquo;iLoveTypography.com&rdquo;, so I won&rsquo;t repeat it here.</p>
<p>But, Scott-Martin, I do think that when you have three Israelis, who actually <em>read</em> Hebrew, as opposed to decoding it and reciting it, telling you that there is a problem reading your font, I think that should be ringing a lot of warning bells to you about rhythm and color.</p>
<p>It is true that reading Hebrew as a native speaker and what diaspora Jews do is a different process psychologically, but I doubt that it is so different that a more readable font with nikud for Israelis is a less readable one for diaspora Jews. I think you are probably right that a wider font is more compatible with nikud, and that is an interesting and insightful point. But I don&rsquo;t think that changes the need for even rhythm and color.</p>
<p>These were the issues on which I was commenting above, but with my &ldquo;type design&rdquo; hat on, and without the confidence of someone who knows the Hebrew language well. As I said earlier, I really like the visual idea of the terminals on your font, and I wish you well with it. But I do think it can fully succeed only if you get the relationship between characters to the point where Israelis also will find it a comfortably reading font.</p>

<p>Are you saying the alignment has no rhyme or reason? No logical consistancy - simply based upon E. Koren&rsquo;s eye, and occasional slip of the finger? So, how is Masterfont&rsquo;s Volt version 100%? Did he make a huge exception table of various strings, each with different alignmemt rules?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>of course there was rhyme and reason. He had drawings for the placement of each vowel and taam and rules for each one. The three people that worked on the pages, namely Shuki Friedman, Prof Ada Yardeni (she of course wasn&rsquo;t quite as famous in those days :-)) and one other (whose name I forget), then placed the nikud on the pages. Prof Yardeni relates that the first page of Bereshit took her a full day to do! She sped up after that :-)</p>
<p>There of course were many inconsistencies in how collisions were dealt with and this can be seen on the very first page of the Tanakh. However, with time, each of the people working on it, got better at it.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned many times on this forum, the Volt programming was done by Koren under my and Esther Be&rsquo;er&rsquo;s strict supervision. The font wasn&rsquo;t programmed by Masterfont. I have also stated that the table <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> 100%. It can&rsquo;t be because VOLT couldn&rsquo;t compile so many collisions. I have already stated this on many occasions. However it&rsquo;s pretty much 95%, and each string of letter, nikud, taam combination is now consistent. The final corrections are done in a separate program programmed in flex for InDesign.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe me, and your comment of &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; suggests that you don&rsquo;t, then you are welcome to call up Prof Ada Yardeni and she can show you the process of how she stuck down the nikud and taamim. She still has the original stuff from over 50 years ago!</p>

<p>Rephael, this is not true. Volt is capable of handing an unlimited number of look-ups. My Volt programs contain more unused look-ups (some Christian scholars use a sequence where the meteg is placed between the nikkud and the taam) than all you could imagine.</p>
<p>I once experimented by copying and pasting all these unused look-ups, to see it Volt could produce such a font. Whalah, it worked. And InDesign CS/X ME didn&rsquo;t crash either.</p>
<p>The factor wasn&rsquo;t processing or crashing. It was gelt.</p>

<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t the medium. It&rsquo;s the consistency of the system that Mr. Koren used. Were there specific rules of placement used in general, which were modified to avoid collisions?</p>
<p>If there were a set of logical rules:
eg. the nikkud is centered under these letters, justified right by these letters, the taamim are offset to the left of the nikkud, the meteg is offset to either the taam or the nikkud etc.</p>
<p>My quess that there is no unique system, and the workers erred now and them, as you intimidate.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Raphael, I was aware of the laborious method Koren deployed to apply the diacriticals to his Bible, using dry transfer over letterpress proofs of type cast by Deberny &amp; Peignot at 36 pt Didot. Perhaps you can shed some light on a few things, for the historical record. What was in the full glyph set of the metal font? Did it comprise only alphabetic glyphs, or did it include dagesh characters, too, or vav-cholom combinations? What led to his decision to place the lower diacriticals so far from the baseline? Did he have a technical or practical reason for it, or was it an aesthetic decision? If it was the latter, on what precedent(s) did he base this very unusual decision? If it was for optical clarity, as he claimed, why then are the upper nikkud so close to the letters? And, though I am aware Koren wanted to accord the letters what he considered their “natural” form, why did he draw a lamed with a longer ascender than was necessary to achieve that, thereby creating visual and technical problems with the lower nikkud and taam on the previous line?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the Koren letters, per se, are not difficult to read as calligraphic types go, but the way they are composed with nikkud and taamim make for an unpleasant reading experience. This is an opinion I know is shared by some very highly regarded Bible scholars, one of whom had quoted, in regard to Koren’s Bible, Samuel Johnson’s famous quip about Milton’s epic poems, “I’d rather praise them than read them.” As one is today working in an entirely different medium than did Koren, himself, why not reinterpret his work for our time? I’m very involved with the reproduction in print of art photography, where the question of medium-appropriateness comes up all the time. Printing and photography are two different things; the chemistry of photo prints becomes part of the fabric of the paper, whereas the offset printing process merely deposits a small number of ink molecules on the surface of the paper. Digital prints are more like offset, but can look richer because the molecular density of the inks is much greater. To be successful and convincing in the reproduction of pictures, one must engage in a sensitive act of interpretation appropriate to each medium and each photographer&rsquo;s style. My earlier discussion of size-specific types is not so different from this, at least not philosophically. As it applies to Koren’s work, I always thought his Bible looked like something that had been reduced photographically, which it was. So much for his claims of purity. In fairness, though, he did what he had to do. The questions now is why perpetuate the exigencies of another time? Were Koren were around today, do you not think he would have tried to use the current technology to its fullest extent?</p>

<p>I think I misunderstood you to start with. Yes there was a system. The nikud is centered under the letter and the taamim are placed to the left of them. If there is no room, then different techniques were employed depending on the location of other letters. Since the Bible was already printed before the nikud was put in, then he took into account the text that was on the following line, something that when we digitised the font we couldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>So there was a system, but yes, people weren&rsquo;t perfect and made mistakes.</p>

<p>Gohebrew: this is true.</p>
<p>Scott-Martin:
I believe that the metal font only had the alphabetical glyphs. I haven&rsquo;t seen them, but I do know the man that has them!</p>
<p>When you refer to the lower diacriticals, do you mean the taamim or the nikud in general. I have to say that I have never found them to be low. It&rsquo;s interesting that this has been brought up.</p>
<blockquote>

Really? Again, this is very interesting. I happen to find it extremely easy to leyn from. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m used to it.</p>

I wasn&rsquo;t aware of such claims.</p>

<blockquote>

Now that is a very interesting question. He probably would have wanted too, but the cost of doing so is rather exhorbitant!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Rephael,</p>
<p>This is a radical approach that places the greater importance upon the nikkud, and secondary importance upon the taam, when they are combined.</p>
<p>When only a taam appears under the letter, I assume it is treated like nikkud. Is this correct?</p>
<p>When a meteg follows the nikkud, or just a taam, is then the meteg off center to the left?</p>
<p>This system has advantage in that the child understands the taam is in deed secondary and different from the nikkud.</p>
<p>This system though has a few major flaws, though, in that 
a) it is not aesthetic, 
b) it will never work by most narrow letters, and even some middle-width letters,
because this system produces left-dominant alignment.</p>
<p>In books and manuscripts that I have seen, this system used by Koren, and another more aesthetic and logical approach to alignment appear.</p>
<p>In the bits of the Aleppo Codex <a href="http://www.aleppocodex.org/newsite/index.html">http://www.aleppocodex.org/newsite/index.html</a> that we have, clearly this system used by Koren is seen. The difficulty here though is the obvious fact that the nikkud was drawn after the text. Hence, perhaps, the taam was drawn after the nikkud.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the book, &ldquo;Hebrew Manuscripts: A Treasured Legacy&rdquo;, by Binyamin Richler, published by the Ofeq Institute in 1990, there are two illuminated manuscripts that display the system not used by Koren.</p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/manuscript 1_3438.jpg)</p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/psalms 9_6058.jpg)</p>
<p>Yet, the system used by Koren does have its roots also in traditional Jewish publishing.</p>

<p>I have decided that my Crown will have the alignment system not used by Koren.</p>
<p>I have a few versions of FrankReuhl, so some will have his preferred system, and some will not.</p>
<p>In general, I prefer the alignment system which he scorned. Its inconsistency makes no sense, except to you. It enables you to reject anything different, even though I have shown you two ancient manuscripts which support this very system that he scorned. Plus, the Aleppo evidence can be interpreted either way.</p>
<p>Hence, unless you can bring supporting evidence, I respectfully think you&rsquo;re wrong. Let any intelligent human review the supporting documentation and rationale, and he or she will arrive at the same conclusion: Koren&rsquo;s method makes no sense.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware that he scorned anything.</p>
<p>You are very welcome to use any system that you see fit. You asked me what Koren&rsquo;s approach was, I told you. I happen to like his approach. You don&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s okay. Do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Yes, the nikud is secondary and the taamim is tertiary. I never actually met Koren, but this is what his system seems to indicate. However, I did meet Tzvi Narkis and he told me that his (ie Narkis) system was also to make the nikud secondary and the taamim tertiary. Again, I don&rsquo;t know whether this was an aesthetic, historical, or halakhic decision, but rather that was his decision too.</p>
<p>There are very few Hebrew typographers in the world that have been recognised as being &ldquo;great&rdquo; in their field, and even fewer that designed fonts with taamey mikra. I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that Koren and Narkis were 2 of these people and it&rsquo;s interesting that they both came up with <em>exactly</em> the same system. I suspect it was therefore not random.</p>
<p>Do you have any other examples of great typographers that have come up with different systems?</p>
<p>BTW, you should know that revered Publishing House, Kol Menachem, also follows this exact same system. I&rsquo;m not sure if you agree with them religiously, but I know that they are very fanatical about precision.</p>

<p>This is not a proof.</p>
<p>Obviously, they were aware of each other&rsquo;s work. Perhaps, they even influenced each other.</p>
<p>Another, even greater Hebrew type designer, who created nikkud and taam, was the late Isamar David. Did he follow in these footsteps?</p>
<p>Rabbi Chaim Miller of the Gutnick Chumash fame (Kol Menachem) is my very good friend, and a fellow Lubavitcher. Although a tremendous Torah scholar, his mastery of typesetting leaves much to be desired.</p>
<p>Finally, the story is told of very poor communities in Czarist Russia, which could not afford to hire both a Chassidic rabbi, and a Litvish rabbi. Instead, they hired only one, based on which segment was larger in the community.</p>
<p>In towns that hired a Litvish rabbi, the chassidic Jews asked their Rebbe what to do? He advised them: &ldquo;Ask your question to the Litvish rabbi, and then do the very opposite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, he drew a font for Tanach with nikkud and taam. He even set a page as an example.</p>
<p>Do you have the thin book called I think the Hebrew letter. It was sold in the early nineties, and had a pull-out section of cards. I believe that he wanted them created. I intend to do that.</p>

<p>I never said I liked the Koren siddur.</p>
<p>Rabbi Miller&rsquo;s genius is the content. I told Chaim to make it searchable, for in a few years most people will search PDFs. He hasn&rsquo;t listened.</p>
<p>His books are typeset by him. Did he typeset the Siddur? Or you typeset his English? His English stuff is now very attractive.</p>

<p>The Kol Menachem system employs the same system as Koren (surprise, surprise) as does the Keter Tanakh. I have to check Mossad HaRav Kook and Chorev, but I&rsquo;m fairly sure they also do the same system, but I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>

I have no idea about their financials.</p>
<p>I think the positioning of Artscroll that you have shown isn&rsquo;t really the best positioning in the world. Look at the word VeChol or VeAta. The shva is too far to the left by all systems. The moment the basic nikud is poorly and inconsistently positioned, you can really use it as an example of taamey mikra.</p>

<p>Please back up your statement that it is intellectual property to correctly place a shvah-na where it should appear in a verse?</p>

<p>I think that this statement is incorrect, and not merely over zealous.</p>
<p>I have 8 kids, and many versions Bereshes and Shmos from their days in yeshiva katana, elementary school.</p>
<p>Most are typeset aesthetically (with the nikud and taam centered as one unit, and not with only the nikud centered, and the taam offset to the left), and without a patach kenuva. Tow fairly recent publications, Chorev from Feldheim, and HaMaor, both do feature a patach kenuva, but only Chorev/Feldheim follows the Koren-like alignment system.</p>

<p>Therefore, if Shay L&rsquo;Mora has done extensive work (and they have) and have determined based on research of masora etc that the shva na in a certain place, then this indeed cannot be copied.</p>
<p>This first came up with a project that I started for Gefen Publishing House. They were doing a work on Onkelus and needed an accurate Chumash text. I was a freelance typesetter and said why not just proofread it against Koren (since everyone knows that this is the most accurate text &ndash; I wasn&rsquo;t an employee at the time). They checked with their lawyers and said you can&rsquo;t proofread against Koren (or any other text for that matter, unless the text has been expressly put in the public domain, eg the DavkaWriter text). This is a simple extension of that legal advice.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s okay in the States &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know. But in Israel it&rsquo;s most certainly illegal.</p>

<p>As I understand US Copyright law regarding a public domain work, one can not copy the image that one sees, but the content is not subject to copyright.</p>
<p>The Chumash is public domain. The rules defined by the Minchat Shai are public domain.</p>
<p>To copy his page, with his custom typeface, is in deed a violation of copyright. That&rsquo;s the image.</p>
<p>But to copy its content, that a shvah-na symbol appears above the second shva is the word plini in Genesis x:x, this is content, and public domain.</p>

<p>Like any graphic symbol, there are laws in the US to protect them, such as design patent, and to a lesser degree, trademark.</p>
<p>Your point about ideas versus the expression of ideas is correct. The expression of ideas is subject to US Copyright, but ideas alone are not.</p>
<p>In the previous posts, the discussion is a public domain work.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Israeli legal system extends certain rights to a derivative work based 100$ upon a public domain work, as Raphael pointed out.</p>
<p>As I understand US Copyight law based 100$ upon a public domain work, no rights are extended.</p>
<p>Hence, ArtScroll must place its 100$ upon a public domain work as the property of the not-for-profit Mesorah Heritage Foundation, and only subject to US Copyright the entire image of the page of ArtScroll.</p>
<p>Even its translation is ownerless, for it was paid 100% by public funds, and ArtScroll could only subject to US Copyright the entire image of the page.</p>

<p>Yes, technically he may be right about Artscroll&rsquo;s translation, but is it <em>fair</em> to copy their translation in part? I mean, is everything we do based on whether somebody followed some copyright protocol? Is it okay for a kid to copy their friend&rsquo;s homework if their friend didn&rsquo;t first file it at the copyright office?

<p>The sales advantage of their books is not this feature, nor that it has kamatz-katens. People do not buy it for that at all. They like its clearly typeset text (does KP own a copyright on clarity?), and simple-to-understand commentary.</p>
<p>Why does Raphael play the moral part, when his firm attempts to enforce its rights in court?</p>
<p>Copyright laws define what is allowed and what is not.</p>
<p>Torah law is stricter in many regards, and also more lenient when it comes to יגדיל תורה ויאדיר promoting the study of Torah.</p>
<p>I thin a court of Jewish law, Raphael would lose.</p>
<p>Anyway, GoHebrew&rsquo;s Cbhumash will follow R' Zalman Henna&rsquo;s Hebrew grammar principles, and not he typeset in Crown. B&quot;H.</p>

<p>For Mahzor Lev Shalem, I designed a special character to denote bowing. The character was based on a paleo-Hebrew kaf (as in &ldquo;korim&rdquo;). This is original work, so in theory it could be copyrighted or trademarked. But why would one want to take ownership of such a thing? I would be pleased if others would wish to imitate it. Moreover, on what basis could one defend it in court? In America, one would have to prove that the infringing party has impaired the commerce of the copyright holder&ndash;very unlikely in a case such as this. To obtain injunctive relief through the courts, to prevent someone from publishing a work with the purloined symbol, would be nothing but mean-spirited and therefore, in my opinion, against precepts of halakhah.</p>
<p>The problem with font design copyright, which arguably does not exist in the U.S., is that the white space (sidebearings, kerning) is as much, if not greater, part of a font&rsquo;s performance as are the glyph outlines. Defending white space in court would take the resources of a billionaire with a lot of time on his or her hands.</p>

<p>Does KP warn the reader as such regarding the placement of the kamatz katan, shvah-na, and mileil, to indicate its consideration of ownership of such matters?</p>
<p>Is taking this immoral?</p>
<p>The Talmud reports that a certain family knew how to burn sacrifices in such a manner in which the fire rose straight up. Only they knew this. They refused to share this knowledge.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In both essence and practicality, there is no defensibility  the U.S. for such a thing as Koren&rsquo;s diacritical usage. For one thing, the diacriticals are being applied to what U.S. courts would believe to be the most public of all public domain texts: the Bible. The originality of Koren&rsquo;s interpretation of ancient sources would be very hard to establish as meaningful. The criterion that Bill mentioned, whether or not the copyright holder&rsquo;s ability to sell his work was impaired by someone&rsquo;s borrowing (the defendant would simply call it &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;) an interpretation, is the gold standard of our copyright law. Being &ldquo;right&rdquo; is neither here nor there in the U.S.; our system is based on the establishment of provable damages. Practically speaking, each side of a dispute would have to rely on expert testimony, so the cost of a such a defense could easily exceed any potential income for decades, even centuries, to come.</p>
<p>My personal (and professional) opinion is that Koren&rsquo;s diacriticals are simply an &ldquo;idea,&rdquo; an interpretation of sources which are, therefore, outside the reach of legal protection here&ndash;as well they should be. I can imagine that, in Israel, it&rsquo;s easier to find a judge who knows something about the kamatz katan than it is in America, but even so, our system of jurisprudence would frown on a case such as this as &ldquo;frivolous,&rdquo; and likely dismiss it. In some states, the litigant would be liable for covering the defendant&rsquo;s legal costs. In Massachusetts, they could even pay &ldquo;treble&rdquo; (3x) damages.</p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t know of any serious Bible scholars who still rely on Koren&rsquo;s Bible text. It&rsquo;s been superseded by others, most notably Breuer&rsquo;s (at al.) Keter Yerushalayim. Now that facsimiles are available of all the key texts, it&rsquo;s open season.</p>

<p>Regarding Keter Yerushalayim, I just have one question: Which of Breuer&rsquo;s text is most accurate? the Mossad Harav Kook, the Keter Yerushalayim or the Chorev? They are all Breuer, they all claim to be perfect, but they are of course are all different because of Israeli copyright laws!</p>
<p>At least with Koren, we only have one version!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Raphael, Regarding the scholarly texts, I believe that, at the moment, there&rsquo;s no single set, but rather a group that must be consulted: the Yosef Ofer (at al.) revision of Breuer (Jerusalem Crown, 2000), the Mikraot Gedolot Haketer published by Bar-Ilan University (in progress), and the Hebrew University Bible Project (also in progress). And with the Masoretic sources available online, one can make ad hoc editorial decisions in ways one could not earlier. Even an am haaretz like me can read the Aleppo or Leningrad in all their glory, and frankly, as someone accustomed to interpreting old lettering from a technical point of view, I have sometimes come to different conclusions than some of the scholarly gedolim.</div>

<p>Look there are different opinions out there as to which is the most accurate. Obviously I have to say that the Koren one is :-)</p>
<p>I should also point out that in Israel, if there is a disagreement in shul on the leyning, nobody pulls out a Breuer, but everybody, dati leumi, charedi, ashkenazi, sepharadi, will ALWAYS pull out a Koren to settle a dispute. So it has become the accepted correct text for better (in our case) or for worse.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are scholars who claim the Cairo Codex is not authentic, or, at least, not from the early 9th century, as was claimed. Be that as it may, Bible scholarship goes on, from one school of thought to another. Such is the nature of fashion. As a typographer, I believe there&rsquo;s more than just ratiocination that goes into interpreting the diacriticals from these sources, attempts to extract a perfect system from things that might not have been perfectly systematic. The good news for us is that they&rsquo;ll continue publishing Bibles, each more &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; than the one before, and we&rsquo;ll all have lots of work. God willing, older sources will be found and we&rsquo;ll have to reset everything.</p>
<p>Back to an earlier topic: by U.S. law, my little bowing sign can be patented and trademarked (and thereby defensible from copiers), but probably not copyrighted, because it functions as a complement to the alphabet. Similarly, a typeface name can be trademarked, but the type design itself has little protection, except as digital code. Even if one could come up with a cogent definition of &ldquo;design,&rdquo; there are very large commercial interests in this country who have and will fight the idea of a design copyright with great vigor and money, because its existence could call into question much of what they consider their property. It&rsquo;s not an equitable system.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I found this interesting blog post by Michael Factor, a British-born Israeli patent attorney, regarding font protection in Israel. Here&rsquo;s the link (scroll down a bit): <a href="http://blog.ipfactor.co.il/category/israel-ip/">http://blog.ipfactor.co.il/category/israel-ip/</a></p>
<p>For those of you interested in the intricacies of U.S. copyright in general, I recommend the blog of William Patry, who&rsquo;s widely regarded as one the the leading copyright attorneys in America (many say the foremost). Sadly, Patry sold out to the Evil Copyright Empire, Google, and serves as their Senior Copyright Counsel. Nevertheless, his blog often offers his personal view, which is always smart and nuanced. As he is quick to point out, it&rsquo;s a personal blog, not a Google blog, though his position no doubt limits some of the topics he discusses. <a href="http://williampatry.blogspot.com/">http://williampatry.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth knowing this stuff; a good knowledge of copyright law can help designers understand what they can own, and what they can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s knowledge that can be used profitably.</p>
