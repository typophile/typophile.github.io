  body: "If I clearly remember, this is an exclusive typeface made by Terminal Design
    for Vogue and called \"Vogue Avant-Garde\". It mixes [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/|Avant-Garde]]
    and influences from (light weights of) [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]]
    (pointy /A, /N, /W...). [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/olround-gothic/|OL
    Round Gothic]] is close too (as Century Gothic you've already found).\r\nI like
    [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik|Graphik]] and [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/platform|Platform]]
    even if I assume they can't be considered as similars."
