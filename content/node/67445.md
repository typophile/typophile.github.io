  body: Managed to figure out one of the faces. Sentico Sans DT from DTP Types is
    the typeface for the CrossCountry.png image file. Just need help with the MorningNewsletter
    typeface.

  body: I solved my own font caper. It's neither Sentico Sans DT nor Klavika. It is
    in fact Font Bureau's "Stainless." Does it count when you solve your own Type
    ID post?... LOL!
