body: My organisation is eager to meet accessibility guidelines for documentation.
  The result will be the default typeface on some 400 PCs. We&#39;re using system
  fonts, specifically Arial. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure what the best way to proceed
  is. It&#39;s been suggested that the RNIB guidelines should be a starting point.
  This suggests a 2mm x-height as a minimum. <BR> <BR>By my reckoning, 10.5pt Arial
  does the 2mm x-height trick. I was encouraged to increase this to 11pt, which is
  okay. This week, I find that some people in the organisation want it increased further,
  to 12pt. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s people&#39;s thoughts on this kind of thing? <BR> <BR>Personally,
  I feel that 12pt Arial doesn&#39;t do anyone any favours, and that other choices
  might be better for people with visual impairment. However, it&#39;s very difficult
  to put this view across to people who&#39;ve read literature saying things like
  &#34;A 12pt sans serif such as Arial or Helvetica should be the minimum, and 14pt
  would be better&#34;. <BR> <BR>Is there any useful reference or research on this
  kind of thing? I found <a href="http://www.tireasis.org" target="_blank">http://www.tireasis.org</a>,
  but could do with something containing specific information about print.
