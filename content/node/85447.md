  body: "Hi Bob,\r\n\r\nThe number of fonts reported by Find my Font is about 190.000,\r\nbut
    this number includes also the 'fake' Italic (Oblique) fonts generated internally\r\nby
    the Application when an Italic font is missing.\r\nA rough estimation of the actual
    font files is about 120.000 but many of them are duplicates (same font in different
    directory/collection).\r\n"
