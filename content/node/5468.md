body: I&#39;m looking to download a free type-manager software &#40;for XP Pro&#41;
  that has open/close button &#40;that&#39;s not install/uninstall&#41;. Basically,
  I don&#39;t want the computer to have to read all the 2000 typefaces but only the
  ones that I&#39;ve activated. I&#39;m sure ATM Deluxe has that, but I want to download
  something for free. I downloaded from download.com &#40;for PC&#41; The Font Thing
  and X-Fonter, but they don&#39;t seem to do that. Thanks. <BR> <BR>James

  body: While we&#39;re at it, I&#39;m looking for a free version of the new Sabon,
    one that gives me all those great ligutures, ornaments, and old style figures.
    I&#39;m sure that Linotype&#39;s Sabon NEXT has that, but I want to download something
    for free. I haven&#39;t found anything close enough on freefonts.com!

    CS application with them :-P <BR>

  body: I just had another look at Linotype&#39;s Sabon NEXT by some guy named &#34;Jean
    F Porchez&#34;.  The Sabon is even more fantastic than I remembered the first
    time I saw it.  Too bad guys who do incredible work like that never post on Typophile.
    If they did, I would have to tell them what great work they do and that would
    sound too childish for an old man like me to say.
