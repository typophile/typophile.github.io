  body: Meredith - <BR> <BR>I lived in Seattle for several years and both bookstores
    you listed are among my favorites.  I still get up there about once a month and
    try to make it to both stores.  I&#39;m a big supporter of independent bookstores
    - I think I paid for the construction of the addition to Powells &#40; <a href="http://www.powells.com"
    target="_blank">http://www.powells.com</a> &#41;, here in Portland, when I lived
    four blocks away for five years.  I agree with you on the &#34;crappy websites.&#34;

    159 Prince St., although their site must be under renovation.

  body: 'In Washington, DC: <BR> <BR>Franz Bader art and design bookstore on the corner
    of 19th and I Streets. This store not only has a really nice selection, but the
    design of the store itself is very cool: custom designed streamlined Deco-esque
    wood shelving and furniture, a mini-display of 1930&#39;s-era telephones, and
    their logo is set in Cassandre&#39;s Bifur. Check it out if you have the chance.'
