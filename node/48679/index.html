  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Basically, I'm just starting out in type design. The biggest problem I face is that, whether we like it or not, we all walk around and subconsciously take in things and copy them later. So I suppose my question is: How do you know that your design, something you may indeed spend years developing, is original, or at least different enough from what's out there? It seems impossible to be aware of ALL typefaces out there. The good ones, yes that's possible, but there must be unknown type designers out there doing fantastic work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi There

It is hard to be original.

What I always try to do is design a concept first and then the actual design.
Everything you do has been done before by an other. Being 100% original is impossible.
You could try, but it is hard.

It is no shame looking around for inspiration. But, be aware of copying.
If things have no purpose, just leave them out.

I a way trends are an example of this. Light letters, gradients ... you see them around.
Are you less original when using that? I think it is about communication.
What is it you want to communicate.

If you can start a trend, I think you are original. Even though the actual trend has been done before.


I hope this helps.

		<div class="commentbody">I cannot speak directly about type design but as a musician, there was a moment in my mid-twenties when I stopped practicing and started playing. That's also when I stopped being a fan.

After that I was not interested what other musicians were up to, especially those that were doing something close to what I was trying to do.

Being a primarily an ear-trained musician means that whatever I hear, I play. So I have to be really careful not to get poisoned.

I've had this conversation with many of my type design colleagues and the consensus is that not looking at other peoples work is the best way to stay true to your own ideas. I suppose it is easier if you only design type and do no graphic design. But I stopped doing graphic design years ago, so I have no need or desire to look at other contemporary work,

		<div class="commentbody">Instead of NOT looking at the work of other professionals you could try to look at the work of a LOT of your peers — that will be a lot more instructive that shutting out everything.

And then there a lot of ‘laws’ in (graphic) design; learning them and especially learning to recognize them will help you knowing to decide whether you will adhere to them or not.

Nothing wrong with learning from the masters…

		<div class="commentbody">It's very easy to make your glyphs original.
Just don't refer to other types when you're drawing them.
If you start with a concept, and then work it out by drawing the glyphs, then the natural personality of your "hand" (including eye and brain) will express itself in an individual creation.
You will get the shape of the glyphs "right" not by comparing them one-on-one with the glyphs of other typefaces, but by trying to make your face work in various text settings.

Consider the featured face Netto. It looks to me like "Dax meets DIN in a Rapidograph template". That's a sufficiently original concept, if drawn out the way Daniel Utz has done it, with his own taste in the proportions of the letters, the quality of the curves, and the "speed" they transition into the straights. Then there is the question of fit, determined by the width of sidebearings among other things.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As you have noted Kris, I have indeed designed a few revivals.
But what has that got to do with my advice?

It's a bit harder to make revivals "different enough".
So beginners seeking originality should avoid them.

However, taking a crack at reviving an incunabula face might not be a bad idea--the print quality is so rough that a lot of interpretation is required. If you're going to do that, best to avoid Jenson and Griffo.</div>
