body: 'I''m involved with a nonprofit organization that''s working to establish a
  <a href="http://www.chichess.org">chess center</a> in Chicago. We''ve adopted Neutraface
  No. 2 as our "signature" typeface, in our logo and elsewhere: unlike other chess
  centers, which generally go the "O we are so highbrow and elegant" route, we''re
  projecting a more muscular, no-frills image, while also honoring the essentially
  geometric nature of the game. I''m looking for a good companion serif face for use
  in marketing materials and in-house publications (one of the benefits we plan to
  offer members is a yearbook featuring analyzed chess games). At first I used Minion,
  but while it works well in some applications, it clashes in running text. Then I
  was drawn to Electra, which isn''t bad, but the more I look at it, the more I feel
  that the high contrast in stroke widths makes it a weak partner. Bodonis and Didots
  are just too eccentric; Garamonds and even Hoefler Text, too old-fashioned. Suggestions?'

  body: "Telefon is pretty (and a strong alternative to Metro No. 2, which we were
    using before), but I'm looking for a serif face to go with Neutraface No. 2, not
    a different geometric sans serif to go with Minion. I know Neutraface No. 2 is
    popping up all over the place at the moment, but we're committed to it. Among
    other things, I need the condensed widths to make a squarer alternative logo for
    avatars and whatnot. Metro and Telefon both lack that.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Minion
    clash? Minion's narrowness is part of it, and maybe the subtle slope on the crossbar
    of the <em>e</em>, but I think it's mainly that Minion looks too '90s to me. I
    need something that's either less era-specific or equally \"now\" -- or maybe
    something reflective of the '20s/'30s era, when Neutraface's predecessors (such
    as Metro) were getting off the ground."

  body: Sorry for going off topic. Neutraface is indeed great, but quite expressive.
    I would suggest finding something "invisible" for a companion -- not something
    that will fight for its attention. Have you looked at other Slimbach faces? Arno
    and Kepler comes to mind.

    the Staunton pattern would have been replaced by the Man Ray pattern. But that\u2019s
    not the issue here.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/excelsior/excelsior/\">Excelsior</a>
    is a good match.\r\nAs a mid-century modern, it \uFB01ts the Neutraface style
    era.\r\nIt has good width and a smallish x-height, so will not look too big or
    narrow when used with Neutraface.\r\nAnd it has a sturdy somewhat slabby look,
    which could be considered contemporary with now.\r\n\r\nBTW, I hope you will use
    the multiply character in notation, rather than the letter x.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
