body: "Hello everybody!\r\n\r\nI have a quetsion about the price of fonts. I don't
  know exactly by how much price I sell one font with more of 100 glyphs to MyFonts...\r\n\r\nIf
  I sell a font with more of 100 glyphs to MyFonts, what is the price?\r\nIf I sell
  a font with more of 1000 glyphs to MyFonts, what is the price?\r\nIf I sell five
  fonts with more of 100 or 1000 glyphs to MyFonts, what are prices?\r\n\r\nSo I and
  my colleague intend to sell our own fonts to MyFonts, but we don't know exactly
  what the prices.\r\n\r\nI saw the fonts family PF Beau Sans Pro, MyFonts sells one
  font by 79 dollars while it sells a fonts family by 729 dollars. I imagine the Parachute
  foundry sold to it by very high price. \r\n\r\nKevin"

    Whether a typeface is an attractive design.\r\n2. How many OpenType features it
    has.\r\n3. How many languages it supports.\r\n4. How ornate it is.\r\n5. What
    its price is.\r\n6. What the EULA permits (e.g. number of terminals)."

  body: "The pricing will most instances be dictated by the market. And not by the
    number of glyphs.\r\n\r\nWhen an average text font (single) containing 490 glyphs
    (e.g. Latin and Greek, good coverage) would cost $49, that makes \xA210 per glyph.\r\nIf
    I adopt this formula to the Andron family (which has more than 13.000 glyphs)
    I end up at a single licence price of $1.300 \u2013 which no one would ever pay.\r\n\r\nThere
    seems no other way than to look at the prices competitive fonts are offered at.
    And to make a competitive pricing in that range."

  body: 'Price should also be based on utility; that is, how useful the font is to
    a wide range of uses. Most of my fonts are designed for headline use, and most
    have a specific "attitude," both of which limit their applications. Consequently,
    I don''t ask a lot for them. The low price doesn''t mean an inferior product:
    all the glyphs are hand-drawn (no autotracing, ever), hand-tweaked and hand-kerned
    for ALL possible letter combinations. Generally, what I lose in margin I gain
    in volume...'

  body: "ALL comments here are right. The basis of the prices is a equation between
    many informations. But, the mostly important stills the market feeling and, in
    my point of view I think the \"fame\" of the foundry or type designer is a important
    factor, too. If the \"Palimpsest\" project, by Freiberger, was made by a famous
    designer, sure which the font will be a higher price.\r\n\r\nSo, the \"Nick\"
    table can be this way\r\n\r\n1. Whether a typeface is an attractive design.\r\n2.
    How many OpenType features it has.\r\n3. How many languages it supports.\r\n4.
    How ornate it is.\r\n5. What its price is.\r\n6. What the EULA permits (e.g. number
    of terminals).\r\n7. Is the typeface own by a famous foundry?\r\n8. Similar fonts
    medium prices\r\n"

  body: Price can also be a marketing and branding tool. Some designs deliberately
    price high, offer very limited discounts, and only sell directly. This fosters
    an exclusive boutique brand that attracts fewer buyers, but more of them are high-end
    corporate buyers who outfit a lot of computers at once. On the other end, some
    people sell cheap and use free fonts and discounts to promote their work, which
    attracts lots of non-business users, students, and small businesses.
