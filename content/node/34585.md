  anyone point me to some digital typeface that look like this?  Preferably with an
  italic?"

  body: Thanks everyone!  Monster Mash and B-Movie are really close to what I want
    but I'm beginning to think I might have to custom-build some letters for this
    project.  I need something in the spirit of Turok but "happier".
