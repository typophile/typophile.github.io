  <BR> <BR>There was an eight page insert in one of this week&#39;s SF <BR>Chronicle
  editions that featured a typeface that looked like <BR>Font Bureau&#39;s Eagle &#40;geometric
  &#34;A&#34; with low crossbar&#41; but lighter, <BR>like Futura but with taller
  proportions and a &#34;t&#34; with a curved stem at the bottom like Gill Sans.  <BR>
  <BR>thanks in advance, <BR>Enrico

  body: That font on the web page you referenced looks like House&#39;s <a href="http://www.houseind.com/house.php?kit=NEUTRAFACE-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank">&#39;Neutraface&#39;</a>. All the chracteristics match, especially
    the large counters on the P and R. The a &amp; g have alternate forms, so I see
    nothing that isn&#39;t in that font.
