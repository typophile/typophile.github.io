  nothing came even close to it. This is probably from Germany in the 16th century

  body: "The graphic is linked to on http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/fontbooks.html\r\nIt
    is from a book from 1921 on book lettering. Get used to the fact that this is,
    as it says, 16th c. calligraphy. Mind the two e's in \"Sixteenth\". You won't
    find it as a font unless someone fonted it (which would include \"inventing\"
    all the caps except for S and C).\r\n\r\nJim Fordyce's Diamond Gothic (freeware)
    is similar, but wider. Manfred Klein's [[http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/14112|Dueres
    Minuskeln]] (according to Albrecht D\xFCrer) are similar too. Dieter Steffmann
    issued a \"Gothenburg Fraktur\" which seems to be a completed form of a \"Gothenburg\"
    font from the \"IMSI Masterfont collection\" (mostly clones and pirated fonts,
    Gothenburg seems to be cloned from - sorry, thought I'd seen it somewhere else
    but couldn't find it any more).\r\nAndreas"

  body: Sorry for the double thread, it's probably Ardenwood (the real version not
    the demo) as the text is basically the same except the swashes which look like
    cut/tweaked version of them.
