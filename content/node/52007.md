  body: "mike-\r\nfollowing your threads and googling \"OPTISport-Script\", \"Aktuelle\"
    and \"Spoleto\" i was still unable to find the font online for purchase or download.
    The closest i came to was this link: http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm ,  which claims
    it has the font for sale but doesn't register the font in my shopping cart. Do
    you know how/where I could acquire this font? I'm desperate! thanks so much for
    your help,\r\ndanny"

    and I would be willing to set some words in it for you, and send you a graphic.
    That's the best I can offer. You can e-mail me through my Typophile profile.\r\n\r\n-
