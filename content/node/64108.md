  body: "This is my last ID for you. (You've started <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/13207/track\">165
    ID requests</a> and didn't answer when I asked why you needed all of these) Your
    only involvement appears to be dumping your font identification work to others.\r\n\r\nI
    sure hope you aren't going through all of this to just recreate their logo because
    I found and pulled perfect vectors on this in about 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n\"Document

    Condensed  Bold Oblique</a>\r\n\r\nBased on a PDF of theirs I found loaded with
    Gotham I'm guessing \"IKON\" is modified <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100008\">Gotham
    Black</a>"

  body: "HI Friends\r\n\r\nThank you a lot for your help to everyone, especially to
    CreativeNRG for his help too, ID fonts is not a easy job, even so I learned through
    this forum to ID fonts too.\r\nWhy do I need id these fonts ? because nobody knows
    each font created, I need id font for my artworks, sometimes I need recreate a
    logo, sometimes i need remix some logos and sometimes i need to redo a logo.\r\nThat
    is the reason why I come back here to this forum, this forum is a great help to
    everyone whom need to id fonts.\r\nEven there are some chance to find vector logos
    on the net, I prefer to come back here to id these fonts.\r\n\r\nAgain thank you
    a lot my friends \r\n\r\nHernando\r\n\r\n\r\n"
