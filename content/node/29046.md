  the era of globalisation.'\r\n\r\nAt the moment I'm looking for different books
  and digital texts about the subject which is a bit hard to find. For the next meeting
  with my teacher I need to bring gather some visual source material that portray
  the growing interest for businesses to look further then the country boundries for
  their branding and advertising.\r\n\r\nI have been reading a lot on adbusters and
  some parts of books from google books, but I don't really know how to start looking
  for images, what keywords to use or what companies would be good examples.\r\n\r\nI
  kinda hoped that there would be some people around here that could help me out to
  get a start.\r\n\r\nYour help would be very much appreciated!!!\r\n\r\ndav2"

  body: You might want to look for books and articles which include anthropology as
    used in design and advertising. As society becomes more global, the need to understand
    what colors, words and symbols mean in different cultures becomes more important.
    One famous example is the Chevy Nova. to English speakers, a nova has to do with
    stars, but to a Spanish speaker, it means "doesn't go," which is a terrible name
    for a car. Large corporations have been taking this very seriously for several
    years now.

    terms of actually being read as \"no va\" -- but I'm not a Spanish speaker.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Nova#The_urban_legend\r\n\r\nThe
    Toyota MR2 was renamed for France however, according to my brother who's owned
    two, and now works for them.\r\n\r\nThe usual explanation is that it sounds like
    \"merde\". Wikipedia has \"When said in French, the name MR2 ... sounds like est
    merdeux ... (fr: is filthy). Thus, the car was sold there only as the MR.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MR2\r\n\r\n"

    from Adbusters, which I always find too extreme and whiny, you can revisit old
    Tibor Kalman issues of Colors Magazine.\r\n\r\nAs for companies: Coca-Cola."

    managers in global companies and you'll run into interesting everyday real-world
    issues - such as finding approriate matched corporate-fonts for different languages,
    problems with layout apps not supporting certain complex script languages, encoding
    issues, local subs doing their own thing, etc., etc.,\r\n\r\nCheers, Si    "

    to advance world wide). And to accomplish this most noble task I studied the concepts
    and techniques of branding.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm not yet 100% convinced - I think
    branding is old school. New school is to develope a <em>culture</em>, into which
    many different products can be presented.\r\n\r\nHere are two on-line articles
    which I hope will help your paper...\r\n\r\nThis first one is from Emigre 59:
    http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=26\r\n\r\nAnd this one is from a
    NY Times article that ran a while ago now. It's a great article on <em>culture</em>
    and <em>subculture</em>: http://www.murketing.com/journal/?p=119\r\n\r\n\r\nHiro\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    do! =)\r\nAlso just bought 'No Logo' by Naomi Klein which a friend of mine recomended
    which sounds quite interesting from the start.\r\n\r\nAs sii noticed that is also
    something I will need to read more on (type issues, colour issues, etc.). At the
    moment though I'm just asked to gather images to disect and to read about as a
    basis for the development towards the actual dissertation. But I do like to read
    and I will be having a couple of late nights reading all you guys posted since
    it will give me a better understanding of global branding.\r\n\r\nAgain thank
    you so much people! If I find any other recources I will also post them here on
    the forum, might anyone be interested then at least they will be able to find
    a lot about global branding on 1 page =)\r\n\r\nave,\r\ndav2"
