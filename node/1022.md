  had to adapt to both constraints -- duplexing &#40;AND UNITIZING&#41; for Lino,
  unitizing for Mono. So he made the choice to make the two &#39;a&#39;s fit the 9
  units &#40;which yields a noticeably wide roman &#39;a&#39;&#41; instead of cramping
  the italic in the 8-unit slot.&#34; <BR> <BR>........ <BR> <BR>Unless systems in

  body: Kent, nice experiment! <BR> <BR>&#62; If Sabon had been designed solely for
    Monotype, the roman &#39;a&#39; could have been put on 8 units <BR> <BR>My problem
    with that is I think the cramping of the 8-unit Italic &#34;a&#34; is so slight
    that making the Roman &#34;a&#34; so much better would have made more sense. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; If Sabon had been designed solely for Monotype, the roman &#39;a&#39;
    could have been put on 8 units, which would have given a more traditionally Garamondesque
    proportion; while the italic &#39;a&#39; could have been placed on 9 units, so
    as not to be too narrow. <BR> <BR>Conversely, if Sabon had been designed solely
    for Linotype &#40;with no Monotype issues&#41;, the two &#34;a&#34;s would have
    been duplexed, but to a more satisfying compromise width. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Hrant, <BR> <BR>I am not so sure about that. First we must understand the
    meaning of this. <BR> <BR>Mike Parkers words. <BR>..... <BR>&#34;The idea was
    to replace linotype operators with faster tape drives. In order to justify lines
    predictably, each character had to have a predictable width. Fairchild established
    a standard width for each character expressed in a single fixed set of eighteen
    units to the set width em to be used for all typefaces regardless of typeface
    design. The wider the column width, the larger the eighteen unit set width required.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>..... <BR> <BR>I read this to mean: Unlike Monotype where the units were
    based on the em of the type, The units in Linotype were simple a fixed formulae
    giving truth to predictability of column width regardless of type design. In otherwords
    the column width is more important than the type width. In any event, it appears
    to be quite cumbersome. And I predict your solution would not be quite that simple.

  body: <i>&#62;Do you mind if I insert &#40;AND UNITIZING&#41; and see if it meets
    with your approval.</i> <BR> <BR>Gerald -- <BR> <BR>Actually, I do not agree,
    in this instance. I think you are misinterpreting Mike&#39;s reference to TTS.
    The development of TTS machines led to the introduction of unitizing systems within
    the Linotype line, but these units were not subsequently applied to all projects.
    TTS was used only &#40;or at least predominantly&#41; in the transmission and
    setting of newspaper copy. TTS units would only have been used on faces intended
    for newspaper composition. <BR> <BR>This is my understanding, but you might double-check
    with Mike. I don&#39;t have his new number since he moved. <BR> <BR>Now, news
    faces were the large bulk of Linotype&#39;s bread and butter in the late 1950s
    and 1960s, as newspaper comp was the last bastion of Lino&#39;s market. &#40;Mike
    has said that Jackson Burke lamented that most of his tenure at the head of the
    MLCo. type department was spent forever revising faces for ever-narrowing newspaper
    columns.&#41;  <BR> <BR>But it was not the entirety of Lino&#39;s type output.
    Sabon would have been targeted toward the book composition market, and those houses
    would not have had TTS machines nor any need to conform to TTS standards. So I
    do not think it is reasonable to assume that Sabon needed to be designed to any
    unitized system on account of Linotype composition.  <BR> <BR>Sabon would have
    been developed while Mike was at the helm of the American MLCo. type dept., I
    believe. The face was cut by Stempel &#40;who were essentially German Linotype&#41;,
    but Mike might have some direct recollections. You could ask him. <BR> <BR>Hrant
    --  <BR> <BR>I do not know which size this digital Sabon &#40;Adobe&#39;s BTW&#41;
    would have been based upon. I would presume the 12 point, based on what I know
    of the general transition of designs from metal to photo to digital. But I can
    only assume.  <BR> <BR>You may be right and the decision about which unit width
    to assign the &#39;a&#39; to could have varied by size -- wider for the smaller
    sizes, narrower for display. On the other hand, I doubt that Tschichold would
    have made a different decision. Just a practical matter. Text would have been
    set primarily by machine comp; display would usually have been set by hand, I
    imagine. So all of the Lino and Mono sizes would probably all have the same wide
    &#39;a&#39;. I suppose that the foundry display sizes could have been cut without
    these restrictions, but I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t have information about what
    sizes were released in each medium. <BR> <BR>Clearly, you would have made a different
    decision under the same circumstances -- sacrificing the italic &#39;a&#39;. Tschichold
    made the other decision.  <BR> <BR>Obviously, Sabon was ripe for revision in digital
    without all the constraints, as aptly demonstrated by Jean-Fran

    poorly, trying to say. Thank you. <BR> <BR>I agree that the unit system had limitations,
    but it was an engineering puzzle, not a method of soliciting customer complaint.
    It was a challenge as you say, but for the most part, the engineers did a very
    fine job. <BR> <BR>Monotype houses were noted for typographical expertise or they
    would have purchased a lessor system. More skill was required in running Monotype
    Systems than Linotypes. Monotypes were the system of choice for both trade typographers
    and book houses. Not so often, run of the mill print shops or newspapers. There
    were many exceptions. <BR> <BR>Lanston used typographers and fine book printers
    as, &#34;Beta Testers&#34;. Bruce Rogers was amongst them. I can assure you, non
    were shy with comment, each trying to out do one another as a method of showing
    off their typographical finikitiness. &#40;Is that a word?&#41; And they didn&#39;t
    give a tinkers dam about punchcutters problems, or unit rows, they just wanted
    the typeface to pass their highest standards.  <BR> <BR>That was the primary goal
    of Lanston&#39;s punchcutting department. To satisfy production oriented owners
    and cranky artistic and very opinionated personalities. They did so, for the most
    part, very well. <BR> <BR>With &#34;multiple typesetting system planning&#34;
    the Sabon &#34;roman and italic a&#39; is not illustrative of English Monotypes
    finest capabilities, probably the same is true for Linotype. <BR> <BR>Criticism
    should be kept in perspective. This face is an exception, not a rule. This experiment
    in joint development was doomed to have &#34;some fall out&#34;. <BR> <BR>Characters
    of the alphabet in the Monotype System, were not out of necessity, &#34;too wide&#34;
    or &#34;too narrow&#34; or as some would suggest, never quite right. In most cases
    adjustments were made and the type designer would never see the difference. Either
    did the fussy customers after their complaints had vanished. I know the problem
    with the Sabon roman and italic &#34;a&#34; could have been minimized to the point
    this discussion would never take place. This is a grossly exaggerated example.  <BR>
    <BR>However the Linotype duplex problem is an efficiency that is bound to cause
    problems. <BR> <BR>But the secret to making  Sabon &#34;roman a&#34; and the italic

  body: <i>&#62;More interesting is the comparison with Linotype, with their TTS.
    </i> <BR> <BR>Just to clarify, TTS did not belong to Linotype. As I understand
    it, the TeleTypesetting System was an independent technology for transmitting
    wire stories to newspapers. Those publishers who subscribed to the service would
    receive stories via wire, which came out as punched tape. These tapes were then
    fed into the composing machine and produced typeset stories for the newspaper
    to publish. The device that interpreted the punched tape would be fitted to any
    of the various composing systems. Linotype was only one &#40;arguably the most
    common&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The point of the unitized standard for typefaces used with
    the TTS was that the stories would always run to the exact same characters per
    line and, consequently, an exact column length regardless of the layout of the
    paper -- specifically, regardless of the column width of the newspaper&#39;s grid.  <BR>
    <BR>Thus, a wire service could wait until the last possible hour to file a late-breaking
    story by indicating in advance that they would have the story run to X column
    inches and the papers could then continue to lay out their editions by holding
    open X inches of space for that story. This kind of just-in-time publishing depended
    upon reliable, consistent character counts, and column lengths. <BR> <BR>It had
    nothing to do with justification <i>per se.</i> <BR> <BR>The Linotype machine
    required no unit-system in order to achieve effortless justification. It employed
    a mechanical system that I think was ingenious, but I don&#39;t think I can describe
    it fully here. Basically, it employed wedge-shaped spacebands that adapted automatically
    to fill out the line. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR> <BR>

    the fonts used were self-spacing types. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s some research
    along different lines: <BR> <BR>Linn Boyd Benton took out his patent for a system
    of self-spacing type in 1883. The United States Type-Founders&#39; Association
    defined the American point system of type sizes in 1886. Notice that this article
    still cross-references the old, named body sizes.  <BR> <BR>Updike &#40;Vol. I
    pg. 34&#41; mentions that &#34;In 1894 a western firm introduced this system of
    self-spacing types, every type in their entire output being placed on a body the
    width of which was equal to an even division of the standard &#39;pica em.&#39;&#34;
    This term &#39;pica em&#39; was apparently soon replaced by the term &#39;point-set&#39;.
    Note that your article still refers to divisions of the Pica em. <BR> <BR>Given
    this, I am going to assert that this article dates from between 1886 and around
    1896, somewhere thereabouts.  <BR> <BR>The first typeface issued by &#40;American&#41;
    Lanston Monotype was in 1896 and it was for the Model C keyboard, which I believe
    was the arrangement that introduced the 18-unit system. I do not know if this
    configuration was utilized prior to that. <BR> <BR>Hrant, is this article specifically
    identified by Lawson &amp; Bidwell as an ATF piece? Updike does not name the &#34;western
    firm&#34; he refers to. I would have thought that if it was ATF, he would have
    simply said so. ATF was formed in 1892 and Benton, Waldo &amp; Co. was one of
    the original founders that merged into it. I can&#39;t imagine there was any other
    sizable foundry left after that to introduce such a system, especially given Benton&#39;s
    patent on the scheme. Yet, Updike says that every type was adapted to this system,
    which certainly does not describe ATF.  <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'Regarding unit systems: there seems to be some doubt in this forum as to
    its value. I do not suggest that posters are detractors, but there seems to be
    a bit of conjecture about its flexibility. Many are aware that when FW Goudy was
    presented with the task of designing his Goudy Gimbel &#40;38E&#41; for the Monotype
    system, he found it a long and difficult task, having never before been restricted
    to the width of his letters. You have to remember that Linotype and Montype were
    all there was for machine setting in those days. Neither were considered crude
    or archaic, rather they were thought of as amazing marvels of ultimate &#34;hi-tek&#34;
    engineering. They now seem to funny to most, but they were the result of a logical
    evolution from hand-setting to machine setting from recirculated cold types &#40;the
    Page machine&#41; to the very first Lino and Mono machines, which were even at
    that vastly different from the first successful operating versions of both.  <BR>
    <BR>It is understandable that FWG would find this restricting. He did, however
    deal with it, and the type was a great commercial success, as is evidenced by
    the fact that many matrix cases of it still survive. I don&#39;t find 38E to be
    the prettiest type ever done, but I don&#39;t see anything wrong with its set
    values or fit. I maintain that it is not terribly restrictive to work within assigned
    unit widths for a letter. The standard C, C1 and C2 arrangements accommodate a
    grteat many of Monotype&#39;s faces. This is due to none of them requiring unusually
    wide or narrow boundaries for an a or an e etc. What I am saying is that if a
    face is based on a kind of &#34;ideal&#34; set of proportions everything works
    out in the end. <BR> <BR>In the case of certain new releases it was not uncommon
    to allow the type designer to create an new set of unit row arrangement for the
    die case and it attendant keyboard stopbars and caster wedge. This is evidenced
    in Goudy&#39;s Kennerley Oldstyle, whcih uses not only its own keybar arrangement,
    but is also the first Monotype face to have an expanded system of 20 units. If
    you look through any jumbo Monotype speciman books you will come to an antire
    two page spread of noted Special Arrangements that expand on the standard 18 unit
    C arrangement. <BR> <BR>In setting Monotype the keyboard is constantly aware of
    units and the calculating of them. This is an absolute requirement in the setting
    of tabular work. In text work one is also constantly aware of unit counting in
    a much simpler way. <BR> <BR>I was not really aware that Liontype even worked
    on a unitizes system. What made this a revelation to me is that on the Linotype,
    the channels &#40;72 or 90 channels&#41; carrying the mats have a goodly space
    each side of the channels of mats, and I assumed that there was lots of latitude
    to widen or skinny up a character to some degree. This makes no reference to the
    problems of an italic and roman being on the same matrrix. So I learned something.
    <BR> <BR>In setting straight matter on the Linotype, a person is not required
    to count units, merely to keep an eye on the assembler so that when the measure
    is nearly filled he or she can decide how to fill out the line. As Kent Lew has
    noted the expanding spacebads do most of the work just like your computer does
    in setting justified&#41;. In some cases, thinspaces are dropped into the line
    of assemble mats by handl, for situations like small caps. For a few years I was
    a Linotype operator on dialies and weeklies and did a lot of typesetting. On the
    Linotype, tabular work was terribly difficult, if the shop did not carry the proper
    sets of tabular values fixed spaces. If this setting was an a narrow measure,
    there was little room for more than one spaceband, and it was tough going. The
    most awkward thing I ever had to set was track results for sulky racing. This
    had to fit in an 11 pica column, in a special very condensed 7 point condensed
    gothic whose name I cannot recall. This was so unusual that the racetrack promoter
    carried his own set of special Linotype mats that he presented to the weekly paper
    in each town that he travelled to for the season&#39;s racing, since he made his
    money on selling the race tout sheets. Sorry for the walk down Memory Lane. Old
    guys do that. <BR> <BR>What I suggest is that with Linotype and Monotype the unit
    system did not cause any typeface to be a failure because of the restrictions
    of width. I can&#39;t think of a face where an s or an a is pronouncedy too wide
    or too narrow, and I don&#39;t think it is because I am easly pleased. <BR>I am
    ignorant of the Sabon a too-wide problem, but my guess is that perhaps it was
    a conscious and decision by it designer. I don&#39;t think that is impossible,
    since humans do make some odd choices. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s Saturday morning and
    I have just spent the last five days cutting and recutting an 18 point letter

    -- the Linotype system &#40;metal&#41; <b>did not</b> require the type designer
    to work within fixed unit-widths. There were a few particular situations where
    a typeface would be unitized -- for reasons having nothing to do with the Linotype
    system <i>per se.</i> The foremost examples were TTS typefaces, for specialized
    newspaper setting, and special faces for setting tabular matter &#40;which, as
    Jim pointed out, was a real pain on the Linotype&#41;. <BR> <BR>Let me be clear,
    I do not think that Linotype was superior to Monotype because of the lack of a
    unitizing constraint. Nor do I think that Monotype was superior to Linotype because
    it lacked duplexing constaints. I think both were marvelous inventions and amazing
    examples of mechanical ingenuity. I think the type designers and letter draftsmen

    parabolic-looking compensation.</i> <BR> <BR>Hrant, I need to back up a minute
    and re-examine this with you.  <BR> <BR>You have said that Linotype&#39;s optical
    grading was linear. I presume you are saying this based on a sample graph that
    I posted to some other thread a while back, in which a few parameters appeared
    to be essentially linear. Correct me if I&#39;m mistaken. <BR> <BR>What parameters
    are you examining in ATF faces that lead you to the &#34;parabolic&#34; comment?
    <BR> <BR>The Linotype parameters that I presented were the few that I had data
    for immediately at hand &#40;from the Advance Proofs for Dwiggins&#39;s Falcon&#41;
    -- size of face &#40;i.e., measurement from top of ascender to bottom of descender&#41;,
    height of the capital H, and length of lowercase alphabet.   <BR> <BR>I am looking
    at the waterfall of ATF Garamond that you sent me. We can, of course, discount
    the first parameter, since the face on the body in any given design is practically
    guaranteed to be linear by point size. Since this sample you sent shows only lowercase,
    I cannot measure the cap H height. But I can -- and did -- measure the lowercase
    alphabet length. Here is my graph. &#40;Apologies for the large image.&#41; <BR>

    the x-axis is in a ratio of 10 points for every 1 point size increase; I did this
    so that it would be readable. Thus you can&#39;t infer anything necessarily from
    the angle of the line, but this doesn&#39;t affect its essential linearity. There
    does seem to be a shift in slope at the 14-point mark. We&#39;ve noted that there
    is a shift in the underlying master design at this point, so I&#39;m not surprised.  <BR>
    <BR>Aside from that, however, this data is essentially <b>linear</b>. Certainly
    no less so than the Falcon data &#40;which only ranged from 6 to 12 point, BTW&#41;.
    I do not see any parabolic compensation. At least not in set-width: character

    what I have, and maybe we can figure things out. <BR> <BR>First of all, though:
    You&#39;re right, some of what I said is pretty tentative - I&#39;m sorry if I
    jumped the gun. And some of my [provisional] conclusions are guided by what may
    be called &#34;quasi-scientific hunches&#34;. I&#39;ll try to explain that bit
    as I go along. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>My intentions in this process are to arrive
    at guidelines for digital type designers wishing to make different cuts of a given
    design optimized for different sizes. So what I&#39;m looking for is the set of
    deviations from some &#34;deliberative ideal&#34; that needs to be applied to
    a given size. The deviations are in width, color, letterspacing, vertical proportions
    and a bunch of other things. In my &#40;still-ongoing&#41; ATF Garamond analysis
    I&#39;m measuring 10 parameters, but all in relation to the largest size I have
    at hand, the 48. This means that my values are scalar. Below is some of the data,

    alt="ATF-G_length.gif"> <BR> <BR>Some observations: <BR>- There are two parts:
    6-14, and 18-48. <BR>- However, the 14 is suspicious &#40;see below&#41;, so the
    cutoff might in fact be between 12/14 instead. <BR>- The smaller-size section
    is not linear, it&#39;s curved. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s <i>quadratic</i>&#42;
    as opposed to cubic or something else &#40;and the data is probably too sparse
    and jumpy to ever know&#41;, but I gravitate to that because of three things:
    the next heuristically logical step after linear is quadratic; type is two-dimensional;
    and Luc[as] de Groot has found that weight gradation proceeds quadratically with
    respect to the horizontal scale. <BR>- The larger-size section looks mostly linear.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; I&#39;m now using this instead of &#34;parabolic&#34;. <BR> <BR>One
    big caveat: unlike the Centaur and Falcon specimens, my ATF Garamond stuff is
    &#34;unofficial&#34;: Mr Benton wasn&#39;t there to assure me that each size of
    what I used is the real stuff. Of the 11 sizes I used, two of them look suspicious:
    the 14, which is somewhat too narrow; and the 7, which is obviously too light.
    I&#39;m tempted to pull those out of my study, but there are some good reasons
    not to, and instead just give this caveat as needed. <BR> <BR>The other nine parameters
    I&#39;ve studied even less, but the ones dealing with width seem to behave in
    exactly the same way as above, while: <BR>- Vertical proportions also largely
    seem to follow the quadratic&#43;linear combination. <BR>- Weight seems to be
    one single quadratic curve. <BR>- Stroke contrast looks... hard to describe right
    now. <BR> <BR>To be fair, I guess if you applied this technique to Falcon you&#39;d
    get the same non-linear behavior! And as you say, your Falcon data &#40;which
    was indeed my source&#41; only spans the text sizes. <BR> <BR>So yes, it&#39;s
    too early to say with all confidence that ATF was better than Linotype at optical
    scaling. <i>On the other hand</i>, I&#39;ve seen a body of anecdotal evidence
    &#40;as well as just plain tangential observations&#41; that seem to indicate
    that the Bentons were in fact on another level. I&#39;ve revealed these to you
    in private recently, but if people here are interested I&#39;ll try to collect
    my thoughts enough for public delivery. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW: <BR>&#62; the

  body: Yes, Art Line refers to an alternative proportion of vertical space. It is
    used for designs that ATF wanted to allot more descender space for -- usually,
    of course, this is at the expense of some x-height, and thus the results look
    more bookish and &#34;elegant&#34;, like Garamond, Bodoni, Cloister. <BR> <BR>I
    presume that the point of declaring in the catalog that a face was cast on Art
    Line was to indicate to the customer that these fonts would not align &#40;baseline&#41;
    with their other fonts cast on standard Point Line.  <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, I
    would guess that there was a standard established for each size of Art Line that
    determined the placement of the baseline on the body. That is, I would expect
    all fonts of the same size, cast on Art Line, to align with each other. Is this
    not so, Jim? <BR> <BR>It is this standard aspect of the alignment that I believe
    Hrant is interested in.  <BR> <BR>I presume, Hrant, that it could be derived from
    samples.  I would guess that it follows similar principles to Point Line, but
    with different figures. As you will see if you examine the Point Line arrangement
    carefully, the purpose of the standard was to make it possible to place different
    sizes on the same line and align them by cutting appropriate point-size leads
    to make up the vertical differences. That&#39;s why the division of ascent/descent
    was established in whole points &#40;thus &#34;Point&#34; Line&#41;. <BR> <BR>But
    perhaps I am wrong, and Art Line did not accommodate mixed sizes on a line easily,
    in which case it may not be so simple to derive from examples. <BR> <BR>-- Kent.

    pica system. Its position had to be &#34;first found&#34;, then imposed. ATF inherited
    Caslon matrices with yet a different body system than the original Caslon foundry.
    I can not remember whether the Caslon Foundry based their transfer point and pica
    standard to mimic American Type Founders. I believe that is the case. I wish I
    had the source here or I would check. What I do know is that Lanston had their

    standard alignment of Art Line types as it is their anatomy, and it sort of makes
    sense that if two faces are both drawn to those paramters, they would match in
    base-alignment. However, I don&#39;t have castings of any two such types that
    I could proof together or put on an alignment gauge to test. So I wouldn&#39;t
    want to assume that they would mechanically align on the base. <BR> <BR>If I were
    going to pursue this line of research, I would first try to get actual cast letters
    of two differing faces done on the Art line. For my purposes of checking metal
    type alignment, I select a letter with the most emphatic baseline. Something flat
    like the cap or lowercase z works well. If the termination on the baseline of
    the z descends a little, I pay attention to the horizontal stroke which gives
    a good indication of the baseline. <BR> <BR>There is a man in Baltimore who own

    <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve said that, but now I&#39;ve been looking at this again and
    I don&#39;t see that it is. <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;ve shown convincingly that
    the alphabet length is essentially linear. Scaling the data to equivalencies to
    some master size doesn&#39;t really change the essential relationships of the
    lengths. There should be a set relationship between the linear graph and the scaled
    curve, and I don&#39;t think that relationship is a quadratic one. <BR> <BR>I
    went back to the alphabet lengths given by the ATF book and revised my formula.
    The text portion of the scale &#40;6, 8, 10, 12, and even 14&#41; can be expressed
    by y=7.83333x &#43; 40, where x is the point size and y is the alphabet length.
    &#40;The accuracy of this is within 0.33333 pts of the stated length for 8 and
    10, and 0.66667 pts for 14.&#41; <BR> <BR>If you assume a 12-point master drawing
    and scale everything to that, then the new curve &#40;which is shown in one of
    my graphs above&#41; can simply be expressed as y = 480/x &#43; 94, where x again
    equals the point size and y equals the alphabet length, scaled to 12-point equivalency.
    Again, the accuracy is within about a half a point. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not quadratic

    a debate that had become acrimonious, may be unfortunate, but I hope that facts
    will calm things down rather than inflame them. (I had encountered this thread
    as the result of a web search for the original unit system for TTS fonts.)\r\n\r\nThe
    history of the legibility faces from Linotype was, I thought, well known. Alexander
    Lawson's \"Anatomy of a Typeface\" gives a good account of it. First there was
    Ionic No. 5, with low-contrast strokes and a generous x-height. Then there was
    Excelsior, which was designed to address a problem of ink-trapping that was observed
    in one particular case.\r\n\r\nIn high-speed rotary stereotype presses, the rubber
    rollers that applied the ink had to be made of harder material so that they could
    withstand more friction. It was at this point that ink-trapping became a problem
    that had to be addressed in Excelsior's design.\r\n\r\nNot ink-trapping per se,
    but the need to apply ink more heavily so that halftone photographs would print
    properly, led to a flooding of counters with ink in tabloid newspapers: and so
    Paragon was designed.\r\n\r\nThen a different problem - mold shrinkage - led to
    the design of Corona.\r\n\r\nSo while ink trapping was a real phenomenon, it only
    played a role briefly, and this was basically because presses were being operated
    in a way that could be expected to lead to poor results."

    Linotype that their drawings of type were generally done to an 18-unit system
    or a 54-unit system, and that this became useful later on, when they came out
    with a phototypesetter that required this.\r\n\r\nThat came as a surprise to me,
    since indeed the Linotype mechanism makes no technical requirement for a unit
    system - since every space behaves like a quoin.\r\n\r\nBut this reminds me of
    something else. Given that the normal assortment of spaces and quads in a job
    case consists of em, en, 3-to-em, 4-to-em, and 5-to-em, plus the hairline space,
    and even the hairline space has a finite width, in my naivete, when first exposed
    to that I would have thought that even foundry type would have to be made to a
    unit system of 60 units to the em. If slugs of type had widths like pi/4 or sqrt(2)/2,
    they would drive typesetters to despair.\r\n\r\nThe favored explanation, though,
    was that the accuracy to which a line of type needed to be justified was finite,
    and just touching the sides of a slug would change its width due to one's sweat
    and the natural oils of one's skin and so on."

    that TIME magazine used TTS machines to operate Linotype casters during World
    War II because they needed to send identical copy to multiple printing plants.
    TIME, of course, was a magazine, not a newspaper, and I do not believe it was

    has become a general practice.\r\n\r\nI had thought that the multifont perforators
    were needed because even Corona wasn't designed with the same number of units
    per character as the TTS version of Ionic No. 5. That they could have been used
    to control Linotype machines setting magazines in Caledonia, however, appears
    not to be beyond the pale.\r\n\r\nOf course, this still wasn't an intrinsic limitation
    of Linotype. Presumably, if indeed this did happen, Linotype started unitizing
    its fonts sometime in the 1930s, when the advantages of using TTS for other purposes

    were cheaper, and you could have two (or more?) setters working on the TTS to
    feed one linesetter, optimizing the resource.

  body: "Exactly!\r\n\r\nOne of the original advantages of the Monotype system over
    Linotype was that the Monotype caster could be kept continuously busy, at an optimum
    speed, playing tapes generated on multiple Monotype keyboards.\r\n\r\nThe 18-unit
    system was a typographical disadvantage intrinsic to Monotype which Linotype did
    not share. On the other hand, Linotype had the disadvantage that Roman and Italic
    were normally identical in width (but bold was on separate matrices, and small
    caps were put in their own locations), and this was more noticeable.\r\n\r\nWhen
    the TTS system was introduced for newspapers, it was noted that it allowed a Linotype
    machine to run more quickly and smoothly than one operated manually.\r\n\r\nSo,
    given that someone who used to work at Monotype noted that they were designing
    their fonts to an 18-unit system, what I think may have happened is the following:\r\n\r\nOriginally,
    when Linotype was first designed, what you see in the advertisements and the standard
    textbooks was right. Monotype had the unit system, Linotype had Roman and Italic
    equal in width.\r\n\r\nAfter TTS was introduced, and people saw the *additional*
    benefit of how efficiently it made Linotype machines run, popular demand led to:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the
    creation of the \"multifont keyboard\" which could be set up to punch tapes based
    on different unit values for the letters than those standardized for the newspaper
    fonts, <em>and</em>\r\n<li>Linotype making their matrices for fonts other than
    the newspaper legibility faces to an 18-unit system, so that those fonts would
    be usable with TTS.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSo even where paperbacks or magazines, instead
    of newspapers, were being set on Linotype, the machines could still be used as
    efficiently as Monotype casters, thanks to TTS being universally applicable."

    legibility faces to an 18-unit system, so that those fonts would be usable with
    TTS. </cite>\r\n\r\nI think that you may be drawing a conclusion that is not completely
    warranted. \r\n\r\nAFAIK, the Teletypesetter system of tape-driven composition
    did not intrinsically require unitized fonts. \r\n\r\nThe TTS system was, foremost,
    a standardized encoding system for tape perforation that facilitated long-distance
    [telegraph] transmission of keyed text. \r\n\r\nIndeed, a side benefit is that
    this allowed tape-driven composition on an suitably equipped Linotype machine,
    similar to the benefit seen on a Monotype.\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe that unitization
    is a separate issue. \r\n\r\nThe 18-unit system was an integral part of the Monotype
    matrix setup and its justification procedure. A unitized system allowed progressive
    calculation of the composed line and simplified the mechanical computation of
    space adjustment for justification. \r\n\r\nThe Linotype, on the other hand, relied
    upon a physical mechanism for line justification -- the tapered spaceband. So,
    unitization would not have benefited this process.\r\n\r\nI have always understood
    that the purpose of a unitization spec as part of the TTS system was for standardization
    in newspaper syndication. Part of the original impetus for the development of
    TTS was a more efficient means of transmitting news stories. The addition of unitization
    standards would have allowed a story to set to a consistent measure and length
    in different newspapers with different body types.\r\n\r\nThis standardization
    would not have benefited book compositors. \r\n\r\nAs I understand it, the whole
    point of development of the Multiface Perforator was to work with non-unitized
    fonts and thus a different \"counting\" mechanism for engaging other operator
    functions.\r\n\r\nWhat I do know for a fact, having spent some time analyzing
    the production drawings of Caledonia (drawn in 1937, well after the introduction
    of the TTS system), is that this book face was *not* drawn on an 18-unit system.
    Although I have not analyzed other designs as closely, I am highly skeptical that
    any other book faces were unitized either, prior to the introduction of Linotype's
    own unitized phototypesetting systems."

  body: "I have just found out some additional information relvant to the question
    of whether or not Linotype fonts, needlessly from the standpoint of the Linotype
    mechanism, were unitized due to some external cause.\r\n\r\nIn the book \"The
    Lithographer's Manual\", I found that the Fairchild Multifont perforator was intended
    to allow Linotype machines to be operated through TTS to set fonts other than
    the newspaper legibility faces. However, this was achieved not just by allowing
    the character widths to be adjusted, but also by changing the unit system from
    18 to the em to 32 to the em.\r\n\r\nThere was a posting on the Typophile forums
    where someone who worked at Linotype remembered they were drawing fonts there
    to an 18-unit system and then a 54-unit system, at least so that these fonts would
    be usable with their forthcoming phototypesetter products. No one remembers Linotype
    designing fonts to a 32-unit system.\r\n\r\nThe TTS system did have to calculate
    where each line would end. So the existing fonts, not recut, would have to be
    measured, and their widths - possibly rounded down, rather than up, so that errors
    would lead to excessively loose spacing, and never less-than-zero spacing - set
    on the TTS perforator.\r\n\r\nSo, basically, this confirms your statement: fonts
    didn't get cut to a unit system at Linotype in the '30s because of TTS; this only
    happened much later, when phototypesetting systems other than the imitation hot
    metal Fotosetter were on the horizon."

    the context of looking up information about Linotype legibility faces, led me
    to look at the Presswire faces for the Selectric Composer. Those faces had narrower
    numerals... so I thought I would check how well the narrower size matched the
    numerals used with TTS.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the Presswire faces reduced the
    width of the numerals to 4 units (from the normal 6) in the Composer 9-unit system;
    but had they been reduced less severely, to 5 units, they would have been a closer
    match to the 9 unit numerals in the teletypesetter system.\r\n\r\n@kentlew:\r\n<cite>Nevertheless,
    I would guess that there was a standard established for each size of Art Line
    that determined the placement of the baseline on the body. That is, I would expect
    all fonts of the same size, cast on Art Line, to align with each other. Is this
    not so, Jim?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe system of lining used by ATF, and by other typefounders
    of that era as well, generally involved three standards.\r\n\r\nThere was the
    normal line (ATF: American line; Barnhart: Uniform line; Inland: Standard line),
    which allowed about 1/5 of the type body for descenders.\r\n\r\nThere was the
    Script or Art line (ATF: Art line; Barnhart: Text line; Inland: Script line),
    for authentic old style faces and script faces, which allowed about 1/3 of the
    type body for descenders.\r\n\r\nAnd there was also a Titling line (ATF, Inland:
    Title line; Barnhart: Cap line) which allowed only a minimal area on the type
    body below the baseline.\r\n\r\nWhere necessary, increments of 1/2 point or even
    1/4 point were used - for the very small type sizes, but the preference was for
    every size of type, in all three \"lines\", to have a distance from the baseline
    to the bottom of the type slug that differed from the distance from the baseline
    to the bottom of the type slug for every other size and style of type by a whole
    number of points.\r\n\r\nSo, using only standard leading material, in single points
    or half points where needed (and 1/4 point only in the extreme case of type at
    6 points or less), one could align the baselines of any face with any other, even
    if one was Art line and the other Standard line, and whatever their point sizes
    might be. That was why they called it 'lining' type.\r\n\r\nIn the Didot system,
    Bauer, and probably others, did much the same thing. The baseline might be 1.4
    Didones above the bottom of the type body for one size of type, and 2.9 Didones
    above it for another; what counted was that the difference was 1.5 Didones, a
    multiple of half of a Didot point."
