  for Portuguese/Portuguese comunity Indie Font Developers. Already bought the URL,
  TYPENATION.com, and I wanted to ask you typophiles what are the legal/comercial
  aspects I have to start with. \r\n\r\nFor instance, is the fonts licence issues
  a foundry responsability? On myfonts.com what is the process to add up the foundry
  on the list?\r\n\r\nAny help on these issues/warnings is welcome.\r\n\r\nJim, from
  unionfonts.com or Grant from Veer.com, any help would be appeciated :) \r\n\r\nthanks."

  body: "The issue of font licensing varies. Agfa-Monotype (now Monotype Imaging)
    distributes all of the fonts at its website under their own license; MyFonts.com
    distributes all of the fonts at its website under the issuing foundry's license.
    The important matter to consider here is that, when you \"sell a font,\" you are
    not actually selling a piece of software, but only a license to use that software.\r\n\r\nThe
    advantage Monotype gains from their practice is that, since they are selling their
    own licenses, they can determine the selling price (and collect a heftier commission).
    MyFonts.com merely serves as a sales agent, and collects a smaller commission.\r\n\r\nWithout
    going into details, let me say that, personally, I do not intend to renew my distribution
    agreement with Monotype when its current term expires, but will continue with
    MyFonts.com as long as they'll have me."

  body: "Thanks Oldnick. So basically I want to distribute fonts, and the designer
    make their prices just like Myfonts. And this way I can add my foundry on myfonts
    under the same conditions.\r\n\r\nAnything important to add/think?"

  body: Liability laws differ from country to country, but it would me a good idea
    in your distribution agreement to have a clause that shields you from indemnity
    in the event that one of the foundries that you represent is sued.
