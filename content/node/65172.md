body: "Hello, everyone!\r\n\r\nMy work will actually get printed for real for the
  very first time and your feedback would be so much appreciated. THIS IS A FAVOR
  TO A FRIEND AND I ONLY HAD ONE DAY TO WORK ON IT. I had numerous versions, but this
  is the one that we came to agree to like the most.\r\n\r\nThis is the  front of
  an invitation, but I have two versions in a pdf file put as a spread just so that
  you could compare the subtle differences (in placing of the information and typographic
  details). The theme of the exhibit is Dec14th of 2009 (it will feature the work
  of both the photographer as well as the fashion designer).\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If that large number is the date, then that's far off in the future! :->\r\n(If
    not, it's confusing.)\r\n\r\nOther than that: Cool, clean, neat. The type treatment
    seems to go very nicely with the image I think. \r\n\r\nI *think* I'd prefer the
    right hand version, but it's hard to tell like this. Can you maybe put a border
    around the actual page size?\r\n(In any case, the \"&raquo;\" arrows/guillemets
    are better with a space after them.)\r\n\r\nOh, and I don't know how it is in
    other languages, but you might want to put at least a thin space after the periods
    in the date, on the right side.\r\n\r\nEDIT/PS: It would probably have been better
    to post this in the Critique -> Typography section, for the next time :)"

  body: "\r\nThaks so much Altaira for a feedback!! I will post this in the Critique
    now. Sorry I had no idea. :-(\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway; the large numer is the date far
    off in the future. That is the theme of the exhibit and to have it set like that
    was meant to be misterious/confusing/undefinied and explained better in the rest
    of the photography from the series and/ or when the exhibit takes place.\r\n\r\nI
    will fix heh space after the periods in the date!\r\nTHANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
    YOU!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ad augusta per angusta.\"\r\n"
