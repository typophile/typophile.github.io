  body: "Not Avant Garde. None of the various published versions of Avant Garde have
    a closed R at this weight. However, Mostardesign has recently published Sofia,
    a family by Olivier Gourvat which, on first look, seems to be a revival of Avant
    Garde with certain characteristic changes; for example, the Sofia R has a closed
    counter throughout. Comparing PREMATURELY PLASTIC in Sofia Extralight or Thin
    appears to match your sample here.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/sofia/\r\n\r\n-NJ"

    more closed. Victoria, can you provide a bigger sample?"

    Avant Garde with a closed R."

  body: "I did those Avant Garde variations for W Magazine. \r\n\r\nFollowing the
    AD's direction some glyphs were redesigned, the lowercase was re-proportioned,
    additional weights were added and all of those old uppercase ligatures were redesigned.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "There IS a gap in the line up of available AvantGarde-like geometric sanses:
    I just did an Identity Programme where the client wanted something like AG with
    some Century Gothic sensiblities. I ended up adapting a Chalet-version -- thickening
    it, new t, new ij diphtong, and a lot of other fiddling around. For 14 glyphs\u2026"
