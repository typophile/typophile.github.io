  it would be much appreciated. This is for the Sailor Jerry Rum, not just sailor
  Jerry tattoo fonts. I'm hoping this was a font and not a custom design for the rum.\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much!"

  body: Bummer. Thanks though. Do you know of any fonts relatively similar to it?
    Maybe a few and I can piece something together? Thanks riccard0.
