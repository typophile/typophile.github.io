  Gesta.\r\nI wanted to show this here before closing it, and hear any suggestion
  you might have.\r\n\r\nIs there something you feel it is awkward or not working,
  or something you might do differently?\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced. And a great 2009:)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img_gesta_3460.jpg]"

  body: "I like it. I don't see anything that looks awkward right now. \r\nYou might
    think about making a second g, a double-story one. I think such a g would work
    well with the squarish style of the design."

  body: Thanks Jelmar, I think a double-story g might look good on this. I think I
    will try that.

  body: "I like it as well. Looks like a lot of the contemporary square sans serifs,
    but looks good.\r\nI'd try the 2nd g, but I'd be afraid that it would be distracting
    and disjointed from the rest of the forms.\r\n\r\nNit-pickin': the bottom of the
    a feels a little awkward. I see what your doing by making the bowl hang a little,
    but it's distracting me. Perhaps it needs to stay thinner a little further. Same
    kind of thing happening with the b (you notice it most in the bold).\r\n\r\nThe
    placement of the accent on the \xE1 feels like it's placed a little weird.\r\n\r\nKerning
    on the o seems a hair wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Paul, I think see what mean. You think the round base on a and b are too
    heavy? I think I see that on the regular and the heavier weights. Would you say
    the same about the light weight?\r\n"

  body: "On the <strong>a</strong> and <strong>d</strong>, I think the bottom triangle
    bit could be opened up a bit more. Maybe make the bottom curve more like that
    of the <strong>u</strong>, which has more room. The <strong>g/q</strong> seem
    to have the same curve as the <strong>a/d</strong>, maybe those can use the <strong>u</strong>
    curve as well. Especially in Medium/Bold. Exactly the same goes for the italics.
    (Am I referring to the same as Paul?)\r\n\r\nI like your <strong>k</strong>'s,
    with the little straight bit. I wonder, though, what it would look like if this
    little detail would be flipped horizontally. I.e. if the little straight bit would
    be on the top arm. But for the rest leaving the arms themselves intact. Maybe
    it looks crap, but just wondering. :)"

  body: It looks nice on the guillemets, but I think the rounding of lessthan and
    greaterthan may prove impractical.

  body: "Thanks, your suggestions on the curves were very helpful I'm already working
    on them, and they are Improving.\r\nthey implied some other adjustments but I'll
    show them later.\r\n\r\nKevin, I agree, the less and greater were already on my
    ToDo list.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like this. These monoline ones must be very tricky to achieve. It's very
    neat and precise without being sterile or cold. I like the curves and the knee
    of the K and k and the numerals.\r\n\r\nI know it's very subjective but I think
    your dieresis and tilde seem to float a bit high when top-aligned with the circumflex,
    acute and grave. I think I'd pull them down to centre-align with those.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure about the comma and quotes. The shapes could be simpler, somewhere between
    straight and curved, with the tail thicker. The square head seems too aggressive
    to me. Just because I'm working on those glyphs in my own font at present, I'm
    paying extra attention to how they're constructed.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I really like
    it."

  body: "I agree with many of the above comments. I noticed some misspellings/typos
    in your sample that you may want to fix, too (shown here in CAPS):\r\n\r\n\"This
    page shows it working in text compositions at various sizes. G\x10esta is friendly
    and CHARISMATIC with ITS generous\r\nx-height and slightly curved strokes. This
    new Sans is AVAILABLE in four weights from light to bold with four matching italics.
    It is intended for CORPORATE and editorial PURPOSES & it is EQUIPPED with S\bmall
    Caps for every weight and also old style figures.\""

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nHere is how it turned out.\r\n\r\nI fixed the curves on the
    bottom of a, b, d, p, q and made them closer to the curve on the u. This turned
    into a big improvement i think, especially in the heavier weights.\r\n\r\nAlso
    remade the comma and quotes, the less and greater, and the tild and dierensid
    position.\r\nI left out the to storied g, because I think it would be to complicated
    for this font.\r\n\r\nI think it has improved a lot, thanks to your comments.\r\n\r\nI
    also uploaded a new Pdf file on top.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/notebook_5893.jpg]"
