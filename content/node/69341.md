  body: "Oh, I see what you're talking about.\r\n\r\nMyfonts says:\r\n- Designers:
    Stuart Brown\r\n- Publisher: HamburgerFonts\r\n\r\nFontshop says:\r\n- Designed
    by Identikal\r\n- Published by Identikal\r\n\r\nTo answer your question, the designer
    is indeed Stuart Brown, just as Jean Paul says, but it's first published by the
    Identikal Type Foundry.\r\n"

    Brown is the designer and he first went to IDK. I think there was a mistake when
    they published their Fonts at Fontshop.com.\r\nHamburgerfonts on Myfonts.com seems
    to be just Stuart Brown."
