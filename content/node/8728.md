body: 'ok, here&#39;s my question of the day: <BR>which is better-- <BR>1&#41; to
  design diacritics that allow oacute and o with kreska to be represented by the same
  glyph. bascially in this scenario one would need to design fairly steep accents
  &#40;acute and grave&#41;, correct? How acceptable are these steeper accents in
  other languages that use diacritics? <BR>2&#41; to use the OpenType locl feature
  to make this replacement. I&#39;ve heard that no apps currently support language
  sensitive replacements so this may not be very well implemented at the present.
  <BR>So which would be the preferred method to resolve this problem? <BR>Also, has
  unicode recognized the difference between the acute accent and the kreska? <BR>Any
  light you could shed would be appreciated... thnx.'

  body: 'In my experience, most language users are happy with a fairly steep acute
    accent, which will serve as a kreska. The exception is actually the preference
    for quite flat accents in Czech and Slovak, so if anything these are the languages
    that I would address using the <i>locl</i> feature. <BR> <BR>Unicode does not
    distinguish between the kreska and the acute accent: they are the same character.'
