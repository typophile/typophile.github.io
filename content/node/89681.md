  suggestions for Depression era typefaces (late 1920s to mid 1930s) that I can use
  for a website. I've read that Futura and Gotham were commonly used during the Depression.
  But I'm probably missing out on some other great original or revival typefaces from
  that era.  Thanks so much for your help!\r\n\r\nNick "

    read more accurate sources.\r\n\r\nIf you want to discover what was *common* in
    an era -- well, beginning of the 20th Century & later -- look at the magazines
    of the time. Before that, newspapers. Available in most libraries. IIRC, <cite>Life</cite>
    used Bodoni for text..."

    know. I'm just puzzled why anyone would think Gotham was used during the depression.
    Futura looks \"retro modern\" while Gotham looks genuinely modern."

    vernacular gothics in American signage. These (including the Port Authority Bus
    Terminal signs that were the most direct inspiration) were often all in caps.
    To my eyes the lowercase letters added to make Gotham look quite contemporary.
    So I'd say it's legit to use Gotham if trying to evoke the Depression, but it
    would be more persuasively done in all-cap settings.\r\n\r\nIt's like saying Bembo
    was used in the Renaissance: completely wrong, but not completely unhelpful."
