body: "<a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/poll/?x=1686\">Fast Company</a> asks <em>\"What
  Motivates You?\"</em>Love or Fear?\r\n\r\nWhat a bizarre question. I mean it makes
  <em>complete</em> sense, but how can you choose? I certainly can't. I'll admit that
  fear is part of my life. But I figure it is part of everyone's, isn't it? \r\n\r\n:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\r\n\r\nWhile
  I have been known to enjoy vampires...<em>I have no idea why</em>...and the occasional
  whomp on the bad guys movie...<em>especially when it is girls doing the whomping,
  think Lara Croft, Hero, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Charlie's Angels, Hero, Kill
  Bill</em>...I don't enjoy gratuitous violence. That said, there is something about
  <a href=\"http://happytreefriends.atomfilms.com/index.html\">Happy Tree Friends</a>
  that makes me laugh so hard it is dangerous to be drinking water at the same time.
  If you are anti-violence of the cartoon-cute-and-cuddly kind, you probably won't
  enjoy this.\r\n\r\n:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\r\n\r\nDoes metaphor exist in
  interactive design? A very <a href=\"http://www.odannyboy.com/blog/cmu/new_archives/the_role_of_metaphor_in_interaction_design.html\">interesting

  body: "Very true, Dan. And it also depends upon the situation. I like to think I
    act out of love--of work, of design, of client, of boss, of family--more than
    fear. Why is that? \r\n\r\n:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\xB7:\r\n\r\nFor those of
