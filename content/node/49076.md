  a site redesign and I am looking for a font which\r\nI could use for headlines.
  Ideally, this font would look like the big display sister to Unibody 8 Italic.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks Stephen! I had looked at Odile before, but found it too fragile. Bree
    might work better.
