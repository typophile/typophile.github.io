body: Is there any reason what so ever to think of including the glyphs in the extended
  greek Unicode bloc in a Monospace? I ask this in absolute naivete. Also, What is
  the extened set for? Is it for regionally used glyphs or is it for ancient greek?
  Or something else?

    mind, what mono ( or group of them ) do you think has done the best job/s of compromising
    between meeting the optical needs of a mono and the cultural imperatives of Greek?
    \r\n\r\nMy of the top of the head guess is that you might say Consolas. Did Luc(as)
    include greek in his other Monos? "

  body: 'And Nick, Guilty as charged - mostly. I don''t pretend to be making the best
    Mono. My mania is not that far advanced yet. But I am interested in it being very
    useful and reasonably complete. Plus it''s a great excuse to learn about the Greek
    forms! '

  body: "<em>What is the extened set for?</em>\r\n\r\nMost of it is for Greek polytonic.
    Monotonic and polytonic are two different orthographies for the Greek language,
    monotonic being the \"modern\" one.\r\n\r\nA monospace to include polytonic? <a

    Elementa Greek Polytonic</a> comes to my mind."
