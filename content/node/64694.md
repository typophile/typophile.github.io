  feedback or recommendations you have on finding a similar font to the attached script.
  \ I'm a stationery designer and the script face on these wedding invitations looks
  to be hand-calligraphed (that said, if you recognise it, please step forward!) but
  if someone knows of a similar font I would be truly grateful.\r\n\r\nI regularly
  scour both Veer and Sudtipos and have a pretty big collection of their calligraphy
  fonts from Charles Bluemlein and Ale Paul, but I'm yet to see anything quite right.
  \ Does anyone know of a script that is both curly and whimsical, but still a little
  retro casual at the same time?\r\n\r\nThoughts, anyone?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Script

  body: I would maybe send Ale Paul an email suggesting something along these lines,
    because I'm sure there are tons of other people out there who would like something
    similar.
