body: Heres a project i have been working on. I want to come up with three strong
  comps for the client.  I already favor one but wanted to get your imput.   <BR>
  <BR>Quantum is a little different than most construction company&#39;s.  They are
  experienced in German Craftmanship and use ecological building techniques.&#40;not
  on every job&#41; <BR> <BR>Regardless heres what I have so far. I could play with
  the square for days. I havent picked a font and the client said he is willing to
  purchase any that would fit right so any suggestion are helpful. I just layed it
  out in frutiger to make the most legible type for now.  I put construction smaller
  because it just seemd to work better that way, since its in all caps i spaced out
  the lettering to make it more legible.  <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53513.gif"

    the square is prefab, maybe if I round the corners it would help?'

  body: It could be read as pre-fab but it sure is nice looking. &#34;Green house&#34;
    was nice as well. How about trying a Q with a house shape as it&#39;s counter?
    Could be too cheesy but worth a try.

  body: thanks for your imput. I will try the q idea. <BR> <BR>since qc is repeated
    within  the square and in some way it can look like a timber frame which quatum
    construction builds a lot of.  <BR>I will try your suggeestion and post back later.

  body: Gregory, ask yourself this question. Is the word Construction as important
    as the name Quantum? If not make it alot smaller and tuck it under Quantum. <BR>
    <BR>On the mark try making the black area in perspective. Move the point of the
    lower left of the black in towards the center. Move the point of the lower right
    towards the center, just a little.

  body: I think I like your bottom-right design in post 34 better than these later
    posts. The 3-D effect is distracting from the &#34;Q-C&#34; combo that creates
    the mark. <BR> <BR>As Daniel described, tuck that &#34;Construction&#34; underneath
    &#34;Quantum&#34; as you did in earlier posts. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: Gregory, why is all the type so heavy? The only type I would make that bold
    is Quantum. Construction is far too important and because everything is bold nothing
    stands out. The forced justifcation isn&#39;t working the gap between the License#
    and the number is terrible. Also you forgot the zip code. The gaps in the other
    lines aren&#39;t much better. Make the type flush left, rag right, use a lighter
    weight on the information and fix the spacing. I would also look at a different
    face for the clients name, its too imposing. Sorry, but thats how I see it. Its
    not a reflection on you or your talent.

  body: Gregory, much better, more approchable. I would investigate using the brown
    or a green as an accent only and the main color in a steel gray or a granite gray.

    Are they in illustrator swatches? <BR> <BR>heres another logo variation, its actually
    doesnt compete with the name as much<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/55046.gif"

  body: Gregory, just open the PMS swatches in the program you are using, but even
    better would be to go to an art store and buy a PMS swatch book. They are expensive
    but worth it.  <BR>The terms Steel gray and Granite gray are just directions not
    specific colors. <BR>Did you investigate a horitonzal version of the business
    card? Also think about embossing the mark. It could be a tinted emboss it would
    screem construction without saying a thing.

  body: I don&#39;t like the crosshatch line. I know it&#39;s a carry-over from previous
    ideas, but doesn&#39;t seem to be applicable to the last logo direction. It&#39;s
    competing with the logo.

  body: It looks like I&#39;m in the minority but I&#39;m not wild for the rubik&#39;s
    cube/electric plugs logo mark. As others mentioned it seems to convey pre-fab
    more than quality construction. And the QC connection in the mark is strongest
    where the leters interlock which also looks confusing because then one of the
    letters is on it&#39;s side. Not until I started typing this did I see the right
    reading QC relationship. But because one&#39;s eye is drawn to the tension of
    the interlock, it&#39;s harder to see the QC next to each other. &#40;I hope I
    explained that clearly.&#41; <BR> <BR>Since you are planning on showing three
    concepts to your client, I suggest re-visiting your first logo. I liked the simplicity
    of the form &#40;but not the rounded font you selected&#41; and the centers made
    me think of screwdrivers. Which in turn makes me think of fine hand craftsmanship.
    In reality hand tools are probably so infrequently used in construction these
    days but I think the symbolism is timeless. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m attaching a down
    and dirty sketch. My thoughts were that the mark should look built and organic
    at the same time. My version may have too much of a ying/yang feel to convey German
    Craftsmanship. I just wanted to illustrate that your initial sketch has other
    possibilities. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/55112.jpg"
    alt="QC logo test"> <BR> <BR>I also like the basketweave line that you incorporated
    onto the business card, but I don&#39;t like it with the cube logo. Perhaps it
    should be used on it&#39;s own with a clean type treatment. <BR> <BR>Keep posting.

  body: HI guys! <BR>im in the &#34;Cube logo fun club&#34; <BR>no 3D - that loosens
    its very strong visual power. &#40;well.. to me.&#41; <BR> <BR>and the house in
    green made of bamboo, is not german or precise craftman like to me. <BR> <BR>and
    the first QC version gives me the idea of &#40;&#43;&#41; and &#40;-&#41; signs,
    which is like this next to eachother are like battery rechargers signs... nahhh....  <BR>
    <BR>but the blocky one is wonderful. house blocks attached 2 eachoder - veryproper.
    dont mess up the good concept with too much lines. &#40;including 3D, or strong
    outline or so...&#41; simply use some green in the first version... &#40;i liked
    that a lot&#41; <BR> <BR>but just to show u that u r confusing, Post nr 43 is
    very nice suprice as well.. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'hey all thanks for the suggestions.  <BR> <BR>Daniel i like the way you think.
    An emboss would be awesome. It would give the card a three dimensional feel.  <BR>
    <BR>Do you know any homemade techniques to do this?  I would like to test if first
    to see if it works for the project? <BR> <BR> I went to Kelley Paper picked out
    some stock and  printed some stuff and I will post them.  This process has been
    fun. <BR> <BR>Kristen:  I agree I think that I could explore older options. Iam
    open to anything new. I like your exploration of the logo.'

  body: Gregory, there is only one way to simulate the emboss that is to pain stakinly
    cut a piece of the same paper and paste it on a flat piece of stock. I&#39;ve
    done it before myself. It takes time but is worth it.
