  body: "I suppose the first question should be whether the client would be happy
    to see their activities reduced to a very basic interpretation. \r\nIf the answer
    is yes then the weight of the strokes of the observer and star might be better
    if they were equal and the arm might benefit from being more geometric like the
    star and head. As you have chosen Futura Condensed the bar of the A formed by
    the arm is rather high. There is a shape formed by the inside of the top bowl
    of the S that could be used as a left shoulder that might be worth exploiting.
    The telescope doesn't immediately reveal itself, the tapered/irregular shape could
    be a megaphone, maybe a more conventional telescope, a series of rectangles perhaps.
    Have you looked at having the objects filled rather than stroked, at least in
    the colour version it might be too much in the black version, the head looks too
    close to the S. \r\nFor the type I would look at having equal tracking throughout
    and centred, maybe tighter tracking and larger point size or as a single line,
    the looser tracking of the second line is too light and the alignment of the I,
    L and E will be difficult to bring off.\r\nTim"

  body: "Echoing what Tim said: It's a bit too ambiguous for me right now. I have
    a hard time picking it apart visually and mentally. The forms aren't distinct
    enough for me yet, but I like the direction. Maybe avoid outlined shapes and make
    the telescope mildly less abstract.\r\n\r\nNormally I'd never say this, but the
    shapes of the mark and the type might be too integrated. Mainly it's the circle,
    which I assume is a head. It's too much like a letter to me, but not enough like
    the type, so my mind's eye keeps trying to resolve it, like an optical illusion
    that flickers between two interpretations. Find a balance between contrasting
    the shapes and the type and integrating them. Also, the star is a bit close to
    the telescope. My wife commented that it read like a cannon for her, rather than
    a telecsope, at first glance.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it looks like you've got a strong
    concept in mind and a clear sense of the aesthetics. Keep refining, and it'll
    be really sharp."

  body: "What type of research is done at SARI? I ask because not all  professional
    astronomy is visual observation. Where is the facility located? Is it named for
    Harlow Shapely? \r\n\r\nIf this will be reduced for letterhead, the two lines
    of text will be very small, and the different letterspacing of each line might
    be distracting. I\r\n\r\nMost observatories don't really have logos, so this is
    cool. "

  body: It's WAY too literal, and the telescope actually distracts from legibility.
    Also, consider more contrast between "SARI" and the words below. Think about simplifying
    the telescope concept visually, and possibly trying to integrate the scope directly
    into the letterforms. I thnk there is definatelly room for the star somewhere
    in the final. Keep scetching. PLAY with the letterforms.

  body: "First off, I'd like to thank all of you for your thoughts and ideas! :) Sorry
    it's taken so long to reply, I've been a busy man (new baby, new summer job).
    But now work is done, and I'm back to school - my last semester. This logo was
    a project in school, and I'd like to refine it for my portfolio. \r\n\r\nThis
    particular logo will be on hold for a few more weeks, as I need to work on my
    self-identity first, so I can get some cards and stationary printed.  (Maybe I'll
    show you all that too, as I work on it)\r\n\r\nI'll definitely work on the shape
    of the telescope, to make it more readable. And play around with the star some
    more (it was originally filled, not outlined). When I've come up with some new
    stuff I'll post it. \r\n\r\nAbove all, I want to keep the logo economical and
    efficient. So saying that it's simplistic is sort of okay - that's what I'm going
    for. I believe a scientific group would appreciate an economical solution. And
    being able to visually represent an activity with a few geometrical shapes is
    my goal. \r\n\r\nAnd yes it's named for Harlow Shapley, a much under-appreciated
    astronomer imho. (I was almost a physics/astronomy major).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nChad"
