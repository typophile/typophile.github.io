<p>Thought this excerpt would be of interest to Typophiles. He&rsquo;s talking about how the curious problem that we have a very specialized area of our brain for reading, yet writing is such a recent phenomenon that it could not be accounted for by evolution through natural selection. This is solved by concluding that these neurons were useful for general visual recognition (deciphering the environment), and then were recruited for reading.</p>

<p>Our perceptual apparatus may be malleable but it very obviously is not abstract. There&rsquo;s no reification involved in treating physical phenomena as things.</p>
<hr>
<p>The most interesting aspect of the article excerpt is the bit in parentheses. I wasn&rsquo;t entirely taken with Changizi&rsquo;s analysis of writing systems because it seemed to me that the great variety of forms in 100+ writing systems and the greater variety of forms in nature would pretty much guarantee a large degree of topological overlap. But if systems such as shorthand, designed for speed of writing rather than speed of decipherment, do not have the same kind of topological overlap, then the explanation becomes more compelling.</p>
<p>But to come back to Craig&rsquo;s introductory paragraph &ndash; I have not read the whole Sacks article yet &ndash;, if the reading area of the brain is specialised, how did it become specialised? If this area involves neurons that were, prior to the development of writing, used for more general topological recognition, why aren&rsquo;t they still so used, and why isn&rsquo;t reading accounted for by general topological recognition?</p>
<p>There is another explanation for the existence of these neurons, which is that they were free riders, i.e. that they did not have a specific purpose prior to the development of writing, that they are not explainable by adaptationism, but are simply part of the genetic baggage carried alongside selected for traits. Of course, the existence of free riders, and our inability to distinguish with certainty traits that were selected for and those that are free riders, reduces all adaptationist explanations to more or less probable just-so stories.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t say it was abstract. I said it was more abstract than to be explained by simple reifications.
In other words, perception is not all mechanics, physical and chemical interactions, but has a certain amount of built-in nous.
Programmable software, if you like, as opposed to hardware.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean your &ldquo;free riders&rdquo; play no part in adaptionism, they are very useful in being able to cope with unprecedented situations.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There&rsquo;s no reification involved in treating physical phenomena as things.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The reification is in equating perceptions of visual stimuli with physical objects.
Perception is not reality, as various optical illusions, not to mention the cloning that occurs at one&rsquo;s blind spot, demonstrate.</p>

<p>And yet the brain has fairly well defined areas that deal with specific kinds of mental activity, so the opportunism you suggest is clearly constrained by structure. What I am querying is the apparent existence of an area of the brain that is specialised for reading, and how it came to be that way in us as a species. Obviously that area needs to be trained &ndash; literacy is not automatic &ndash;, but if that area did not exist or function as it does would reading be possible?</p>

<p>And yet some individuals who experience damage to areas of their brains which control motor skills or speech can, in some cases, relearn those skills. Opportunism will follow predisposition&ndash;the path of least resistance&ndash;but is not necessarily constrained by it.</p>

<p>Alphabetic writing was not invented in Greece.</p>
<p>What evidence does Wolfe provide for the claim that alphabetic writing was ‘feared and resisted’? I presume she cites Sokrates' parable in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Phaedrus,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which should be read in the context of Sokrates' critique of the Sophists). Anything else?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Phaedrus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> evinces either fear or resistance; rather, it conveys something that is simply true about the difference between oral and literary cultures and, hence, of what is lost in the progress from one to the other. Framing these kind of deep cultural anxieties in terms of ‘vested interests’ and ‘established culture’ might get you good term paper marks in an Marxism 101 course, but it seems to me pretty much backwards, in that the move from oral culture to literary culture involves concentration of power and wealth, and the creation of vested interests and establishments if a kind that are not possible without writing.</p>
