body: A client is looking for feedback Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1575">Gisha</a>,
  which has shipped with Windows since Vista. They're particularly interested to know
  whether this design is popular at all, especially in Israel, and whether the design
  has any flaws that might affect its popularity. I told them I would ask here, and
  also contact some colleagues in Israel, since I don't have direct knowledge of how
  widely, or not, the font might be used there. General comments on the style of the
  design, on specific letter shapes, or on technical aspects of the fonts are all
  welcome. Thanks.

    fonts provided with Microsoft's products are most of the time the ones that every
    graphic designer in Israel keep a fair distance from. \r\nMS Gisha is not popular
    in Israel at all. For my opinion it is a little bit weird...\r\nThe shape of the
    letters Noon (\u05E0) and Gimel (\u05D2) looks a little bit awkward as well the
    letters, Yod (\u05D9), Vav (\u05D5) and Final Noon (\u05DF): [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Weird
