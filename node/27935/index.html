  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In Boston I collared Norbert Florendo about a couple of points that I thought might be useful for the education session next year.  I may be a bit ahead of myself, but, I want to share with everyone my thoughts before the academic year begins and I forget my immediate impressions.  TypeCon 2006 was my first experience with the group and I had a blast.  I have practiced graphic design for over thirty years and typography has been the impetus. In addition to private practice I now teach graphic design and typography.  Standing in the classroom sharing years of experience I wonder if by teaching I gain more than I give.  When I teach I learn and there is always something to learn.</p>
<p>I would like to propose a theme for the next education session:</p>
<p>Collaboration and teamwork.  It works.</p>
<p>By nature I am a loner.  But recently I discovered that I become totally engaged while working on a project with colleagues.  The euphoria derived from the successful conclusion of a goal is as good, if not better, than what is sought after in drugs, sex &amp; rock. The quality I bring to each table is the individualism and creativity only I possess.  But this means nothing if not utilized collectively.  I have this weird abhorrence for worms and I wonder if maybe my soul fears that the only audience I will have for my creative genius is the creatures surrounding me while I decompose.</p>
<p>During the education session of TypeCon 2006 I heard several times about how much the profession has evolved into us being chief, cook and bottle washer.  Extrapolate this notion throughout the centuries and I note that successful typographers have always been thus.  Collaborate with your elders, your juniors, your IT personnel and the mailman; learn to draw, write and converse.  Have a fruit-smoothie with the twelve-year old learning Java script in summer camp.  The more we work as a team the better off we will be.</p>
<p>Hope to see you&rsquo;all next year for TypeCon 2007, let me know if I can be part of the education session.  I was impressed with what I saw at the 2006 conference and value the opportunity to build on this.</p>
