  body: I don't get that. How does a circle relate more to a vertical line than a
    slanted line?

  body: "It\u2019s because for it to work the bowls of letters like p and b would
    need to be perfect circles, and that would look like circles tacked on to slanted
    letters. But for the o to work it has to relate to them, so it has to slant like
    them."

    Design</a> has geometric O's in it's italics. I've always thought it was an interesting
    idea, but I'm not sure it really works. How would you be able to tell whether
    a word like "GOO" is italic or not?

  body: Yes, other round shapes would have to stay geometric, but I'm not sold on
    that necessarily being a bad thing. Churchward Design's G is still upright - it
    doesn't have to be.

  body: A circle as geometry has the same visual angle upright or when rotated. But
    slanting a geometric figure yields a change in all geometric forms creating an
    ellipse of the circle.  This is in  keeping with the system of italics.  To keep
    the O as a circle just makes it look out of place to most readers. What would
    happen if you slanted say the "H" in an upright roman face? It would call undue
    attention to itself and give the reader a reason to be confused.

  body: I was going to post some sketches, but I had someone break into my office
    this morning so I'll have to wait for the police to release my computer (luckily
    they stole nothing, just smashed the door ...). Just because something is unusual
    doesn't mean it can't work. Look at Avant Garde's alternates for example! They
    are in reality slanted and backslanted forms in an otherwise upright environment.

  body: Anyway, an ellipse is not all that logical in an otherwise geometrically constructed
    environment and may very well be something we just brought with us from preceeding
    styles and never really questioned. Or?

    perfect 'O' intrude too much into the top space? Perhaps your sketches will show
    how much."

  body: The convention with italic is that the letters all lean to the right. You
    could imagine that an italic geometric "O" could lean to the right simply by rolling
    or rotating, but there would be no way to distinguish it from upright. The usual
    solution to this is to design it as a tilted ellipse, which has the advantage
    that you can see which way it's leaning, and that it <em>is</em> leaning.

  body: Still, an ellipse in a geometric face is a compromise, just as not being able
    to separate (unless you consider context) an italic O from an upright is a compromise.

    would say it should fit if everything else in the face is also rotated instead
    of skewed, and that's kind of how it works in this case \u2014 the ends of strokes
    are square, the tops of letters slope downhill \u2014 but the o still stands out
    terribly, and not just for the obvious reason, I think."
