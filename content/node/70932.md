  body: I regged in just to post a comment. I think it's a drawn type since the size
    of the 'o' varies a lot. But a very similar font is Red October. Still mainly
    all the letters are different in Red October, but it's very similar... you should
    give it a try with that!

    by dustBust. You would need to re-draw the A and flip the D, but most of it is
    close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
