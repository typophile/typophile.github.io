  looked and looked and can't figure out which historical style script/handwritten
  typefaces fit into. The easy thing for me to do for the paper I have to write along
  with a song lyric poster would be to choose something easier :) But I am totally
  hung up on Caflisch Script and want to use this for my music lyrics poster. Thinking
  of a song by Evanescence. Soooo, I need to know which historical style Caflisch
  fits into, find some other fonts in that same historical style, so I can write my
  paper and create my poster. \r\n\r\nPLEASE HELP!!!"

    entry this past week on handwriting/scripts>> http://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=80
    . \r\n\r\nIn Arabic, Indian, and East Asian cultures, you see much more of a connection
    between their typography and their handwriting, and you might argue that in many
    of these places typography essentially IS handwriting, just adapted to current
    technologies. Of course, we forget that our own Latin alphabet is based off handwriting,
    probably because so many of our classic typefaces feel so constructed and architectural.
    \r\n\r\nIf you have time, you should definitely check out Gerrit Noordzij's \"The
    Stroke,\" which argues that rather than classifying fonts as serif vs. sans serif,
    or Egyptian, transitional, Venetian, etc. -- the typical classifications we learn
    in typography 101 -- we should classify them as being based on their underlying
    constructions, which are based on the movement of the pen. Noordzij classifies
    all fonts as having either a \"pointed pen\" construction (an example would be
    Bodoni), or a \"broad nib\" construction (German blackletter shows this pen technique
    very clearly). In Noordzij's classification system, even a typeface like Helvetica
    can be classified as having a pointed pen construction, just with a very low contrast
    between thicks and thins. The Letterror type foundry has some of Noordzij's writing
    up online http://www.letterror.com/noordzij/index.html. My personal opinion is
    Noordzij tends to look at the world of type through a very narrow lens, but it's
    a fascinating perspective to gain and one that seems to be lacking from American
    typography education.\r\n\r\nAll of this relates to your question because almost
    all script typefaces, and particularly Caflisch, are attempting to emulate calligraphy.
    You might want to contact Alejandro Paul, who runs Sudtipos, because most of his
    script typefaces are based on American commercial lettering from the first half
    of the 20th century. His fonts are the sort of thing you would have seen in the
    department store windows of downtown Chicago and New York, hand-painted of course.
    While there were certainly numerous \"script typefaces\" a printshop could buy
    in metal type, and then photolettering sets, before the days of digital fonts,
    Caflisch is the kind of font that takes great pains to make you believe it's hand-lettered.
    I'd imagine it's this quality that you're attracted to. So, if you're trying to
    trace back the roots of these sorts of organic, loose scripts, you should probably
    look into the history of calligraphy and lettering more than typography."
