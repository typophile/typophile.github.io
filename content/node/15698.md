    does ITC have to do with anything anyway?\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, the cover
    line was a quote taken from a lengthy article in that issue that followed an infantry
    unit from basic training to active combat in Vietnam. The war was in its early
    stages at the time and the idea that U.S. soldiers were killing little girls was
    pretty shocking to Americans at the time. This was two years before My Lai. (Source:
    The Art of Advertising, George Lois on Mass Communication, 1977.)\r\n\r\nIt doesn't
    say in the book I got this info from why Lois chose Bodoni. I suspect that he
    wanted something that looked sober and factual, and perhaps a face that looked
    like what the articles were set in. (They usually used Franklin Gothic on the
    cover.)\r\n\r\nBy the way, the three Esquire covers that made the top ten were
    all designed by George Lois. He practically set the standard of what a good magazine
    cover is."

  body: "1966 was a very different time, not only in typography and magazine design,
    but in life in the U.S. This was the first time in American history that major
    media were asking very tough questions of our government. As Mark indicates, this
    was a shock to America.  We were killing babies. I graduated from college in 1966
    and was soon after \"absorbed\" into the military. The following year, I was sent
    to Viet Nam.  I was stationed a few mile from My Lai when the massacre happened
    and heard about it from some nearby soldiers. I was there for the Tet offensive
    of 1968 and sent home the day Martin Luther King was shot. The world had changed
    greatly in 2 years. I was called a baby killer and spat upon after arriving back
    in the States.  This never would have happened 2 years earlier.\r\nSorry, back
    to type.\r\nLois probably chose a \"normal\" type to contrast this most \"un-normal\"
    act. It looked like a normal quote pulled from a magazine and just ripped your
    guts out for that reason. The land of Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and
    Lassie were jolted out of their Hollywood dream by the stark, naked, unembellished
    truth of war.\r\nSorry again, back to type.\r\nType was not an \"instant gratification
    sport\" like it is today. You had limited choices for tight deadlines like a weekly
    news magazine. Mostly, like I said before, it wasn't about the typeface. Things
    are not always about type. I wish they were, that would be much simpler a world.

  body: "For the type only cover, I'm reminded of what Bob Gill (Pentagram founder)
    had to say in his 1970s How-To book on graphic design (titled \"Forget everything
    you know about graphic design\"?), which was that the more interesting the copy
    is, the less creative treatment it needs. I think he gave the example of \"Cure
    for cancer discovered\" needing no creative spin. That philosophy was implemented
    by George Lois.\r\n\r\nThe layout style Lois used for \"Oh my God..\" was an ad
    headline style of the '60s, whereby it looked like it was a text setting, blown
    up big -- Upper and lower case, flush left. Very informal and conversational,
    like the ad copy of the time. (However, they did nuance the setting for scale
    by tightening it up a lot.)\r\n\r\nAt that time, Bodoni was appreciated as an
    un-fancy font (and is to this day by Massimo Vignelli et al), due to its rationalized
    geometric structure. Used real big in headlines, the serifs are like slab serifs,
    and the few funky idiosyncracies like the kink in the y's tail serve to roughen
    up the geometric logic of its overall construction, accentuating the \"this is
    a scrap, enlarged\" idea.\r\n\r\nCarl Ally countered Helmut Krone's \"We Try harder\"
    ads for Avis, which had body text set in something like 24 pt Perpetua Bold, with
    similar \"big type' ads for Hertz, set in Bodoni Bold. Although they were working
    with typositor types, the idea was that those guys were blowing up fine text types
    to headline size and using them as massive \"text\" weapons. This effect of typographic
    scale can be appreciated more when you hold the magazine, rather than see it in
    a reproduction.\r\n\r\nLois had done type-only headline ads (eg. \"John, is Billy
    Coughing, Get him some medicine,\" again on a black background), and I don't think
    he drew a distinction in technique between the ads and editorial. It's all about
    the Big Idea. His Esquire covers used the same creative vocabulary as his ads.
    In \"My God..\", you have a headline and body copy, with an asymmetric use of
    plenty of \"white\" space. It is the ruthless minimalism, coupled with an exact
    positioning and balance of elements, which makes this a masterpiece. And the Big
    Idea. If Andy Warhol put the language of popular, commercial culture in the art
    gallery, George Lois put conceptual art on the street.\r\n\r\nBTW, Lois had served
    in the Korean War.  "

  body: I'm interested that Cheney has sacrificed his chief of staff to the leak of
    the CIA agent. The editorials today point to him leaking the info to discreate
    anyone against the war on Iraq. Thus the congressional hearing today challenging
    the reasons for the war.

  body: "<em>It doesn\u2019t say in the book I got this info from why Lois chose Bodoni.
    I suspect that he wanted something that looked sober and factual, and perhaps
    a face that looked like what the articles were set in. (They usually used Franklin
    Gothic on the cover.)\r\n\r\nBy the way, the three Esquire covers that made the
    top ten were all designed by George Lois. He practically set the standard of what
    a good magazine cover is.</em>\r\n\r\n\r\nFWIW, one of the first jobs the young
    George Lois had as a CBS staff designer, working under William Golden, was to
    redesign all the characters of Bodoni \u2013 Didot Bodoni as they called it \u2013
    as the CBS corporate face. And he complained \u2013 jokingly \u2013 about how
    demanding Golden was. Bodoni does the job perfectly on the Esquire cover. Lois:
    big ego, but brilliant indeed.\r\n"

  body: "> the more interesting the copy is, the less creative treatment it needs.\r\n\r\nTrue.
    But a more creative treatment can still only help (although by \"creative\" I
    certainly don't mean obvious or mannered).\r\n\r\n> At that time, Bodoni was appreciated
    as an un-fancy font\r\n\r\nEven assuming we can know that, and it's true, it remains
    that a font also has an effect on people irrespective of what they <cite>think</cite>
    it's evoking.\r\n\r\n> the kink in the y\u2019s tail\r\n\r\nThat's actually a
    text-level effect, [generally] misplaced in the display realm.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
