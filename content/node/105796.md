body: "Carouge is a contemporary typeface that has a classical twist. The split-line
  feature gives Carouge a nervous and vivid look. Its subtle shapes are highly suitable
  for all types of documents, including corporate and publicity literature. The fineness
  of the types provides a pure and elegant style that is highly valued in the fashion
  and design industry. While extremely legible in small body sizes, its personality
  comes into full bloom when used in large type sizes. Carouge suggests a wide range
  of bold fonts, from Ultra Thin to Ultra. The italic companion of the roman type
  has a split-line allure with a rounded personality. \r\n\r\n<em>\u201CWhen I designed
  Carouge, I wanted to create a typeface with a sober appearance and a dash of audacity.
  Carouge provides a fine balance between two different worlds.\u201D</em> \u2014
