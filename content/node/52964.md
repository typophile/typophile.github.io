body: "   A couple of days ago I asked a questions concerning a specific font company.
  I was rightfully instructed that it was not a proper discussion. No worries there,
  I pulled the plug. Before I was enlightened, I did get a couple of responses I wasn't
  expecting. The tone was that a certain segment of the population prefers to buy
  their fonts directly from the foundry. \r\n\r\n   That begs the question - where
  do you purchase most of your fonts from: large scale operations (MyFonts or Fonts.com)
  or directly from the foundries? Why?\r\n\r\nThanks for your input and Happy Holidays.\r\nJames"

    straight from the foundry/developer (The fonts bought from FontShop being FontFonts,
    and the fonts from OurType and Underware being their own)."

    back-up download. Decent pricing. Then again, it probably supports the effort
    better to buy directly from the person who made the font. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: As I said in the other thread, I theoretically prefer to buy direct from the
    foundries. However I have also found that the payment setup can be more complicated
    and laborious depending on the foundry. Myfonts and Fontshop are really streamlined
    that way - they remember your info and you get an immediate download. I had one
    foundry recently direct me to a payment site (not paypal) that made me a little
    nervous, then there was a delay because the guy who ran/owned the foundry didn't
    get to his email right away and I didn't get the actual font download for quite
    a while. It was frustrating as I was in the middle of a job and really needed
    the instant gratification you get from the larger foundries or vendors.

  body: When I license fonts for personal use I buy directly from the maker whenever
    possible, so they get the most from the sale. But remember that some font makers
    don't have direct sales -- by choice. Some would rather partner with a foundry
    or retailer so they can concentrate on drawing type rather than managing a website,
    transaction infrastructure, customer relations, and tech support. Font retailers
    <a href="http://typographica.org/001157.php">offer more</a> to a font maker than
    marketing and a shopfront.

  body: I, too, try to purchase directly from the maker or foundry. However, from
    a logistical standpoint, I've encountered two minor problems in doing so. First,
    foundries sometimes don't have a way of providing automated emails to clients
    when updates are released; MyFonts is great in this regard, as mentioned previously.
    Second, if a maker or foundry does not have an automated download feature on their
    site (e.g. they use PayPal alone), the wait for receiving the purchased typeface
    can be excruciating. :)

  body: "Having licensed Rawlinson from James, I can attest that his setup works quite
    well. \r\n\r\nThe reason I like to go directly to the designers is the personal
    contact. If I have a question or need to modify a glyph (linguists like to create
    odd notations), I can discuss things with the person who actually made the font,
    rather than a sales or licensing department. "

  body: "It is a really good point Steve, and one that gets overlooked by a lot of
    folks.\r\n\r\nThere have been lots of discussions here on Typophile and elsewhere,
    of EULA's and font modifications, with some commenters saying that they would
    never license fonts from sources whose EULAs not allow modifications.\r\n\r\nWell,
    our EULA does not allow modifications, but Steve contacted me (we actually discussed
    this initially face-to-face at a TDC event) and wanted to know if he could add
    some additional glyphs to Rawlinson, and to change it from OT to a Type1 font
    so he could use it in TEX. I agreed and gave him permission. I would most likely
    do the same thing if another potential client requested it.\r\n\r\nSo, you might
    ask, why we have the restriction in our EULA? Simply to better control our intellectual
    property. One reason we only license our wares via our own website.\r\n\r\nJamesM"

  body: Ditto - altho Typophile also provides a nice "in" to type designers. I once
    had a designer give me an extra set of lining figs and fractions which I really
    needed for a project, even tho I had bought the font thru FontShop. Very helpful.

  body: "\"I agreed and gave him permission. I would most likely do the same thing
    if another potential client requested it.\"\r\n\r\nJames sites another good reason
    to get to know your type designer. EULAs are in place to protect intelectual property
    from fraudulant usage and hinder piracy. This does not mean that a legitimate
    client can't ask for and receive permission to do something prohibited by the
    EULA. James granted permission for a reasonable request. I am sure many designers
    would do the same if it was reasonable and the client was a trusted person. The
    moral of the story is that you should ASK the type designer or foundry before
    you do anything outside the EULA. They really do want to help their legitimate
    clients.\r\n\r\nTHANKS, JAMES!\r\n\r\nChrisL"
