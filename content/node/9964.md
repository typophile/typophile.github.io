  similiar to this. I&#39;ve found a half dozen in old spec books and signage books
  and baseball logos and such but nothing in a font. I am absoultely sure its out
  there. Please forgive me, I don&#39;t tink I&#39;ve been too lazy on this one. Any
  help would be greatly appreciated. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/6818.jpg"

    the closest to the skeleton of the designs I&#39;m working with. I want to make
    sure that I have put enough variation into the alphabet that I&#39;ve developed.Here

    is probably the closest I found. Sorry to take up precious message board space
    only to answer my own question. I will try to refrain from asking questions so
    early in my process next time. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help Sean Michael
