body: I keep wanting to Americanize it and say "Tish-hold" but I'm pretty sure that's
  not right. It sounds more like a professional wrestling move.

  body: "The beginning and end are not problems. Tschi is pronounced like chi in 'chicken',
    and 'old' as normal. The middle 'ch' in 'Tschichold' is, however, a problem for
    English speakers. It is properly pronounced like the 'ch' in 'J.S. Bach'. This
    is the gutteral h, a sound not normal in English. I have heard English use the
    English 'sh' sound instead. \r\n\r\nSo if you can manage to say the composer 'Bach'
    correctly, then you can go for: 'chi-CHold', with the 'CH' the german gutteral
    h. Or if you want to Anglicise it it--which is perfectly OK, I think--it is 'Chi-shold'.\r\n\r\nedit:
    I guess the natural way to Americanize it is 'chickold', but I think 'chishold'
    is a bit nicer and closer to the German.    "

    frenchmen It's a bit hard. I pronounce \"Nort-tza\xEF\")\r\n- Bram de Does\r\n-
    Peter Bil'ak\r\n(Seems easy (is it?), but I'm not sure if it's not \"Bil-atch\",

    soft l, as you pronounce it in glitter, but not like in light."

  body: "Peter Bi\u013Eak is pronounced the same way it is written. All the letters
    are read, no one stays silent.\r\n\r\np\u025Bt\u025Br b\u026Al\u02B2ak\r\n\r\nPeter
    (as the English word \"pet\", then again the sound \"e\" from the word \"pet\"
    and finally rolled \"r\"*)\r\nBi\u013Eak (\"bi\" as in \"bitter\", \"lak\" is
    pronounced as \"luck\" in English, but \"\u013E\" should be softer, palatalized**)\r\n\r\nThe
    stress is alway on the first syllable.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia: \r\n* \"rolled r\"
    like in Italian, Scottish, Bavarian\r\n** \u013E is pronounced nowadays by many
    speakers, esp. from western Slovakia, as a non-palatalized l, esp. in li and le
    where the caron is not written. The officially correct pronunciation of li and
    le as palatalized is already frequently perceived as marked (either as a trait
    of middle and eastern dialect, or as a feature of language zealots). (A similar
    tendency occurs in yeista Spanish, where however the palatal ll is pronounced
    like English j instead of \u03BB.)\r\n\r\n"
