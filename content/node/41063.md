body: "I'm designing a logo for a stationary line, and after much research I'm still
  clueless about what font to use.  The stationary can be described as modern, bold,
  elegant and feminine (not overly feminine, though) and the company has a strong
  \"earth friendly\" profile.  I have been thinking of Coquette, but I'm not sure...
  \ I also need a compainion font that can be used for product info placed directly
  under the logo.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated!"

    consider the elegant and rather feminine:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/diotima/\">Diotima</a>
    by Gudrun Zapf von Hesse,\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/nofret-be/\">Nofret</a>
    also by Gudrun Zapf von Hesse,\r\n\r\nor <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/weiss-antiqua/\">Weiss
    Antiqua</a> by Emil Rudolf Weiss, among several others like this.\r\n\r\nReally,
    any of the \"classics\" from richly calligraphic Venetian Humanist fonts like
    Jenson and Bembo to crisper Romantic Didones like Bodoni, Didot and Walbaum could
    be made to work very well for a project like this.\r\n\r\nDavid Thometz"

    said that, I've never had a client accept it yet!)\r\n\r\nIf you want something
    modern, elegant and gentle without being <em>too</em> feminine, why not consider
    a light weight of [[Avenir]]? It's hugely versatile."
