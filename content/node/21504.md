  at the Forums page, it shows my name as most recent poster but the posts are not
  visable ? Whaahhzup?\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: I see making a new thread works but
  adding to an old thread takes your post into the great unknown.\r\n\r\nLooks like
  the last post showing up was about 10 hours ago. Hang in there Christian! You have
  yet to even get your first cup of coffee and \"the site\" is freakin' on you :-)\r\nHave
  a doughnut first.  You work better on unhealthy junk food than stuff like whole
  wheat grains."
