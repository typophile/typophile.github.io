body: "Hi guys,\r\nthis condensed serif sample was cropped (and enlarged, sorry for
  the bad quality) from the cover of the italian edition of a Jeffery Deaver book.
  I submitted it to What The Font and the results were pretty close, but not almost
  there, so I guess your legendary knowledge is needed to identify it :)\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dodicesima_4355.jpg]"

  body: Looks squooshed - stretched vertically, because the vertical serifs are much
    thinner than the horizontal ones. So the actual typeface might not be as condensed.

  body: If you stretch the sample horizontally by 250% you get <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fairfield/">Fairfield
    Bold or Heavy</a>.
