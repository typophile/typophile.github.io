body: "This has been stumping me for weeks; I must not have the right books. Even
  my mortifying old Letraset catalog doesn't show it. I think this is also the typeface
  used for the wordmark of Genentech, but I could be wrong (by now this logo must
  have been scanned and re-drawn a number of times). I see differences in the n's
  in these 2 images, but the logo could have been customized. The signage is from
  the parking garage at SFO.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I recall seeing this design a lot
  more when I was a lad (which would be the 1970s). I can't find it, but I'm quite
  sure it was a retail typeface. Does anyone remember it?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/genentechLOGO_5821.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sansimage_4837.jpg]"

  body: "The airport lettering looks like Modula, which had about 5 weights (shown
    in \"Homage to the Alphabet\" by Phil's Photo). There was a digital version of
    a medium weight that was called Obsidda by NovelFonts for which I can make a sample
    shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
