  body: "D'oh, having trouble with attachments. I was looking at the type used in
    the top nav here:\r\n\r\nhttp://steelpantherrocks.com/main.aspx\r\n\r\n...but
    I think I've identified it as Ray Larabie's Squealer:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/squealer/regular/\r\n\r\nI
    didn't think that was it to begin because I had an older version that apparently
    didn't have proper caps, but looking at the OTF version on MyFonts I think that's
    it."
