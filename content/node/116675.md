    No matter what software you use, it's good to keep in mind that fonts can be very
    volatile to operating systems, especially in large numbers.\r\n\r\nThat being
    said, you may want to test drive [[http://www.fontexplorerx.com/|Font Explorer]]
    by Monotype.\r\n\r\nI've had to stress test and implement font management to a
    large team of artists in the past, and everywhere that Suitcase came up short,
    Font Explorer excelled. It seemed to handle large numbers of activated fonts a
    little better than Suitcase, and they have auto-activation plug-ins for many of
    the common Adobe products. As well, you really can't beat the depth of the program.
    It can even show you broken down character maps by language and the kerning pairs
    of different fonts. I think they just released the PC version about a year or
    two ago, so it's for either platform now, and it's well supported/updated (by
    Monotype).\r\n\r\nBest of luck in your search!"

    I find that there's not enough real \"management\" options with FontBook.\r\n\r\nI
    tend to activate groups of fonts temporarily, or on a per-project basis, and Suitcase
    is well-suited to my way of working (it helps that I've used it for many years
    and it has nearly always worked this way).\r\n\r\nWe use Universal Type Server
    at my current job, and it's basically Suitcase Lite (from the user's POV)."

    stay way from Apple's <strong>Font Book</strong> which only has limitations.\r\n<strong>Font
    Book</strong> is not professional and the smart sets are terrible and fail to
    do their task.\r\nIt's a bland software for Microsoft users who type r\xE9sum\xE9s
    and lessons on Word.\r\n<strong>Suitcase Fusion</strong> has a powerful search
    fonction through QuickFind and QuickMatch and other options.\r\nIt's a treat to
    classify your library with it.\r\n \r\n<blockquote>What font management would
    you recommend?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYou have two choices: <strong>Suitcase Fusion</strong>
    or <strong>Font Explorer</strong>.\r\nI use <strong>Suitcase Fusion</strong> from
    the first version and I'm satisfied with its version 5.\r\nI used to move from
    <strong>Adobe ATM de Luxe</strong> to <strong>Suitcase Fusion</strong>.\r\n<strong>Font
    Explorer</strong> has some 'terrific' OpenType features preview including ligatures
    (common, rare) activation, letterspacing, kerning, tracking. I wish they could
    include them on <strong>Suitcase Fusion</strong>."

    Explorer for a couple of weeks, to decide if I wanted to switch. I had a brand
    new laptop to configure.\r\n\r\nI liked Font Explorer's OpenType support, language
    info, and character map showings. Both it and Suitcase Fusion have plug-ins for
    current and recent Creative Suite/Cloud apps. Font Explorer supports more antique
    versions, though.\r\n\r\nIn the end, what drove me nuts about Font Explorer was
    that its \u201Cfamily groupings\u201D were only the style-linked groupings. No
    more than four members to a family. So a mega-family like Kepler would show up
    as 40+ families in Font Explorer, but I could show it as just one in Suitcase
    Fusion.\r\n\r\nSo Font Explorer was just too unwieldy for me, based on that. I
    switched back to Suitcase Fusion. I may occasionally miss some FEX features, but
    at least I am not going crazy every single day."

    wrong because when choosing family grouping instead of style linking many font
    families are not properly grouped. For exemple :\r\n<strong>Avenir</strong> {Avenir
    Roman, Avenir Oblique}, \r\n<strong>Avenir Black</strong> {Avenir Black}, \r\n<strong>Avenir
    Black Oblique</strong> {Avenir Black Oblique}, \r\n<strong>Avenir Book</strong>
    {Avenir Book Roman, Avenir Book Oblique}, \r\netc."

    I was missing something.\r\n\r\nNote however that if the font producer doesn't
    set up the fonts correctly, the font management app can't really work around that.
    I have certainly seen fonts from some foundries that did not behave well in this
    regard, in <em>any</em> font manager."
