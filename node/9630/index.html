  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">When I was first in school for design I remember finding the Pricing &amp; Ethical Guidelines book and found it very intriguing.  I also found it cool that there was a organized union for Designers, and they could help you get a lawyer if  you ever felt ripped off.  (nice insurance for those of us in school weary of becoming a freelancer).  I never did join but was something I wanted to do once I graduated school. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway in the middle of here I transfered to Portland Oregon. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The head of design of my new school is an AIGA member(an organization that is a lot more potent it seems than GAG) and he stresses that AIGA is very important to join, just for the contacts alone.  The only impact I feel they have had in my community is a bunch of guest speakers (and I am not complaining).  On the surface level they seem to offer a lot of the same stuff that GAG does. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I am a little confused.  Who does what?  If they both do the same thing who should I join?  Should I even join at all? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A while back I was talking to a friend of mine who is also the head of the AIGA student group, and I asked him&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;What does AIGA do?&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;pfft no one really knows&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I graduate really soon and am confused.  I was hoping I could get some good testimonials on here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for any information.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">After not attending a single AIGA function for 5 years, I gave up my membership.  It is better for young people as a place to meet.  Our local chapter does a lot of TGIFing at bars.  It is definitely a 30s and younger thing. If you are new in your area, it might be something to join for a year or two.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&quot;he stresses that AIGA is very important to join, just for the contacts alone&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He's 100% right about that. AIGA's main benefit to any member is that it's a good networking tool. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other benefits are all debatable. Some folks find a lot to get out of the AGIA, some folks don't. I was in it throughout school and a handful of years afterwords before finally bowing out. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's not a union of any sort. More of a club.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've been an on-again-off-again member since being in school. For me, it's the events and the possiblity for networking that matters. But even then, it can be hard if the design community is insular. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AIGA seems like one of those things where 50% scoff and roll their eyes and 50% treat it as part of being a designer. I'm still undecided.</div>
