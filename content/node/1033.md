  body: Thanks a lot David, <BR> <BR>But El Greco is expensive, and it does not seem
    a 100 % match. <BR>Is there anything else that is close? <BR> <BR>Thank you!

  body: You&#39;re right that it&#39;s not an exact match, because the A has been
    modified. Casaday &amp; Greene has a font they called &#34;Calligraphy&#34; which
    has that modification. That in turn was &#39;borrowed&#39; by SSi for something
    they called &#34;Daniela&#34; &#40;see sample of El Greco and Calligraphy at <a
    href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script02Pg1.html" target="_blank">http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script02Pg1.html</a>&#41;.
    You might be able to use Fontseek to locate a copy of Daniela at a free site.

    do you need Macintosh?

  body: Thank all of you for help. I converted &#34;Daniela&#34; to Mac font, and
    proofed it to the customer. Hopefully they&#39;ll like it although &#34;f&#34;
    looks a bit different. <BR> <BR>I appreciate you guys!!
