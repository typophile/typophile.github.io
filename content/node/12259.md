  need to provide some examples of how certain type faces might be used. I hasten
  to add that I have little control over <i>which</i> faces they are. Some of them
  are nice, some are not my favorites. Anyway, what I want to know is: can some of
  you good people think of any really amazing things that have been done using:\r\n\r\nFutura,
  Univers 55, Mrs Eaves, Optima, Helvetica Neue Black Extended, VAG rounded or Minion?\r\n\r\nHmm...
  An odd collection to be sure.\r\n\r\nWell, let me know if you think of anything.
  If you provide a link I'd love you forever, but just the info would be good.\r\n\r\nThanks
  :)\r\n\r\n\u2014sn0w"

    my home page... I think it's not the extended weight of the face, but helvetica
    neue black. Such a good one, though, I'm going to have to use it anyway :)\r\n\r\nI
    like the eight08 one, very inventive use of the 'gi' ligature indeed!\r\n\r\nThank
    you formlos, most kind."

    be using. Thanks jsandvik!\r\n\r\nI've found another great one for Futura: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fedex.com\r\n\r\nI've
    always liked their logo, since a tutor at art college pointed out the hidden arrow
    between the E and the x... Subtle, but nice :)\r\n\r\nKeep 'em coming!"
