    however, rank #1 as the oldest with the most typographic content on the web (our
    9th birthday is this week).'

  body: "We are a blog, among other things: [[http://typophile.com/uppercaseblogs]].
    I have been interested to see the quality of the uppercase blogs at Typophile
    improving as more people get into it. Because it has such a broad base of authors,
    the content quality varies, but you get some esoteric things you might not find
    anywhere else. \r\n\r\nI have have sometimes debated whether to post on my Typophile
    uppercase blog or on my site [[http://betatype.com]]. It seems like if you are
    interested in spending the time and posting nearly every day, you could gain a
    readership on your personal type blog. If you are interested in posting from time
    to time, but want to reach a broad readership and get feedback, the uppercase
    blogs are a good place to write.\r\n\r\nFor now, I have decided to use Betatype
    as a project blog and post to my Typophile blog if there is a typographic point
    of interest somewhere else on the web. In reality, I post very rarely to either
