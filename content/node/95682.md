body: "\u2022 Paul Hunt\r\nDespite my best intentions, the work you did for me to
  improve my Whiz-Bang Woodtype line never saw the light of day. First off, Miss Tiffany
  clued me into a Russian website which was supposedly giving my commercial fonts
  away. Unfortunately, she was on a Mac and I was on a PC. Four pages or so into the
  site, my Windows 2000 machine got infected with a virus so aggressive that I fried
  my hard drive, trying to contain it. Lessons learned too late: back up critical
  files often. All your work got nuked in the process.\r\n\r\nThen, six months later,
  my avocation became a full-time job, when I got downsized. Still, I owe you for
  the valuable lessons you taught me. If you can find out from MyFonts and Monotype
  what my net sales were from the time you did the work until now, I will pay you
  the promised 50%\u2014up to $1,000 now, and the balance as I can earn it, in one
  way or another, from my tarnished brand.\r\n\r\n\u2022 To the folks at P22\r\nAnother
  casualty of the above crash was Julia O\u2019Connor\u2019s address. I owe her 50%
  of net sales from Jimbatz NF. I am confident that you have an equally fair arrangement
  with her. Get me the figures, and I will fulfill my part of our handshake-only deal
  before pulling the plug.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Jonathan Martz\r\nGirls Are Weird inspired
  Boyz R Gross NF; same deal.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Stephen Coles\r\nIf you still cannot forgive
  me for the unpardonable sin of ignorance of your reverence for the late Doyald Young,
  contact Dave Simpson at Sign DNA, who purchased the \u201Crights\u201D to Creampuff
  for $167, and has been selling it for the past 11 years or so as Waldo. See how
  generous he is, and cut me some slack, dude.\r\n"

    X. Solo's Honey Script, when YOU owned the rights to the Film-o-type version?
    I never made a penny on all the work but, surely, your bellyaching to myfonts
    was occasioned by some suspicion of monetary loss, right?\r\n\r\nRight, Stu? Hmmmm?\r\n\r\nStill
    waiting on Julia O'Connor's address\u2026"
