body: "Hello everyone. I'm rather excited that I'm starting my first ever Typophile
  thread. I'm interested in my fellow Typohpiles' thoughts on an idea I had for an
  InDesign feature that might solve a number of related typesetting problems.\r\n\r\nA
  recent Typohpile thread asked if there's an automated way to create a diagonal strikethrough
  through a piece of text. Let's imagine there is. Of course, for this to be possible,
  you would have to be able to tell InDesign where to start and stop this formatting
  and to treat everything in between these points as a solid clump of text. Otherwise,
  if this were a character-level option, you might get this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text1_3724.jpg]\r\ninstead
  of this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text2_5785.jpg]\r\nBut even if InDesign
  knew to make the diagonal span the entire selected phrase, what would happen if
  two adjacent strings of text had this effect applied? Would the strikethrough span
  the whole thing? How would the program know that two separate diagonals are wanted?
  The same problems apply to the idea of automating horizontal brace brackets, etc.
  used to show a grouping of text, in grammar textbooks, for example, as well as centering
  metrical diacritics above specific syllables (clusters of letters) in studies of
  poetry. I have needed to do all of these things at various points and found that
  there's no way to do them \"automatically\" \u2014 i.e., without drawing or dragging
  characters on another layer over the text frame and positioning them by hand.\r\n\r\nHere's
  another example: I may be designing a children's book that occasionally has phrases
  printed upside-down or mirror-image. It would be wonderful to be able to apply these
  options to text, just as they can be applied to an object (in this case, a text
  frame), but this creates some of the same problems as above. If I want to invert
  just a word within a paragraph, InDesign would have to know to think of that cluster
  of letters as one entity and thus flip the entire chunk, not just the individual
  characters. (Not to mention contend with line breaks and reflowing text, etc.)\r\n\r\nA
  last example: When designing literary journals, I sometimes want to center poetry
  on its longest line: in other words, let the whole block remain flush left, but
  center it as a whole relative the the page margins. I currently do this by centering
  the longest line, then selecting the rest of the lines and indenting them to match.
  But what if you could select the whole poem, tell InDesign, \"treat this text as
  one 'chunk,'\" and center that \"chunk\"?\r\n\r\nIn the first two examples, what
  I am talking about is really a type of formatting that is higher than character-level
  but lower than paragraph-level; the last example could easily be a higher-than-paragraph-level
  setting.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to propose the addition of two new special characters:
  \"begin adjustment cluster\" and \"end adjustment cluster.\" They would be invisible
  characters that would instruct the program to treat some text as a single entity
  in regards to a certain operation. I'm very interested in hearing others' thoughts
  on this idea, as well as any other uses that such a feature might have. Of course,
  many of the examples here would require additional features for manipulating text
  that don't yet exist within the program, but allowing the user to specify a sort
  of custom level on which to apply text formatting could open the door to a variety
  of such features.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nJosh"

    try posting your question at the site \"InDesign Secrets\" (indesignsecrets.com)
    where they are good at coming up at InDesign workarounds.\r\n\r\nFor flipping
    an individual word upside down that still flows with the text, you could create
    a separate small text box containing just that word, rotate the box 180 degrees,
    copy that box (not the word but the entire box) to the clipboard, place your cursor
    where you want it to go, and then paste. This will paste the upside-down-box inline
    on that line of text, and it will reflow with that text if the line reflows.\r\n\r\n>

    putting a tab at the beginning of each line of the poem, then select the entire
    poem and give that whole block just one tab -- a \"center\" tab -- and adjust
    that \"center\" tab until the entire centered poem has it's longest line just
    touching the left margin."

  body: "InDesign secrets \u2014 I'll look into that.\r\n\r\n\"This will paste the
    upside-down-box inline\" Yes, this is what I usually do. Not fun, though, if it's
    a several-word phrase and reflowing breaks it. (Although, to be fair, I can't
    say this happens often at all, or even that this particular example has come up
    more than a couple times.)\r\n\r\n\"Not sure if I'm understanding correctly...\"
    Judging by your suggestion, I think you may not have, but probably I was unclear.
    It's typical in poetry anthologies to set poems flush left, but center the entire
    flush left block of text between the left and right margins. All the lines line
    up on the left edge, but where the left edge falls is dependent on how long the
    longest line is. Only the longest line will actually be \"centered.\" So, it is
    the left indent (or a left tab) that would be needed, not a center tab. Doing
    this manually, by dragging a tab stop or increasing the indent in the tool bar
    thingy isn't a nuisance for one poem, but if you have a hundred pages of poems
    \u2014 wouldn't it be nice to be able to make it part of the style? This would
    necessitate, though, that you designate what to treat as one clump, which brings
    me to the idea I was proposing above.\r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestions.\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: "Josh, I think part of your demands could be addressed with features available
    in InDesign since version CS3. Here is one possible solution for centering poems
    or a-like texts.\r\n\r\n<strong>Centered poems</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>(a)</em> cut
    the text and paste it in a blank area to create a new frame. Adjust its width
    to match the longest line. Cut the frame (not the text) and paste it into the
    original frame. Now you can center the paragraph where the frame was inserted
    and it will align accordingly.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capture_01032011_030023_4230.gif]\r\n.\r\n\r\n<em>(b)</em>
    select the poem and convert it to an one-column table. Reduce table width to match
    the longest line. Format table lines and internal spaces to achieve the same format
    as a plain text (ideally, you must create table and cell styles to automate this).
    Center the outer paragraph (where the table was inserted). This procedure has
    an advantage over the first one as it allows text/table flow through column and
    page breaks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capture_01032011_030418_4638.gif]\r\n.\r\n\r\n<strong>Upside-down
    text</strong>\r\n\r\nBy now, there is no solution for this in InDesign. The method
    you did adopt is the best ID can achieve. But you can easily solve the problem
    creating an upside-down version of the font in use, what takes just minutes in
    FontLab.\r\n\r\nOpen the font, select all glyphs and do a vertical flip. The glyphs
    with ascenders or descenders will be vertically misaligned, so you need to realign
    them. The best way to do this is to measure ascender and descender heights, select
    a group of glyphs (say, all lowercase with descenders) and do a shift (Transofrm
    panel) by this measure.\r\n\r\nBefore export, rename the font to avoid conflict
    with the original one. The remaining aspects are the same: no need to edit spacing,
    kerning or OT features. Note you new crazy-like font permits normal text flow
    with kerning and even hyphenation.\r\n\r\nOf course, this need to be allowed by
    the EULA. \r\n\r\nTo get mirror right-to-left text you must convert it to backwards
    text. There are a number of sites which do this using JavaScript, like [[http://www.java-scripts.net/javascripts/Backwards-Text-Converter.phtml|this]].
    If you need just backwards text, this is enough. If it also must be flipped, you
    can apply the upside-down font.\r\n\r\nLater I will try to add solutions for your
    other issues."

  body: "I guess I misunderstood your centering question. I'd probably just select
    the poem and apply a left indent until the longest line looked centered. It's
    not as slick as having an automated method, but it shouldn't take more than a
    few seconds. It would have the disadvantage, though, that any changes you made
    to the text later (font, point size, etc) might make it off-center.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    you probably know this already, but if you select some text and then click in
    the left indent box in the control panel, you can then use your keyboard's arrow
    keys to increase or decrease the value incrementally. Sometimes that's faster
    than entering a value, seeing the result, entering a new value, etc."

    style sheets or paragraph style sheets.\r\n\r\nBut I'm just not sure that any

  body: "Actually, ID has a sort of cluster approach with GREP styles and nested styles.
    So the problem is not to pick up some text fragment, but to apply <em>one</em>
    format to it. Although I'm not otimistic about Adobe to do that, I'd like very
    much to see this:\r\n\r\n<strong>1</strong>. To add a diacritic for a syllabe.\r\n<strong>2</strong>.
    To add a graphic mark (say, horizontal bracket) to a sequence of text.\r\n<strong>3</strong>.
    To highlight text with a proper tool (no need to adulterate strikethrough and
    underline).\r\n<strong>4</strong>. To add vertical bar at left or right of a text
    fragment.\r\n<strong>5</strong>. To permit hanging text (today this is possible
    with anchored frames).\r\n<strong>6</strong>. To have real conditional text (actual
    tool is very limited).\r\n\r\nSo, to put it simple, I'm also interested in your
    idea to ID improvement.\r\n\r\n<cite>I'm aware there are plenty of workarounds
    for these issues</cite>\r\n\r\nPlenty? I'm unsure if there is even one way to
    achieve each of the results you described without doing time-consuming manual
    adjusts. The poem centered with table is easy, but I never saw this solution before
    \u2013even in InDesign Secrets or other specialized sites.\r\n\r\nIf you know
    other workarounds to automate these operations, it would well deserve an article
    in ID Secrets. Many ID users could benefit from it."

  body: "Unfortunately, I don't know any secret ways to do these things without \"time-consuming
    manual adjusts\" \u2014 so I guess what I really meant by \"workarounds\" was
    \"various ways of accomplishing [whatever] in a time consuming and manual fashion.\"
    Such as manually positioning frames or placing frames into the text stream and
    kerning them over text or using anchored objects, etc.\r\n\r\nI too would like
    to see all of the things you've listed above. More than once I've spent hours
    positioning breves and ictuses (ictii?) to center them visually over the relevant
    syllable in metrically scanned poetry by converting them to outlines, aligning
    them to a horizontal guide above the line of text and adjusting the horizontal
    spacing manually. What this has in common with horizontal braces, inverted text,
    centering on longest lines, etc., is that it requires the same effect to be applied
    to each of the several characters (or lines) that have it applied with different
    results.\r\n\r\nThe vertical bar feature, which I have also wanted, should, however,
    be simple enough to add as a paragraph option, as it would work similarly to the
    existing paragraph rule tools.\r\n\r\nOh, and thank you for the single-cell table
    idea. I hadn't thought of that. Although I'm not sure I understand how this is
    different than pasting a text frame into a centered paragraph, as you describe
    in option (a) above.\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n(Edit: Ooh! How about a \"bracket\" tool
    that would place a bracket above, below, or vertically in the margin by a selected
    piece of text? It could have options including square bracket, parenthesis, brace,
    straight line, angle bracket, maybe others.)"

  body: "The difference between option (a) and (b): with the table you can resize
    the frame or link it to another one and the table will flow. With a rigid frame
    inside other, there is no way to flow text.\r\n\r\nAbout horizontal brackets,
    I was thinking if it's not a viable idea to make this with underline plus special
    open and close glyphs. Let me try a better description: suppose you need to add
    a bracket below the word <strong>thing</strong>. With special glyphs, you insert
    the \"open bracket\", type the word, apply underline to it and insert the \"close
    bracket\". If properly designed, these open and close glyphs would glue to the
    underline and compose a bracket.\r\n\r\nTo make a bracket above, you just need
    open and close glyphs at the top of leading and a baseline-shifted underline.
    To simulate parenthesis and braces, four more pair of open and close glyphs do
    the trick. It's not perfect, but may be useful.\r\n\r\n<cite>More than once I've
    spent hours positioning breves and ictuses</cite>\r\n\r\nI believe the easier
    way to do this is to add a small anchored frame and insert the diacritic there.
    As it's anchored, it will follow text flow. And if you define anchored frame preferences
    (position, relationship to the anchor, size) it will be automatically positioned
    at next insertions.\r\n"
