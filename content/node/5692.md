    <BR>A return is apparently normal price though. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: The architecture in Berlin is nice, and there is a lot of it.  <BR> <BR>Can&#39;t
    tell you anyplace specific to go and eat, though. Make sure that you try some
    Currywurst while you are there, if you haven&#39;t before. Although the currywurst-craze
    has spread throughout Germany, it started in Berlin, and doesn&#39;t get any better.
    You can find some anywhere in the city.

    party complex &#39;Kuhdorf&#39; off Kurf&uuml;rstendamm. go for the Blade Runner/william
    Gibson feel. <BR> <BR>Quirky shopping &#43; galleries in Mitte <BR> <BR>There
