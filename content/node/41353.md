  by [[Joel Nordstr\xF6m]] 2002\r\n\r\nPublished by [[Lineto]]\r\n\r\nThe logo of
  a <a href=\"http://www.raygil.ch\">RAYGIL</a> coffee machine was the starting point
  for this caps-only [[stencil]] font. The designer of the logo probably used a variant
  of [[Frankfurter]] and made a stencil version of the 6 characters he needed. KADA
  was drawn from scratch without further reference to [[Frankfurter]] and the result
  now serves well as a very bold and graphic headline typeface, offering 2 alternate
  character sets on the upper case and lower case within the same font."
