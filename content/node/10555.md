  body: Alex, look at making the border a tint of your black and look at PMS blacks
    like PMS Black 6 which has a red tint in it. The PMS blacks have a bit more depth.
    As for the type look at the spacing between the E,X and A &#40;EX to tight XA
    to loose&#41;,  the J and O and the K,O and M it seems to be a bit loose. Last
    point I haven&#39;t a clue what that mark in the middle of the card is. Good start

  body: Thanks for the advice Daniel. <BR> <BR>I was actually thinking of going with
    PMS Black 12, but the printer said it would be more expensive, so I&#39;m still
    debating whether or not to use it. I also want to print with raised ink if I can
    afford it. <BR> <BR>The mark in the middle is a quarter rest from musical notation.
    I put it on the card so people would ask me about it, and it would be a quirky
    reminder of me whenever they see the card. <BR> <BR>I was also thinking of going
    with OSF for the phone number. I know that this is not normally advised, but it
    might work. I&#39;ll post a sample when I get home. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: 'You also need to raise the parentheses in the phone number, to center them
    on the type. If you go for OSF-numerals the position of the par&#39;s is probably
    going to be ok. <BR>Oh, and don&#39;t use a division, but a proper en-line. <BR>Oh
    once more: I find @&#39;a are almost always too big. Reduce it&#39;s size a bit
    and adjust the spacing to the left a bit. <BR>Aaaanndd: less space after the point
    after your initial would be an improvement, too.'

  body: Thanks Bert. <BR> <BR>Looking at the @, I agree with you. I&#39;ll take it
    down a couple of point sizes and use a bolder weight. <BR> <BR>I always thought
    that hyphens were used in phone numbers. The line is actually a hyphen &#40;<a
    href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/F/JENA/F_JENA-10005000.html" target="_blank">as
    you can see here</a>&#41;. Should I go with the en-dash anyway because the hyphen
    is so slanted? What about lowering the macron down to the same level as the hyphen,
    as it has a nicer shape than the en-dash? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also wondering about
    the space between the parentheses and the rest of the phone number. To me it looks
    a little big. What do you guys think? <BR> <BR> - Lex

    interesting.'

  body: I see. My original design had a thinner border. Maybe I&#39;ll take the outer
    stroke down a half a point  and the inner one down by a quarter point or so. <BR>

  body: Lex in the future could you post jpgs or gifs. pdfs are annoying. Thanks  <BR>
    <BR>The parentheses still aren&#39;t centered on the numbers. I&#39;d consider
    loosing them all together. Just use a dash. Your upper left outside border isn&#39;t
    butting correctly. There is a slight gap. The Ko in you last name need a little
    tighting.  <BR> <BR>One last thought, if you use raised printing make sure you
    see samples. It tends to make artwork expand as if it had a stroke on it.

  body: The G and D of Graphic Designer need some attention to kerning compared to
    your name, but the overall kerning is better. There is no hard and fast international
    rule for the use of hyphens or en-dash in the phone number, I suspect it is somewhat
    governed by local preferences, but I agree that the hyphen is a stronger character
    than the en-dash. Neither of the rules of your border join at the top left corner
    on the pdf&#42;. Another thing to consider when using borders is that the trimming
    process can be slightly inaccurate and give you off-centre borders, you can either
    speak sternly to your printer or consider an assymetric design. <BR>Tim <BR>&#42;
    a good reason to use a pdf, although it is simpler to view a jpeg on screen.

  body: Daniel, <BR>I was going to post the GIF, but CorelDraw 8 does some funny things
    with exporting. A lot of the kerning problems of the original, such as the LE
    in ALEXANDER were caused in part by this. I&#39;ll try a version without parentheses.
    <BR> <BR>I used the &#34;Caption&#34; optical weight of <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1716.html"
    target="_blank">Adobe Jenson Pro</a>. Should I use the regular weight to compensate
    for the raised printing, or should I go to Caption Light? <BR> <BR>Alessandro,
    <BR>I like the spacing around the phone number and e-mail address in your version.
    I&#39;ll try to match it. I&#39;ll also increase the mark&#39;s size. I still
    like the border, but maybe I can go with embossing &#40;again increasing the price&#41;
    instead of printed to put the focus on the text. <BR> <BR>Tim, <BR>I think the
    hyphen works well too. The unjoined border is, again, something that happened
    when I exported from CorelDraw. I&#39;ll try to figure out how to fix that. My
    original design &#40;I didn&#39;t post it here&#41; had borders much closer to
    the edge of the card and I moved them in for the reason you mentioned. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    again to everyone for helping me out with this. I&#39;ll post some updates later
    today. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: Lex, fyi the PDF makes your type look heavier. I would print a version of
    your latest layout and contact your printer and discuss potential problems of
    raised printing. Talking to your printer early on can save a lot of problems later
    as Tim noted. That design might have 20% waste just from cutting. <BR> <BR>One
    last thought, if you are going to emboss anything, let it be you mark in the middle
    of the card. Make it a blind emboss or a pastel foil emboss. You might also look
    into a foil stamp.

  body: Adjust the spacing between the names. Think of the space as volume and not
    distance. &#34;Jos&#34; should be moved towards the K, or the last name should
    be moved towards &#34;Jos&#34;. <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/71065.jpg"

  body: Are you certain that you need that border?  Unless you've got a very anal/fancy/expensive
    printer, chances are you're going to have a very hard time getting that thing
    to center properly when the cards get cut.    The small size of a business card
    is just going to draw attention to the small inaccuracies that will certainly
    come from the cutting.
