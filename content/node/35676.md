  and more headline fonts that employ decoration for decoration's sake - and lots
  of them! This got me wondering; if we're heading in a generally decorative direction,
  I'm presuming that poor typographers have already set text in display typefaces
  ... I've certainly seen my share of brochures printed in Papyrus. But what are good
  contemporary examples of decorative text typefaces (I'm assuming here that there
  are some)? Old blackletter books come to mind ... but has the need for speed eliminated
  the possibility of decorative text outside of art books? I've seen manuscript web
  sites, such as coldplay.com - will we see simulated handwriting in books? \r\n\r\nCan
  text type can be decorative, and still effective?"

    it's more like a Herb Lubalin thing but a well executed handwritten book would
    be a real joy to read.\r\n\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    doses. Papyrus in a large enough size will work if the text is a sentance or two
    at a time. But I really wouldn't want to read a couple hundred words in it. (And
    neither would most people, making the brochure ineffective.)"
