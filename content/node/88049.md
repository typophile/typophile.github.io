  body: "It is if I haven't Helvetica installed or better yet, if I haven't a version
    of Helvetica on which the CSS declaration and my system can agree.\r\nIn this
    case the declaration is pretty drastic: font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;\r\nIt
    seems aimed just at Mac users and (some) graphic designers.\r\nA more \"inclusive\"
    declaration could've been something like font-family: Helvetica, 'Helvetica Neue',
    'Neue Helvetica', 'Nimbus Sans', 'Nimbus Sans L', Arial, sans-serif;"
