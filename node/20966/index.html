I remember seeing this phrase (No revolution ever used a serif) on a poster or as a graffiti and I really can't find out what it was.
I don't know if it would be worth opening a discussion about revolutions, propaganda, regimes and typography, but for sure I'd appreciate any hints who could help me find out if I really read it somewhere or I just dreamt about it (which of course would be much cooler).
Thanks a lot.

		<div class="commentbody">Absolutely. But we have forgotton what it was about, which was primarily unfair taxation with freedom of religion thrown in. We pay a lot more taxes now than the original reason for the revolt.

Income tax was instituted in America as a "temporary" measure to pay for World War I. Before that the federal government was run on sales tax.

Daylight savings time was another temporary measure instituted in World War I. Both of these temporary measures have stood the "permanent" test of time…

		<div class="commentbody">>primarily unfair taxation

The saying 'no taxation without representation' captures it more accurately. 

While overtaxation was a grievance, there were many others. The Declaration of Independence says, "The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. ...A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people."

The rebellion was equally about the 'usurpations' as about 'injuries': They wanted establish self-govenance, which the founders saw as necessary to a better and more just society. 

The Declaration of Independence says: "Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." It also says that the colonies had repeatedly warned England "of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us." 

It was because they saw democratic self government as the only long term solution to avoiding tyranny and establishing a better and more just society that they took up arms in the ultimately successful rebellion. 

The American Revolution is most associated with Caslon typeface, as the Declaration of Independence was printed in it for distribution. Benjamin Franklin also printed mainly in Caslon, though late in life he championed Baskerville's typeface.    </div>

Do you think this is really true, Tim? I think that the Protestant Reformation (which did lead to several bloody revolutions in late Renaissance Germany, even if only inadvertantly) was started by the printed word. It was printing that allowed Martin Luther's works to spread so quickly.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting question. What does start a revolution? Maybe print just allowed for smaller fires to be fed until they became revolutions... there certainly have been many would-be revolutions that in the end just weren't.

I also tend to think that print itself was a revolution, but that is using the word revolution in a broader sense than in, say, the French Revolution.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, printing somehow started its own revolution.
Italian historiography also uses 1455 to mark the end of Middle Ages and the beginning of Renaissance period.

I was thinking more that it might refer to slogan written on walls, which I seriously doubt could be using serifs unless someone from this forum is called up to the job.
I find brilliant the idea of having it <em>as an advertising slogan for a sans serif</em>

A curiosity: the equivalent of sans serif for Chinese characters (Hei) had his birth from the use of squared brushes to write slogans.</div>
