body: "I'm currently working on a Certificate of Achievement. Nothing fancy, but I
  wanted to set it up so that the name, date and training could be entered by the
  provider. I know that you can set up PDFs to have Text Input areas, but have no
  experience doing this. \r\n\r\nCan you set the fields up in Illustrator (CS2) or
  InDesign (CS2) and then output to PDF, or do you create the PDF and add the \"interactive\"
  fields. I'm looking for some guidance if anyone has any, point to a tutorial would
  be fine as well. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any replies. Hopefully someone has
  an answer. "

  body: "I prefer to create the PDF and add the field(s) -- this used to be the only
    way you could do this (in PageMaker) and, to be honest,  I haven't checked to
    see if you can export it entirely from InDesign.  Wouldn't surprise me though....\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, even if you could do it from within Illustrator or InDesign, I'd still
    want to go in with Acrobat to check and tweak if necessary."

  body: In Acrobat Pro under Tools there is Advanced Editing, where there is at least
    a text field tool (and perhaps some other handy ones).

    body: "Absolutely.  Once you create the text box (Tools, Advanced Editing, Text
      Field Box), you can double-click on it, select Appearance, and it lets you define
      font, size, colour, etc.  \r\n\r\n(Of course, it presumes that whatever you
      define is also on the computer that is opening the pdf: you can't select Snell
      Roundhand if it isn't installed.)"

  body: Yes, there's an appearance section for font and size, at least, and a lot
    of other features. I suggest you give it a try and play a bit, see what it can
    do.

    up it's sleeves.
