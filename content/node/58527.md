  me off.  i thought it was franklin gothic or helvetica but the w seems too condensed
  although it maybe the perspective"

  body: "Those are not great diagnostic letters for an ID. Seems like many sans fonts
    might work, but I scanned MyFonts looking for 'humanist' sans fonts with a somewhat
    closed S. Depending on how obsessive you are about exactness, you might be able
    to use [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/protimient/travis/|Travis]]. The S is a
    bit more closed than your sample, but the W is relatively narrow and the M is
    straight-sided. Those three letters are about all you've shown that can be used
    as a filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
