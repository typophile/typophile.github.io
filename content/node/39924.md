body: "Hi, \r\nI'm in a bit of a quandary, and could do with some advice.\r\nI'm doing
  various leaflet / flyer marketing pieces.\r\nThe company's logo uses Eurostile,
  and have used Eurostile in various things like signage in the past.\r\n\r\nSo I
  was thinking to keep continuity, of using Eurostile for headings etc, and mixing
  it with another font for the body text.\r\nI'm In a number of minds over what font
  to contrast with Eurostile,  sans, or serif. maybe a 'super family' with both?\r\nI've
  looked at fonts like Melior, and ITC Fenice, which have similarities with Eurostile,
  but them seem a bit sharp and mean.\r\nI suppose the feel should represent quality
  and sincerity, friendly and inviting. \r\n\r\nOr should I scrap the idea of using
  the font in their identity, \r\nand just choose one font with a good range of weights,
  and use that throughout, for titles and body text etc. ?  \r\n\r\nAny ones suggestions
  of what direction they think would be good to go would be very much appreciated.
  \r\nToby"

  body: "I like Melior and I think it's a great text companion for Eurostile; I probably
    would have thought to suggest it even if you hadn't mentioned it. I definitely
    find it a friendly and inviting face myself... but as mentioned I like it so I'm
    probably not being impartial.\r\n\r\nNot so fond of Fenice as a text face, but
    a lot has to do with the letterspacing, leading and size. I bet a good designer
    could set with it and I'd go, \u201CHmmm, that's nice!\u201D when I looked at
    the page (probably by using wider spacing than I'm generally fond of). I have
    the same reservations about Bodoni but I've seen it and liked it for text without
    consciously paying attention to how it was set.\r\n\r\nI would prefer not to pair
    Eurostile headings with a sans text face given the choice, but I've seen it used
    with Helvetica in the past and it didn't suck - the very blandness of Helvetica
    means it doesn't fight with Eurostile's characteristics. So how about Neue Helvetica
    45? Might be worth giving Optima a shot too, you might like them together.\r\n"

  body: "I think it's a good idea to keep their identity going - see if you can work
    the Eurostile into the materials. Altho I don't think of Eurostile as particularly
    \"friendly and inviting\". I think your instinct to mix it with a serif font is
    a good one, both because they're less likely to fight and because serifs are a
    little more friendly.\r\n\r\nSomething else by Novarese (you mentioned Fenice)
    is a good way to start. Maybe look at the font Novarese? Altho both it and Fenice
    lack italics. Belizio?"

  body: "Thanks for your replies.\r\nYeah, I don't think eurostile is particularly
    friendly either, I wouldn't have used it had i not inherited it. \r\nBut hopefully
    i can work it in and still get a good result. \r\n\r\nI keep coming back to melior,
    because it does work nicely with eurostile, but I just feel it maybe looks a bit
    rigid?\r\nI quite like belizio, that seems more friendly. Does that seem a fair
    assessment? \r\n\r\n "

  body: I don't know, I think Eurostile is quite friendly looking compared within
    its own genre. It has a softness and refinement that I find lacking in some more
    recent square-sided sans faces.

  body: "I think you should keep the identity, and try to do not mix typographies.
    However if you \"have to\" use any other typography I would suggest a serif, at
    leas to look for an excuse/change... But still thinking that 1 typography in a
    artwork is more than enough. Keep it simple... as Bruno Munary would say: \"design
    is simplifying no complicating\". But is just a personal agreement.\r\n\r\nnarcis
