  DIN / Helvetica, respectively.  What are these type design graphics called?  Are
  they purchase-able in larger format (i.e., poster size)?  I just think they look
  really sweet.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FFDIN_5866.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/300px-HelveticaSpecimenCH_5013.svg.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help, y'all!"

    other specimens I've seen.

  body: Thanks for the tip, dave.  I'll agree they're a bit "boring," but I really
    enjoy the simplicity / layout / color schemes for these two.  Not to mention the
    fonts, themselves.
