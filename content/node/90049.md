body: "<p>This has been a long time coming. It\u2019s old, but much of it still applies,
  and I am truly amazed at how people are still making the same mistakes we made a
  decade ago. Taken from <a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/designmistakes.html\">Jakob
  Nielsen\u2019s Alertbox, October 3, 2005: Top Ten Web Design Mistakes of 2005</a>.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n2.
  Non-Standard Links  Following are the five main guidelines for links:\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Make obvious what\u2019s clickable: for text links, use colored, underlined text
  (and don't underline non-link text).  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Differentiate visited and unvisited
  links.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Explain what users will find at the other end of the link,
  and include some of the key information-carrying terms in the anchor text itself
  to enhance scannability and search engine optimization (SEO). <strong>Don\u2019t
  use \u201Cclick here\u201D or other non-descriptive link text</strong>.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Avoid JavaScript or other fancy techniques that break standard interaction techniques
  for dealing with links.\r\n\r\nIn particular, don\u2019t open pages in new windows
  (except for PDF files and such).</p> <p>Links are the Web's number one interaction
  element. Violating common expectations for how links work is a sure way to confuse
  and delay users, and might prevent them from being able to use your site.\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nFor
  example, instead of linking \u201CI just came across an interesting Kickstarter
  project. For more information, <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2094022925/gremolata-and-cancellaresca-milanese\">click
  here</a>\u201D (which provides the user with no information as to where they are
  going to end up without additionally reading the words around the ambiguous word
  \u201Chere,\u201D try:\r\n\r\nI was doing a bit of reading, and I came across <a
  href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2094022925/gremolata-and-cancellaresca-milanese\">an
  interesting Kickstarter project: Gremolata & Cancellaresca Milanese</a>. A graphic
  design project in new York, NY, by Russell Maret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201C<em>Those who

    site.

    a novice it doesn't matter if the rule was made last month or 20 years ago, it's
    all new to them. \r\n\r\nIf I decide to learn carpentry, I may make some of the
    same mistakes my grandfather did 50 years ago when he was learning it. I'm a beginner
    making beginner mistakes.\r\n\r\n(Of course if the person has previously been
    taught the rules and then ignores them, that's a different matter.)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree with Joshua Langman and don't think the web is made for absolute
    rules of right and wrong. I still use a \"click here\" from time to time depending
    on the situation. I have a great client that's a rural telephone company that
    has customers just now experiencing email and web for the first time. While it
    may be understood that everyone knows how web links work, and that \"click here\"
    isn't necessary, that can be an erroneous assumption. The rules of right and wrong
    depend on the situation and the audience. That overt call to action is needed
    for that audience.\r\n\r\nI'm reminded of how when CSS came out and it was declared
    that tables were never to be used any more. I then got several Excel spreadsheets
    that had to be put on the web. It took me awhile to get the \"no tables\" thing
    out of my head and realize in this situation tables ruled. "

    \"rules\" without any understanding of the why or when the various rules are to
    be applied \u2014 that actually goes for design in general. FWIW, when I got going
    with designing the Excel tables, I was blown away at how wonderful the CSS for
    tables/tablular data are.\r\n\r\nJens Kutilek, you have a fine point too. We are
    entering the Post-PC world where all rules are due to be rewritten yet again. "

    everything. That said, links are usually meant to draw attention, so if that's
    a bad thing, perhaps that's the wrong place to be putting links (perhaps a side
    bar or footnotes would make more sense in that context)"
