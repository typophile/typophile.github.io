  FontExplorer X</strong>\r\n\r\n[[Linotype|Linotype's]] FontExplorer X (FEX) is a
  free font management tool, which includes an integrated font store. Users of FEX
  may purchase fonts via this store if they so choose (unlike traditional internet
  font shopping, fonts purchased via FEX will be directly installed in the font manager,
  for easier activation and deactivation).\r\n\r\nAs of this writing (April 11, 2006),
  FontExplorer X is currently available just for MacOS X 10.3.9 and higher. A PC version
  is in the works.\r\n\r\nThe Font Store within FontExplorer X (April 11, 2006) only
  contains [[Linotype]] fonts. However, [[Linotype]] is currently making agreements
  with many third party foundries, so that their fonts will soon appear in the store
  as well.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Nota Bene</em></strong>\r\nDuring the late 1990s, [[Linotype]]
  created a product called the [[FontExplorer]], which was a catalog plus CD. On the
  CD, customers could sift through Linotype's font library by using subjective keywords
  and descriptive terms. FontExplorer was and is an aide for those looking to find
  specific fonts. In 2004, [[Linotype]] placed the contents of the CD online for free
  download (c. 180 MB). By that time, over 1 million catalogs and CDs had been distributed.\r\n\r\n[[FontExplorer]]
  and FontExplorer X are two different products that both aim to help font users find
  the right fonts for their needs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27616\">Windows
