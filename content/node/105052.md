  body: Most probably a custom logo work by [[http://dnco.com/carlton-sw1.html|dn&co]].
    Looks like they mixed [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avenir|Avenir]] (mainly
    because of /C and /R) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]] (/S
    looks pretty dead on) then beveled it. This [[http://www.carltonsw1.com/downloads/CarltonSW1_Brochure.pdf|PDF]]
    embeds the original woodmark as vector, no font.
