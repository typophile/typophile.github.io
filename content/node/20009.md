  design a website for a large commercial printing company.\r\nBig facility, lots
  of beautiful print.\r\nThey are starting to ramp up their web-to-print abilities,
  but work conventional commercial printing with great success.\r\n\r\nI am looking
  for inspiration of a font in the navigation and body at this point.\r\n\r\nLove
  to hear any feedback!\r\n\r\nAnd, thanks for your patience.\r\n\r\n\r\nwnf"

  body: "If its a HTML based website you are / may be pretty limited in choosing typefaces
    for the body copy. You have to rely on those that come pre installed on most computers.
    To try and compare the most common types for web, you may want to check the fabulous
    <a href=\"http://typetester.maratz.com\" target=\"_blank\">typetester.maratz.com</a>.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the navigation / menus, you may want to consider types that stay legible and
    'clean', even when used / presented very small, and on screen. <em>( Like one
    of those greyscale bitmap / pixel fonts. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"

      bring more \"flavor\" into the typography.\r\n\r\nDefinitely, even with css,
      conventional web design would limit me much greater."

    the company using now, typeface wise, for their printed materials? Dont they have
    any 'corporate types' or just typefaces they use regularly for all their communication,
    advertising and what else?\r\n\r\n<em>( There were several threads / discussions
    about typefaces suitable for on screen usage and display, on Typophile, in the
    past, so you may find something within those. For example: I recommended '<a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/catalog/critter/index.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">( New ) Critter</a>', from LettError, previously. A typeface
    originally designed for MTV as their on air display type. )</em>\r\n\r\n<em> >

    example, 'Futura' throughout their printed matter, you may want to consider using

  body: "Point well taken.\r\n\r\nI think I do have a bit more leverage as they \"really,
    really\" want to kill the old look of their pr brochure pieces.\r\n\r\nI am definitely
    looking to see if I can find another pair of typefaces to bring into the mix,
    or start anew.\r\n\r\nBut, as you mentioned, Futura isn't a bad choice... sans
    serif, web friendly.\r\nHmmm, I am still up to the challenge to find some alternatives.\r\n\r\n:-)"

  body: "wnf, IMHO the first thing you have to make sure here is that you're not crossing
    a rebranding border. I'm not sure the client would like such turns, even though
    a web site is completely different media than print brochures.\r\n\r\nFutura is
    really quite adequate here, considering one of your introductory sentences: <cite>\"They
    are starting to ramp up their web-to-print abilities, but work conventional commercial
    printing with great success\"</cite>.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, a flash web
    site is not what you/they/anybody should aim for these days."
