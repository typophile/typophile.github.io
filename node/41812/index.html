  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm doing a logo for a community association, the focus groups said the residents most identify with the parks and river in the area so I tried using a leaf to represent the nature. It's a mixed residential type ares, with quite a bit of over development in high rise apartments in the 80's. 

This is a quick sketch of the idea I was going for. 

Comments appreciated.

		<div class="commentbody">The first issue is definitely complication.  There's no real center or focus to the logo with the buildings, leaf and water.  That doesn't mean there can't be a focus, but right now they are three separate elements that aren't working together.

The second issue, and more important to me, is that none of the sketches are unique enough to serve as an identifier for your community.  Any leafy suburb with a creek could use those logos.  Maybe you should try combining those pieces with something typographic, like the K or a KL monogram that would be more unique to your town.</div>

Perhaps use a leaf that comes from a native tree, or an architectural element from your town. I would also recommend that you start working with your type element at this early design stage. Try to get the type and image to work together. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">If there no trees to speak of in this area...  By all means don't put one in the logo.  It will ring as a falsehood, and compromise the brand.  But since you say that "the residents most identify with the parks and river in the area so I tried using a leaf to represent the nature", then leave the computer and go take a walk.  Collect leaves.  Post pencil/pen/watercolor sketches, and then return to the computer when you've refined your idea.   If the logo is inspired by the community, then it will ring far truer.

		<div class="commentbody">Central Park uses a primarily typographic logo, the Parks department however uses the maple leaf. Personally I think that's as generic as what I have going here.


I don't think I ever said there were no trees, just not one specific kind that can be pinned down as this suburbs tree.
I've been to the parks in question, I live next door, and have done sketches in the park of different things, this is one of the sketches. Based on White Elm, Hackberry, Manitoba Maple and Linden in the area. Thanks for the suggestion though.

In general, the elements are working against each other, as if they were rigid and could only be superimposed over each other at different scales. Use your drawing skills to combine the leaf with the water in a unified shape. Consider that in a way the buildings are repeating the land/earth part of the equation already represented by the leaf. Simplify.</div>
