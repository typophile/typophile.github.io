body: "Newbie post. I've been asked by a client about the Kindle format so I thought
  I'd query the collective.\r\n\r\nI've read that only .TXT and .AZW are readable
  on the Kindle. That seems odd, but understandable. Has anyone read anything which
  they've bookmarked which explains the conversion process and/or how it looks?\r\n\r\nUpdate:
  I am aware of the <a href=\"http://dtp.amazon.com/mn/signin\">Digital Text Platform</a>
  area on Amazon. "

    AZW files from the Amazon store:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#File_formats\r\n\r\nWith
    some tinkering, you can convert protected MOBI/PRC files into protected AZW files;
    they're essentially the same format:\r\n\r\nhttp://igorsk.blogspot.com/2007/12/mobipocket-books-on-kindle.html\r\n\r\nMy
    favorite hidden Kindle feature is turning off the justification with J when viewing
    the font size list.\r\n\r\nI guess none of that really answers your question,
    but if you'd like to send me files to test on the Kindle I'd be happy to.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks. :^)\r\n\r\nI should add that my client would be selling their books
    on Amazon for the Kindle. (If they do decide to do so I mean.) I'll assume they
    want to do it in a way which protects the text from people copying it. Can you
    open and edit the AZW files?"
