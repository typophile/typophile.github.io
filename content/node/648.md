body: 'The 2003 Bulwer-Lytton contest winners have been posted and typography has
  entered the canon. From the web site: &#34;Entrants are challenged to submit bad
  opening sentences to imaginary novels.&#34; The runner-up reads as follows: <BR>
  <BR>The flock of geese flew overhead in a &#34;V&#34; formation - not in an old-fashioned-looking
  Times New Roman kind of a &#34;V&#34;, branched out slightly at the two opposite
  arms at the top of the &#34;V&#34;, nor in a more modern-looking, straight and crisp,
  linear Arial sort of &#34;V&#34; &#40;although since they were flying, Arial might
  have been appropriate&#41;, but in a slightly asymmetric, tilting off-to-one-side
  sort of italicized Courier New-like &#34;V&#34; - and LaFonte knew that he was just
  the type of man to know the difference.  <BR> <BR>John Dotson &#40;U.S. Naval Officer&#41;

    <BR> <BR>I wonder though, what would a similar type of contest be for us types?
