  Ressources sections be available ? Before the launch of this new version, there
  was some very interesting content in these sections.\r\n\r\n- Bitmap fonts grid,
  etc.\r\n- The project of the \"traveling book\" where you had to create a page and
  then send the book to someone else (hey, I was on the list of people wishing to
  receive it ! i'm stil VERY interested !)\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have more
  info on when these will be online ?\r\n\r\nThanks so much,"

  body: "I can fully appreciate the time it must take to keep Typophile going. Volunteer
    efforts are often taken for granted by the public as a given. Typophile is a great
    resource and the fact that it exists is reason enough to thank the people behind
    it...often and with sincerity. But they, like most of us, have day jobs and most
    likely devote their \"spare\" time to keeping Typophile up and running. I look
    forward to future updates to the site, but will allow it to happen when it can.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I am very interested in the status of the travelling book project. Who currently
    has one? Is anyone interested in setting up a tracking system for the books?"

    next step for Typophile. I joined around the time of the switch to this new version
    (about a year ago) and it was all full of exciting new features and what-nots
    then it sorta petered out. I didn't know it was a side project worked on during
    the few free wee hours of ultra busy designers. Please accept my humble apologies...
    I do enjoy Typophile so. \r\n\r\n"
