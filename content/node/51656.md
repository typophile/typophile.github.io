  still on the drawing board on this one, just wanted to know if you guys like the
  direction or think I should abandoned ship. Thanks for all the feedback.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/christietypophile_5320.png]"

    is similar to many out there right now (eeeh WalMart..?) it is definitely friendly

    aside, I don't think this is a logo yet. It's just and exploration of forms.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: "The type looks decent, but I feel that the mark is too generic.  To me it
    communicates nothing, and the closest I get to a meaning is 'community', but that's
    because shapes in a circle make me think of Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nDo you have any other
    graphic ideas?  I'd love to see some other ideas explored.\r\n\r\nWhat is your
    strategy?  What 2 or 3 words are you trying to communicate with the logo (knowing
    that let me see how well you're achieving your goal when I see it)\r\n\r\nEither
    way, best of luck, keep going at it!"

  body: "what i see is that you could take the glyph you have and move towards turning
    it into an abstract object representing something from childhood - I see a jack
    in your object.\r\n\r\nIf it was to be a community concept -  then consider moving
    away from symmetry and see if the elements when overlapping make a more unified
    form. just don't use four overlapping hands...  ;)\r\n\r\nRemember A good logo
    Identity mark should also make sense when sent with a fax machine... also the
    use of color should not be the only source of unity between the glyph and the
    text elements. . . Mimic the fonts style in the glyph exaggerate a character in
    the name to be the repeating element in the glyph...\r\n\r\nYou will find that
    if you have at least three elements that unify the two parts of the logo you will
    have a solid design that your client would be proud to pay you for.\r\n\r\njust
    my thoughts . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I am working on strengthening the mark and will post some new concepts in the
