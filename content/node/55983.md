  body: "I'm a huge fan of <a href=\"http://www.posttypography.com\">PostTypography</a>.
    Not so much of a blog, but a portfolio with funky yet functional navigation. It's
    a nice breather from a lot of traditional computer rendered typography treatments.
    I've always been keen to getting off the box and hand rendering some letters,
    but it's much tougher than it seems. Practice I guess...\r\n\r\nJohan Vilchez"
