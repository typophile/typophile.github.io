  feedback on this logo I have recently created. The logo is for a chain of porn/adult
  stores starting up here in Sydney. The brief was quite tricky, as it needed to steer
  away from your usual sleazy, in your face porn store identity. The feeling with
  this, is that is more of a superstore chain (KMart, Walmart, Bunnings Warehouse
  etc.) It needs to convey the feeling of a trust worthy, responsible, friendly and
  long lasting brand.\r\n\r\nevergreen"

  body: I really don't like what you did to your M -- too narrow and distorted. Try
    to make it harmonise with the rest of the characters, and maybe check that A as
    well. For the rest it's a very good start.

  body: 'Why does this logo have such a hard, industrial feel to it? I mean, I suppose
    "hard" is appropriate for porn, but this looks much more like branding for a large
    industrial machinery manufacturer than a "trust worthy...friendly" porn shop.
    The Walmart logo works because it suits the consumer''s clouded idea of what they''ll
    get there: simple, no-nonsense stuff with an upbeat (mind-numbing) atmosphere
    introduced by the goofy star. Same with KMart, espeically with their current design:
    clean, simple, even childlike. In either case, "friendly" is gushing in those
    logos, which is why they''re so clunky and awkward,  somehow inspiring trust,
    or at least diminished suspicion. Your logo makes me feel like that schmaltzy,
    generic super-store thing is the concept, but the atmosphere you''re attempting
    to invoke just isn''t executed successfully.'

  body: "Also looks very retro, from the type effect and the colors. I'm getting a
    1950s feel. Is that deliberate/desirable?\r\n\r\nT"

    body: "Just a few responses to questions asked:\r\n\r\nReason that I chose to
      oblique the first letter of each word was because it felt quite dull and lifeless
      without any kind of energy/movement. The brand has to breed a little bit of
      excitement/energy as is the way with the industry. The 'industrial' feel that
      has been mentioned came about with the idea that this brand needs to ooze power,
      commitment and something that will be around forever. As far as a 'retro' feel,
      I dont see this at all. The nature of the logo needs to be put in context before
      a judgement like that could be successfully made.\r\n\r\nBut overall, thank
      you all for your comments/ideas. "

    \u2018industrial\u2019 feel that has been mentioned came about with the idea that
    this brand needs to ooze power, commitment and something that will be around forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    'industrial' feel has a bit of a 'have bob slap together a sign and we'll hang
    it in the window' feel. Meaning that it seems to be doing the opposite of what
    you want. If you want the wal-mart/k-mart vibe, the key is simplicity of decoration
    IMHO. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I see this as more of a identity for a toolhire firm, the font and colours
    don't really give the qualities that you are looking for. Furthermore, I question
    that the qualities that you mention are really those that an audience will want
    from a porn shop.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to stay with the design you have you should
    be aware that the shadow of the bar of the T in ADULT is going to be lost at small
    sizes and the lower right of the A has gone missing in the distortion. The shadows
    are also causing a problem because of the colours they represent as having two
    lightsources.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would suggest that you look for another approach,
    maybe consider that women visit porn shops as well, I would look for an elegant
    seriffed font and present it in a simple, uncomplicated manner.\r\n\r\nTim"
