  and <a href="http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/RecentReleases/2006/Dante+Pro.htm">Dante
  Pro</a>? Just the character set?

  body: "Since you are showing two different foundries, the matter is a bit more complicated.
    Adobe typically uses the term pro to mean an OpenType face with a more extended
    character set and features. Thomas Phinney can probably give you a more specific
    definition of Adobe's scheme. Monotype may not use Pro to mean the same thing
    as Adobe.  If Adobe has an arrangement with Monotype to sell Monotype's Dante
    under its own name, the outlines may be the same for the two versions. Hopefully,
    Thomas will see your post and shedsome light on the matter for you.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "STD basically means that what was once Postscript is now Opentype. There
    are no added niceties. For instance, if you compare <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=430046\">Dante
    Pro (Regular)</a> from Fonts.com and <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/DNTQ/F_DNTQ-10005000.html\">Dante
    STD (regular)</a> from Adobe.com you can see that Fonts.com has smallcaps. Also,
    Adobe has created a very nice <a href=\"javascript:popup('../../info/glyphs.html%23stdr')\">set
    of icons</a> which designate what is included with the chosen font. It is important
    to note that you really should click to each font to make sure what is included.
    Fonts.com is a quagmire and I really can't tell you more. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dantestdincl_4699.png]"

  body: 'Monotype''s "Pro" designation is not very different from Adobe''s; it would
    be messy if Monotype chose the same name to mean something different. The new
    Dante Pro fonts include small caps, OSFs, superior letters and figures, inferior
    figures, superior money symbols, broad European language support, fractions, and
    OpenType code for accessing all these (and more). The Roman font of this new package
    even includes the Titling caps previously available as a separate titling font. '
