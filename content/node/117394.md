  body: "Letters similar to the lower case are found in a variety of blackletter fonts
    including Engravers Old English http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/engravers-old-english-mt/
    which also has a similar _A_ , if you clip off the little flag on the lhs stroke.
    The _O_ is an enlarged _o_.\r\nDon"
