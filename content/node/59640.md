body: "Hi there, since I've become involved with the fine art of typography, I've
  stumbled into some great looking historical types which, in many opinions, dind't
  receive the appropriate digital version yet - or haven't been digitized at all.
  Here are my first choices:\r\n\r\n1. The great VAFFLARD \"First Manner\" type -
  a more humanistic cut on the neoclassical genre. Bill Troop worked on it in the
  Nineties and has been so kind to show me his versions, both in the display and text
  size. We've talked about it one year ago in this thread:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/47453\r\n\r\nI
  really hope Bill can get to a full working version, someday.\r\n\r\n(In the meantime,
  I'd suggest to take a look at his recently released Didot Display http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/didot-display/
  and Didot Headline http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/didot-headline/, two
  titling types in the same vein).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. FONTANA, designed by Giovanni Mardersteig
  for the Collins dictionary in 1936 - a variation on Baskverille. A small example
  can be seen here: http://www.typotheque.com/articles/microtypography_designing_the_new_collins_dictionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.
  DANTE, again by Mardersteig. The existing digital version is good, but it seems
  to lack the \"presence\" of the original metal version, which can be seen in this
  Flickr set by Florian Hardwig: http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2402240423/\r\n\r\n4.
  CALEDONIA, by W.A. Dwiggins. The \"New Caledonia\" version and the Bistream Transitional
  511 (I had the chance to test the latter) seems too weak and miss old style figurals."

    digitizing them. Don't wait another minute. Get to to it man!

  body: You may be interested in new, top-quality digital versions of these faces,
    but I doubt there is a market for them to justify the amount of work that would
    be required to do the job "properly".

  body: "Nicola -- \r\n\r\nI'm not really at liberty to discuss a lot of details,
    but I can say that I'm working on a restoration of Caledonia for Monotype Imaging/Linotype.
    Progress is sporadic and moving at something of a snail's pace right now (my fault),
    but it is in process.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: To be "properly" digitized, we will expect  at least four grades of at least
    four optical sizes :-)

  body: Great to hear that, Kent. I'm sure you'll do a nice job. And it's good to
    know that Fontana will be released next year by MacRhino. Unfortunately, Stamperia
    Valdonega doesn't offer their font for sale - they set their own (or your) books
    with them, but they don't license them.
