body: "Hi all, I'm looking for some help in the direction of developing my personal
  identity and wanted to get some typeface thoughts.\r\n\r\nMy renamed portfolio site
  will be figdigital, fig- being the shortened version of my last name and the -digital
  suffix being something vague enough to encompass all my design interests. I'm wanting
  to develop something that will appeal to my range of clients but lean towards the
  edgy side (I do work with some music clients and may be doing a good bit more) and
  be flexible enough to use in a variety of mediums.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fd_type_5525.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nI've
  spent hours sketching ideas with little to show, then recently ran across FF Disturbance
  and really love some of the letterforms (image above). The \"fig\" in particular
  really grabs me, I love the open letterform of the \"g\" and feel that it's really
  unique. When combined with \"digital\" set in the same face, however, it seems to
  be a bit too much visually and loses it's distinctiveness. I've been playing with
  the idea of some kind of a mark to use with this, but I feel like the typeface needs
  to be worked out first.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on possibly combining typefaces with this
  or other thoughts on direction for the logo in general? I've stared at it for so
  long that I'm needing some fresh opinions. Thanks for any thoughts.\r\n"

  body: "Not a problem Stefan.\r\n\r\nDan, thanks for the comments. Any other thoughts
    on how to approach this? I've made several attempts at a strictly typographic
    logo but everything tends to come out looking a bit...unfinished, for lack of
    a better term.\r\n"

  body: "Christopher,\r\n\r\nMaking your own identity is sometimes really hard work.
    Having to play the role of the designer and the the \"client\" at the same time
    might not always be optimal. If you feel stuck, why don't you ask some of your
    graphic designer friends to have a go on this?\r\n\r\nAnyway, good luck.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    about it a bit, but it's the sort of thing that I feel I really need to do myself.
    So it's back to the drawing board...any other ideas or advice welcome."
