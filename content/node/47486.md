  body: VOLT is still supported on XP. Dan Reynolds went with Vista as he's making
    a Hindi font and wanted access to latest Indic font shaping engines. What non-Latin
    are you taking on?

  body: "Eben, perhaps what Sii hints at is that its best to define your brief <strong>before</strong>
    you pick software configurations. Since you won't \"officially\" (hehe\u2026)
    define your brief at Reading until November/December, there is no need to lock
    yourself into to anything now. It isn't a good idea to try to \"start early\"
    on your project anyway, as things may change once you hit the ground in the department
    and see all of the resources available.\r\n\r\nBesides, who knows what technological
    changes might come to the field between now and whenever you need to implement
    what you need to implement?\r\n\r\nI licensed Vista and Office while I was writing
    my first essay over the Christmas break. I would have waited longer, but there
    was no other way to typeset Indic fonts properly on my Mac (which was the topic
    of my essay!). I didn't use my PC partition again until June/July, when it was
    time to produce the font in VOLT. \r\n\r\nBut if I had done an Arabic font instead
    of a Devanagari one, I might have:\r\n1. licensed a copy of InDesign ME instead
    of InDesign\r\n2. started in VOLT earlier, since I could have properly tested
    my font then on my Mac side in InDesign ME along the way (instead of on Windows
    in Word 2007). This wasn't an option for me, since there is no \"InDesign South
    Asia\" or what have you.\r\n\r\nPaul also did a Devanagari, and he has XP. The
    version of VOLT that you need in order to write for the latest Indic shaping engine
    works on XP, too. I guess you'd just have to test on Vista as well as in Office
    2007 on XP\u2026 you could ask him right now at the conference.\r\n\r\nAs a Mac
    User who has always worked on secondary PC as well, I must add that I don't understand
    this \"oh no, let's stay with XP\" business from Windows users at all. Vista is
    a better OS, at least every way that I look at it. Which\u2014I must say\u2014is
    from a <em>type</em> POV. That is the future, and I don't want to go back to previous
    OS problems."

  body: "Thanks for the thoughful responses! \r\n\r\nWhile I was in class at Typecon,
    Adam showed me his setup which was a VM ware with a wide variety of flavors of
    Win and maybe other OSs. Most impressive. So what I have now is the VMware plus
    XP. If I need to (per the brief as you correctly point ) I will add additional
    software to this. Sadly I will only be able to get up to 3GB memory with my vintage
    17'' not the 4 he recommended but that will still be better than 2.\r\n\r\nSi,
    Dan,  I haven't decided what latin to take on. It might simply be Cyrillic for
    all I know. It is great to see how the parts all relate better. Thanks very much!
    \r\n\r\nManlio, I am sorry. My sympathies!"
