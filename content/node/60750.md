  hint as to the typeface used is that it's the same as good morning america all caps,
  bold... I already went through the questions/ checklist on http://www.identifont.com/identify.html
  \"identifont\" and the conclusion was that the font was \"arial\". The font I'm
  looking for is identical in every way that I can see EXCEPT an arial \"R\" has a
  curve to it where as the one I need (by today) does not, just a diagonal line. Any
  Educated guesses or other resources I should turn to?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n"

  body: The Bitstream version has the classic Avant Garde "R". The Linotype/Adobe
    version was apparently derived from the Multiple Master version that was created
    in the '90s. The "R" was redesigned so that it could blend between different weights.
    Not sure why one would retain that design if it's not Multiple Master. The original
    Linotype/Adobe version followed the classic design. <a href="http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=425892&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=32242&query=AVANT%20GARDE&SCOPE=Fonts">The
    "Pro" version on Fonts.com</a> shows the original "R" plus you get all the ligatures.
