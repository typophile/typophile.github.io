  without piracy.

  body: I think there are many approaches to web fonts. We have only just started
    to see the very beginnings of the solutions. Our web team is also working on this.
    who knows where it will wind up.

    project end up filed, ultimately, as noble experiments.\r\nEveryone will learn
    from them.\r\nKudos to anybody who tries to take this bull by the horns.\r\n"

  body: "There are just 2 ways to do it: You either give the customers the webfonts,
    or you give them a code and everything else is handled on the server of the webfonts
    provider. There is no other way to do it. So I was a little bit surprised about
    the hype around the \"revolutionary idea\" called Typekit. Richard and I (among
    others) are proposing this model for quite some time now. \r\n\r\nAbout the \"real
    fonts on Web sites without piracy\": It's just not possible! Sure, all these webfont
    services will use some sort of obfuscating, both for the download URLs and the
    font files itself, but in the end there is always a working font delivered to
    the browser. And any obfuscating can easily be bypassed or reversed. So as foundries
    we shouldn't fall for any promises about a \"secure webfont service\". \r\nWe
    should either accept the risk, or not take part in this development. But we shouln't
    wait for a magical solution to secure the fonts. It's not gonna happen. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    The company introduced a non-commercial end user license agreement, or EULA, that
    permits the use of fonts in the Embedded OpenType format on the Web. Intended
    to extend font choice for Web page design, the EULA requires no additional fee
    for use on a non-commercial Web site when licensing products from the company\u2019s
