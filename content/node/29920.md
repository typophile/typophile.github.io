  body: "Local job eh Duncan?\r\n\r\nI quite like them in that they're sufficiently
    different from each other; IMHO, Stempel Garamond is the best of the Garamonds
    that actually carry the name. I can see from reading the first few lines why you
    picked Maple for the headings \u2013 it looks like a grotesque that's been made
    with a pair of tin snips.\r\n\r\nBTW, Bringhurst recommends pairing Syntax with
    Stempel Garamond (p.106, paragraph two, of the second edition of 'The Elements
    of Typographic Style') but apparently the new Syntax Next is a <em>lot</em> more
    calligraphic than the old cut.\r\n\r\nGood luck with it."

    options.

  body: "Hmm, Maple with (Stempel) Garamond, i don't think it works.\r\n\r\nI would
    check out different Modern/Scotch Roman/Egyptienne. \r\nSomething like Corona,
    Excelsior, New Caledonia, Bookman Old Style, the Century Faces, Bell MT, Hoefler
    Text (or something quiet like Times Ten or an elegant Baskerville).\r\n\r\nT. "

  body: "Not an obvious pairing, but then they aren't directly paired in your sample,
    I mean if you were using Maple for an intro text paragraph or for tables, then
    I doubt they would work. In your example it works for me.\r\nTim"

  body: I personally like the combination of Tribute with Maple. They both share a
    kind of over-the-top attitude for their genre (if that makes any sense). I've
    also wondered how Storm's Hercules would look with Maple...

  body: I agree with Addison's description of Tribute and Maple, but I don't think
    you want two fonts of this sort in one layout, unless the content calls for it.
    Your page looks great.

  body: Maple is such a friendly typeface. It isn't as uptight as some of the other
    woody typefaces available. I think it adds character to the page and pulls Stempel
    up by the boot straps.
