  (there's a ton more on the mailer):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/exgg_3604.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
  not a font, it's all hand done - but to me it's\r\nstill so much more satisfying
  than calligraphy.\r\nBTW, that \"s\" makes me think it was done from\r\nmemory,
  and not copied from a font.\r\n\r\nIt's from a company called Exclusive Resorts,
  and\r\ntheir website has the same style going* although it\r\ndoesn't work nearly
  as well as on the mailer.\r\n\r\n* http://exclusiveresorts.com\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, is there any reason you seem to dislike calligraphy? \r\n\r\nI studied
    calligraphy for quite some time and find it's not only enjoyable, but a good way
    gain an understanding of both type and form. I know calligraphy is not in style
    like it was years ago, but I think there is still a solid place for it in the
    design world. There are a number of lettering artist and calligraphers who do
    beautiful work that is still contemporary.\r\n\r\nWhere I work I have to do both
    refined lettering/calligraphy and also very naive looking letters as in your sample.
    These days I do a lot more of the naive styles because the \"regular Joe\" style
    of handlettering is popular, but visually I like both ends of the spectrum when
    done in an appropriate context. \r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: "I think calligraphy can be beautiful and compelling. But faux type simply\r\nturns
    me on much more. That's just a personal preference - nothing more.\r\n\r\nBut
    also, practically speaking in this piece at least calligraphy\r\nwould have made
    it just-another-pretty-face, while faux type makes\r\nit much more novel and perhaps
    arguably more appropriate as well.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest asking them for a copy of
    that mailer - it's a very nice piece.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I had a look at the way they used in on the website. The flash portion on
    the left was handled very gracefully and had a more striking contrast. The heading
    on the top of the paragraph on the right side was not. I thought it looked a bit
    too bulky and tight for the space.\r\nOne of the things that I do find compelling
    about these faux type settings is when the designer uses it like as if it were
    fine type. The contrast it sets up is compelling. Some of the hand rendered faux
    type and scripts that Chris Sickels of Red Nose Studio does are wonderful. He
    does 3d illustration and his lettering compliments it well.\r\n\r\nhttp://rednosestudio.com/"

  body: "Mm, I really dig this. It also feels quite interesting and appropriate in
    the context.\r\n\r\nActually, I think this approach could well carry more of the
    design; it would be exciting to see them play with the concept some more. Like
    introducing an element of imperfect sketching to the photography, maybe. And I
    wish they'd set those beautiful letters bigger!*\r\n\r\n* On the web site, I mean."

    is to me too hrant. Every calligraphy-based typeface that comes out makes hand
    calligraphy more obsolete. Whether it is based on a font or not, hand lettering
    is supposed to have variations and imperfections just like our everyday handwriting.
    That's what makes it interesting and compelling. \r\n\r\nMy taste is for appropriate
    and beautiful communication. If that means using \"dumbed down forms\" then so
    be it. Sorry calligraphers, ITC Fine Hand put you out of the job.\r\n"
