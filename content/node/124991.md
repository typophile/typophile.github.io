  body: "Typewriters had their own typefaces which were not based on fonts of type.\r\nHowever,
    from shortly after typewriters became common, type foundries offered fonts that
    imitated the look of typewriter typefaces.\r\nFor example the American Typefounders
    Specimen Book and Catalog of 1923 offered fonts called Remington, Underwood, Smith
    Premier, Oliver, American, Repeating Reproducing and several others. See pages
    521 to 532. ATF 1923 can be read online. https://archive.org/details/1923AmericanTypeFoundersSpecimenBookCatalogue\r\nYour
    typescript sample is of reasonably good quality.\r\nIt can be compared to the
    samples in this and other old foundry specimen books.\r\nA project for someone
    with a little bit of time on their hands.\r\nNote that the online versions are
    fuzzy compared to the printed book. See comments at http://typophile.com/node/100507\r\nHowever
    if you can narrow it down to something in ATF 1923 that seems to be a match, I
    would be happy to post a crisper scan of the font in question\r\nNote that most
    of these typefaces are not available in a clean digital version or even in a grunge
    or dirty version.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
