<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I just want to send a thank you shout out to this forum. I had been trying to install FontExplorer X onto my new MacBook Pro (Leopard) and having odd permissions problems. I emailed Linotype with no reply. Then I did a search for FontExplorer and Leopard on typophile and found threads saying there had been a compatibility problem and that Linotype had issued an upgrade. I downloaded the new version and it works just fine. If not for this forum I'd be stewing (literally, it's going up to 100 degrees here today) and frustrated and possibly purchasing another font software out of desperation.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bravo Patty! This forum has saved my butt a time or two as well, Patty. You know you have friends here who know stuff and are willing to help.

<div class=commentbody>No reply at all from Linotype? On a technical installation question from a paying customer? I know that among the typophile regulars, there are a few representatives of competitive firms, and they will be a-shakin' their heads and saying, "Not with us!"
Hopefully. I also hope that those 100 degrees is not in centigrades.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's farenheit. I just did something I never do - let a client make a decision for me rather than schlep over to their offices in this heat. But a girl has to have priorities.
Chris - yes, I have received myriad InDesign tips from Linda and Tiffany among others. It was just so nice to be able to solve my problem so easily thru this forum.
Re Linotype - to be fair I sent the email over the weekend and they might be replying today or the next, but I was too impatient. I'm very eager to get the laptop functional so I can travel with it. It's so yummy. I got the lunchtray (17") with the high res screen and the first one they sent me was a lemon - flickery screen. This replacement machine seems fine but wow no dialup modem port. At my beach house that is actually how we get online. No cars neither but we do have indoor plumbing.</div>

Nah, not really. Up at the place in far western Ontario we still have to step out to "the little house behind the house." Not a problem.
& we don't even have a phone line up there, so the lunchtray laptop gets to stay home for a week or more. Swim & fish & read & walk. No typography. I can't wait until August.

<div class=commentbody>sounds heavenly, but my dialup connection does allow me to spend more time at the beach than otherwise. I can actually get some work done in the early hours of the day and then knock off after lunch and go to the beach. </div>

I have had some bad run-ins while "stepping out" in years prior.
