    Roman]]. It used to be available through Image Club Graphics collection. \r\nThe
    only legitimate revival/digitization I'm aware of are [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/hawthorn-lt|Hawthorn
    LT]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/denver|Denver TS]].\r\nI can
    also only relay suspicion about 'Berns' which is, to me, an illegal copy of Bernase
    Roman ITC."
