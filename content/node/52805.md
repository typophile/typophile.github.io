body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/review_6406.jpg]\r\n\r\n  Hi all,\r\nI
  am working on a new typeface which combines elements of early sans faces (Grotesque
  MT) and roman glyphic (Albertus).\r\n  All too often I use Grotesque MT as a sans
  text face and felt that I needed to make my own alternative (with an antique twist).\r\n\r\n
  \  Its in its early testing phase and so far I have made Regular, Semi-bold and
  Bold (although I started building the font from the semi-bold weight)\r\n\r\n   I'm
  not sure how to present it (or even <em>name</em> it) at this point but I'd like
  to get some critiques and comments on it. I am attaching a simple PDF for your collective
  consideration.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJ.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.alfa60.com/joe]]"

  body: Frankly, it looks like two faces. They're nice faces and you should finish
    both of them. But they're not integrating well.

  body: "Actually, thats kind of the idea.\r\nI enjoy the tension between the two
    aesthetics.\r\n\r\nwhen its used for extended text I think it achieves some kind
    of cohesion, have a look at this sample:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/txt_4547.jpg]"

  body: Joseph, can you post that longer sample as a PDF? The image is fuzzy. (In
    some cases, it looks like the beak of the r sometimes looks too long, and sometimes
    not.) I think the overall effect is very good.
