    Maybe I'm shooting in the dark here, but they're fairly similar, could work out.

  body: "Thanks for the help guys. \r\n\r\nAndreas - I said that I need to 'replicate'
    the sign, so I'm looking for fonts that people could suggest to do the trick,
    I'm not suggesting that the sign necessarily has anything to do with any digital
    fonts. It's semantics anyway, most people seemed to get the gist of what I was
    after. Sorry if that wasn't clear.\r\n\r\nFette Eygptienne looks like the best
    option, combined with lhf-hensler.\r\n\r\nThanks again guys.  "
