  font that was altered was OR a font that is similar in appearance. Need a complete
  alphabet in a hurry and don't have the time to create all the letterforms with the
  right amount of precision.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: A bit like Caslon Graphique perhaps, though a bit more pleasing to my eye.
    Then again there is no "a" which is what is ruining Caslon for me.
