body: " -,\r\nI find myself digging in one direction with this logo while I\u2019m
  not sure if I\u2019m on the right way.\r\nThe right way for me is consisted of aesthetic
  results but also of some logic that I think I miss here.\r\nSo I\u2019ll appreciate
  it if you can help me with the thinking process here\u2026 even if you don\u2019t
  like the final result, could you please give me a feedback on how you would approach
  this process.\r\nHere are my steps:\r\n1.\tThe type and mark is okay with me but
  I feel I need to give the \u2018flower\u2019 a slight change to make it more pop
  out. \r\n2.\tI\u2019m trying to add the word bistro and make it work together with
  the word pomegranate.\r\nfor this step I have these questions:\r\na. in general,
  do you think that it is necessary to add such words like bistro/ restaurants/ bar
  when the name of the place doesn\u2019t  refer them? In this current bistro place,
  they only have the word pomegranate in their sign, and somewhere close to the entrance
  door there is a neon sign that says \u2018bistro\u2019 \u2026 if someone drives
  by this place, he can\u2019t figure out what pomegranate is.\r\nb. when you have
  a name that is consisted of two words and one of the words is more important, how
  small should be the second word in relationship to the important one? I\u2019m guessing
  there are no firm rules but any logical tips will be great.\r\n3.\tThe font that
  I think will be a good choice for the word bistro should be: a serif font, less
  chubby than the pomegranate font, not italic, more \u2018classic\u2019 (bistros
  are dated from ~1800\u2026). Specifically to this project \u2013 am I on the right
  direction with defining a font?\r\n4.\tNow\u2026 I apologize in ahead for the next
  words\u2026 :-) - but, if I need to search a font, I\u2019m choosing sites like
  \u2018myfonts\u2019 and start going font by font to find a good match \u2013 should
  I be thrown to a tiny dark cell? How do you find a font? \r\n5.\tLast. Back to number
  1. I\u2019m trying to make a connection between the word bistro and pomegranate
  by finding a font that I can change the tip of its ascender in a way that will match
  the angle of the bottom of the flower. Maybe this will also make the flower pop
  out more.\r\n\r\nThis was a long one.\r\n\r\nElsi\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pomegranate_03_3862.png]"
