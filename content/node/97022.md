    body: "<blockquote>Really? Nothing?</blockquote>\r\nUh, you got an answer, dintya?\r\n\r\nAnyway,
      here is the promised example: 'frac' -- based on Tal Leming's <a href=\"http://talleming.com/2008/04/16/fraction-fever/\">Fraction
      Fever</a> discussion.\r\n\r\nfeature frac {\r\n    sub @figures slash' @figures
      by fraction;\r\n    sub @figures' fraction by @numerators;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe class
      '@figures' contains 'zero one two .. nine', and the first line will replace
      a simple default slash, preceded by a figure, with a proper 'fraction' slash.
      After that, individual figures should be replaced with superior/inferior forms,
      to create proper fractions.\r\nIt will work as expected if you manually inserted
      a fraction slash (and the first line will not be used). However, because all
      sub-tables are terminated a.s.a.p., this code will stop if the first line was
      executed! So in this case you have to force a sub-table below the first line
      to make sure the second line is evaluated as well.\r\n\r\nTal Leming's code
      doesn't specifically mention a sub-table, but I think standard behavior for
      feature compilers is to automatically create them when deemed necessary. In
      my example, the first line contains a 'fraction' on the <em>right</em> side
      of a substitution (target) and the second line on the <em>left</em> side (source),
      so to be able to process both rules, the compiler creates a sub-table at the
      second line."

  body: "Another application is the 'ignore' rule, which is not really a feature file
    keyword. It works like this: every \"ignore\" rule and its \"when not ignored\"
    counterpart appear in a sub-table of their own.\r\n\r\nignore [a e m n r u]' [
    @alpha ];\r\nsubst [a e m n r u]' by [a.end e.end m.end n.end r.end u.en];\r\n\r\nThis
    is meant to replace 'a', 'e', etc. with a swashed 'end' form, but of course <em>not</em>
    if another alphabetic character follows. So the first line is internally compiled
    to\r\n\r\nsubst  [a e m n r u]' [ @alpha ] by [a e m n r u];\r\n\r\n(i.e., it
    does \"nothing\"), and if this line <em>gets executed</em>, the next line is skipped.
    This particular sub-table must end after the next line, because there might be
    other lines that should be evaluated for the rest of the characters."

  body: "Thank's Karl and Theunis, that were the elaborate answers I was hoping for!\r\n\r\n<blockquote>subst
    [a e m n r u]' [ @alpha ] by [a e m n r u];\r\n(i.e., it does \"nothing\")</blockquote>\r\nThis
    is really enlightening. I've been using the \u2018ignore\u2019 keyword a few times
    and wasn't able to deduce such an evident fact.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(...) standard
    behavior for (feature) compilers is to automatically create them when deemed necessary.</blockquote>\r\nI
    realize my problems to understand OpenType's syntax mostly arise from the fact
    that the compiler generates subtables behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nAnother issue
    is that the \u2018subtable\u2019 command is only supported for class kerning,
    so one must set up an entirely new lookup to avoid line \u2018skipping\u2019.
    I wonder why it hasn't been implemented yet...\r\n\r\nOne thing that has clarified
    many of my doubts, re-reading Adobe's <em>OpenType Feature File Specification</em>,
    is the following part about chaining contextual substitution:\r\n<blockquote>The
    entire sequence of glyphs \u2013 prefix plus input plus suffix \u2013 must match
    in the current context for the rule to be applied. The match sequence is aligned
    to the current context by aligning the first glyph of the input sequence with
    the current glyph of the text being processed. If the rule is matched, then the
    current context moves the current glyph pointer ahead in the original text <em>by
    the length of the input sequence</em>. Note that in the FDK syntax, the entire
    context string (backtrack sequence + input sequence + look-ahead sequence) are
    all written in the text string order. This is worth emphasis, as inside the lookup
    rule, <em>the glyphs of the backtrack sequence are written in reverse order from
    the text to be matched.</em> </blockquote>\r\n\r\nI've emphasized the mind-blowing
    parts."

  body: "Possible further mind blowing-yet-enlightening may occur if you inspect a
    few ligature sets. I'd have to go through my font library to find a good example,
    but I think the text you copied from the specs also apply to sequences of \"ff\",
    \"ffi\", and \"ffl\" ligatures -- i.e., put them in the wrong order and/or without
    subtables, and some combo's will not work.\r\nPerhaps one of the OT-savvy techies
    can recall an appropriate thread from the past where one has to resort to manually
    inserting a 'subtable' clause in a GSUB feature.\r\n\r\nA propos: I am <em>assuming</em>
    OTF compilers automatically generate subtables for GSUB features, because I can't
    find a concrete reference to them as well (or these references are very oblique),
    and the fonts I have are positively brimming with them."
