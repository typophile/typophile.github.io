  then I used Trajan Pro to make the ID (my focus isnt logo at now).\r\n\r\nMy focus
  is that welcome text (Bem Vindo in portuguese) I can't find a font that looks great
  to do it with others element (logo, menu and that text above).\r\n\r\nSomebody can
  give me ideas? Thanks.\r\n\r\nPS: That Picture have the company's brands fotolia
  because I have not bought it. I'm just doing tests.\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n"

  body: "The best way is to use the same font for logo and headlines. But Trajan isn't
    the best choice for this. It's overused, even in Brazil.\r\n\r\nYou can achieve
    a very classy, elegant result with Arno Pro or Girando Pro. As these fonts have
    small caps, beautiful ligatures and ornaments, you can play with these variations
    in titles. Other options in this line: Williams Caslon, Documenta, Lyon Text.\r\n\r\nCalluna
    is beautiful, but maybe a bit playful for lawyers. Minion is great, but it's becoming
    very common (even ZH uses it). In a less traditional approach you can test Stuart
    or Expo Serif.\r\n\r\nYour client will need to combine numbers with its logo and
    headlines. So pay special attention to numbers (old style or lining, normal or
    Roman-like 1, etc.). Some fonts have the old style zero like a simple ring to
    differentiate from lowercase o, and this produces an uneven and ugly result (IMHO).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
    you need to keep Trajan for the logo, I second Nick's Pratt.\r\n\r\nIf you have
    choice about the sans, there are many options to scape the Arial/Helvetica world.
    Unit, Proxima Nova, Interstate, Info Text, Milo, The Sans, Gotham, Dobra and Flama
    are some I remember now.\r\n\r\nMeta and Meta Serif have excellent reputation,
    but I dislike their accents, a decisive question to Portuguese texts.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps."

    and it improves!'
