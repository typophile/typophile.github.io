body: I have to design two brochures, one in English, one in French for a client.  <BR>
  <BR>Can anyone tell me the average relative length of French copy Vs English? &#40;given
  the text is the same&#41;. Does it run longer or shorter and if so by how much?
  <BR> <BR>I know German can run much longer, but not sure about French <BR> <BR>thanks
  a lot <BR> <BR>s

  body: 'Going by &#34;Typographia polyglotta&#34;, about 10% more for French. But
    that&#39;s without accounting for translation &#34;laterality&#34;, which will
    increase the gain &#40;or decrease it if it&#39;s going from French to English&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>But there&#39;s a complication: different languages have different typographic
    needs/traditions. For example, Ladislas Mandel &#40;an old-school French font
    guy&#41; insists that French needs a small x-height. And this could in fact be
    a key to maintaining the set-length of the two versions of your text. <BR> <BR>Then
    there&#39;s linguistics: different languages use the letters in different proportions
    &#40;and some have accents&#41;, which means they use the Cartesian area differently.
    From what I remember of some quick measurements I once did, French has a greater
    vertical span than English. And this might be yet another key for you: the French
    might need to be set a hair smaller in point size, which would help combat the
    text length gain. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Excellent advice/links Hrant! <BR> <BR>Setting the french slightly smaller
    seems like a relatively painless solution to regain the extra space. However,
    I dont see how a smaller x-height would affect copy length - unless the you mean
    the leading could be tighter and therefore more lines per page?  <BR> <BR>I have
    been reading some interesting articles about newspaper fonts which have the same
    width setting for sans/serif/slab variations recently &#40;can&#39;t remember
    the links unfotunately&#41; enabling designers to change the style without affecting
    the flow. Do you know if there are fonts which apply the same idea to x-height?
    Interesting idea... <BR> <BR>thank you <BR> <BR>s

  body: '&#62; I dont see how a smaller x-height would affect copy length <BR> <BR>Well,
    besides the leading economy you mention, by smaller x-height I meant smaller x-height
    <i>body</i>, so it would take up less horizontal room too. But beware issues of
    apparent size: if the French ends up looking too small you might piss some people
    off. <BR> <BR>&#62; the same width setting <BR> <BR>You must be talking about
    Linotype Compatil. Except it&#39;s not really a news face. <BR>BTW, I call this
    approach &#34;uniwidth&#34; &#40;and I love it&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR>&#62;You must be talking about Linotype Compatil <BR> <BR>Hmm, i don&#39;t
    think so, I think it was from a smaller foundry &#40;maybe hoefler or something
    like that&#41;. I just looked through my web history to see if I could hunt it
    down &#40;no luck&#41; and realised I am averaging around 300 web pages per day
    - I really must do more work! <BR> <BR>I remember the specimen had 4 very different
    types on top of each other that had exactly the same horizontal width. Uniwidth
    seems like a very good term to describe it. <BR> <BR>s'

    talking about text fonts. &#40;BTW, the three fonts in my Daam Entity are uniwidth,
