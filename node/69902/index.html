Thanks for the screenshots. I was thinking more of the dreaded monster that is IE6. IE7 does not work either. 

There appear to be some fairly subtle alignment issues in 8 that I would prefer to "optimize."

I see the same in Safari, it's not FF, it's the Mac.

No just making the point that Mac FF is likely less than 1% of Web users. 

Anyway on my machine...

Chrome...

FF...
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FFWin_6743.PNG]

Safari...

Based on these I think IE9 looks best, IE8 second best.

If you use Typekit, you sign a EULA and agree to an arrangement that prevents you from improving the font. Or making it worse, if that's your druthers.
Plus, you don't get the font to install either in the OS, or on a pre-production server.

How a designer can take responsibility for the typography of a site under those conditions beats me. But if you enjoy swimming with a straightjacket on, good luck. Stick with it.
In its effort to prevent "casual download" by visitors to your site, the "service" has no choice but to prevent you from creative tinkering.
The primary responsibility of the service, first and foremost, is to serve fonts under conditions acceptable to those who contribute them. Your needs are secondary. (And it's a take it or leave it proposition, from all I've seen and heard and experienced.)
That is simply the nature of it.

If you want the freedom to "optimize", why don't you seek other options?

The way I look at it, Typekit and similar services are trying to create a market by making a product available in a way that is acceptable to the makers of that product. When a market is established, then it functions as a market, which means that consumers can make choices based on quality, options, etc.

There are fonts being made available through Typekit and other services that I wouldn't consider to be of high enough technical quality for web use, and I am quite sure that foundries licensing WOFF fonts will also be offering fonts that I don't think are fit to purpose. That's what happens when people rush to market.</div>

It's clear, I think, that there's more than "one font" being used here. Compare the consistent rendering of Arial across the browsers (GDI) vs the completely inconsistent rendering of the @font-face fonts. And that's just Windows. So Typekit would need to provide and provide tech support on multiple fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, and the two flavours of font suggests that the original font from the foundry is CFF. I'm interested to know whether the TTF conversion was performed by the foundry or by Typekit. Given that it is a conversion and probably not subject to a lot of manual hinting work, the IE9 rendering is all the more impressive (there are problems with the crossbars greying out, but that could be fixed with better hinting).</div>

Sorry for the confusion. I was most certainly not suggesting I intended to do anything to the font. The only optimization was with respect to the IE browser on the Windows operating system, and how either the sidebar or posts don't even appear in the right place on the page, or things which align properly in all other browsers don't align.

I don't know what you mean about swimming with a straightjacket on. At least by using Typekit, I have the opportunity to use a font that I like- what's my other choice? Specifying "sans" or "helvetica, arial, verdana?" That's better? Really?

This isn't quite true, you can specify multiple domains in each Kit's settings to allow for development. For instance, with the "Love Made Visible" site I've specified:
<code>pomegranita.com,wordpress,localhost</code>

Which allows me to test locally either with the 'wordpress' domain that I've entered into /etc/hosts (using Virtualhosts on Apache, so I can create multiple sites on the same machine) or just plain 'localhost'  if you have a single local website instance. Equally, I could use beta.example.com or any other domain if it was to be staged wider.</div>

<em>I don't know what you mean about swimming with a straightjacket on. At least by using Typekit, I have the opportunity to use a font that I like- what's my other choice? Specifying "sans" or "helvetica, arial, verdana?" That's better? Really?</em>

If that's the font you absolutely must use, and only Typekit has it, like I said, stick with it. But yet you seem to be having problems.

If you want to shop around you could check out Font Squirrel, Font Spring, Kernest, the League Of Movable Type, SIL, and a multitude of other font providers that will allow you to make changes as needed.

That's all.

@tim ahrens

On this thread, my perspective is that if you're struggling to get something acceptable from one vendor, you shop around.
Simple. I mean, you can stare at screen shots all day long and say, "Why? Why? Why?" but in this case, locked in as Begsini is to what Typekit provides, what are you going to do about it?
Hey, if Begsini wants a "service"? He can try Ascender. Fine by me. It's his web page, not mine.

@pause
Thanks for the information about using Typekit to view the font somewhere besides the approved domain. The instructions don't seem very straightforward, they don't seem very accessible to the non-technical, which has always been Typekit's main selling point (to customers at least), but I'll check it out.
It's been awhile since I tried Typekit.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi everybody,

I'm Type Manager for Typekit. This is a great conversation!

With regard to rendering quality, Stephen is correct — the performance of typefaces served by Typekit generally reflects the web-readiness of the font files we receive. We're working on some administrative tools right now that will help us spot rendering inconsistencies and aid discussion with foundry partners as we consider including new type (or revised type) in our library.

On the technical side of things: unless we receive TrueType files, we make them. In our experience, CFF fonts don't render as well as the same fonts converted to TTF. And neither Internet Explorer 6 nor 7 will load EOT files made with TTFs. If we do receive TrueType files from our foundry partners, we use those — and they usually look best, manual hinting or not.

John, I agree, IE9 looks wonderfully impressive.

Sii, John, Alex, as for rushing to market and coping with subpar Windows experiences at the present time, you make fair points. Windows rendering isn't great for some web fonts right now (though for others, under the right conditions, it is great). But people choose Typekit for lots of reasons.

Typekit has brought the creative freedom of type choice to a large, eager audience and has catalyzed (or at least encouraged) browser makers, type sellers, type designers, web designers, and businesspeople to take web typography seriously. These benefits alone are worth the sacrifices of getting involved early.

Stephen's suggestion about rendering "Arial for Windows users and Ratio for the rest" is prescient. My colleagues at Typekit HQ have a long list of features in the development queue, one of which is the ability to toggle kits off in certain environments. You can see early stages of this technology present in our [[http://blog.typekit.com/2010/04/09/typekit-now-supports-fonts-for-the-ipad/|experimental iPad support]].

Still, features and business aside, the aspect of Typekit's early presence in this market that I most respect and value is the success with which it continues to define the relationship of type within existing, standard web design practices.

Typekit provides a mental model that did not exist previously — for dealing with font files, styles and weights, character subsetting, and more, as well as the relationship between these new-to-web things and things that web designers already understand, like file size, CSS font properties, and markup.

Linking a font to a website can be simple, like adding a CSS background image. But when you want to use different styles of a typeface, use several typefaces, or attempt to keep current with browser support, things can get awfully hairy. Some people would rather these things be dead simple. So they use Typekit.

The excitement and freedom of this mental model, (not to mention of course, the idea of many visitors seeing beautifully drawn type) is what folks weigh against caring that their Windows visitors' text might seem as decrepit as nearly every other aspect of Windows users' personal computing experience.

Even then, as Stephen said, not all fonts render poorly. Only some. Typekit presents this information to users via a [[http://blog.typekit.com/2010/01/26/screenshots-of-all-our-fonts-in-every-browser-on-every-platform/|Browser Samples]] tab so they know what to expect. And in cases where type designers improve the Windows rendering of their fonts, we upgrade our library. That means any website using Typekit to serve these fonts will see an immediate and automatic improvement in rendering.

There's a lot to be excited about.

Jarrod, your blog looks great. I just added a screenshot to [[http://www.flickr.com/groups/typekit/pool/|Typekit's Flickr pool]].</div>

This sounds like an essential feature to have. 

More and more often I see sites whose typography looks like a butt, and sure enough every time it happens to be designed by someone with a Mac and @font-face directive. They are just ignorant about rendering issues and don't realize their site looks awful to a half of their visitors. Visitors that they end up loosing for a reason that stays a mystery to them.

Do not get me wrong though - I think Typekit is a great and timely idea which is executed well. I just wish you would be more open about major usability issues that it has at the moment. These issues are not your fault, and they can be fixed by working with foundries, but they must be clearly and visibly disclosed for your users to be consciously aware of them.

The process of detecting inconsistent rendering is easy to automate, and detected fonts should be clearly marked in your font library for all users to see. And even if you don't have this detection automated, it still takes only few seconds to manually check how all font styles look in all browsers, so the tagging for rendering inconsistencies should be a part of your approval process for a specific font.

...for all characters and sizes, and all user preferences. I get (for 256 chars x 30 sizes x just 9 browsers x 3 user preferences =) over 200,000 glyphs to check per style, 800,000 per family of four.

<strong>Ratio</strong> (from sii's shots):

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ratio-safari_4236.png]

2. In Firefox 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ratio-ff_6691.png]

3. Arithmetical per-pixel difference between #1 and #2
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ratio-diff_6371.png]

4. Same as #3 but desaturated and pure black removed
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ratio-diff-2_6611.png]

5. Histogram of #4

.

<strong>Museo Sans</strong> (from Typekit's type tester):

1. In Safari

2. In Firefox 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/museo-ff_3574.png]

3. Arithmetical per-pixel difference between #1 and #2

5. Histogram of #4

.

And once again, just the histograms, side by side:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/histograms_5632.png]
.

The one on the left basically shows a lot of "wobble" between the characters, and the one on the right shows virtually no difference as all spikes are near zero. Telling these two cases apart can be automated with ease, do you not agree?

>> ...it still takes only few seconds to manually check how all font styles look in all browsers[...]

For all practical intents and purposes it should be sufficient to check how "Quick Brown Fox ..." renders at, say, 15px size, not all glyphs at all sizes. Just do a quick visual check to spot problems like those with the Ratio. This will be a major step forward compared to not doing anything at all.</div>

I disagree rather strongly on that. I have seen many many cases where a given ppem size is just fine, yet going up or down one pixel is a problem. If you're really concerned about rendering quality, you need to check a range of sizes. Also include numbers in your test.

Sure, OK. No need to disagree <em>strongly</em> :) What I meant to say was that even a cursory visual examination of a small representative sample (instead of complete 800k of glyph variations) would go a long way.</div>

I see! Okay, so that's brilliant.

I think the issue we face in lower resolutions and smaller point sizes is that a quantitative comparison as you show is not fine enough for the kinds of decisions that have to be made on those smaller sizes. I.E. not every pixel is of the same importance 'down there' in the small sizes, as Thomas implies.

So, your Ratio example can (should) be solved as you say with a cursory visual examination, that ideally results in a recommendation to the user. 

>Perhaps having a way for the community of subscribers to rate fonts,

Agreed. And the EPAR is the chalice intended to hold this precious information, regardless of whether the font is foundry-rated as all commercial font properties should be, or community-rated as most free or share-me fonts would like.

What Alex's quantative comparison shows is, as he said, <em>inconsistent rendering,</em> i.e. it indicates that two renderings are different and how different they are. It doesn't indicate which is better, let alone which pixels within either rendering are important for legibility.</div>

Well, it depends how you are defining rendering. Do you mean all the process from outline to bitmap, or just from the transformed outline to the bitmap? 

I said; "...the issue we face in lower resolutions and smaller point sizes is that a quantitative comparison as you show is not fine enough for the kinds of decisions that have to be made on those smaller sizes"

Flattering. Truly, with no disprespect meant, that means I'm probably on the right track. 

@tim brown
Hi. Hope all is going well.

@apankrat
I like your approach. Not sure where it can take us, but real interesting. 

@johnhudson
<em>There are fonts being made available through Typekit and other services that I wouldn't consider to be of high enough technical quality for web use, and I am quite sure that foundries licensing WOFF fonts will also be offering fonts that I don't think are fit to purpose. That's what happens when people rush to market.</em>
To my eyes, I see a lot of crap, too. But...
1) As long as the presentation includes in-browser specimens, everything is up-front and if somebody chooses a font that, to me, stinks, that's their choice. It's when someone's being asked to choose a screen font from some enhanced Flash representation or generated image that's unacceptable.
2) As for rushing to market: except in rather unusual cases where getting it right the first time is crucial to success, all of the advantages lie with those who get into the market as early and as visibly as possible. These new services that are springing up like daisies now are also-rans. As soon as I met them in Atlanta, I immediately knew that the guys from Typekit "got it" as far as the marketing piece.
Rushing to market is almost always the name of the game.

BTW - there's some very interesting work being done with file conversion and autohinting. To the point where, it seems to me, there won't be much of a problem soon.
At least by most web author's standards. Even for body text.

Some of us want the advantage to lie with the reader.

To me, the rush to the web fonts market looks pretty much identical to the rush to the desktop publishing market, so I'm expecting a lot of bad typography and difficult to read text, and the better part of twenty years to clean up the mess. It isn't good enough to say that ‘if somebody chooses a font that … stinks, that's their choice’, because typography serves first reader, then the text, and only then the author/publisher.</div>

I think we are looking at the same thing from different angles. 

I am concerned with the case when someone finds a font that looks nice in his own browser, assumes that it looks as nice for everyone else and then proceeds to build a production website with it.

But isn't browser/platform testing a basic best practice in web design anyway?

That said, I'm all for ample warnings, Alex, and I'm sure Typekit will do their best to show render variation. Their impressive <a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2010/01/26/screenshots-of-all-our-fonts-in-every-browser-on-every-platform/">screenshot effort</a> is evidence of that.

John Hudson: <em>To me, the rush to the web fonts market looks pretty much identical to the rush to the desktop publishing market, so I'm expecting a lot of bad typography and difficult to read text, and the better part of twenty years to clean up the mess.</blockquote>

I too feared this <a href="http://typographica.org/2007/on-typography/embedded-web-fonts-return-uh-oh/">a few years ago</a> when @font-face was available but good webfonts were not. I'm happy to say my fears were not realized. Not then, and not yet. We're not out of the woods — webfonts haven't hit the mainstream — but I have increasing confidence in the ability of web designers responsible for major sites to make the right choices, typographic or otherwise. The web is a much more mature medium than DTP was in those early days of digital.</div>

I think what you described is a way for font developers to test one of the many criteria that lead to recommendations that web developers would find useful in developing typography on the web.

>I would appreciate a simple warning if the font may render differently in different browsers.

Consider it done. Simple Warning: Any font may render differently in different browsers! 

I believe what you would appreciate is a simple warning system within a standard, developed and used across the type industry. 

>At least by most web author's standards. Even for body text.
 
I think I'll add a sentence sniffer for readers who only want to read and write complete ones on the web. For some writers unfortunately, I think a stiff sentence is the only solution.

<em>Until I see some indication that the typographic standards of web authors are significantly higher than those of scrapbookers, I will remain unimpressed by this criterion of success.</em>
OK by me but yours or my opinion on the aesthetics isn't going to change anything.
Design-wise I'm surely not as picky as you are. Font-quality wise I'm probably just as picky as you are, and constantly frustrated.
I was looking at a blog called bobulate.com. Typekit is providing the fonts.
Now, I think the font for the body text sucks by anybody's standards.
But it does have a great virtue. <strong>It's not f-cking Georgia!</strong>
Let's tweet that one, too, while we're tweeting.
And when a better hinted font with the same visual qualities becomes available, it can be subbed for the sucky one with just the click of a mouse. And I'm sure that's what will happen. In the meantime, people have a way of adjusting their expectations and focusing on the content.

I don't really don't know what you want from people who've never had to deal with these issues before. For the first time in human history anyone can self publish and, on a neutral network, be on an equal footing with anybody else. And now, the choice of fonts has gone from around eight (families) to tens of thousands. Call me a populist, call me a cab, but that seems to me a good thing.
Considering that publishing is literally being re-invented for a new medium, I think we're doing rather well.
If some crappy typesetting is the price for all this, we're getting away rather cheaply don't you think?
You took issue with my statement that everyone is now a typographer but in a publishing environment where everyone can and, as a practical matter, <em>has to be their own typographer</em> how else would you like me to phrase it?
The barbarians are not only past the gate, they're sitting on your sofa and drinking your beer.

Perhaps, Typekit could notify designers what level of hints are in the fonts.

I don't know about your system/browser, but on mine (Vista/Firefox) the bobulate body text is pretty much unreadable, thanks to it being a) a CFF font under Windows GDI, b) grey not black, c) set at a fixed px size that is too small on my screen.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bobulate_3776.png]

There is no virtue in not being Georgia if the result is unreadable. Georgia is a <em>great</em> typeface, and from where I'm sitting it looks like remaining one of a tiny number of fonts that I would consider using for web text for a good while yet.

Heh, maybe what we'll see in a few months is the Georgia/Verdana reaction, when people start complaining that the web isn't as readable as it used to be.</div>

In coherent sentences? :)

But let me take issue once more: no one is forcing, as a practical matter, any self-publisher to be his own typographer. In very large part, the details of microtypography are taken out of his hands by the font itself, which is why it is crucial to have a well-made font, one that sets well and reads well. Similarly, macrotypography can -- and in many cases should be -- taken out of his hands by pre-made templates and style sheets designed by people who know what they're doing. And in the great majority of cases what the self-publisher should be doing is using Georgia or Verdana for text, because that's the best guarantee of readability, which is the prerequisite of text. If this self-publisher <em>takes it on himself</em> to use a different font, for the sake of novelty, he isn't being forced to be his own typographer: he's just doing something that, in all likelihood, he isn't qualified to do.
___

Rich, in all seriousness now, let me explain how I see the current situation of web text re. fonts.

You wrote: <em>…the choice of fonts has gone from around eight (families) to tens of thousands.</em>

I think the situation is more dramatic than that. Restricting our discussion to Latin writing system fonts, the choice has gone from exactly two font families that were designed and made for continuous reading on screen to some many thousand that were not.

Fonts fall into three categories when looked at with regard to web typography:

1. Fonts that were designed and made specifically to be read on screen, without regard to print conditions. There are a number of these, if one includes embedded OEM device fonts such as those David Berlow made for the Palm Pre, but in terms of the web there are essentially two, Georgia and Verdana, that can be reliably spec'd in CSS.

2. Fonts that were not designed specifically for screen reading, but which have been made in such a way as to have good screen legibility. Times New Roman and Arial are classic examples: print typefaces hinted for screen legibility. [That a font such as Times New Roman may become less, not more, readable when antialiased and spaced on a subpixel grid is a good indicator of the crucial role of proportion and spacing in the distinction between print and screen typography.] The Microsoft ClearType fonts also fall into this category, due to their being designed for use as document fonts in print at the same time as looking good within a particular screen rendering model. And the first offerings of text ‘web fonts’ from FontShop and other foundries also seem to fall within this category: typefaces designed for print being repurposed for the web with some hinting.

3. Fonts that were not designed for screen reading and which have not been made in such a way as to have good screen readability. This accounts for a very large percentage of Rich's ‘tens of thousands’ of fonts, and in Windows GDI environments includes <em>all</em> CFF fonts.

The good news about web typography is that I think Stewf is right that as a design medium the web is more mature than desktop publishing was in the years of typographic desolation, and there are a lot of sophisticated web designers capable of doing good work when given appropriate resources. But that doesn't change the fact that there are nothing like enough fonts in category 1 to maintain <em>current standards</em> of web readability if everyone suddenly wants to embrace diversity and novelty as typographic goals.</div>

Let's look at fonts on the web in the context of the various stages in the evolution of Disney Studios:
1)Steamboat Willie
2)Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs
4)The Lion King
5)Cars

Right now we're at Steamboat Willie. But I think we'll get to Snow White fairly rapidly.
Also, if some web authors are willing to sacrifice readability for "making a statement" with their choice of fonts and their typography, that's their choice and it's fine with me. I can't say I'll stick around to try and decipher what they've written under those circumstances, but it does make things interesting. I wonder how bobulate looks on a Mac?

@mike_duggan
Good catch on the synthesized bold and italic. I'm sure that's happening a lot. There's various reasons for it - all of which can be remedied. No reason it has to be that way.

		<div class="commentbody">Mike, the current Firefox rendering in Windows is a good indication of the font flavour. In this case, the rendering is (bad) greyscale antialiasing, whereas if it were TTF on my system it would display with ClearType. Obviously this diagnosis will not be as easy when Firefox switch to DWrite rendering in future versions.

My understanding based on this diagnosis is that Typekit received a CFF font from the foundry, and this is what they serve to Firefox etc. as either .woff or (split and otherwise obscured) naked font, but for IE they convert it to TTF -- I don't know how or what kind of autohinting or hint conversion they apply -- to serve as .eot.</div>

1. I do not have time (and skills) to manually hint it.
2. The font is originally hinted CFF. I do not have any further knowledge about how it is converted to TTF.
3. We did some experiments with TT autohinting and it, surprisingly, did not improve the appearance. It just got worse.
4. It annoys me a lot, but in the current situation responsible type designer is expected to cater for several rendering engines. Some are doing pretty well with CFFs (Safari) some are worse (IE). This is pretty much like developing multi-platform application. I do not have business environment to do that. And most of the type designers do not have it either. In this respect webfonts are too early. And it is not that type designers missed the train. Some rendering engines missed the train. … but I guess I am repeating what other people said already.</div>

Strange. As far as I have tested, converting PS hinting to TT hinting in FontLab gives decent results, at least better than nothing. Setting the alignment zones before you convert is a good idea, though.

There is, and if you set it up carefully you can get quite good results if you can count on subpixel rendering in the x-direction. FontLab TT autohinting is essentially a conversion of PS hinting data, treating PS blue zones and y-direction alignment CVT zones and PS standard stem hints as CVT distances. If the blue zones and standard stems have been appropriately set, the conversion of PS stem hints to TT instructions is quite good. Within a user-set tolerance, stem hints will be snapped to standard CVT distances. Links are anchored top or bottom relative to  The TT autohinter also tries to apply interpolation. There are TT autohint options that provide additional control over the process, and the results are editable.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ttautofl_6588.png]

I've had clients who could not afford manual hinting, but were satisfied with what I call semi-automatic hinting, in which I set the vertical alignment zones manually and fill in and edit standard stems in the TT hinting dialogue, and then run the FL autohinter. Then I usually so some small amount of editing, e.g. popping up the xheight at some size or changing the ppem size at which a stem jumps in thickness. In some cases, where the target environment is subpixel, I find the autohinting results best if no x-direction instructions are used.

Is this kind of approach capable of making a top quality screen readability font? No. But in terms of converting existing PS designs to get decent screen display, then it is quite good.</div>

John,
<cite>FontLab TT autohinting is essentially a conversion of PS hinting data</cite>
Exactly. Like I said above, there is no such thing as TT autohinting in FL, even though the options dialogue misleadingly calls it so. Autoconversion would be a more appropriate term.

<cite>treating PS blue zones and y-direction alignment CVT zones and PS standard stem hints as CVT distances</cite>
I think you are wrong there. It does not refer to the PS standard stems directly, you have to import them as TT stems and TT alignment zones first. Like I said above.

Exactly. Like I said above.</div>

@David - Since you supplied CFF OTF, they were not able to use TTF instructions.

@Dan- I agree, autohinting is decent. It gets you 80-90% of the way there. Good enough in my opinion. And I find that FontForge auto-instructing looks better than FontLab's.</div>

You can see that it is unhinted because of the black or white bits "sticking out". This is because the extrema are not rounded. [Edit: just saw that Ethan confirmed this first-hand]. Hinting would not remove the ugly steps but it can make the curve look more natural (as it is the case in the top of the large o, by sheer coincidence).

They key to good TT "autohinting" results is to set the TT stems and zones carefully <cite>before you convert the hints to TT</cite>. The PS stems and zones do not seem to play a role. If you open an OTF in FontLab then the TT stems and zones will be filled in from the corresponding PS data but if you are working from vfb they may be outdated or empty.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tim: <em>Like I said above, there is no such thing as TT autohinting in FL, even though the options dialogue misleadingly calls it so. Autoconversion would be a more appropriate term.</em>

FontLab TT autohinting also does things like interpolating cusp positions, generating triple hints, and even attempts some deltas, all of which are TT specific and not directly converted from PS hints. The autohinting process is a combination of conversion of aspects of a shared paradigm (vertical alignment zones, standard stem values) and automation of some TT-specific features.

<em>I think you are wrong there. It does not refer to the PS standard stems directly, you have to import them as TT stems and TT alignment zones first.</em>

This applies if you wish to do any editing of the TT hints and are converting PS hints to instructions within a VFB. If you have not put any values in the TT stems and alignment dialogue, the autohinter will use the values in the PS standard stems and blue zones by default during TTF generation. If you have not provided such information, then FontLab will try to automate that too. Basically, what FontLab does during hint automation is to use as much information as you provide and automate whatever is missing, so you can intervene within the automation at almost any step, for the whole font or for individual glyphs.</div>

After some experimenting I switched that one off. Can you show a convincing example of automatically generated triple hints in the y direction?

Your FontLab seems to behave differently from mine. On both of my computers (FL 5.04 Mac and FL 5.04 Win) the lack of TT zones means you don't get links attached to zones, and the lack of TT-specific stems means the links are not linked to stems. PS information is completely ignored.

It's hard to say since the fonts are all shown at large size and the italics are synthesized (I'm looking at the 'Weights & Styles' tab not the 'Browser Samples' -- see image below). Is there any way you could setup a page with a waterfall of one weight or two?

		<div class="commentbody">Tim, I wasn't suggesting that the TT-specific features of FontLab's autohinting were necessarily good, only that they exist and hence it isn't merely an auto-conversion of PS hinting. I've generally found the automation of interpolated cusps quite good.

Regarding the PS/TT stem data, it's been a while since I've used FontLab in this way -- most of our TTF work involves VTT hinting --, but my memory is that if one is allowing FontLab to autohint as part of its TTF generation process, then it makes use of PS standard stem and blue zone data. Note that this is a different process than running autohinting on the VFB file, which as you say requires importing of the PS data into the TT hinting tool.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I missed further development of this discussion.

@John & Ethan: we provided Typekit with autohinted* TTF and they sent us resulting screenshots from IE 6. The result had poor grid-fit even in larger sizes (compared to OTFs auto-converted to TTF by Typekit) => we decided not to use it and improve the OTFs (which are still not uploaded as far as I know). So, what you see now is most likely the very first version.
*) note, it is fairly possible that I did not do a good job with the hinting.

@Tim: ah I see, it was not really a question, I was just elaborating (without actually looking) what could be the cause. Yes, it is obvious that the zones are not properly set in this version. I do have a hint of understanding to hinting.

At the moment, I am waiting to see how the new version will perform. If it is not bearable, I will have Skolar TT-hinted more carefully.  Honestly, the cost-benefit of such investment is certainly in red numbers, i.e. I would do it just for the peace of my soul.

Where the responsibility for hinting (or better put correct appearance of typefaces) should reside? With designers, distributors or browser-makers? The webfont market is simply daunting.

		<div class="commentbody">>Where the responsibility for hinting (or better put correct appearance of typefaces) should reside? 

For the web, if you mean there, the responsibility for the design and hinting of the face has been put on the font, by the operating systems. One OS says no hinting, or all hinting. The other OS says some hinting or all hinting, though I suppose there are times when no hinting on Windows would work too. 

From there the question becomes point/pixel size of use, with designers, developers and distributors each perhaps having parts of the responsibility. The Browsers don't do anything complimentary to the problem, being trained to deal with so few fonts, dealing with all the fonts is going to be problematic for browsers for some measurable time. 

Then, when browsers "get" how to use the OS scaling and rendering, or make their own, it's the author's turn to be confounded. If the latter happens widely, it'll be the W3C's responsibility, I think. Early Signs are, even with the brilliance and energy of Typekit, "Yes", many web authors are confounded.

>The web font market is simply daunting.

Do you mean to the type designer?

Yes. It feels like a shooting a moving target. I quit webdesign for the same reason (adapting for too many browsers, scenarios, …, => losing control).
