  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've got an interesting design project I've been asked to take on, and which I'd like to share with you all. It's for a zine to be published at <a href="http://gordon.edu">Gordon College</a>, where I graduated from last year, and whose student newspaper I previously redesigned (with your <a href="http://typophile.com/node/736">much</a> <a href="http://typophile.com/node/977">appreciated</a> help -- though like me you may be wounded to know that the current editorship was using Verdana for the text last I saw). 

<strong>Background</strong> - Gordon is a generally hostile environment for LGBT people, due to its conservative Christian policies and culture. Most students (even some of the queer and questioning ones) feel that to be gay is sinful, and the administrators have in the past booted students even for pretty tame expressions of same-sex attraction, so virtually no one is out to more than their close friends. That may be slowly changing, but for now and the foreseeable future it's a rough place to be. 

<strong>Project</strong> - Amid this environment, there are usually a few progressive students trying to be a voice for change, and in that spirit two current students I know are trying to collect anonymous, personal stories from queer or questioning Gordonites and publish them together in a booklet. There will be about a dozen pieces, of various lengths. They've asked me to design it. It's a little daunting, which is why I'm seeking advice from the big boys and girls. 

I think this will be a milestone event, since it will be printed in fairly large numbers, and be probably the biggest act of public self-expression by queer students at Gordon ever, so I really really want to make it look really good.

So I'm trying to choose the fonts, and figure out what kind of feel would be most appropriate. To me it seems it should look personal, a little warm, even with a hint of humor, but still dignified and understated. Insofar as it's a student project, and more like a magazine than a newspaper, and ultimately about *L*O*V*E*, the display could be a little bold, and if space permits I'll probably make a couple illustrations (high contrast images of people perhaps). But these are people's personal stories, a few of them rather painful, so the display and illustrations shouldn't be exuberant to the point of irreverence.

The only fonts definitely on the shortlist so far are <a href="https://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-79-comenia-text">Comenia</a> for text and <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/Pelso">Pelso</a> for display, and I'm definitely still looking. Bello seems too out there, but for some reason I'm exploring going some distance in that direction. I might be thinking of <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ericsans.asp">Eric Sans</a> for display if I hadn't already used it for another project at Gordon last year. And it's a touch too informal perhaps, but I'd be considering <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=242924">Charter</a> for text if that wasn't the school paper's font (pre-Verdana anyway). 

Oh, and we have a small budget so I'm hoping to stay under $200.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Comenia: Nice, humane, friendly and very readable. Pelso: Mechanical, thin, cold, awkward.... Can you get a nicer face for display? Maybe find another organic face in Storm's catalog. Charter is very neutral and businesslike. Not at all bad for text (9 point in print), maybe something like Miller Display as headline face.</div>

<strong>Updates: </strong>(1) many of the articles may not have headings, just numbers, set like book chapter numbers. Having <strong>nice figures</strong> thus becomes key. (2) The title is likely to be <strong>Know</strong>, so a display that would look attractive on that word (probably all caps or all lc) is important also.

Storm: I do like <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-23-john-sans">John Sans</a>, particular the White and Heavy, though I'm not sure I like the 1 glyph. <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-42-sebastian">Sebastian</a> is also nice, maybe even for the text.

I also like <a href="http://www.emtype.net/relato_1.html">Relato</a> for text, and for display: <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/ParisinePlusPTF">Parisine Plus</a>, <a href="http://www.lucasfonts.com/lucasfnt/theserif/serif-.html">TheSerif</a>, <a href="http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/index.html">Bryant</a>  (maybe also <a href="">Gotham Rounded</a>), and maybe <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_oxtail.html">Oxtail</a>.

I think I'm looking for something less reserved than Miller. As for Pelso, I think you may be right, but I also did see a beautiful setting of a similar style of font recently in <em><a href="http://www.cyberpresse.ca/section/CPPRESSE">La Presse</a></em>... perhaps I'll take another look at it and compare it  to Pelso more closely.

		<div class="commentbody">i always prefer reading serifed type, but i suppose that Sebastian has a personal quality that several of your other choices above didn't seem to have (to me). i would think that you would want something personal to go with the tone of the stories you're presenting. and of course Dear Sarah is lovely as a display font and even works well at large sizes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, I'd like to use Sebastian because I'm intrigued by it, and feel it could almost work. But I agree it may not be the most readable at 24 pages.

I still like Comenia, but wish I could find something with a similar feel to compare it to (being a choice maximizer rather than satisficer). Does anything come to mind?

(Re: the other choices above, yes, I think I have reasonably OK taste given enough time, but my quick judgment is perhaps less good :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just bought Dear Sarah and Comenia and hit the Adobes. It's look rather more conventional than I originally hoped for, but nice, and perhaps a setting that doesn't draw too much attention to itself is best here anyway.

		<div class="commentbody">So here's <a href="">a copy</a> of the first "beta"-level draft. I'd love to hear any feedback on the design before it's finalized. [Update: link taken down after project finalized.]

Known issues: 
-- Minor design and typo fixes needed
-- E.g. Need to ligature-ize some of the pull quotes (wasn't able to get it to consistently join up the letters automatically)
-- The cover is a basic concept, not very fine-tuned yet -- suggestions welcome. For one thing, I'm trying to get the pink eye-catching without being an eyesore. (Though failing a hard proof from the printer, something we probably don't have time for, I'm not sure how finely I can control the outcome.)
-- There may also be a similar image on the back cover, no text, possibly <a href="http://clipart.com/en/close-up?o=4095884&memlevel=A&a=a&q=whisper%20boy%20girl&k_mode=all&s=1&e=17&show=&c=&cid=&findincat=&g=&cc=&page=&k_exc=&pubid=">this one</a>. 

Thanks everyone for all your help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh, and I recently found out that (probably at the design of the main editors) this booklet will be coming at an auspicious time -- two days prior, Gordon will be <a href="http://www.soulforce.org/equalityride">visited by Soulforce</a>, and from what they tell me the campus is totally wigging out with anxiety/anticipation (depending on whom)...

More on the cover: I'm having trouble with the type because (1) Comenia seems to fit with the image, but in itself seems too plain as a display and (2) Dear Sarah vice-versa.</div>
