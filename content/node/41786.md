body: "I've been considering this design for a while now. It's kind of an offshoot/development
  of an earlier design but I've decided to keep the same name since I never actually
  finished the last one - Magnitude. I've only drawn roughs of the thin weight and
  half of the black - my goal is to have five weights with italics and possibly alternates.\r\n\r\nBelow
  are some comped jpegs of the lower and uppercase, along with an earlier version
  vector test draw, rounded. The main features are the angled crossbars and curvature
  on certain glyphs. I'm unhappy with some of the glyphs so far (the g definitely
  needs reworked, maybe the M and a). I'd like to get some opinions on my creative
  direction and whether it's worthwhile pursuing this one.\r\n\r\nI know the images
  are a bit rough so it may be difficult to get a decent idea of the finished type.
  I'll try to get some PDF samples (vector) uploaded as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I like the way it's turned, but it needs a subtle humanistic touch to make
    it less stark, and more curves should merge rather than collide.

  body: 'To my point of view, I find this encouraging, I like the lower case, the
    rounded version is nice, however I agree with you, the g has to be reworked. I
    think the join between the two bowls is not well done and the lower bowl should
    be bigger than the one on the top.   Also, I think there could be a problem if
    you use on all caps the the oblique line, particularly in the capital letter B
    H E F and also in the lc f. May be keep it only in the A. This characteristics
    can make the reading difficult. '

  body: "I've embedded the thin and bold test sketches below, to save clicking through.\r\n\r\nI
    considered dropping the angled crossbar on the lowercase 't' and 'f' as I thought
    it would cause problems. I'm reluctant to lose the angled crossbars on the uppercase
    though, as it's one of the main features carried through from Magnitude, but I
    can understand why it might become a problem and I might need to rethink these
    too. Maybe I can keep them for an alternate display version or something.\r\n\r\nI'll
    try to get a vector sample uploaded asap to get some other suggestions. The sketches
    look a bit harsh, full of errors and inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback
    so far!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitled_thin_lc_5841.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitled_thin_uc_6557.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitles_bold_lc_5515.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitled_bold_uc_5696.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitled_thin_testdraw_6164.jpg]"

  body: So I think the main questions are... should I try to keep the 'angled horizontals'
    where possible? And which ones do you think will cause the most problems and should
    be dropped/reworked? (as sim said, the B, E, H, F and f might be problematic).

  body: Try curving them so that they have the angle on the left end but horizontal
    on the right.

  body: I'm not happy with the double-storey 'a' and 'g' - in fact I'm considering
    dropping them altogether as I don't think they fit well with the rest of the face.
    There is also an alternate 't' and 'f'. I'm drawing the uppercase now and should
    have the file to upload shortly.

  body: "I like the crossbars of the latter of each set, but I'm not sure about the
    new a and g. For the a, maybe you could try shortening the second a and extending
    the downstroke up into a second story.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already, check the
    wikipedia articles for all the letters' histories."
