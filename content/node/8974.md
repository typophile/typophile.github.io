  body: I have not been able to make this work but it may just be my ignorance.  What
    I did was generate the font in FOG and then open the generated PostScript font
    in FontLab. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: This is what I always do too. Generate both a pfb and an afm if you have any
    kerning &#40;&amp; why wouldn&#39;t you?&#41;. I use the ADVANCED setting in generating
    fonts with Fontographer, because it lets one specify a custom encoding and &amp;
    also set the font type to &#34;decorative&#34;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve done this for
    several years -- I use Fontographer because it is what I know best, then run the
    font through FontLab to remove all the bugs Fontographer seems to periodically
    throw  in. Pretty soon now I&#39;ll have to abandon the training wheels &amp;
    use FontLab from the get-go. <BR> <BR>Charles

  body: 'Dan, last September there was extensive discussion about this on the T-D
    list, with Yuri and Adam from FontLab commenting extensively. The short answer
    is no, other than methods such as those mentioned above. The FOG format is proprietary
    and Macromedia is apparently not willing to make it public. If you want to investigate
    further, here is the archive of the discussion in question: <BR> <BR><a href="http://type-design.p90.net/lists/archive.shtml?&amp;page=555"
    target="_blank">http://type-design.p90.net/lists/archive.shtml?&amp;page=555</a>
    <BR> <BR>The topic was &#34;designing versus technifying in FLAB&#34;. It gets
    pretty pointless at times, but there&#39;s some interesting information in there,
    too.'

  body: If it&#39;s any consolation, it usually takes less time &#40;often considerably
    less time&#41; to recreate something than it did to create it in the first place,
    assuming it&#39;s still fresh in your mind.

  body: Yeah, I know. It isn&#39;t SO tragic, more of an annoyance. And, it has pretty
    much sealed my decion to switch over to FL altogether &#40;soon
