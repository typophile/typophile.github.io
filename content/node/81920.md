body: "I have been attempting to test out Fontforge's MM feature. I have tried various
  things.\r\n\r\nHere I have created a 3-axis Adobe-style MM font, with 8 masters,
  using only an uppercase E. I can't get Fontforge to make an interpolation (instance)
  with these no matter how hard I try.\r\nThis is the font file: http://21326.info/work/LomoMM.sfd\r\n\r\nI
  have Googled various things relating to this, and looked through all the documentation,
  and still got nothing. What am I doing wrong?"
