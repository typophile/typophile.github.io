  here previously. My Name is Gustaf, currently Studying my last year on a BA Graphic
  Design course in the Uk.\r\n\r\nTo my question;\r\n\r\nI am producing an Opentype
  typeface as a part of a University Project using FontLab 5 for Win. As I have come
  to set kerning for it, iv run into some trouble. From some reading, as I understand
  it, class based kerning is the better alternative and then complimenting with  pairs
  for those which does not fit in a class with any other. I created a few classes
  manually with a few glyphs each. I understand that it should be done via the OpenType
  window but not sure how. \r\n\r\n<code>feature xxxx {\r\n  sub by ;\r\n} xxxx;</code>\r\n\r\nGet
  how to add that, and that the feature should be kern, but not how to set the actual
  kerning between the different classes. Is the a full list of the Opentype feature
  tags with how they are used anywhere? How do I set the opentype kerning of single
  pairs as a compliment to the classes?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n// Gustaf"

    make only one class \u2014 which will be used on both sides \u2014 for glyphs
    that are symmetrical, such as 'A', 'T' or 'V'. But things can get out of control
    pretty quickly if your glyphset contains an 'AE' glyph or a 'T_h' ligature, for
    example. In this case, if you don't separate those \"both sides\" classes it's
    likely you're going to have a bad time...\r\n\r\nMy point is, although it might
    sound like it's more work if one has to explicitly create left and right classes,
    that extra effort may in the end payoff, as it helps keeping you away from class
    kerning errors. And if you run into one of those, it will be easier to find the
    problem, IMO."

    classes with identical content into a single class. This may illustrate that the

    quotelefts, but postive kern the string \"quoteleft\" quotedblleft\", \"quotedblleft\"
    \"quoteleft\" and, \"quotedblleft\" \"quoteright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Comma\" and \"peroid\"
    are another favorite class that probably shouldn't be made. If you do this, compromises
    will abound. In fact, major punctuation probably shouldn't be combined for good
    kerning, though it is tempting.\r\n\r\nWith vowels, watch combining grave accents
    with the basic vowel, or be prepared for a lot of exceptions -- \"f\" \"agrave\"
    usually won't take a negative kern -- in fact, a lot of pairs that normally take
    a negative kern get gefuched with an accented vowel.\r\n\r\nI'm probably one of
    the few people here who is not a fan of class-based kerning. It can be helpful,
    just don't make establishing large classes to get the fewest number of kerning
    commands a goal. Back in the 1985 or so, our first PC version of TeX would only
    allow about 100 kerning/ligaturing commands (I forget the actual number). However,
    within a command, you could group characters -- sort of an early \"class kerning.\"

    in a double quote wasn't what you liked. Just about every 202 font was that way

    to get at the characters to fix them; a bit easier to get a third-party kerning
    program . . .\r\n\r\nAs to commas & periods, well, they take their space from
    the flow of the text, adding time as needed. They are also found in numbers (e.g.,
    17,421.76); abbreviations, U.S.A., D.C., G.E.M. Amscombe; etc. I'll confess I
    usually make up tabular commas and periods, but the other uses are kerned depending

    same setwidth. I fiddle with the sidebearings (& even the set) in the metrics
    window, so that both the comma & period look OK with all numeric combinations.
    Yes, I swap them in with the \"tabular\" feature. I also set U+2008 to that width
    -- even with InDesign's table features, I sometimes find padding a single entry
    the fastest way to decimal align a column.\r\n\r\nI also try to make the tabular
    figures all have the same setwidth, lining and oldstyle, in both roman & italic
    & even bold, as all will come up in a table from time to time. A number of fonts
    have a different setwidth for tablular numbers in roman than in italic. Makes
    for a mess.\r\n\r\nBTW, for a number of fonts, I also make up both lining and
    oldstyle arithmetic operators (plus, minus, equal, multiply, divide, greater,
    less), and occasionally currency symbols, (dollar, sterling). These are switched
    with the lining/oldstyle feature. A few fonts also need a lining/oldstyle endash,
