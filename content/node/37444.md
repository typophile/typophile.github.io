  newspaper, I used the RIP at our disposal to produce some broadsheet-sized proofs
  of my font. By setting up my PDF to be reverse, I got my letter-forms in black on
  transparent. The resolution is insane! It's also very handy for comparing shapes
  non-digitally, because I can lay multiple transparent sheets over each other.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  tried this or have any other ways to proof that others might want to know about?\r\n\r\n"

    white background, to be able to judge any shapes. But the resolution is insane,
    so I guess it's a very good proof indeed. :)\r\n\r\nThough, film material is quite
    expensive as far as I know. ;)"

  body: Yeah I'm laying them on a lightboard and using a loupe if I'm checking small
    text. The film is kind of expensive, but since we do it by the roll we always
    end up with less than a full broadsheet of film left, which I've started using
    for my proofs rather than throwing it out. Our laser printers at work suck, and
    so does the one I have at home, so this is really my only high quality hardproof
    option.
