body: does any one know how to create with fontlab and scanfont a 3 color logo font?
  I know that you must assign keystrokes for the 3 different colors but can only seem
  to create a black and white logo font ... anyone know how to assign the color without
  allowing the user to assign the color must be dummy proof :)

    to provide templates using the lock-up with the correct colors assigned so that
    the users never have to type the keystrokes and pick colors themselves. \r\n\r\nIn
    fact if you map the layers to hard-to-type locations, (such as the Unicode PUA)
    that might reduce the number of incorrect uses, but won't eliminate them completely.

  body: "<em>there are too many sites selling it for it not to work</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    but notice that <a href=\"http://www.signature-fonts.com/logo_fonts.asp\">they
    say</a>:\r\n\r\n\"Logo Fonts are Easy to use:\r\n\r\n- Select the font name from
    your program's font menu\r\n- Assign any point size (large or small) for a truly
    scalable signature\r\n- <strong>Assign any color to your logo (as your program
    allows)</strong>\r\n- Type in your pre-selected keyboard strokes to place your
    logo in your document\r\n- Can also be used in most graphics-based programs\"\r\n\r\nSo
    the user still has to select the color. And they have even <a href=\"http://www.signature-fonts.com/logo_font_instructions.asp\">more
    specific instructions</a>:\r\n\r\n\"Multi-Color Logo Font Usage:\r\n\r\n1. Once
    the font has been installed, open the program you intend to use the logo font
    in, such as a word processer or graphics program.\r\n2. When you have come to
    the place in the document or image in which you wish to place the logo, select
    ANY font other than your logo font and type in the numbers 1 thru 7 (1 2 3 4 5
    6 7 -- do NOT include spaces). Assign a point size of \"120 points\" for your
    first test. There are 7 different color elements in this particular color-logo-font,
    and we need assign a different color to element (number) that you typed.\r\n<strong>3.
    Highlight each character one at a time and assign a different color to each one.
    Once all 7 numbers have been assigned a color, hightlight all 7 numbers by dragging
    your curson across them.</strong>\r\n4. Once the 7 numbers are highlighted, open
    the font selection tool and scroll down through the list of fonts until you find
    \"YourLogo\", and then select.\r\n5. Your multi-color logo will now appear in
    your document.\"\r\n"

    JPEG into your document. I know these things are aimed at people who using logos
    in Office applications, so EPS wouldn't work, but the documents these people produce
    will be fine with an TIFF or JPEG. It's one simple step, and all the colors will
    stay consistent.
