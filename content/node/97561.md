  body: "I've brought the A to front. I think it distracts the nice curve of the B
    so I've used a narrower outline at the intersection point, just like I did with
    the S touching the T.\r\n\r\nNow these three all have slightly wider space between
    letters.\r\n\r\n- Even white outline of A in the top one.\r\n\r\n- Thin outline
    in the middle one.\r\n\r\n- B on top with thin outline in the bottom.\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"http://mousewave.com/preview/10.png\">\r\n\r\nBy the way Hrant, how about
    the counters of B, they should be curved on the edges, following the outer curve,
    right?"

    other thing bothering me is the \"noise\" where the \"S\" is overlapping the \"T\"
    - the resultant pointiness is out of character.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    ISType in June:\r\nhttp://www.istype.com/?p=776\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    menu. It's just a regular fast food place in \u0130zmir.\r\n\r\nBut I think I
    know what you mean; more variation on the letter width, maybe a tail somewhere
    would be great! That would take much much longer for me to complete such a logo
    though.\r\n"

    admit it :-).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'I would give yourself more freedom with the letter forms to allow them to
    relate in a more plastic way. Think of the patterns squished together in ground
    beef. To me this would help with some other problem areas: the small shapes on
    either side of the S, the awkwardness of some of the overlaps, the too rigid relationship
    between ON. Maybe a ligature for ST? Is it inspired by writing the name in ketchup?
    Could that be a way to develop further in a tactile way? I see the reason, but
    I am not entirely convinced that the outer stroke is necessary.'

    shapes on each side of S and some other adjustments.\r\n\r\nA variation with highlights
    I've done before and Hrant's diamonds below. Hrant, I think this diamond theme
    must also be carried on other elements, this way it does not match enough with
    the rest.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://mousewave.com/preview/11.png\">"

  body: I assume the client wanted you to add a cane? I don't really get it, nor do
    I think it adds. Just focus on making the lettering work and you will have a good
    solution. Negotiating with clients is a whole different question outside of this
    forum. If you want some help with the lettering, feel free to contact me.

    text-only logo, I could change their minds. At this point they'll go with the
    cane I believe.

    I could make use of the cane shape by depicting long sandwich breads in the logo.
    Still, I might design a mascot holding a cane in the future."
