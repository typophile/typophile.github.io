  alternates, as shown here: http://www.typography.com/fonts/cyclone/features/cyclone-alternates\r\n\r\nIf
  the fonts are stylistically different to Cyclone, but still feature the cap-height
  lowercase alternates, I'd still like to hear about them. I'm not at all fussed about
  the inline-style that Cyclone happens to feature. \r\n\r\nApologies if wrong section.
