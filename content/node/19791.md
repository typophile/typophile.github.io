  not trying to prove anything here, but it doesn't have the same contrast treatment

  body: You do see U's like that in fonts sometimes. Utopia is one. I find them to
    be a bit odd myself, even thought there seems to be a certain logic to it. The
    O and H, for example, are symmetrical, why not the U? The only reason I can think
    of is that U was derived from V and, therefore, follows the same thick/thin pattern.

  body: "It is the result of historical evolution indeed, so there is no real \"logic\"
    to the stress in the UC 'U'. On the other hand it's difficult to shake the familiarity
    of centuries of consistent use.\r\n\r\nOne of the funny examples I can think of
    is the previous incarnation of the logo of Belgian telecommunications company
    <a href=\"http://www.belgacom.be/home/en/jsp/dynamic/homepage.jsp\">Belgacom</a>.
    It used a customised version of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=E.1145.0.2&attributes.sampleSize=24&sampleText=B+E+L+G+A+C+O+M&sampleSize=24\">Template
    Gothic</a> where the original O and M were flipped horizontally because the stress
    was inverted. The O didin't bug me that much, but the \"correct\" M looked so
    wrong to a nerd like me. :^)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Belgacom_logo_5207.gif]"

  body: 'The stresses I think were based on calligraphy. The U would have been drawn
    in one stroke (unless it is completed by a tail) whereas the lowercase u was drawn
    in two, as was the O. '

  body: "> The U would have been drawn in one stroke\r\n\r\nNo, since the right stem
    would have to go up,\r\nand that's a no-no in (conventional) calligraphy.\r\n\r\nIf
    the Romans had a \"U\", they would have done a better job than us.\r\n\r\nMe,
    I like the one in \"Carter's Caps\", by William Carter.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
