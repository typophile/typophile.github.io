body: When one approaches the design of a new  typeface is there a method of checking
  beforehand to see if the typeface already exists or one is very similar and has
  the same feel. <BR> <BR>I am thinking of designing a typeface based on a art directors
  individual Germanic printing / writing style that is almost calligraphic. The art
  director is also a friend who would also be involved in the project. <BR> <BR>Thanks
  for your help. <BR> <BR>Kosmo

  body: The short answer to your question, Kosmo, is no. There is no way to easily
    see if a certain idea has already been translated into a typeface, because there
    is no official registry of typefaces. <BR> <BR>Even if your idea has already been
    realized &#34;exactly&#34; be someone else, which I doubt, I would encourage you
    to go ahead and produce your design anyway. I think that it is impossible that
    you could recreate a pre-existing typeface, unless you actually had it in front
    of you &#40;even them you&#39;d have to be really good to copy it <i>exactly</i>&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure that your design will be original.
