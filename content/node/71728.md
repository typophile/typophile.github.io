  macbook pro and i would really appreciate some help!!\r\n\r\nSome days ago I\u2019ve
  installed some fonts that was in my office server. It worked ok for a while until
  my boss decided to change the server name. So, now when i try to start FontExplorer
  it keeps trying to reach the server that no longer exists forcing me to forcequit
  it. I\u2019ve tried to uninstall it with Cleanmymac and Appcleaner, and it didn\u2019t
  work out.\r\n\r\nTanks!"

    luck!"
