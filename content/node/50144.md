    could be Knockout variations, but if you look closer there are differences on
    the \"R\" and a few other characters. However, you may be right, Titling Gothic
    highly resembles most, if not all, characters. \r\n\r\nMany thanks!"

  body: "Hey Lex,\r\n\r\nThey look pretty similar also, but you're right, there are
    some small differences. \r\n\r\nSo far, Titling seems to resemble it the most,
    I hope it is for the sake of my sanity!\r\n\r\nCheers."
