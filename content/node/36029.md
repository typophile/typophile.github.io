body: "I would like to know which glyph you start with when embarking on a new design.
  Do you always start with the same one? Why? Also, does one glyph set the tone for
  the rest of a face for you and why?\r\n\r\nI am finally taking a stab at my first
  face after years of wanting to, but would benefit from learning how you tackle a
  project and some of the rationale behind your approach. I think once I get rolling
  it will come easier, but I am not sure where to start.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: "It depends on how I am feeling but for the 'sense' of the design when I am
    sketching I will often go with a lower case a. Just for flavor. And then I go
    with o, then n. Then g. Not always. Sometimes a different glyph is what inspired
    me so I will push from there.\r\n\r\nWhen I digitize I go with o."

  body: In most cases I start of with an n and after that the o. It helps me to roughly
    determine the rythm and widths of the characters.

  body: "I usually start with an 'a' or an 'n'. The 'a' has round and straight shapes,
    and a terminal (two even), which I find usefull for determining the general feel
    of the face. The 'n' I use for the style of shoulder and connection to the stem(s).\r\nBut
    sometimes when I'm doodling without any real purpose I might be drawing a different
    character, and if it's something worthwile, I will go from that."

  body: "These are helpful!\r\n\r\nI spent the better part of the day yesterday sketching
    a's and n's with the odd o thrown in for good measure. Lots of fun! I am having
    trouble getting consistency, but I am certain that will come with time and as
    my pencil skills improve through use.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMike"
