    Condensed. A single storey /a is even available as alternative though OpenType
    alternatives. [[http://www.aldoexpress.com|Aldo Express]] is located in Uruguay
    and Daniel Hern\xE1ndez is from Chile. South american connection?"

  body: "Magallanes is very similar, but the terminals of the strokes are the wrong/opposite
    angle to your sample. \r\n\r\nSince the aldo logo appears to be a heavier weight
    of the text typeface, I suspect this is a custom identity typeface created specifically
    for the company."
