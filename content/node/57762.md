body: "The best way to snag that new job is to HAND WRITE a personal note (brief)
  and send it through the mail (yes, snail mail\u2014USPS).  This is in addition to
  following-up immediately with a brief email once you have forwarded your resume/CV
  and or had that all-crucial interview.\r\n\r\nAnother trick is to do your research,
  target for whom you want to work, write a letter and send IT through the mail.\r\n\r\nThis
  stuff really works, over 30 years I have maintained a consistent, successfull track
  record for getting in the front door of almost anywhere by finding the right person's
  name (make sure to get the correct spelling) and title, then drafting a letter,
  signing it and send it via the post office.  Wait  ten days or so then pick up the
  phone.  I get into 1/5th of the places to which I send real mail.  This is a hell
  of a lot better results than any e-generated initiatives.\r\n\r\nAlso...get the
  20% introductory special on REAL engraved monogram and notes.  (These are about
  2/3 the price of any other real engraved stationery!)\r\n\r\nwww.petitesuite.wordpress.com\r\n\r\nNot
  sure about how to write that letter or note?  There's loads of on-line help.  When
  in doubt, check-out an etiquette expert, too."
