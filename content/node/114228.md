body: "Well established, high end, nationally distributed Fine Art magazine is undergoing
  a redesign asap (to be started now and completed in days maybe weeks but not months)
  Sorry for not just telling you my name and what magazine I am redesigning now but
  I am not at liberty to \"publicly disclose\" this info but send me an email and
  I will inform you of everting by email or phone (hurray for technicalities). Of
  course, you can just look at the art section of any Barnes and Noble newsstand or
  google high end Fine Art magazine if your in a country that may not have in on the
  newsstand and figure it out.\r\n\r\nIf I had a budget (I myself, am not getting
  a cent for the redesign: Art magazine, even long established ones that target the
  affluent, often, ironically, generate little in the way of net profits) I would
  commission something as I have done in the past but clearly that is not an option
  unless someone reading this really wants to make a name for themselves. What is
  most likely and has also happened a number of times is that someone is working on
  a font/font family that fits what I am looking for and so they license it exclusively
  to the magazine for a token amount, like a dollar, for a set time period, like a
  few years or until the font is ready to be commercially available. (Don't worry,
  I will not disclose any names of who I have done this with but all one has to do
  is pay attention to who are the successful type designers who often have there fonts
  in magazines before they are commercially available.)\r\n\r\nSo what am I looking
  for? A high contrast serif headline face with a hairline thin hairline in the tradition
  of, but not a duplicate of, Caslon or Didot. More specifically this font has to
  communicate a \"slick high fashion\" sensibility through the same visual cues that
  the fonts BaronMTModern, Carine,  do (Examples shown) yet not be so radical that
  it irritates the predominately visually conservative sensibilities of its current
  audience who is accustomed to seeing headlines set in the Minion family. In other
  words I have to strike the delicate balance in the design between creating something
  \"hip\" enough to attract design forward members of generation x and millennials
  (which this publication needs to grow) without alienating the very affluent baby
  boomer and greatest generation readership it now has. From my perspective BaronMTModern
  and Carine are two examples that hit this balance perfectly. (though I can nit pick
  on some details) \r\n\r\nFonts I have considered using but just fell short include:\r\n\r\nBig
  Caslon \r\n(For the most part this would of been perfect but for the fact that everyone
  has the same cut installed on there computer and the hairline is not as thin as
  a hairline not to mention there are a few details that would need to be finessed.
  If any one has created a new version or something that is inspired by Big Caslon
  please let me know right alway)\r\n\r\nAmbroise \r\n(a bit overused right now and
  its unique attributes do not communicate \"slick high fashion\" to me)\r\n\r\nWilliams
  Caslon\r\n\r\nDidot\r\n(I looked at as many cuts by as many people as I could find)\r\n\r\nDidot
  elder\r\n\r\nBrunel\r\n\r\nMiller Banner \r\n(strong contender if only other magazines
  were not using it as much. Also, none of the cuts has a hairline as thin as a hairline.)\r\n\r\nThank
  you for taking the time to read this I will not be getting much sleep till this
  redesign is done so if you email me I will likely reply fairly quick. (ps I may
  be contacting some of you whom I have worked with in the past directly with the
  same message latter- did not want to be a jerk by calling on the weekend to ask
  for a favor)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wielden_alfonso_baron_6696.jpg]"

  body: "Matthew Carter has designed another \u201CBig\u201D in the vein of Big Caslon.
    This one is based on the larger styles cut by Isaac Moore, in the generation after
    Caslon and modelled after Baskerville\u2019s types. It is called therefore Big
    Moore. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure exactly when it is scheduled for official release,
    but the fonts themselves are done. There are, at present, only two styles \u2014
    Roman and Italic. The hairlines may not be fine enough for your requirement. But
    if you\u2019re interested, you might contact Harry Parker at the Font Bureau about
    reviewing/licensing in advance of the release."

  body: "Funny oldnick, \"cheap, cheap, cheap\" is not my objective at all but rather
    quality, quality, quality that fits the intended concept perfectly. Just as gourmet
    chefs hand select each ingredient and preaper everything from scratch rather then
    use pre processed and/or canned ingredients nether should a designers use pre
    processed ingredients like, layout templates, stock art and yes mass consumer
    fonts (no snobbery meant whatsoever.) A notable portion of the value that comes
    from design is the uniqueness of what is created but when you use elements that
    the public can get there hands on they mistakenly get the notion that there is
    nothing special about design and that, they themselves can \"find a better template\"
    and add \"several filter effects\" to \"really\" make the design \"sparkle.\"
    I have never met a wold class photographer, who at one time or another, did not
    have someone from the public - that is not a professional photographer - comment
    on how, if they (the non photographer) had that \"special, expensive\" cameral
    they  (the non photographer) would take even better photographs then the pro.\r\n\r\nI
    will be considering your suggestion with all the rest.\r\n\r\nThanks for the input."

  body: Just want to say thank you for all the impute that has come in, both on this
    bored and directly to my email. I am very impressed with both the generosity of
    spirit and the quality of work in the pipeline. If I have not yet had the chance
    to replay directly to your email I apologies, I am still working my way though
    the overwhelming response. I did not want to send a canned reply. I am very impressed
    at how some examples from type designers I was previously unfamiliar with are
    holding up against examples from people that everyone of us knows. Once I get
    all the mayor layout concepts done I will be able to test out the fonts in earnest
    so there is still plenty of time to keep the suggestions coming and thank you
    once more.
