  so I apologise in adavance, but...\r\n\r\nI wanted to know which foundry has the
  best cut of Helvetica, by \"best\" I mean loyal to the original design.\r\nI have
  Adobe's Helvetica and am assuming it is a butchered version, is Linotype the closest?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    display versions (say, from an old Letraset catalog or headline setting machine
    or even the metal foundry version), you may notice that it looks different. This
    is because Linotype's version was designed primarily for text setting (although
    you could set it larger on their machines).\r\n\r\nThe version that most closely
    matches the original Helvetica display sizes is URW's <a href=\"http://www.urw.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/english/schnellsuche.htd?searchchar=helvetica\"
    target=\"_blank\">Nimbus Sans</a>. They don't have a license to use the name,
    but it's the most faithful version of the display version in digital format."

    of Helvetica the best?\r\nHave later developments and changes to the font improved
    it, or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Since metal type came in size-specific designs, and digital type generally
    doesn't (and I've never heard of optical sizes of digital Helvetica) you might
    need to define the point size you're talking about to really answer this question.
    I'm guess not all digital Helveticas are based on the identical size master?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Here is a comparison of the early Linotype Helveticas and the original Haas
    version:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.marksimonson.com/Helveticas-compared.gif\r\n\r\nThe
    differences are most visible in the e and a.\r\n\r\nIn the top four you can see
    the source for the Linotype/Adobe version. The bottom two differ slightly, so
    you can see there were differences in the various point sizes that were cut in
    metal. The very bottom one is the version that was usually seen in display type
    before digital type took over, and the one URW sells as Nimbus Sans D.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a third version, Helvetica Neue. This was created by Linotype around 1980.
    It's supposed to be an improvement, and in many ways it is, particularly in terms
    of consistency of letterforms between weights. But it is even more different from
    the Haas original than the earlier Linotype version. I think it lacks some of
    the roundness that the original had.\r\n\r\nClearly, some versions of Helvetica
    are more \"authentic\" than others. The original display version was designed
    for display use, so I would use that one for a poster if I could. Ultimately,
    it's pretty subjective."

  body: Looking more at this, it does appear that Linotype's version followed the
    smaller Haas cut pretty closely.
