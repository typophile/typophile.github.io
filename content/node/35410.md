  body: "Personally, I think it's really clever and shows a lot of imagination and
    hard work. My thoughts would be:\r\n\r\n-- It's too complicated, making it difficult
    to read and comprehend the concept. I would simplifiy it overall, and try to lose
    some of the lines which obscure the lettershapes. Granted, you're trying to fill
    negative space and not leave unsightly gaps, but still, at first blush I find
    it a little tough to read. Maybe some air might actually help.\r\n\r\n-- Have
    you seen it in a very tiny version? I'm wondering if the tight kerning will plug
    up when reduced in size or printed under adverse conditions."

  body: "I would echo 'malbrights' comments.\r\n\r\nYour design is getting close to
    being a really good solid logotype...\r\n\r\nExcuse my dogma, the more I look
    at it, the more possibilities that I can see that might help the visability of
    the type, here are an initial few thoughts to try out?\r\nI think its crucial
    to get the 'C' clearly visible. Maybe lose the diagonal that links to the 'm'.
    At first glance you might need to move 'amp' left so the 'C' lines up with the
    90 degree vertical of the 'A' - I know this throws everything else out but thats
    why designing logos is'nt as easy as people think!\r\nThe 'B' doesn't need to
    be flipped.\r\nLose the line under the 'm'\r\n\r\nIf you look at some examples
    of Avant Garde being used by Herb Lubalin, you will see that it does'nt need to
    be as complicated to look great.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.graphic-design.com/Type/Avant/Avant2.html"

    and feels original yet retro at the same time. Perhaps you just use the written
    out name 'Ian Campbell' elsewhere in the marketing materials.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It does come across as mark from the 60's. Very iconic. A few suggestions,
    first, would be work on the 'A' in Ian. You may not need to make it so disjointed.
    Second, I would be curious to see what the 'M' would like if the bottom line was
    removed. Third, the 'B' might not need to be flipped. I'm sure making this changes
    would bring up the space you're probably tying to address. Do you have a color
    version? This might fix everyones readability issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.holadesignstudio.com"

  body: "Awesome feedback guys... I've had the same thought's concerning the \"C\",
    \"B\", \"M\" and \"A\". I'm at school and will try to have a follow up comp addressing
    all the points made. Always been a fan of Avant Garde magazine and Herb Lubalin,
    I would say he is a big influence of mine, if you couldn't tell already. \r\n\r\nThanks
    again."

  body: "This is complicated, maybe a little ugly BUT I like it. Hola raise a good
    question as to color. I'd say if you make the camera one color and your name another
    it will work just great. \r\n\r\nComments:\r\n\r\nI think it's a little odd that
    the A in Ian is slanted in the opposite direction from all the other angles.\r\n\r\nThe
    C is pretty close to being an O and lost. You need it to look more like a C than
    a lens. \r\n\r\nI think this is cool, though. As long as you have your name clearly
    printed in wherever you're using this readability shouldn't be a problem. If you
    want it to work all by itself start working off some of the feedback you've gotten
    here and post updates!"

    think the camera needs some work though, maybe having it filled with a color instead
    of just a stroke, might also work better in smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nOtherwise great
    idea.\r\n\r\npeter"

    separation:  i''ve always been told that if it has to rely on color, it hasn''t
