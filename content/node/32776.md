body: "Hello Typophiles\r\nIm after a similar logo to eye magazine. I'm guessing it's
  an original hand edited creation. But is there anything similar? I love the curve
  of the 'e's and I'm looking for looping 'L's and 'o's like in the Kelloggs logo.\r\n\r\nIt's
  for my refreshed business logo (hence the change life part) :)\r\n\r\nThanks very
  much\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eye_5592.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kellogs_3818.jpg]"

      on this logo,  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/amor_4117.jpg]\r\n\r\nalthough
      not quite what im looking for.\r\n\r\nIs there anything with the loops in the
      'Ls'?"

  body: If this is for a logo, it might be best to draw this from scratch. If you
    don't trust your skills (as I wouldn't trust mine) ask an expert. It will be worth
    the effort for a logo that is original.

    body: "Many thanks everyone! Monoline Script is excellent and really good reference
      for getting my curves correct.\r\n\r\nI spent a day drawing a rough outline
      (in line form) and with some tweaking and cross-reference to the above fonts
      mentioned I will be able to get it right.\r\n\r\nThanks all\r\nChad"
