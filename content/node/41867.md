  I can't remember how I did it now, I subscribed to a newsletter that every so often
  (can you tell I really remember little about it other than that it made my life
  amazing?) sent out fonts to download. Although the fonts being free didn't phase
  me, well, that's a lie, I was a starving college student, it was really neat to
  find new fonts in my e-mail (it really doesn't sound as thrilling as it was) SO,
  my point is, does anyone know of anything like that that is around now? All input
  is appreciated :)\r\n\r\n\r\n--A"

    newsletter will have a free font for download. Additionally some foundries and
    vendors also offer the occasional free font for download. You might also take
    a look through Typophile''s <a href="http://typophile.com/node/14652?">Typowiki
    Free Fonts FAQ</a>. Beyond that I know of no email newsletter that does this sort
    of thing. '
