  body: "Well, the duplicated letters seem identical, so a font is likely, but it
    doesn't look like one I've seen before. My suspicion is a custom font.\r\n\r\nT-26
    has some erratic looking scripts, like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/bacchus/|Bacchus]],
    or  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/baker-script/|Baker Script]], but that
    sort of thing is the closest I can think of.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks Mike! I was honored to be included even though I haven't updated Typographica
    enough this year. It pushed me to do more. Mark was definitely worthy.
