body: "I am setting a paragraph in Minion with an 8-line drop cap that happens to
  be an A. There is a lot of space between the right slant of the A and the left margin
  of the copy. Should I wrap the text so that the text margin follows the slant of
  the A? Same question for W. This is a relatively formal/traditional piece. Does
  anyone have an opinion?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Depends on the size of the A and the style of the piece. For an A that large
    I would probably follow its right stroke.

  body: "The larger the initial letter, the more important it is to \"shape\" the
    text block to that initial. I almost always have text following a cap A slide
    at an angle down the right stroke. This allows you to make a more coherent form
    out of the first word.\r\n\r\nMany typographers tuck the first line into an L,
    and sometimes subsequent lines, depending on the size of the L and the nature
    of the design.\r\n\r\nIt depends on the shape of an O, but sometimes the first
    line needs to be drawn close to the cap to make the first word form up well. Also
    for Q and for R some times.\r\n\r\nIt is not often seen that text following W
    or V follows the right stroke to the left. But with really large caps the case
    can be made, especially in heavily designed matter.\r\n\r\nWith \"straight\" initial
    caps I often snug the first line to the cap and then insert an en space between
    cap and text in subsequent lines.\r\n\r\nHave fun.\r\n\r\npowers"
