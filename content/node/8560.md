    <BR>I once had a discussion my grandpa about the need of new typefaces and typography.

    well? People prefer taking the way with the least of friction, commercialization

    if people have to read stuff, they will read and buy it! Even if its giving them

    preinstall our favorite 10 typefaces, would the standard reader tell the difference?
    And after 1 year those 10 faces will have been used so often, that most type designers

    <BR>That&#39;s not 100% true &#40;but what is?...&#41;: <BR>1. There are different
    layers of transparency, and those who take the Morison doctrine too seriously
    only see one layer, and as a result they think that something is either readable,
    or worthless. For one thing, there is a difference between the conscious appreciation
    versus the subconscious effects of type. <BR>2. It&#39;s not inconceivable that
    a reader can consciously appreciate a letterform, and this could add to the experience&#42;.
    Yes, this ruins immersion during reading, but immersion isn&#39;t everything.

    just some data-collection task. Tasks are for computers. <BR> <BR>&#62; &#42;Why

    more so than it&#39;s up to them to ascertain why the ride in one car is smoother/surer
    than another - that&#39;s the professional&#39;s job. <BR> <BR>Your insistance
    on linguistic study is also a non-starter. I don&#39;t know any type designer
    that isn&#39;t fluent in their own language and that of typography - they couldn&#39;t
    do that job otherwise. Considering the colision of likely letter pairs isn&#39;t
    really an issue, because type designers consider &#42;all&#42; letter pairs &#40;ie
    you make up test sheets of all posible combinations, which in the age of the intercap
    would include cap-lower-cap sets&#41;. <BR> <BR>The only linguistics that may
    come into this process are whether a certain pair may be &#34;useful&#34; or whether
    a ligature is worth making &#40;ie fffl does occur in German, but because of the
    grammar/structure used wouldn&#39;t be set as a four character ligature&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s for Western European Roman anyway. Where designers are unfamiliar
    with accented characters in Central/Estern European they would seek help and reference
    from people with more knowledge in those areas. The same is true of those I have
    known who have completed Greek or Cyrillic versions of their fonts. <BR> <BR>However,
    the questions here are not of linguistics, but of established style and practice.
    <BR> <BR>As to Michael&#39;s original question, yes of course you should look
    at any typeface that you are developing in a composed form. It&#39;s so easy to
    do today that I&#39;m amazed that one would even consider not doing so. <BR> <BR>The
    point of a typeface in the end is not to define individually perfect looking letters
    - because you must end up compromising on that anyway - but to develop a set of
    characters that work well together in text &#40;or display&#41;. <BR> <BR>Building
    a typeface character by character is as flawed as stealing parts out of the GM
    plant and trying to build a Cadillac bit by bit over time &#40;ie the trunk of
    a &#39;57 with the fender of a &#39;63...&#41; '

    most important to design with one&#39;s audience in mind. The question is: for
    how encompassing an audience does one wish to design? From a marketing standpoint,
    is it desirable/feasible for, say, a Canadian designer to invest the time and
    energy to complete a font with a full complement of Greek, Cyrillic, Swedish,
    Vietnamese and Lapp &#40;et al&#41; characters, styles, alignment, accents and
    diacritics? <BR> <BR>Well, yes and no. Yes if the designer wishes to market or
    use the design beyond his/her back yard; no, I suppose, if this is less of a concern.
    <BR> <BR>As a new designer just preparing to dip his toe into the waters of font
    marketing, this is a real concern to me. I want my fonts to be as professional
    and universal is is feasible. Some days it seems that the more I work on a font,
    the farther back the finish line seems to move. <BR> <BR>&#40;Architrave has a

    a face it needs to be seen in its context. &#40;The breadth of that context has
    been debated at length here, but it really does depend on the indended audience.&#41;

    rabid, eventually getting expelled, but was allowed to rejoin upon promising to
    refrain from personal attacks. Unfortunately, he picked up right where he had
    left off, and it took many more months of increasingly vicious attacks &#40;including
    accusations of rape&#41; for him to be expelled again. The worst part is that

    the value of anonymity: in &#42;practice&#42;, how many of the anonymous posts
    here have been more than just part of a smear campaign? I think maybe 2. <BR>
    <BR>Idea #1: Show the IP address for anonymous posts &#40;MyFonts does this -
    but only part of the address&#41;. <BR> <BR>Idea #2: Anonymous posts would be
    allowed, but screened for offensive/deceptive content. Yes, it&#39;s subjective,
    and yes, it&#39;s more work for the Typophile crew, but it might be a much needed
    compromise. In any case, to me things are pretty clear now &#40;again...&#41;,
    and the clearer things are, the sooner you act the better. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    post anonymously not to protect the anonymity of their identity so much as to
    avoid accountability of their message. <BR> <BR>If all posts require a valid email

    posting is necessary on a forum such as this. After all, this isn&#39;t the witness
    protection program; nobody is putting him- or herself in danger by posting an
    opinion or critique on type &#40;and if for some reason they are, then perhaps
    they shouldn&#39;t be posting to a public forum in the first place&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>We&#39;ve certainly seen the abuses in the past few days, from personal attacks
    to identity fraud to threats against the board itself. <BR> <BR>A &#34;nom de
