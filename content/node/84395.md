  in which the text \"WATER FUEL CELL\" and \"WATER POWERED CAR\" is written. It is
  a Copperplate-like font, but without the serifs.\r\n\r\nThings that could help identify
  the correct font:\r\n- The right stroke of the W and the left stroke of the A are
  parrallel.\r\n- The middle stroke of the E is clearly shorter than the top and bottom
  one.\r\n- The horizontal stroke of the A is rather low.\r\n- The letters are quite
  wide, just like the Copperplate font.\r\nI'd really like to see these three things
  in the font, since they are so distinctive.\r\n\r\nI tried the Sans-Copperplate
  Gothic font, but it's too narrow and the corners of the letters look \"damaged\".
  If there would be a bold version of this font with sharp corners, that would be
  the perfect one. Any ideas?"

- body: Yeah, looked at those two too, but the problem with both of these fonts is
    that the lines of the W and the A are not parallel when put next to each other
    :-(.

    would fit the bill.
