    the concept, but the kerning appear to be very tight. \r\n\r\nSB"

  body: "Thank you. Baptiste Consulting, is an IT Consulting firm. I collaborate with
    clients, to help them improve, manage and protect their business through information
    technology.\r\n\r\nI decided to use a wordmark, instead of a logo. I wanted it,
    to seem \"professional\" yet approachable. The moment I laid my eyes on the Univers
    font, I knew it was the right font.\r\nClean and approachable, well, at least
    to me.\r\n\r\nThe logo above, is a result of manual kerning, as I found the \"g\"
    hanging a bit to far away from the \"n\" \r\n\r\nWITHOUT kerning:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3593.png]\r\n\r\nAgain,
    thank you for your replies."

  body: "Hi. To my eye, the problem in the first (manually kerned) logo is that it
    looks like you made everything as tight as possible; rather than making the rhythm/pattern
    regular. That makes it look irregular and a bit cramped. For example in \xABConsulting\xBB
    the \"on\" and \"ul\" and \"in\" are too close together compared to the space
    around the \"t\" \u2013 which of course cannot be made much tighter, so it stands
    out like a bit of a gap. IMO the idea should be to harmonize and balance the spaces
    between the letters."

  body: "Thank you all. Yes, Nina, I tried to make it as close as possible, I even
    tried to create the same amount of space, between each letter. Lol, it seems like
    it doesn't work like that. Back to the proverbial drawing board.\r\n\r\nIs the
    second logo (No Kerning) closer to a proper rhythm than the first, with manual
    kerning?"

    assist the group in an effort to providing you with more meaningful feedback,
    can you tell us a little more about the context such as client, audience, goals,
    budget, timeline &c\u2026 Good design decision making (imo, lest we start yet
    <em>another</em> circular art v science \u201Cdebate\u201D) is based more upon
    fitness for purpose than it is subjective, aesthetic, and intuitive guesswork.\r\n\r\nAnd
    while I am a huge supporter of open-source communities, it may be worthwhile to

    thanks for using my favorite font in your wordmark ;)"

  body: "Sure thing Christopher. \r\n\r\nI live in Trinidad and Tobago, a small island
    in the Caribbean. Baptiste Consulting, is a Company that I started in 2010. An
    IT consulting company, through which I help managers improve, manage and protect
    their business through using information technology. \r\n\r\nMy target audience
    are managers of small business (Around 10-15 PC's) My goals for the word mark,
    is simplicity, seriousness and approachable. I know it's vague, but, you all can
    get the gist of my intention, from the photos I posted.\r\n\r\nAs simple as can
    be, that's just about it. I went with simplicity, because I think it will go well
    with my target audience.\r\n\r\nAfter much thought, and feedback, I've come up
    with the logo above as to me, it captures my intention.\r\n\r\nThe issue here,
    for me, is proper kerning of the logo. \r\n\r\nPlease tell me if the information
    I provided is helpful, thanks.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "for 'Consulting'  - move 'Co' a bit closer to 'nsulting' and the 'g' creeping
    away\r\n\r\nfor 'Baptiste' - move 'B' a bit closer to 'aptiste' \r\n\r\njust a
    little for both...\r\n\r\nBest way my professor describes it. Look at 3 groups
    letters at a time... if 2 of the 3 letters seem more friendly then space them
    so all 3 are evenly friendly.\r\n\r\nExample of how you would do this:\r\nfor
    Baptise:\r\n1. Bap\r\n2. apt\r\n3. pti\r\n4. tis\r\n5. ist\r\n6. ste\r\n\r\nfor
    Consulting:\r\n1. Con\r\n2. ons\r\n3. nsu\r\n4. sul\r\n5. ult\r\n6. lti\r\n7.

  body: "Hi Agiedo,\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you or your client would be open to this
    but, I would chop/reduce the width of the cross on the 't' in 'Consulting' if
    I were you. There seems to be a little ugly white dot developing in-between the
    'l' and 't'.\r\n\r\nThe curve on 'p' and 's' in the word 'Baptiste' tends to dull
    out the white space but the vertical 'l' in 'Consulting' really accentuates it."
