body: Hi everyone. I'm fairly new to the world of typography and font-creation (as
  in just started Sunday). I have been looking for months for a way to take an old
  .bmp font I had that I used on an old Windows machine and turn it into a .ttf for
  my Mac. I finally found a way to do that with FontStruct. The only trouble is that
  now my font is transparent!! Whenever I type, I get the outline of my font (because
  the font is an old Nintendo style font, the blocks I used in FontStruct only created
  the outer layer). I desperately need a way to take this now .ttf and make it whole!
  I've been looking all over the place, but programs cost so much money and I'm not
  sure the free ones can do what I need. If anyone has any help, I'd greatly appreciate
  it as I need this font for a graphics project and sadly, it being transparent just
  wont do!

  body: .ttf files can only be one color so far at I know, so you can't have both
    black and white which it soulds like you need. Can you fill in the letters in
    Fontstruct so that they are all black, and then do some kind of outlining with
    a graphics program to the typed text?

  body: I thought about that, but then the letters would be all black, and I need
    them to be all white. It's a perplexing situation I've gotten myself into. I attempted
    to fill them in using photoshop, but since they're transparent, there's no middle
    to fill in and it only changes the color of the border. I'm wondering now if anyone
    knows of a free third party application that might be able to fill them in for
    me... or if I'm doomed to never get this font just how I need it. Originally I
    had been cutting and pasting each individual letter to spell anything... and that's
    far more time consuming than I prefer.

  body: Didn't you paste twice? Two perfectly overlapping vector instructions may
    cause the glyph to be rendered as 'transparent' or with just a very thin contour.

  body: Paste twice? I'm using my font as a .ttf so that all I have to do is open
    up the type tool in Photoshop and type using my font, however my font is only
    an outline, with no filler in the middle. I wanted to have to avoid extracting
    the font from a seperate image, but I feel like I might not have a choice if I
    cant find some help.

  body: If I had to make a bitmap font and didn't have professional font software
    I'd probably recreate it in Fontstruct "manually".

  body: I did that. Now the font is transparent. Is there another application out
    there I can use to get ride of this transparency? I'd like to have more than just
    an outline of my font. = /

  body: You need to make a second font for the "white" parts. Then set the "black"
    and "white" fonts on top of one another, in layers, and make the "white" font
    white using the color palette in your graphics or layout program.

  body: It'll take some time to recreate the font as a filler for the outline, but
    that's genius. It's always the simplest solution that is often overlooked. Thank
    you so much!!

  body: It's really the <em>only</em> solution. Outline fonts only allow one color
    + transparency. The color part is undefined until you use the font in a document
    and pick a color (default is usually black).

  body: Well I appreciate the feedback. This was my first try at making a font, so
    now I know better. Again, thank you.
