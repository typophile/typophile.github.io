    delete it and make sure <BR>&#34;Generate &#34;kern&#34; feature if it is not
    defined&#34; is <BR>checked in your prefs under OpenType. <BR> <BR>This is a guess
    though...

  body: No deleting the kerning feature does not solve the problem. <BR> <BR>And I
    was wrong, the problem also shows up in Win 2000 and Indesign. I have generated
    all of my font the same way. <BR>In some fonts the kerning works, in some not.
    <BR> <BR>Does everybody else get well kerned OpenType fonts?

  body: The &#34;kern&#34; feature is generated in the font <BR>But the font does
    not always kern in applictions as Indesign, Quark &#40;and old Pagemaker&#41;.
    <BR>I have tested the fonts in OS X, OS 9.2.2 and Win 2000. <BR>The &#34;lost
    kerning &#34; appears random.  <BR>Some times OK in Windows, mostly OK in OS X
    and only on rare occasions in OS.9.2.2 <BR> <BR>I have some fonts &#40;OTF&#41;
    which works OK in all platforms and applictions. As far as I can se the fonts
    are generated the same as the fonts that not working.
