  body: Doesn't Fontlab generate CFF (T1) flavored rather that TT flavored OT fonts?
    Did that change in 5.0?

    not as easy to do as Type 1 hinting. Don't expect your fonts to perform on screen
    as well as Times New Roman or Arial. These were heavily and carefully hinted."

  body: "Eben, \r\n\r\nWindows TrueType was extended by Microsoft and named TrueType
    Open around 1994-95, and later (1997-98) renamed to TrueType-flavored OpenType,
    or OpenType TT. FontLab has supported TrueType and therefore TrueType-flavored
    OpenType since version 3.0, and allowed including OpenType Layout features since
    version 4.0 that came out in 2001. However, in FontLab versions prior to Studio
    5, the OpenType TT was simply labeled \"TrueType (.ttf)\" or \"Windows TrueType
    (.ttf)\". \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Regarding TrueType hinting -- FontLab Studio has very sophisticated autohinting
    which converts PostScript hints into TrueType instructions. However, it takes
    some experimentation to achieve the best results. One option would be to use Adobe's
    PostScript autohinter that is built into AFDKO 2, open the autohinted font in
    FLS and then convert the hints to instructions. Alternatively, you can use FLS's
    built-in autohinter. Two essential settings that should be carefully set, and
    perhaps re-turned several times *after* PostScript autohinting but *before* converting
    hints to instructions, are Font Info / Hinting settings / Alignment zones and
    also Standard stems. You can use the \"Auto\" buttons there (*after* PostScript
    autohinting) but it's sometimes useful to manually edit the stems to reduce their
    number (you'd usually take some average values). \r\n\r\nAfter converting hints
    to instructions, the stems are imported into the TT Hinting Options dialog (that
    can be opened by clicking on the \"...\" button in the TrueType Options panel
    when using the TrueType Hinting tool). In there, you can experiment with the \"Optimize
    PPM\" button and the \"Reset PPM\" button as well as with changing the values
    (you should open a multiline preview from the TrueType Tools panel, and then click
    on the \"Apply\" button in the TT Hinting Options dialog and observe how the results
    change). \r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: "Adam: Thanks for the clarification! \r\n\r\nSimon: Unless I have misunderstood
    something I think what Adam is getting at is the fact that the hinting systems
    in t1 & tt are quite quite different. AND if you want utterly optimal results
    \ on screen you will have to treat & tweak them differenetly. If screen is not
    a significant focus of your fontmaking the hinting strategy you describe using
    may be just fine. Adam isn't saying what you have to do; just what you might do
    if you were so inclined.\r\n\r\nAdam, feel free to correct me if I am in error
    here.\r\n"

  body: "Coop, \r\n\r\nindeed, the alignment zones and standard stems should in principle
    be the same between formats. But sometimes, it turns out to be necessary that
    you replace two alignment zones or stems with one that has a larger value, so
    that more things are aligned. Good setting of alignment zones and stem values
    has more impact in the TT hinting model than in the PS hinting model, because
    the PS hinting model is simpler while the rasterizer makes more decisions as for
    what to unify and align. In the TT hinting model, this information is taken more
    directly from the stems and zones, and of course, is driven by the instructions.
    But worrying in detail about the instructions is a yet another level of complexity,
    which I wouldn't worry at this point. \r\n\r\nNote that if you're using ClearType,
    the dependance on the perfectly optimized stems is slightly less relevant, but
    alignment zones are still important. \r\n\r\nAlso, for the stems, what's important
    to fine-tune in the TT hinting is the ppem sizes at which stems \"jump\" from
    one pixel to two pixels (and then from 2 to 3 etc.). Especially when designing
    semibold or bold styles, there may be some screen sizes where, using the standard
    Windows antialiasing (not ClearType), some styles may look the same although they
    nominally have different weights. In such case, for the bolder styles, you'd set
    the ppem sizes in which stems jump from 1 to 2 pixels lower (so they become thick
    \"earlier\", e.g. at 13 ppem), and for the regular styles higher (so they stay
    thin \"longer\", e.g. 17 ppem). I personally prefer typefaces for the screen where
    the regular style jumps from one pixel to two pixels as early as 15 ppem, but
    in a large family with many weights, this might not be practical (on the other
    hand, in such a family, it could be the Medium style that jumps at 15 or even
    14). \r\n\r\nPerhaps what I'm saying is that when choosing the optimal alignment
    zones and stems, you may want to test both PS and TT outlines and how they appear
    on screen, and then only after testing both outline flavors, you'd decide on using
    the same set of stems and zones for both PS and TT. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
