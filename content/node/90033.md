  typeface\r\nto complement Akzidenz Grotesk bold condensed. \r\n\r\nThis is to be
  used uppercase on a logotype and the intention \r\nis to create an interesting and
  beautiful contrast between \r\nold/traditional/delicate and modern and bold. \r\n\r\nThanks
  very much\r\n\r\n"

  body: How about Kepler Condensed? Being insipired to the "Modern" typefaces period
    (late XIX century), it should fit with Akzidenz Grotesk.

  body: "I find a quick way to browse is to flip through a one-line specimen. But
    not every foundry produces one of these anymore. A printed Font Bureau one-line
    specimen can be requested. It\u2019s also available for PDF download.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/books/onelinespecimens/\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s
    a more recent supplement covering additions to the library since 2008:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/books/onelinesupplement/\r\n\r\nbut
    I don\u2019t think that\u2019s available for download yet."
