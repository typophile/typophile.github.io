  body: "The 'E' is likely to have been created. The rest could be any of a number
    of existing fonts,all with the 'A' and 'H' crossbars extended to create a unique
    Logotype.\r\n\r\nSome close fonts include (these were found mostly with WhatTheFont)
    \r\n\r\n Trio  CT (Castle Type) the horizontal strokes are thicker\r\n Cameo Thinline
    (Red Rooster) - Cameo's 'O' isn't as round\r\nNocturne (Scholtz Fonts) - a completely
    different S\r\n and, all with similar differences\r\nT26 Minerva\r\nFont Bureau

  body: I'm totally up the octal forty without a clue. Try throwing this thread into
