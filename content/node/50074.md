  far as I understand by some typographers there are things you need to take care
  of when matching two fonts. I understand there needs to be some contrast because
  there's no use to use two fonts that are almost alike. \r\n\r\nIf I use Vista sans
  bold for headings for example what font would be best for body text (except maybe
  Vista sans regular) and WHY? I would like explanations so I can match fonts by myself
  in future. \r\n\r\nPS. Please, no answers with \"Match two fonts that look good
  together.\" That never ment much unfortunately, thanks. :)"
