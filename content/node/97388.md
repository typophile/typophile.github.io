    also be worth checking out the new 2012 version of CBS Didot."

    for Vogue]], designed exclusively by Jonathan Hoefler for Vogue International.\r\nThe
    best alternative would probably to go with [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100004|Didot]]
    (Didot Light Roman 96pt Master) by Hoefler and Frere-Jones, this one available
    to buy and also designed by Jonathan Hoefler."
