  body: instantly I thought 'Bellevue' but on closer examination in Suitcase, there
    are some inconsistencies .. although the uppercase charachters and ampersand are
    set in Bellevue - I'm not so sure about the lowercase charachters .. sorry Im
    only partial help to you :-(

  body: "Niall is right, the letters don't match. The stroke weights are clearly not
    the same, but so far I haven't figured out where those lower case letters came
    from. Were these copied from the same document?\r\n\r\nBelieve me, you don't want
    to duplicate this 'font', because it is a mismatched 'Frankentsein' creation.
    Do yourself a great service by choosing a font that you and your client like,
    and don't try to re-create this monstrosity.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think the lower case letters are from a solid version of Stuyvesant (Image
    Club used to sell one), but as I said, I think you would do much better to start
    over, and use all Bellevue, or pick a new font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "You're right that it looks like that old Nick Curtis freebie font, and now
    we can see how it was derived: He took Bellevue initials and merged them with
    Stuyvesant lower case and backslanted them. The letterforms match those two fonts,
    one-for-one, as far as I can see.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
