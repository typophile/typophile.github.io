  body: "This one has been asked <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/34210\">before</a>.\r\n\r\nIt's
    the Premier League proprietary font (called Premier League!) and is used on all
    shirts (not just Everton's).\r\n\r\nIt's a custom design by <a href=\"http://thebrandunion.com/OurWork/CaseStudy/82/RevitalisingAGlobalBrand\">The
    Brand Union</a> (possibly when it was still Enterprise IG). Click on the flash
    and you can see all the letters. Also a very interesting project sketchbook to
    look at.\r\n\r\nFor those who want to take a closer look, see <a href=\"http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/7a/71/0,,12306~94586,00.pdf\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n"
