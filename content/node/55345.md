  for granted that have fairly anonymous origins, but I'd have to say my favorite
  EXAMPLE of design (other than DVD or VHS box covers, whose designers are pretty
  well documented) is found in children's toys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/troll_5218.jpg]\r\nLet's
  face it. Someone designed this.\r\n\r\nWhile it might not be so glamorous or typographic
  as the design we're talking about here, I think 3d design is an important creative
  supplement to layout and cover designs. No, I'm not alluding to the sculptures of
  letterforms we're doing for another class... I'm talking about the muppets.\r\n\r\nPuppet
  design isn't exactly what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the interaction between
  the puppet and set design and the type design. Ads and things. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TheMuppetShowAlbum_6103.jpg]\r\nMuppet
  Show album cover. I've had a cow of a time trying to dig up the actual names of
  graphic/type designers for the show, but Henson had a heavy hand in it at least,
  and it shows.\r\n\r\nI like the Muppets. Puppets are fun :)"

  body: To make a font more personalized (or personable), it really helps to have
    a model to go off of, or a physical item in front of you to model after. The old
    dusty saloon background in the picture would not fit so well with a sans serif,
    spidery, unremarkable gray font. Yknow? If the muppets had an absurdly rigid typeface
    representing them in print, it wouldn't capture the show nearly so well.
