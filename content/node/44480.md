  I can't ID the type of typecase. It has 15 very small compartments on each side
  of a divider across the back. Any ideas? \r\nI paid $10 for it, and I'm thinking
  about going back and getting the remaining three typecases...each has different
  sorts. (Was this actually a good deal?)\r\n\r\nThanks! "

    the type is unusable the scrap factor comes to bare. Type cases are not included
    in the equation, They have their own value. I think you are safe, and $10. is
    nothing-take the risk.\r\n\r\nI was a typefounder.\r\n\r\nGiampa"
