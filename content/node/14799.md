  with Overprint Preview. Is there a way to export these so I can post them to Typophile
  and still retain the overprint effects?\r\n\r\n -t"

  body: "What you need to do is make a copy, then 'flatten transparency'. When you
    do, uncheck the 'preserve overprint' option. This will give you a CMYK conversion
    of what Illustrator thinks the overprint will look like.\r\n\r\nOne word of caution:
    If you are actually going to be overprinting solid inks, you might not want to
    take the 'illustrator' preview of that to seriously. Its very hard to simulate
    something the mixing of the inks. Although, it can serve many other purposes."

    a CMYK document.\r\n\r\nI hope that makes sense.\r\n\r\nRichard"

  body: "Kyle,\r\n\r\nThanks. There will be a tad bit of overprinting happening, but
    I'm going to discuss this in depth with the printer. He's a two-color specialist
    and I trust his opinion.\r\n\r\nWhen I flatten transparecy however, the colors
    go haywire. In overprint preview they are much closer to the pantone chips. I
    wanted to be able to replicate that for on screen viewing by Typophiles and client.\r\n\r\nI
    ended up doing it the hard way: taking a screen capture as PNG and then cropping
    the canvas in Photoshop. Yuck. Anyway, the result is in this thread where I'm
    currently soliciting feedback:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/14500\r\n\r\nSwintex,\r\n\r\nSame
    was true for Web Export. While the overprints/transparencies were there, the colors
    just looked WAY off."
