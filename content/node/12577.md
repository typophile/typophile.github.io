  interested in seeing how others are going about the design approval process.\r\n\r\nWe
  approach it like this:\r\nWe have an approval sheet that lists the designs, references
  the proposal/work order\r\nand if necessary lists the digital files (PDFs) used
  for approval. If the the proof is printed and not digital we have them intial and
  date each printed proof as well.\r\n\r\nHildebrant."

  body: Hildebrant, I have only one thought on approval process and this is being
    in the graphic design business for over 20 years. Approval forms are good intentions
    but when deadlines come up and key players can't be found the work goes out the
    door signed or unsigned. The thinking is it can always be changed at the service
    bureau or printer.
