body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nJust a quick question, are the 'ODEON' fonts (ODEON headline
  and ODEON lette gothic) the same as ITC Machine and Letter gotic. I e-mailed the
  company and recieved the following reply:\r\n\r\nDear Mr Storey, \r\n\r\nThank you
  for your subsequent email. The font used in the ODEON sign is not a commercially
  available font.  It is a unique font owned exclusively by ODEON and is used in all
  of our designs and most importantly forms our ODEON logo.  We actually use 2 different
  fonts: \r\n\r\n \r\nODEON Headline - This is the most recognisable font and is used
  in our name signs. It only has capital letters. \r\n\r\n \r\nODEON Letter Gothic
  - This is our secondary font and is used in sub-headings, etc.  Again, it only has
  capital letters. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope that this answers your questions. \r\n\r\n\r\nYours\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease
  find the images they sent me as well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/headline_4896.gif]
