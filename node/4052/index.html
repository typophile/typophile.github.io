Plus, the kids don't have to read complicated script shapes! (especially if they don't know how to write them) It was probably conscious in some way though I agree with you there's a paradox there.. especially courier!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Might it have been a way for people with imperfect lettering skills (probably 90% of us&hellip;) to save money on typesetting? I think at the very least the difficulty of getting good setting for cheap was a catalyst for giving it such a &quot;hand-made-font&quot; look. Saving money and creativity often go hand-in-hand. Frankling was wrong: it's not necessity that's the mother of invention, it's laziness! And greed is its father. <BR> <BR>One interesting thing in my sample above is that Courier's bad spacing (being a monospaced font) has been reproduced exactly! It seems like the author used tracing paper directly over laserprinted settings of Courier&hellip; In the 70s, maybe they used font specimen books that way? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, in the 70s we used to comp headlines for rough layouts by tracing over specimen books. The layout paper pads were not tracing paper, but high-quality rag paper, with enough transparency to do this (or trace over one's previous sketches, or a photocopy blow-up, whatever). <BR> <BR>So, back then, &quot;the preposterous google&quot; represents a &quot;rough layout&quot; look that was being used as finished artwork. (After all, illustrators would have been familiar with receiving &quot;tight comp&quot; layouts with this kind of lettering, from art directors, for positioning their illustrations.)  <BR> <BR>Now, the traced Courier appears to be about humanizing technology, and also represents the present-day myth that stuff for kids should look crudely formed, like they did it.  <BR> <BR>That is really  stupid, IMHO &ndash; not the way to educate children at all. Just because kids can't do sophisticated handwriting, doesn't mean they can't appreciate or understand it. Besides, Adults can't write any better either! <BR> <BR>Sure, Dr Seuss had wacky wonky lettering on his book covers, but it was beautifully drawn (unlike the recent travesty of his lettering in the Myers movie which was carried over into his re-released books), and inside his books the youngsters got Garamond and Century. No wonder boomers are so much smarter than subsequent generations &ndash; we grew up reading decent typography!</div>
