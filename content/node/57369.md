  the P22 and ITC johnston Underground fonts...?\r\nare there any differences in the
  letter forms, and if so which do people prefer?\r\n\r\nonce before i caused abit
  of a rumpus when i asked which is the better Garamond , ITC or Adobe (adobe won
  hands down), so its always helpful and insightful to hear what more experienced
  people than myself think...\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: When you are talking about a Garamond it seems like you have a fairly good
    idea about how it is likely to be used. In the case of Underground that seems
    less clear. And I think the use it is going to be put to may have a bearing on
    the choice. In many ways the best person to ask about differences is Paul Hunt
    because he was the man behind the P22 release. The P22 release Underground Pro
    is much more complex and covers more scripts than the ITC does.

    extensive...\r\nIts just a font ive seen used in some nice (and sometimes unexpected)
    ways lately, it really caught my eye on the Eat Your Own Ears promotional material
    for gigs...."

  body: "Paul can confirm this, but I believe the goals of the two revivals were different.
    ITC Johnston is an updating of the original design. It it \"regularizes\" the
    original, removing some of its quirkiness and clunkiness. For example, it tapers
    the joins more, in line with current thinking about letter design. But I see the
    redesign also changes a number of letters and in the process loses some of the
    distinctive charm of the original. \r\n\r\nI believe P22's Johnston Underground
    is more of an authentic revival, with all of the quirkiness and charm, and also
    a much expanded character set. \r\n\r\nAs Eben said, it depends on what you want
    it for. I think ITC Johnston was intended to for usage in signs where people were
    used to the original, but modernized a bit. I'm not sure I agree with the concept,
    but if that's what you want ITC Johnston is for you.   \r\n\r\nPersonally, I loved
    the original signs in the Tube when I was a student in London back in the '60s,
    so I'd go for Paul's version.  "
