<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Bell Canada just recently rebranded and revamped their website. They are using this typeface and I'd like to identity it. At first glance I thought it was a version of Neo, but I soon found out its different. Can someone please identity it? Thanks in Advance.

<div class=commentbody>You might try writing to their webmaster and see if you can learn what font they used. It sure doesn't look like any of the sans faces I collected for my Guide.

<div class=commentbody>After a bit of detective work I figured out that this is a new typeface called BellSlim designed this year by Canadian type designer [[http://www.ianbrignellletteringdesign.com|Ian Brignell]]. You can read a small bit about him [[http://villatype.blogspot.com/2008/04/type-club-review-part-2-ian-brignell.html|here]].
There is no reference to BellSlim anywhere online as far as I can gather but here is a link to the [[http://www.bell.ca/web/flash/bellSlim.swf|flash route file]] that the Bell website is using to render the font with (the same sIFR system typophile uses). The specific name of the font being used is BellSlim Regular which might suggest that there are more weights in existence.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, my dad's worked for Bell Canada for longer than I've been alive and I've seen quite a few versions of their identity throughout my life (yes, we have some Bell antiques around the house too)
I will say that for a company whose main focus is telecommunications, except for the logo just before this re-brand (the spinning-head logo as it was affectionately known), Bell has always had good design in their print materials.
This logo is a modern take on their logo from the 1970s, which was just the word <em>Bell</em> in a bold Sans. I don't watch any old-school television (internet television like <em>revision3.com</em> all the way!) so I regretfully haven't seen any of the TV ads, and am bewildered as to why they have chosen to embolden random letters on their website, but I'm sure it makes sense to somebody somewhere.
I think this re-brand is needed to freshen up the corporate image a little bit, the other one was easily datable as 1990s, and this will obviously be somewhat dated in the future, but I think it has much much more potential and staying power than the one that preceded it.</div>

Thanks, naoiseo.

A couple of years ago Bell was named <em>the</em> most mis-managed brand of its caliber. And even after this last rebrand (facelift) it still feels lacking and un-engaging, especially compared to Telus that did and continues to be doing [[http://video.google.ca/videosearch?q=telus++tv+ads|an absolutely marvelous job]] with their branding.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Alright, after days of researches and dozens of attempts I finally got that font out of a PDF file that was containing it. By the way, Bell totally missed that part with the PDF which was a documentation about their website design at Bell.ca, and you can find it relatively easy in google... so yeah, I got that PDF and extracted the font from there.
Now, I know some of you might say that it is stealing and all that, but hey! who is the idiot that is going to use it in commercial purposes? So be careful - for personal and noncommercial use only(!!!) as the font belongs to Bell Company and its designer, Ian Brignell.
ENJOY!
<strong>"BellSlim Regular"</strong>
[[ link removed by Admin ]]
And here is a pic that I made using this font:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bell font_4334.jpg]
*Note: The "Bell" font is just "Century Gothic - Bold", not sure if it is the actual one used for the "Bell" logo, but it is very similar...*
By the way, according to the PDF, there is indeed another version of the "BoldSlim" font in SemiBold, but unfortunately, it was not used in the PDF itself, so I don't have it.
Cheers,
