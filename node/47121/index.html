<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>TypeCon is a little more than a week away, and I realise that I still don't know where the best espresso is to be had in Buffalo. I mean seriously good, 25-second shots of chocolatey, crema-rich darkness, not Starbuck's burnt black p*ss. Anyone know?
While we're on the topic of Buffalo, what restaurants are recommended?
I've found a <a href=http://www.the-latinmass.com/id137.html>traditional Roman rite Mass</a> for Sunday morning, so church is taken care of.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Greetings!
Although not a coffee drinker (sorry) Spot on Delaware & Chippawa would be the best bet for non-chain coffee (closest to the hotel)... another sure bet would be Blue Mountain Coffee on Elmwood Avenue at Utica (they roast their own) and a little North on Elmwood is Dolci (elmwood and Breckenridge).
Good hunting!

<div class=commentbody>sushi's on the list, Ale. it's jut not sit-down sushi. i've heard it's actually very good sushi too, you just have to take it with you.
i've compiled <a href=http://www.pilcrowtype.com/blog/archives/19>my own list</a> to supplement the official food guide.
as for coffee, i think a lot of the locals enjoy Tim Horton's, but i've not tried it. it may be more american (Canadian) than you like...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul: <em>as for coffee, i think a lot of the locals enjoy Tim Horton’s, but i’ve not tried it. it may be more american (Canadian) than you like...</em>
Generally speaking, I don't drink drip or percolator coffee. Brew methods that kill most of the flavours in coffee just seem wrong to me. Coffee is like wine: the beans possess an extraordinary range and complexity of flavours. Good roasting and extraction will bring out the flavours, but most of the world's coffee is effectively destroyed by the people who make it. Imagine if 95% of the world's grape harvest were lumped together in large batches to produce largely indistinguishable cheap table wines.
People often assume, since I'm always keen to locate the best cafe in any destination, that I must drink a lot of coffee. I don't. Typically, I have one small espresso in the morning and another in the afternoon. I'm not downing gallons of the stuff to stay awake or excite my neurons. I want a fantastic taste experience, and I want to know where the beans have come from, who roasted them, and I want the drink made by someone who understands and cares about quality.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>“Tim Hortons? Isn’t that like going to Dunkin Donuts?”</em>
If Dunkin Donuts dispenses a bitter, overheated, industrially caffeinated liquid and markets it as coffee … then you’re bang on. My theory is that Tim Horton’s customers insist on ordering a <a href=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/06/30/doubledouble040630.html>double-double</a> (double cream, double sugar) in order to consume a beverage that’s just marginally palatable.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm with you John -- we used to have a coffee roaster in Seattle called Torrefazione that had a few storefronts. It was very good, but bought out by Charbucks and later shut down (rumor was they wanted Torrefazione's access to grocery store shelves).
One of their stores was a half block from our Fremont offices and the after-lunch shot of espresso was very good & is now very missed. Even in Seattle -- supposedly a US coffee haven -- the Peet's and Charbucks don't know how to pour a shot of espresso. They'll have only paper cups or full size mugs. Not a good solution. With the best espresso shots you get interesting floral notes similar to good quality dark chocolate.</div>

Depending on my caffeine need I may just go with tea or like James down the drip & think of TypeCon.

Zara, have you tried the siphon brew?
Fredrico, I don't know if we can get it brewed but we could try.
Iced Coffee made in the way the NYT talked about it a while ago might be the very best thing of all.

<div class=commentbody>Coffee in Buffalo?
Betty's on Virginal Street(http://www.bettysbuffalo.com) serves a great Cuban-style coffee. Although I am not coffee-expert I do like in black and strong!
Most local folks can get by with the Spot coffee within walking from the Hotel-- it is better than Starbucks (which is across the street).

<div class=commentbody>Bill --
I'm bummed that you (and Chris and Thomas) won't be joining us this year. Won't be the same without you.
I don't believe that there will be any official, concerted effort at recording sessions. Unfortunately, we just don't have the volunteer resources. More critically, there is no structure or capability yet to manage and publish any recordings.
There may be some individual initiatives to record certain sessions, coordinated through the sound booth. That's been done before. Tamye or Stephen might have a better idea. I think Eben might have volunteered to do something, but I don't know if anything came of it. Eben?
I do know that there will be an official, concerted effort at blogging this year, through the new and improved TypeCon site. I believe that Si is going to be spearheading that and is recruiting a team of bloggers.

<div class=commentbody>Well, my suggestion in the past has been to record the sound. Then could the slides be put with sound? I don't know how complicated that is, but people already have slides, and anything with a mike shouldn't be hard to record. It's probably way more trouble than I think, but maybe not.
If the speaker would say 'change slide' or 'slide 2' and such, then posting the audio file and slides, the viewer could coordinate it him or herself, with no additional labor needed beyond the posting the audio file and slides. </div>

What about good local beer in Buffalo? I'm looking, as John Hudson is in coffee, for that "fantastic taste experience." Not to get zonked.
& while we are at it, does Buffalo have any kind of free jazz scene? Or any other good jazz scene?

<div class=commentbody><em>Now green tea, that is the nectar of the gods...</em>
I wish I liked tea more. I have friends who are serious tea drinkers, and I'm impressed when they guide me through the taste development of some complex and carefully brewed tea. But I find even the best teas I have tried have a thin quality that I really don't care for much. While it is fascinating how the taste will develop over quarter of an hour, so that each cup is quite different, I don't actually <em>like</em> the taste. My favourite methods of making coffee are the ones that significantly thicken the density of the liquid, which may be another indication of why I'm not a tea drinker: tea is too much like flavoured water.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi there,
My name is Pam and I am Mark's sig oth. I hope you don't mind -- I saw the thread topic and grabbed the laptop because I wanted to jump in and recommend Caffe Aroma at 957 Elmwood. It's a small non-chain coffee joint with an independent bookstore next door called Talking Leaves. When I interviewed for my new job at the Albright-Knox I was taken there for breakfast. I noted that several members of the museum staff were stopping in on their way to work. The ambiance was great and I made a note to visit again when I could grab a cup of tea and browse the bookstore.
I look forward to meeting all of you next week!
Pam</div>

I may be going to the RIT tour http://typophile.com/node/46808 but should be back in time. You can catch a ride with me.</div>

<div class=commentbody>James, there should be no issue getting a space, and the ramp is right across the street from the hotel.
http://buffalo.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/services/parking/index.jsp
Pull up right in front of the Hyatt, go inside, check in and tell them you want the parking ramp in/out deal (unless you want to park it the whole time and not use it at all). It's $14 a day for in-and-out privileges, and the hotel will give you the passes and charge it directly to your room bill. Once you get your pass, leave your bags with the bellman while you zoom across the street and park.
There are also outdoor lots close to the hotel for those who just want to park for the day or a few hours.

<div class=commentbody>Pam, looking forward to meeting you too!
Bill, as far as I know there is no concerted effort at recording. It would be easy to do on some level and yet hard to do really well. I will not have time to look into it but dedicated 1GB+ drive and a laptop might be enough ( depending on compression ) to make it happen. A set and forget kind of model... The other side though is you would have to get speakers to say Okay to it and make clear how the recording would be used etc. Bill, my suggestion is if you want it to happen be the person that does it. The recording I have of the Typecrit from last year was made by a participant and then offered afterwards. I do feel lucky to have it though! Anybody with a laptop, sound recording software ( wiretap on the mac might be a good choice) and the ability to burn off archives each night could make this happen.
I like both the green tea (and venerate it) AND the coffee. And the beer. And the Sushi. And the Melons... A (no longer) secret hope of mine is that I may get to taste a real cantaloupe melon when I am at Reading on while traveling. What we call cantaloupe in the USA is not the same thing at all. I especially would like a <a href=http://rubbahslippahsinitaly.blogspot.com/2006/08/charentais-melon-soup.html>Charentais!</a>

<div class=commentbody>Hi all -- this will be my first TypeCon -- but -- I've been in Buffalo 8 years now... thought I'd throw in my 2 cents. Sorry for the blown out post -- I'm procrastinating on getting some work done. ;)
<li><strong>Coffee</strong> -- Spot, downtown (Delaware and Chippewa) is your best bet. There's a great little hole-in-the-wall (and I mean that in the kindest way) coffee shop on the north/west side of Allen St. and Elmwood Ave.</li>
<li><strong>Sushi</strong> -- definitely Kuni's To-Go... Pangea is a second runner up but a bit of a trek from the hotel.</li>
<li><strong>Diner</strong> -- hit up the Town Restaurant (Elmwood and Allen St.) for the classic diner experience -- or Betty's on Virginia (2 blks west of Elmwood) for something a bit more modern and artsy. Both are great.</li>
<li><strong>Beer</strong> -- my vote is on Flying Bison. It is a little bit out of the way... but worth it. Saturday afternoon is unofficial customer appreciation day at the brewery -- translation -- stop in, hang out for an hour, talk to the brewers, sample all the beers on tap and take a growler to go. Second runner of course is Pearl Street -- more of a restaurant/brew-pub... as opposed to FB's straight up brewery. Village Beer Merchant has a great selection (a bit pricey) of bottled brews and something like 8 or so regional beers on tap -- again fill a growler. They also have deli-style food.</li>
<li><strong>Best Bar/Food/Music Strip</strong> -- Allen Street (west or east of Elmwood Ave)... plenty to choose from... pubs, dives, live music (Nietszche's or Allen St. Hardware), etc. Worth the handful of blocks hike north of the hotel. Chippewa is good too -- but a bit young-n-rowdy-club for my tastes.</li>
<li><strong>Musical Treat</strong> -- Mickey Hart (drummer of the Grateful Dead) is playing for free downtown on Thursday - part of the Thursday At The Square series. Outdoor concert with beer and food tents. I wouldn't miss that -- but I'm a fan.</li>
<li><strong>Shameless Self Promotion</strong> -- If you're here early (like this Friday) we're having an opening reception for <strong>[[http://www.TypeIsArt.com|TypeIsArt.com]]</strong> at <strong>[[http://www.224Allen.com|SP@CE224]]</strong> (224 Allen Street) from 7-10PM. The show will be up thru the 19th so stop by any evening 6-9PM. There may be a closing reception on the 19th and there may be a keg of Flying Bison brew there... but only time will tell.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm not a fan of the Town -- I just don't understand the appeal, and the food's mediocre at best. If you do go there, don't get anything with bacon, unless you like translucent strips of fat with just a little bit of meat attached to it. They have the WORST bacon!
There's been some mention of the Elmwood Village, and there are several other good restaurants in that area. Saigon Cafe for Vietnamese, India Gate for Indian (just a few doors down towards Forest Ave, which marks the border of the Elmwood village area), and Pano's which is kind of a local landmark which was originally a tiny diner and is now in a bigger building, and more upscale.
If you go north on elmwood past Forest a few blocks, you'll be at the Albright Knox Art Gallery, which is not to be missed (free admission on Fridays', too). Go up Elmwood maybe a half mile, take a right on Hertel, and you'll find all sorts of restaurants, but mainly lots of good italian restaurants (of varying price levels -- Romeo and Juliet's is good and not too fancy or pricey, and you can sit outside).
Yes, I am made of Buffalite.

<div class=commentbody>In conjunction with TypeCon, Erik Spiekermann is giving a public talk on Friday night at 8:00 at the Albright-Knox.
We'll have a couple buses heading up there to ferry people. I don't yet know the time of the first bus, but we're going to be encouraging folks to head up early and catch dinner in the Elmwood area before the talk. So Jonathan's suggestions are right on target.

<div class=commentbody>Hertle is great for restaurants but TypeCon timing coincides with the Italian Festival
http://www.buffaloitalianfestival.com/
It's a bit crazy, if you like crowds and want some great Italian food and people watching, it is a fun side event.

<div class=commentbody>So we have established that Buffalo has the worst bacon, presumably of any location anywhere. Where in Buffalo would you go to get Buffalo’s worst bacon?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think Jonathan was referring to the Towne restaurant, not the "town" of Buffalo as bad bacon central. It is the late night Greek place in Allentown</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for clearing that up, Rich -- my missing "e" evidently caused a lot of bacon confusion. Indeed, I was referring to the Towne restaurant. To recap:
The Towne Restaurant: don't order anything with bacon
The rest of the city of Buffalo: order whatever you want, including bacon, from any of our fine, fine restaurants.
The beauty of Buffalo, and its close proximity to Canada, is that you can readily get regular bacon (aka "bacon") _and_ Canadian bacon (aka "back bacon"). It's truly a bacon-lover's paradise, except, once again, as long as you don't get it at the Towne.</div>
