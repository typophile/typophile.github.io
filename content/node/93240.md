  \r\nIs this dependent on the OS on which the font is installed?\r\n\r\nIf it is,
  and if it is different, I would be looking for the LEAST amount, so the filename
  would work on all OS's\r\n"

  body: For file names, if you go with the DOS 8+3 limit you will be pretty safe ;-)

  body: Note, too, that while Windows 3.1, which observes the 8.3 limit, supports
    only TTF, the operating systems that can handle OpenType don't have this constraint.

  body: "First, file names are arbitrary, and can be changed at will without affecting
    the font whatsoever (Windows  Type 1 pfb and associated pfm fonts  must have identical
    filenames except for the extension). Some of us automatically rename their font
    filenames to match the font name, using one or another font file renamer utility.
    That way, one can look at a directory listing and know what font it is., instead
    of having to open a file such as ABGBI___.otf\r\n\r\nIt also depends on where
    the fonts are located! Windows includes all installed fonts Font name ND File
    name) into a registry entry. Registry entries have a 64K size limit. Installed
    fonts NOT in the default fonts folder (yes, they don't have to be there) are included
    in the registry with their full names, including their paths. \r\n\r\nFILE names
    have different restrictions than FONT names, and these vary with the operating
    environment. For instance, some characters that are legitimate in font names may
    not be acceptable in file names, and vice versa.\r\n"

    curious how many people are still using Windows 3.1 and willing to buy a font,
    though."
