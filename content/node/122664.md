body: "Here's a 'dingbat' type font we inherited as part of a magazine publisher purchase.
  All we know about it is that it's named Needles and that it's a Windows Postcript
  font. Problem is, it's incorporated in such a way to the magazine that we can't
  simply replace it for something else.\r\n\r\nWe're trying to do our due diligence
  \ and make sure we're using it within it's EULA. Tough to do when you can't identify
  it's creator. We've not had any luck ID'ing yet, so I'm hoping someone here might
  be able to help.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: If you actually have the "Needles " font, it will really help to tell us what
    are the corresponding letters for e.g. the first 5 symbols of your image sample.

    the creator or (c)  line to get it.

  body: At some newspapers/magazines I've worked at, custom fonts were made as part
    of various redesigns, containing graphical elements in this style. (Us page editors
    would pick a certain style or run a certain macro to get the graphics, but they'd
    reside in a font file.) Perhaps this is the case here, also? Did you check with
    whoever did the last magazine redesign?

    There's no one there that knows anything about it, or cares to know. Too bad.
