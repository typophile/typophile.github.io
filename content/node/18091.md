  target=\"_blank\">mariacornejo</a>, \r\n\r\nwe have traditionally used Courier extensively,
  we don't\r\nwant to move away from our 'typewriter' feel, but would like to make
  it \r\na little more legible and more beautiful for the screen. \r\n\r\nI find that
  i like the feel of Prestige Roman and Prestige Bold (which i\r\nsaw in the last
  baseline (baselinemagazine.com), also i think its the same\r\nused in some parts
  of ID magazine for the last few years.)\r\n\r\nI have found Prestige Elite on Linotype,
  and my PC comes pre installed with Prestige Elite Std, but even though i like the
  general look of this type, i prefer Prestige Roman!\r\n\r\nAnyone know where i might
  purchase the non-elite roman version?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbest ian"
