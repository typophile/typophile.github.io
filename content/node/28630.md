  body: "I know it doesn't sound like a solution, but can't you just hand-delete the
    two nodes? If you put the original curves on the mask layer, you can tweak some
    handles to get as close as possible to the original curves.\r\n\r\nThe additional
    nodes are probably generated by some kind of rounding off / curve fitting scheme.
    I am not sure, but I thought that by definition T1 and TT curves could be cut
    (i.e. node inserted) at any point without affecting the overall shape. This only
    holds if you have an infinitely fine grid (mathematical x-y plane...), so it wouldn't
    apply on the typical 1000 PPM grids FL works with. Bezier handles and nodes are
    then restricted to be placed on these incremental 'grid points'. \r\n\r\nI guess
    that this is why FL sometimes inserts these additional nodes to best approximate
    the original curves. You could confirm this if you 'loosen up' the original curves
    and make them meet at a larger angle, or if you size them up, so they span more
    grid points. At some point FL doesn't have to insert extra nodes as it can put
    the Bezier handles more accurately.\r\n\r\nHope this theoretical speculation helps...\r\n\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n"

    know where white and black is like this. Could you show the whole shape instead
    of just a section? Also, it would be helpful if you showed the BCPs. Maybe they
    are not exactly horizontal and vertical?\r\nTim"

  body: "Hmmmm, quite interesting. My guess is that FL somehow retains the existing
    nodes (they are in perfectly identical positions, right?). Then, because node
    positions are whole-numbered, it treats the two curves as identical up to the
    point where they diverge by more than one unit, hence the additional node.\r\n\r\nThe
    curves in shape(s) 2 are not visible in the final result anyway - what happens
    if you turn them into straights (select a BCP and delete it)? This would mean
    that the two shapes touch without overlap. In my experiance FL should still recognise
    this and join the shapes.\r\n\r\nIf this fails you could insert a node somewhere
    in the curves of shape 2 and then turn them into straight lines, leaving a triangular
    overlap.\r\n\r\nThird attempt: make the curves of shape(s) 2 very shallow, i.e.
    retract the BCPs almost completely. This leaves an overlap but makes the curve
    \"leave\" the other one more rapidly.\r\n\r\nTim"

    two) and it worked. I'm going to do this with all the other glyphs I designed
    this way. It still is strange that Fontlab can't handle it right. Again, thanks
