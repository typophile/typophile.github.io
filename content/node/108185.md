body: " Hi Team!\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate your advice. My client is looking
  for a body copy face that  that gives a sense of being 'carved' on the page. She's
  looking for a sense of ancient.\r\n\r\nFurther, she described it as kind of industrial,
  elegant...not a warm, personal, intimate feeling,  but more industrial, with a sense
  of iron...but not too austere...\r\n\r\nFor chapter headers she's liking Goudy Trajan,
  but personally, I think its tired so we're looking for a replacement for that as
  well. \r\n\r\nThe book contains poetry, so for the most part, the text will not
  be dense on the page.\r\n\r\nHere's her current choice, of which I was no part.
  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThank you! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo_3817.JPG]"

  body: "Very subjective criteria for the body text. I hesitate make suggestions based
    on them and I trust you are familiar with the common candidates. A less known
    prospect might be Aragon by Canada Type http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/aragon/
    Or you might browse through some of the suggestions recently posted in the long
    running thread Best Serif Ever http://typophile.com/node/27736\r\nAs for the Trajan
    replacement, one possibility that I like is Centaur, an elegant font with a sculptural
    feeling\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/centaur/\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: Thank you, Don! I know what you mean about that criteria. That's why this
    is driving me nuts. I have no idea.
