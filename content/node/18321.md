body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am baffled. I'm pulling individual pages from an InDesign document
  and re-working the layout to fit a page with pre-printed headers. I'm using 2 adobe
  open type fonts. \r\n\r\nMy superscripts are fine in the original document, but
  in the pulled pages, I'm having problems. With the serif font superscripting the
  er of 1er works fine and also reduces the size automatically. The sans serif just
  doesn't. The characters are raised but the size isn't reduced. In some cases when
  I select superscript it actually un-superscripts it. Is there something else --
  like a document preset that could be affecting the superscript? Literally copying
  one that appears the way I want and pasting it into the other file does not work.
  I get a raised, but full size er.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's time to shut down and start
  up again...\r\n\r\nGrr.\r\nAny help would be wonderful.\r\n "

  body: "Hi Kristina,\r\n\r\nIt's hard to say without seeing your file, but here are
    some thoughts in order of probability:\r\n\r\n1) There is superscripting built
    in to InDesign, and there is ALSO an Opentype superscripting available IF it's
    built into the font. Perhaps you are selecting \"Opentype superscripting\" from
    the special Opentype menu -- but if it's not built into your font, nothing will
    happen. Choose the other superscript option from the character palette\r\n\r\n2)
    Maybe the preference is tweaked -- you can set the percentage that superscript
    reduces the font\r\n\r\n3) Style sheets in both documents with the same name but
    different definitions?\r\n\r\nLet me know if you figure it out.\r\n"

  body: "Inarges,\r\n\r\nThank you. I had already tried both the Open type and normal
    superscripting, to no avail.  \r\n\r\nBoth the correct and non superscripts show
    the size as 100%. I will look into the style sheets -- hadn't thought of that.
    Thank you for your help.\r\n\r\nKristina. "
