  body: Thanks for the reply, it is such a nice poster.  In the interest of full disclosure,
    my response was not really neccesary and I am kind of shamelessly bumping this.
    If that sort of thing is not appreciated let me know and i won't do it again,
    but I am really curious what it is

    The preview image is lousy, but I have the font and can assure you that it is
    a match.\r\n\r\nEdit: Might still be available from <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html\"

    original name."

    it was the same face without the outline and ornamentation, but I was wrong. Anyone?\r\n\r\nThanks
    in advance!"
