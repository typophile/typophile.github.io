body: "I'm a life long typefan and newly aspiring \"font maker\" and I was wondering
  if there were any good sources for online scans of \"classic\" font faces like Garamond
  or Caslon. I'm looking to teach myself at least the \"mechanics\" of font making
  by creating some nice digitizations of the old classics for release under an Open
  Source license (probably the LGPL but I haven't decided yet and probably won't until
  I have an actual preliminary release that someone might want to use and/or help
  build)\r\n\r\nIdeally the samples should contain a complete set of numbers, letters
  and punctuation, but seeing as that's not the way they seem to have done things
  \"back in the day\", I'd be happy with links to almost anything."

    I'm always inspired by their early vintage type styles.

  body: Not sure what Letterhead Fonts has to do with this request. I think Michael's
    looking for something like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17208860@N00/sets/690970/detail/">this
    set of specimens</a>. They are not suitable for tracing, but that's the best online
    collection of metal type specimens I know. I would seek for some old catalogs
    from used bookshops and Ebay.

    maybe I can get something useful :)

  body: Well the archive.org copy of the ATF catalouge was a "bust", but I did find
    some quite high-resolution scans on the website of Ghostscript maintainer Raph
    Levien. He has a nice scan of ATF Garamond (normal only) and a few others up.
    I think I'm going to try my hand at ATF Venetian, which despite its name, actually
    seems to be a "Modern" style font a la Bodoni. I figure that since there's already
    at least one decent FOSS old-style (URW Palladio, an actual Zapf-approved version
    of Palatino), I might as well start where I'll be forgin new territory... Pictures,
    PDFs and info will be provided as things progress.

  body: "That's me, and the scans (and a few other things) are at <a href=\"http://levien.com/type/\">levien.com/type</a>.
    The original 2400 dpi versions are also <a href=\"http://tug.org/levienfonts\">online
    at the TUG site</a>.\r\n\r\nBut there are also many, many excellent specimen books
    available at an affordable price. Either the 1934 or 1941 edition of the ATF specimen
    book is $14 or so from abebooks. Don't forget European founders either. A lot
    of the ATF fonts have been mined out, especially by Bitstream in the 80s. If you
    can visit San Francisco, the Grabhorn collection at the SF Public Library has
    an awesome collection of specimen books, and there are no doubt other similar
    collections near you (the <a href=\"http://wally.rit.edu/cary/\">Cary</a> in Rochester,
    etc).\r\n\r\nBest of luck in your efforts.\r\n"

  body: "Apart from foundry specimens, old science books are a good source, as they
    tend to have figures and fractions, math symbols, and often for the natural sciences,
    species names in small caps or italics. And superiors and footnotes. You get a
    strong feeling for the personality of a typeface seeing it in real use. Some foundry
    specimens, such as Linotype, 1923, or Bauer c.1936, have a lot of faux usage (pseudo
    advertisements, letterheads, etc.), which is almost as good.\r\n\r\nIn general,
    I would say work from actual letterpress originals rather than scans. Why copy
    a copy? Without seeing how a design works in its intended medium, your education
    will be missing something."

  body: "Raph: Thanks for the pointers. ATM I have to save my pennies for a photo
    class trip to NYC, but after that I'll look into getting a copy of either the
    '34 or '41 editions (or both). As for European foundries, I'll have to look into
    it. At the moment, I'm pretty restricted to what's online and what I can find
    in the Boston Public Library (which has a few things including the Keystone Type
    Foundry's 1906 book, the '34 ATF, the 1924 Caslon specimen, and a bunch of from
    the 1850s to the 1940s) Guess that'll hold me over until I can travel ;) As for
    the ATF being \"over-mined\" by Bitstream already, I'm not really concerned...
    proprietary fonts aren't very useful to true Linux nerds, after all.\r\n\r\nNick:
    At this point I'm still \"playing around\" with the basic mechanics of things,
    mainly by tracing from scans. Once know what I'm doing a bit more I will look
    for more \"real usage\" sources, but at the moment, having all the characters
    in one place for me to shamelessly rip off is of utmost importance :P"

    to see what it's worth, and by Googling \"caslon 1924\" (the year of publication)
    I got this link http://www.addisonhall.com/caslon-1924-specimen/ , which has some
    useful scans from the book. Have a look at the rest of the site, well worth a
    visit.\r\n\r\nNot among these scans is the fold out A2 specimen sheet - a facsimile
    of the original 1734 poster - a quick digital of which I have attached. I can
    scan it if you would like - too big to post here of course.\r\n\r\nI'm not selling
    the book by the way, and I do wonder how much Samaritan type Caslon sold - not
    to mention Syriac![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caslon_5996.jpg]"
