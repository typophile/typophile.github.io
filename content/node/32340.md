    whatever typeface they want for their players. Generally it will be a Grotesk
    like Helvetica, though I've seen Arial and Futura used too.\r\n\r\nAs for mobile
    phone OS fonts - they will usually be proprietary to the phone company, e.g. Nokia
    Sans and its bitmap counterpart designed by Erik Spiekermann.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    point ) if you mean the type used printed on the buttons, for the logo, or for
    the parts that light up - or whatever. Be as specific & thoughtful as possible.
    AND it would be a good idea to post an image if you want a type to be identified.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I first read the title of your question I was keen to read the rest & to help
    but after I read how unspecfic the question was I thought to myself. 'Why can't
    she be asked to think this question through a bit better?' And then I thought
    'If she can't be asked - then neither can I'.\r\n\r\nIf you ask lazy unspecific
    questions in future I wil ignore them. If you ask careful specific questions I
    will try to help."

    this question through a bit better?\"</cite>\r\nI think you mean:\r\n\"Why can't
    she be ARSED to think this question through a bit better?\"\r\n\r\nI have heard
    a few non-English people mistake the UK term \"arsed\" for the southern English
    pronunciation of \"asked\". It was first brought to my attention when I lived
    with a Greek man who tried to pick up local expressions.\r\n\r\nSo, If she can't
    be ARSED - then neither can you, right?\r\n\r\nArsed is from arse (ass, bottom,
    buttocks, posterior - whatever)\r\n\r\n\"I can't be arsed\" doesn't actually make
    much sense but that's the correct term. It means \"I can't be bothered\", I once
    heard that it comes from \"I can't be bothered to get up off my arse to ... [whatever]\"
    but I don't really know and I can't be arsed to Google it."

    Martin McCabe (John Bird) is always saying 'I couldn't be asked'. Or at least
    that how it sounded... Is it possible that the modification is a joke about his
    character being upper class, public school etc? Probably not. Probably I just
    mis-heard it."

  body: And Miss Giggles -- I'd like to add to Eben's comment that some people messaged
    me offboard that they are not exactly happy with your behaviour on these boards.
    Maybe it's time to take a long hard look at <em>what</em> you ask for, <em>how</em>
    you ask for it, and how you <em>react</em> to some of the replies. Everybody here
    does this for free, to help people, so it's understandable if they're not very
    pleased when they feel like they're been taken advantage of. Always be careful
    with what you're getting for free.
