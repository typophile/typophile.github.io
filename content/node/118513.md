  body: "Excellent website, the width and clean lines of Proxima Nova highlight that
    this is a car for smoothly moving at speed along the open road, as shown in in
    at least one version of the website http://www.teslamotors.com/en_CA BTW the sub-pix
    add to the message that this is electric and there ARE charging stations.\r\nArial,
    shown at small scale, is OK for for technical details. It's well known and reassuring.
    Suggests there is nothing bizarre about this car.\r\nDon"

  body: 'Thank you for your replies. I think Tesla is a remarkable brand, and the
    website reflects that. However, I would have expected them to use a less predictable
    font than proxima nova. Considering their logo for instance, which is somewhat
    "futuristic". But then, it all looks consistent and gets the message across. '

  body: "I think the font choice and typography is perfect; sophisticated and clean
    and reflecting the company's focus on engineering, quality and style. \r\n\r\nI
    think it's a mistake to believe that because a company is innovative that they
    need to employ a \"less predictable\" font. I would be curious to know what you
    think would have been strong alternatives, as it's not clear to me what you mean
    by \"less predictable.\""
