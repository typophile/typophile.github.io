body: "Well - I've encountered stylistic problems, but all-in-all I love type creation.
  The 'f','h', and 'm' are going to be hard on this one. I'm also slightly scared
  of the 'k', but a small part of my mind tells me that the 'x' and the upright has
  created a beautiful one.\r\n\r\nI don't want this typeface to be a display face,
  I'd like people to type with it, although I do understand that it will probably
  be used for 'acoustic soundsystem' or 'cool booty' posters.It is my job to make
  more of it!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeSample1_3635.jpg]"
