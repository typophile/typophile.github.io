Hello all,

I've had a check through previous posts but not found this exact topic, please redirect me if there is.

So what is your chosen version of Helvetica? Or should I say Helvetica Neue (as most people will be using as opposed to the original digit 'cut').

From working at various design agencies, studios, other people's computers etc I have probably used every version of Helvetica going. There are many, plus now we also have Christian Schwarz's digitized Neue Haas Grotesk to content with. But is it possible to advise and settle the issue? Is one foundry's version objectively the best?

Please discuss!

Thanks,

Lewis</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Lewis, if anyone is qualiﬁed to make a “best of” decision, it would appear to be you, as you have worked with so many Helveticas. So why you asking?!

IMO, working with a typeface in a layout app, developing a document design and then seeing it in print/on screen is the best way to assess a face, rather than just seeing it around output in other designers’ work.

What’s your opinion, and why?

Sorry Nick, I don't have many examples to hand on file from past work, and I don't have the versions I used on other machines of course. But I do remember giving a good study at the time. I noticed slightly different x heights and different variations for the same corresponding weights. Because of the weight issue, some worked better a smaller sizes and others as large/display. As Frode mentioned, there were other factors, like language support, which wouldn't affect me as everything I've done is in English (well, once in German). 

So I guess what I wondered is maybe someone had already looked into the specifics of the different versions. I like the Linotype cut, but I really like the sound of Schwarz's Neue Hass Grotesk so hopefully one day I'll either get that or have an opportunity to use it. But what I really need to look into is the main differences between Linotype and Adobe versions. I know I should have before raising this thread!

I didn't know about Unica, but made for interesting googling thanks. Sounds a little bit like the efforts made with aforementioned Neue Haas Grotesk remake? 

But in being the mighty, ubiquitous typeface that it is (I wrote a chapter in my university dissertation looking at the topic of globalisation and helvetica, or rather the global usage of it) it seems odd that it isn't easy to settle on a "definitive" version of it, at least out of the popularly available versions (as I imagine there is a theoretical debate about what constitutes a "definitive" version of it).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't disagree. What I mean to do is put the question out as a hypothesis. If the simple answers is "no" then the next step in the hypothesis is whether there are strong factors/reasons why one version might be better for specific uses than another. Right now, just saying it is personal taste leaves it open and somewhat chaotic. There must be more concrete and informed opinions and reasoning towards preferences in different versions of Helvetica? For a more potent example, take a look at the issues with Garamond, and how much fuss the ITC cut caused. There isn't the same situation with Helvetica, but I am sure there is a lot to be said about the pros and cons of one version over another.</div>

No, I think you shouldn’t. ‘Neue Helvetica’ is the right name. The decision to put ‘Neue’ behind Helvetica is a font menue sorting issue. Unfortunately, fonts do not have such a thing as a ‘sorting name’ by which both Adobe Garamond and ITC Garamond would be automatically sorting under G. And Helvetica and Neue Helvetica under H. Another thing is that PostScript fonts did not allow numbers in the font names. So Frutigers number system, which Stempel (they took care of the Linotype library those days) had adopted for naming the weights of many other new /re-designed families such as Janson Text, could not be used in the font menues. The Mac 4-style family strategy was ‘chosen’ instead. Shit happens.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Issue 83 of <em>Eye</em> magazine is a must for Helvetica obsessives.

Art director Simon Esterson sets the entire editorial matter of the magazine in a different typeface each issue, and for #83 it’s Neue Haas Grotesk.

What makes it really interesting—apart from seeing such a typographic <em>tour de force</em> with Helvetica on many different kinds of paper stocks—is the feature on Massimo Vignelli, which reproduces some of his work with Helvetica in complete-page reproductions.

Since Haas Unica originally came out for phototypesetters in 1977, I would have thought that the design was no longer protected even in Europe, just as Optima and Palatino are able to be copied. So I am surprised there are not imitations of it all over the place, given that it is felt to be Helvetica "done right".

The typeface [[https://www.behance.net/gallery/Heltar-Typeface/2634625|Heltar]] was referred to in one place as a Haas Unica redraw, but I don't know how accurate that is.</div>
