  has probably been discussed several times but couldn't find anything! Sorry!\r\n\r\nQ:
  I want to have all my fonts added to my font management software and I want illustrator/photoshop/indesign
  to be able to auto-active fonts when they are needed. E.g. I open a document using
  Elsner Flake Futura then I want it to be auto-activated. I also want the font tool
  to auto-update indesign/photoshop/illustrator when I am activating a font in the
  font management software. I am using Mac OSX.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

    inundated with more information than you probably want. :^)\r\n\r\nI believe the
    big 3 have auto-activation, not sure if all do it for Photoshop. I've used auto-activation
    in Font Agent Pro and Font Explorer and found that I really prefer to activate
    things myself. But, to each there own. :^)"
