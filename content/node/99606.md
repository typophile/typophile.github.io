  body: "thanks, the lower case g and the lower case f don't match though.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    maison neue is similar as well. But again, the lower case c is much more open
    in the typeface used in the book here by Ludovic Balland, and the lower case f
    don't match either...\r\n\r\nWould be great to have more ideas, thanks!"

  body: "Ludovic Balland's website states \"LUDOVIC BALLAND TYPOGRAPHY CABINET\" and
    the business case for (Editorial >) BUCHNER BR\xDCNDLER says \"typeface: plain\"
    so may be it would be not so hazardous to consider it as a bespoke typeface created
    by Ludovic Balland Studio. The same \"plain\" has also been used for \"BARENTS
    LESSONS\" editorial. "
