  body: Hi Radu, TIF images don&#39;t show up on the Typophile Boards,  <BR>only RGB
    GIF or JPEG. You might want to read the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/83.html?1111740470"

    <BR> <BR>At first sight this doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s based on any existing  <BR>font,
    but drawn from scratch. Let&#39;s see if our script experts  <BR>can come up with
    something similar.

  body: The style of &#39;r&#39; is relatively unusual in flowing scripts, and I think
    you will have to draw your own, but another alternative with quite similar loops
    could be Rob Leuschke&#39;s &#39;Corinthia&#39; from Bitstream. This sample is
    of the older version with smaller numerals &#40;Script Font ID Guide, Part 7&#41;
