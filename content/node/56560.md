  I can give people when networking and that I can leave around places I visit to
  hopefully drum up freelance business.\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\n[[http://i41.tinypic.com/2lx9lc0.jpg|Business

  body: "Front - good & minimal\r\nBack - not so good\r\nThe all lower-case Avant
    Garde - is that what it is? - is just too difficult to read, it's too hard to
    differentiate the letters (shapes are too similar) and the lines seem to blend
    into each other too easily. Try a different font or using mixed case or even spacing
    the different lines of text further away from each other."

    think I'll use the cropped a as my logo, too. I just redesigned my resume to include
    it."

  body: "I would go a couple of points smaller for the text. \r\n\r\nAlso the sans
    you are using are particularly dull. Try something more interesting.\r\n\r\nIs
    the big purple lowercase \u2018a\u2019 a Kepler or Walbaum?\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "The big 'a' is Justus. \r\nI chose Avant Garde becasue it's very round and
    curvy and my name (in all lowercase) has lots of curves.\r\n\r\nThe point size
    on this version is 10pt. I don't want people to have to squint, though I don't
    want it to look like a big-print edition book either. A friend recommended trying
    all caps and moving my name.\r\n\r\n[[http://i42.tinypic.com/f39yk0.jpg]]"

  body: "Not all caps! All caps looks like you're yelling! Or that your font choice
    doesn't have elegant Small Caps.\r\n\r\nI liked the letter differentiation you
    had going in your 2nd posting, variation c. Much easier to read."

  body: "I think it is very nice. Clean and simple. I am not a huge fan of that shade
    of purple, but It's a nice composition. I like  to play around with Cicle, Geosans,
    Lane and Kabel when I am in need of a typeface that is round and curvy like Avant
    Garde. I am not familiar with Justus. Thanks for enlightening me. Are the lowercase
    g's as beautiful as the a's?\r\n\r\nj"

  body: "I don't mind the all-caps so much. It's not as if it's body text or anything.\r\n\r\nStill,
    suggestions for more interesting typefaces: Gotham, Neutraface, Dax or Gill Sans,
    all in light weight might suit your purpose.\r\n\r\nThe side with just your name
    on might also look good with a lighter shade of purple as the background instead
    of white.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks guys. \r\nGotham is a really nice typeface, I wish I could afford
    all the families. \r\n\r\nHere's a try in Lane with variations of a light purple
    background. I took some cyan out of the purple, too.\r\n\r\n[[http://i40.tinypic.com/2efhpa9.jpg]]"

  body: "After seeing some design inspiration I'm also throwing this reversed version
    into the ring. I think it'd be striking to have one dark side and one white side.
    I'm also playing with the idea of rounded corners. The corners get all bent up
    and stuff anyway.\r\n\r\nhttp://i43.tinypic.com/2nkng8y.jpg"

  body: "I like variation F and H the best out of these.\r\n\r\nThink I would like
    it more if the text on the back was set a little tighter (letter and linespacing)
    and if the name on the front was positioned a bit lower so it's in the vertical
    stretch of the curve of the \"a\"."
