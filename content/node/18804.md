  identify the font of my logo Coss\xE9 Designs and thought it was Caligula but its
  not--but close.  I can't upload an image because my logo image is to complex and
  large.  I have had this logo for quite some time and am unable to figure out how
  strip out the background to just leave the font.  If someone would kindly go to
  my website http://www.CosseDesigns.com and look at my Logo and identify the font
  I will be so ever grateful.  I've spent hours looking through internet sites trying
  to identify but no luck.  Thank you one and all at Typophile for your help.\r\n\r\nMona"

    the characters don't match.

  body: Thank you Patty and Paul for responding.  But, Paul wins the prize--it is
    definitely Monotype Corsiva--and yes it is stretched.  I forgot I had stretched
    it when I originally made the logo quite some time ago.  I'm sure it threw a "wrench"
    in the works in trying to identify the font.  The service that is provided at
    Typophile is top notch.  Thanks again.
