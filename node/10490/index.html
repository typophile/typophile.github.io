		<div class="commentbody">By far the most common Newspaper sans of the pre-digital era was Spartan. What you have here is an exceptionally poor cut of it, with the two-storey 'a' standing out as particularly badly done (I'm not sure which alternates were available, but Jaspert has just the one-storey). It will be hard to track down exactly which manufacturer was responsible for this butchery, but perhaps your curiosity doesn't extend quite that far.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A bit more about Tempo: <BR> <BR>It was very popular headline face for newspapers before &quot;cold type&quot; took over in the 1970s. As Raph points out, it looks similar to Spartan. Both were modeled on Futura&ndash;Spartan to a greater degree and Tempo to a lesser degree.  <BR> <BR>Tempo, like some other contemporary geometric sans, had alternate characters so you could make it look like Kabel, Erbar, Vogue, or Futura (with a one-storey a). The reason for this was undoubtably pragmatic. Most of their customers (newspapers) used other manufacturers' equipment (Linotype mainly) for setting text. Ludlow was used for headlines. By offering these alternate characters, they could offer reasonably close matches to the smaller faces set with the other equipment. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70511.gif" alt="tempo1"> <BR> <BR>The Light Italic and Medium Italic were very unusual in that they had tails on some of the lowercase characters (m, n, i, u) and other somewhat calligraphic features&ndash;even a set of swash caps. The closest I've seen to this is <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&amp;id=18&amp;subpage=viewfontspecimens" target="_blank">Neutraface Italic</a>. Tempo Italic was definitely in the back of my mind when I dreamed up <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/coquette.html" target="_blank">Coquette</a>. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70512.gif" alt="tempo2"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Mark and everyone else! <BR> <BR>Tempo was a name that was bouncing around in my head. I wasn't sure why, as I'd only really seen it in the bold condensed like you mentioned. <BR> <BR>A couple weeks ago I went to the City Museum (basically a building full of neat would-be garbage). The walls near all the elevators are covered with old printing plates and empty type cases. And I snapped this picture: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70563.jpg" alt="tempobolditalic"> <BR> <BR>So I guess that explains why I thought Tempo. <BR> <BR>And perhaps there's a chance they snatched this up from the Globe-Democrat, which no longer exists. <BR> <BR>I'm still curious as to what's so wrong with that 'a'.</div>
