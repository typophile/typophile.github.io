body: 'Hello all, <BR> <BR>I searched around before asking this question but couldn&#39;t
  find any answers so I guess I will just ask: <BR> <BR>Is there a Font Management
  program, or extensions for one of th popular ones, that allow the display fonts
  in numerous languages? I have English, Japanese and Georgian fonts and I can&#39;t
  seem to find an app that will &#34;see&#34; all of them.  Font Book is just getting
  too unweildly... <BR> <BR>Thanks for any advice! <BR> <BR>R'
