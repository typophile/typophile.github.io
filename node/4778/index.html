  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Typophiles, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know how many of you are aware what has happened in Vancouver yesterday. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because I'm a typophile regular of sorts I wanted to use this forum to inform you of some views and make mention that The GDC (Society of Graphic Designers of Canada) and members, Canadian designers alike are all in the midst of a very big mess and wish for your support in letters or emails. The address to write to is <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="mailto:design@vancouver2010.com">design@vancouver2010.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Anyone who is a member of AIGA, ICOGRADA or any other country association would be helpful in our mission because frankly this is an international issue - one that the Olympic Committee may continue to implement in the future if not stopped now.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Background: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VANOC (Vancover Olympic Committee for 2010) and Mr. John Furlong (Chair) has decided that it should be a wonderful idea to open a beauty contest for the next Olympic emblem - open to anyone 19 years of age and older. Their definition of  a &quot;professional&quot; at the press conference. They are asking for entrants to attend a design conference for a fee of $150, - the submissions are &quot;free&quot; and the winning design to be granted $25,000 - an insult for such an organization.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The 2010 Winter Olympic Committee has really launched this CONTEST to design the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->logo! I got wind of it through our GDC listserve and the news. Some senior GDC members, Yves Rouselle, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matt Warburton and Jim Skipp along with Pamela Lee attended the press <!-- raw HTML omitted -->conference. As you can imagine all hell broke loose. The press and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Olympic Committee don't get it. They think we are all hobbyists, that we run craft shops. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Canadian designers; members of the associations, we abide by strict by-laws prohibiting us from speculative work much in the same way the AIGA and ICOGRADA agree that spec work is exploitative and benefits no one. We are mounting a force to hit the press; our president, Matt Warbuton has been on the news and radio in the last 24 hours, in an effort to stop all this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can read more here: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040514/OLYMPICLOGO14//?query=2010">http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040514/OLYMPICLOGO14//?query=2010</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can see the VANOC info here: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/design">www.vancouver2010.com/design</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We look forward to hearing one day soon that the 2010 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->committee realized their error in judgement and puts out a proper RFP thanks <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to the design education of real professionals everywhere. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You know how much of an insult this is. I would appreciate that this thread not be wasted on debate of speculative work and related issues and/or whether the idea has merit or not.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simply if you support the idea that what VANOC is doing is wrong please send a letter.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As our BC Chapter Secretary, Mr Sigrid Albert, MGDC put it:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I want to register my opposition to the Olympics &quot;emblem&quot; design competition  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as well. I propose that the VANOC is a) lazy, b) cheap, and c) ignorant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a) Lazy, because they seem to believe they will save themselves time by not  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->going through a proper RFP and preselection of qualified studios. IMO, the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only way to hold a professional competition, if they must have one, is to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->select a handful of studios after review of qualifications, give time for  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->briefing and questions to each studio, establish a budget for each studio to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->submit a design, and commit to the full design development process with the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->winning studio at a price established through a proposal by the winning  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->studio, not an amount of VANOC's choosing. Sounds like a lot of work though.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Better have an open contest (and don't kid yourselves, anyone who thinks  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->themselves a designer will participate!) and sift through 1,000 entries for  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->weeks or months. But wait, what about the time it takes to establish a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->selection committee, and criteria for selection? Or let's just skip all that  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- maybe it'll be a daughter-in-law of Mr. Furlong who will make the final  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->choice? Jane has always been very artistic! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->c) Cheap, because they think they will save money holding an open  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->competition. As Mr. Furlong correctly points out, he can't pay 1,000  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->designers for their entries. But apparently he thinks that just by the sheer  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quantity of entries a winning design has got to be in there somewhere, like  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a needle in a haystack? Maybe it will be, but will Jane find it? And what  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about the process of making the emblem work with its many applications? A  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->professional firm with significant capabilities will have to be hired at  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that point - at equally significant expense which will make the original  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->prize seem rather small in comparison - to make the winning emblem &quot;work&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the very latest, a proper selection process will have to be established  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->then. Why not now? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->b) Ignorant, because of the above wrong assumptions. Ignorant, because they  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think design is a talent, is just a brief moment of inspiration, and does  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not also require education, experience, and hard work. Ignorant, because  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they are calling it an &quot;illustration&quot; (according to the Globe and Mail  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article), not a logo, a brand, or an identity.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the floor. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-t <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Since your chances of success are probably slim, you should start working ASAP on the &quot;post-disaster&quot; phase: mounting an immediate, rigorous and persistent campaign to discredit the organizers, compiling negative critiques by noted designers of the eventual logo (yes, to some extent even before a design is chosen) and airing the attack through as many channels as possible.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, Tanya. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to say that I agree with Darrel. I think that calling a spade a spade, as you say, might work against your purposes, purposes I completely support. If we, as graphic designers, are to win these people over, we won't get much sympathy or even a willingness to be heard out by calling them lazy, cheap and ignorant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->btw, I do think that it's important to write them and try to educate them a bit about all this.

		<div class="commentbody">Ricardo - I understand but that's just an example of one's person's views - one that I tend to agree with. There are many &quot;official&quot; letters being sent (perhaps I should have waited and posted one of them) but as well as personal letters from designers across Canada right now - everyone should write. I'm not spear-heading here, just wanted to get the word out to other designers who care and want to write.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Right now, it seems that VANOC is corresponding and replying some letters. Of this reply that I've read it would seem that they aren't really taking this seriously yet. If they get away with it this time imagine the ramifications in years to come, and the public's perception of our industry.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instead of critiquing ourselves how about we just start doing something - anything - what-ever you can - do it however you want - but just so something if you care enough , there's not a whole lot of time to waste here.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">good point Hrant, one I hadn't thought of. - I'll share your comment with the association.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By opening an exchange with them now I would hope that we may avoid the situation - but we may not - but having them be scared of us afterwards won't help resolve the situation now - well unless we leak the idea to protest afterwards as well - which would most likely happen in any case if this went through. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Still - we have one iron ladel - maybe not the biggest, but the fact that they are inviting *us* as professionals and student designers to submit - meanwhile very few - very very few are  able to - (by-laws) and of those non-members many have good heads on their shoulders and wouldn't work on spec. It's just strange that they would think this could fly in Canada - one of 2 (?) who have accreditation. Really if they say part of the idea to hold a contest was for us - they obviously didn't do much homework, it's hard to imagine who's running the show over there. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If they get by I fear the perception the rest of the public has - it's more a matter of respect in the end, one that hopefully could come from being proactive in a positive manner.</div>
