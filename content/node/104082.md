  body: "Most striking thing about the lettering is the use of the runic S, which
    is a strange choice given the unfortunate connotations of a doubled heavy version
    of it during WWII. Other features are the high N with a cross stroke that meets
    the rhs at midpoint and the R with very large bowel. Since this is a French movie
    you might consider Transat, http://typophile.com/node/101182,  a geometric sans
    serif typeface with the correct proportions for N and R. It has caps inspired
    by Art Deco signage \u2014 found inside the \u201CGare Maritime\u201D  ocean liner
    terminals at Le Havre and Cherbourg, in the early 1930s. Unfortunately Transat
    is too rounded. What would really help is as squared off version like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterbox/berber/\">Berber</a>
    or Compacta.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n\r\n.\r\n"

    meant. Here is about the film, from the French Wikipedia; \r\n<blockquote>\r\nMichel
    Serrault campe un inspecteur de police caract\xE9riel et imbu de son pouvoir pour
    qui il n'y a pas d'innocent. Ancien de la Gestapo fran\xE7aise du 93 rue Lauriston
    (la \"carelingue\") il se d\xE9sole que la police ne puisse employer le supplice
    de la baignoire. \r\n</blockquote>\r\nGoogle translation misses a negation; that
    former French Gestapo member is sorry the police may not use  waterboarding. "
