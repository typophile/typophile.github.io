  design is only 3-5 yrs old.  Periods are diamonds, and commas are diamonds with
  tails (to the left).\r\n\r\nAnd yes...it's simpler for me to go about ID this way,
  than asking one of the staff to call the company that made the letterhead.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ltrhd_img_4920.jpg]"

  body: Wow other than the cap M, those fonts look nearly identical. What is the history
    behind them that they are so similar

  body: " Ascender says  [[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/cantoria-regular.aspx|\"Cantoria\u2122
    Regular is Briton Ron Carpenter's 1986 take on Della Robbia, a typeface developed
    in 1902 by American book artist and type designer Thomas Maitland Cleland. Della
    Robbia, inspired by fifteenth-century Florentine stone-cut capitals, featured
    rounded, open letterforms, small wedge serifs, and some rather quirky design characteristics.
    With Cantoria Regular, Carpenter brings this Renaissance style into the digital
    age, regularizing the alphabet while maintaining its historical charm.\"]]"
