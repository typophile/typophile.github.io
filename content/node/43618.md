body: "How do you present to a client a logotype that you want them to purchase?\r\nDo
  you show them a type specimen and say \"isn't this great?\"\r\nOf course there are
  ways to set the type in an online app and show them a screenshot, which is what
  I've been doing...\r\n\r\nJust curious as to everyone's methods.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: I assume you mean a font and not a logotype? Yes, a print out of an online
    sample works. Or getting a PDF specimen sample.
