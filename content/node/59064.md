body: Hey all, I'm working on a website layout for a client and have to use the existing
  logo. I can't seem to find anything that remotely looks decent with it and was wondering
  if anyone had any suggestions? Any help or criticism on any part of it would be
  great. Thanks, and remember, the logo/tag-line must stay untouched.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hei_3962.jpg]

    \r\nIf you can convince them to let you simplify it, a one color version (ex:
    white on red), perhaps without the tagline might work.\r\n\r\nH(E)I\r\n\r\nHuman

  body: "Hey Jeremiah,\r\n\r\nIf you could loose the white border which contains the
    logo, that would help or extend the white as a header, like the red gradient which
    it is in now. Maybe extend the red (ribbon) which holds human international over
    the width of your page together with the white container. I like your lay-out,
    but classical feel of the logo does conflicts with sans serif from your design
    I think, post your result when your finished.\r\n\r\ngood luck."
