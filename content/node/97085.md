  in the 90''s, but not sure. I need to clean it up because the client doesn''t have
  a clean copy anymore. That "M" is so distinctive - it''s driving me crazy! But I''ve
  been through WhatTheFont, FontEdge and Identifont with no luck. '

    for the additional site to look for these pesky fonts.
