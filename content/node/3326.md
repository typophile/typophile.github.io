  body: ' Hello Aka, nice work and nice type face. <BR>I would like to make some reflection
    about some points. <BR> <BR>1&#41; Your symbol &#40;$&#41; it fells like a sans
    serif apparence, I think that must be follow the same felling of the rest of your
    letters &#40;serif&#41;. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Why you use a capital letter on lowercase
    &#40;e&#41;? you didn&#39;t repeat the same idea on other part, and probably fells
    like stange I think. <BR> <BR>3&#41; I think your leg on l/c letter &#40;h&#41;
    is very interesting but why you don&#39;t apply on &#40;m,n,u&#41;? <BR> <BR>4&#41;
    Take a look on your capitals about the serifs, for the exemple: the letter &#40;H&#41;
    don&#39;t have any serif, or like &#40;X&#41; all parts of the letter have serifs.
    You must uniformaty all parts to don&#39;t fell strange when combine together.
    <BR> <BR>5&#41; I don&#39;t know if is a good idea you put only a serif on &#91;&#93;,
    probably will make some confusion I think. <BR> <BR>So I don&#39;t have more coments
    to tell for now and I would like to read more sugestions from the others &#40;
    I&#39;ll wait for Hrant too&#41; to make clear better my sugestions. See you soon
    and tell me what you think about all this sugestions. Sorry about my inglish and
    if you didn&#39;t understand any part of my text, tell me. <BR> <BR>Regards to
    you and to all typophile friends / Ricardo '

  body: ' Thanks for all your comments and suggestions Santos. No problem to call
    me Aka ;&#41; <BR>1. The $ your suggest maybe right. <BR>2. At the first time,
    I thought the e would be great if its SC like. And can make Djohar more unique
    faces. But I guess I&#39;ll work on that again. <BR>3. You are right about the
    h. I kinda like it when I designed that. But I don&#39;t know if m,n,u can have
    the same aura if I made it like the h. Guy&#39;s help me.... <BR>4. Good point
    Santos <BR>5. At the first time, I thought it would be great if the &#91;&#93;
    stay the same. I think it gave the &#91;&#93; a contemporer aura. But then,...I&#39;ll
    think about it Santos. <BR> <BR>Wow, guys it took time for me too fix this experimental
    face, cause I&#39;m still studying in college. Oh by the way Santos, the face
    still in vector format. I haven&#39;t convert it to type file. <BR>Sorry...maybe
    I can&#39;t make a sample text with Djohar... &#60;<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: 'Eka, sorry for the delay. <BR> <BR>I think there&#39;s a lot -too much- going
    on in this very pretty face, even for display use - even though I think the basic
    design could even be made into a text face. <BR> <BR>You have case-mixing, funky
    half-serifs and unorthodox structures all rolled into one. One thing you can do
    is leverage that and go to an extreme &#40;which probably appeals to your obvious
    playfulness&#41;, but Grunge is dying, so unless you&#39;re doing this mostly
    for your own pleasure, don&#39;t go there. If you want many other people to use
    the font, I&#39;d advise toning things down, but maybe providing many alternates.
    <BR> <BR>So, what to keep and what to dump? I think a good conceptual model for
    you is Democratica&#42;: it&#39;s structurally unorthodox, but manages to seem
    both authentic as well as &#42;natural&#42;. I think the secret is the finish:
    it has the superficial appearance of a normal font - so I think you need full
    serifs everywhere on Djohar, but you should use funky structures to make it unique;
    this might include UC forms, but don&#39;t use them gratuitously - only for a
    reason. Like your lc &#34;c&#34; is right on, but I&#39;m not sure about the &#34;e&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; <A HREF="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=89" TARGET="_top">http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=89</A>
    <BR> <BR>Some specifics in the lc: <BR>&#34;a&#34;: narrower <BR>&#34;g&#34;:
    funkier <BR>&#34;h&#34;: wonderful <BR>&#34;y&#34;: too scripty <BR> <BR>The caps
    present an interesting problem: since they&#39;re used a lot less &#40;about 5%
    of text&#41;, you have a lot more freedom, so you might want to make those structures
    especially funky - but make sure they&#39;ll still work harmoniously in all-caps
    setting - it won&#39;t be easy. Specifically, I think your UC &#34;M&#34; is super,
    but as sexy as that &#34;S&#34; is, it&#39;s too much here. Overall, your caps
    need a lot more work than the lc. <BR> <BR>Other glyphs: your &#34;?&#34; is delicious;
    the &#34;&amp;&#34; could be much stranger. <BR> <BR>One last thing: your contours
    are wobbly, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a bad thing here. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    I turn it to type format. But I guess I should turn it first to see what happen
    next. The caps need a lot of work. I agree. Other suggestion too. I think I need
    to be more focus next time. <BR>btw thanks Hrant. '
