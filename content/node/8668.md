body: 'Hi all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on my own identity and decided to challenge
  myself with my first script signature. <BR>I initially drew this and then scanned
  and traced it. It directly translates to &#34;In the wind&#34; which is something
  I wanted to show in the typography. <BR> <BR>I have a few things in mind that I
  think need to be fixed: <BR>-I dont think the weight is consitent, I am wondering
  where I should thicken or thin, I think I should aim for thicker since it will be
  used as a logo. I think my first letters work better. <BR>-I&#39;m not sure about
  the thickness of the l to the right, is my t too thin? etc, etc. <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
  appreciate any input you can give me. <BR>I attached both .jpg and .swf files. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks for your time, <BR>Emilie <BR><!--attachment: danslevent1-63021.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*2.6*Dans+le+vent+signature*danslevent1%2eswf

  body: i&#39;ll let others pipe in with a more technical critique, but i just have
    to say that i love the feeling of &#34;spontenaiety.&#34; I think it goes very
    well with your meaning of &#34;in the wind.&#34; <BR>I think you have a fairly
    good feel for your thicks and thins, just take a look at your letters and try
    to make sure that they have a &#40;somewhat&#41; consitent axis concerning your
    thicks and thins. Also it seems to me that the &#34;Dans le&#34; part is plenty
    heavy while the &#34;vent&#34; part is a bit lighter. However, I think i like
    the &#34;vent&#34; better than what precedes it. Anyhow, enough of my rambling...
    G&#39;luck with it! Oh and perhaps you might want to duplicate your above post
    to the &#34;Logos Critique&#34; section, there are some great eyes that haunt
    that section, dunno if they&#39;ll find your posting here.

  body: 'Here is an update, <BR> <BR>I wasn&#39;t sure at first about Paul&#39;s comment
    for thinning but after messing with it, I was more convinced. I think it will
    help improve legibility at small sizes which is nice. I worked on thinning the
    letters and getting more uniformity with my thick and thins, baseline and heights.
    I also tried to change the s a bit so it wouldn&#39;t look like a &#34;y&#34;
    &#40;got the comment from 2 people now&#41;. <BR> <BR>I know this needs more work,
    any other pointers would be very appreciated <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
