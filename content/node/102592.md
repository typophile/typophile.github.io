  Feliciano for use in a project:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.teff.nl/fonts/geronimo/index.html\r\n\r\nIt
  is a very expensive, high-end typeface. Yet I have not been able to find any review
  of it, nor have I been able to find it in use anywhere. Questions:\r\n\r\nWhat are
  your impressions of Geronimo? \r\nDo you know of any books or pdf samples that use
  it (other than the specimen sheet provided by TEFF)? \r\nAre there similar fonts
  out there that are comparable, preferable, or not?\r\n\r\nYour thoughts, wisdom,
  and recommendations are much appreciated in advance.\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\nIdris"

    far as I can see from the TEFF website, ascenders are 27.2% of the body height,
    descenders are 28%. Is that enough, in your opinion, to have a detrimental effect
    on legibility? And what\u2019s the point again of having ascenders that are longer
    than descenders? I see that you can fit in a lot more lines if you reduce descender
    height, which makes sense in typefaces like <a href=\"http://www.teff.nl/fonts/lexicon/index.html\">Lexicon</a>
    that are designed for cramped conditions. But is that a relevant factor in every
    text face (a very broad term)?"

  body: "It's not the length of the descenders per se that's the problem - in fact
    extenders nominally help readability. It's the fact that different parts of the
    vertical space are \"fighting\" for the available real-estate, and the ascenders
    -thanks to their much higher frequency*- deserve (i.e. can use) more room. And
    I think it's not just about consecutive lines not touching: there's what I call
    \"apparent leading\" and the need to make long lines (that actually aren't very
    close) easy to read. It's pretty rare that people -or at least people I consider
    to be good designers- use more leading than they need. Remember that page-turns
    are disruptive to reading. Sure, it's not the end of the world - it's simply sub-optimal,
    and you're not getting much benefit in return.\r\n\r\n* Although admittedly they
    actually need less room to elaborate their shapes - except for the \"f\" they're
    all sticks.\r\n\r\nI think it's quite telling that very few text fonts have such
    long descenders. Interestingly the TEFF library exhibits a high proportion of
    them, although that's mostly due to the work of Gerrit Noordzij, who seems to
    have a strong preference for making the ascenders and descenders exactly* the
    same, which to me seems unduly Modernist, and leads me to state one of my favorite
    maxims: symmetry is a lost opportunity.\r\n\r\n* Although unlike in Geronimo he
    <em>does</em> seem to factor in overshoots.\r\n\r\nNow, I certainly agree that
    different fonts target different uses, but a font also needs to be versatile,
    and when it comes to text -where the beauty of individual glyphs takes a back
    seat to their contribution to texture- it just doesn't seem like a good design
    compromise. Does Geronimo strike you as a very \"lyrical\" design that would be
    set unusually loose? To me it doesn't. And really, if it were shooting for that
    atmosphere the <em>ascenders</em> would be long too! So no matter which way you
    cut it, the ascenders are ideally longer than the descenders <em>in a text face.</em>\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I was waiting for others to chime in first, but I guess -as you say- it's
    a rara avis of a font so very few people have any experience with it.\r\n\r\nThe
    first thing I should say is: I can't tell if the high price would be justified
    for you - it depends a lot on you, and I know almost nothing about you... The
    second thing I would say is that it looks like a polished design of distinct character.\r\n\r\nThe
    third thing I would say is why I'm bothering to write this post... People might
    call this a pet peeve of mine, but the vertical proportions make no sense to me.
    The descenders are <em>longer</em> than the ascenders. I believe that in a text
    face this is a no-no. Look at that \"g\": it's having too much fun, at the expense
    of the ascenders, which are much more common in text. In a \"lyrical\" text face
    (which might actually be an oxymoron) with a small x-height I might be able to
    appreciate allowing the descenders to express themselves; but Geronimo looks like
    a workhorse design <em>above the baseline</em>. It just doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of recommending something similar: I don't usually like to do that sort
    of thing, but in terms of a comparable overall atmosphere I would suggest looking
    at Fleischmann revivals. See the second article here: http://www.typographer.org/2005_06_01_digests.html\r\n\r\nBTW
    one thing I never get tired of is TEFF's wonderful online character set presentation:
    that super-wide rendering with horizontal scrolling makes <strong>so</strong>
    much sense to me. I've done something similar -if not nearly as accomplished-
    on my own site (in fact since early 2000).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Hi hrant,\r\n\r\nThanks for initiating a response thread!\r\n\r\nThe project
      is going to be Arabic intensive. The \"atmosphere\", so to speak, that I'm looking
      for is both scholarly and literary, with lots of footnotes and marginal notes.
      I'm looking for a unique Latin text font to complement the advanced classical
      Arabic font that I'm developing. The Latin font should be traditional/historical/classical
      yet modern/contemporary (not in the technical senses of those adjectives). \r\n\r\n(The
      feel of, say, Lexicon may be too contemporary for the aesthetic I'm aiming for
      -- I looked at pdf samples of the ESV Study Bible -- which has many of the kind
      of layout technicalities I will use. But I'm still thinking about it.)\r\n\r\nOne
      of the things I like about Geronimo is its hybrid Dutch/Spanish feel. Spanish
      aesthetics, of course, are often a natural complement to Arabic, given the long
      historical connections between Spain and the Arabic world (the 'c' carries at
      least a hint of that complementarity). Yet, at least at this stage of my development
      of typographical sensitivity, I have generally found the technicals of Dutch
      typefaces (e.g., the DTL collection) most impressive. \r\n\r\nIt is interesting
      that you mention the 'g', because that is the letter that stood out to me the
      most in terms of the aesthetic I'm looking for. But as you point out: The individual
      letterforms are not as important as the overall texture produced by the font
      in action. Hence my desire to see it in action somewhere.\r\n\r\nAbout the ascenders/descenders:
      In the context where Arabic and Latin are mixed, a bit more leading for the
      \ Latin is needed, so perhaps that ameliorates at least some of your concern.
      In side-by-side translation, Classical Arabic is much more economical and efficient,
      in terms of semantics, than Latin. So it takes up to twice as many lines of
      translated text to match the original number of lines in the Arabic. I'm curious
      as to how Geronimo would compare to, say, Caslon in such a situation.\r\n\r\nThank
      you for the reference to Yves' article. I took a look at the sample of Eudald:
      Feliciano's Eudald Text and Eudald Microplus fonts look worthy of a closer look,
      but it seems that Feliciano has taken them off the market, and only the Gran
      version (Eudald News) is available for purchase.\r\n\r\nIdris"

  body: "Interesting - I think the case for using Geronimo just got stronger! Although
    mixing Latin and Arabic is always a pretty complex animal, and I can see pros
    and cons: on the one hand mirroring Arabic's rich descender space is a great idea;
    on the other hand -as you say- there are issues of economy, and those might require
    a Latin with a strong x-height (which comes first at the expense of descenders).
    Fuller reply soon...\r\n\r\nThomas, about the spurs: I'm assuming they're coming
    from the original Gil fonts. Capitals are a place you can get away with mannered
    stuff like that, although on a common letter like \"U\" it might be a bit much.
    BTW the one on the \"J\" reminds me of the interesting argument Smeijers made
    in \"Counterpunch\"; but if that's what Feliciano was thinking he would have done
    it on the lc as well.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
