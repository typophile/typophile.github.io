    copy) of Monotype Plantin. I have compared these two closely--for all intents
    and purposes, they are identical. If you want authenticity, buy Plantin. Though
    if you have one of the Bitstream monster CDs already, then you have Aldine 721
    on the cheap, so just use it and be happy.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, \"Linotype
    Plantin\" is the same as MT, they simply cross-licensed years ago, back when Plantin
    was a popular typeface in the newspaper industry.\r\n\r\n\"News Plantin\" is a
    condensed version of Plantin, approximately 20% condensed, with tighter letterform
    tracking as well. It is very close in look and feel to good-old Times Roman and
    Times New Roman, as well as Dwiggins' New Caledonia. The Bitstream clones of Times
    and News Plantin are the Dutch faces, I forget the specific numbers.\r\n"

    differ quite a lot, as you can <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/4806\">read
    in this thread</a>.\r\nAlso, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/17814\">Aldine
    721 is \u201Cslightly narrowe[r]\u201D</a>.\r\nThen, <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/HiddenGems/Plantin.htm\">Plantin
    has some more weights</a>, if that\u2019s of interest.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aldine-721_5813.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Plantin_3756.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aldine-721-Italic_5130.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Plantin-Italic_4238.png]\r\n\r\nA
    clone, as in copied outlines? Rather not.\r\nA blatant copy? Well, others might
    say \u2018just another boring revival/reinterpretation\u2019. One thing is for
    sure;: When the Monotype Corp. was founded, the eponym was dead for 300 years,
    and Bitstream came another 100 years later. C. Plantijn might not be happy with
    either of their versions."

    this, in both italic and roman versions. There are **slight** differences with
    the numerals, OK. Yawn.\r\n\r\nTo me, a typeface clone refers to look, feel and
    usage. I don't design typefaces, I could care less whether the end result is from
    outline copies, or a mere inspiration. You seem to get excited about the nuances,

  body: "Ryan, \r\n\r\neven my mother can tell that Aldine 721 and Plantin MT look
    different, though she is not able to be as precise as to say that the Aldine vertical
    strokes are even in rhythm, whereas Plantin has more of an oldstyle beat. \r\n\r\nI
    myself prefer Bitstream's version -- it has a more solid color, better spacing
    and is overall a better text typeface. In fact, it is one of my favorite text
    faces of all times. \r\n\r\nI used to think that the Bitstream versions are \"blatant
    copies\" and pitiful clones, obviously inferior in quality, until I came to realize
    that when the digital versions of many classic typefaces were made,  Linotype,
    Monotype and Bitstream all digitized the faces in a certain hurry, using somehow
    primitive equipment. The difference was that Linotype and Monotype owned the trademarks
    but they also had constraints resulting from the fact that those faces have undergone
    multiple adaptations for photo composition so often the latest drawings had little
    to do with the metal originals -- and you were never sure what was the basis of
    the digitization. \r\n\r\nBitstream did not have the trademarks but they did not
    have the said limitations either. Also, keep in mind that in that time, Bitstream
    operated under the typographic supervision of Matthew Carter, and that some designers
    such as Hermann Zapf consulted on the Bitstream versions of their Linotype designs.
    Others such as Adrian Frutiger did not approve of the Bitstream digitizations
    but in 2003, Linotype officially approved the Bitstream versions of Frutiger's
    faces such as Frutiger (Humanist 777) and Univers (Zurich) along with other designs
    including Helvetica (Swiss 721), Times (Dutch 801), and many others. \r\n\r\nSo
    from the licensing point of view, Swiss 721 by Bitstream, Helvetica LT by Linotype,
    Helvetica by Adobe or Helvetica by Apple are just four different *licensed* versions
    of the same design. \r\n\r\nIn case of Aldine 721, I don't think that Bitstream
    ever signed a similar agreement with Monotype, but as Florian pointed out, both
    Plantin and Aldine 721 are revivals of Christophe Plantin's punches. As I said,
    in this particular case I prefer the Bitstream face over the Monotype face, but
    there are cases where my typographic preferences are the other way around. \r\n\r\nBut
    one thing is for sure: many text faces in the Bitstream font collection are of
    solid typographic and technical quality -- just like many among Linotype's and
    Monotype's offerings. And, there are some poor faces in all these libraries as
    well. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    them and so on. MT messed up a lot of fonts in the early days, softwarewise.\r\n\r\nAnd
