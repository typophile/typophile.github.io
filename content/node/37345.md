  changes, all pertaining to the hyphen. It has either been omitted and the words
  left as two separate entities (ice cream), or the two words have been joined into
  one (pigeonhole). The AP is running a story which blames the internet and cell phones;
  and modern design.\r\n\r\n\"Another factor in the hyphen's demise is designers'
  distaste for its ungainly horizontal bulk between words.\"\r\n\r\nSo what do you
  think, typophiles? Is the hyphen dated and unattractive or just misunderstood by
  an eager-to-communicate generation?\r\n\r\nThe AP story can be found [[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070921/od_nm/britain_hyphen1_dc;_ylt=ArHzlsg3leMV5A86tgZvZuqs0NUE|here]]."

    ugly or bad.\r\nI have no problem with hyphens and hyphenation in texts, in my
    eyes they are not unattractive."

    \"the steady evolution of the language seems to favor union: two words eventually
    become one, usually after a period of hyphenation.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the rejection
    of the hyphen on aesthetic grounds, I started a <a ref=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/28902\">thread</a>
    to disprove that a while ago!"

  body: The hyphen is not likely to go out of fashion when used as you thoughtfully
    illustrated with "eager-to-communicate generation." That is, hyphenating is an
    accepted (and, some would argue, requisite) method of identifying a <strong>group
    of words</strong>--one or more of which is <em>not</em> an adjective--used as
    a group adjectivally.

    terms like "pin money" and "hobby horse" can be pinned on the internet & celphone
    generation...

    a fashion that failed to stick, and hanging on to them can be pretentious.\r\n\r\nI
    also agree with Nick\u2014hyphenated phrases are a good way to identify words
    used as a group adjectivally. They\u2019re especially useful for making hasty
    internet communication more comprehensible."

  body: "A hyphen might not qualify as a pigeonhole*, reports of its death are premature,
    still used for compound adjectives and it has migrated. The second thing I do
    when preparing a text provided by an author for setting is to search and replace
    spacehyphenspace to spaceenspace (I know this a British use, presumably something
    similar is required to accommodate other uses); the first is to replace double
    word spaces. The main concern for designers is, I believe, the other use of hyphens
