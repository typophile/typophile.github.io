body: "OK, so I building some new pieces for a client. I request a hi-rez version
  of their logo for the pieces and they email me a 1200dpi jpg of a logo that has
  obviously been photocopied and faxed repeatedly for several decades. I would like
  to rebuild it but can't seem to come up with font. I pulled the letters out of the
  logo and rebuilt parts that were beat up.\r\n\r\nAny one recognize this? All else
  fails I will just rebuild the whole thing from scratch but just laying in a font
  is much easier if I can find it.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text_6162.jpg]"

    it thru both WhatTheFont and Identifont and neither had any results that were
    even remotely close to the correct font."
