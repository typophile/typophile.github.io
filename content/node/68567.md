  body: "Given the examples, this one seems a typeface specifically created for embroidery,
    it's unlikely you'll find an exact digital match (for example, the upper case
    is constructed like a swash italic serif, while the lower case seems a monolinear
    script).\r\n"

  body: "Yes, you are correct in that this is an embroidery font. I am only interested
    in the upper font. I have a client that was to do products other than embroidery
    and was hoping this was an old closet font. I really dont want to have to re-create
    this one from scratch..lol\r\n\r\nThanks you for your help so far.  Does anyone
    know of a font even remotely close to the uppers?"
