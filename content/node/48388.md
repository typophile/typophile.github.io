  Kent Motor Company</a>\r\n\r\nYes, this millenium has just started and I'm not a
  designer (which apparently means that I'm not really entitled to an opinion {grin}),
  but this icon for a local car dealer is as horrible as it is hilarious.  This snip
  is from their website, but their local billboards are, if you can believe it, even
  worse. Surely this is an avatar of the Apocalypse.\r\n\r\nDFW of DFW"

    you point at poor people's clothing and laugh?  There's plenty of bad design made
    by design firms - it seems a more worthy target.\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"
