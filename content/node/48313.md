  - US as well with the same results), and every time I try to use any of this set
  of Chinese fonts, Adobe apps crash. Interestingly, Fireworks, which was not originally
  made by Adobe handles the fonts fine. MS Word on Windows also has no problem. But
  Illustrator, InDesign, and I believe P-shop and Flash as well all bomb on startup
  if the font is activated. Can anyone take a look at one of the fonts and tell me
  why this happens, and how it can be rectified?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sino.uni-heidelberg.de/edv/fonts/HDZB_75.TTF\r\nhttp://www.sino.uni-heidelberg.de/edv/fonts/HDZB_86.TTF "

  body: "Microsoft's font properties tool reports a copyright notice 1994-1997, and
    lots of information missing from HDZB_75.TTF.  In particular, the Supported Unicode
    Ranges and Supported Code Pages both report \"Information not available in font.\"
    \ So I'm not too surprised Adobe apps. don't like this font.  The Font Encoding
    Type is given as Big-5, which is unusual for a font with simplified chars., but
    the number of chars. (8,435) is about what one would expect from a GB font (i.e.,
    usually simplified) of that vintage.  The Heidelberg website says HDZB_75.TTF
    is a Kai-style font in medium weight.  The Adobe Kaiti Std that comes with the
    CS3 package is similar in style, and would be a much safer bet.  I'd avoid this
    font.\r\n\r\nHDZB_86.TTF is a more decorative font without an Adobe equivalent,
    but I expect you can buy something similar from the Arphic or Dynafont libraries.
    \ Note that I did not install either: I'm very wary of installing free fonts anyway,
    but especially outdated East Asian fonts.\r\n\r\nDavid"
