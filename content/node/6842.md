  to announce an upcoming sculpture exhibit that focuses on landscape/building. The
  design is approved but i think the forum can make it better.  The idea is to suggest
  spatial depth, implied movement, transgression of boundaries or edges. Thanks!<!--attachment:

  body: You might want to put &#34;Borderlands&#34; right on the edge of the card
    &#40;the border, you might say&#41;, maybe even let a little get cut off. Make
    it nice and big.  <BR> <BR>You might also want to play with putting the 4 names
    along the various diagonal axes suggested by the illustration.  <BR> <BR>And while
    I presume there will be more complete information on the other side of the card,
    it wouldn&#39;t hurt to put the place and maybe the dates right on the front.
    Maybe somebody will post it on their door, and you want the reader to know where
    to go!

  body: Thanks for the feedback Steve, i love the idea of reinforcing borders by placing
    type along the edges. I&#39;ll work on that. <BR>I was told to not put anything
    but the name of the exhibition and the artists&#39; names on the front side, all
    other info. goes on the back side&#40;left half&#41;.

  body: I like them. Now try pumping up the size of &#34;Borderlands&#34; and putting
    it in the extreme top left , with the B almost getting cut off by the left side,
    and the tops of the letters amost getting cut off by the top. You might have to
    put the names of the artists along the bottom, even allowing the descender of
    &#34;y&#34; in Riley to get cut slightly &#40;or you could keep the angle you
    have on the top card, and put Adam right at the bottom, and then the leg of the
    &#34;y&#34; almost runs parallel to the right side&#41;.

    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>It conveys the notion of `border&#39; quite nicely. Maybe bring
    Borderlands down just a hair, but not too much.

  body: kylie do me one favor. Borderlands 4 Installations looks like one thought.
    If it is leave it alone but if its Borderlands &#40;One thought&#41; 4 Installations
    &#40;Another thought&#41; please add some more separation. Either make the weight
    of 4 Installations lighter or  maybe its Italic or my favorite add some space
    between the thoughts.

  body: great....the printshop can&#39;t produce the gradient blend effect that is
    applied to the design. Did anyone encounter similar situation?

  body: Ugh. This was a dissapointing thread. Getting better, better, great, CRAP!
    client chickens out. &#42;sigh&#42;. <BR> <BR>When they say they can&#39;t do
    the gradient, what do they mean? Is it your file, or they just can&#39;t do gradients,
    period? <BR> <BR>You could try and see if they&#39;d run a split fountain for
    you...wouldn&#39;t be quite what you were after, but might work.

  body: Kylie, what did you use to layout the postcard? InDesign or Quark. I guess
    it doesn&#39;t matter, but here is what I would do. If its InDesign contact Adobe
    and they will give you a name of a service beauru near you who can rip your files.
    I would also do the same thing with Quark.  <BR>What the real answer is the print
    shop doesn&#39;t want to spend the time or engery to do it right. I&#39;ll bet
    they low-balled the quote.

  body: originally, I used photoshop to create the background image and saved it as
    a TIFF file for layout in Quark; later, i was asked to re-do the background image
    as an Illustrator EPS file; still, the print shop told me they can&#39;t separate
    the colors correctly and they&#39;ve suggested to use the color copier as a final
    solution.  <BR>btw. I found this about color copiers <a href="http://www.esicopiers.com/FAQColor.htm#Intro"
    target="_blank">http://www.esicopiers.com/FAQColor.htm#Intro</a> <BR> <BR>derral,
    if i have a final say, i wouldn&#39;t have chosen the old design either =&#40;
    i guess i&#39;ll use the later one for my own portfolio. <BR> <BR>thanks all for
    helpful inputs, esp. Steve! =&#41;

  body: Kylie there is no way they should have a problem with an Illustrator EPS file
    try finding a service bureau to rip your film and then give them the film.

  body: I guess this would have gone to press now, but was this a two spot colour
    job? Judging by the PDF, the type and cream background was produced using two
    spot inks, but the gradient was CMYK process, which would add four extra plates
    I assume hadn&#39;t been costed for. I&#39;d guess the printer&#39;s problem wasn&#39;t
    a technical one. <BR> <BR>To acheive that effect, you&#39;d need at least three
    plates/inks &#40;black, brown and yellow&#41;. You would have to overprint a black
    gradient over the brown solid. <BR> <BR>Oh, and I personally prefer the type size
    and positioning they chose.
