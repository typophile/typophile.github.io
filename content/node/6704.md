  body: I strongly suspect a custom &#40;most likely &#39;homemade&#39;&#41; font
    made from the user&#39;s own printing. Such fonts are so easy and cheap to make
    that this hand-printed style is often a waste of time to locate. I have collected
    many hundreds of fonts like this in Part 11 of the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Script Font ID Guide</a>, but I don&#39;t recall this being one
    of them.

  body: However, I did some checking after posting that reply, since you had a name
    for the file. Guess what? There is a hand-printed font called Newton. It was on
    a freeware site that I found with <a href="http://www.fontseek.com" target="_blank">Fontseek</a>.
    The font file only names Fontographer, so I have no idea whose work this is, or
    even whether it is the true name of the font, so user beware. <BR> <BR>I guess
    I have a new addition for my Guide.
