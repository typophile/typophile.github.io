body: 'I need your feedback on this logo, as I&#39;m about to take Custom Art Company
  from a fun little side gig to a full time business. I have done one short print
  run with this logo, but I&#39;m willing to make changes. I&#39;m about to begin
  designing a new website and make a second print run for design promotion. <BR> <BR>The
  Custom wordmark carries a somewhat heavy burden: I design for print and web, illustrate,
  and, like you, have this fetish for typography, particularly hand-lettered type.
  I like the wordmark as a solution, and I want to convey a mark that is strong, not
  too flashy, and shaped a little out of the ordinary. Swelling with pride, potential,
  but not bloated. I wanted something that instantly said, &#34;This is not created
  from a stock typeface &#40;or one that&#39;s instantly recognizable&#41;&#34;. At
  the same time, I wanted a refined, clean, ordered finish on the thing. <BR> <BR>So
  this is where the logo stands currently &#40;plain, with full name, and with URL&#41;.
  As I mentioned, I do have some equity in it, but not much at this point. Thoughts?
  Thanks, everyone.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><!--attachment: templogo-33490.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*24.2*custom+logo*templogo%2epdf

    give that a try and re-open the PDF. Should give you a much smoother view! '

  body: I think it&#39;s great. Print! <BR> <BR>If anything, it&#39;s maybe a bit
    too much like some of the older House Industries stuff, but I don&#39;t think
    your average client would ever make that connection &#40;or even if they did,
    it wouldn&#39;t necessarily be a bad thing&#41;

  body: I am getting caught on the warped crossbar of the T, and the bottom prong
    of the C. <BR> <BR>The O is slanting downward to the right. I really dislike that.
    I think it&#39;s a bit too tall as well. The U is my favorite letter.  <BR> <BR>The
    logo is a rectangle that wants to be an oval. <BR> <BR>IMO, an ovular solution
    would be handsome.  <BR> <BR>Warp it all, or angle it. Both just bother me. <BR>
    <BR>I like the mark alone. Its very powerful. <BR>It could be that the other text
    does not feel <BR>as &#34;Custom&#34; too. <BR> <BR>Andrew <BR>

  body: 'Dylan- <BR> <BR>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re running this through the gamit even
    after you&#39;ve done a short print run.   <BR> <BR>One of the biggest strengths
    of this mark is the hand lettering; you&#39;re able to achieve a definite sense
    of independence.  I don&#39;t think the letterforms swell too much.  In fact,
    I think you&#39;re on to something unique by juxtaposing crisp edges with somewhat
    organic forms.  Every curved line seems to be balanced by a straight one.  I would
    definitely not warp it all or angle it all.  Having both is what balances it and
    makes it custom.   <BR> <BR>Keeping with the theme of independence, &#34;CUSTOM&#34;
    by itself seems the natural choice.  Its not as descriptive verbally, but I believe
    it conveys the boldest iconic message of the three.  Alone, it should work at
    smaller sizes and in more contexts. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, you&#39;re still
    left with the dilemna of not explaining enough about your company through the
    name.  However, I think the mark is strong enough that it would be worth your
    time to find creative design solutions to design your way out of this problem.  Perhaps
    the design promotion and website could be designed in such a way to strategically
    identify Custom Art Co&#39;s various services. <BR> <BR>Custom Art Co., Custom
    Art Company,  or simply Custom?  Consistency in branding yourself through naming
    could be dicey.  Audibly, Custom Art Co. has the best ring to it.  I would guess
    that Custom Art Company is what will be on the books, and then CUSTOM is most
    interesting graphically by itself. <BR> <BR>Since your website is <a href="http://www.customartco.com"
    target="_blank">www.customartco.com</a>, I would think you&#39;d want your customers
    to think of your company by that name.  Perhaps you could have &#34;Custom Art
    Co&#34; written out in addition to your &#34;CUSTOM&#34; logo.  &#34;Custom Art
    Co&#34; could shy away from being a logo element and become part of the introductory
    text of your design promotions and website. <BR> <BR>Overall, I&#39;m very impressed
    by the mark &#34;CUSTOM&#34; makes.  It&#39;d be interesting to see it scaled
    down, scaled up, reversed, and applied to a couple of promo peices.  <BR> <BR>
