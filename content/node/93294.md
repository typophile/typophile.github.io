  Chartwell</a> is a fantastic typeface for creating simple graphs. Driven by the
  frustration of creating graphs within design applications and inspired by typefaces
  such as <a title=\"FF Beowolf\" href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/beowolf\">FF
  Beowolf</a> and <a title=\"FF PicLig\" href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/piclig\">FF
  PicLig</a>, Travis saw an opportunity to take advantage of OpenType technology to
  simplify the process.\r\n\r\nFF Chartwell (<a title=\"FF Chartwell Pies\" href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/chartwell-pies\">Pies</a>,
  <a title=\"FF Chartwell Lines\" href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/chartwell-lines\">Lines</a>,
  <a title=\"FF Chartwell Bars\" href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/chartwell-bars\">Bars</a>)
  was originally released in 2011 under the <a title=\"TK Type\" href=\"http://tktype.com/\">TK
  Type foundry</a>. In 2012, it was added to the FontFont library with the addition
  of four new chart styles, the Polar Series as well as <a title=\"FF Chartwell Bars
  Vertical\" href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/chartwell-bars-vertical\">Bars Vertical</a>.\r\n\r\nThe
  Polar Series (<a title=\"FF Chartwell Rose\" href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/chartwell-rose\">Rose</a>,
  <a title=\"FF Chartwell Rings\" href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/chartwell-rings\">Rings</a>,
  and <a title=\"FF Chartwell Radar\" href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/chartwell-radar\">Radar</a>)
  is a set of new designs, which take on the form of more experimental charts. In
  an effort to make the charts smarter and more dynamic, each design reacts not only
  to the data entered, but the number of values.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ff59_chartwellmetaserif_600_6560.png]\r\n<em>FF

  body: "It makes a lot of sense to be able to create charts and graphs within a layout
    application.\r\nIf you\u2019re a publication designer, you\u2019re probably much
    more comfortable working in Quark or InDesign than Illustrator. At least, that
    was my experience."
