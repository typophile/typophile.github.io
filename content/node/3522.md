    target="_blank">Memo</a> is closer, but probably still not exact. '

  body: I think this may be lettering. Considering how common this type of lettering
    is, it&#39;s surprising there are not more typefaces in this style. Flange is
    close but it doesn&#39;t seem quite right to me. Nick Shinn&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/bold/testdrive.html?s=PAPPADEAUX&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Beaufort</a> and Jim Parkinson&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/modesto/lite-regular/testdrive.html?s=PAPPADEAUX&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Modesto</a> are also similar. There is also an older font called
    Weiss Gothic that&#39;s similar, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be available in digital
    format.

    blurt. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m with Mark on the lettering.
