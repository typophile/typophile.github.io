  body: It&#39;s a style called Tuscan Ornate, which has many varieties. My Script
    Font ID Guide has several modern revivals by Font Mesa on pages <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script05Pg33.html"
    target="_blank">33</a> &amp; <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script05Pg34.html"
    target="_blank">34</a> of Part 5. <BR> <BR>The one called &#39;Main Strike&#39;
    is most similar to your sample, I think.

  body: Actually Mike, there&#39;s a destroyed-Tuscan font called <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=109&amp;page=7&amp;text=BIOGRAPHY"
    target="_blank">Immoral</a>, which is exactly the font that&#39;s used in Mark&#39;s
    sample. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/56984.png"

  body: Yes, I could see that his sample had been &#39;messed up&#39;, but I didn&#39;t
    know if it was a graphics &#39;mutilation&#39;, or a grunged font. I thought he&#39;d
    at least want the basic style, as a starting point. <BR> <BR>Good catch Ryan.
