  body: I don&#39;t see the exact font you need, but you could try searching for &#34;hybrid&#34;
    at myfonts.com there a few with similar characteristics.

  body: Maybe this is a good time to consider getting a font utility that converts
    formats between Mac &amp; PC. I expect there are many tools besides the Font design
    applications &#40;FontLab and Fontographer&#41; that can handle that conversion.
    I know FontLab has <a href="http://www.font.to/index.php" target="_blank">TransType</a>,
    but there may be others, possibly even freeware/shareware.

  body: The biggest problem for me in the conversion between mac and PC has been the
    unpacking the .sit archives and dealing with resource forks that show up as zero
    byte files on the PC. If anyone has any suggestions, besides stuffit, I&#39;m
    all ears.

  body: 'James, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been there, and after several frustrations I&#39;ve
    managed to get the problem solved with a strange technique: <BR> <BR>1. You will
    need Stuffit Expander 7 or 7.5 &#40;I use 7.5&#41; The recent versions of this
    PC software can&#39;t be used cause you end up with the zero size. <BR> <BR>2.
    Right click &#62; Expand with options &#62; Cross Platform &#62; Save files in
    MacBinary Format &#62; Always <BR> <BR>3. Use Trantype 2 &#40;best font converter&#41;
    or the shareware Acute Systems CrossFont 3.3. <BR> <BR>This work for me. <IMG
