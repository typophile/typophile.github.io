  using Suitcase for a while and find it buggy and slow. How is Fontagents auto enabling?
  What are the plus and minuses?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "You haven't told us what operating system you're talking about but I assume
    you're talking about Mac OS X. \r\n\r\nFont Agent Pro has a few design flaws.
    One of them is that it always organizes the fonts on the hard drive its own way
    rather than having an option to leave the user's original arrangements. If it
    weren't for that, the application would be pretty good. The auto-activation is
    reliable. \r\n\r\nI personally find the other two, Font Reserve and Suitcase,
    rather useless. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "MasterJuggler is pretty useless under OS X and that's a real shame. I used
    it under 6 till 9 and it was perfect (miles ahead of SuitCase). Too bad Alsoft
    can't get their act together and build a solid OS X one.\r\n\r\nFor what it's
    worth: I use FontAgent Pro and that's pretty solid. Autoactivation works (once
    you have weeded out all superfluous and defective fonts). I also tried SuitCase
    for OS X -- selling that piece of j... should be considered a crime. The interface
    of Font Reserve is so fiendish, I couldn't stand it and wiped it of all my computers.\r\n\r\nFor
    most users with font collections in the hundreds (max) Apple's own FontBook is
    perfectly feasible. The Tiger version is okay (earlier ones sucked).\r\n"
