body: "I'm getting a type themed tattoo done this year, but I'm still having problems
  finding the right font. The idea is basically to get latin phrases tattooed around
  both of my calves in capital letters. It would be easy just to pick one of my current
  favourite serif fonts, but since this one is for life I'd like to get something
  a bit more lasting.\r\nI think I'm looking for something very classical and timeless,
  along the lines of Roman capitals. The problem is that when scaled small enough
  to be wrapped around my leg, most fonts simply arent tall enough to look good. I
  did a quick test using Trajan pro, but unfortunately the letters are a bit too wide
  for my skinny legs.\r\nSo... A good-looking, <strong>very</strong> classic font
  with \"tall\" caps and a timeless feel to it. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nIf you know a great
  font that might look good but doesn't match the keywords mentioned above, feel free
  to name it as well.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "A nice font, I'm afraid it might have a bit too much contrast for this particular
    purpose. Since tattoos tend to spread over time, I'm trying to avoid thin lines
    as much as possible. Thanks anyway!\r\n\r\nBasically I'm looking for a condensed
    version of Capitalis Monumentalis. I know this may sound like a bit of a wild
    goose chase, but I still like to think there's a perfect font somewhere just waiting
    to be found."

  body: "If the text is long and your legs are skinny you're going to have a problem
    with any font; if you push too far it's going to be illegible and/or ugly. Have
    you considered doing a spiral so you can go around the leg(s) more than once without
    needing a left margin?\r\n\r\nIn any case, what about Rialto? It's classical but
    organic, and it has a special caption weight with reduced contrast. Note: not
    the Linotype font by that name - this one: http://typophile.com/node/66155\r\n\r\nBTW,
    thin lines <em>can</em> work out:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/zara/480177291/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Oh, I forgot to add somthing to the comment of the tatoo spreading... \r\n\r\nThat
    depends on the quality of the ink and in the place where you are going to get
    your tatoo. For example: your leg's skin will remain the same size if you don't
    get fat. \r\nI would never get a tatoo on belly :P"
