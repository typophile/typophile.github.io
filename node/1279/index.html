<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi <br> <br>I was interested to see that a 'Large Foundry' have threatened legal action against Cape Arcona Fonts for a font name which is similar. And that Cape Arcona have changed the name of that font as a result. <br> <br>I wondered if anyone knows where the law stands on this kind of issue, are there any cases where this has reached court. <br> <br>As a german based firm, is Cape Arcona liable to the law as it is judged in Germany, or can it be called to account by a US firm in the US where copyright of font name is more strongly protected. <br> <br>Jim <br>===</div>

<div class=commentbody>So, don't hate the game, hate the playa? <br>__ <br> <br>Jim, I believe that's the case in the US also. <br> <br>It's a legal game of chicken, played by people with money <br>to scare the people without money. <br> <br>Speaking generally (since the practice isn't limited to the <br>type industry) it's common for firm A to threaten firm B, <br>in full knowledge that they (firm A) don't have the legal <br>grounds to win. They just know firm B doesn't have the <br>funds to engage in a long legal battle. In many instances <br>firm B would go bankrupt before they could win and have <br>their court costs paid by firm A. So firm B just has to suck it <br>up and change their behavior or compete differently or <br>whatever the issue is. <br> <br>I should finish by saying I'm all for the use of the law when <br>it's necessary to protect legitimate copyrights / trademarks / <br>trade names / trade dress / et cetera. It just pains me when <br>people can't see how to make a real living and just sue as a <br>way to eliminate competition. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I visited Cape-Arcona.com today and saw on their first page, that Cape Arcona took down their font CA COSMOLAB. <br>Folks, you know they had problems with that big font foundry (it's Berthold right?) because CA renamed his CA COSMO who was to similiar to Bertholds font COSMO. <br>And after that, Bethold claimed, that the announcement that they renamed the font is not legal and that they must rename CA COSMOLAB to some other name WITHOUT mention that to CA customes. It's insane! <br>Haha, on a sidenote, they say "thank you" to the "unnamed type foundry" that they made Cape Arcona famous for that.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Of all these instances, I can see how CA Cosmo is too <br>similar to Cosmo. I can see the argument that it could <br>cause confusion in the marketplace and be unfair <br>competition. (That said I don't get how DIN and FF DIN <br>can exist and get along together.) <br> <br>But is Omicron Delta too close to Delta or City Slicker too <br>similar to City? <br> <br>______ <br>Here's another area re: naming: <br>I worked with a creative director who once worked with <br>Estee Lauder. She explained to me that Lauder wanted to <br>trademark a product line called Beautiful, but couldn't. The <br>trademark folks said it was too common a word. <br> <br>You can see this play out. If Lauder could call their line <br>Beautiful, they could potentially prevent Mary Kay and MAC <br>and anybody else from saying their products are beautiful. <br> <br>Similarly, the agency where I worked had the same problem <br>when they were naming JetBlue. One possible name was <br>"it." They took the name (and a few others) all the way <br>through the review process and got stuck in legal because <br>the name was, again, too ubiquitous to trademark.

<div class=commentbody>> <i>Well, DIN was never really a font.</i> <br> <br>It's still a font, Hrant. It's displayed in my 1985 Letraset catalogue as DIN 16(m), DIN 17(m), and DIN 17. What would make it *not* a font? The fact that it was an industrial or governmental standard? I'm just curious as to your rationale. Quite frankly, I consider Highway Alphabet Series E (Modified) a font as well...</div>

<div class=commentbody>> [DIN is] displayed in my 1985 Letraset catalogue <br> <br>Oh yeah? Huh, I thought it was only used internally by the German highway system. So then sure, it is a font - as long as the spacing is defined too*. And I guess I'm with Joe about wondering why the FF DIN name was not an issue. Maybe because both the Letraset one and FF one are derived from the original German highway one, and <i>that</i> one is in the public domain? In the same way that there are many fonts that look like Interstate, but FontBureau can't complain. <br> <br>* If there's no spacing info, you could say it's not really a font - it's just a bunch of letters. A font is notan, not just the blackbodies. <br> <br>> I consider Highway Alphabet Series E (Modified) a font as well. <br> <br>Well, even though it's in the public domain (which is probably why the name is not protected - except it's too clunky to "borrow" anyway), since from what I know it's a bunch of letterform drawings with spacing definitions, then I guess it is indeed a font, even though it requires a human to render it by hand (the way it's "encoded") - kinda like Letraset in fact! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> <i>So then sure, it is a font - as long as the spacing is defined too</i> <br> <br>Just like all Letraset dry-transfer lettering, the character spacing is defined by little tick marks positioned at the baseline of each character. By matching up the ends of the ticks, you would approach reasonably correct letter spacing. (Subjective kerning and tracking decisions aside.) As you said, if it's 'a bunch of letterform drawings with spacing definitions, then I guess it is indeed a font...' Well, that sounds like a sheet of Letraset to me. <br> <br>g. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Considering Interstate was derived from the glyph shapes and spacing published in the MUTCD it has no right to complain about look alikes, but it does have a right to complain about pirated font software. <br> <br>The Highway Alphabet Series B, C, D, E, E(mod) and F exist both as; drawings & spacing charts, stand alone fonts and as integrated fonts in various sign creation applications. (SignCad, TraffiCad, etc) <br> <br>If the design is a typefce and the software is a font then the Highway Alphabet series exists as both, but was only published in the MUTCD as a typeface. <br> <br>James</div>

<div class=commentbody>Come on, let's use the word "font" accurately. In digital terms, how about "A software utility that sets type."? <br>That distinguishes it from a typeface. And from a page-layout application. <br> <br>Could you call a draftsman's template (Just imagine using a DIN template with a Rapidograph pen) a font? <br> <br>*** <br> <br>Also in the Highway Gothic "genre", Ray Larabie's "Blue Highway" (He must have been a Billy Idol fan...)</div>
