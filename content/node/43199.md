body: "I have something odd going on with Safari. I know I can just use firefox, but
  I'd like to figure out what's going on. I just got a new iMac, and everything was
  fine. I then added all my font files to my library, and this happened to the majority
  of the text I see in my web browser window:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_4902.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn
  my preferences, I have my standard font set to times, and my fixed-width as courier.
  Does anyone know why this is getting overwritten, how I can fix it, or even what
  this hideous typeface is?\r\n"

    you have a gremlin in your machine.

  body: Try deleting the fonts. You will have to find out the name of the fonts, and
    try to remove it. Careful, Mac OS X has fonts residing on the administrator account
    and all others in the system. Good luck.

  body: "My suggestion would be to remove/de-install the font that looks like your
    sample - if you're lucky it is the one messing up your font registry and/or be
    conflicting with your Times.\r\nIt could be the result of another font conflict,
    though, which would be worse to find out.\r\nDe-install some fonts would be my
    suggestion..."

  body: Did you delete any of the common Web fonts? Arial or Verdana for example?
    With Arial so common on Macs many stylesheets don't bother with "Arial, Helvetica"
    any more

    for the hand all!\r\n\r\nI have no idea what the font is, god knows I'd never
    actually use it. Whatthefont.com couldn't  figure it out either. Maybe my next
    post will be in the type ID board..."

    that's embarrassing, having everyone know I had that font. That's like finding

    with some people's faces arranged like the opening credits of the brady bunch...thus,
    the offending type...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For future reference:\r\n\r\nThis occurs sometimes when you add/delete a
    lot of fonts from OS X.  The best way to solve the problem, without having to
    hunt down the offending font and delete it, is to clean your font caches.  Font
    Finagler will do it 10 times for you before you have to pay for it and FontExplorerX
    will do it for you completely for free.\r\n\r\nAny time you have a weird font
    problem\u2014when this problem happens usually the text is completely illegible;
    like opening up a data file in a text editor\u2014the first thing to try is cleaning
    your caches."

  body: "Hunter, it should be under the SAFARI drop-down menu, then PREFERENCES from
    that. Choose the APPEARANCE tab. This should lead you to the fields where you
    can choose both your font <em>and</em> size. That's all I can say offhand, but
    it sounds like you've already been down that road. screenshot?\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    throw out your preferences for safari. Throwing out preferences is the solution
    to about 80% of mac problems."
