  of Learning Curve Pro (more feminine, DIY feel)\r\n\r\nThe font needs to be more
  feminine, possibly more handwritten / DIY and less retro but shrink well. The more
  weights available the more flexibility. The font needs to work at reduced sizes
  knocked out of full color backgrounds.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\r\n\r\n"
