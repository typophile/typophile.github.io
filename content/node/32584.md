    from Linotype? It's a very underrated didone. Thanks for reminding me of it.

  body: here is a sample of the font, maybe it's not basilea? this scan is from a
    design package for a chinese hotel from the 80's? is it possible that the font
    isn't used very much anymore? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Alpha_6288.jpg]
