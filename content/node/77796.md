  body: "Not necessarily. Perhaps only an identifier for the fond would be copied
    and pasted.\r\n\r\nIn a word processor, you can copy and paste text and preserve
    things like italics and boldface - and changes of typeface. Copying from a web
    browser into a word processor loses style information.\r\n\r\nThis is a technical
    issue in how browsers, which allow text on web sites to be selected, present the
    text to the Clipboard. It does not require the Unicode Consortium to get involved.
    And it would not involve copying the font."

    font piracy...k?

  body: I realized that I was mistaken as well when I saw the other thread about "monopoly".
    It isn't a monopoly because font makers want to get paid.

  body: "<em>It does not require the Unicode Consortium to get involved.</em>\r\n\r\nIndeed,
    it has nothing to do with Unicode, which is an encoding standard for <em>plain</em>
    text. Copying font identity implies styled text, just like copying italic or bold
    copying."

  body: "This doesn't directly relate to the topic of this thread, but I happened
    to be searching for documents on Google Books, and ran across a copy of the New
    Testament translated into the Multani language.\r\n\r\nI had admired an image
    of that script when I saw it in a book on the history of written language, so
    I searched for further information.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that the language, also
    called Saraiki, Derwal, or Wuch (the last being the name of the province where
    it was spoken; the first is the name usually used today) was written both with
    the script I had seen, the Lahnda script (the language was also, <em>incorrectly</em>,
    assigned to the \"Southern Lahnda\" language group) and with a variation of the
    Arabic script.\r\n\r\nHindus used Lahnda, Muslims used the Arabic script. The
    area where Saraiki is spoken is mostly within Pakistan (part of it is in Afghanistan),
    and so when India was partitioned, the Hindu speakers of Multani or Saraiki fled
    to India, in which they are scattered. Many still speak the language, but little
    is published for them in their script any longer, as they also use the language
    of the surrounding communities to which they have moved.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the
    Lahnda script has declined enough in importance that it is not yet among those
    encoded in Unicode."

    see.\r\n\r\n@oldnick - Yes, extracting the exact names of the fonts used (which
    is what I believe @javascript meant) is a huuuge piracy problem."
