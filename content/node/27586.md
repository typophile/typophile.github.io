  body: "I'm certainly no expert in this area but i think you should be able to use
    Georgia itself. If you're viewing this web page on a PC then you're probably reading
    9pt Georgia right now.\r\n\r\nI've not used Flash but i believe you can turn off
    antialiasing to make Georgia render as a pixel font like you can in Photoshop.
    I think most of the Windows system fonts were specifically designed to work this
    way.\r\n\r\nI may be wrong on some or all of the above, or i may have misunderstood
    your question. It's been a long day.\r\n"
