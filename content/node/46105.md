  similar to Casablanca, Anna, or Blakely ... but not quite.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease help!
  Thank you!"

  body: "It seems to match the old Image Club [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/arquitectura/|\"Arquitectura\"]],
    which is very close to the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/casablanca-rr/casablanca-rrcond-alt-light/|Casablanca
    Condensed Alternate]]. The main differences are the top of the A, and the extensions
    to the left of the stem, which are angled, like your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
