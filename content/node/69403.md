body: Hello fellow typophiles. Does anyone care to critique this invite I've made
  for my mother's birthday. It's 210 x 130mm, both sides shown, and I'd like it printed
  on something like 350gsm uncoated cartridge stock. I looked in foil-blocking, but
  that's proving too expensive and time-consuming, bearing in mind I need to get these
  printed ASAP. If anyone knows a way to make it a little special without costing
  the earth (e.g. metallic pink - that's here favourite colour). Colour used at the
  moment is Pantone 214, with a tint of its complement which is a process green. Any
  help would be appreciated. Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Birthday_Invite_4341.jpg]

  body: "Overall, I enjoy the design and aesthetic. I think the \"is turning\" needs
    some tuning. Make it more simple, and let \"Buffy\" and \"seventy\" stand out
    more. Remove the styling on the \"s,\" make the \"r\" more normalized (like in
    \"Picture\"), and consider turning the \"I\" back to lowercase, as it's the only
    instance in the whole design where you're substituting uppercase for lowercase.
    Also consider moving the swash on the \"B\" in a bit as it hangs out a little
    too far, and instead of having the \"n\" in \"seventy\" just drooping, try drawing
    it over to connect to the tail of the \"y.\"\r\n\r\nThe back spread looks nice.
    You could probably reduce the leading on the date/gallery title as well."

  body: "Thanks for the well-considered advice Steve. I agree about the 'is turning'
    - a bit OTT. I could just turn the small caps I into a dotless lowercase (always
    forget what they're called). Not sure I'd join the n to the y, but I could definitely
    try a right-facing swash. Thanks again for the help.\r\nP.S. Some of the stuff
    on your site is beautiful. Didn't see much, but 'Punctual' magazine looked great."

  body: "I moved the \"B\" swash in a few hairs, but I wanted to keep it on the 'golden'
    grid. I think making \"is turning\" much simpler is a marked improvement. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Buffy_Invite_02_5886.jpg]"

  body: "Ah, it looks excellent! The only remaining adjustment I notice is to possibly
    adjust the spacing on the top & bottom of \"is turning.\" It's hugging a bit closer
    to \"Buffy\" than \"seventy.\" It may be difficult since the descenders of the
    n/g, though.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comment! It's always good to hear feedback
    on work from other designers. If you're a fan of the Punctual magazine you'd probably
    like The Philosophy of Typography as well (http://www.studioimbrue.com/#philosophy).
    Good luck with your Invites."

  body: "Thanks a lot for your help Steve. I printed them yesterday on some rather
    wonderful Hahnemuhle 308gsm stock, and posted them in envelopes of a similar colour
    to the type.\r\n\r\nThe Philosophy of Typography is beautiful, and the Fire Thrice
    image is very edgy. Your box sets remind me of Joseph Cornell's work. I'm not
    just saying this, but your stuff is exactly the kind of stuff I want to do. In
    fact, it's given me a bit of faith in print again. You don't need a junior designer
    do you? ;)"

    excellent.\r\n\r\nHaha wow thank you for the compliments, they do mean a lot.
    I'm just a mere 22 years of age and I'm currently finishing up Grad School, so
    I'm not exactly looking to hire anyone. :)"
