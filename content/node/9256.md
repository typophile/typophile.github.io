  have no idea how to change the following two to DELs, can anyone help? &#40;It is

  body: 'Although they can be incredibly powerful, the contextual substitutions in
    MIF source files are extremely frustrating to write. It&#39;s one area where OpenType&#39;s
    approach is easier by many magnitudes. <BR> <BR>Fortunately, there&#39;s a much
    easier way to solve your particular problem -- just create a ligature of three
    periods in a row to an ellipsis character. For example: <BR> <BR><pre> <BR>Type           LigatureList
    <BR>Name           Typographical Extras <BR>Namecode       14 <BR>Setting        Periods
    to Ellipsis <BR>Settingcode    6 <BR>Default        no <BR>Orientation    H <BR>Forward        yes
    <BR>Exclusive      no <BR> <BR>List <BR>               ellipsis       period period
    period <BR></pre> <BR> <BR>Although it is not documented Apple&#39;s tutorials,
    you can mix contextual and noncontextual substitutions in any feature set &#40;in
    this case, Typographical Extras&#41;. <BR> <BR>Brent'

  body: To be honest I had thought of that, but figured an ellipsis wasn&#39;t a true
    ligature so i shouldn&#39;t use the ligature feature to cheat my way out :-P <BR>
    <BR>Ahh well...

  body: It also breaks when encountering strings with more than three periods, turning
    every group of three into an ellipsis, rather than aborting the transformation
    like a proper contextual substitution would &#40;i.e. &#34;...&#34; would form
    an ellipsis, but neither &#34;....&#34; nor &#34;......&#34; would&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>So I shall use the LigatureList for now, but if anyone can solve this I&#39;d
    still like to hear about it.

  body: This may sound like a stupid question, but why bother replacing three periods
    with an elipsis? I don&#39;t see what the advantage would be since, presumably,
    it would look exactly like three periods.

  body: In most fonts an ellipsis isn&#39;t identical to three consecutive periods.
    <BR>And with reason, since that generally creates a large white gap in <BR>the
    texture of the page. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I&#39;ve always made them so they look the same as three periods, spacing-wise.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve just checked a bunch of different fonts at random. Of the ones I
    looked at &#40;including some from Microsoft, Apple, Font Bureau, House, FontShop,
    etc.&#41; about half do it the same way I do, i.e., exactly the same as three
    periods. All the others put <b>more</b> space between the dots in the elipsis.
    Some as much as twice the space. Interestingly, in Georgia the dots are slightly
    smaller than the period but spaced exaclty the same as three periods, with a little
    extra to make up for the smaller dots. I have found no fonts &#40;so far&#41;
    where the elipsis is more closely spaced than three periods.

  body: Back when we were writing the <i>Glossary of Typesetting Terms</i> I researched
    this one a bit. Turns out that &#40;at that time&#41; the Associated Press style
    was to use three periods with no extra spacing. The <i>Chicago Manual</i> &#40;whatever
    edition&#41; calle for three periods with a 3-to-em space in between the periods
    -- of course, Chicago frequently got its &#34;to-em&#39;s&#34; a little off; this
    would give wider than nornal spacing within the ellipsis. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been
    known to argue both sides. Finally our company went with a normal &#40;usually
    justifying&#41; word space between the periods, on the grounds that the more word
    spaces you can get in a line, the tighter the line will usually set, and the more
    even the spacing generally. Not the best argument I&#39;ve ever offered . . .
    <BR> <BR>We&#39;ve programmed this &#34;ellipsis&#34; to prohibit a break within
    of course, and have a high penalty to break before. A four-dot ellipsis is really
    a sentence-ending period with a standard ellipsis following. One more reason to
    use the normal space. <BR> <BR>MLA style can vary from this, BTW. If it were me
    &amp; I were building a font with a single ellipsis character, I&#39;d make the
    space between the dots a bit less than the smallest justifying word space. If
    someone then decides to go the other route, they just don&#39;t use the ellipsis
    &#34;character.&#34; But if you make it a ligature and someone can&#39;t turn
    off that particular ligature without turning off all the ligatures, you do have
    a problem. <BR> <BR>FWIW, <BR> <BR>Charles

  body: Sorry I&#39;m jumping into this discussion but it&#39;s so close to what I
    was looking for for so long. <BR>Can anybody show me how to write MIF contextual
    table for contextualization of Arabic letters? <BR>Arabic letters are substituted
    by their &#39;initial&#39;, &#39;medial&#39; and &#39;final&#39; forms depending
    on their location in the word and many of them are joining characters. ftxanalyzer
    does not generate Arabic contextualization scheme in MIF file and I don&#39;t
    know how to add it to MIF before compiling with ftxenhancer.
