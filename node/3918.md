    <BR>but my radio reception is awful for some reason &#40;I&#39;m in Hollywood&#41;.
    Unfortunately KCRW only stream on the net using RealPlayer which is by far the
    worst of all the players. It invariably freezes my system within ten minutes of
    the start of a stream.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d listen to more classical if there were
    any decent net stations out there, but I haven&#39;t found anything yet that I
    like anough to regularly return to. BBC Radio 3 is very good, but isn&#39;t always
    playing music - plus it, too, only streams RealPlayer.'

  body: bbc radio 1 plays some really interesting stuff through the radio shows of
    steve lamacq and john peel in the afternoons after 1pm mountain time &#40;take
    1 hour off if your on the west coast&#41;, the only thing that isn&#39;t great
    is that it only runs on realplayer unless someone can tell me how to run it through
    itunes, i&#39;ve managed to load virgin radio so it is possible for some stations.

    SIZE=0><!-Quote-!><B>Quote:</B><P>America&#39;s fledgling Internet radio industry
    could be effectively killed on May 21st if the Librarian of Congress &#40;1&#41;
    accepts the recommendations of its recent Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel
    &#40;&#34;CARP&#34;&#41; concerning Internet radio royalty rates and &#40;2&#41;
    sets impossibly-complex recordkeeping requirements. <BR> <BR>Congress passed a
    law in October, 1998, called the Digital Millenium Copyright Act &#40;DMCA&#41;
    which established that webcasters must royalties to record labels for the music
    they play. However, the CARP&#39;s recommended royalty rates are currently more
    than 200% of most Webcasters&#39; gross revenues!  <BR> <BR>If Copyright Office
    accepts the CARP&#39;s recommendation, most observers believe that the decision
    will effectively kill Internet radio, as the retroactively-owed fees would bankrupt
    all but the very largest Internet-only webcasters &#40;and would probably trigger
    the shutdown of most broadcast stations&#39; Web simulcasts, including almost
    all the educational and community stations &#41;. <BR> <BR>Read more background
    here or in an editorial from the San Jose Mercury News.<!-/Quote-!><HR SIZE=0></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BR> <BR>From what I can gather this is regarding US legislation only, however
    non-US listeners to US stations will certainly be affected.
