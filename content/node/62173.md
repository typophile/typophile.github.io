body: "This sample seems AWFULLY familiar to me, but i just can't place it... it's
  a custom font, but it looks like it's just a slightly condensed variation of an
  existing face. It's close to Friz Quadrata and Silverado, but I think there's a
  closer match. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aa_6524.jpg]"

    familiar feel, but I can't pin anything else down that's very close. [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/Novarese/fonts/|Novarese]]
    is also a bit similar in style.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    version), Roundest, Quorum or Poppl Laudatio. \r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "Yeah, I think i was thinking of Quorum originally as the font I had, but
    seeing it now, it's not that close.\r\n\r\nMike, unfortunately, i can't provide
    the source, i'm under NDA (but the font will be featured prominently in an upcoming
    major motion picture) - ;-)\r\n\r\nOh well, I've got the outlines from a PDF,
    I can hand-set anything i need until/if they release the font itself, or throw
    a temp font together in FontLab. I don't need it just yet, but i know i will soon."
