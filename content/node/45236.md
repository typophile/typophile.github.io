  the directions in the Typowiki. I am trying to do this in OSX 10.5.2. I dropped
  the \"finish install OSX\" file into the terminal window and it seemed to install.
  But when I try the test--typing \"autohint -h\"--I don't get information about autohint,
  but rather an error message, \"-bash: autohint: command not found\"\r\n\r\nCan someone
  give me more detailed instructions or tell me what I am doing wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n

  body: 'Those instructions should work. This is a unix-y error in the shell indicating
    that bash doesn''t know about the "autohint" program. The shell keeps track of
    directories of programs it will run without specifying the full location. In unix
    parlance people refer to this as the "path". So one might say that the "autohint"
    program is not "in your path". '

    wrong with the graphics card on my 3 week old machine, so it is being replaced
    :(  So I won't get to try this till I get the machine back on Friday. I'll let
    you know how it works. "

  body: "Dear Miguel\r\nI am trying to install AFDKO and I can do it really easy with
    the\r\nAFDKO command-line tools. But I get the following message when I try to
    install the\r\nAFDKO FontLab macros:\r\n\r\n<strong> Failed to copy file /Applications/tipografia/FDK/Tools/SharedData/FDKScripts/plistlib.py
    to /Users/daro/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros/System/Modules/plistlib.py.\r\nIOError:
    [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Users/daro/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio
    5/Macros/System/Modules/plistlib.py'</strong> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing I've
    changed is in terminal, instead of dragging the FDK folder, I dragged the Fontlab
    folder (FDK/Tools/Fontlab) because I get an error message if I drag the FDK one.\r\n\r\nDo
    you have any idea about how can i fix it?\r\n\r\nthanks very much for your help,

  body: "Hi Dario, are you following the steps described at [[AFDKO]] ?\r\n\r\nTo
    install the FontLab macros you need to run a command that looks something like
    this:\r\n<code>python installFontLabMacros.py /Users/(your_username)/Library/Application
    Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros</code>"

    when I run it it chops up my glyphs leaving behind messages in the record saying
    \"element at [coordinates to coordinates] split.\"\r\n\r\nAm I doing something
    wrong? \r\n\r\nFontLab's autohinter does execute without causing such problems.
