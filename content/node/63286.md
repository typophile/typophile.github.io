body: "Typotheque has become one of the first commercial type foundries to license
  its entire font collection for use on the World Wide Web.\r\n\r\nTypotheque\u2019s
  Web Font Service frees webpage designers from the restriction of using Times, Helvetica
  and the other dozen or so \u201Cweb-safe\u201D fonts. Although most browsers support
  the use of other fonts, font companies have been reluctant to license their fonts
  for use on the web because there has been no convenient and reliable method of preventing
  site visitors from downloading the font files illegally. Typotheque\u2019s method,
  which is based on W3C standards, gives web designers unprecedented creative possibilities
  while at the same time making it simple to use fonts securely on the web.\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/webfonts\r\n\r\nTypotheque\u2019s
  system enables webpages to use the CSS @font-face rule to access font files stored
  on a global network of secure servers. Because the rule is supported by the latest
  versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Opera, over 95% of all users
  worldwide can view such pages properly. For the first time, designers can create
  consistent visual identities across all necessary media without having to convert
  text into images. Typotheque\u2019s OpenType fonts support over 100 languages written
  in Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and Arabic scripts.\r\n\r\nAll End-User Licences (including
  those previously purchased) for its OpenType fonts have been upgraded at no extra
  cost to permit font embedding in webpages using a secure proprietary system. Licensed
  users receive 500MB of free bandwidth per month per font (equal to approximately
  25.000 free views monthly); paying only \u20AC1 for each additional Gigabyte. \r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/webfonts/faq\r\n\r\nWatch
  a short tutorial, or sign up right away for 30 days free Trial licence and give
  it a try. If you like it, you can upgrade to full licence at any time."

  body: "Thank you everyone. \r\nWhat is really exciting, is that finally we can respond
    to people requesting a test font. We can give them a 30 days trial licence, which
    gives a good idea how the fonts work. Something which was impossible just a year
    ago. "
