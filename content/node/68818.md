body: "I did some concept drawings for my \"art studio/company\". The name Eggroll
  Industries dates back to high school and my nickname is Eggroll. \r\n\r\nI want
  it to look a little retro/artsy and simple so it won't detract from my art. I didn't
  buy the font yet so I can't provide larger examples. These are all roughs. I think
  the finished version I'm going to use a scanner technique or print them so it has
  a screened poster feeling.\r\n\r\nI'm using a costume to brand myself. You can see
  a photo I took of me in it...long explanation.\r\n\r\nAnyways, feedback welcome!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Heroic_condensed_thumbs1-4_3977.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/silhouette-web_5178.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/art_3872.jpg]"

    can''t get it to look more like a fortune cookie. A fun visual play? '

    fortune cookie. Also, I was thinking of using an actual fortune cookie with my
    information on it for promotion.\r\n\r\nNice observation."
