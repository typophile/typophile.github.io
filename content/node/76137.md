    no. Not all of them anyway.\r\n\r\n(I'd totally second the license/gift-certificate
    idea!)"

  body: "<em>Typophiles like type specimens more than they like fonts.</em>\r\n\r\nI
    base that observation on the trade at Type events, and the experience that typographers
    will buy a font for use in a specific job, but not so much on impulse.\r\n\r\nSo
    perhaps a licence/certificate is a good idea, because the recipient can redeem
    it when the occasion arises.\r\nBut I wouldn't suggest just giving someone a font
    as a present, unless it comes with a nice specimen, or is in a House Industries
    package.\r\n\r\nGift certificates are a bit of a cop-out, third on the scale behind
    a cleverly-chosen purchase and something you made yourself specially for the recipient."

    don't necessarily see gift certificates* as a \xABcop-out\xBB; not if it's for
    someone who appreciates presents that are useful, and has needs/wishes that are
    more specific than you could know... And you can always make a really creative
    packaging for it :-)\r\n(* I've said this last year too, but I still think more
    foundries/resellers should offer them.)"
