  is some lettering found on/in a library in Austria. These two are not the same,
  as it looks.\r\n\r\nCan you suggest any typefaces that match the above? Thanks!"

  body: "I hunted through my Serif Guide and found a typeface called [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_b/brno_z_full.gif|Brno
    Z]] by Jan Rambousek. Jaspert says this was done in 1959 by Grafotechna. I don't
    think it's identical to the larger sample, but there are similarities, such as
    the K and S, made all the more interesting by the geographical proximity of (then)
    Czechoslovakia to Austria. \r\n\r\nI also paged through the serif types in Jaspert's
    \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\", which I don't have completely incorporated in
    the Guide yet, and couldn't find anything closer. \r\n\r\nWas this lettering in
    many places in the Library? Any idea of the age of the lettering?\r\n\r\nAs you
    indicated, the LESESAAL type is certainly not the same as the top sample, but
    I have no idea what it is. It is hard to see detail, and the E is the only really
    helpful letter there.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "\r\nThanks for your suggestions. These examples are good inspiration.\r\n\r\nI
    found that <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Impressum&q=Go\">Impressum</a>
    is also quite close but the stroke contrast is too low.\r\n\r\nThe building is
    from 1930-34. I forgot to mention that. The main problem with all the fonts I
    have considered is that they are too \"perfect\" and balanced compared to some
    of the lettering from that time."
