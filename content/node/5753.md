    Heavy Condensed</a> &#40;designed in 1931&#41; is similar. The Z is probably custom.

    the numbers 2  and  4  &#40;on the box&#41; have cut corners. <BR> <BR>what about  57
    ? <BR> <BR>and <BR> <BR>&#34;The World'

  body: You should remember that the Heinz 57 brand name is much older than computers,
    so finding digital fonts that match is more coincidence and/or luck than design.
    Tempo is just similar. <BR> <BR>I doubt if you can match the 57 without a lot
    of outline manipulation to an existing font. You are better off scanning it. <BR>
    <BR>The script is pretty similar to an old Berthold script called Houston BQ &#40;see
    below&#41;, which I cannot find at Berthold any more, or anywhere else on the
    web right now. This sample from my Script Font ID Guide was provided for me, by
    another font collector. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41357.gif"

    curious. <BR> <BR>It also looks like they have blunted the cut on the corners
    of the Z.

  body: But we work in a trivial business for the most part, Yves, when we put our
    creative skills to work for commercial companies. It pains me that our profession
    has the ability to change people&#39;s minds on the environment, on issues of
    equality, poverty and so many good causes, but most of us just help to sell beans.
    <BR> <BR>Or in my case, DVDs from giant power hungry greedy studios.
