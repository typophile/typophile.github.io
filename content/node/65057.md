body: "Hello all,\r\nI have been taught that when using bolder weights of the same
  font next to lighter ones, the bolder one has to be enlarged very slightly, otherwise
  it'll look smaller. I've always wondered if that effect couldn't be offset [more]
  within the font itself.\r\nIt was a big \"aha\" effect when I realized that many
  fonts raise the x-line slightly in darker weights, to optically compensate for the
  smaller counters (and thereby the impression of the glyphs being smaller in toto),
  which seems to go a long way in offsetting the difference in apparent size.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n1)
  Is it safe to assume that at least for text fonts, raising the x-line in the Bolds
  is a common practice? Considering those that don't do it (like say Palatino): What
  are reasons against it?\r\n\r\n2) Why is, in some fonts, only the x-line raised,
  but not the ascender line [or even more rarely, cap line raised or descender line
  lowered]? Wouldn't the optical effect be comparable for them?\r\n\r\n3) And what
  about the BASELINE* itself \u2013 could/should it also be shifted downwards slightly
  in dark weights, to \"enlarge\" the x-height region from both sides so to speak?
  \u2013 The only font I found that does this is Miso (its shifting baseline was briefly
  discussed here: http://typophile.com/node/17159#comment-115945 )\r\n\r\nCurious
  as always for any opinions/comments/insights. Cheers.\r\n\r\n[* Sorry fixed this,
  brain was tangled up]"

  body: Good questions. I think the reason it's (usually) only the x-height that's
    adjusted is that the adjusting other parts (cap height, ascender height) would
    be more noticeable. The whole point is for it not be noticeable, that the different
    weights simply appear to be the same size. It's sort of like overshoots.

    Adobe Caslon Pro and Adobe Garamond Pro, each in Regular and Bold. The Caslon
    compensates both at the x- and the ascender line, the Garamond only at the x-line.
    Doesn't the ascender look shortened in the Bold Garamond? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ascenderheight_6216.gif]"

  body: "<cite>\"The bold is inevitably going to change shapes\"</cite>\r\nYes, but
    my point was to not make it change apparent <em>sizes</em> too much.\r\n\r\nNow
    you can argue that ascenders don't enclose <em>volumes</em> the way x-line features
    do, so they're maybe not as relevant wrt the resultant apparent glyph size. But
    then what about the cap line? \r\nGaramond Pro again. Why would you want to compensate
    in the lowercase \u2013 the x-line shifts by 6 units in this case \u2013 but not
    in the caps, where the Bold looks clearly smaller?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ooOO_5742.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    suspect it might really have something to do with usage context rather than just
    optical effect, but I'm not getting it."

  body: "If you show pairs of glyphs out of context, the differences will be more
    apparent.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think this is done only in the short part of the
    lowercase has to do with relative scale. When you make letters bolder, the small
    letters take on much more weight for their size compared to the caps. So the optical
    effect of adding weight (making the shapes look smaller) is more pronounced in
    the small letters. And letters like the \"s\", \"e\", and \"a\", which have a
    lot going on in them (three horizontal strokes each), are more compromised as
    you add weight. Increasing the x-height as the weight increases helps alleviate
    both of these problems.\r\n\r\nI've done this in several of my font families to
    a greater or lesser degree because of the reasons stated above. The thing that
    always worries me is the idea of someone creating a logo that uses two different
    weights side by side, where the difference in x-height would become apparent.
    Even so, I think it's the best way to handle a range of weights. I wouldn't mess
    with the cap height, ascenders or descenders because I don't think the effect
    would be as great as with the x-height."

  body: "Well, I suspect the whole exercise of bumping up the x-height a bit doesn't
    have so much to do with making it look the same x-height as the regular. In my
    limited experience I found you just don't have much much room to maneuver in the
    between the x-height and base line--particularly on the double stories a, e, s,
    g--and pushing up the x-height a bit helps you to distort the shapes of the regular
    a bit less. \r\n\r\nSince we don't normally mix bold and regular side-by-side,
    I'm guessing that Slimbach preferred to keep the same vertical metrics on the
    ascender and cap height, so the white space between lines wouldn't be crowded.\r\n\r\nedit:

    in apparent size would be much more jarring than a mathematical, barely perceptible
    shift of the x-line (since we're talking about a range of maybe 5\u201310 units)?
    FWIW, it was actually on jobs like that that I was taught to increase the point
    size on the Bold if it \"looks\" too small.\r\n\r\nAlso, one would hope that graphic
    designers who use text fonts for logos should be aware that some things may look
    funky up close\u2026 maybe too idealistic.\r\n\r\nAlso, what about shifting the

  body: ">side by side\r\n\r\nI meant we normally don't have a bold and regular adjacent
    to one another in the same word, as in your examples above. They are separated
    by a word space. I think that is also the concern Mark mentioned, that in a logo
    the could well be adjacent, and hence your concerns would be relevant. However,
    in the case of a logo, things can be custom shifted or redrawn.  \r\n\r\nIn the
    normal case, to do the comparison, you need to have eg a side head in bold, and
    the sentence continuing in regular. In the case of Adobe Garamond, the 'bold'
    relative to the regular is actually the semi-bold, so for a bold in the middle
    of the sentence that would be the comparison. \r\n\r\nI suspect that there you
    will find that baseline shifting of rounds may create more problems than it will
    solve. I haven't tried it, and it would be interesting to see--but in any case
    I think that's the more important comparison, not adjacent glyphs of different
    weights.  "

  body: "1. As far as I know, there is no statistical survey.\r\nI've done it on a
    few faces.\r\nOne reason is that when I did a lot of editorial design, I often
    increased the size of bold subheadings because I felt it looked too small next
    to the Regular. So that feature of my type design is based on my own taste as
    a typographer, which I've subsequently rationalized.\r\n\r\nI would say that apparent
    size is dependent on more than one indicator or cue:\r\n\r\n- Distance between
    extrema of letter outline\r\n- Distance between optical centre of horizontal strokes\r\n-
    Distance between extrema of negative counter\r\n\r\nThe gestalt of height is a
    synthesis of these height assessments.\r\n\r\n2. Compare the density (overall
    tone) of the x-height zone with that of the median-to-cap zone. If the x-height
    is constant from Regular to Bold, then the density of the x-height zone will increase
    with font weight (in all but the didone genre), giving a relatively bottom-heavy
    appearance. Raising the x-height counteracts this. But raising the cap or ascender
    line as well would not.\r\n\r\n3. Because letters stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I'm thinking primarily of side-heads in Bold, with Regular on the same line, or

    In these situations, the reader's expectation is that the letters stand on the
