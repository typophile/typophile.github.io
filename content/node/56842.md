body: "Okay so I am starting my stationary/wedding invite company that specializes
  in letterpress and silkscreen as well as pen and ink illustration.\r\n\r\nThe name
  is Anavi Ink. I have a logo that I like which combines the i from Anavi and the
  i from ink so there is just one i with an ink splotch for the dot on the i.\r\n\r\nHowever
  people have been reading it as Anav Ink which I don't want since that is NOT my
  last name.\r\n\r\nI need suggestions for how I can do the same basic idea, but with
  people somehow reading the name with two (ii)s.\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: It's hard to give feedback without seeing an image but it sounds like the
    ii confusion is going to be unavoidable in the format you have in mind. The problem
    is that Anavi is an unfamiliar name so readers are going to have a hard time separating
    AVANINK the two words. You could try using a color build on the I to demonstrate
    the combination eg. AVAN in cyan, NK in magenta, and I in an overprinted cyan/magenta.
    Otherwise, I think it's time to start sketching two word solutions.

    letter?

    to that thread: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/56865\r\n\r\nAnd by the
    way: the photo I posted is the correct way to spell \"stationery\" if you mean
    writing paper and envelopes. The way you're spelling it in both your posts, \"stationary,\"
    means that something doesn't move. So I say again, be sure to use the correct
    spelling, or people will stay away from your store.\r\n"
