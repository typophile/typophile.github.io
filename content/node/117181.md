  newbie, but know how to install! ;))\r\n\r\nWe're not concerned w/ the shading/sketching
  pattern but what the letters look like.  We want to paint it on a sign and the letters
  will just be a solid color."

  body: "Another good find Fivos. I have seen an old type-face circa 1900 that may
    have been the model for Tom Kolter's Return to Sender, but I can't recall the
    specifics. The sign should have a nice vintage style.\r\nDon"

  body: "Yes Mike, that's the name I was trying to recall. The letters are almost
    identical. If I wanted clean outlines to paint a sign I would use McCollough.
    If I wanted a rough look I would use Return to Sender.\r\nDon"

  body: "Matamoros NF is based on a similar but different font -- note for example
    the lazy s counters in _O_ and _Q_, similar to Inland Foundry's _Inland_ -- from
    circa 1900 called Jason Wood by Dan X. Solo and sold by him in digital form with
    one of the Dover Books. Used for the title of the Solotype catalog.\r\nI don't
    know the designer, original name or foundry.\r\nDon"
