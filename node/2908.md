  body: From the sublime to the ridiculous, we can go from Mark&#39;s Mostra to <a
    href="http://simplythebest.net/fonts/fonts/pacmania.html" target="_blank">Pacmania</a>
    and perhaps find something with closer letterforms, but this sort of geometric
    work with landscape doesn&#39;t need a font &#40;obviously&#41;.

    source for a digital version though.

  body: Only an American could relate fascist lettering to the Pac-man logo or Milton
    Glaser&#39;s Baby Teeth. I&#39;ve already told Mark his Mostra is very nice, but
    you have to be grown up in Italy to &#42;feel&#42; what the fascist aesthetic
    was about. The reworking of roman aesthetic was the basis of all this. <BR>For
    the same reason P22&#39;s Il Futurismo sucks big time.

  body: BTW, the best example of typeface drawn after Pac-Man&#39;s logo is Ray Larabie&#39;s
    Crackman. Very good.

  body: Claudio,  <BR> <BR>Maybe we missed the poster&#39;s point, but politics aside,
    our job here is usually to try to help someone find a font that is &#40;or resembles&#41;
    their sample. It&#39;s fine for you to say it&#39;s Fascist, but they are still
    letterforms, and as stupid as it sounds the Pacman/Baby Teeth fonts use some very
    similar shapes.  Larabie&#39;s imitation is a better Pac-Man simulation, but the
    shading was not present in the tree shapes, so I picked a Pac-Man font that was
    just geometric shapes. It&#39;s an exercise for fun, not a reason for polemics.

    and like magic your post is posted. Works every time.
