  posted this the other day: \r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/45780 and have made some
  changes and added some other ideas, I would be very grateful to see what anyone
  thinks. I really like the idea of just having a 'R' and degree symbol, but havn't
  really been able to make it work yet.\r\nAny feedback would be very much appreciated,

    only worry is that the partially rounded trend might date this design as time
    goes on, but on the other hand, maybe it will becme more popular before it subsides:\r\n\r\n/me
    recalls the stupid 'techno' and 'matrix' styled designs from a few years ago with
    cut-off corners and concentric circles\r\n\r\nBottom Middle:\r\n\r\nSimple, clean,
    effective.  It feels a touch empty or weak, but maybe it just needs more time
    to grow on me.  I think this i the best or has the most potential of all of them!\r\n\r\nHope
    that helped!"

    wordmark, so I think keeping the logo simple would be good.\r\n\r\nThe cityscape
    in #7 won't read well at small sizes.\r\n\r\nWhat about making a keyhole that
    is also a thermometer to indicate \"red hot?\" Hmmm or maybe not, it's been a
    long day at work, so I can't tell how bad my ideas are at this point haha.\r\n\r\nI
    do, however, really like the idea of the keyhole representing the \"R\" but I
    agree with Scott Leyes that they are a little past their hey-day."

    HOT. I'd even them out. The first and last R\xB0 may be placed in the middle of
    their frames, but optically, I think they could be nudged towards the top. The
    space between the cap height and frame edge look a little big to me. You could
    try tweaking the type logo yourself (removing some of the curved ends while keeping
    others?) to fit your needs..."

    played a little bit with the overlay here, I think you have a great thing going
    on, but for the overall shape of the mark, I'd seriously consider borrowing centuries
    of aesthetic development and make the overall shape of the thing more like the
    inverted profile of a princess cut diamond. It's sure to work well ad take the
    guesswork out out of the sizes.\r\n\r\nhere's your logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cut_3813.png]\r\n\r\nHere's

  body: I think the word PROPERTY is crowding RED HOT. The word spacing in RED HOT
    is greater than the line spacing between the two lines. They need to at least
    be equal or a bit more.

    the spacing is out and in no way has the quality of your efforts!). I quickly
    dropped in a Diavlo R and flipped the shape so that the curves followed the shape

  body: "A few points and suggestions:\r\n\r\n1) I'm not inherently against using
    an initial as the basis of a mark, but in your current configuration, I don't
    think the logo is functioning well for these reasons:\r\n\r\nBecause both the
    R in the title and the R in the mark use the same typeface, the mark becomes superfluous.
    It seems like overkill - like I'm seeing the logo twice, especially because there's
    not really any separation or differentiation between the mark and the title. I
    would suggest using a different typeface for one of the components, or just integrating
    your idea into the title, as shown below. If you went that route, you could use
    the standalone R as an alternate logo.\r\n\r\n2) It is possible people won't get
    the thermometer symbolism, so why not embrace your idea more literally? Perhaps
    stylize the R more like a thermometer, or scrap the R all together, and create
    some type of real estate/thermometer symbol, something like what I've shown below.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rh_01_4954.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/rh_02_5361.jpg]"
