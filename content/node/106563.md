  for an editor, where you write/edit with your \"normal\" TTF-beziers in order to
  generate a bitmap-image with your embedded bitmaps.\r\n\r\nI have first made the
  strike and generated the .bdf in FontForge, then imported the bitmaps in Fontlab,
  copied them to background and then traced the pixels. Thus, the outlines are are
  just vectorized copies of the embedded bitmaps. I have set the spacing on each side
  of the glyph to one pixel:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/m_6658.jpg]\r\n\r\nHowever,
  when I test the font in Photoshop and in the editor, I get that the spacing behaves
  differently every time I type in the same word (the example shown is in a 96 dpi
  file, and the irregular spacing happens regardless if set the type in 14,25 pt or
  round it down to 14 pt). See attachment\r\n\r\nNow my question is; what is causing
  this irregular spacing of the bitmaps, and how can it be corrected? Is the problem
  within the font or within a setting in the applications?\r\n\r\nI am looking very
  much forward to getting your feedback. It will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nElias\r\n"

    widths and optical kerning is turned off.

  body: "I was not aware Photoshop used the embedded bitmaps. (Does it use them under
    all sharpness modes, as well?) Yes, with fractional widths and optical kerning,
    you are likely to get these rounding errors. I don\u2019t know if Adobe Photoshop
    listens to x-direction TrueType hints either, but those could potentially provide
    better control in situations like these. \r\n\r\n"

    so must ClearType, in case you have a PC."
