  body: Well, it would depend on the font, wouldn't it. In general, a capital E is
    a touch wider than an F (about 1.045 times wider in Helvetica, for example), and
    almost always the right sidebearing is greater. Often the left sidebearing is
    the same. But at some point, you'll have to dial it in for your font.
