  body: "If you buy the Dolly Booklet you get a cd with the font to try it (like you
    try a car before you buy it).\r\nIf you like the font you have to buy a license.
    Perhapse they can e-mail you the font if you ask them.\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: I e-mailed them yesterday and left a message on their Dutch-speaking answering
    machine this moring. Hopefully they'll get back to me. A few type foundries have
    let us try out fonts; it's extremely helpful in getting a feel of a typeface's
    personality.

    for it. Not only great designers, nice people too.

  body: Underware are very nice guys and I'm sure they will provide you with a "try-out"
    version?! And the Dolly booklet is an excellent show off of the family.

  body: "Good news; they'll allow a trial run.\r\n\r\nAny of you using Dolly? My editor
    argues that it was designed primarily for books and long passages of text, but
    the examples of Dolly in use on Underware's site look fantastic. I've noticed
    several die-hard Dolly fans on this site as well. It definitely has a contemporary
    look that I'm going for in the magazine's redesign.\r\n\r\n"
