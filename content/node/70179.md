body: "Hi everybody,\r\nI'm a student of master in graphic design and I'm building
  a new typeface. It's a remake of a hand lettering. The original draw was made by
  a Oporto's seller.\r\n\r\nHere is http://typophile.com/files/hamburg.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm
  showing here for ask your contribution and opinion. I have many doubts about how
  I can adapt the original design for new caracters. Can anyone help me?\r\nPlease,
  say what do you think about. Sugestions and critics are welcome.\r\nThanks."

  body: The new version seems too formulaic. It's lost the personality of the original.
    Take some of the quirky details in the original and find places for them to be
    interjected into the newer version.
