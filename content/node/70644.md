    could be used to make a reasonable copy if you don't have the budget.\r\n\r\n

  body: "\"Tyrannosaurus Lex\" - I never even thought of that, but it's great!\r\n\r\nIt's
    all part of my rebranding - I figured the media production side of my company
    should be separate from the web design and graphic design side. The new site will
    be up soon at http://thedinosaur.ca and then http://apartment32.com will be devoted
    to the video/audio stuff.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
