Quite....hmm... generic. As generic as the business&#40;es&#41; the company has. Will be applied mostly on stationery and printed matter, as well as web &#40;naturally&#41;. That&#39;s it. Nothing really &#34;extraordinaire&#34;. <BR>Anyway. Here is the logo: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10647.gif" alt="image"> <BR> <BR>WITAL wording was done earlier. Initially it was meant for being in the upper part alone, as the lower part was meant for the sub-companys &#40;Like, WITAL Air Cargo, for examply, or... WITAL Development, etc&#41;. Now that the company merged with another company, the SPRIT wording should go into the upper part. This is exactly where my problems lies. <BR>What d&#39;you think?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would say Franklin Gothic. But, I would use a smaller point size and a thinner weight. Uppercase appears also to work best in this instance. For whatever reason, Helvetica appars stuffy and not comfortable with the pairing here. I also agree with Stephen about the thins on your bodoni. Can the client afford two weights? I would recommend ITC Bodoni 72 for larger versions and the 12 for smaller. <BR> <BR>Bodoni is narrow, here, and the helvetica seems wide. The franklin gothic is of the same width, relatively, with the bodoni. And with the exactness in the bodoni&#39;s construction, I would also say that Franklin is more exact, ergo geometric, than is helvetica. It seems the word &#39;sprit&#39; either needs to line up with then end of the &#39;L&#39; or not. I&#39;m thinking that perfect alignment might be nicer. <BR> <BR>Also, if you could use a bodoni with a bit thicker thins there could be more evenness in color. As it is you have three different weights of stroke, the letters have nothing in common. <BR> <BR>I will say that I really like severity and simplicity of it. And I for one miss the use of the color red. I miss franklin and bodoni as well. I&#39;d say that your client should regret adding &#39;sprit&#39; if anything that is the problem here not type selection. <BR> <BR>Very nice. Stick around. The more the merrier.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bodoni is not a good coice for a Logo that could -- e.g. if your company acts as a sponsor for something -- always end up being printed rather small. If you keep the Bodoni, you should manually work a bit on the hairlines to make the stand out more, maybe come up with different versions of the logo for different sizes of usage, as Stephen suggested. <BR>Also, Helvetica and Bodoni, although the pair looks good here, is a bad mix, as both types share the same classical background, both having rather static forms. If you WANT that, great... but if not you could try a sans-serif-typeface that has a constructed character, such as Futura or Century or Neutraface, which has wonderful upper case letters :-D. The constructed geometric should make a nice contrast to the static, but still not fully non-human look of the bodoni. An american-goth type like Franklin or, even worse, a sans-serif based on humanistic renaissance principles &#40;such as Frutiger, Gill et all&#41;, is out of the question... the dynamic style would not contrast the stiff but lively Bodoni at all.  <BR> <BR>What is very nice about mixing Bodoni and Helvetica is the ironic mix of a&#41; two over-used types and b&#41; the clash of a very emotional and a very technical/practical typeface.  <BR> <BR>Other than that it&#39;s classical, simple, the double rectangle motif is something you can play with on brilliantly later-on... it also has a touch of humour. I like it. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">what a hot discussion.... <BR>Paul, thank you for the rescaling bug you noticed. I&#39;m also building the site for them, so I&#39;ve just corrected the width value. I&#39;d never noticed that. ! <BR> <BR>As for Bodoni being a parody - unfortunately I cannot add anything to that, either positive or negative. I cannot say I hate Bodoni, but the more I work with it, the more I like it. hmm.. <BR>&#34;Hairlines in small sizes&#34; problem is not really a problem. The only imaginable application for the logo in small sizes is a business card. It won&#39;t go smaller than that. It works okay there. <BR>Bodoni&amp;Futura was shouted out several times. I am sorry, but it just doesn&#39;t work for me with these words. Looks horrible. As well as Avenir. Frutiger wasn&#39;t even tried out. I dunno...</div>
