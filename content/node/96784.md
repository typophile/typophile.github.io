    That's a composition I created here on Sunday in my studio. Photographed with
    my point and shoot. I think I'm getting better at using my camera set on Manual.
    But, hopefully I'll be picking up a T4i soon enough although I haven't fully committed
    to Canon or a Nikon. Either way I'm more than ready to graduate to a dslr with
    greater capabilities. \r\n\r\n2. Just sharing my comp.  I think it's typography
    and then some.\r\n\r\nI like those ready made letter shapes. I'll be using them
    again soon in some signage :)\r\n\r\n Hopefully other people will post their creative

    of me purchasing those alphabets as a lot like purchasing a font license. \r\n\r\nAnd
    no, I didn't just throw them down to create that composition. I composed them
    in the same manner as you would with any other type. To me, the piece is of a
    broader definition of typography...\r\n\r\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/typography?s=t\r\n\r\n...typographic

    would be looking at something like \xA35 for one set and that is if you could
    find them. Maybe I am just not looking hard enough or in the right places.\r\n\r\nI

    course I said yes and asked for him to send over a photo of the piece ...and he
    did!! along with the request of me sending over to him and his crew anything I
    thought he would enjoy.  So ever since then (this all happened a couple of years
    ago) I've been bombin' his personal email with most everything I've been doing!!
    He actually takes the time to respond to my work. Not all of it, but most all
    of it. Very cool stuff indeed.\r\n\r\nSo I sent over the image frontin' this thread
    ... and he absolutely loved it!!!  Here is what he sent me today...\r\n\r\n\"And
    by the way that pic you sent me with the mic hanging over all the letters is super
    cool i posted it on instagram everyone's loving it, even my rapper friends that
    arn't so \"artsey\" think its sick!! lol It is now my official background for

    for the thought hrant.\r\nHe's edgy. Raw edgy in a urban Us vs Them sort of way
    but for the most part his lyrics aren't anything too 'damaging' for me to be associated
    with. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>So who's the mystery rapper? Kevin Federline?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHe's
    black loud and proud ...sorry that's not much to go on but I'm not going to pimp
    his rep. \r\n\r\nMy only true concern is the quality of my work ...especially
    if I've had to think over it for awhile.  I want to get better with every piece
    I do.  And I've come to realize that thinking and rethinking dummies down the
    energy of a piece of work. But there are times, and they're coming more often
    than not these days, when I seem to be able to nail a subject. And that gives
    me hope for survival. \r\n\r\nIf people dig what I do ...then that's awesome!!!
    but that's not going improve my work. I guess, in a way, I'm seeking some sort
    of truth in my own ability using type/typography as a means of expression.\r\n\r\nSorry

        may have something to do with the trend favoring \"the 80s,\" which is cycling
        into \"the 90s.\" My older kids are now memorizing Ice Ice Baby and insisting
        that it's the coolest thing ever, for instance. But I like your explanation

  body: I know that there is a growing trend towards the appreciation of things authentic
    and and-made as opposed to mechanical. For example, calligraphy and hand drawn
    scripts are becoming popular, eating local, hipster-farmers &c. This hand-writing
    thing is another manifestation of it, and the 3D scribbler aesthetic is simply
    a clever bit of retro-vernacular. How an 11 year old beat them to the punch by
    six years is blowing my mind!

      years, if not now, you could dress up like a hipster c 2005-10. Poor hipsters.

      the afore hand drawn 3D letters, I seem to be seeing them in a lot of newer
      movie credits as of late. Pseudo-indi comedies. Can\u2019t name specifics atm.
      Nothing against the letters personally, I actually did a lot of that in jr.
