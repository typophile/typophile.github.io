  Lohse, Neuburg and Vivarelli founded journal &#40;1958-1965, 18 issues&#41;. Does
  anyone have any suggestions on where I should begin my search?

  body: In University libraries, particularly art schools. <BR> <BR>Since you are
    in Vancouver, you could check out Emily Carr. I don&#39;t know what other art
    schools are in the Pacific Northwest. There must be copies in California somewhere.
    <BR> <BR>When I was at RISD, there was an excellent inter-library loan programin
    place throughout all of New England&#39;s colleges. That was great. Except for
    the Harvard books. You had to go to Cambridge and look at them there. Plus, you
    had to schedule an &#34;appointment&#34; to even get into the library. Well, almost
    all of the other libraries were nicer.
