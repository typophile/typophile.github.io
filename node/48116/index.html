  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have just taken over a weekly newpaper and am in the process of creating new text styles for various elements (body copy, cutline, etc.). The problem I&rsquo;m having is with justification.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/justify-1_3817.jpg]</p>
<p>I have played around with the various settings but can not get the spacing how I want it. In the image I&rsquo;ve included, for example, the word &ldquo;Regional&rdquo; should not be breaking like it is. Also, in the next paragraph, the spaces on either side of the word &ldquo;vendor&rdquo; are just to big.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s probably a quick and simple fix, but I haven&rsquo;t played about with his stuff as much because this is my first time creating my own styles.</p>
<p>Any tips would be appreciated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>you have a very narrow column <strong>and</strong> a justified setting –  <strong>and</strong> you want good spacing.
I’m afraid to say that you can’t have all three at the same time.

		<div class="commentbody">For a weekly newspaper you can use some justification settings that will reduce the big white gaps &ndash; but like Florian says, there are tradeoffs. 
First of all, for your body styles, you should set the hyphenation panel to match your preferences: for example, it sounds like you would like minimum number of characters after the hyphen to be 3. 
For a narrow justified column (like a newspaper), you can try using a small amount of letterspacing or glyphscaling in the justification panel.  I know this is a religious issue, but I will just mention it. Using letterspacing of -2% - +2% or glyphscaling of 98%-102% can help with spacing and is barely noticeable.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>With this kind of work, I suspect you will get better results using the single line composer rather than the paragraph composer. Certainly you will have more control if you choose to modify things by hand. Others may disagree, but when I set ragged right, for example, I tend to use the single line composer. The paragraph composer&rsquo;s decisions try to even things, but the compromises it makes are not to my taste.</p>
<p>For example: in setting a justified paragraph, I often prefer one really terrible line &amp; the rest good over all lines being fairly bad, but not as the one terrible line. You may decide otherwise.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Charles. You&rsquo;ll have better luck getting the results you probably expect using the Single Line Composer. That &ldquo;Regional&rdquo; for instance &ndash; Eric, I don&rsquo;t think DBell wants to exclude 2-letter endings; but one would expect that Regional would not break, because there&rsquo;s plenty of room left on the first line.</p>
<p>The issue here is that the Paragraph Composer is calculating all the following lines and judging that in order to keep others downstream from being less desirable, the first line needs to sacrifice that &ldquo;-al&rdquo;. But this is contrary to what the typical designer would want/expect. Switching to Single Line Composer should help with this. And, as Charles said, it will make manual adjustments more manageable.</p>
<p>In addition, as Eric suggested, you may wish to add some letterspacing (or even glyph scaling). Yes, this is heretical, I realize. But newspaper setting is a unique and extreme situation, and will sometimes admit of extreme measures.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d do -2% letterspacing; looks like your body type is already spaced snuggly, and you wouldn&rsquo;t want your words crushing up. Your Min word space is already handling tight lines fine. Maybe -1% but only as a last resort. Adding +2%, however will ameliorate those inevitable gappy lines, like that &ldquo;vendors&rdquo; line, a little. (But more than 2% could lead to the kind of really open spacing that Goudy railed against.)</p>
<p>I personally would probably try to resist glyph scaling. But you could experiment with including 1 or 2%, as Eric suggests. My test, in these cases, is to see if I can actually spot the difference in practice. If I can&rsquo;t, then I know that no one else will.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For letterspacing, I routinely use</p>
<p>-0.1%,   0%,    0.1%</p>
<p>and for glyph scaling,</p>
<p>99.5%,    100%,   100.5%</p>
<p>in the Minimum, Desired, Maximum columns in Justification. IDCS2 takes the values, but I can&rsquo;t really see whether or not it honors them (and that&rsquo;s the point, isn&rsquo;t it).</p>
