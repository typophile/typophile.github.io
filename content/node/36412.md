  body: "<em>But next time use your blog to share the link. :^)</em>\r\n\r\nHey, Tiffany,
    I have a question about that -- I noticed Zara making a similar comment on another
    thread. Are there new guidelines about what kind of links NOT to post in the forums?
    Or are y'all just encouraging us to use our generous blog bandwith?  :-)  Inquiring
    Typophile minds want to know!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yeah it is more just to use your blog. No new guidelines. Let's use our blogs!!
    (I'm not really one to talk as I haven't blogged in ages.)

  body: "Back when the number of views were listed with a post, I noticed that many
    more people seemed to see something if it was in discussions. Things tend to get
    lost in the blog section since it isn't listed as with the forums, which is what
    I have linked in my toolbar.\r\n\r\nAs an aside: <strong>Pretty, pretty please</strong>,
    can we revert to edits that stay in order?"

    homepage, which is good enough for me. Many users still go there, I suppose, especially
    if they have the latest operating systems and Web 2.0-friendly browsers (like
    Ill Sans, I am not one of those at the moment!)."

  body: "I guess I would like some clarification on what the admins want in a blog
    and not in the forums. Blogs are never looked at. A solution might be to add a
    directory called \"Blogs\" along with the General, Design, Build, etc. It would
    have a current post listing like the rest and perhaps not be overlooked?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    found, whether or not it might ellicit discussion, post it on your blog. If you
    have a question for the group post it in the GENERAL area."

    is how I follow Typophile. It is CMD-1 when I wake up in the morning."
