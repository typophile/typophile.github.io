  recommend some iPod/iPhone apps that might be handy for drawing glyphs?"

  body: "Typism doesn't seem to suit the very small screen . . . unless I'm doing
    something wrong. I tried it in Safari and Opera . . . has anyone has success working
    with it on an iPod/iPhone?\r\n\r\nAdobe Ideas looks fun for only for Americans:
    it's not available in the Japanese iTunes store. Damn.\r\n\r\nThe Palm was better
    suited for bitmap drawing because on the pen. I've tried Autodesk Sketchbook and
    Edge Touch but it's frustrating without a pen to get pixel precision. Although,
    I could get used to Edge Touch for really lo-res pixel fonts. http://iphone.takabosoft.com/en/edgetouch/index.htm\r\n\r\nI
    can sort of draw letters with the Buro Destruct app. (Check the T in the Typophile
    10th Birthday thread) http://www.burodestruct.net/bdd/\r\n\r\nAre there any apps
    with Bezier curve editing?\r\n\r\nSomewhat related: has everyone tried the Typography
    Junkies app?\r\n"

  body: "Ah, right. For some reason I was thinking you were asking about iPad apps.
    Not in Japan just yet.\r\n\r\nAs for the pen, there is a thing called a Pogo Stylus
    that works with touch-based screens and pads:\r\n\r\nhttp://tenonedesign.com/stylus.php\r\n\r\nI
    tried to get one at my local Apple store, but they were out. Seems like it would
    be great for drawing apps."
