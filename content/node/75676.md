  of weeks now and have had no luck at all. I might have to start looking at editing
  a font after I have converted it to outlines.\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample of eurostile
  which I like to get some comments on: Is the Characters, kerning etc all in order?\r\n\r\nAnd
  the second sample is me squashing forza which I like (will need adjustment if I
  was to buy it).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FOURMATION2_6060.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fourmation_4149.jpg]"
