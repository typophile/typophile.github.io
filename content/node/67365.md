  body: "The script reminds me of [[http://www.type-o-tones.com/fonts.php?id=36|Memimas]]
    from Type-O-Tones, but it's not the same. I searched all of MyFonts and Veer for
    informal scripts and couldn't find it either.\r\n\r\nHow do they make fonts look
    like letterpress? Are they making plates from the fonts?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I'm assuming this is letterpress printed from photopolymer plates (which can
    be made from digital data).
