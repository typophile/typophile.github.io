body: "I\u2019ve been working on my own portfolio and I\u2019ve been eyeing for Sauna
  italic from Underware to use as heading or captions in my portfolio. As you know,
  Sauna only comes in package not in single weight. Although, I love the whole package,
  I can\u2019t afford to buy them. Since I am currently a student. So far, I\u2019ve
  been using Palatino for the body copy. I hope somebody could give me suggestion
  a similar typeface like Sauna italic in regular weight for heading.\r\n\r\nI like
  Klavika italic from Process Type Foundry too, but I founded they are too geometric
  and bit cold. It is not suitable to pair it with my work, because I wanted the overall
  look of my portfolio as warmth and elegant but also contemporary.\r\n\r\n(Palatino
  as body copy is not final and I also prefer the normal Sauna italic to swash version)\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n"

  body: Thanks. I had it at my fingertips because I had, myself, considered it as
    an alternative to Sauna, which I bought just last week.

    only one weight of Sauna? From what I've heard, most type designers and foundries
    are quite understanding of situations like yours.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Well, I haven't tried to contact them yet but I read from previous post before
    that someone was looking to buy single cuts of Sauna. It looks likely that he
    got no luck since Village confirmed that Underware have chosen to license for
    their full families, except Bello. Even though Village have asked several times
    to Underware if they consider selling single weights of their fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo
    far, Oz intrigues me the most. But I am still not sure to go with it. It still
    not there yet. Oz has the similar rounded feel like Sauna but it lack of the geometric
    side, very feminine. I guess I am being too picky, it is impossible to found the
    exactly the same one. \r\n\r\nI might give it a try to contact Underware tell
    them how desperately I need the font.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the suggestion\u2026
    but I am still optimistic to find something similar.  There must be something
    more similar out there\u2026\r\n\r\n- Dian\r\n"

    understanding; you might be able to get a discount on condition that you use their
    fonts for educational purposes only (I'm not sure if a student's portfolio would
    fit in this category).
