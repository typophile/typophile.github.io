  body: "As the author of the node I believe they have the ability to correct the
    subject after the fact... (Click on the 'edit' button when viewing the thread)\r\n\r\nBecause
    of this we should ask those who forget to use a descriptive subject to change
    it so their post is open to search in the future. I say this because many of the
    requesters post once and are never heard from again.\r\n\r\n@ ginagrandiosa: Can
    you adjust the subject on this post to be more descriptive?  Something like 'Rooftop
    Cinema Slab Serif ID request' Thanks!"
