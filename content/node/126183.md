  body: That's not Serif for sure. I looked at https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/classification/serif/
    and there's nothing like this there. I hear that http://uk.essaydune.com/ has
    got a paid font generator for students college papers, but haven't tried yet.
    Seems you need to register to download it.
