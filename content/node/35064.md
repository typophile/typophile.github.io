  US National Park signs...kind of \"carved\" but legible. Perhaps something with
  an American Indian look would be an alternative.\r\n\r\nYour expert suggestions
  are appreciated as always...thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nDavid"

    target=\"_blank\">like this?</a> That sign was probably routed by hand, possibly
    using a letter template (i.e. there's probably not a digital version, unless somebody
    made a font based on the sign).\r\n\r\nYou might want to check out <a href=\"http://typography.com/catalog/gothamrounded/index.html\"

    it yourself.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    like that, but digital, without the need to distress it...it's for a short-deadline
    project (not that anyone else has experienced that...)\r\n\r\nAny further suggestions
    would be welcomed...\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n"
