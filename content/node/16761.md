body: 'Like some other recent critique posts, this font was created for Amy Conger''s
  class at City College of San Francisco. It lacks any adjustment to the vertical
  and horizontal strokes to make the weights appear balanced. It is not kerned, and
  the widths of the letters are not adjusted systematically. The font is not adjusted
  for ink trapping, so on most output devices the a, b, d, g look thick. '

  body: "On first glance, many of the curves look bumpy and the stroke weights are
    inconsistent.  Look at the m and n for example.\r\nClean curves are very important
    in particular for a geometric sans like yours.  Take some time and learn to make
    clean curves keeping BCPs perpendicular and their handles of even length. Then
    come back to your glyphs and give them a new workout.  Type is about rhythm.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    body: 'Thanks for the input. I think I need to learn how to keep track of where
      the BCPs are and why. Probably, the trick is to make sure that curves vary in
      consistant ways throughout the font. '

  body: "You can use universal guides to mark BCP points or just copy and paste curve
    segments from one glyph to the next.  You can also mirror and rotate quadrants
    of a curved glyph to get the remaining part of it.\r\n\r\n ChrisL"
