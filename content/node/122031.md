  for web use. We'll be using this one in the body copy throughout the site. The client
  is a university, in case that adds any desired context.\r\n\r\nGalaxie Copernicus
  is presently on the table, but I'm not sure of what else. Any suggestions? Thank
  you."

  body: "Certainly Galaxie Copernicus could work. It seems though that the \"issue\"
    is that too many typefaces could pair up with Galaxie Polaris. I worked for a
    company before that once paired Frutiger Light for the body text with Trinit\xE9
    for headings. I haven't seen what they did with these typefaces myself, but to
    my mind they were probably a very good pair, even though at first glance it seems
    an unlikely choice as they have nothing at all in common, except perhaps for their
    quality. I can imagine if you use a light weight of Galaxie Polaris it could pair
    up with a lot of bold serif typefaces.\r\n\r\nI suppose in order to make proper
    suggestions we ought to know more about the project. What do you want to convey?
    I can imagine something that contrasts well with Galaxie Polaris could work well.
    Something like Alegreya perhaps. However, that may just be too calligraphic. Skolar
    may be an excellent choice. Also because it was designed for academic publications.
    But maybe you require something more elegant?\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at web fonts
    though, but perhaps these suggestions could send you in the right direction to
    find a suitable typeface yourself."

  body: "Martin:\r\n\r\nThank you for your thoughtful reply.\r\n\r\nThe client is
    a top tier business school and Polaris is the identity typeface. If you were to
    look at our collateral, you may find much of it leans conservative, but by and
    large, we have the necessary scaffolding to select a typeface that doesn't fall
    in the realm of \"business conservative.\"\r\n\r\nCopernicus remains on the table
    because it is Polaris's sister, but also, because the typeface is presently being
    used in one of our running print publications. The actual \"official\" secondary
    font is Hoefler, but it has fallen into disuse and many of us find it drab. A
    serif such as Hoefler does not convey the visual style of where the school is
    now, in 2014/15.\r\n\r\nSo with that said, perhaps another way to look at this
    is: what are similar typefaces to Copernicus, that pair well with Polaris, and
    are friendly yet not overly experimental or expressive? I believe your Skolar
    suggestion is right on the mark, while Alegreya (though I love it so) is too calligraphic. "

    added a few more classical typefaces, but I get the feeling you may be looking

    Skolar and Galaxie Copernicus."
