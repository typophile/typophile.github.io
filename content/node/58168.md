  I'm looking to get my hands on a sans italic, which slants to 20\xBA (it can be
  a bit more, or a bit less, but roughly 20\xBA).\r\n\r\nAnybody know some good ones?\r\n\r\nThanks
  as always!"

    slanted italics, I noticed [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-legacy-sans/|Legacy
    Sans]]. It's also an actual italic face, not just obliqued. Not sure if that's
    20 degrees though.\r\n\r\nOf course the simplest thing would be to oblique any
    sans face you have, since that passes for 'italics' for many sans faces anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks Mike!\r\n\r\nYeah, Legacy Sans was one of my finalists. What I'm thinking
    of doing is SLIGHTLY slanting an italic that works well with the logo, so it's
    more in tune with it.\r\n\r\nUnless I get flamed for committing type murder\u2026"
