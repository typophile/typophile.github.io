  the wrong section. \r\n\r\nI am looking for advice for a font for a prayer book
  I am compiling, preferably for free if I do not yet have it (I am a poor college
  student). Here is what I am looking for:\r\n\r\na serif font\r\nformal\r\nbeautiful,
  but not overbearingly so. \r\nHas the versicle and response (looks like a V with
  a line through its right leg and an R with a line through its right leg, respectively)\r\nuses
  old-style numerals\r\nextensive coverage of ligatures\r\nOld-Style or Transitional
  (not Modern unless it is really good)\r\nthat is not Times New Roman or Georgia\r\nthe
  acute accent has at least a 30 degree angle (similar to Palatino) in relation to
  the top of the vowel (unlike Courier, which is more         \r\n                                    of
  a 20 degree)\r\nprints well\r\n\r\nI have seriously looked at, so far: Century,
  Palemonas MUFI, Old Standard, Palatino, Caslon Roman\r\n\r\nHere are my problems
  with each of them (in reverse order):\r\nCaslon Roman is too spiny. I like Caslon,
  but I have not found a Caslon-based font besides Caslon Roman that is free.\r\n\r\nPalatino
  does not have the character support I need (it lacks the response and versicle)\r\n\r\nOld
  Standard, while having a beautiful appearance, is tiring to read after a while.\r\n\r\nPalemonas
  MUFI - this font is nearly perfect EXCEPT for the fact that its spacing is odd,
  creating too much white space that, while more legible, uses more space and the
  letters themselves are rather small at 12 pt (roughly equivalent to 11pt or 10.5pt
  Times New Roman)\r\n\r\nCentury - also does not have the character support I need
  and, while clear, does not exactly evoke the dignity I would like.\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    book deserve that you spend some money. From a religious point of view, as much
    as from a typographic point of view. \r\n\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a big job for
    a type designer to add a couple of glyphs to a font."

    a far better font for a decent price, I would be able to save up. Thank you.

  body: And why are you asking for "extensive coverage of ligatures"? Are you relying
    on the text serif for display work as well?

  body: "There are two reasons for my wanting the book to have a free or cheap font:
    1) because I do not have the money for a full-fledged Caslon ($135 at one online
    store and it didn't have the versicle) and 2) because I'd like to be able to make
    the prayer book available to my parish with as little cost as possible while making
    it look attractive. At this point in time, I am not planning on making it available
    on the wider market.\r\n\r\nThe prayer book, I hope, should contain numerous prayers
    and devotions from the Roman Catholic faith, mostly in Latin.\r\n\r\nMy problem
    with such fonts like Junicode and Palemonas MUFI are that they tend towards the
    smaller character sizes. \r\n\r\nI would like ligatures (especially \xE6 and \u0153
    with accute accents) because much of the prayer book will be in Latin and I prefer
    the more traditional (medieval) orthography, with j, \xE6 and \u0153. I know the
    current Unicode charts do not have an \u0153 with an accute accent, which was
    why I was looking at Palemonas MUFI, as that character is in its Private Use Area
    coding. I would be willing to save up money for a font if it contained (in addition
    to the basic characters almost every serif font contains) the versicle, response,
    \u0153 with acute, \xE6 with acute and the stylistic categories listed in my first
    post. These are needed because, as a prayer book, it should be dignified in the
    appearance of its text, and, as a prayer book largely in Ecclesiastical Latin
    (which does not distinguish between long and short vowels to the extent of Classical
    Latin), acutes are needed to denote proper pronunciation.\r\n\r\nDoes this help?
    Thank you."

    I suggest  you disregard the character set for now and ask the type designer of
    your chosen face to draw the extra letters. '

  body: "I would consider [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=69|Andron]]
    which has the characteristics you described, but is not free. There is a free
    roman available, but it has a more limited character support. The Latin Corpus
    1 probably covers your needs, with smallcaps, italic and semibold. At \u20AC 169
    it is reasonably priced for such a good typeface. Also there is a lot of support
    if you need extra glyphs made.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/cyclesoverview.html|Cycles]]
    is beatiful. It does not have all the characters you need. Sumner Stone has a
    use-based licensing system, so contact him with your enquiry, and he might be
    able to help for a friendly price. Cycles 11 or 9 are probably the ones of most
    interest.  "

    after a Transitional serif with old style figures, Baskerville 1757 is a very
    good and affordable one - roman and italic in Open Type for 79 euro:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fountain/baskerville_1757_pro/\r\n\r\nAnd
    there's also an historical lineage, since John Baskerville set a \"Book of Common
    Prayer\" in 1771.\r\n\r\nThere could be many other choices, of course, but this
    one could fit you well."
