<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi there! <br> <br>Here is a sample of a serif I'm currently working on. I've never done this before, so I'm anxious to hear your comments. The italics is killing me! <br> <br>Best, <br> <br>H</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Personally I find it a little bit too "classic" for my own tastes, but it certainly looks well-made, at least from that sample. Anyway, if you could provide better sample it would be easier to spot problems. From that sample the only things I myself would suggest are: <br>- The "A" is too tall. <br>- The "G" needs work. <br>- The "Q" needs a much braver tail. <br>- The spacing is nice and tight. <br>- The italics is great [for this genre of face]. <br> <br>BTW, it reminds me a little bit of Vendetta, and Scala Serif too. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Botvide -- Can I ask you to post this sample in a different way? Can you enlarge the separate letters (x2), shrink the sample setting (x2) and change the color to black? Just to "see" things a little more in the black and white. Oh and save it as a .GIF not .JPG <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>I really like the angularity of the italic. <br> <br>Quick thoughts: <br>• The w looks pinched from both sides on the bottom. <br>• The i seems taller than the normal x-height. <br>• The g seems to be falling backward. <br>• The v seems to be leaning forward. <br>• Perhaps the G could become more Elzevirian. <br>• The k seems a bit tall, the x-height portion of it. <br> <br>And, I agree with Hrant's remarks. Accept, of course, the classic remark. I'm all about the classic.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi again! <br> <br>Thanks a lot for your comments. I think I agree with all of them. My problem is that I'm getting stuck. Everything has gone quite smoothly until now, but now suddenly everything I do seem to make things worse. And not being a type professional I think I need to stop and take a deep breath. And sleep. Goddammit, I haven't slept for two days because of this! Is this how you type maniacs lead your life? The last thing you think of before you fall asleep is a possible curve of a lc "c"? <br> <br>Anyhow, here is a pdf, which perhaps makes it easier to look at the font. Please, feel free to send comments - I'm listening. I just need to take a nap first! <br> <br>Best, <br> <br>H</div>

<div class=commentbody>It looks like you're using overlapping letterform parts to make the letters... That makes it hard to appreciate what it will <i>eventually</i> look like. I assume at least some of the irregularity is intentional though, and that I feel is a good thing in this case. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, <br> <br>you're right that I have done some overlapping, but only at certain, for me, especially tricky parts, and only to get "forward", so I can move ahead, see what works, what does not, get the feel of at least some kind of holistic perspective. This is only a first rough draft, nothing more, just as I pointed out in the beginning. At this stage I am more interested in what creates a flow, not the individual letters (which, naturally, is the key anyway - but these I can work on from scratch as soon as I know my direction). It is not as if it is the last check before it goes to the type store. I am not interested in copying someone's work, rest assure. <br> <br>And Hrant, you're also right right about the irregularities. But some seem to disturb, others looks tempting to the eye. I just can't see any system in it. But you have to start somewhere, I guess. <br> <br>Best <br>H</div>
