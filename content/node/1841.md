  of mine just sent me this IP address of a server where one can find just about every
  font there is from all foundries i&#39;ve ever heard from. Quite incredible. Is
  there a way to stop those people? This is serious, and not quite unique; there are
  more places like this. If you want to check it out or do somehting you need to have
  a Carracho client software, and type this IP address. <BR> <BR>IP address: &#40;xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx&#41;

  body: unfortunately there are lots of places to download commercial/licensed fonts.
    if you stop one, 2 others will replace him. also there are various newsgroups
    dealing with fonts. there are even so called &#34;release groups&#34; which &#34;release&#34;
    commercial fonts on a regular basis. they are quite up2date with their releases.  <BR>the
    ip seems to be a non-fixed ip e.g. a dial in account btw... lars

  body: Probably because Anonymous has something to do with the Carracho server. But
    regardless of that, this is a serious stuff, and also wonder what can be done.
    Can an IP address be traced?

  body: Why not just post a link to the Carracho software?  <BR>Not that any of the
    fine upstanding citizens on Typophile would ever download fonts that were illegally
    posted, but the initial post does make it pretty easy for anyone to get in with
    no problem. <BR>  <BR>Even a good kid in an unattended candy store might swipe
    a few if no one was looking. If the kid didn

  body: Eduardo, I just read the first page of the wired article. Basicly do they
    charge you for the download but the people whose intellectual property is being
    downloaded doesn&#39;t neccessarly get any royalities? If so this is so wrong,

  body: Yes IP addresses can be traced. <BR> <BR>Further, if you follow the RIAA &#40;Recording
    Industry Association of America&#41; suits, they&#39;re tracing IP addresses to
    the respective internet service providers &#40;like AT&amp;T or SBC&#41;. The
    ISPs are then subpoenaed to fork over the address/info of the offending end user.  <BR>
    <BR>In the end, Carracho is not much different from Kazaa or Limewire, except
    that Carracho has a central server somewhere and is usually password protected
    &#40;as opposed to the others which are peer to peer networks, without a server
    and without passwords.&#41;

    musians will go find work that can&#39;t be stolden if they aren&#39;t stopped.

    colectors of fonts is terrible. And believe me, there are a lot of them. '

  body: I, however, use Carracho to connect to my home computer from work &#40;only
    because I couldn&#39;t get the FTP thing to work&#41;. So it&#39;s not all illegal
    stuff.
