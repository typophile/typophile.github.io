  body: I think it's custom. It looks like they used different typefaces to make the
    logo. The R looks very strange to me.

  body: The closest R I found was Stone Sans, but the rest of it doesn't match. I
    agree it was probably custom.

  body: You probably won't find a matching font, but you can take a font like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.108066.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=BERTONI&sampleSize=48">Metromedium</a>
    and adjust the R.
