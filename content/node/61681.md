  body: "That w looks like a Caslon italic. See how similar the one from URW's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/caslon-no337/|Caslon
    No. 337]] looks. However, this is not the same as your sample in the other letters,
    so it must be another foundry, or another Caslon.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Awesome, thanks for the comments! You're on the spot with the w and the rest
    looks a lot like Caslon 540, which someone tilted to the right. This should help
    a lot, thanks again!
