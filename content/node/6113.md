  <BR> <BR>I wonder if soemone could elucidate? The consensus seems to be that Glaser
  used American Typewriter Bold - a &#34;no-brainer.&#34; But the version on Milton
  Glaser&#39;s web site: <BR><a href="http://www.miltonglaser.com/projects/logos.html"
  target="_blank">http://www.miltonglaser.com/projects/logos.html</a> <BR>as well
  as every version I have ever seen, is slightly different. ITC American Typewriter
  has a lot more color than Glaser&#39;s version.  <BR> <BR>Any ideas?'

  body: The logo looks more like American Typewriter Medium than bold. But he also
    might have had it re-inked since it&#39;s a logo.
