  some reason, the letter /T renders very thin compared to all my other glyphs as
  if it's been stroked with white. I quadruple-checked the proportions and even redrew
  the glyph in fontlab (i.e. no AI import) but to no avail. I also feel the stems
  of /V are a bit thin too, but not certain.\r\n\r\nIs this a hinting issue? I haven't
  really delved into that yet. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n"

    as if stroked.

  body: Thanks John! It worked. I'm a beginner and didn't even know there was such
    a thing as contour direction. Time to flip through the fontlab manual =)
