body: "I'm happy to see that Spiece Graphics has its typeface Nicolas Jenson SG available.\r\n\r\nIn
  my opinion - and is this perhaps just me, or is there some validity - nearly all
  the \"Jenson\" typefaces seemed to me to be typefaces very distinct from Jenson's
  original typeface; whether those named \"Jenson\", or Centaur, Cloister Old Style,
  Jenson Old Style, and so on. Even though they were all good typefaces, they belonged
  in the larger category of Italian Old Styles - none seemed to me to really be a
  \"revival\" of Jenson, if one applied the same standard to them as one would to
  a revival of Garamond, Baskerville, or Caslon.\r\n\r\nThe only one that seemed to
  me to be a version - yes, \"trued up\", but otherwise it wouldn't have been usable
  - of Jenson's actual original typeface was Eusebius, by Robert H. Middleton and
  Ernst Detterer for Ludlow."

      stuff, but I'm concerned that it may not work well in certain situations. Some
      of its... personality... may be overstated, and it's x-height is ...unfashionable.\r\n\r\nQuirks
      that your Goodchild... \"corrects.\"\r\n\r\nI still like a curly-tailed /y/,
      though. Even if it's \"inauthentic.\" I'll look to see if your typeface has
      alternate characters."

    about a Texas newspaper that commissioned an oldstyle typeface, making itself
    rather unique in that field.\r\n\r\nLooking at it, though, I didn't get a Jenson
    \"feel\", but I may not have looked carefully enough. It looked like Palatino
    Book (oops, sorry, Aldus) if anything at first glance. With a Times or Corona
    level x-height, though, it's hard for a layman like myself to see the essence
    beneath the surface."

      without the slight slant. Good for news!

  body: Thank you for making your typeface's closeness to the original Jenson more
    apparent. Although that top serif on the lowercase h was corrected to meet current
    practice (which makes sense to avoid startling newspaper readers), it's now clear
    to me that this is indeed quite authentic.

    faces!\r\n\r\nAnd Jenson Oldstyle, even if it owes more to Morris than Jenson,

  body: "As I argued [[http://ilovetypography.com/2010/07/26/reviving-caslon-the-snare-of-authenticity/|here]],
    I think the pursuit of 'authenticity' is a snare. You can try to capture features
    of any of the old types, but trying to mimic the look you end up with a type that
    is only of antiquarian interest. Jenson is one of the greatest types, and people
    keep trying to capture its magic in different ways and with varying success. \r\n\r\nMy
    own view is that they need to be evaluated each on their own merits, whether it's
    Centaur, Goodchild, Adobe Jenson, Eusebius, or whatever. "

    that's adapted to current standards enough to be usable - but which is very close
    to the original in all respects not constrained by that, so that it keeps the
    feel of the original!\r\n\r\nOf course, that isn't quite clear enough yet. Doesn't
    Cloister Oldstyle capture the \"feel\" of Jenson's typeface?\r\n\r\nSo perhaps
    what I'm praising is what others would esteem less. To be a revival of a previous
    typeface, and not simply a new typeface taking inspiration from that typeface,
    instead of striving for an original creation, after doing what is necessary to
    avoid the type being unfit for its intended purpose, the type designer needs to
    be imitative rather than creative.\r\n\r\nArt will still be present, as there's
    no mechanical way to \"true up\" an incunabular typeface, but we move on the spectrum
    towards craftsmanship and away from fine art.\r\n\r\nOh, and to avoid confusion:
    among modern digital faces, what I'm thinking of is Nicolas Jenson SG, <em>not</em>
    Jenson Eusebius."

    Rogers has this to say of Eusebius: \"It was a much more faithful reproduction
    of Jenson's letter than Centaur or Cloister.\" \r\n\r\nThough he was of course
    writing long before some of the other modern 'revivals' came into being... I do
    think you'd be hard pressed to find a more strictly faithful recreation than Eusebius.\r\n\r\nI'd
    venture to suggest that the Doves Press Roman might have earned a similar distinction...
    if it had survived, at least. :("
