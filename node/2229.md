  body: Julia, it probably is Stymie they had to convert it to outlines to make the
    medal for the o so how hard would it be to change the y, five minutes maybe.

  body: The &#39;t&#39; matches Bitstream&#39;s Stymie, but the &#39;y&#39; &#40;horizontally
    flipped&#41; matches URW&#39;s. But this is Stymie, alright.
