    live so far away, I'd come, too. As it so happens, the Offenbach (near Frankfurt,
    Germany) <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/typostammtisch/pool/\">Typostammtisch</a>
    meets tonight. We've successfully pulled this off every month for over three years
    now, and even tangentially inspired a similar sort of event in <a href=\"http://www.fontwerk.com/504/berliner-typostammtisch-0707-zusammenfassung/\">Berlin</a>.
    Good luck! This sort of thing should happen more often\u2026"

    The timing seems appropriate for a post-TypeCon debrief, if nothing else. I\u2019ll
    also see if I can convince a few additional Veer-types to show up."

    including the TypeCon program.  Perhaps our recording secretary would like to
    add pertinent details?\r\n\r\n<em>Did Mark behave himself?</em>\r\n\r\nHe was

  body: "A belated report on our last meeting:\r\n\r\nEverything went swimmingly.
    Mark from Veer attended and offered great advice on moving our club forward, participated
    in the Name Debate, reported on TypeCon and gave insights into Veer's workings.
    Mark, thanks for attending. And thankyou for your generosity! Completely uncalled
    for but still much appreciated. We bought a round to toast your health!!\r\n\r\nMark
    left a bag of Veer-Swag, including Activity Books and buttons, which will be available
    to attendees of our September meeting.\r\n\r\nDave B. reported that he was moved
    to leave the lurker pool and become a member of Typophile. I don't think he's
    posted anything yet, but it's nice to have another Calgary face on Typophile.
    (If I can get on my soapbox for a bit...this is exactly how I see a type club
    working. It's a chance for people with an interest in type to meet, share resources
    and foster enthusiasm. Oh, yeah, and there's beer.) Congratulations, Dave, and
    welcome to Typophile!\r\n\r\nThe great Name Debate is still ongoing. We've short-listed
    our favourites and we'll decide on one of those in September. Dave apparently
    wasn't satisfied with merely submitting names...he showed up with logos! So, in
    typical type-geek fashion, we've picked a logo already even though we haven't
    settled on a name. How does that work? (Hopefully Dave will post the logo for
    critique on this forum.)\r\n\r\nLex was unable to attend, and we want his input
    on the Name Debate. So, Lex, you've got a month to come up with something better
    than what we've short-listed!\r\n\r\nOn the agenda for the September meeting:
    Mike's illustrated letters, discussion of a membership push at the local Art+Design
    College, the possibility of getting a local gallery to host a Type Show. And Lex's
    report on how the movie is going ;-)\r\n\r\n"

    of the month (which translates to January 16th).\r\n\r\nAs Don mentioned, January
    is a good month for drinking beer with type-minded folk. Cause there ain't nothin'
    else to do."

    be persuaded to hold a special one, if for no other reason than it's a good idea
    to sit, schmooze, and consume beer.  :-)
