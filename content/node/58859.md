body: "Hi everybody!\r\nI'd like to get some criticism about a logo I'm working on
  for a contest in my design school.\r\n\r\nCresco (in english it's GROW) is a project
  which deals with sustainable development. It helps companies to share their sustainable
  ''habits'' with citizens, and its main areas of activities are:\r\n-energy saving\r\n-recycling\r\n-sustainable
  transport\r\n\r\nAs for my entry, I decided to approach the broader concept of ''sustainable
  development'' rather than focusing on one of the 3 areas (and hence leaving the
  other 2 out).\r\nAfter some sketching I came out with this pictogram which symbolizes
  a human being ''growing'' from leaves (nature - the environment).\r\nMy choice of
  lowercase letters tries to make the logo more friendly, and I chose these fonts
  (avant garde and futura) because their kind of ''circle based'' and it connects
  them to the pyctogram, which is round.\r\nAlso, they're \"safe\" fonts.\r\n\r\nI'm
  not happy with it though, what do you think?\r\n"

  body: "My initial impressions; I couldn't tell that was a person in the background,
    a little too vague with just a circle on top of a box. Also, is there a reason
    for the green \"o\" at the end of \"cresco?\" Conceptually, is there a better
    symbol or group of symbols that will more effectively communicate these sustainable
    habits? I see soooo many leaves and the color green on all these eco-friendly,
    sustainable this-and-that logos that they all start to melt together. Green noise,
    if you will.\r\n\r\nAgain, just an initial impression, and I'm very interested
    to see if anyone has ideas regarding alternative ways to communicate the whole
    \"green\" concept."

  body: "It's a start, and it shows you're thinking which is a great start.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I agree about the greenwashing/use of leaves is done to death, I'm going to leave
    that.\r\n\r\nWhat you've got just isn't friendly in any way. Sustainability (in
    this capacity) is about people making a difference, changing the way they behave,
    consume and ultimately their impact on the environment.\r\n\r\nThe mark you currently
    has feels totally sterile and clinical. \r\n\r\nSure lowercase letters can (in
    general) give the impression of a more relaxed and casual organisation ... but
    type choice still affects the response - so pay attention.\r\n\r\nWe say it over
    and over, but we can't say it enough. Sketch your ideas (with pen and paper) new
    avenues will pop up, they always do. Develop the idea and go from there.<br />\r\n<br

  body: visually, the green "o" is receding a bit, and appearing to be smaller than
    the black "cresc". I think you may need to make it a bit bigger so that it visually
    appears to be the same size.

  body: Recently I read that blue is the new green. And considering the Earth is mostly
    water there is a bit of sense to that. I do agree that the mark is sterile looking,
    I'd like to see it morph into something more organic. To me the person and leaves
    don't necessarily say -energy saving -recycling -sustainable transport, they could
    just as easily represent a landscaper. I'm with Paul get some paper and start
    sketching, and a good observation by Natalie, you may want to tweak the size of
    the "o"

  body: "Thanks everybody for the suggestions :)\r\nhere are some sketches I made
    before and after posting here.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sketches1_3823.jpg]
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/sketches2_3979.jpg]\r\n(No scanner, have to
    take pics with my 50mm, sorry]\r\n\r\nI'm finding really hard to find an effective,
    and possibly ''unseen'' way to convey the idea of sustainable development .\r\nAs
    Coe said, there's a lot of ''green noise'' around, and searching in books and
    on the internet for inspiration isn't really helpful, it just makes you think
    that EVERYTHING has been already thought of. Are there really so many green companies
    out there? :D\r\n\r\nThe concept of my icon isn't groundbreaking, but I can't
    focus just in one of the areas of the project (energy/transport/recycling). the
    job would be easier if I could concentrate in only one of them, but I would leave
    the other 2 out.\r\n\r\nAnyway I tried to fix it to make it look more like a person\r\nSee
    here: http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/6852/picture3qea.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nWould
    you suggest to walk away from it and pursue some other idea from the sketches?\r\nMaybe
    something more typographic as a green O / O as a leave... etc?\r\n"

    angle. For a less corporate, more natural feel, consider doing something less
    geometric/rigid. Take a look at the Legacy Timber logo on [[http://www.atomic74.com/work/corporate-identity|Tungsten''s]]
    portfolio. I think there is potential in exploring this type of stylistic route. '

    with different matters :) \r\n\r\nI know it doesn't look like it's growing from
    the leaves, but also I don't think that it HAS to look like it is.\r\nThat was
    my first idea, but then playing around with other sketches I came out with this,
    which shows man and nature as different beings, and also as a whole - a visual
    metaphore for sustainable development.\r\n\r\nMakes sense?\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for
    my bad english, I hope you understood what I'm trying to say :)"

    do like how the three green 'parts' are leaves, though.\r\n\r\nIn your sketches,
    I also see you have arrows on the end of the 'e' ... that's a really appealing
    idea to me-- perhaps you could work those in on the 'e' like in the second sketch
    you posted, or even have them on the 's' instead of the 'e'.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n<sub>\\\\\\<a

  body: I really like the latest logo, I think a bit of tweaking is in order with
    the leaves but it's a strong concept and I don't think there's anything wrong
    with the rotating look...recycling. I think the type should be softer and more
    organic...currently it isn't doing much for me.

    it before June 19th so that was my entry for the school-contest.\r\nAlthough I
    recognize that both the leaves and the type might benefit with some tweaking,
    so, just for design's sake, HOW would you have achieved a more organic look with
    the leaves, and what font(s) would you have used for the text? :-)\r\n\r\nOh,
    about the e with arrows... it's a concept i didn't develop because that was something
    I saw between the sketches of a classmates of mine for another green logo (this
    time a school assignment) and I would have felt like an idea-thief ;)"

    criticism.\r\n\r\nThis is how it looks like at the end, after a direct confrontation

    you think the type got (at least a little bit) better?\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I would
    like to hear some suggestions about another version of the logo they asked me
    to design for them.\r\nThe text they require is \"isola cresco\" (cresco island)
    and it's like a ''medal'' they would give to cities which are parts of the project.\r\nThey
    want to retain the same graphic symbol but they were thinking of having the text
    running around in a circle.\r\nI don't think it would work, but I dont think either
    that having the same symbol and a different text would work. \r\nI fear it would
    only create confusion with the main logo, especially because on its first period.\r\nWhat
    do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
