  want to create alternate uppercase glyphs without the swash that will be used as
  a default after an initial cap. Problem is, I'm not sure how to create them so that
  they're interpreted by a design program in the correct way.\r\n\r\nI'm still learning
  Fontlab but have created three weights, set the metrics, kerned and included ligatures
  \u2013 this is my last stumbling block so I'd really appreciate the help.\r\n\r\nThanks
  everyone\r\n\r\nStew\r\n"

  body: "From your description it sounds like you have swashes on the default form
    of the caps? If so, the following would work.\r\n\r\nfeature calt {\r\nsub [@Swash
    @NoSwash] @Swash' by @NoSwash;\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\nWhere @Swash and @NoSwash have
    been defined to to include your default caps and your swashless caps, respectively.\r\n\r\nI'd
    suggest, though, that it would be better to use your swashless forms as the default
    and then include\r\n\r\nfeature swsh {\r\nignore sub [@Letters] @NoSwash';\r\nsub
    @NoSwash' by @Swash;\r\n} swsh;\r\n\r\nWhere @Letters is the set of all upper
    and lowercase letters defined in your font. This would provide a (IMO) more intuitive
    interface where swashes are turned on by activating them rather than turned off
    by deactivating contextual alternates.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
