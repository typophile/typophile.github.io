  body: The fox quickly realized he was unable to jump onto an impassive dog.

  body: That's one of the greatest things ever. Although I'd prefer if the dog was
    more obviously lazy. He appears more nonchalant. But since "nonchalant" has no
    "s", "y" or "z" it's not much help to us.

  body: I may be missing the joke, but is there more to that picture? With IE7 on
    WinXP, I only see the dog and a little green grass.

  body: "Interesting. Using Firefox on WinXP, the picture is an animated .GIF, and
    a brown fox jumps on, and then off, of the dog's back.\r\n\r\nOf course, packing
    a box with five dozen liquor jugs is something so pedestrian that it has no doubt
    happened countless times. Although usually, one packs a cardboard box with only
    one dozen liquor bottles."

  body: I always imagined a jump with a little more grace. Ideally the dog would be
    laying down. And the fox could de quicker.
