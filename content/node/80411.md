    the \"100 FEET\". Why the \"1\"? Why there?\r\nAlways start in black & white,
    then add colour."

  body: "Thanks riccard0\r\n\r\nThis is an image of a standard altimeter: \r\nhttp://www.recreationalflying.net/tutorials/groundschool/altimeter1.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
    \"1\" instead of \"I\" is to make a connection between the altimeter and the name.
    The arrow of the altimeter would point the \"1\" when flying AMILPIES (at 1000
    feet)\r\n\r\nThe choice of colours helps establish this connection, although for
    a pilot or anybody involved in flying the connection would work even in b&w, I'd
    say.\r\n\r\nI'll show you other options."

    the intended target? If so, they will recognise the altimeter even without words
    and numbers.\r\nIf the \"1\" stands for \"1000\", why not replace the first \"I\"
    (the \"MIL\" one)?\r\nEven better, why not insert it in the \"M\"?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/m1_4432.png]\r\n\r\nAlso,

    guess the last one is simple enough to guarantee a good reductibility."

    rid of one of the tick marks, but the #1 is related to them (see picture of a

    a 1-lower-case-m monogram and investigate other options.

    ripping off the 1 Million logo. \r\n\r\nBut if that weren't enough to convince
    you, I'd have to ask if it even makes sense now to have a 1 after \"a?\" \r\n\r\nThis
    is no longer the word you want us to read. It's a-1-milpies. (note the original
    concept you're \"referencing\" did not read as \"million,\" but \"1 million.\")
    So it's not the execution stage where this is failing, it's the initial concept.
    You can't create a good logo no matter how well executed if the concept isn't
    there."

    look more a hieroglyphic than a logo and yes, the obvious similarity with 1million
    is upsetting me too.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I'll have to explore new ways, perhaps
    keep with the altimeter idea, because substituting a letter I for a #1 seems to
    be widely used too.\r\nhttp://img.printfection.com/14/339727/pSNZ2.jpg\r\nhttp://logopond.com/logos/d0a8c093ce9fca0ff538267b48421273.png\r\n\r\nI'll
