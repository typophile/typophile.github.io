  body: Yep, the smaller stuff is Franklin Gothic. The condensed face in the middle
    appears to be <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/alternate-gothic/">Alternate
    Gothic No. 1</a> and the face at the top is an old wood typeface. An old type
    catalog I have only gives it a number--735--no name.
