body: "ok, so designing while half asleep isn't the greatest! But I need to show the
  client something in the morning. I know there's spacing things and kerning I need
  to fix up. But I'm just wanting some feed back on the general concept to start with,
  then we can get into the kerning :)\r\n\r\nThe Brief:\r\n\r\nClient is building
  a site to show video of different atheletes to industry type folks. I'm not completely
  sure on all the details. Basically they are thinking they need an identity mark
  something like the nike, adidas, puma style logo. The client is a fan of <a href=\"http://www.31three.com\">this
  designer </a> as am I. The main thing about this of course is establishing their
  own identity. It's probably too big of a job for me to figure out in a couple nights,
  but here's start and I'm hoping that someone can help me as to which direction to
  go and possible enhancements I can make before handing in the first draft. \r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help and understanding!"

    for \"access athletics\".\r\n\r\nI think you have a couple interesting marks there,
    but none of them come off as being very ahtletic to me. It would be nice to see
    a bit more movement in the design. More energy."

  body: "I think you can reject the bottom three logos immediately. There are many
    questions that need to be answered, first is what does the client do, why do industry
    types (what industry?) want to see video of athletes, does he/she make videos
    or perhaps offer athletes for sponsorship or draw more people to athletics? I
    know you say you are unsure of the details but you need to find out some details,
    you seem to be implying you need an athletic-type logo but why would that appeal
    to industry types? Without answers you are left with type responses and geometric
    shapes, that being so I think the top left and middle left offer potential.\r\nHope
    this is not too discouraging, but for your sake and your client's try and get
    some details.\r\nTim"

  body: for Tim, I think what they do is give a way for talent scouts of teams a place
    on the web to view video footage of atheletes

  body: "What kind of image does the client want for themselves? Your ideas are all
    over the map, which isn't necessarily a bad thing for brainstorming, but it implies
    that you don't really have a strong direction to go with this logo.\r\n\r\nDoes
    the client wish to be perceived as fun or professional, well-established or up-and-coming,
    etc.?\r\n\r\nIf you haven't done so already, talk this kind of thing through with
    the client and post the results here. It will be more helpful for you, and for
    us to give you critique on the logos.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I like the direction you're taking #5. It has the energy I was talking about.
    I think it still is type heavy though. The A and S in Athletics are not lining
    up with the edges of the A and the S in Access ...kind of looks like you just
    selected them all and hit center vertically. The type treatments still all look
    very similar. Maybe explore that area a little more.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side,
    you're giving the client a lot to choose from. I just spoke with someone the other
    day who sent ONE concept to a client. Can you believe that?"

  body: but if it's the right one it's cool, I talked to the client today and have
    some further thoughts for different directions, sorry for posting all of these
    brainstorming concepts. I guess this forum doesn't suit that super well. I'll
    post up again when there's something more established. Thanks for all the help,
    was good!

  body: alright, got some better direction now. I'm just working on the icon right
    now, haven't got the text in there. Either of these 2 are probably where we'll
    end up. Any thoughts?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/access-athletics-logo_4089.jpg]

    that form might not be applicable to Canada, the figure also strikes me as too
    masculine. Have you thought of a double a mark, possibly one enclosed by the other
    or a reflected version?\r\n\r\nTim"
