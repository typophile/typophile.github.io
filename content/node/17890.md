body: Just thought you might be interested in knowing what happened to one of the
  best book stores in NYC, Untitled. Well it now sells fine italian shoes (you know
  one of those places where they have 10 shoes in the whole store), and the decor
  of the place is really bad.

  body: New York has gone to hell in a handbag (I'm sure they sell those too at that
    fancy italian store). It's so sad.
