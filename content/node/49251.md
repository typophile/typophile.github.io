  body: Water is the giver of life.  With out it, we can't survive. Balancing the
    intake of water should be practiced coz lack of it is not good at all.  Lack of
    water may cause you some skin problems or other types of diseases because the
    toxic on our body is not being thrown away thru perspiration or vowel movement.
