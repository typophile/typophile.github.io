body: "Hi I am working on an Organic Wine label.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a font that
  is clean, understated and contemporary. I want a font that looks soooo good with
  out screaming look at me. A font that a designer might say \u201CI want to know
  what that font is. A font the average consumer won\u2019t see anything unique with
  but they will sense quality. A font for an organic wine consumer who shaves her
  legs (target market).\r\n\r\nAm I asking to much? I thought I\u2019d toss it out
  there.\r\n"

    flecked recycled stock. It will have an earthy quality but I don't want a distressed
    type font.\r\n\r\nNick, these woman are good with a razor."

  body: "Nick, Excellent font. I purchased the single regular pro version. I did not
    see the light available that was mentioned in the PDF, perhaps that is only available
    as part of the family package?\r\n\r\nJupiter boy great script. Not the look I
    am shooting for for this project but I can see using it on a wine label defiantly.\r\n\r\nAny
    thoughts about these other fonts:\r\n\r\nNew Prairie\r\ncronospro\r\nGoudy\r\nGoudy
    Sans\r\noptima\r\nqwestal\r\nwarnock pro\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPattie"

  body: "Well I am only going to show them the layout with Paradigm and see if they
    bite. Another designer had worked on this project before I took over. The only
    thing that worked on her concept was her type treatment, which was with Optima
    for the brand name, so they might ask me to incorporate that into the layout.
    Comparing Optima to your font I see the softness and more organic nature of you
    font is a better fit for the product. I am hoping they prefer it.\r\n\r\nCan you
    recommend any other fonts that would complement this font?"

  body: "How about Caflisch Script?\r\nIt's casual because it's a script, but it's
    also very disciplined and sophisticated, and the OpenType alternates make for
    a very \"organic\" font!\r\nIf you are using Paradigm U&lc large, you could also
    try it as \"all small caps\" at text size, with the Caflisch, that would be a
    nice triad of typographic forms."

    has a very famous typographic label design that uses Optima, so research that
    one.

    I am thinking back label lots of tiny copy. \r\n\r\nThey like the label so far."
