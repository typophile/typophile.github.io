  used as mathematical notation by Frege in 1893, I would dearly love to know its
  origin. It is extremely close to the face used by J. H. Geiger (Lahr) in \"Des Lahrer
  Hinkenden Boten neuer historischer Kalender f\xFCr den B\xFCrger und Landmann auf
  das Jahr 1883\", used by Gilles Le Corre as the basis for his \"1883-Fraktur\".
  \ The differences are very slight, visible to me only in the roundedness and directions
  of the terminators and in the tightness of the upper and lower parts of the A and
  F.  Hence I suspect that the above font is also due to Geiger, but an earlier or
  later version of that used in the \"historischer Kalender\".  It would be too much
  to ask that someone has access to a specimen-book for Geiger (if such exists), but
  one never knows!  Any other comments would be most welcome."

  body: "I don't know the answer to your origins question, other than to agree with
    Les that it seems to be a variant of the Luther fraktur.\r\nThis font was designed
    by Erasmus Luther in 1708. It falls between the earlier Gebetbuch Fraktur and
    the later Breitkopf Fraktur.\r\nI can give you some links to fonts with fraktur
    symbols for mathematical notation: \r\nA classical fraktur Brill http://kltf.de/kltf_seen_brillfraktur.shtml
    \r\nA simplified fraktur, Mathematica-6b font from Wolfram http://support.wolfram.com/kb/10427\r\nLuc
    Devroye's page on mathematics fonts http://luc.devroye.org/math.html\r\nLuc Devroye
    also has an extensive web page on Fraktur http://luc.devroye.org/fraktur.html
    If you dig through the many fonts mentioned, it is possible that you might find
    an exact match which includes some information on the original designer of the
    typeface.\r\nFor what is in effect a digital encyclopedia of Fraktur see the fonts
    digitized by Gerhard Helzel http://www.fraktur.biz/ For some comments on Mr. Helzel's
    project see the following web page by Luc Devroye http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-23582.html\r\nBTW
    the Frege Fraktur looks very similar to a pre-WWII typewriter typeface. This might
    support a theory that the Fege typeface is very close to to the basic fraktur
    design used in books. Here is a typescript of the letters.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FrakturschriftTypewriter_5802.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: "Don,\r\n\r\nThanks for your interesting post -- Helzel's page is certainly
    a goldmine!  The closest I could find in his Schriftmappe is the Weber Normalfraktur
    (Weber-Fraktur norm. on p. 2); this has an F with the same bulb terminating the
    mid-arm (a rather uncommon feature of Fraktur it seems, most seem to stay true
    to their calligraphic origin), but the Frege Fraktur's F has the arm higher and
    pointing upwards, it also has a more compact lower stroke ending with a tighter
    curl.  \r\n\r\nJim"
