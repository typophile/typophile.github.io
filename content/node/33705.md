body: "When i export a pdf from indesign, the 'i' in the logo stands out. In the Indesign
  document, the logo is a vector object (not type  or placed eps). This is how the
  pdf looks  like in acrobat pro. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ouch!_5367.jpg]\r\n\r\nIs
  there a way to avoid this eyesore?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nalex"

  body: "It looks a bit like bad hinting.\r\nBut, if you zoom in/out, usually such
    glitches disappear?\r\nIt shouldn't show up in print, anyway. I'm not sure what
    you can do about it on screen."

  body: Nah, I meant that it looks similar. I don't think it applies to vector objects
    as it does to typefaces.

  body: I think Jelmar is right -- it's just an artifact of viewing a vector object
    at a zoom other than 100%. If you're concerned about whether the problem will
    occur in the real world when the logotype's at something other than actual size,
    you may want to make several rasterized (pixel) versions of it at a few different
    resolutions. Then, if any of those seem odd, you can manually adjust them in Photoshop.

  body: "If you open the pdf with Illustrator does it render as a stroke? Not that
    I know the answer, I have had similar happen though and at some scales it looks
    fine. Could it be down to how you make the pdf, have you tried alternative ways
    of making them or alternative types of pdf (press quality, small file size, default
    etc.)?\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Well, I guess the one-million-dollar question is... Does it show when you
    print it? It looks like your screeen shot was taken at 100%, which usually means
    one is seeing a fairly accurate representation of how the document will print.
    But I'd rather see a raster image of the .pdf transported out of Illustrator and
    cropped.\r\n\r\nIf it still looks ugly when you print it then there are one-million
    more questions that need to be answered, such as: Exactly what you mean when you
    say \"vector object?\" Was the logo created in InDesign using the vector drawing
    tools, or was it created in some other program and then transported in somehow?
    If so what was the logo's original format? I don't mean \"vector\", there are
    a bunch of different vector formats, .ai, .eps, .wmf, .pic, .myd, even .pdf itself
    (just to name a few). Each have varying support in Acrobat. Which one was the
    file originally saved as? Which version of InDesign are you using? Which version
    of Acrobat are you using? Which version of Distiller are you using?\r\n\r\nThere
    are probably more where that came from, but see how it prints first :) Good luck!"

  body: "I had a similar problem today, added a 0,25 pt outline to a vector object
    (copy-pasted from Illustrator). In pdf it really stands out, but when I zoom closer
    it's ok. The same when the pdf is opened in Illustrator, no problem there. Could
    it be just that the screen doesn't show it correctly?\r\nI haven't actually tried
    printing it yet."

    body: Try printing it, but it's never a good idea to copy/paste. Imports (file/place)
      are really the only way for InDesign & then Distiller to handle the vector algorithms
      correctly. If you've done that and still have problems then, as I said above,
      there are one-million more questions. BTW, are you sure you're using distiller
      and not a pdf writer?

  body: "I believe it really is just a glitch in the PDF or Acrobat rendering engine.
    I see it too every now and then, but I can't remember that it showed up in print.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, you are probably safer off if you <em>do</em> place an eps or something
    similar, instead of actually pasting the vectors in InDesign,  as Elizabeth already
    said.\r\nAt least, I always find that the conversion that takes place when pasting,
    is somewhat crude. I'm sure it is probably okay most of the times, but I always
    feel a bit uncomfortable with the results."

  body: "I've noticed the same thing happening in PDF's created from Illustrator.\r\n\r\nSo
    far I've not had a problem with the final printing of any design that's done this
    on screen though.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty certain it's a result of Adobe Reader's raster
    engine's preference to whole pixels for straight edges. Overall it's probably
    a good thing as it's possibly the only reason the address is still readable in
    the image you posted.\r\n\r\nI guess it's similar to font hinting in a way, but
    for screen pixels instead.\r\n\r\nIf it changes at diffent zoom levels then I
    dont' think you have anything to worry about.\r\n\r\nIf you are using PDF's to
    proof the job with the client and you don't want them to see the glitch then I
    think converting the logo to high res pixels is the only option."
