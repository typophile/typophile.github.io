body: Hi, I would appreciate some help in identifying the typeface used here here.
  &#40;see below&#41;. It looks like a cross between Stone Sans and Charlotte &#40;Linotype&#41;
  - but it is neither. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10812.gif"

    Yves were awake right now they&#39;d have an <BR>answer for you already.&#41;
    But can&#39;t shake it loose from my brain. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s got similar strokes
    to <a href="http://www.porcheztypo.com/Custom/Costa.html" target="_blank">Costa</a>,
    especially the &#39;T&#39;.

    not it. <BR>So I am going to take a big leap again and say FOSTER&#39;S <BR>started

  body: Thanks Stephen .. you&#39;re halfway there - There are similarities in the
    fonts you suggested, and most likely it might be a custom variation.

  body: Reminds me of Jeremy Tankard&#39;s BLISS, similar shapes, but the R isn&#39;t
    this soft and a few of the terminals end differently.

  body: Sure looks like Cronos to me -- I don&#39;t even see the subtle variations.
    Even the apostrophe looks right, though rotated a bit &#40;hard to tell with the
    outline of the inset box going right through it, however&#41;. If it&#39;s not
    Cronos, I think it must be adapted from it.

  body: This is most definitely derived from Cronos.  <BR>Chesh, the subtle derivations
    are in the terminals of  <BR>the primary strokes. In Cronos they have subtle curves  <BR>and
    tapers. But in the Foster&#39;s sample, these terminals  <BR>look like they have
    been squared off -- see the back  <BR>corners of the E and the bottom of the R
    stem. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>
