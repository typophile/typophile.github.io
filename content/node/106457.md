  case is for a sans-serif, but any thoughts (or links) appreciated.

  body: "I don\u2019t know what IPA small capitals are. \r\n\r\nPetite capitals are
    optically aligned with the x-height. They are mostly good for display work, for
    example in a logotype. There aren\u2019t that many typefaces with petite caps
    and small caps, but there are plenty of typefaces with small caps at \u201Cpetite\u201D
    height (confused?).\r\n\r\nSmall caps are usually noticably taller than the x-height.
    In modern typography, they are mostly used for acronyms and words/names set in
    capitals in a line of otherwise mixed-case/lowercase words. Traditionally, small
    caps have been used to mark beginnings of chapters. The modern usage intends to
    blend in and not get noticed, the traditional usage is a stylistic one where being
    noticed is the whole point.\r\n\r\nSmall caps and petite caps might also differ
    in weight, width, detailing, and structure. There is no clear recipe. It all depends
    on what task you want them to fulfill."

  body: "IPA small capitals are the symbols used by linguists to represent phonemes
    and such. They're encoded in their own Unicode block with other phonetic symbols.
    \r\n\r\nBarring general advice (which may have been too broad of a question anyway),
    I was curious about two things, mainly. First, for those that have designed them
    before, if the small/petite cap glyphs might be reused for the IPA, or if people
    design new distinct glyphs for these characters. Second, is there any trend about
    when petite vs small caps are used, like maybe it's a history of German vs British
    traditions, or something."

  body: "I like my small caps small. Which is to say as a typographer I prefer petite
    caps for everything, even in running text. I dislike small caps that are taller
    than x-height. But that's just me.\r\n\r\nCertainly the IPA symbols should not
    be taller than X height."

  body: "There's no \"purpose,\" it's just an aesthetic preference. I find the discontinuity
    between the established line of the x-height and things that are <em>almost</em>
    the same height to be distracting.\r\n\r\nBut I've certainly used typefaces with
    small caps that are taller than x-height, and I've often left them that way, though
    sometimes I've shrunk them slightly to match.\r\n\r\n(Also, I could clarify that
    I'm usually typesetting literary fiction and not, say, trendy magazine copy.)"

  body: Lining things up should be reserved for display. I would argue for making
    the difference clear, though. (And also for putting aesthetic preference in the
    back seat.)

  body: IPA small caps are intended to be mixed among lowercase letters, so they should
    match those in height. Otherwise, I prefer small caps that are clearly taller
    than x-height (for typesetting academic books, where small caps may be performing
    a function other than just decoration).

    body: "That\u2019s true though strictly speaking when used for IPA even <em>abc</em>
      are not lower case, as it is a unicameral script \u2014 IPA has no distinction
      between lower and upper case letters. However the alphabet was designed on the
      basis of Latin lowercase letters, and I have never seen a typeface that departed
      from this usage. On the other hand IPA makes a clearcut distinction between
      pairs like \u0280\u2013r \u0274\u2013n \u0251\u2013a \u0292\u2013z etc.\r\nWhat
      is important when designing an IPA font is the fact that there must be room
      enough for diacritics above and below the letters. Those may be used in unpredictable
      ways and even be stacked, thus: [\u0280\u0325\u026A\u0303\u0300\u0274\u0329\u0301],
      which should display like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IPA_accents_5121.png]\r\nTechnically
      the best IPA fonts currently available are certainly those produced by SIL International\u2019s
      [[http://scripts.sil.org|Non-Roman Script Initiative]], especially Victor Gaultney\u2019s
      <em>Gentium Plus</em>.\r\n\r\nI think the choice of small or petite caps depends
      to some extent on the language for which they are used. For German body text
      I have a strong tendency to use petite caps (x-height), as words are frequently
      distinguished on the basis of upper vs. lower case alone in that language. This
      seems to increase reading speed significantly."
