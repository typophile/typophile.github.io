  rough edges. Myfonts mentions that designer Alan Blackman based the glyphs on some
  original Sans Serif lettering. I can't however find any Sans Serif font that would
  be linked to him.\r\n\r\nAny guesses?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/galahad/"

    goes on to say that Galahad is \u201Ca cross between Optima and the flat-pen writing
    of Friedrich Neugebauer [Austrian calligrapher].\u201D I don't believe there is
    a \"cleaner\" version of Galahad:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Optima_6598.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Galahad_5098.png]"
