  to put my logo, which I designed for a friend to your critisism. What is wrong and
  what is good?\r\n\r\nThanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/connect_5038.jpg]"

    like they're one coherent unit. They're spaced too far apart from each other in
    all of these examples.\r\n\r\nWhat are these logos for? I assume this was designed
    just for fun as \"connect.com\" and \"direct.com\" are already taken.\r\n\r\n

    and get some good ideas on paper before hitting photoshop.

    with clashmore, you'd benefit by starting on paper then using Illustrator. This
    screenshot is actually Photoshop, but I assume that's not what you used to create
    the logo, right?"

  body: "Ok, first, I thought, after 24 hours, to get some 'constructive' critisism.
    Things like ' I really don't like Serpentine' don't help me - 'Mountain Dew'???
    Sorry, doesn't say anything to me, maybe because I am on the other side. Why is
    Serpentine not right (I think it is a nice 'speedy' font) and which one would
    be more appropriate??\r\n'They\u2019re spaced too far apart from each other in
    all of these examples' - that is something to work with. I will change this, but
    closing in leaves me no choice than to lift the text and get it a little bit between
    the 'balls', which make it uneven somehow.\r\n'The sentiment behind the concept
    is very dated and the solution looks obvious - by that i mean I have no confidence
    that you\u2019ve put much thought into it' - yes, I did research, but it is difficult
    to come with something brandnew in this segment.\r\nI did the basics in Freehand
    as it is for me very difficult to sketch on paper. The ideas are in my head. but
    I can them realise better with a program than with 'bare' hand. My Freehand docs
    looks like sketches, so... :)\r\nAny other suggestions??\r\n\r\nThanks."

    some-ones personal opinion triggers some-one else his.\r\nI wouldn't worry about
    this.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince you are working on a logo I would loose the shadows.\r\nRemember
    that things have to be printed, placed on websites, cars, stationary ...\r\noften\r\nShadows
    are a pain then. Beside that, they often don't add anything. It often brings an
    amateuristic feel with it. It is often a way of adding something interesting.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is your reason of putting it there?\r\n\r\nAnd, what is your reason to choose
    for yellow?\r\n\r\nI would try and look for an other font. Personaly I do like
    serpentine, but I hardly ever use it because it feels outdated. It has become
    a bit cheapy. Exception are outthere.\r\n\r\nThis together with the logo in front
    of it, it is not a memorable logo. \r\n\r\nYou say you have difficulty in sketching
    on paper. Often this does open new doors.\r\nResearch, look what is out there
    and not te be missed: what kind of company is it? Translate that into a logo and
    I think the one you have now doesn't suit anymore.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."

  body: ":)) That's more like what I expected.\r\n\r\nTo Bobby:\r\nAbout the font:
    ok, I am a little bit short at fonts, and there is no way I purchase them for
    150$ or more just for demonstration. So, I have to go with what I have. Sure,
    I like fonts like Futura, Helvetica, Frutiger, Garamond, and so on, but most of
    the times my clientel doesn't like them as they are too 'simple' (that's what
    customer say - I prefer 'timeless'). So they want something out of the row. Maybe
    you have some suggestions for fonts I could use or would be more appropiate.\r\nAbout
    the shadow, yes, I know, but that's why there is a b/w version at the bottom.\r\nOrange,
    I think is still a color which attract attention without alarming.\r\nTo Aziz:\r\nAbout
    connecting the font. yes, I thought of this, but isn't it too much. And there
    is the problem with direct.com, that it doesn't make sense there to connect the
    fonts. But both logos should look as a unit.\r\nIf I let lead the arrows to the
    circle, it wouldn't have the same impression like the 'connect' version and so
    the unity goes.\r\nto Ross:\r\nThe company is in the hotel-booking and travel
    business (and no, there shouldn't be any hotel or house icons in the logo). There
    will be an addition in the front, like 'Bali-connect.com' or 'Bali-direct.com'
    (just as an example). The icon will then finally move to the other side.\r\nThanks
    for all your comments."

  body: "Sounds like your client would be better off devising a single cohesive, marketable
    brand, rather than registering and trademarking several million nation-prefixed
    domains. That would make your task much easier, and they could then use subdomains
    to cater to every conceivable destination without diluting that brand.\r\n\r\nbali.nongenerictravelbusinessname.com\r\nfiji.nongenerictravelbusinessname.com\r\nchina.nongenerictravelbusinessname.com\r\netc.\r\n\r\nUnless,
    that is, their SEO strategy is to build a massive link farm to attack Google with...
    :/\r\n\r\nAside from that, I wouldn't really associate the words \"direct\" or
    \"connect\" with hotels. One makes me think of flights, the other of telecommunications.
    Also, how is it \"direct\" when the business is acting as a middleman between
    me and my destination hotel?\r\n\r\nI suppose none of this will help you with
    your design, but if the concept is flawed, I don't really see font and color choices
    mattering that much.\r\n\r\n"

    I thought the logos had to be for something like telecommunications, or SOMETHING
    electronical. You said hotel, and nothing clicked. Hotels are suppose to be homey
    like, right? This is too rigid, too technological. Anywho, as for the current
    logo, That symbol is so over used. I swear I've seen it in at least 3 logos. Rather
    well known logos too. So this one will get lost.\r\n\r\nBut yea, those are my
    two sense for now, I don't want to critique the current logo too much, cause I'm
    hoping to see something different after you talk to your client.\r\n\r\ncourtney"
