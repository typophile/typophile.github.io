body: "I'm just getting ready to finalize a font and wanted to be sure the glyph table
  that pulls up in different software applications looked like I wanted it to. I sorted
  the glyphs by encoding, switched to Index mode under Names, switched back to Names
  mode & sorted again by encoding. I saved and generated the font. \r\n\r\nI deleted
  any old versions of the font from Library/Fonts and with Font Explorer, I made sure
  there were not hidden caches of old versions. When I tried my font in a new Illustrator
  file, the glyph table was not as I had planned. It's an alphabetical version. \r\n\r\nI
  am new to Font Explorer and notice that all my font weights of this family are locked.
  I read this means they are part of the system fonts, although I have deleted them
  from the system & they still show up. \r\n\r\nAny ideas?"
