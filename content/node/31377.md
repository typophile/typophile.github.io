  called Air Fire Telephone and Data. The provide various products such as Digital
  Telephone, Internet Access, Server Co-Location, Web Hosting, Data Backup, E-mail/Spam
  Control, Domains, and Network Consulting. Their clientele are business's who rely
  on the internet. They are not after the low end customers. They are after people
  who loss money when the internet is not working for them. The client wants to reinforce
  that they are the most relieable IT company. Any thoughts would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/air-fire-logos_5000.gif]"

  body: I prefer the top one, but maybe use the heavy bold throughout the name "airfire".

  body: "Maybe I'm wrong, but these seem like your first sketches.  I would expand
    your range of concepts.  Right now the bottom one says communications to me more
    than the others, but it's very clich\xE9d.  The flame, while relating to the \"fire\"
    part of the name, doesn't really add anything new and memorable to stand as an
    identity.  The name is interesting and strong. It may not need an additional symbol,
    just a really strong and well-set logotype.\r\n\r\nFocus on what they want to
    be known for: the reliability of their technology.\r\n\r\nFinally, remove \"INC.\"
    from the descriptor.  That's part of their legal business name, but doesn't need
    to be included in the logo."

    be both.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see more of what you come up with in that direction."

  body: I prefer the third one, but the flame looks a bit too simple. Maybe try adding
    more "strokes" to it?
