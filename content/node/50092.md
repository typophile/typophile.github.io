body: "I'm trying to create a MM font to then generate the weights between my Light
  and Bold weights, but I'm getting some strange results with some of the glyphs generated.\r\n\r\nThis
  is the process I'm using to create the MM font:\r\n\r\n1. I have the light and bold
  weights open - these weights oulines have been checked with AFDKO's Fix Contour
  order, sharp angles and start points and Outline check\r\n2. With the light weight
  selected, Tools - Mask - Assign font Mask, and select the Bold weight.\r\n3. Then,
  Tools - Multiple Master - Define New Axis, and select weight.\r\n4. Then select
  all glyphs in the light weight, Tools - Multiple Master - Mask to Master and select
  Wt1\r\n\r\nThis creates the MM fonts, all the glyphs are green which according to
  the manual means the outlines are compatible. When I then generate a weight from
  this some of the glyphs are completely distorted\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_4298.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  distortion only seems to happen when in step 4 - Mask to Master, I select 'Do not
  insert points'.\r\n\r\nIf I leave this unselected all the glyphs are still green
  and the weights produced have no distortion.\r\n\r\nShould I be selecting 'Do not
  insert points' and I have some other problems or I'm I doing something else wrong
  ?\r\n\r\n\r\nRr"

  body: "Rachel,\r\nit looks like your contours are compatible but have different
    start points. You could try generating the MM font with \"Do not insert points\"
    checked and then use the \"Mach Masters\" command to fix the start point inconsistencies."
