  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here's an interesting article about the business of branding: how logos are taking a backseat to names, which suggests exploiting the right typeface for a company's identity is more crucial than ever for graphic identity and retention value: <BR> <BR>Corporations, which have heavily relied on graphic design, logos and too many colorful themes while ignoring the real names, are facing some new challenges. As the logos have lost their power, the companies now have to reinforce their ignored name as a solo warrior. Previously, names were basically seen in print; today they are mainly typed in cyberspace. <BR> <BR>Your logo is not that important these days, as most customers have no motivation to remember the subtle intricacies or bizarre approaches to logos to stimulate a crave. They are already over-flooded with colorful graphic look-a-likes and continuously regenerated blasts from every corner 24/7. <BR> <BR>Today's customers are in need of a simple name to follow and remember until the next time a need arises. <BR> <BR>Names have replaced logos and have dramatically changed the rules of corporate and product branding. <BR> <BR>So what good are names if your customers can't see, hear or speak about them, and what good are the products and services if they are invisible? <BR> <BR>What is quickly killing big branding is the dramatic impact of e-commerce and how a marketing message is delivered to the end user today. Gone are the days of big budget billboards and massive blitzes in print with the constant hammering of fancy corporate logos supported by extensive graphic treatments as the main selling proposition. <BR> <BR>One Single Solution <BR>True, you do need some typeface for your name, and you can easily append a circle or a square or a triangle or a combination thereof and you can select one, two or several colors to go along. That's all that logos are good for now. The more simple the solution, the better. No need to study six months and interview the entire city on whether a circle is better than a square. <BR> <BR> <BR>More details at&hellip; <BR><a href="http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/40164.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/40164.html">http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/40164.html</a></a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Leon, interesting that you stumbled on this article too - I posted a link on my site to it on Wednesday - I too found it interesting, and somewhat disappointing.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps someone could make a PDF showing how many of the best logos would appear if they were simply typed in the source font with default spacing and no tweaks by a designer. Send that back to this chap and see what he says.  <BR> <BR>FedEx springs to mind as a logo that would fail if it weren't for the mods made by the designer. I'm sure there are other less obvious examples. <BR> <BR>Si</div>
