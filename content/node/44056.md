  entirely related with this topic), so I decided to repost it.\r\n\r\nSo, I am bout
  to finnish my thesis within physical chemistry that contains a couple of mathematical
  equations with greek characters in them. Everyone uses times new roman and i' trying
  to stay out of that as far as possible. So far I just have minion in my mind...maybe
  together with myriad.\r\n\r\nAnd as a general question, which font would you pick
  for a informal science newsletter/book?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nvasco"

    the headings, tables etc.)\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: I use Minion for almost all of my academic work (with Myriad for footnotes).
    I've also used Hoefler with Gill Sans Light for footnotes to great effect.

  body: "Congrats in finishing your thesis.\r\n\r\nSome universities dictate what
    fonts/sizes are acceptable (and will summarily reject others), so be sure your
    institution doesn't have specific rules already. (Went through this with mine
    -- our faculty could do what it wanted, but everyone else governed by the Faculty
    of Grad Studies had to use Courier. Go figure.)\r\n\r\nMinion/Myriad, Stone Serif/Sans,
    and Hoefler/GSL would all make fine match-ups, and would add Centaur and Helvetica
    as well -- I've seen a number of academic/science papers set with that combo that
    were quite fetching."

  body: I might try Gentium, as well, if you're a starving student and don't need
    bold/bold italic for your Greek.
