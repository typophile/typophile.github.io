  body: "I searched through the Strange, Distressed Scripts in the Script Guide (part
    14), but couldn't find a match for this. Basically, the same comment in the FAQ
    about handwritten scripts applies to this style. Anyone can make a font like this
    for almost no money, and with no real effort.\r\n\r\nThe closest resemblance I
    found was a font called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/young-itch-aoe/
    target=\"new\">Young Itch</a> from Astigmatic One Eye. \r\n\r\nYou could also
    browse for Grunge styles at free font sites, and maybe find something close enough,
    or get real lucky and find the same font.\r\n- Mike Yanega"
