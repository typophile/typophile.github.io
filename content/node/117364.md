body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo W_6657.F..jpg]\r\n\r\nI need to recreate
  this logo and finally identified the typeface (Gabriola). Now I'm trying to find
  out where the typographic ornament came from. I traced the element in Illustrator
  but it is hard to tell from this low resolution image how close I am to the original.
  I discovered that this character is called a hedera. Learn something new everyday!
  If anyone can ID this, I'd appreciate it. This is my first post to this forum so
  I hope I've posted this request correctly!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nTrina"
