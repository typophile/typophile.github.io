  \ One's called free wifi.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I click on these, it never gives
  me any internet connection?\r\n\r\nWhat are these for and how do they differ from
  normal networks?"

  body: "As far as I understand, a computer-to computer network allows you to connect
    to another machine (which user created a (computer-to-computer\u2013) network)
    for sharing files etc with this user (their computer will show up when you go
    to \"network\" in your Finder window and vice versa). It will only give you an
    internet connection, if the user you are connected to is connected to the internet
    via modem or via another network(-cable) and has enabled sharing their internet
    connection. \r\n\r\nDon't know if that explainantion made any sense to you at
    all...\r\nbut you'll probably get a amore qualified answer asking this at some
    sort of mac-support forum."
