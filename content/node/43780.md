  body: Thanks... Yes... Very close to URW Garamond No4 or 5 but where are these italic
    swashes coming from...? And downer serifs of italic "p" don't match at all...

  body: URW Garamond Classico is also close but not a good match for text nor italics/swashes...
    Seems very hard to find a match...
