    these numbers.\r\n\r\nHoefler has a series of [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/numbers/styles/|Numbers]]
    fonts based on similar types of numbers, but none are an exact match.\r\n\r\n

  body: "Sometimes called \"crash numbers\" the numbers are used in machines that
    rotate a digit every time the device is used to stamp a number. Note the monospace
    treatment where all numbers more or less fill the width, even the one.\r\nIf you
    are interested in similar letter-forms from a font, consider Prata designed by
    Ivan Petrov for Cyreal [img:sites/default/files/old-images/PrataNumbers_6483.jpg]
    which is available as a Google font http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Prata\r\nDon"
