  I know many of the terms come from the old letterpress days but I also know many
  came from the church, eg font from the font in the church and chapter. Any other
  resources or terms you know that relate back to the church?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: The one that seems to have come from the Church is 'chapel,' which, [[http://www.metaltype.co.uk/stories/story18.shtml|as
    this explains]] is a society or group of compositors. The Oxford Concise Dictionary
    has it as the members of a printers union at a place of work. According to [[http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=11631&d_currency=|this
    book]] the printer's chapel was a precursor of modern trade unions. As printing
    was the first means of mass production, this makes sense...
