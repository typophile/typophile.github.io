  body: "This is a nice use/creation of blank space, however, it seems to me that
    the sound seems to be coming out of the character rather than going to, partly
    because there is only one set of waves. \r\nIt is always worth considering possible
    uses a logo might be put to, for example, a music venue might have clothing and
    other merchandise alongside the main purpose of promoting the venue on posters,
    flyers and online \u2013 and when used on some items it will have to work with
    band/record label/sponsors logos/images, to do this it will need a strong presence,
    and be easy to pick out. To that end it is best to create a logo that works in
    one colour first and then develop it.\r\nTim"

  body: The A is weak and comes out of nowhere compared to the other characters. It
    has no balance. You'd be better off just using an A from the font and making a
    symbol that goes with the type and could stand alone as a symbol. This is forced.
    Get away from the computer grab a marker and some paper and scribble. Then put
    the scribbles down go for a long walk come back and scribble again. Repeat this
    program until you get something that works.

  body: "hey there mr.m. i'd concur with dan. the A to me is a bit clunky. something
    about the height of the horizontals maybe? and the weight of the diagonal? mmmmm.
    p'haps it's the way the A mirrors the N on either side of the E, but not quite?
    I like the little speaker waves idea, but don't be afraid to drop it for a while
    and work on other ideas. The A looks like a radio transmitter which is cool, but
    it's a music venue, not a station right?\r\np.s. what sort of music venue?"

      previous idea/style. I agree with you the A was just not working and the soundwaves
      is just too much like radiowaves.\r\nSo I killed my darling and have been doodling
      away, and suddenly this came through (maybe just a new darling waiting to get
      killed).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.visual-astma.dk/blam4.gif\" target=\"_blank\">result</a>\r\ni
      made an example of how it could be used on a\r\n<a href=\"http://www.visual-astma.dk/cover.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">cover for a program</a>\r\n\r\nI kinda like it, but is it
      too woodstock/70's. I want to make a modern/neutral logo now I am just confused!
      :-)\r\n\r\nBy the way the place mainly plays mainstream rock, pop and folk.\r\n\r\nAny
      comments anyone?\r\n\r\nOh and if there is any doubts about what the name is,
      it is: Skr\xE5en"

  body: What are the 'r' and 'o' doing in there if it's not part of the name? I had
    no idea what it said till I went back to your original logo to only find that
    two of the letters weren't even supposed to be read?

  body: "Morten, I think this has character and presence. It has the required difference
    to stand in competition with other logos. The s and e look tilted which I feel
    is unecessary if that is the case. For the purposes of use and cleanliness the
    outline needs some work to remove some of the nicks and small bumps which are
    a) not going to reproduce at small size use and b) detract from the overall shape.\r\n\r\nDavid,
    I'm afraid you have misread the original logo for the r and the o is a diacritic
    \xE5 frequently used in scandanavian languages.\r\n\r\nTim"

    I would follow cerulean's advice however I would move the a, e & n ever so slightly
    to the right instead so as not to upset the r that's resting on top of the k's
    serif.\r\n\r\n-mmilo"

  body: Its a very pretty graphic but I hope you don't think anyone can read it. Maybe
    it doesn't have to be read, just recognized, like a white person striding for
    go, and a red hand for stop when crossing an avenue.

  body: "I prefer the top one, because it is a simpler form it works better for me,
    the extra white keyline is too much. I think that you will have to amend the keyline
    that enters the lower open counter of the s and the spaces between the sk and
    kr for the smaller use at least. I would also look at a simpler line at the bottom,
    probably only deviating from horizontal in the a.\r\nTim"
