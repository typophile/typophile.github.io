  body: "I looked for 'funny serif' with a straight 'y' and found a couple that were
    not exact, but might be close enough: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typadelic/tweedledee/\">Tweedledee</a>
    from Typadelic; and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/grandma/\">Grandma</a>
    from HVD Fonts.\r\n\r\nIt's possible this is hand-lettering, not a font.\r\n\r\n-
