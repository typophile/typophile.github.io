<div class=commentbody>The angus is one element. And the word Kautz is another. If they are side-by-side as in version 1 and 2, they shouldn't touch ... because the eye wants to see them as "one thing and another thing", not "one thingand another thing" (pardon my English). <br> <br>If they on the other hand are intertwined, it's okay ... but watch out for production difficulties. <br> <br>I think the 'tree' must have to go. <br> <br>Beware that in version 1 and 2 there is too much space around A. <br> <br>In version 3, could you avoid "cropping the angus with a scalpel"? You may have to put the angus in a frame ... I haven't got any solution to this right now ... Maybe version 2 could be realized ... <br> <br>-- <br>Soren O</div>

<div class=commentbody>You might explore creating a medal, like they give out at a county fair. Implying award winning, gold medal that sort of thing. That would be one way of separating the illustration from the type. As its constituted now the look hardly looks premium.</div>

<div class=commentbody>the angus image is a rough illustration in illustrator -- since i am more in the concepting stage, it is pretty rough. although i do want to go with a more abstract, "sketchy" illustration similar to what i've used, i agree it needs some work & clarification. <br> <br>What do you mean, Scott, about the type in #2 flipped to read right?

<div class=commentbody>Sally - I like where you are going - the illustration is better in these second rounds - but I think you may also try something a little more removed from such a literal illustration you run the risk of it looking clip arty. <br> <br>Something with clean lines that would work well in single color - (the merril lynch logo comes to mind for obvious reasons) but what about a hoofprint or something with just the horns cradling the type? <br> <br>I can totally empathize with you - I do design work for a supplier to the dairy industry. Udder dip, mating supplies and bull um... well lets just say essence... and there is so much cow imagry in marketing pieces and ads and so forth that a mark that is distilled down to a quicky symbol may play stronger than a more illustrative approach. Just a thought - <br> <br>having said that so far I like #2, but agree with Scott about flipping the type right side up at the bottom - perhaps also think of using that seal without an enclosure around the type.</div>

<div class=commentbody>i know what you are saying about #2 and #4 -- it resembles a packaging seal, which is why the consumer-end comes to mind. <br> <br>This is a logo more for a Ranch, a Red Angus breeder, than anything to do with the consumer-end. Although the cows bought may be butchered it is much different than buying beef in a grocery store. Does that make sense? <br> <br>Here is another idea . . . I took #1 and modified it a bit . . . should i explore this option more than the seal/stamp look? <br> <br>Thank you for the input! <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41612.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>I like your first designs better. <br> <br>The circle with K and bull on top of each other is far too complicated. It's like your telling two jokes at the same time. Which is better: a drawing of a bull, or a drawing of K defined by the negative spaces? I think the bull. But certainly not both on top of each other. <br> <br>The circle as it is now is not likely to be reproduced in small sizes, let alone in one colour (where the rightmost part of the K would grow out of the shoulder). <br> <br>If you were to balance a circle next to KAUT and the subline, I would place the circle higher, sharing a horizontal axis with only KAUTZ, not with both lines, thus letting the subline 'hang' underneath. <br> <br>-- <br>Soren O</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sally, <br>The logos you have designed look nice, but they do have a food design feel to them and after reading other posts it seems like many of the people think the company sells steaks not livestock. Perhaps you should think more "ranch" than individual "cow". Your design could show a few cows in a field, indicating breeding cow (without going completely graphic) rather than hamburger. Or not even show a cow, a branding iron, rope or fence sign are quick imagery that comes to mind when thinking ranch. Maybe it's something as simple as showing a whole cow to get rid of the food association, the severed head sort of leads one to think of butchery.</div>
