  now and again but as im a bit stuck on my dissertation at the moment i thought i
  would ask if any of you kind people would help.\r\n\r\nIm writing my dissertation
  on Helvetica and its impact from release to modern day and im currently writing
  about the the early days when the Internation Typographic Style cam to use and with
  it helvetica. im struggling for physical examples of its impact on publications
  and mainly corporate idents and visual communication system and was wondering if
  anyone could give me some good examples of pre and post war material from the same
  source. i have plenty of random pieces but neither are from the same original source
  such as Coca Cola. \r\n\r\nim also struggling to find any companies that switched
  from x typeface to helvetica in the 60's\r\n\r\nalso if anyone has any other pointers
  about things i should included in the essay they will be well received as tbh im
  am awful at writing essays.\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: "Taschen did a series of books under the heading \u201CAll-American Ads\u201D
    for every decade from from the 1900s up to the 1980s. They\u2019re cheap and commonly
    found in libraries, so even if your local library doesn\u2019t have them you can
    just use an inter-library loan to get them sent over. Use these books to find
    corporations that went to Helvetica, and from there you can start tracking down
    non-advertising pieces.\r\n\r\nThere are several good books on Vignelli that will
    have a lot of \u201Cafter\u201D images, and for the high-profile identities like
    American Airlines you should be able to track down \u201Cbefore\u201D images with
    help from librarians. You should also contact the Knoll furniture company and
    see if there is somewhere in England that you can look over a collection of their
    identity materials pre and post Vignelli."
