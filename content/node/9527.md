body: Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>I am about to graduate this April and we have a portfolio
  show coming up where people come in from all over the city to see our books. I was
  wondering what people think about icon design, should I put them in my portfolio?
  Or is it something graphic designers don&#39;t usually like to put in because they
  are more illustrative and kind of desktop publishing? My book has corp IDs, ads,
  logos, and the such. The logos that I create are fairly high in detail and more
  realistic approach. I&#39;m just not sure if it would look awkward or unprofessional.
  Any art directors out there or other designers that can give me some direction?

    much a part of graphic desingn &#40;as well as Information Architecture, Human
    Factors, Usability, etc.&#41; <BR> <BR>So, if you like doing icon design, and
    you feel yours are strong, then by all means, show them.

    useful eyeballs on it if it were here in the DESING area.
