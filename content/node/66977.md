body: "Last year when I was uploading a new style to one of my fonts on Myfonts, I
  got an unexpected surprise. The updated font did not show up in the what's new section
  of MyFonts. It came up as usual at the old site. Without any explanation I was told
  simply that updates do not show up in the What's New on the new site. Now, I can
  easily see where less scrupulous designers might take advantage of the old policy.
  On the other hand, it seems somewhat draconian to simply ignore all updates. I assume
  that MyFonts informs clients who have purchased previous versions of updates. That
  does leave a lot of folks out in the cold and in the dark. A friend and I were discussing
  possibly a new section for updates only. Not that Myfonts is necessarily concerned,
  but I like to read other peoples opinions on the new policy.\r\n\r\nOf course, it
  might not bug anyone but me.\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n[[http://thefontry.com/|<em>from

  body: I assume Arial New or Arial Pro would get a mention whereas Arial v2.00 would
    not. If so focus on significant updates that deserve a name change?

  body: 'From what I''ve gathered, if the new style is added to a current type family,
    it is considered an update and not recognized in the What''s New regardless of
    how significant the difference. I made the mistake of adding four new styles to
    my OverKill Bloque family, three of which were very distinctive. Because they
    were added to the existing family they were considered to be updates and were
    not featured in the What''s New on the new site. '

    added.

    affected. It's probably a paranoid delusion on my part....

  body: I noticed and have decided to never again introduce a single font with the
    intension of adding family members later. The only marketing exposure you get
    from MyFonts is in the first 50 days of family introduction. If you are adding
    weights and styles or any significant addition, change the family name enough
    to get a separate listing as Si suggested above (add Pro, New, etc.) or wait until
    your family is finished to post.

    Or do a discount promotion."

  body: 'I updated one font (made corrections to the font and added a small caps version)
    and introduced four new, but related, font families. I was asked to compress them
    all into one family BY John. I mentioned that this would limit my exposure and
    he agreed. At the same time he was still suggesting that it would be for the best
    to put them in one collection. I wasn''t expecting a windfall, but I made zilch
    off the new site - with all sales coming from the old site. '
