body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI made some opentype features on a font (liga, smcp, dnom, tnum,
  zero, numr, ss01, etc.). I generated it (generate font / Opentype PS). When I use
  it in indesign CS4 every features seems to work fine. But when I use it in illustrator
  CS4, and from what I read, the Stylistic set feature is not accessible. Do I need
  to make an aalt feature that repeat my SS01 feature or is it som other way to access
  to the Stylistic sets in illustrator ?"
