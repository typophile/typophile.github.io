  This will need some experiments with different approaches.\r\n\r\nSince my original
  posting, I have been working on the italic. I am aiming for a true italic, with
  little ticks on the bottom right of the relevant glyphs, and different letter shapes
  for a, f, v, w, y, etc. The bowls and arches are a bit more cursive than obliqued
  roman. The rest of the glyphs are just obliqued.\r\n\r\nI have also attached character
  sets for each.\r\n\r\nI wanted to post these in the original thread, but this does
  not seem to work."

    the utf8 page is missing. What is the procedure for posting updates and corrections?
    I do not want to clutter this forum with new postings.\r\n\r\nI have also just
    noticed that the italic is showing signs of its evolution: 'q' has no 'dink' at
    top right, whereas 'a' and 'g' have dinks. I have tried both styles. The current
    style should have dinks everywhere, except on the 'b'. 'Dinkless' is cleaner,
    but tends to make the relevant letter shapes a bit vague, I think. Comments on
    this would be welcome."

  body: "Thanks for all the detailed help, Hrant. Just a few words before I work on
    the stuff you described.\r\n\r\nI agree about the 'U'. The all caps sample really
    shows it up.\r\n \r\nLetter 'a' should indeed have a more space to the right.
    The tail at bottom right takes up some whitespace relative to, say, 'n', so there
    must be a bigger distance to the main stem. The distances to the main stem in
    'a' and 'n' are identical at present. I forgot to adjust the spacing for 'a' after
    adding the tail: it originally did not have a tail.\r\n\r\nI feel the right sidebearing
    of 'i' is less of an issue: I added 26 units to the main stem spacing to compensate
    for the tail. If the right of 'i' is too tight, I would expect 'l' to have to
    same problem,  as the tails are the same. I will try some small variations.\r\n\r\nOn
    the subject of the tail on the 'i' and 'l', I did this partly to provide more
    space around these glyphs, to reduce the \"logjam effect\" that occurs in words
    like \"filling\", which I consider to be a defect of most sans serif fonts compared
    to serif designs. Do you think this works? A more common approach is a left facing
    serif on the top of the stem of the 'i' as well as a tail on 'l', but this produces
    different stem spacing for 'il', 'll', and 'li'. Trebuchet does this. I will try
    some sample text in Clarissa and Trebuchet to compare.\r\n\r\nWith the 'r', I
    am aiming to make the spacing halfway decent without kerning, so the font will
    work in a word processor. Looking at other fonts, the policy seems to be to space
    'r' correctly next to a stem, kern it closer to rounds, and increase the space
    next to 'f' and 't'.\r\nLike the 'i', I think the adjustment I need is small.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I think it is about time for some kerning, so it might be a while until my next
    update."

    this though:\r\nPeople who would use a typesetting app that doesn't support kerning
    (by default) are not the type of people to mind slightly off spacing anyway! So
    you can save yourself a lot of extra kerns by making your base spacing more \"aggressive\".
    This is especially relevant in some non-Latin scripts, where such a technique
    (not minding the occasional touch when the kerning goes unused) can actually save
    you thousands of kerns.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, I think I know what you mean about \"over-crowded fishing boat\",
    but I am just guessing. The ticks on the 'l' and 'i' can pile up, and be distracting,
    much like a sequence of closely-spaced plain verticals. In combination with 't',
    we can really go fishing: e.g. \"little\". So I have just exchanged one distraction
    for another. Having said that, I think my distraction is prettier :-)\r\n\r\nConcerning
    the kerning of 'gj': well, of course! In the spirit of test word nerdism, I searched
    for all occurrences of 'gj' in the American English dictionary that comes with
    the Unix spell checker, ispell. Just three hits: 'logjam', 'jogjakarta', and 'Kwangju'.
    No hits on 'qj'. That's saved me a bit of work.\r\n\r\nBack to serious stuff.\r\n\r\nBy
    'agressive base spacing', I think you mean base spacing that is motivated by making
    kerning easier or better. For a Latin font, this could mean spacing 'r' correctly
    with a round to the right, so we do not need to kern all the accented variants
    of 'ro', 're', etc. There would be less work kerning next to verticals, as there
    are fewer accented variants of such glyphs. My thoughts on this are that a smaller
    kerning table is not much of a benefit in itself. A kerning-aware application
    will work just as well kerning 'ro' and not 'rn' as it would kerning 'rn' and
    not 'ro'. However, a non-kerning application will produce a better output if the
    base spacing is designed to work reasonably well without kerning. So why not add
    a bit to the utility of the font by making it work better in a word processor?\r\n\r\nI
    suppose that reducing the number of kerns could make some improvement in real
    type quality, in that the type designer is less burdened with the drudgery of
    producing excessive kerns, and can concentrate on more important things in the
    design. I get the impression from what you say that this is a real issue in some
    non-Latin scripts. Is it such a problem in Latin fonts? I only have a little experience
    with kerning. I had a go at the basics, with accented variants, using class kerning.
    I stripped it all out, because I was still messing with letter shapes, proportions,
    and spacing.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have rambled on enough, more than likely completely
    missing the point. It is a hot, thundery night in Brum, and I have nothing better
    to do."
