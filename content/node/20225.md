body: Hi all. I would appreciate any suggestions for a sans serif to use on this catalog.
  I've selected Amplitude Wide Bold for headings (which I like), and Proxima Nova
  regular for the product information, but I'm not sure if it's working well or not.
  I've looked at Myriad, Frutiger, and plenty of other sans, and I'm not sure. Also,
  I know it may go against convention, but I like the lining figures. I tried Corpid
  Regular which has old style figures, and it seemed too busy. Maybe I'm overthinking
  this. Any recommendations? Thanks.

  body: "Looks good to me too, the only suggestion I'd make is to have the headings
    either all left aligning or all centred (left aligning would probably be best)
    Inventory and Order could be exceptions to that I presume they are for staff to
    fill in by hand, if you replaced the vertical rules with a tint box behind you
    could also increase the size of the heading type, you could do that without removing
    the rules but it would be less obvious I think.\r\nTim"

  body: Thx Tim. I like the idea of the tint box. The alignment is a good point, I'll
    take a look at that. Still wondering about the actual typeface though. Not sure
    if it's legible enough or not.

  body: "What size is it? You might have a concern on the weight, but unless it's
    smaller than 8pt I think it is legible enough as a further point you might consider
    making the tinted horizontals a touch blacker.\r\nTim"

  body: "Amplitude has multiple condensed variants to choose from, why not use those
    for column heads? You could also massage the column widths; format, year, label
    and artist don't need as much space as they've got. That could offer column heads
    more width as well, so you can use a wider variant. \r\n\r\nNo reason you can't
    use Amplitude everywhere. Do you feel the need to mix 2 sans? "

  body: Thanks for the input. I'm posting an update, I think we're going with FF Din
    Medium for the product info, and Amplitude for the heads. I may do a bit more
    tweaking, but Din seems to be a quick read. I think I did have Amplitude condensed
    for the heads at one point, but for some reason it wasn't working for me for the
    product info. Any other thoughts? Thanks again.

  body: Hi Michael, I like Syntax as well. There was something I really liked about
    FF Din for their numerals. They seemed to be very distinct, and "orderly." I originally
    thought that old style numerals would help legibility, but it seemed that they
    caused too much motion on the page. Thanks again for the input.
