    look at the counter of the \u2018O\u2019!\r\nIf this is a Futura at all it\u2019s
    the worst cut of it I\u2019ve ever seen."

  body: It's the bad old Adobe version, from the first batch of Type 1 fonts they
    released back in the Eighties. It was fixed years ago, but a lot of people never
    upgraded.

  body: That's a good question. I don't know the answer. I just remember that the
    early Adobe fonts were a little uneven. I still have the floppy disks. I got my
    "Futura 2" disk from Linotype through a service bureau. The Linotype and Adobe
    font data was identical, as I recall. I'm sure the tools they used to make those
    early fonts was nothing like what we have now. They probably had to work out the
    outlines on graph paper, type raw PostScript code into a terminal and send it
    to a Laserwriter to see what it looked like, for all I know.

title: Does anybody know this font? It looks like Century Gothic, but not quite the
  same
