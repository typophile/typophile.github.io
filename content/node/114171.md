  body: "They look like real objects to me, not mockups. Note the subtle imperfections,
    wrinkles, etc.\r\n\r\nA quick Google shows it's the original work of a design
    student. He probably took real objects (envelopes, etc), transferred his design
    to them, and then photographed them.  Or he photographed blank objects and then
    added logos in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nhttp://weandthecolor.com/jorgen-grotdal-identity-rebrand/32028"
