  body: Also, could Miguel explain a bit? Which qualities are you looking for? Does
    this go beyond style?

  body: Explanation &#62;  <BR> <BR>When i think about modern tradition &#43; quality
    &#43; functionality i always want more fonts like those 6 on my list. Zapfino
    style like fonts are just a couple if you look for something fine on caligraphy,
    the same with sauna and so on. No clones, but more fonts for that niches in the
    market.. <BR> <BR>It would be interesting to know how kind of fonts can open a
    niche of new possibilities for graphic designers.  <BR> <BR>mh <BR> <BR> <BR>

- body: BJ, <BR>I wasn&#39;t sarcastic,  <BR>I am however curious why people find
    it important to add another set of letters to the world. <BR>Is it because the
    world needs it? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not against it, heck, I even do it myself,  <BR>but
    I do think it&#39;s a valid question for anyone working with typography and type
    design. <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: Fredrik, a typeface designed today reflects on the world as it is today, just
    as art does.  <BR> <BR>&#43; new typefaces are part of an evolution &#40;bigger,
    better, stronger &#40;or weirder&#41;&#41;, just like any other tool, just as
    well as we continue to upgrade photoshop, build bridges and make new receipes.

  body: You mean you think that graphic designers are looking for &#34;new possibilities&#34;?
    <BR> <BR>I occurs to me that most graphic designers are happy following trends,
    and using monoline extended sans types.

  body: Not nessecarily, and maybe not consciously. But new stuff happens all the
    time, slight tweaks on a trend which then, over time, becomes a new trend. <BR>
    <BR>That fact that we have trends is because design evolves. <BR> <BR>You might
    as well ask yourself if we need any new photographs.

    for sale. Not enough nicely idiosyncratic body text types around. <BR> <BR>Good
    enough to eat too, so you don&#39;t have to choose food or fonts.
