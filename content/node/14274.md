  an on-line TV editor. I place type a lot for broadcast TV. Most on-line editors
  think that \"going the extra mile\" with type is adding a drop shadow to your all-caps
  script font and underlining it for emphasis. I'd like to go a step beyond that,
  if you know what I mean. Before you all start throwing rocks at me and saying that
  type on TV is terrible and none of us know what were're doing, here's my question:\r\n\r\nIf
  I want to improve my skills, what books can I read to get the basics of typography
  (short of formal training)?\r\n\r\nI carefully kern my type and try to stay away
  from \"trendy\" fonts, especially for body text. But there's got to be a \"bible\"
  of typography of some sort to make it seem a little less daunting - is there?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPhil"

  body: "Phil, thanks for asking for the opinion of the Typophiliacs; I'm sure that
    you will get many good recommendations. Many of which will be for you to read
    \"The Elements of Typographic Style\" by Robert Bringhurst. Since its publication
    in the early 1990s, this handsome book has become the bible for type lovers. It's
    very well written and easy to read, didactic but not dogmatic, and contains valuable
    insight for readers at all levels of knowledge, from neophyte through veteran.
    I can't priase the book enough.\r\n\r\nEllen Lupton's recent \"Thinking With Type\"
    is a more basic book, and it is very approachable. Ellen is an educator, and this
    book is a de facto text book. There is a great companion website: http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/"

    Working well with type is an undervalued skill in my practice, but I think it
    can be an asset. Type is such a powerful tool.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to reading
    these!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPhil"

  body: At least typography for television has moved beyond the Chyron IV, which was
    state-of-the-art when I was a broadcast television art director over twenty years
    ago. Fonts for the Chyron were all bitmap fonts, and one had to be created for
    each size used, which was a hassle. Sometimes, progress is good...

  body: "Hi Phil,\r\n\r\nJust from the point of view of a viewer (aren't we all),
    my major gripe with text on TV is the tendency to use straight feet-and-inches
    marks instead of \"curly\" quotes and apostrophes. That and using \"(c)\" for
    a copyright symbol. So long as you use the proper characters for each of these,
    that'll be a great start!\r\n\r\nEver since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's
    stopped working.\r\n\u2014dtw"

    though was... color! I made fonts for Broadcast Titler (on the Amiga) and the
    occasional gradation or highlight was highly... fit for TV I guess!\r\n\r\n> one
    had to be created for each size used\r\n\r\nI've come to realize this is inherent
    to the difference between outline fonts and low-res displays. Basically, WYSIWYG
    (I mean at the letterform fidelity level) does not really exist.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the NBC affiliate in Fort Worth-Dallas, and would probably still be there if the

    have changed immensely in the past twenty years. Recently, I got a VIP tour of
    CNN's production facilities in Atlanta, and was blown away by the level of technology

    TV, twenty years of technology is probably too much for an old dog like me to
