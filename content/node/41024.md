  font, when I installed a font for testing it shows strange positioning problems
  as in image Tahree114\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tahreer114_5093.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut
  when I change the zoom size or font size there is no such problem as shown in Tahree150
  below\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Threer150_5441.jpg]\r\n\r\nI am
  using FontLab and MS Volt. \r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAtif"

  body: "Hmm, could it be a hinting problem?\r\n\r\nHave you checked your alignment
    zones and bluescale? Perhaps they are telling some details not to overshoot at
    a specific point size. I dont know arabic but it looks like a detail on the first
    example could infact be there but has been pressed up to the baseline because
    of such hinting instructions."
