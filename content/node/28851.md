    you're leaving this till the hour before it goes to print is puzzling.

  body: Unless your client is Print Magazine, it is probably a pirated copy, of a
    copy, etc. which also explains the corruption of the file. You should consider
    switching to another rounded face... <A HREF="http://processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/index.html">Bryant</A>
    would be one option. <A HREF="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=TB.111758.0.0">Message</A>
    is another.

  body: "wow, you have all been a great help, and it has been much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe
    client is not print magazine, and as it turned out, they do have purchase rights
    to the font Gotham Rounded. \r\n\r\nConsecutively as i was trying to track down
    an uncorrupted version of the font from the client, i phoned up Hoefler & fere
    jones, and asked to purchase the font.\r\n\r\nThen 20 mins later, they had sent
    it to me.. all at a cost of course.\r\n\r\nSo although it was comissioned for
    print magazine they obviously dont have exclusive rights to the font.\r\n\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\n"
