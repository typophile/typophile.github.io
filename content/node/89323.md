body: "I'm doing a conference booklet for an organization whose logo is done in Frutiger
  and a script called Inspiration. I'd like to use Inspiration for certain headings
  and callouts. How does Frutiger work for large amounts of text? If so, what weight...Roman
  or Light?\r\n\r\nIs the Roman heavier than a traditional Book weight? Am I just
  imagining that it looks like it is?"

  body: A lot of factors would play into it, paper, print quality, point size, etc.
    I wouldn't see any reason why Frutiger wouldn't work as long as you take all the
    variables into consideration. It's always good to set some text, and do some test
    prints, I rely too much on the screen sometimes.

    remember Frutiger didn't even advocate it himself, later on. (Disclaimer: Maybe
    it's just a personal dislike of mine.)\r\nIf you're considering a serif you might
    look at Frutiger Serif (which in fact is sort of a remodeled Meridien) which is
    supposed to work extra well with Frutiger. You might do something like having
    the headlines in Frutiger (or that script maybe) and the text in the serif? I
    haven't used it myself though, so can't really utter a recommendation."

    thread</a> we had a while ago and <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/54310?page=1#comment-327595\">found</a>
    Bringhurst in fact recommends pairing Frutiger with Apollo (or Meridien, which
    however he deems less useful for text):\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Frutiger also mated well
    with the same designer's M\xE9ridien and Apollo, though such a mixture was not
    apparently part of the original design plan, and the fonts did not match in weight
    or body size.\" </cite>(Bringhurst, p. 257)\r\n<cite>\"[In making Apollo] Frutiger
    used the opportunity to rethink his first text face, M\xE9ridien, drawn eight
    years earlier. Apollo lacks the sharpness of M\xE9ridien, but its smaller eye,
    blunter serifs and reduced modulation can make it a better choice for text [\u2026]\".</cite>
