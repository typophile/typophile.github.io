body: "I found this on a random free font page as \"BAMBOO.TTF\" (see attachment).
  It's very similar to Castaway. No author info or other details were provided. I
  haven't been able to find it elsewhere under any name containing the word \"bamboo\",
  so it's possible that the filename is misleading.\r\n\r\nI'd like to confirm that
  the font is free, or buy it if not. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time!"

  body: "Mmm... The Castaway\u2019s source seems indeed the same of this one (minus
    the ropes) and whoever did this probably didn\u2019t have a complete specimen
    (not one that contained X anyway). So I think it\u2019s more like an autotrace
    of an old typeface than a rip-off of an existing font.\r\nAnyway, you could ask
    Castaway\u2019s author (http://rotodesign.com/contact.html) about the origin of
    the design.\r\nA similar (albeit in my opinion less vibrant) take on the genre
    would be House Industries\u2019 Tiki Palms (http://www.houseind.com/fonts/tikitype/viewfonts)."

  body: Thanks! So someone presumably digitized or copied the font, added the ropes,
    and released it for free?

  body: "It could be there\u2019s another source (maybe the same from which Dan X.
    Solo reproduced Confucius) already with ropes, but by now I don\u2019t think there
    is a commercial version of it out there (even the Solopedia call it a version
    of Confucius: http://fontek.fateback.com/topical.htm)."
