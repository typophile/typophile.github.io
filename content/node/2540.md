body: hi, <BR>I was wondering if anyone is aware of David Aaker and his suggested
  Brand Identity Traps.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://groups.haas.berkeley.edu/marketing/PAPERS/AAKER/BOOKS/BUILDING/brand_traps.html"
  target="_blank">http://groups.haas.berkeley.edu/marketing/PAPERS/AAKER/BOOKS/BUILDING/brand_traps.html</a>
  <BR> <BR>I am currently writing an essay on the concept of them, and thought it
  may be of use to me to see what other people&#39;s opinions are about them. <BR>
  <BR>thanks x

  body: actually all that sounds like common knowledge. I&#39;m sure it would be at
    least to any marketing student or analyst.  <BR> <BR>All he&#39;s taking about
    are the four P&#39;s  Product, Price, Place, Promotion - and that&#39;s a pretty
    large subject really.  <BR> <BR>Almost everyone and their kid brother has something
    along these lines with which they explain their unique idea about what &#34;branding&#34;
    is.   <BR> <BR>From a design point of view though...what I&#39;d find interesting
    might be to include brand phenomenas and study why they happened.  <BR> <BR>Things
    like kawaii &#40;the cute-a-fying&#41; of every corporation and product in Japan
    no matter what the corporation is or does....just make it cute. <BR> <BR>or Product
    Cartoons - &#40;Smokey the Bear, Pillsbury Doughboy, Ronald McDonald, Mr Clean,
    The Green Giant&#41; and what&#39;s up with deciding you need a character. <BR>
    <BR>or the swoosh-effect or a study on branding to kids and why its awful...Was
    it Sweden that banned any further advertising geared to children?..I forget. <BR>
