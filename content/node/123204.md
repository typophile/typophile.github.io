body: "A thought struck me today; during the era of hot metal type, why is it that
  no one ever invented the following -\r\n\r\nSince the kerns for letters like j and
  Q in some typefaces are very fragile, why couldn't they have been made more durable
  by a strategem like the following:\r\n\r\nIn the area of a type slug below the baseline,
  for characters without descenders, cut a groove into the shoulder of the type, or
  lower the shoulder, so that there is room to put a reinforcing base below kerns.\r\n\r\nOr
  simply make the shoulder lower everywhere, so that the part of the type that is
  in the shape of the particular letter is deeper and hence stronger.\r\n\r\nIn the
  case of letters with descenders that are on only one side of the letter, like p
  and q, the groove or lowering of the shoulder should still be present on the side
  the descender does not occupy."

    shows a kerned Qq in Garamond, with the downwards step in the shoulder on the
    q only going part way across since that letter has a descender."

  body: Nice idea and drawing  it reminds me of traditional Japanese carpentry joints.
    Now put it in a time machine and send it back to when it can do most good.

  body: "I am full of obsolete inventions.\r\n\r\nBack before laser printers, mainframe
    computers used big line printers to produce lots of output on paper quickly. Some
    used a rotating drum, with all the characters provided repeated at each character
    position, with a hammer at each character position forcing the paper and a ribbon
    against the raised character.\r\n\r\nOthers used a means of moving the characters
    across the page, so that only one (or a few, since the width of the page would
    be 132 characters, while usually 64 different characters or less could be printed
    - but in this case, unlike the drum printer, the characters were often spaced
    apart by more than the size of a column on the page) copy of each character would
    be needed.\r\n\r\nOf these printers, some used a flexible band, some used a chain
    of linked slugs with characters, and others used a print train where the hammer
    pushed a slug that could move forwards to the paper.\r\n\r\nIf the hammer hit
    at a slightly wrong time, for a drum paper the line was wavy, with letters displaced
    up and down; for one of these printers, the character would be moved to the right
    or left.\r\n\r\nWell, the thought struck me that this could be exploited, and
    a line printer could be made (with extra-wide hammers that would have to be able
    to be displaced horizontally into more than one position) that could do proportional
    spacing. Perhaps only crudely, like an IBM Executive typewriter.\r\n\r\nAnd as
    it happened, IBM made a line printer that moved the characters horizontally, but
    which used a solid bar with the characters rather than a band or belt or train.\r\n\r\nThat
    gave me the idea of using a print drum that moved horizontally to present each
    character to each print position for printing, and which rotated to make a different
    character set available.\r\n\r\nAn impact line printer that could print in Chinese?
    Along with doing, say, four-line mathematics?"

  body: "I guess before letterpress became a more revered form of art, foundries were
    just too lazy or didn\u2019t want to spend more time and energy producing kerned
    type. I\u2019ve seen wood type being kerned by saws, but rarely with metal text
    faces. I\u2019ve seen metal initials being kerned though.\r\n\r\nOr you could
    cast the letterform out of the face. ATF Garamont I worked with has its italic
    /f letterform protrude out of the rectangular face. That\u2019s extra annoyance
    in the composing stick because you have to carefully sneak other letters under,
    but the /f is definitely kerned more in."

  body: "@quadibloc - \"I am full of obsolete inventions.\"\r\nTell me about it. I
    spent years developing a perspective-drawing machine, just when the PC started
    becoming popular and could draw such scenes. In other cases I would get an idea,
    jot a few pages of notes and go to the next thing. One such idea of 1983 was for
    super-resolved microscopy using time-resolved florescence. The idea, but not me,
    got the 2014 Nobel prize in chemistry!  \r\n\r\nAs to protruding letters these
    days most modern Arabic fonts redesign the ra \u0631 to descend vertically downwards
    and not cause trouble conflicting with the next letter \u0631\u064A\u0627 I had
    to spend months learning how to use OT features to adjust the dots of the next
    letter but did not change the ra shape."

  body: "Your pictures mostly show conventional kerned type, except in the case of
    the capital TA, were we see mortised type.\r\n\r\nI'm saying that conventional
    kerned type was recognized historically as being awfully fragile.\r\n\r\nOne way
    to deal with it would be simply to make the \"letter\" part of the type deeper,
    and the \"block\" part of the type shallower - that wouldn't change the nature
    of the kern, only the proportions of the type body, but it would make the kern
    tougher.\r\n\r\nYes, though, the \"letter\" still does have a bit of a base on
    it that's above shoulder height. But I'm suggesting drastically thickening that
    base and lowering that shoulder."

  body: "I see what you mean. I should have read more carefully.\r\n\r\nJust speculation,
    but could these mortised bodies be a bit awkward in the sense that they might
    need to be cast to fit specific letter combinations? The size and shape of the
    notch needed for, say, a <em>TA</em> might be different from  a <em>T\u2014</em>.
    In other words, it might be just as efficient and less troublesome to cast these
    particular pairings into a single body (a ligature, of sorts, I suppose).\r\n\r\nAlso
    since kerns were mostly reserved for display sizes where even spacing throughout
    the line of type would be most noticeable, slug bodies that fit together a bit
    like jigsaw puzzle pieces might not work with the usual quad spacers.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    though, just speculation. I really have no idea."

  body: Well, just as the type would have to be modified, so would the quads and spaces
    - they would have to be shortened, to only reach to the level of the troughs that
    make room for kerns.
