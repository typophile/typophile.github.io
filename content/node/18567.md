  body: I believe H is for headlines and B is for body copy, while SH & SB are the
    same faces from Scangraphic. Someone else will need to confirm.

  body: "From <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?mid=22\">Scangraphic</a>'s
    blurb at FontShop.com:\r\n\r\n\"Scangraphic offers an extensive range of fonts,
    all available in two special Scangraphic design formats called \u201CBodytext\u201D
    and \u201CHeadline\u201D.\r\n\r\nScangraphic Bodytext (\u201CSB\u201D) faces are
    ideal for text in small point sizes. The hairlines and serifs of the Bodytext
    faces are thicker than normal hairlines and serifs to make them more legible in
    fine print. In addition to this, they have a special ink-traps incorporated in
    the font design to prevent blurring and loss of print quality.\r\n\r\nThe Scangraphic
    Headline (\u201CSH\u201D) faces are made for text in large point sizes. Scangraphic
    optimized the Headline fonts specifically for this purpose, for example, by narrowing
    the spacing of the fonts and re-designing the umlauts in order to make them work
    better aesthetically with the overall design.\""

  body: The number of typefaces Scangraphic offers in body and headline cuts is pretty
    special. They certainly aren't completely redrawn Adobe-style optical cuts by
    any measure, but it's great to have the option for nearly every face in their
    library.

  body: "The Headline version is spaced considerably tighter than the Bodytext version.
    The Bodytext version has ink traps, and the brochure says that its \"terminal
    strokes have been slightly accentuated\". I'm not sure it this is still so, the
    big Scangraphic type overview shows differently positioned/sized guillemets, !?\xA1\xBF,
    parentheses, brackets, percent & perthousand signs for Bodytext and Headline (earlier
    called \"Bodytype\" and \"Supertype\").\r\nThe typeface was digitized with Ikarus,
    was drawn before, and is based on writing.\r\n(The ultra/ultra italic is one of
    the funniest fat faces I know.)"

    Besides just tighter spacing I mean.

    digital releases: from E+F and from Scangraphic. Both versions come from the same
    Ikarus data but were converted into PostScript using different tools, and have
    received different spacing and kerning. I have recently checked both versions
    -- IMO, the kerning of the E+F versions is better than that from Scangraphic.

    Scangraphic and Volker K\xFCster get their due percentages. \r\n\r\nI'd be thrilled
    to see E+F prepare a \"Pro\" version of Today Sans. In fact, I recently turned
    two styles of Today Sans into a \"Pro\" font for my own purpose and used it to
    typeset a little document in Polish. I paired it with Matthew Carter's Fenway.
    The document is nothing spectacular, really, but I think both typefaces works
    quite well together:  \r\nhttp://www.twardoch.com/download/edupl_pierwszekrokitypetool.pdf\r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks everyone. Typophile forums are awesome.\r\n\r\nStephen, you mentioned
    Adobe: <cite>They certainly aren\u2019t completely redrawn Adobe-style optical
    cuts by any measure[....]</cite>\r\n\r\nIn researching the aforementioned versions
    of Today, I also came across the <a href=\"http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/cronos.html\">Today
    Sans - Adobe Cronos story</a>. I don't have any of these faces to experiment with
    (and examples online don't help), so I can't decide on much, but the Adobe faces
    I own have served me well. I'm faced with the ethical question of whether or not
    to use Cronos. Should I buy from a company whose type I trust to be complete,
    or should I expend more effort (and pester more typophiles for answers) to research
    slightly different versions of Today from unfamiliar foundries?\r\n\r\nI think
    it would be an injustice to dishonor K\xFCster by purchasing Cronos, but I have
    reason to assume that Cronos would be a wiser investment. A good part of the project
    I would purchase for deals with on-screen use, and the Adobe faces I've dealt
    with have worked very well on-screen.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an opinion about
    the on-screen anti-aliasing of Today (any version) or Cronos?\r\n\r\nAdam, you
    mentioned that: <cite>[...] the kerning of the E+F versions is better than that
    from Scangraphic</cite>, and <cite>[...] both the E+F version and the Scangraphic
    version has been mastered in OpenType PS format by Elsner+Flake</cite>. Do you
    have any experience with Adobe Cronos? If so, how does it compare?"

  body: "<cite>... certainly aren\u2019t completely redrawn Adobe-style optical cuts

    for a sans like Today. As said, at least in earlier text and headline versions,
    there *were* differences, like ink traps. (I forgot to mention that the text version's
    italic was wider than the headline version's.) Whether these have been polished
    away in more recent versions however, I don't know.\r\n\r\nIf you are used to
    OT font, then maybe you'll feel more comfortable with Cronos. But still I'd like
    to see a Today Sans Pro.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

    no \"Pro\" Today. But it instantly turned out that it does not work at all --
    Cronos and Today have a completely different flavor. I sent my homemade Today
    Sans to E+F, perhaps they'll find some use for it. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: Today Sans and Cronos have very similar proportions and basic lettershapes,
    such that a page of Today Sans and a page of Cronos will have the same overall
    colour and typographic texture. But the treatment of the detailing is very different,
    and the larger the type size the more obvious the difference in flavour this produces.
    Cronos is softer, Today Sans is more formal. Together, they present an interesting
    example of the degree to which detail treatment contributes to the individual
    character of two typefaces whose basic structure is almost identical.

    an \"H\" has two vertical bars and one horizontal one that connects them? ;) \r\n\r\nPages
    set in Today and Cronos look seriously different, have a different flair. Sure,
    there are common features between those typefaces from the skeleton point of view

    Bethold Walbaum. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    flair' becomes more evident as the type size (and resolution) increases, because
    it is primarily in the details of the stroke terminals. Bauer Bodoni and Berthold
    Walbaum? Not that different, I think. How about Helvetica and Arial? :)"
