  body: I&#39;ve seen a freeware font based on the Hard Rock Cafe&#39;s logo.  I can&#39;t
    find it now, but it looks very similar -- especially the start of the &#34;M&#34;
    in Maui, and the tail of the &#34;m&#34; in com. <BR> <BR>Definitely worth looking
    at.  I&#39;ll dig around and try to find it.

    two M&#39;s look very similar -- the rest is too small to be readily identifiable.
