  wrong in using fonts in my designs.  Here is some of my questions:\r\n\r\n1.) When
  a font author digitizes a font they really like from a fantasy book and they licenses
  it to Internet users.  And I want to use the font for COMMERCIAL use, is it enough
  that I only deal with the \"digital-font-author\" or do I go directly to the \"printed-book-font-author\"??
  \ Or need I contact them both before commercial use could be deployed?"

    font did so with the blessing of the printed book author (illustrator I assume)
    then you only need to talk to the person who digitized the font. \r\n3. Link to
    the digitized font?\r\n"

    read the post again a couple of times and was left in a state of confusion.\r\n\r\nBiffy,
    can you please be very clear about your situation: Where does this font come from?
    Is it already digitised? Is it commercially available? Is it freeware or shareware?"

  body: As long as the lettering is <strong>not</strong> a logotype (protectable by
    copyright) but simply lettering (not protectable by copyright), then you should
    only have to deal with the creator of the electronic version (aka, the font).

  body: "I'd agree with oldnick, but you'd have to trust that the person offering
    the font actually drew it from scratch, and didn't just open up an existing commercial
    version and re-name it. \r\n\r\nAlso think there are benefits in doing some research
    and trying to find a more original/professional version of the font if it exists.
    It will likely be better drawn and have better spacing than a re-digitization
    based on printed samples.\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    MacKay \r\nhttp://fonts.lordkyl.net/\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nThis font was found in a
    book entitled \"Medieval and Renaissance Alphabets\". I converted it to a Windows
    True Type font with the method defined at this site and have made it available
    to the general public. The only string I am attaching is that you please mention
    me as the author of the font if you list it on your site, or you let me know how
    you use the font so I can admire your work!\r\nCopyright Notice: Copyright 1997,
    Flight of the Dragon </cite>\r\n\r\nI've been trying to reach him at his forum
    but he hasn't answered in like 2 months.  Maybe I should try some other method,
    but first I wanted som answers from Typophile before doing that."
