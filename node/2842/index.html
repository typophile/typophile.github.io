  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">OK, so it's my turn. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For over 15 years I've used the name &quot;NEWORLD&quot; (yes, I know others use it too) informally for the multimedia productions/programming that I do. I chose that name because of many reasons, but the one reason that might be usable in logo design is this: &quot;norashkharh&quot; (which translates to &quot;new-world&quot;) is the Armenian name of a fruit that I really love. I've never known its English name, but it looks like a tiny pear with a very thick, fuzzy, dark greenish-brown stem; the body is dark orange, with a thick peel; the seeds are huge, dark brown, and usually in pairs or triples*; the trees have large, thick, dark green leaves. (It's ironic btw that it's originally from the New World, but people here don't seem to harvest them.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Superb ammo for improvised wargames, btw! Just the right heft for pain with no injury. And great aural resonance when dropped onto car roofs (preferably in a fistfull) from a 6th-story apartment&hellip;  :-&gt; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, I never had a [decent] logo, but now some of your guys's design sense has [hopefully] rubbed off onto me, and I feel ready to &quot;congeal&quot; a visual identity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would like to have some melding trick in the &quot;w&quot;, not least as an allusion to the WWW. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the top-left one, I can make it all-caps, or maybe unicase (which might create a good avenue for &quot;w&quot; trickery). If I leave it lc, I could nestle the &quot;software&quot; above it (to the left of the ascending &quot;ld&quot;). I don't think I can make it an intercap -&quot;NeWorld&quot;- decently, and &quot;Neworld&quot; detracts from the &quot;World&quot; part. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the other three, the inside squarish part I'm thinking needs really full, blocky, kinda hard to decipher letters (like in FF Extra) - maybe in reverse field. For the bottom-left one (or maybe the top-right one too), I'm wondering if I could make the &quot;W&quot; into rays*, like a newly rising sun or something - but the &quot;W&quot; would have to remain strongly legible. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* In which case maybe I could set &quot;NEWORLD&quot; in a semi-circle around a sun-disk (or half a disk). Huh, a disks is a good allusions to a CD too&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, the &quot;software&quot; part is really optional. I'd even consider using another word that makes sense (or for the logo just &quot;NEWORLD&quot; maybe). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Advice appreciated&hellip; and needed! I hope the multiplicity of directions I mention above don't derail some totally different -and much better- ideas you guys might dream up. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Brian, no apology necessary at all! I'm really not good at logo design, period.

With the guidance of people here I think I can probably achieve that &quot;internally&quot;. That makes it more personal, not to mention less expensive. If/when I make it big (yeah, right) then I'll spend money in proportion to the relevance of having a good mark. But I'm not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cheap - like I'm considering buying Panoptica if I go with the top-left option. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hector, thanks for the pointers. I guess basically I want people to think I know how to handle the &quot;new world&quot; of media. It's not that new any more I guess, but being an &quot;old hand&quot; at &quot;new media&quot; (since '87) has its advantages. This &quot;old-timer of the new world&quot; aspect I think is conveyed well with Amerind symbology - plus it has a personal dimension, so it would tell people something about me, although very indirectly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; what is so goddamed (did I write this well?) good about you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would like to convey my affinity for innovation and technique. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

However I do think you would feel more confident &amp; satisfied in your choice if you knew what your you meant by those choices. Your pleasure &amp; confidence in your mark could be good for business in &amp; of itself! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I were doing this project I would want to know what you wanted a prospective client to assume about you. Logos are great for suggesting things about their owners/companies.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If your logo was a poem spoken into the unconcious mind of a viewer allowing you to quietly shape his ideas about your company - what would it say? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With the Nike swoosh you get : motion.

What do your competitors logos/identities look like? You should probably avoid anything that looks too much like their logos or which uses similar ideas to avoid any confusion &amp; or any dimishing of your logo. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What about having a no logo identity which work off of graphic standards rather than a mark per se? Or a logo that is a set of variations rather than something static? I have to admit that some of the best work I have seen in the last 10 years seems to be about identity rather than a 'logo'. There are logos in most of the examples I am thinking about but the logo is part of an larger &amp; cohesive whole. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Where the logo will be used - computer screens/web presumably - but where else? Does it need to work at a small size on a TV screen for instance?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you know where it is going to be used that will shape your thinking too. It's quite alot like like when you know a font is going to be used on newsprint- you will avoid obvious problems when designing it or selecting it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A one color design, or a design that works well in one color can save on repro costs too! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">When you say &quot; affinity for innovation and technique&quot; I guess I was thinking of the evocation associations that are less cerebral &amp; more emotional or poetic. Innovation could be bleed out into description like mutable, as opposed to static, variety etc. It could also associate with ideas of dynamicness, shifting - not resting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When you say technique I can't imagine what you couyld mean. I think of skilled maybe but I don't feel confident that thats what you have in mind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About the logo you have going I think you don't need the eye per se. It seems like an afterthought to me - as it is being presented now. I get the idea that you press the button &amp; you get a glowing new world. If thats the idea then maybe it would be good to integrate the two a little more.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I bet the letters could work on their own though! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would loose the button myself. When I look at GUI with buttons I usually don't like it because the metaphor of the physical is almost always wrong somehow. In the case of a logo it's less so but my prejudice remains.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;venting&gt;Buttons are so then&hellip; Also the rise of simple text based blogs &amp; boards like this one &amp; typographi.ca which use simple looking but sophiticated layout are happily showing us that buttons are not needed.&lt;/venting&gt;      <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What about adding some kind of texture or phyical reference to the logo. Like as if it was woven into a basket or cut into pottery - Amerind craftishness embeded at a subliminal level could offer alot of richness.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That actually might refer to your idea of 'technique' via the reference of craft.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alot of what I have enjoyed about your posts is that you seem concerned with legitimate craft as a means to expression as opposed to expression without regard for craft. I am probably putting words in your mouth to some extent &amp; if so sorry about that if I am.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Actually you could have versions of the logo as they would be woven carved or printed using a variety of old style, real world, materials as a basis for a logo with multiple permutations.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hmm  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also would you sell type designs under this brand?

I would like to see some work done to enhance the readability somehow. Seeing the design for the 5th time it seems to vibrate just a little too much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm confused where you stop talking about the triple-u version and where you start talking about the rays one. BTW, I'm surprised that you guys really think the triple-u would be seen as a typo&hellip; You could never even type that!  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the readability (of the rays, I'm assuming), wouldn't you say that I need to strike a balance between looking like rays versus looking like &quot;NEWORLD&quot;?

The annoyance it generates, could it be slight enough to be &quot;a feature and not a bug&quot;? Hard for me to see &quot;from inside&quot;. That and the earlier version with the heavier outside rays give the logo a nice dynamism, a rawness, no? Dunno. I have an aversion to it looking too polished, too static. Do remember this is multimedia work (in terms of movement). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can tell I'm thinking out loud here. Hopefully that'll help me overcome my weaknesses in graphic design&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, I like your thinner and taller rays (I'd just have to negate the skew). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul, interesting ideas - I'll see how far I can take them. I think I could create your combo triple-u/rays thing with positive/negative shapes instead of two colors.

		<div class="commentbody">It might be helpful to think of some icon-images that go along with the idea of new world rather than a horizon line and the sun? How about an old ship, or a compass, or a telescope, or something with longitude and latitude lines, or a sail. Could you get the w to look like a ship without being cheesy? Just some quick thoughts. Maybe start looking at old maps?
