body: "We have purchased a font to use in InDesign CS4 and Word 2003 and 2007.\r\nThe
  font is Truetype and doesn't include specially made superscript-characters. \r\n\r\nWord
  has has the option to set font manually to a different styles like Italic, Bold,
  Smallcaps and Superscript. The problem is that Superscript doesn't work in fontsizes
  7 / 7,5 / 9 / 9,5.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions how to solve it or what could be the problem?
  The font itself is okay, and Word works okay in rendering every other font that
  I use.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I could just reproduce that bug with Word 2003 for Windows at exactly the
    font sizes you named (7 / 7,5 / 9 / 9,5), with a font I compiled in Fontographer.
    I'll do some checks on the font and come back to this later.

  body: "Ok, I could mend it by changing the values of ySuperscript XSize and YSize
    in the OS/2 Positions table, which were very low (at ca. 20% of the Em Square).\r\nIt
    seems that Word (at certain font sizes?) looks at these values and uses them when
    they are lower than its own built-in reduction ratios for extrapolated superscripts.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems that hardly any fontmaker cares about these values since they seem to be
    ignored by modern software - but apparently not by all and under all circumstances.\r\n\r\nPlease
    contact your font vendor if you cannot - or aren't allowed to - fix that yourself.
    \r\n\r\nAndreas"
