		<div class="commentbody">Hi Tiffany. <BR>Version.1-The Zoraster character has to be part of it and I was not allowed to simplify it/ or re-render it as vector.  <BR>Version.2-I think you have a point about the lines. I took them from other comps (not shown), but I think you are right-not needed. Background is dark brown not black (perhaps poor color compression for web post). A redish tone brown would properly be even nicer. Thanks for the critique.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Futher explanation and responses to posts. <BR>Arya wanted to modernise and synchronize their identity witout modifying the Zoraster icon they already use. As I discovered once I got started was that the sacred geometry and symbology associated with the character could not be modified, as there was a reason for everything in it. Although I would have liked to re-render it in vector for userbility and refinement I was discouraged to do so by client.  <BR> <BR>The comps shown were really my first attempt at this to show client some direction. I banged this out the same night after our initial brief 10 minute meeting.  <BR>The next day when we had a real meetiung scheduled I was surprised to discover client liked it all as is (top version).  <BR>In some strange way disappointing as I like many other typophiles really enjoy the refinement aspect of a project like this. <BR> <BR>One issue is that we are doing mostly trade, and what was not determined was $ exchange in our short 10 min. meeting. I trust this client because of the referral, so I went ahead with comps as shown. <BR>So what now? Well I have approval and exchange negotiated, so I will continue with content. <BR> <BR>I agree the &quot;A&quot;s aret not perfect (btw I enjoyed your comment about heavy metal Marius-I can see where you how you see the associated, at least if the type is isolated).  <BR>Black is to stark-&quot; It always expresses suffering and struggle&quot; I don't agree, Pirates always seemed to be having a good time-just kidding, anyway in final version they will be a warm dark reddish black/maroon. <BR> <BR>About spot color on &quot;Guide&quot; - just a comp to show client what we could use. It will be solid-thanks Chase a good observation. <BR>I does lokk a bit off. <BR> <BR>A word of advice. Trades can be nice but be careful-it is not a good practise to get in the habit of doing so, especially if you have a sales rep.</div>
