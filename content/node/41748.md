body: "I'm working on a visual project for school and I've been searching for a certain
  kind of font. It kind of has the looks of the Rolling Stone magazine logo, but with
  a \"Times New Roman\" or \"Garamond\" twist. I think it was popular during the late
  70s/early 80s in advertisements. I've tried to find a picture, but I can't seem
  to find even that.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows what I'm talking about and could provide
  a link to a (preferrably free) version of the font, it would be greatly appreciated.
