    he gave a lecture, Tschichold - the old Tschichold, as well as the new Tschichold
    - always said on the invitation card: 'no discussion afterwards'.\"  \r\n\r\nThe
    interesting thing about Tschichold is that his extreme dogmatism did not prevent
    him from doing brilliant work, nor from changing his mind. It just made him on

    instead of just the eyes, which slows down the process.  "

    rule-based presumptuousness from Noordzij's (or anybody else's) perspective. \r\n\r\nTake
    for example this sentence: \"There are wayward details in some letters: the shortened
    bar in f, the inadequate ear on r, the cropped head of a...\" What is the <em>basis</em>
    for asserting that an r's ear is inadequate\u2014an unspoken law? an obnoxious

  body: ">basis for judging those details are largely a matter of aesthetic taste,
    but practical rules set the boundaries \r\n\r\nAs you say there are two factors:
    One is aesthetics. The other is the set constraints put on by our perceptual apparatus
    as to what is more readable. This is a matter of physiology and psychology, and
    includes things like line length. Actually, I think that details can also affect
    readability, so text type can be critiqued from that point of view.   \r\n\r\nGerrit
    Noordzij claims in this essay that if \"If we ask for the intentions of the type
    designers, we find that their work reflected their attitude to writing with little
    regard for previous solutions.\" \r\n\r\nI think this very wide of the mark. After
    Jenson, all type designers that I know of were very influenced by previous *type*
    designs. Griffo had and worked with Jenson's type IIRC, and his efforts take Jenson's
    ideas and push them in a more typographic direction, for example, *not* a direction
    more influenced by writing. \r\n\r\nCaslon was directly interpreting Dutch typeface
    models in his own way. And that Baskerville was heavily influenced by Caslon's
    work, as well as by the steel pen. In turn Bodoni and Didot were influenced by
    what Baskerville did, not only the pen. And today an original work like Scala
    I don't think was influenced by changes in writing, but by other concerns relating
    to digital production, and the need for sans and serif designs that go together.

    a lot more time looking at contemporary manuscript books, and Griffo's innovations
    are pretty minor and well within the influence of the formal humanist book hand.
    Between Jenson and Griffo, not a lot happens in terms of that book hand, so we
    should not expect any significant evolution in type styles. As typographers, we
    have established a history in which something like making the bar of the lowercase
    e horizontal instead of slanted is suddenly significant, but in the overall context
    of renaissance text manufacture -- both chirographic and typographic -- it is
    not significant at all. Griffo's types, like Jensons, are thoroughly wedded to
    the humanist book hand.\r\n\r\nWhat Noordzij has drawn our attention to is the
    phenomenon of very significant changes in type styles over the following centuries
    that correspond to and trail changes in writing. There is a tendency to think
    of a pre-Gutenberg scribal culture and a post-Gutenberg print culture, a kind
    of revolutionary media rupture of the kind that excites modern cultural theorists.
    But the fact is that the scribal culture persisted in various ways well into the
    19th century, until the invention of mechanical typesetting, and in some areas
    of life until the popularisation of the typewriter. The production of manuscript
    books gradually dwindled to almost nothing in the 150 or so years after Gutenberg,
    but formal writing continued to be the means of producing many other kinds of
    documents, and it continued to provide the aesthetic and cultural context for
    the design of new typefaces. This does not imply that typographic letterforms
    simple copied written letterforms: obviously they did not. But they did import
    the characteristics of the popular written forms, most notably in stroke contrast
    and axis, i.e. the two characteristics by which we most often classify types.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    your final points, of course designers of type are responding to other types as
    well as to writing, but for most of the history of type they have been doing so
    in a context in which a large amount of the text that readers encounter everyday
    is written by hand. Writing is more dynamic than type, so evolves more quickly
    and shows more immediately changes in tools and taste. \r\n\r\nI really don't
    see any influence of Caslon in Baskerville's types. Baskerville is responding
    to neo-classicism and looking for a form that reflects the aesthetics of his culture.
    His models are not writing directly, but the increasingly important engraved image
    of writing, which itself is importing characteristics from writing as informed
    by the larger movement in architecture and art. These forms are a hybrid of written
    and constructed forms. In Bodoni's case, the direct influence of writing is explicitly
    acknowledged. Most of the 'history' of type design has been written without reference
    to a larger business of manufacturing texts, and so presents a purely typographical
    narrative in which the only possible influence on the development of new types
    is old types, or occasionally inscriptional lettering. This leads to fantastical
    notions such as the 'Transitional' classification of type, as if Baskerville were
    somehow anticipating Bodoni and designing his own as an interpolation between
    the 'Oldstyle' and the as-yet-non-existent 'Modern'.\r\n\r\n<em>And today an original
    work like Scala I don\u2019t think was influenced by changes in writing, but by
    other concerns relating to digital production, and the need for sans and serif
    designs that go together.</em>\r\n\r\nToday, all bets are off on the influence
    of writing because there simply isn't any. Formal writing in the west is dead,
    and I don't consider 'calligraphers' significant. Calligraphers produce calligraphy,
    not texts. Type design has therefore lost its historical context. This isn't necessarily
    a bad thing, in terms of what may be produced as we look for new contexts to respond
    to and new paradigms for typography, but I think it makes it all the more important
    to understand that historical context and the relationship that has existed between
    writing and type in periods and places where formal writing and a scribal culture
    persisted alongside typography. Apart from anything else, it will make us sensitive
    to the perceptions of typography in those few places in the world where a scribal
    culture still exists and still influences taste and opinion of typographic forms."

    A scientific law is by its nature disprovable. It is taken to be true until disproved,

    the most refreshing statement I have heard in 13 years in type design was something
    Peter Bi\u013Eak said during his presentation at TypeCon in Minneapolis: he explicitly
    rejected the view of 'design as problem solving' and suggested instead a view
    of 'design as a kind of reading'. And he showed a short film he had made imposing
    punctuation on a cityscape seen from a moving train, to make clear that what he
    was reading, as a designer, was the world around him. This is very much where
    my 'affections' -- to use Noordzij's term -- lie, with design as a process of
    engagement and response, understanding and interpretation. Within this process
    there is definitely a place for laws, i.e. for analytical formulations that enable
    a critical engagement.\r\n\r\nMost design is banal and predictable precisely because

    so true, not only of design students; the majority of practising designers seem
    almost terrified of taking risks. Realistic practitioners accept that there can
    be no art or new design without risk. \r\n\r\n\"Freedom is a scary thing. Not
    many people really want it\" ---from the song Statue of Liberty, on Laurie Anderson's
    recent album Life on a String.\r\n\r\n<em>The body of science is that which can
    not be disproven.</em>\r\n\r\nThe body of science is that which is destined to
    be disproven. The whole history of science is a succession of theories or laws
    disproven by experiment and observation, and supplanted by new theories which
    in turn are disproven and replaced by subsequent laws or theories, on and on.\r\n\r\nThe
    Day the Universe Changed, by Professor Sir James Burke, narrates this history
    of science and scientific revolution with immense clarity and insight. Nothing
    is what it seems. Not even laws are what we think they are. Each view attained
    by each phase of culture and society is just another view---a reading of the world
    that attempts to make sense of it.\r\n\r\nSome psychologists view human consciousness
    as a kind of dreaming, in the sense that we dream in an illusory fashion in order
    to percieve the world around is.\r\n\r\n<em>Most design is banal and predictable
    precisely because it is undertaken as problem solving.</em>\r\n\r\nI couldn't
    agree more John.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    precise sense that Noordzij uses the term, there are only exceptions to rules.
    Something that disproves a law \u2014 i.e. the circumstance that renders a law
    false \u2014, is not an exception, it is the basis on which you reformulate the
    law so that it is no longer false.\"</cite>\r\nwhich hits the mark. Noordzij's
    notion of Law is very close to the Peirceian notion of law/thirdness. (Also: Dewey,
    Fleck, Popper, & al.) Very nice.\r\n\r\nAs to dogmatism:\r\nI think in the bigger
    picture, it of no relevance whether an author is dogmatic (Tschichold) or self-critical
    and open for discussion (Noordzij). Both may, or may not, provoke discussion nevertheless.
    If Tschichold does not criticise himself, others will do it for him.\r\nScience
    / scientific attitude is more than questioning one's own beliefs. So it is not
    required that an author be self-critical, or not be a dogmatist. It seems that
    in science, quite many participants are rather dogmatic. What makes this business
    \"democratic\" is that there are many many of them, who try to support their own
    points of view and falsify the other ones'. This ensures criticism or reflexion
    on the level of community rather than of the individual.\r\nIt would have been
    interesting to compare Tschichold and Renner in this respect, the former representing
    Rules, the latter Laws. And, what does it mean that Tschichold is popular to day
    while Renner's writings on typography were almost forgotten, \"rediscovered\"
    only in recent years? Which turns attention toward ...\r\n\r\n\"The role of the
    reader\"\r\nThe \"problem\" possibly is not authors but readers/followers. <cite>Even
    if</cite> Tschichold himself was a typographic dictator, one may still read him
    with a smile and ask for his motivation, for the paths which led him to his conclusions
    or beliefs in this or that. (At least that's how I read any text.) Amusingly,
    Mr Noordzij who, in my reading, keeps an ironic distance to his own writings seems
    to have followers who read him the dogmatic way. Maybe not so much as regards
    the theories but more in terms of \"applied interpretation\" -- I think of the
    existence of so many \"The Hague style\" typefaces, from within the school and
    outside. Sometimes it is hard to figure out whether this or that typeface is the
    result of \"dialog\" with (or re-interpretation of) the The Hague understanding
    of type design, or a mere imitation of the tangible results of this understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)\r\n"

    thru.</em>\r\n\r\nIt doesn't bother me at first read, but I do like to read old
    stuff. I don't think it would have concerned readers at the time. \r\nOn analysis,
    it becomes apparent that the typographer has opened out the word spacing in the
    first paragraph, and amply spaced the \"ellipsis\", to enable that paragraph to
    be squared off without leaving too big hole in front of E. Keble Chatterton. What
    would you have done to maintain the squared-off style, Steve? Bear in mind that
    in those days (the 1930s) raggedness was bad grooming, and more objectionable
    than big word spacing.\r\n\r\nIn general, the consensus on appropriate word spacing
    today is that it should be a lot tighter than it was in the past. I would say
    that greater flexibility and control of kerning and H&J parameters enables this
    effect, and there is also a greater incidence of rag right copy, which has less
    wordspace overall than comparable justified text. \r\n\r\nConsider the beginning
    of sentences. With sentences in English often beginning with the letter T, Y,
    or W, when there was no kerning for a following lower case letter, a narrow preceeding
    wordspace positioned the Intial in the middle of a fair amount of white space,
    too close to the end of the previous sentence. The solution to this design problem
    was to have a larger space between sentences -- but in order to not have this
    stand out too much, the normal word space was larger. An airier look altogether.
    \r\n\r\nI believe that had the same \"readership efficiency\" test of acceptable
    word spacing been conducted then and now, the results would be different. People
    are more comfortable with what they're used to. Any laws of perceptual processing
    must be culturally specific: place, time, demographics."

    status it should, according to Popper, be *potentially* refutable. That is, they
    should exclude some events about which we can actually check whether they happen
    or have happened under the specified conditions. \r\n\r\nFor example the simple
    claim 'birth stars influence character' is not refutable, and so not scientific.
    (It may be true--or not--but that's another issue.) The claim that normal human
    conception involves an egg and a sperm is testable. You can look with a microscope
    and see whether the little creatures are there, and indeed they are. \r\n\r\nFor
    a theory to be testable is not only a matter of logical form. Scientists also
    have to want to check by observation and experiment, and not try to weasel out
    of refutation by equivocation about meaning of terms, etc. As Karsten notes, Popper
    emphasized that the this process is a feature of science as a social institution,
    not just the attitude of a particular researcher. \r\n\r\nNick and John, strictly
    speaking Newton's law of gravitation has been refuted. That's what Eddington's
    1921 observation of a solar eclipse was about, testing Einstein vs Newton. Of
    course Newton's laws are approximately true and good enough in most circumstances.
    But that's not good enough. Einstein's theory  survived those tests better than
    Newton's.   \r\n\r\n2. Noordzij's use of the terms 'law' and 'rule' is a little
    idiosyncratic, but his point I thought was pretty clear, and sound: conjecturing
    scientific laws of perception in reading is a healthy open-minded process, whereas
    demanding conformity to rules based simply on one's own authority is pretty ridiculous,
    however accomplished the person. \r\n\r\n3. Nick, the laws of human perception
    do limit print legibility. Print black on black and it's hard to read because
    of low contrast. Print it at 3 point, and people will have an extremely hard time
    reading it because of size. Now such issues as spacing the science is much more
    complicated and confused. But that's because the science is not that good yet,
    not because scientific results are in principle irrelevant.\r\n\r\n4. On the influence
    of changes in writing technology and practice on type design. Noordzij's theory
    is very interesting, and may indeed be one influence. \r\n\r\nBut here Noordzij
    starts sounding like Tschichold, and makes his theory the one and only influence,
    which I think is absurd. To repeat, Noordzij wrote; \"If we ask for the intentions
    of the type designers, we find that their work reflected their attitude to writing
    with little regard for previous solutions.\u201D\r\n\r\nThat type designers weren't
    looking at previous type and influenced by it is to me a ridiculous theory.   \r\n\r\nLet
    me start with my idea that Baskerville had studied Caslon carefully and was heavily
    influenced by his *type*. You say: \"I really don\u2019t see any influence of
    Caslon in Baskerville\u2019s types.\"\r\n\r\nOk, here's what Baskerville said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr.
    Caslon is an Artist, to whom the Republic of Learning has great obligations; his
    ingenuity has left a fairer copy <em>for my emulation</em> than any other master.
    In his great variety of Characters I intend not to follow him, the Roman and Italic
    are all that I have hitherto attempted; if in these he has left room for improvement,
    it is probably more owing to that variety which divided his attention, than to
    any other cause.\" \r\n\r\nThat as quoted by Alexander Lawson, Anatomy of a Typeface,
    p. 187, my emphasis. \r\n\r\nNow that sounds to me like a type designer. It is
    well aware of what the previous generation did, and takes that as his point of
    departure. He also puts in a dig that Caslon was sloppy because he turned out
    so much work (true). Baskerville changed a lot about Caslon, but for sure he was
    looking at *type* and not writing only.  \r\n\r\nI will discuss writing vs type
    further another time, and answer Peter's question, but this post is long already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    should be at least partly agents of change, and respond to change. \r\n\r\nOttmar
    Mergenthaler developed a system of justification in the early 20th century, which
    inserted extra spacing between characters as well as words (which is what Quark
    etc made something of a standard from around 1990). But at the time, everyone
    thought it looked horrible, so Linotype stuck with justification only using word
    spaces. This is one more reason that leads me to conclude that our physiological
    apparatus can handle all kinds of different spacing models, and it is cultural
    and technological contingencies which determine which are more effective, not
    biology. So the science of reading is more of a social science, further from engineering.\r\n"

  body: "Bill, I think Baskerville was being polite to his highly respected countryman
    and his celebrated types, presenting his own work as if it were an 'emulation'.
    This isn't an entirely uncommon phenomenon: an innovator courting acceptance for
    his work by downplaying its innovativeness. Remember, innovation has only recently
    been seen as an entirely positive thing, and we know that Baskerville had trouble
    getting his types accepted by conservative readers who knew-what-they-liked-and-they-liked-Caslon-thank-you-very-much.\r\n\r\nIf
    you actually look at the types you have to acknowledge that Baskerville is doing
    something very different. The change from an oblique to a vertical axis alone
    is a radical difference (one that prompts every type classification scheme I'm
    aware of to put Caslon's types and Baskerville's in separate categories). The
    change in contrast, weight and proportions are also significant. And these changes
    are all mirrored in contemporary developments in formal writing brought about
    by the increasing use of the split nib. Baskerville's genius was to take the stroke
    logic of written and engraved lettering, which was most often oblique, and apply
    it to roman forms.\r\n\r\nBaskerville's Greek type is also worth looking at in
    this regard, I think: this is not a typeface designed by a man who cared what
    anyone else had done before him. It is weird and probably must be considered a
    failure, but it owes nothing to Caslon or any other type designer. Baskerville
    may have felt some need to publicly claim that he was a humble follower in Caslon's
    footsteps, but the work tells a different story. Baskerville was an unconventional
    man (he lived with a woman who was not his wife for many years at a time when
    this was seriously scandalous), and I doubt if he had any illusion that he was
    not, in fact, the finest printer England had every produced.\r\n\r\nBut none of
    this is to suggest that type designers have not been influenced by other type
    designers, and I don't think Noordzij is suggesting this either. What I am saying,
    at least, is that such influence takes place within a wider context of text creation
    that is only partially, if increasingly, typographic, and it is developments in
    this wider context that produce radical changes in the styles of type. In an important
    sense, I would say it doesn't matter whether a particular type designer of the
    past was more influenced by writing or by type, because what he was actually influenced
    by was a text culture within which writing and typography were not as compartmentalised
    as we have come to think of them."

    by other type designers, and I don\u2019t think Noordzij is suggesting this either.\r\n\r\nJohn,
    it seems to me you are dismissing compelling evidence. \r\n\r\nI'll repeat the
    Noordzij quote a third time, and perhaps you can explain how I am misinterpreting
    it:\r\n\r\n\u201CIf we ask for the intentions of the type designers, we find that
    their work reflected their attitude to writing with little regard for previous
    solutions.\u201D\r\n\r\nBy \"previous solutions\" he means, as I read him, the
    designs of other type designers. That is what I am reacting against. And by the
    way Noordzij is on occasion given to extreme, interesting, thought-provoking statements,
    so this is quite in character. \r\n\r\nLet us go with the case of Baskerville
    further. I do not find your dismissal of Baskerville's explicit statement of debt
    to Caslon convincing. There are a hundred ways he could have praised his predecessor
    without directly saying he emulated him, but he didn't choose any of those hundred.
    So why would he feel compelled to lie outright, which he has to be doing for Noordzij
    to be right? \r\n\r\nAlso, I have been working on history of ideas in one way
    and another for a long time, and I have found that what an innovator says about
    his or her predecessors is extremely revealing, and is worth paying careful attention
    to. These statements are usually very brief, and as a rule more accurate and revealing
    than anything else that has been written since. \r\n\r\nIn Baskerville's case,
    I think that only one of a number of changes he made to Caslon is directly attributable
    to writing. \r\n\r\nAgain, more of what Baskerville actually said:\r\n\r\n\"I
    formed to my self ideas of greater accuracy than had yet appeared, and have endeavored
    to produce a Set of Types according to what I conceived to be their true proportions.\"\r\n\r\nLet
    us take 'proportions' first. As you note, handwriting is generally oblique. And
    it tends to narrower n's h's etc. than roman letters. And the counters in the
    o, n, m, etc are more assymetrical with the outsides. And this remains true in
    18th century writing, such as that of Bickham. I don't know if Bickham has wider
    arches than earlier scripts, but if so it would be influenced by neo-classical
    taste, rather than any result of the mechanics of the pen or of writing.\r\n\r\nBaskerville's
    nm etc have lovely neo-classical arches, and to achieve these are wider than previous
    letters, and the arches are more symmetrical and circular than earlier types.
    The vertical stress of Baskerville takes what Caslon (and earlier the Dutch) had
    done with the O and o, and apply it across the board. All of these features *contradict*
    writing, and are more likely influenced by neo-classical architecture and other
    design than by 18th century writing in particular. \r\n\r\nAs to 'accuracy', if
    you look at Caslon's original types, you see that in some sizes eg the m's and
    n's have quite different curves, and there is a lot of variation in x height,
    ascender height, stem width etc. And the relative proportions of letters sometimes
    vary greatly from size to size. So Baskerville set out in reaction against Caslon
    to have strict consistency in these matters. But again, this is not a feature
    of writing. The extreme consistency and accuracy is not possible or even desirable
    in writing, but it is in type. \r\n\r\nBaskerville it seems to me was influenced
    by Caslon as much by reaction against him as in following him. But that makes
    it no less an influence: he was looking at *type*, contrary to Noordzij. I haven't
    made a comparative study of the two types, but my impression is that there remain
    some similarities in structure. The x-heights and extenders are, IIRC, similar
    in proportion. And the way the diagonal letters are handled (formation of k, W,
    M) is similar. And the caps are fairly heavy in relation to the lower case. They
    are somewhat less than Caslon, but much more than eg. Garamond, showing the enduring
    influence of Caslon.   \r\n\r\nAnd by reaction, Baskerville gives the letters
    greater contrast, more vertical stress, and wider and more symmetrical letters.
    The high contrast is the one thing in this that is likely an influence of the
    steel pen, but that's about it. \r\n\r\nAgain I have gotten long, so more later... "

    type designers, we find that their work reflected their attitude to writing with
    little regard for previous solutions.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nThis seems to me a confused
    statement, because it starts off asking about intentions and ends up talking about
    what their work reflects. I'm not into guessing intentions, but I am interested
    in what one can deduce from looking at the product. Maybe, in intention, Baskerville
    really did think of himself as emulating Caslon, although it seems unlikely to
    me given his otherwise innovative genius. But I have a number of books printed
    by Baskerville in his own types, and they are clearly something distinct from
    what preceded them, and one of the things they reflect is a different attitude
    to the formation of letters that is also reflected in the contemporary fashions
    in writing. And I think it is interesting that Baskerville's types went from being
    initially criticised by conservative readers and compared unfavourably with Caslon's
    to being emulated by virtually all the English founders of the next generation
    (the Frys, Martin, Austin). And that emulation is very, very obvious and it also
    very obviously takes place within a large text culture that is very different
    from that which inspired Caslon. So this takes us back to what I said -- which
    differs from what Noordzij said -- and which I am going to repeat:\r\n\r\n<em>What
    I am saying is that such influence takes place within a wider context of text
    creation that is only partially, if increasingly, typographic, and it is developments
    in this wider context that produce radical changes in the styles of type. In an
    important sense, I would say it doesn\u2019t matter whether a particular type
    designer of the past was more influenced by writing or by type, because what he
    was actually influenced by was a text culture within which writing and typography
    were not as compartmentalised as we have come to think of them.</em>\r\n\r\nOf
    course Baskerville knew Caslon's types and of course he was aware, intimately,
    of the ways in which his own were similar to or different from them. What matters
    -- why we care about Baskerville and why his types were so widely emulated --
    is the ways in which they were different and the reasons why they were different.
    Caslon's types were the end of the line for the Dutch oldstyle; in fact, they
    are primarily of interest because they were made in England and so came to play
    an important role in Anglo-American typography: if they'd been made in the Netherlands,
    we probably wouldn't pay any attention to them. Baskerville's types were the beginning
    of something, and they came to be seen as reflecting their cultural context better
    than the oldstyle types could.\r\n\r\nHere is a mental exercise that I recommend:
    imagine that you are a typesetter/printer in the later 18th century. Imagine that
    you are typesetting a new book, say James Harris' <em>Hermes, or a philosophical
    inquiry concerning universal gramma</em> (fascinating book, by the way), and you
    have before you the manuscript copy from which you are composing the type. Picture
    that manuscript copy. Now try to feel the cultural discomfort, the disconnection
    between that manuscript and the late renaissance or mannerist typeface that you
    have in your font of type. Today, we live in a typographic world full of revivals
    of historical models and a great diversity of styles, and because we don't very
    often encounter handwritten copy and because there is no culture of formal writing,
    we don't generally experience anything like this cultural disconnection between
    written and typographic forms that would have been very evident and awkward to
    earlier generations (the closest we come is when we see a piece of text set in
    what seems an inappropriate typeface). Indeed, one can argue that most of the
    history of innovation in type design has been in reaction to such disconnections,
    and should be seen in terms of correction and the bringing of typographic forms
    into line with the broader text culture, itself part of a larger intellectual
    and artistic culture. We see this even in the very beginnings of our 'roman' typographic
    forms, where a disconnection between the available blackletter types and the culture
    of Italian humanism prompted the invention of new styles of type based on the
    formal Italian book hand."

    write the formal, more readable upright humanist script. They were writing slanted,
    cursive hands that had less to do with the formal, highly readable upright script.
    Type was more readable than any script, so if you really wanted maximum readability
    you could just have it printed. If I'm right about that, then it would seem to
    me natural that designers of text types looked less to handwriting than to previous
    type designs. \r\n\r\n>I\u2019m not into guessing intentions, but I am interested

    guess: Baskerville told us what his goals were, and the fact that he was influenced
    by Caslon. If I am trying to do accurate history, I'm not going to ignore what
    the originator himself said, even if I don't have to take it fully at face value.
    In using the word 'emulation,' he was acknowledging a debt. I agree with you that
    the debt is less than for most designers, as he was one of the more original designers
    in type history. But there are signs of that debt, as I noted. \r\n\r\nBaskerville
    had been a writing master, and if he wanted to write about his debt to other writing
    masters he could have. He chose instead to write about his debt to Caslon, which
    I see as a significant choice. I agree about the influence of the contemporary
    pen and writing on contrast, but all the other stuff I don't see as a writing
    influence. That why I think it is reasonable to conclude that the bigger part
    of his problem-situation was type, rather than writing. \r\n\r\nOn Jenson and
    Griffo. You say that hand scripts had not changed much between the two, which
    would indicate that Griffo's inspiration was not from hand written script. However,
    you go on to minimize the diferences between the two. \r\n\r\nI think the differences
    are more significant, and move in a more typographic direction. For example Griffo's
    ascenders I believe lean a bit less to the right, his serifs are more symmetrical,
    and the crossbar on the e is horizontal. All of these features are more unnatural
    in writing, and they move further from the examples of the humanist script. That
    is why I conclude that Griffo was looking more at Jenson's type, and less at hand
    writing. \r\n\r\nJenson made the biggest leap, in my view, in making his type
    more upright and more even in color than hand writing, and so strikingly more
    readable.\r\n\r\nStill, I don't think that Stanley Morrison was just blowing smoke
    and advertising when he wrote that Griffo's types were more clearly modern and
    decisively set the pattern for later roman types. \r\n\r\nI hesitate to say that
    Griffo's type was more readable than Jenson's, as the breakthrough was really
    Jenson, and the differences may well be more aesthetic than in readability. Still,
    I have the feeling that Griffo does have a slight edge in readability, and I suspect
    it may have to do with more even color as well as the other features. But I haven't
    studied it enough to really have any firm opinion.   \r\n\r\nps on Caslon himself.
    You write:\r\n\r\n>Caslon\u2019s types were the end of the line for the Dutch
    oldstyle; in fact, they are primarily of interest because they were made in England
    and so came to play an important role in Anglo-American typography: if they\u2019d
    been made in the Netherlands, we probably wouldn\u2019t pay any attention to them.\r\n\r\nI
    agree that Caslon's place in history--and being the first old style to be revived--has
    a lot to do with the attention paid to his designs. But I do think he had he own
    sensibility about proportion and color that was admirable and highly readable.
    And that I, for one, think is worth trying to emulate in modern type. I am convinced
    that for all his vagaries, Caslon always proofed his characters between other
    characters, and had a very strong sense of what worked and didn't work. He didn't
    care so much about uniformity, but he had a very strong sense of what was readable,
    and it showed in his types.   "

    'type was more readable than any (handwritten) script'? This is a totally untestable
    supposition. Printed texts were quicker and more economical to produce, and they
    enabled text to be cleanly reproduced at smaller sizes than are comfortable to
    write, again making type more economical than manuscript. These factors alone
    account for the spread of printing. I've looked at a heck of a lot of manuscripts,
    and I don't think you can make a general case that type is more legible than writing:
    much depends on the quality of the individual production, whether the result of
    a better or worse scribe or a better or worse printer. Frankly, an awful lot of
    early printing was very bad, which we tend to forget because only the best stuff
    became famous and gets reproduced in histories of typography. The types got worn
    very quickly because the metal mixes were not right. The inking is uneven and
    the pressure is inconsistent. A lot of contemporary manuscripts were better, not
    least because the renaissance scribes realised that they were in competition with
    the new technology and needed to show just how good manuscript books could be.
    There was a late flowering of the European manuscript book tradition after the
    advent of printing; in the end it wasn't sufficient to counter the financial advantages
    of print publishing, but it produced some extraordinarily beautiful books that
    were specifically made to compete with print on the grounds of quality, including
    readability. I strongly recommend Jonathan Alexander's <em>The painted page: Italian
    renaissance book illumination, 1450-1550</em> for a well-illustrated overview
    of this period (it also deals with illumination of printed book).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/humanist_3920.jpg]\r\n
    \r\nI don't think it is possible to look at a manuscript like this and make a
    claim like this:\r\n\r\n<em>Jenson made the biggest leap, in my view, in making
    his type more upright and more even in color than hand writing, and so strikingly
    more readable.</em>\r\n\r\nJenson's biggest leap was to render the culturally
    acceptable form of humanist letters in type, so that the new technology would
    be accepted for the production of the kind of texts that the Italian renaissance
    readership (all of whom, as Bringhurst has drawn attention to in various places
    in the past few years, were not only readers but also writers). Sweynheym and
    Pannartz had begun this process at Subiaco and Rome, but never really got away
    from the blackletter. Jenson was more comfortable with the humanist script, so
    knew better how to cut letters to that model.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be necessary
    to point out that people are still making text faces based on those writing models,
    e.g. Adobe's new Arno Pro.\r\n \r\n<em>On Jenson and Griffo. You say that hand
    scripts had not changed much between the two, which would indicate that Griffo\u2019s
    inspiration was not from hand written script.</em>\r\n\r\nWhat I actually said
    was that the characteristics of both Jenson and Griffo's type are found in the
    larger context of Italian humanist text creation that includes manuscript hands.
    Like Peter, I'm not sure I know what it means to say that Griffo's letters were
    'more typographic', other than perhaps more regular. It shouldn't surprise us
    is that there is greater variety in the many individual manuscript hands than
    there is in the relatively small number of typefaces -- some of which are merely
    copies of other printers types: that sort of 'emulation' has always been with
    us --, and that the types represent only a subset of the ideas and forms found
    in the former.\r\n\r\nI'll agree with you that Noordzij sometimes overstates the
    case for writing -- which is why I prefer to draw attention to the overall phenomenon
    of text creation in which there isn't a compartmentalisation of writing and type,
    but only a single activity of making texts for people to read --, but Noordzij's
    overstatement is nothing compared to the uniquely typocentric view presented in
    most histories of typography, many of which completely ignore or gloss over the
    role of writing in the contemporary text creation cultures.\r\n\r\n"

    This is a totally untestable supposition.\r\n\r\nWell, I shouldn't have used the
    word 'any', because someone might very carefully and slowly imitate type, with
    a steel pen, enough to be approximately the same. But 'almost all' would do. Even
    if one compares deliberately calligraphic fonts--eg Brioso--with less calligraphic
    ones--eg Minion--the higher readability of typographic ones is striking to me.
    \ Testing readability is difficult in any case, but when better tests come along
    eg to distinguish eg. sans or all caps, I don't see why they can't test a hand
    written page against a printed one. I have suggested such tests (testing for fatigue),
    but they haven't been done, to my knowledge.\r\n\r\n>Baskerville\r\n\r\nYou didn't
    respond to my rebuttal of your hypothetical analysis of how Baskerville might
    looked at contemporary writing and was influenced. I think my analysis based on
    what Baskerville said about his own goals is more plausible, because it addresses
    the actual historical record.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I suspect the further
    removed from Jenson we are historically, the less contemporary handwriting influences
    designers of text types. Writing always remains an \"underlying force\", as van
    Krimpen said, based on the origination of our letter shapes in writing. And designers
    may get ideas from their own experiments in writing, done with an eye to type.
    \r\n\r\nThe biggest change in type after Baskerville is perhaps the introduction
    of fat faces and sans serifs. And I don't see how these have anything to do with
    writing, aside from high contrast in the case of fat faces. They were, I believe,
    influenced by architectural lettering and sign painting. Those are important non-type
    influences on type, but they are not writing. And they were influenced by the
    needs of advertising--large sized, attention-getting type. \r\n\r\nI will respond
    later on Jenson, Griffo and what is typographic."

    takes Baskerville's praise as sarcastic, but I don't think that holds water. First
    of all that Baskerville was quite willing to criticize Caslon, all be it with
    some tact. He very clearly implies that Caslon was sloppy because he was so busy
    creating a \"variety\" of characters--for Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, etc.
    Baskerville says he was going to concentrate on the roman and italic, and do a

    But the wide, symmetric arches and the vertical stress are not a characteristic

    \r\n\r\nSo I don't think that Baskerville completely rejected Caslon because of
    contemporary writing, which I take to be Noordzij's claim here. He in fact took
    Caslon's roman as his starting point, and then changed it radically, based partly
    on influences from writing, but even more from the tastes of Neo-Classical architecture
    and design. \r\n\r\nps. As an illustration of the visual culture of the 18th century.
    Take the hand written version of the Declaration of Independence, done in a slanted,
    asymmetrical, high contrast cursive--not a humanist hand--and the printed version,
    in Caslon. Mix the two and you can't come up with Baskerville. But add in the
    neo-classical arch, and bingo, there it is.     "

    test a hand written page against a printed one.</em>\r\n\r\nBut such a test still
    wouldn't tell us whether 15th century Venetian readers found type more readable
    than manuscript, as your initial comment suggested, and which is obviously unfalsifiable
    since we can't go back in time and test them. My guess, based on the nature of
    the text culture of the time, is that they really didn't make much of a difference
    between one kind of book and another. They read both, and in both the form of
    the letters were substantially and deliberately the same. And when they started
    reading Greek books too they favoured those that Aldus printed in types that were,
    similarly, based on contemporary written forms.\r\n\r\n<em>Well, I shouldn\u2019t
    have used the word \u2019any\u2019, because someone might very carefully and slowly
    imitate type, with a steel pen, enough to be approximately the same.</em>\r\n\r\nBut
    these letterforms pre-date the type. Why is that so hard for you to grasp. The
    scribes weren't imitating type, the type was imitating the scribes. And this isn't
    something peculiar to renaissance Italy: it is the norm for the reduction of script
    to typography around the world. You see the same pattern repeated again and again:
    the normative forms of typographic letters are based on the formal manuscript
    book hand of the time in which the new technology is introduced.\r\n\r\n<em>Even
    if one compares deliberately calligraphic fonts\u2014eg Brioso\u2014with less

    comments suggested that 15th century type was more readable that 15th century
    manuscripts to 15th century readers. And that is an untestable assertion and one
    that I think is contradicted by the text culture of the day.\r\n\r\nNote also
    that I explicitly rejected the term 'calligraphic', which is ahistorical and symptomatic
    of the lack of understanding of scribal culture. Calligraphers produce calligraphy,

    <em>That\u2019s a nice theory in the case of Baskerville, but Noordzij has no
    evidence for it. My account does have very good evidence, namely what Baskerville
    actually said. And did.</em>\r\n\r\nI think you are misreading Noordzij, because
    you are looking for specific instances of the import of characteristics of written
    forms into the typefaces. What Noordzij refers to is the type maker's 'attitude'
    to writing. And when he says that 'the old typefaces did not keep pace with the
    development of writing' he is not suggesting that the typefaces needed to emulate
    writing but that they needed to belong to the same text culture. This is what
    I was getting at in my suggested mental exercise above: imagining the page of
    handwritten copy, directly expressing the intellectual culture of its day, and
    the types used to set that text for print. They don't have to look the same, in
    their structure or characteristics, but they do have to harmonise. We have the
    same sense when we see any typeface used inappropriately for particular content;
    people living in a text culture in which handwriting, including formal writing,
    still played an important role had a broader context in which things were expected
    to be harmonious. They didn't have a sufficient variety of types or a culture
    of revival of older styles to concern themselves with appropriateness of types
    to particular texts -- indeed, they republished older texts in the new types,
    to repackage them for contemporary audiences (e.g. Baskerville's famous edition
    of Milton) --; instead, they were concerned to harmonise typography to their overall
    text culture. And in this writing led the way, not because it was more important
    than type, but simply because it is more dynamic and evolved at a faster pace
    than type, which was slow and expensive to make.\r\n\r\nBut let's go back to Baskerville
    and the 'historical record'...\r\n\r\nIf you still think Baskerville emulated
    Caslon to produce his 'radically' different design (your word), consider this:\r\n\r\nJohn
    Handy cut Baskerville's types for him in the 1750s. In the <em>previous</em> decade,
    George Bickham compiled and published <em>The Universal Penman</em>, which includes
    a handful of examples of roman and italic letters obviously aspiring to typographic
    regularity and form. These are so obviously the model style for Baskerville's
    types, displaying the familiar characteristics that we associate with those types
    -- the slung bowl of the a, the open lower counter of the g -- that one could
    only accept the 'emulating Caslon' explanation by deliberately ignoring the physical
    evidence. This style of lettering was something worked out by mid-18th century
    writing masters intent on expressing, in all the varied styles of lettering they
    employed -- the most common slanted connecting script, the disconnected italics
    and romans, even the gothick --, the common aesthetic of their text culture. Baskerville
    had been such a writing master before his turn to printing, and knew those styles
    and how the aesthetic was applied to the unconnected roman and italic letters
    on which he based his types.\r\n\r\nMy camera battery is dead, but when it has
    recharged I will post some photos of these letterforms."

    actually precedes Caslon, and is found in inscriptional memorials and tombstones
    even at the beginning of the 18th century. Again, if you are looking at type only
    in the context of other type, you are simply going to miss all this. Caslon looked
    to the Netherlands for models for his type, but if he had looked closer to home,
    in the graveyards and in the inscribed and engraved lettering on brass and copper,
    he might have hit upon something akin to Baskerville's types a couple of decades
    earlier. By the time Baskerville turned to printing, the tradition had matured
    and found systematic expression in the works of the writing masters, as compiled
    by Bickham.

  body: "I will be interested to see Bickham's roman letters. However, I'm not sure
    how decisive they will be on the issue of the influence of writing on type. This
    is because you yourself say that they are \"aspiring to typographic regularity
    and form.\" So it is hard to say that writing is in the driver's seat, as I read
    Noordzij as saying. \r\n\r\nAt any rate it is not worth arguing over what exactly
    Noordzij meant to say, as he will no doubt explain himself further in other writings.
    \r\n\r\nWhat is important that I think you are missing is that type designers
    such as Jenson and Griffo were not only emulating the best scribal hands of their
    day, but they were also changing them decisively. And the changes, though subtle,
    decisively improved readability. That is why I think the issue is testable. Because
    I think some types are inherently more readable because of human psychology, and
    their increased readability has to do with their departure from writing.\r\n\r\nMy
    view on this, I now remember, is influenced not by Morrison, but by the analysis
    of Harry Carter, who I think you will agree had a very good knowledge of the scribal
    culture as well as type design. And he, it seems, didn't have Morrison's ego or
    commercial agenda.   \r\n\r\nCarter talks about how Felice Feliciano started drawing
    letters with reference to mathematical schemes. These were artificial, Carter
    says, but they performed a key service of separating the idea of an ideal form
    for letters from the actual movement of the pen. The impact of this separation
    on the punch cutter \r\n\r\n\"was good: he was at liberty to use files and gravers
    to express the ideal forms and no longer obliged to copy the way in which penmen
    had tried to approximate to them. \r\n\r\n\"I have said that the best masters
    of letter-cutting had the greatest respect for penstrokes and judged type by their
    fidelity to them. ...I am now arguing that ...using his particular tools to produce
    mentally conceived images makes the best type; and I think this is right also.
    ...It is because [Griffo] understood what I am trying to say so well ...that the
    Roman font ...[for]De Aetna was decisive in shaping the printer's alphabet. \r\n\r\nThe
    small letters are very well made to conform with the genuinely antique capitals
    by emphasis on long straight strokes and fine serifs and to harmonize in curvature
    with them. The strokes are thinner than those of Jenson and his school... . The
    balancing of the weight of capitals and lower case is helped by making the capitals
    line at the head with the undersides of the serifs of lower-case ascenders, not
    with their tops as Jenson's do. The letters look narrower than Jenson's but in
    fact are a little wider because the short ones are bigger [x-height ?], and the
    effect of narrowness makes the face suitable for octavo pages.\"\r\n\r\nCarter
    earlier praised Jenson as producing types that have been unsurpassed for \"folios
    and quartos\", but pointedly reserves the honor for octavos to Griffo as producing
    the model for later types.\r\n\r\nThis point about smaller sizes is actually quite
    important. Scribes, at least in the stuff I have seen, produced letters of larger
    size than the 8-12 that in some tests--not ideal tests, but extensive ones--are
    most readable. Not larger, not smaller. Part of the readability comes just from
    being able to size things for the eye, rather than the hand. But all of those
    changes that Griffo introduced, and I believe others that Jenson started, affect
    not only the regularity of type, but also its evenness of color. These are also
    important to readability, in my view. \r\n\r\nIn your manuscript example--which
    is trying but failing to emulate the readability of type--the r's for example
    have significantly different widths, and the spacing is not the even look of type.
    Also it is more upright than other humanist writing I have seen, again going against
    the tendency of the hand, and following type. But also I think that--contrary
    to Carter--it is probably impossible by the broad pen of fixed width to get the
    size and ratios of vertical stems, horizontal stems, diagonal stems, widths of
    arches, thickness and shapes of serifs that Jenson and Griffo have. The even rhythm
    and color of extended text in type is superior to almost all written work, to
    my eyes.  \r\n\r\nI certainly have not made a study of these early types to be
    able to a good case for my view here. But I do note that Harry Carter does decisively
    disagree with your view, John, that \"Griffo\u2019s innovations are pretty minor
    and well within the influence of the formal humanist book hand.\" The differences
    are subtle, but Carter clearly thinks that the differences, some of which he notes,
    are major. \r\n\r\nI think they are not only major, but that Jenson and Griffo
    made type significantly more readable than writing.  "

    manipulations consolidated the robustness of the affordances proper to readable
    writing at text sizes and extended it to smaller sizes?\r\n\r\nBecause it goes
    beyond small size. If you draw a stem with a fixed width nib, such as I understand
    they were using, fixed say at 30 degrees, you are going to get vertical stems
    and the thick part of vertical arches the same width. And the diagonals going
    left to right, top to bottom are going to have a thicker cross section than the
    verticals. The horizontal serifs are going to be asymmetrical, fatter to the right.
    \r\n\r\nIn Griffo's Bembo type, if it is similar to most later text types, which
    I am supposing it is as their ancestor, then none of this holds. The vertical
    arches are thicker than the vertical stems. The thick diagonals are about the
    same cross section as the vertical stems, not significantly fatter. And the serifs
    are fairly symmetrical, tapering similarly on both sides. All of this, with the
    possible exception of the serifs, helps to have even color in the letters. \r\n\r\nMy
    conjectures about readability of the printers types of Jenson and Griffo are just
    that, conjectures. But the reality is that the punch cutter was creating forms
    that the scribe would not have done in the normal course of events, and might
    not be able to do at all, even rotating the pen continually.  \r\n\r\nThe underlying
    point which I think Noordzij doesn't note sufficiently, is that what is good for
    the eye to read and what is easy for the hand to write are two different things.
    Sometimes they match, and some times--like slant--they diverge. Printer's type
    liberated designers to be able to meet the needs of the readers eye, rather than
    the convenience of the writer's hand. "

    argue with me damnit! :)\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the characteristic forms we find
    in Baskerville's types, by which we recognise them and assign them to particular
    categorisation distinct from preceding types, were worked out with <em>pens</em>
    by <em>writing</em> masters as part of an overall aesthetic within contemporary
    text culture. Yes, they are very carefully written forms that emulate the generic
    regularity of type, <em>but they do not resemble any existing typefaces</em>.
    Only later are these styles of written letters translated into type by Baskerville.
    So there is a kind of symbiosis: written letters aspiring to the regularity of
    typographic letters, but introducing new forms, new ductus and new details, inspiring
    new typefaces. This shouldn't surprise us <em>if</em> we keep before us the idea
    of a single text culture in which writing and typography are parallel means of
    creating text, evolving at different paces but tending to harmony.\r\n\r\nRe.
    the earlier development and relationship of the typographic forms of Jenson and
    Griffo to the contemporary formal bookhand, I've never suggested that typographic
    letters were or should be direct representations of writing. There is always a
    question of scale which must never be ignored, and as soon as you start reducing
    the size of letters you need to make changes to their form, weight and spacing.
    I think we agree on this (Peter too), and perhaps we can say that this is what
    constitutes the distinctive character of typographic letters (at least in the
    Latin script tradition; some of the world's writing systems, including Hebrew
    and Arabic, have traditions of micrography in which the proportions that we associate
    with typographic letters are worked out with very small pens).\r\n\r\nYou say:
    <em>The differences are subtle, but Carter clearly thinks that the differences,
    some of which he notes, are major.</em>\r\n\r\nMy point is that they are, indeed,
    subtle, and can only be considered 'major' in the limited context of a history
    that only looks at types and not at a broader text culture. There's nothing wrong
    with such a history, if it acknowledges it's limitations, and I'm quite happy
    to argue the importance of quite small details in different typefaces. God is
    in the details. But the 'big picture' has to include everything that contributes
    to contemporary text culture, not just one technology. I'm sensitive to this issue
    at the moment, because based on the fantasy of typography as an entirely separate,
    progressive field, some of the world's writing systems are being reduced to type
    in ways that are completely cut off from the mainstream of text creation in their
    respective cultures. So to me this isn't an abstract historical discussion about
    renaissance Italy and Georgian England, but about looking at text cultures as
    holistic phenomena."

    just experiential reports. Beyond that there is...</em>\r\n\r\n...still no science,
    just performance statisitics for specific fonts.\r\n\r\n<em>Controlling salience
    and optimizing cue-value through manipulation of proportion, weight, contrast
    and construction are type\u2019s ways to go about this [affordance].</em>\r\n\r\nHow
    can affordance be \"technically and scientifically tractable\" when it is tied
    to such typeface-specific, multi-variant concepts? Suppose, for instance, that
    one wished to determine an optimum \"proportion\" -- i.e. generate a performance
    curve -- for x-height. One might produce half-a-dozen variants of a typeface,
    and discover that different versions worked better in different settings, depending
    on size, leading and line length. Then, applying the same procedure to a different
    typeface, one would discover that variant \"A\" of typeface \"y\" worked better
    in type specs 1 and 2, whereas variant C of typeface \"z\" was more suited to
    those specs. And so on. \r\n\r\nFor \"construction\", would it be possible to
    discover the optimum-affordance combination of single and double-story \"a\" and
    \"g\"? The Futura scheme would probably not fare well, but how would News Gothic
    do against Helvetica? Tests would have to be made of both Helvetica vs. Helvetica
    with a News Gothic style g, and News Gothic vs. News Gothic with a Helveticized
    g, and then test the winners against each other. \r\n\r\nBut is the quest for
    a theoretical gestalt logic of reading similar to theoretical physics, in a technical
    and scientific sense?\r\nThere is no particle accelerator, no mathematical equations.
    \r\nPeter, what you are proposing is aesthetic or design theory. Nothing wrong
    with that. Although it is based on biological research it is not scientific, it's
    more like a theory of marketing based on market testing.\r\n\r\nYou say, \"What

  body: "Bill,  From <em>Has Psychology a Future</em> by Eleanor J[ack] Gibson: \u201CAffordance,
    a term coined by J J Gibson (1979), refers to a reciprocal relationship between
    an animal and its environment The environment provides opportunities, and the
    animal provides (or does not provide) an action system that can utilize what the
    environment offers. Perceiving the relationship is perceiving an affordance, an
    animal-environment fit.\u201D \r\n\r\nEleanor Gibson uses the example of a child
    reaching for something, which involves, among other things, a expectation that
    the object it is reaching for affords being grasped.\r\n\r\nFrom:  <em>Gibson's
    Affordances</em> by James G. Greeno (Psychological Review 1994, Vol. 101, No.
    2, 336-342)\r\n\u201CThe idea is quite straightforward. In any interaction involving
    an agent with some other system, conditions that enable that interaction include
    some properties of the agent along with some properties of the other system. [\u2026]
    An affordance relates attributes of something in the environment to an interactive
    activity by an agent who has some ability, and an ability relates attributes of
    an agent to an interactive activity with something in the environment that has
    some affordance.\u201D\r\n\r\nHere the example is \u201Cthe affordance of an aperture
    for a person to walk from one side of a partition to the other. The affordance
    provided by an aperture is a function of its width, and the ability of a person
    to move through the aperture depends on the person's width.\r\n\r\nMy point has
    been that, involved in reading are at the very least <em>perceptual discrimination</em>
    affordances and <em>visual wordform resolutional</em> affordances which differ
    from simple <em>letter-identity resolutional</em> affordances.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick,
    perceptual discrimination affordances and visual wordform resolutional affordances
    are indeed tied to a type-specific, multi-variant system of interactive parameters.
    So the most that can be expected might indeed be performance testing. However,
    it might be useful to think of performance testing as exploring the \u201Caffordance
    structure\u201D of the font or font system when it comes to reading. Each font,
    I'd think, has its own optimums, ranges of affordances and thresholds. ( I use
    the plural, because fonts behave differently in different contexts of use.) And
    affordances change.\r\n\r\nBut I still think that if we dig deeper into these
    affordance structures we will find a deeper logic of salience (for instance),
    which is less plastic than you seem to want to think, but more forgiving than
    you think I want to find. It is a logic more characterized by ranges and thresholds
    than by sharp peaks flanked by dramatic drops.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn, you asked:  \u201Cdoes
    it affect the way you read if you are also a writer?\u201D That's a whole \u2019nother
    ball of wax, but I think writing encourages an intimacy with the featural structure
    of the script, that has to impact what our neural receptive fields become alert
    to or \u2018trained on\u2019. Type-design might do the same, but perhaps only
    if it is informed by knowledge of ductal logic.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid, from Jasper's
    view of history I might learn the importance of constructing my own take on history.
    I think we might all agree that the tools of the punch-cutter and the spline-bender
    afford a broader scope of featureal manipulation, that has it's uses. The problem
    is in how best to state what the products of these efforts at featureal adjustment
    represent within the broader worlds of writing culture and affordances."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bask1_6576.jpg]\r\nThe images in this
    post are all taken from George Bickham's <em> The Universal Penman</em>, compiled
    and published in various parts and editions between 1733 and 1741, i.e. more than
    a decade <em>before</em> John Handy cut type punches in these styles at the direction
    of John Baskerville. Bickham published not only engraved examples of his own writing,
    but also that of more than a dozen contemporary writing masters. The images shown
    here are by various hands, including Emanuel Austin, John Bickham, Joseph Champion,
    William Leekey, Samual Vaux, and George Bickham himself. Other plates in <em>
    The Universal Penman</em> show the same styles written by other writers, demonstrating
    that these styles of roman and italic letters were a mature and standard part
    of the repertoire of the 18th century English writing masters in the first half
    of the century. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bask2_6352.jpg]\r\nThis
    image shows the basic character of the style, as written by John Bickham in 1736.
    Note the open lower bowl of the italic g, a feature by which Baskerville's types
    are most easily recognised.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bask3_5664.jpg]\r\nThis
    is not type. This is carefully written text that wants to be type. But it can't
    be type, because the typeface doesn't exist yet. This is text waiting for Baskerville's
    types, and in the meantime written by hand.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bask6_4755.jpg]\r\nHere
    is the context for the previous image. This shows well the nature of the harmonious
    text aesthetic that this kind of roman letter is created to fit within, and nicely
    relates it to contemporary illustration in the versal cap. Even in the midst of
    neo-classicism, the English didn't completely lose their taste for gothick letters,
    which remained part of the basic repertoire of any writing master, but used flourishes
    to incorporate this style of lettering withing the larger asethetic.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/basktomb1_4434.jpg]\r\nThis
    practice is demonstrated to full effect in this illustration. [There will be more
    about tombs in a later post, once I have compiled some images of even earlier
    lettering in the English roman and italic styles from gravestones and memorial
    tablets.]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bask4_3575.jpg]\r\nAnother
    example of the roman and italic styles, written by Emanuel Austin in 1736.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bask5_4931.jpg]\r\nAnd
    another, written by Joseph Champion in 1738.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xB6What all these images
    show is a model of formal roman and italic letters <em>worked out with a pen</em>
    and fully mature more than a decade before Baskerville produced the first typefaces
    in these styles. This does not undermine Baskerville's achievement -- the types
    show innovations appropriate to their medium and scale, and the careful selection
    of features to be locked into single forms from among the variety possible within
    the style is no mean feat --, but it very seriously undermines the idea that Baskerville's
    types are in any way derived from Caslon's. Baskerville may well have considered
    the latter in technical terms, examining their fit, alignment, etc. But the style
    of his types is exactly that developed by the writing masters. It is only possible
    to draw any kind of direct line between the design of Caslon's types and those
    of Baskerville by willfully ignoring all this writing."

    to inspire and instruct writers.\r\n\r\nI think the basic point is well made,
    in any case: the design aesthetic that informs Baskerville's type was well established
    over a decade before those types were made. It was part of a broader text culture
    with a distinctive canon of styles and forms based on the work of writing masters.
    A very similar thing, it should be noted, was happening in France, resulting in
    Fournier's types. Notable in this canon is the absence of even the latter styles
    of oldstyle types derived from the renaissance and mannerist line, of which Caslon's
    types were the last flowering. The text aesthetic developed in England in the
    18th century comes out of vernacular written, inscribed, engraved and cast letterforms,
    and is only latterly translated into type by Baskerville, Fry, Martin, and Austin.\r\n\r\nThe
    pen has in its favour the ready speed with which a practiced writer can produce
    shapes. It also has in its favour the sheer volume of handwritten text compared

    pointed pen can\u2019t be on the order of facsimilies or perfect imitations of
    actual writng. The oblique strokes in the w and v of the romans give this away,
    because in writing with the pointed pen expansion has to be perpendicular to the
    angle of the pen, and not perpendicular to the direction of the stroke, unless

    leave me convinced that Caslon was an important influence.</em>\r\n\r\nAn influence
    on what? I don't think you can claim that they were an influence on the new style
    of type, because the styles are so different and, in any case, Baskerville's types
    are in essentials identical to the George Shelley's alphabet of 1715 as shown
    in the plate that James provides. Some letters are different -- the Q, thanfully
    -- but they are also different from Caslon's and I suspect if one dug through
    enough exemplars from the writing masters one would find a model for every form
    in Baskerville's types. Why? Because the forms can all be worked out with a split
    nib pen -- even if a typical typographic contrast pattern sometimes requires rotation
    of the pen, which was not unheard of as Bodoni's swash letters make plain -- ,
    and these guys had been doing this for decades. I doubt if there was any workable
    shape that had not been fully explored with a pen by the time Baskerville came
    to cast it in type.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with trying to make a structural link between
    Baskerville's types and Caslon's evidence of influence or emulation is that you
    should first remove from the equation the structural similarities that are common
    to >90% of Latin text faces, that are accounted for by adjustments proper to the
    scale of the letters. Baskerville may have looked at Caslon's types to gain an
    understanding of what makes type work, because they were the most readily available
    samples, but he may well have relied on John Handy's expertise to provide that
    understanding. It is important to bear this in mind, because when we say that
    Baskerville 'designed' these types we run the risk of imagining an anachronistic
    industrial design process. Handy would have cut punches according to the knowledge
    of his craft, based on some form of model provided by Baskerville. This model
    would not have been 'drawings', of the kind that we are familiar with from much
    later, mechanical punch cutting processes. What were they? I think they were almost
    certainly pen-written letters of the kind shown in Shelley and Bickham's writing
    manuals, which Baskerville, as a writing master, would have been able to produce
    with ease and speed. Handy would have interpreted the letters to make them work
    at the sizes of type specified by Baskerville (just as, two centuries later, August
    Rosenberger interpreted in metal the written and drawn letters provided by Hermann
    Zapf).\r\n\r\nBaskerville did emulate Caslon, but primarily in the still novel
    notion of making original types in England, rather than importing them from the
    continent, as had been the norm for almost three hundred years. But Caslon based
    his types on the style of those imported types, while Baskerville based his on
    indigenous lettering styles.\r\n\r\nWhen Baskerville speaks of Caslon 'leaving
    room for improvement', I don't think he is referring merely to certain technical
    deficiencies such as poor vertical alignment and inconsistent serif weight, but
    also to the inappropriateness of Caslon's types to the neo-classical text aesthetic.
    The room for improvement was the gulf between the text culture of Holland a hundred
    years previous and the text culture of contemporary Britain."

    and engraving technically permit high contrast, fine hairlines, etc. And yet the
    normative model of typographic letterforms from the 15th to the mid-18th century
    remained based on the translation contrast pattern of the broad-nib pen. It was
    not until after the development of the split-nib pen and its associated writing
    styles, based on an expansion contrast pattern, that type founders began to make
    types that were modeled on that pattern. The fact that it would have been technically
    possible to cut such types at an earlier date is notable precisely because no
    one chose to do so: the technology precedes the writing, but the writing precedes
    the application of the technology to those forms.\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting
    to note that between the translation model of the renaissance broad nib and the
    flourishing of the expansion model of the split nib in the 18th century, one finds
    the rotation model of the mannerist and early baroque writing masters. And yet
    one sees almost no influence of this different technique and, hence, different
    contrast pattern, in the roman text types of this period, which stick pretty doggedly
    to the translation model. The obvious explanation for this is that the mannerist
    writing masters did not provide a model for such types: they did not apply the
    new writing techniques to those kinds of letters. You do find some evidence of
    rotation in italics, though, and in the civilit\xE9 types which were modeled on
    the popular writing style of the time. In the 18th century, by contrast, we have
    writing masters such as Shelley explicitly providing models for typographic roman
    letterforms produced with the preferred tool of the day according to the preferred
    techniques of the day.\r\n\r\nSo not only do we have the evidence of type founders
    creating types that follow trends and models set by writing masters, we also <em>don't</em>
    see them creating types based on other potential models when these are not provided
    by the writing masters, despite the technical ability to make any shape that the
    cutting, punching and casting processes would permit. Overall, typography prior
    to the 20th century comes across as a very conservative field, following behind
    the much more dynamic development of new formal writing styles. There are good
    economic reasons for this: making type was a costly and time consuming business,
    while a writing master needed only a pen, some ink and some paper to develop and
    practice a new style.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>I can see the influence of the pointed nib
    on loopy scripts like Bickham, but not on romans.</em>\r\n\r\nThen you're blind.
    Sorry, but there's no polite way to put it. From Baskerville to Didot to Bodoni
    the expansion contrast pattern is the defining basis of the new styles (much more
    than axis, by the way, which actually varied a lot more than the popular revivals
    indicate). Not only is it possible to emulate all these styles of types using
    a split nib pen, it is impossible to emulate them with any other kind of pen (presuming
    one is writing the strokes and not drawing the letter).\r\n\r\nThe lower contrast,
    sans serif letters were based on a different but still contemporary style of <em>drawn</em>
    lettering (see James' <em>The Nymph and the Grot</em>. No one is claiming that
    the split nib was the only tool used during this period, or that the styles of
    writing associated with it were the only styles of lettering either popular or
    invented during the period. But it was the only tool used for the principle styles
    of formal writing, and evidence of the broad nib is only found in the gothick."

    of design?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure who the first person was to describe himself as
    a 'type designer' or when, but I suspect it was quite late, and reflects a process
    of design within an industrial type manufacturing setting. As I wrote earlier,
    I'm pretty sure that Baskerville's design process consisted of sitting down and
    writing the style of letters that he wanted, and John Handy translated the written
    forms into type.\r\n\r\nWe know that, earlier, renaissance printers hired writing
    masters to produce models for italic types and or modeled their types on the writing
    of specific scribes, whose names are known to us.\r\n\r\nAnd I wonder what Griffo's
    design process was for the Aldine roman types? Obviously there is an evaluation
    of Jenson's types involved, but how did he -- and many future generations of 'designers'
    -- actually visualise the letters to be cut in the end of the bits of metal? It
    is very unlikely that he worked directly in the metal without a model -- the fact
    that Rudolf Koch did this was notably unconventional --, so what did the model
    look like, and how did he create it? I think we can be reasonably sure that he
    did not produce draughtsman's englarged drawings of a kind that only became necessary
    with the introduction of mechanism punchcutting. I think it is overwhelmingly
    likely that he used a broad nib pen and carefully wrote the forms he intended
    to translate into type, because of course he was not only a punchcutter, he was
    also a writer, just like every other literate person of his time. He may not have
    been a great calligrapher or a professional writing master, but he knew how to
    handle a pen just as he knew, as a punchcutter, how to translate those written
    models into metal and what adjustments to make for scale and technical limitations.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    Arrighi's italic types seem to have required fewer ligatures than Griffo's, suggesting
    that the professional writing master had better insights into how to adapt letters
    to the technology, while Griffo tried to follow a particular written model that
    obliged him to use more ligatures."

    to the theme this year in <em>Forum</em>, the journal of Letter Exchange, and
    in papers at Bologna and at ATypI in Brighton.\r\n\r\nThe title is ironic, since
    \u2018English' refers to the round hand script of 1700 and after that was called
    English in France and other countries (<em>l'\xE9criture anglaise</em>), but derives
    from French, Dutch and, above all, Italian models. My hero then, as now, is the
    calligrapher Giovan Francesco Cresci, who introduced flowing writing using the
    flexible pointed pen in about 1560, and changed the shape of Western writing and
    typography.\r\n\r\nThe common charge against the new calligraphy is that it was
    not only unnatural (since Nature had ordained the broad pen) but that it was a
    perverse attempt to copy the brilliant work of copper plate engravers. That is
    only to say that the new generation of Italian (then Dutch and French) copy books
    was indeed engraved on copper and that the style was increasingly used in the
    lettering of maps and prints. I think stylish and brilliant copperplate models
    are to some extent responsible for the increasing contrast between thick and thin
    that appears in the bigger types of the 17th century (these have been noted in
    this thread), and I would add to this the tendency of their serifs to become thinner,
    the appearance of \u2018fish hook' serifs in the C, G and S of Dutch types like
    Van Dijck's (and their adoption in England) and the appearance of the calligraphic
    double-curve to the tail of capital R that can be seen in several 17th-century
    English types.\r\n\r\nIf the 18th-century \u2018English' style became a force
    to be reckoned with in the history of writing and type generally it was because
    of the increasing strength of British industrial power at home and the creation
    of a new maritime empire, based on trade, and held together with a web of paper
    documents, bills of lading, letters of credit, and so on, that needed to be clearly,
    accurately and impressively written. Hence the rise of the English writing masters,
    and sooner or later, their power to influence print. It is symbolic that this
    was achieved by a writing master who became a successful self-made industrialist
    in the boom town of Birmingham, miles from the tightly-knit, conservative book
    trade of London. Caslon, a Midlander like Baskerville, chose to join this conservative
    world and did very well for himself by catering for it competently, whereas Baskerville
    was notoriously seen by many Londoners as a strange being from outer space.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    Nick, the notion of British \u2018perpetual copyright' was not so much changed
    by law in 1774 as be discovered to be non-existent \u2013 but you are right in
    pointing to the legal case of this year as a key event which decided the matter.
    It generated a boom in competing editions of the same text for which new types
    and new wove paper were used as promotional features. And this opening up of the
    market for books, which fed off the rise of a new rich middle class, generated
    a demand for the new, distinctive, \u2018modern cut', types of the 1780s and after.\r\n\r\nIf
    I can marshal these arguments effectively, I shall do my best to use them in a
    new text of \u2018English vernacular'. And I shall be delighted to go on reading

    knowledgeable analysis than my guessing. \r\n\r\nI have made no pretense of knowing
    the history of writing here. What I did react against was what seemed to me an
    exaggerated claim of Noordzij, that later type designers disregarded what earlier
    type designers did, and only looked to writing. Having spent recently a lot of
    time designing letters, I just don't find that plausible. I may have misinterpreted
    Noordzij, but my impression from reading both <em>Letter Letter</em> and <em>The
    Stroke</em> (translated by Peter) is that he has brilliant new insights on the
    development of letters, but that he at times claims they are the whole story rather
    than part of the story. \r\n\r\n>you are arguing against yourself. \r\n\r\nWell,
    yes, after Peter's argument I said I thought I was wrong, but then had second--or
    third--thoughts about that as I looked a little more into the history. Now that
    James confirms my guess that there <em>was</em> an influence of engraving on the
    adoption of the pointed, flexible pen, I am thinking now that the story is one
    of <em>interaction</em> between the crafting of letters in different media. \r\n\r\n>Then
    you\u2019re blind. Sorry, but there\u2019s no polite way to put it.  \r\n\r\nYou
    are, um, jumping to conclusions. My guess, which may well be wrong, is that the
    letters such as the Shelly letters James showed us are constructed, not written.
    By that I mean that they look carefully built up of many strokes, not truly 'written',
    with a continuously moving front. I see that Nick also has the same feeling. And
    if I read him rightly, David also sees them this way. Can you tell us more about
    how these letters were made, James?\r\n\r\nReading the Wikipedia article about
    the pointed nib, I see that you can't do a thick upstroke with the pointed nib,
    but have great control on the down strokes. I think I can see affects of that
    in the cursive styles, which are more written, but the Roman look to me constructed,
    and keeping largely to the earlier rules of where contrast should fall--but just
    made more vertical.  \r\n\r\nPeter wrote that there was an 'expansion contrast
    template'. Thinking about it further, I do see that the vertical stress would
    be more natural with the pointed nib, as you could bear down on the vertical down
    strokes, and in that sense he is right. However, you also have the tradition of
    'constructed' letters, from the 15th century on. I see an example of a vertical
    stress letter from the Romain du Roi, and I am wondering how early vertical stress
    'constructed' letters exist--do they exist before the pointed pen? \r\n\r\nSo
    I would concede to Peter and you at this point that the vertical stress seems
    more natural with the pointed pen. But I am wondering whether the point pen is
    following design ideas from earlier, with constructed letters, and letters created
    in other media: punch-cut, painted, stone carved, engraved. \r\n\r\n>I\u2019m
    not sure who the first person was to describe himself as a \u2019type designer\u2019
    or when, but I suspect it was quite late\r\n\r\nI know that applying the term
    'type designer' to Jenson is anachronistic, but I don't think it is misleading.
    As Harry Carter pointed out in the passage I quoted above, the earlier creators
    of printers type such as Jenson and Griffo were not simply copying writing, but
    were cutting their punches to conform to models that were in their heads. In that
    sense they were designers, whatever medium they used to create letters. \r\n\r\nI
    suspect that the 'rotation of the pen' in Dutch typefaces is an example of such
    interaction. You can get the vertical stress of the 'o' by changing the pen angle
    from the 'e'. But the question is, why would you bother to do this, which takes
    extra trouble in writing? It seems to me you would do this if you wanted to conform
    to a different design idea that you were trying to produce on paper.    \r\n\r\nAnd
    just for the record, when I write for publication, I thoroughly study the history
    of what I am writing about, unlike my guessing and rambling here on Typophile.

    nibs are notoriously difficult to use to write letters this large), or that Baskerville
    might have drawn rather than written his models for John Handy or used some mix
    of writing and drawing, doesn't alter the fact that what is employed in the shapes
    is a contrast pattern that is distinctive and based on that of the split nib pen.
    And for obvious reasons: the goal was to make harmonious letters at a range of
    sizes, all in keeping with the dominant text aesthetic (the social and economic
    background of which James has nicely encapsulated). So Shelley and other writing
    masters write at the sizes at which they can write, and draw at the sizes at which

    in contact with the page.\r\n\r\nOne finds the first kind of rotation in all kinds
    of scripts, styles and periods, and this is what produces letters with variable
    axes. It is, for example, an essential component of the Byzantine cursive Greek
    miniscule, which always displays some variation in ductus.\r\n\r\nRotation within
    stroke is much less common, but this is the characteristic of mannerist writing
    with a broad nib that Noordzij has analysed so well in the work of Jan van den
    Velde. It is a virtuoso method: very difficult to learn but stunning when done
    well. So far as I can tell, it was not applied to 'roman' letterforms, though,
    and it's influence in type, beyond civilit\xE9, seems minimal and limited to some
    features in italics.\r\n\r\nThe kind of rotation you point to in Bringhurst's

    rotating while holding the nib flat to the paper, because the rotation serves
    to lift one side of the nib off the paper. Dragging the dry corner of the nib,
    the build up of ink behind the nib is eased and tails off as it clings after the

    writes above that the pointed flexible nib created a \"contrast manipulation paradigm
    that is fundamentally different in kind to that which came before.\"\r\n\r\nAnd
    John argues \"What you said was that you didn\u2019t see the influence of the

    made is that the influence is in the distinctive stroke contrast pattern.\"\r\n\r\nBut
    does the 'distinctive stroke contrast pattern' in Baskerville actually come from
    the flexible pointed nib, or are other sources equally or more important?\r\n\r\nAs
    Harry Carter argues in the earlier passage I quoted, the effort to find a geometrical
    'true' paradigm for the letters freed punch cutters to change their types from
    what the scribes had done. \r\n\r\nIs that kind of following a certain aesthetic
    ideal an important driving influence? Well the evidence? As James alludes to above
    the Romain du Roi type fifty years earlier already had some of the characteristics
    of Baskerville. And it was allegedly worked out using geometric models, as we
    can see here (image from Types of Typefaces):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Romain
    du Roi_5473.gif]\r\n\r\nHowever, the pointed flexible nib had been introduced
    [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nib_(pen)#Pointed_Nib|in the 17 century]], so perhaps
    this typeface was also just following the pointed nib pen, and the geometrical
    exercises were mere window dressing. \r\n\r\nThe problem with this theory can
    be seen in some of Albrecht D\xFCrer's drawings of letters:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Durer
    C_3592.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Durer D_3897.gif]\r\n\r\nHere
    D\xFCrer does both vertically stressed characters and 'old style'. And he is quite
    conscious that the first, vertical stress letters violate the models of the broad
    pen. He writes in the description of the second 'C', \"and, as though made with
    a pen, let the descending stroke be heavier than the ascending.\"\r\n\r\nNote
    that the serifs are also more pointed than in any pen script, and they are also,
    in the H, I, etc, symmetrical. \r\n\r\nNow D\xFCrer did these engravings in 1525,
    so that is long before the flexible pointed nib was generally used. My own conclusion
    is that Harry Carter is right about there being a freedom to pursue new ideals
    not derived from writing. And those explorations eventually to the Romain du Roi
    and to Baskerville's work. \r\n\r\nAs a coda to this, let me return to the typographic
    engravings of Bickham. The fact that these drawings do not display very prominently
    some of the characteristic uses of the flexible pointed nib shown in the cursive
    writing indicates to me that these drawings are heavily influenced by type. Nevertheless,
    the  p in the top picture, for example, shows the presence of the flexible pointed
    pen in the fairly uniform, fine line arching into the stem above and below. However,
    in Baskerville, (at least in modern interpretations, and I think I see the same
    in the small sample above) there is more tapering, characteristic of earlier type,
    including Caslon, rather than writing. \r\n\r\nThese engravings of pen made roman
    letters are not so much writing as careful drawings that show the marked influence
    of type, and which try to work out ideas that go back to D\xFCrer, and probably
    earlier. This is not to deny that pointed nib makes a contribution by facilitating
    the exploration, but there is a lot besides writing going on. \r\n\r\nTomorrow:

    that the split nib, via the lettering of the contemporary writing masters -- including

    the typeface, you would say Baskerville. I'll post a photo shortly.\r\n\r\n*   *
    \  *\r\n\r\nIf you are going to introduce the Roman du Roi, then I would say that
    we have to start paying attention to French writing masters as well as English
    ones. Just as you can't ignore what English writing masters were producing in
    the decades before Baskerville's types, you can't triumphantly point to the precedence
    of the Roman du Roi without taking into account what French writing masters were
    producing in the decades before it was devised. Thankfully, we happen to have
    one of the the foremost authorities on the Roman du Roi reading this discussion.
    Thankfully, also, I happen to have his book. Page 32 shows 'Devises pour les tapisseries
    du Roi, 1668.... la calligraphie est vraisemblablement de Jarry'. Do I need to
    say that it shows essentially the style of the Roman du Roi type, written with
    a split nib pen, thirty years before the cutting of the typeface?\r\n\r\n*   *
    \  *\r\n\r\nPace Harry Carter, D\xFCrer's constructed letters, like the numerous
    other renaissance exercises in attempting to devise or prove a geometric basis
    for roman capitals, exist entirely outside the mainstream of text production.
    They have nothing to do with the making of text, either in manuscript or in type.
    \r\n\r\n<em>As Harry Carter argues in the earlier passage I quoted, the effort
    to find a geometrical \u2019true\u2019 paradigm for the letters freed punch cutters
    to change their types from what the scribes had done.</em>\r\n\r\nIt's a nice
    idea, but I don't think there is visual evidence to back it up. Punchcutters are
    providing types to produce text, within text cultures. The theoretical and conceptual
    exercises of artists, accountants, and varied other people who dabbled in the
    geometric construction of letters seems to me to have had remarkably little influence
    on the development of typographic letters. This isn't surprising, because such
    exercises had remarkably little impact on the contemporary text culture.\r\n\r\nWhat
    D\xFCrer and other letter-constructors were trying to do was to establish a geometric
    basis for the classical roman capitals. That is, they were taking something that
    already existed, and trying to map it to various kinds of geometries to see how
    well it fit and to iron out suspected non-rational inconsistencies. I think the
    committee and draughtmen responsible for the famous engraved Roman du Roi plates
    were engaged in the same kind of exercise: taking the kind of letters being written
    by master scribes like Nicolas Jarry -- employed in the service of the same king
    as the makers of the Roman du Roi --, fitting them within a grid, and imposing
    geometries on the construction of details. In the process, they rationalised many
    aspects of the construction. What is interesting, of course, and oft remarked
    on, is that Grandjean's actual type does not follow these engraved plates. It
    is, in fact, very close to Jarry's 'calligraphie'. Why? <em>Because that's the
    contemporary text culture.</em>"

  body: "The conclusion of my version of the story is that printers type is both derivative
    of writing, and a deliberate departure from writing in an effort to increase readability.
    \r\n\r\nThe movement away from what is natural in writing starts even with scribes.
    When people write naturally, they write in more cursive, flowing styles, with
    slant. Scribes were producing text for reading, and made hands that are more unnatural
    to write--being more upright for example--but easier to read. \r\n\r\nThe creators
    of the printer's type that became dominant in latin script--Jenson and Griffo--took
    this process a step further. They not only made the letters more upright and more
    symmetrical, but were willing to violate the rules of the broad pen, and change
    relative weights and the nature of joins to get more even color and higher readability.
    \r\n\r\nIn the case of Baskerville, we see a strong tendency to more simple geometrical
    shapes. He is not just increasing contrast, but having more circular arches in
    the mn, for example. That these are more circular reflects the neo-Classical arch--as
    Bringhurst notes--and not only writing influences. It may well reflect also a
    search from before the time of D\xFCrer for 'ideal' shapes and proportions. Since
    Baskerville says specifically that his goal is \"true proportions\"--a phrase
    reminiscent of D\xFCrer's \"just shaping of letters\"--I also think it likely
    that his shapes are influenced by this concept of a certain ideal, not derived
    from writing, but to which writing can aspire, and type more successfully achieve.
    \  \r\n\r\nIf we look at the C from Bickham (taken from above), Baskerville (from
    the Prayer book image) and Caslon (scanned from Caslon's Great Primer), we have
    some of the story:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bickham, Baskerville,
    Caslon_5009.gif]\r\n\r\nWhat I see here is Baskerville being influenced by both:
    following the greater contrast from the writing (actually engraving), but also
    following the geometrically more simple, rigid and symmetrical form taken from
    type, and specifically Caslon. (Had I scanned a larger size of Caslon, you would
    see more higher contrast and closer resemblance to Baskerville.) We also see a
    formal balance that seems to owe a lot to pushing toward an imagined ideal architype
    of letters, and not one that simply follows and regularizes writing--even the
    most typographic of writing. \r\n\r\n>The fact remains that you can\u2019t produce
    Baskerville\u2019s letters using any other writing implement but a split nib.\r\n\r\nYou
    can't produce them by the pointed nib either, and can only come close laboriously.
    You can produce them by drawing, or by cutting them in punches, which is how they
    were in fact produced. The question is whether the inspiration was simply writing,
    or also type and ideal shapes. "

    You seem to assume that writing that is cursive, attached, with slant is somehow
    more 'natural' than writing that is formal, unconnected and upright. This has
    nothing to do with one form being more 'natural' than the other: it is simply
    a question of speed. Almost all mature manuscript text cultures produce two main
    styles of lettering: a formal book hand that is written slowly, often employing
    a greater number of strokes to form each letter, and a faster cursive hand in
    which the pen is lifted less often; slant and horizontal compression are results
    of increased speed. To my knowledge, the more slowly written formal book hand
    <em>always</em> precedes the cursive hand chronologically. If you study palaeography,
    this is one of the first things you notice, and you see it repeated again and
    again in different cultures and scripts. Speed, far from being more natural, only
    comes with experience.\r\n\r\n<em>In the case of Baskerville, we see a strong
    tendency to more simple geometrical shapes. He is not just increasing contrast,

    influences.</em>\r\n\r\nBut the round arch and the more circular forms of e.g.
    Shelley's capitals are part of the same neo-classical moment. There is a whole
    intellectual and artistic culture converging in ideas about classical proportion
    and beauty, and this is shaping the particular text culture and creating the need
    for neo-classical types. What is interesting is that this need is first met by
    the writing masters, who are essentially 'writing typefaces' up to four decades
    before Baskerville is having them cut in metal. Why are they doing this? Because
    the typeface for the emerging text culture does not exist yet, so they have to
    write it.\r\n\r\nI don't think there can, in fact, be any question that Baskerville's
    inspiration was the kind of formal letter being written by his fellow writing
    masters. Indeed, these letters are basically the spec for his types. The interesting
    question is not whether Baskerville looked to Caslon, but what typefaces someone
    like George Shelley was looking at, since Caslon had not made his types when Shelley
    was writing the shapes that Baskerville would translate into metal. One can assume
    that Shelley and other writing masters were familiar with the imported types that
    inspired Caslon, but it seems to me that they're not so much responding to specific
    typefaces as they are to an idea of typographical letterforms -- formal, regular,
    adaptable to a range of sizes -- and then creating what they think the neo-classical
    form of those letters should look like. I don't think it would have made much
    difference to the result if they had looked at Griffo's types, Garamond's or de
    Walpergen's, because the same basic qualities of 'typeness' can be derived from
    any of them: what matters is how to embody those qualities in letters that reflect
    the neo-classical text culture. This is what George Shelley does as early as 1709,
    and by the time John Handy cuts Baskerville's types at mid-century, the style
    has become part of the standard repertoire of the English scribe.\r\n\r\n<em>It

    forms that provides the very obvious model for Baskerville's types. That is 'the
    process leading to Baskerville'. And that translation involves devising ways to
    create formal roman letters with the primary writing tool of the day such as will
    harmonise with the other script styles in contemporary use. That it took the better
    part of half a century for those letters to find their way in to type is testimony
    to the relative conservatism of the printing and typography trades. You can make
    a case that Caslon was also exploring these ideas of neo-classical proportion,
    but it seems to me very difficult to separate out such a notion from the basic
    inheritance of his Dutch models and from the many inconsistencies of his types.
    Writing masters like Shelley did a much more convincing job of giving form to
    these ideas, and that surely consistutes the 'room for improvement' that Baskerville
    saw.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not agreeing about 'readability principles' because I'm not
    convinced that there is a significant difference in readability between type and
    a carefully written formal book hand -- including those many models of formal
    book hand in various scripts that were not adapted to typography -- that is ascribable
    to anything other than regularity. The adaptations and modifications found in
    typographic letterforms are explainable relative to scale and the physics of impression.
    It is easier to make small text with type than with a pen, and hence more economical
    in material terms (it uses less paper), and these letters benefit from modications
    to proportions and details that make them legible at these small sizes. So you
    can say that small type is easier to read than an equivalent size of written text,
    but can you say the same thing about type that is the same size as typical manuscript
    text? There doesn't seem to be evidence that small text is easier to read than
    larger text. Baskerville's text, of course, tends to be quite large and I'd much
    rather read his Milton than any number of typical modern editions.\r\n\r\nBetween
    D\xFCrer and neo-classicism is the wide expanse of the mannerist, baroque and
    rococo periods. The obsession with proportion in the neo-classical movement was
    not a direct continuation of the renaissance investigations of people like D\xFCrer,
    but a starting again."

    work on Henk Krijger\u2019s Raffia Initials, I needed seven \u2018referential
    frames' to say what needed saying about them. Some of them related to construction,
    some to curve structure, some to contrast, some to organic form.\r\n\r\nSome of
    the things that Baskerville is a meeting place for are:\r\n1) awareness of the
    contrast type native to writing with the flexible-nibbed pointed pen;\r\n2) awareness
    of how the contrast type native to the broad-nibbed pen was formalized in the

    by the mannersists and proto-baroque;\r\n4) a preference for 'classical'  or \u2018just\u2019
    proportions.\r\n\r\nBut the point is, or so it seems to me, that the foundational
    \u2018norm-violation\u201D of the baskerville, fournier, didot and bodoni types
    is the reliance of their contrast styling on a new and fundamentally different
    contrast scheme. That contrast scheme is characterized by expansion, and it is
    native to writing with the flexible-nibbed pointed pen, whatever the actual historical
    details of it's transition or fine tuning in roman letters.  And the contrast
    is in a way, written over the older contrast type. (Foundational, in this context
    means: what makes these types genotypically distinct. These types were \u2018strong
    departures\u2019 from what came before.)\r\n\r\nAlso, how Baskerville came to
    his application of the contrast scheme (that he came to know from the inside out,

    the model books (which might also have a complicated relation to actual writing).\r\n\r\nI

    James Mosley's facsimile edition and commentary on the 1766 specimen booklet.
    Below is ITC New Caslon.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Baskerville
    and Caslon_6601.gif]\r\n\r\nAs to the difference between the two C's I really
    don't see that Baskerville is that different, particularly as far as how the curves
    are handled. The arches on the m are to me the decisive difference, but here it
    seems that the desire for high contrast and the circular arches (inside and out)
    may be as much an influence as the ductus of the pointed pen. If you tried to
    draw this letter with a broad pen held vertically, you could pretty much get it,
    I am guessing, except for the left part of the arch. But these tapers in joins
    are in any case generally handled in type differently than the broad pen, including
    in Caslon. And even Baskerville's m has a gradual taper, which is more traditional
    than the long fairly uniform curvy thin strokes, as in the Bickham N above. \r\n\r\nSo
    did having the pointed pen to work out the shape help it? Yes. But the neo-classic

    part of roman type is that it is highly readable, so there might have been a tacit
    influence there.  But mainly he was striving for a much cleaner, more elegant
    look than Caslon. As you know, he was an innovator in inks, paper and printing
    in an effort to get the cleaner look. The type face was only part of the story. "

    century. Earlier, that is, than both Baskerville <em>and</em> Caslon. What I now

    models that provided the specific context of typography in England, and the general
    context provided by neo-classicism, particularly as explored and expressed in
    the work of the writing masters. To visualise this, you need to put alongside
    your big <em>C</em> and <em>m</em> images from Caslon and Baskerville the same
    letters from Shelley's 'French Cannon' of 1715. Baskerville's types are, of course,
    much closer overall to Shelley's forms than Caslon's, but I think the comparison
    suggests that Caslon was trying to introduce elements of the new neo-classical
    letterforms into his types while still staying true to his Dutch models. Indeed,
    I suspect that this observation might explain many of the apparent inconsistencies
    in Caslon's types. Again referring back to Baskerville's comments re. Caslon,
    one might define the 'room for improvement' as all the remaining traces of the
    Dutch oldstyle in Caslon's types. That he didn't dismiss Caslon's types completely
    indicates that he recognised the interposed neo-classical features among the oldstyle;

    that the contemporary writing masters produced with those pointed pens. There
    are concepts of proportion that one might derive from neo-classical treatises
    on art and architecture, but those don't lead you to the specific forms of Baskerville's
    types."

  body: ">does it help for me to say that what is at issue is not of the order of
    phenotypical similarity, but of genotypical change?\r\n\r\nWell, yes. Since the
    same type of modulation of the stroke is in not only the mnhr but also the bdpq,
    and it is modulation more independent of change of direction in stroke, the pointed
    pen is more critical than I have conceded so far. The modulation of stroke in
    earlier type also violated the rules of the broad pen in its joins, but I admit
    not in the same way. \r\n\r\nJohn I think a lot of inconsistency in Caslon was,
    as Baskerville implies, because he was in a rush to get masses of work out the
    door. Here by 'inconsistency' am referring to things like variation in ascender
    height and x-height within the same face, and of variation in the relation of
    characters to one another--some wider or narrower in relation to others in different
    sizes. However, if Caslon could come on Typophile, I suspect he would defend himself
    by saying \"If it looks right it is right.\" I think he had a self confidence
    that even if it was not consistent, if it looked harmonious in his eyes, it was
    excellent. Now I don't think that is a full justification, as he has characters
    which are just bad. Still, I find it remarkable that he was able to make quite
    different characters in different sizes, and somehow they all look Caslon, and
    are impressive in spite of their inconsistencies. And in may be that inconsistency
    with harmony that helps give them their warmth and charm--and part of the difficulty
    in capturing their spirit in revivals. \r\n\r\nBy the way, another source of inconsistency,
    including in design, not only execution, may be that he had different models of
    type as a starting point for his types in different sizes. This James Mosley seems
    to indicate in his commentary on the specimen book of 1766. \r\n\r\nI remain unrepentant
    that Caslon was an important influence on Baskerville, but it would take a lot
    of work to try to prove it, scanning and comparing letter forms, and I won't be
    doing that. "

    spread letterforms to \"countries unfamiliar\". National hands became oppressed.\r\n\r\nAlso
    printing exploded the use of letterforms which were economical in space. Paper
    was very expensive. Mass reproduction by printers put great pressure on papermakers.
    One copy of a book produced by a scribe was negligible compared the hundreds produced
    by a printer of the same text. Economical letterforms became very important. In
    that sense printers influence was not so minimal. Consider that Aldus Manutius
    was the inventor of the pocket book. \r\n\r\n\"The Aldine Press revolutionized
    the production, accessibility, and use of the book. Founded by Aldus Manutius

    the development of the modern book, including italic type and the smaller, pocket-sized
    volume. By putting the Greek and Latin classics in a form that everyone could
    afford, it revolutionized scholarship: the uniform Aldine texts made comparison
    and collation universally available, and they were used in schools.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
    yes, as I said, printers owed great debt to the previous work of scribes."

    <em>Natural Writing in all the Hands, with Variety of Ornament</em> of 1709. The
    titles of these writing manuals, which were really forms of advertising for the
    services or tuition of the writing master, often give a good indication of how
    the writers thought of what they produced. Given Bill's comment above about 'natural'
    writing, Shelley's title is particularly apposite. He is demonstrating his facility
    with 'all the hands', and clearly he counts the formal, pseudo-typographic letters
    to be among the contemporary hands that are expected to be written 'naturally'
    by a man of his profession.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Shelley1709a_4739.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    here is a detail. It is worth relating his back to Shelley's 'French Cannon' (approx.
    48pt) as illustrated by James earlier in this thread, about which it was suggested,
    reasonably, that these were 'built up' or drawn letters, rather than written.
    In this image you see the same forms as written, at about 15pt I think (I've lost

    such a strong and individual style, it just stamps everything he touches.\"\r\n\r\nA
    valuable comparison to the \"sound\" of Caslon's work.\r\n\r\nCaslon did not cut
    punches from patterns. Patterns were used in the much later mechanical punch cutting
    innovations, not by hand punch cutters. Drawings were, \"but not always\" used
    by punch cutters. Let me compare my own approach to typographical design to that
    of Jim Rimmer's. Jim would draw his page with the very spirit and feeling of his
    finished product. I never used drawings (layouts) I designed in the type stick,
    or with fleurons on a galley. If I do say myself, and I do, typographical compositions
    found in my stick were \"not too shabby\"\r\n\r\nIt is unknown, some even have
    doubts, including myself, that Caslon began with drawings. In fact the Caslon
    Foundry, or Foundery, if you prefer, which I do, survived into the twentieth century
    with punches and matrices intact. But no sign of drawings to my knowledge, and
    I asked the Caslon Foundery. They offered this very theory.\r\n\r\nThat is important
    hear-say evidence drawing me towards significant doubt that Caslon worked from
    master drawings.\r\n\r\nAlso, Caslon was not so much cutting a \"type face\" as
    he was a \"type size\". Caslon had a very natural gift for intuitive optical scaling.
    Some characters, Italic \"&\" show great departures. One may also note the upper-case
    \"A\" changing in design in the original Caslon. Then start looking closely at
    the other characters.\r\n\r\nHowever all sizes, represent the work of Caslon.
    All have the same sound, but no two sizes are identical.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I
    believe Baskervilled was greatly influenced by Caslon. However the reasons for
    \"non slavish imitation\" has yet to be discussed.\r\n\r\nIn 1723 Baskervill taught
    writing and became a skilled engraver of tombstones. Caslon was a gun lock engraver,
    and importantly a bookbinding tool stamping engraver. In other words Caslon was
    a skilled punchcutter before beginning his business endeavor. Although Baskerville
    and Caslon were engaged in remotely similar industries they possessed very different
    disciplines. So one should anticipate notable differences in spite of Baskerville's
    stated emulation.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the word \"emulate\" mentioned previously,
    the one that both John and William have sparred with.\r\n\r\nOne of the early
    definitions of emulation is to: (Oxford) \"Try to equal or excel; rival;\". \r\n\r\nA
    further consideration is the two distinctly different personalities,\r\n\r\nBaskerville:
    \"He invented his own lustrous, uniquely black, opaque ink; he was the first to
    exploit commercially James Whatman\u2019s invention of wove paper, which was much
    smoother than the traditional laid paper; and he modified the printing process
    by using heated copper cylinders to dry the ink before it had time to soak too
    far into the paper. All of these innovations enabled Baskerville to produce printed
    work of an elegance, crispness and clarity never seen before.\"\r\n\r\nBaskerville
    was a very inventive book printer not so much a type founder. Baskerville did
    not emulated Caslon's business model. While Baskerville's workmanship was excellent
    \"the trade not so excellent\", or should I say \"fussy\". The trade had \"work
    to do\" and whiskey to drink. \r\n\r\nCaslon was a type founder selling to the
    trade, and sell he did. His foundery produced Caslon Old Face for well over two
    hundred years. I sold and set tons of Caslon Oldstyle over the years, not a pound
    or a setting of Baskerville although I offered both.\r\n\r\nBaskerville I find
    more of a curio typeface and compare it with my interest with souvenir spoons.
    I hate souvenir spoons."

    calligraphy from 1605 and an engraving of the same piece. [I have reduced their
    size to fit in the Typophile window.] \r\n\r\nHere is the original handwriting
    of Jan van den Velde, \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Velde  manuscript

    also refers me to his last chapters in Letterletter, where he discusses Mannerist
    writers and the engraving of their writing. Both he and scholar Amy N. Worthen,
    whom he quotes at length, argue, convincingly, that engraving did not influence
    writing, but the other way around. \r\n\r\nThe question of whether changes in
    aesthetic ideals were driving changes in writing and writing instruments is still
    an open one, at least for me. \r\n\r\nAs to the specific issue of the influence
    of the flexible, pointed pen on Baskerville, as I have said, I am now convinced
    my initial idea about Baskerville in this thread was wrong. Furthermore, Gerald
    Giampa makes a good point that Baskerville may have meant by 'emulate' that he
    was trying to equal or excel Caslon, not that he was imitating him.  \r\n\r\nAs
    to the influence of the typographic ideal on Baskerville, I do think that this
    is still sound. I don't think that the typographic writing of Shelley and Bickham
    posted by John could have ever been done had not Jenson and Griffo earlier established
    a specifically typographic look for roman type. This includes the uprightness,
    regularity of design, and violation of broad pen rules for the sake of greater
    evenness of color.  \r\n\r\nBaskerville does use the pointed pen line in his arches
    and round to stem joins, but he introduces these changes in line with restraint,
    and in the service of a very rigid, upright design that breathes the spirit of
    past roman type. John and James may not like the term 'transitional', and it is
    in a way unfair to Baskerville as he was not fumbling toward a different solution,
    but realizing his own coherent ideas. Nevertheless, compared to Didot and Bodoni,
    the use of the pointed pen line--changes in expansion largely independent from
    direction--Baskerville is a lot more restrained and limited. In that sense it
    seem to me fair to say that Baskerville is a transition to those who used the
    expansion-contraction line more fully in their types.  "

  body: ">not all of them effected fundamental differences in the basic shape-logic
    of the strokes.\r\n\r\nYes, but what drove that change? In the discussion of Mannerist
    writing Gerrit Noordzij says in Letterletter that the mannerist pen was broad,
    but flexible. I'm guessing that this was a step to the pointed, flexible pen.
    From what I read, it seems one could make all of these--broad, mannerist and pointed--from
    a goose feather and a pen knife. So there wasn't any technical limitation as to
    why people didn't create and use this kind of pen earlier. Did they modify the
    pens because they wanted a more florid, dramatic style? Was this related to changes
    in the decorative arts generally? I would guess 'yes'. \r\n\r\nAnd if the pen
    is driving everything, why was there was a reaction against the high-contrast
    vertical stress types toward the end of the nineteenth century? It is said that
    the publication of Lady Willoughby's Diary, the first revival of Caslon, and of
    any type, was a sensation in 1844. Many people found it more readable than the
    high contrast types that had come to dominate printing. and by the end of the
    century in English speaking countries there was a tide of 'old styles' that continued
    into the 1930s. \r\n\r\nAnd you had Edward Johnston taking up the broad pen in
    England, IIRC, and doing old, pre-flexible pen writing. And you had Morris reviving
    Jenson, or trying to. Was everyone suddenly forced to write with a broad pen and
    then designers helplessly followed? No. But society was changing--first the industrial
    revolution, and then reaction to its bad side.  \r\n\r\nThe pen was an important
    part of the story, but was type design a prisoner of the history of the pen? I
    really don't think that's tenable, because writing is part of a broader culture--visual,
    technological, social, and the change in writing instruments are themselves part
    of that. \r\n\r\nFor example, one of the technical changes was Baskerville's improvements
    of inks and printing methods. Again, I don't know, but I would guess that this
    did help inspire Bodoni and Didot to do what they did *in type*. For the pen's
    ductus didn't change between Baskerville and Bodoni, so far as I have heard--and
    I'm sure John will correct me if I'm wrong!"

  body: "Bill, as Peter says, no one is claiming that the pen, per se, drives everything.
    But in the area of text creation, within cultures in which large amounts of documents
    were being written rather than typeset, writing tended to set the aesthetic agenda
    for text because it has the advantages of speed and economy, i.e. writing could
    respond to and express changes in fashion and cultural tastes more quickly than
    typography. I think James' point about the importance of manuscript document production
    to the imperial project of 18th Century England creating a situation in which
    the writing masters could directly influence the direction of the typographic
    culture is well made. [How's that for an unpunctuated sentence!]\r\n\r\nIt is
    quite typical for aesthetic movements to become increasingly virtuoso and extreme
    in their expressions, eventually prompting reaction and either revolutionary developments
    or revivals of previous aesthetic. Both revolution and revival happened in response
    to the decline of neo-classicism into the hackneyed art of the academy and the
    decreasing quality of industrial production. In painting, for example, the reaction
    was largely revolutionary -- impressionism, pos-impressionism, cubism --, excepting
    the Preraphaelites (who were, of course, associated with William Morris); in the
    text culture the reaction was revivalist and, as you note yourself, it involved
    equivalent revivals in both writing and typography, as both returned to renaissance
    models.\r\n\r\nThe Caslon revival of the mid-19th Century is a kind of odd blip:
    a sign of dissatisfaction with what was happening in the increasingly high-contrast
    types, but not a wholesale programme of reform of the text culture as undertaken
    at the end of the century by Johnston, Morris, Cobden Sanderson, et al (which
    also, of course, had equivalents in other countries around the same time, indicating
    a much broader cultural shift than printing some books in Caslon). Much Victorian
    typography continued to be bad after 1844, and the so-called Caslon revival doesn't
    seem to me to have been particularly broad. I recently read a novel published
    in the 1870s with two narrow columns of justified 9pt scotch roman on each page.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of the Caslon revival, which was begun by Charles Whittingham's Chiswick Press,
    you should try to find something printed in Caslon by the Chiswick Press from
    the first few years of the 20th century. The type is a large Caslon heavily overinked
    and sunk deeply into thick rag paper in emulation of the new styles made popular
    by the Kelmscott and Ashendene presses.\r\n\r\nBy the way, yes you can cut the
    shape of a pointed split nib in a feather quill, but it won't last very long.
    The fibres of the feather are nicely flexible, but they don't rebound well and
    the finer they are cut the weaker they become: the two sides of the split will
    splay and the pen will be useless. Steel provides the ideal combination of flexibility,
    strength and durability."

  body: "John, you write \"no one is claiming that the pen, per se, drives everything.\"\r\n\r\nThat
    may be an exaggeration of Gerrit Noordzij's view, but is only a slight exaggeration.
    His view is clearest in a summary article, \"The Shape of the Stroke\", which
    Peter was kind enough to send me some time ago. It contains information also in
    Noordzij's book \"The Stroke\", which as you know Peter translated--thanks Peter!
    It is particularly concise in expressing Noordzij's views. Here is the abstract:\r\n\r\n**\r\n1.
    Design Shapes Human Life.\r\n2. A civilization is a mode of design.\r\n3. The
    primitive artifact (the 'DNA' of a civilization) is the single stroke of writing.
    \r\n4. The stroke is a shape. \r\n5. It is defined by a description of its two
    dimensions.\r\n** \r\n\r\nThe first sentence of the first section: \r\n\r\n<em>\"Western
    civilization is the cultural society which is communicating in Western writing.\"</em>
    (Italics are Noordzij's.) And then at the end of that paragraph he repeats: \"Writing
    is the cultural paradigm.\" And note that writing and print are not the same thing
    for Noordzij. \r\n\r\nMy reading of this, which I think is a reasonable interpretation,
    is that western civilization hangs on the stroke of the pen. This is reinforced
    by Noordzij's dark forebodings that Western civilization is threatened by not
    teaching children handwriting. \r\n\r\nThis is what I am objecting to as exaggerated.
    I think that since the introduction of printing, and the achievements of Jenson
    and Griffo in readability of type, changes in handwriting have been stylistic
    changes that have reflected, rather than fundamentally changed the culture. Printing
    has been central to Western culture since then, and writing important, but increasingly
    less so since the introduction of the typewriter. Notice \"type\" writer. \r\n\r\nTo
    take the analogy of the dog wagging the tail, not the other way around: Changes
    in writing have been the tail of the dog of larger cultural changes. The tail
    of writing styles have not been wagging the dog of culture. This is not true of
    printing: printing was and is the dog, changing civilization. And now printing
    (not writing!) on the screen is a new cultural force. \r\n\r\nSo John, do you
    think I am misreading Noordzij? Do you agree with everything he writes above as
    not exaggerating the importance of hand writing? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

    describes his pedagogical method: which is to present seemingly absolute statements
    (laws) as a starting point for exploration and discussion. The aside I want to
    make is to drag in Plato, Popper and Gadamer. Popper considers Plato one of the
    primary enemies of the open society, because he reads <em>The Republic</em>, as
    many others have done, as a sociopolitical programme. That is, he reads it as
    a philosophical treatise on government, akin to many subsequent treatises in the
    history of western political thought. Gadamer, though, teaching classical philology
    during the Nazi period because it was safer than philosophy, comes to the realisation
    that the Platonic dialogues have to be seen in the context of the Platonic academy,
    i.e. not as treatises but as teaching aids, as works that were composed as a basis
    for discussion. Plato isn't laying out a programme of ideal government, he's teaching,
    by example of dialogue, how to talk about government. Similarly, I don't think
    Noordzij's writings should be separated from Noordzij's teaching, and should also
    be seen in the context of his pedagogical method. I have little doubt that Noordzij
    considers teaching more important that writing (in the authorial sense), and the

    is a mode of design\u201D you have to look at what he does. \r\n\r\nWhat Noordzij
    does is define civiliztions, the cultures that exist within them, their beginings

    to the stroke. So for instance \u2018his\u2019 \u201CMiddle Ages\u201D \u201Cbegin
    in the 7th century when an Irish scribe invented the word,\u201D and he defines
    the Middle Ages as the period of increasing contrast. \r\n\r\nAccording to Noordzij,
    \u201Cthe new unit of writing could be strengthened by reducing the white shapes
    between the letters which demanded a corresponding reduction of the white shapes
    within the letters. During the Middle Ages the size of the letters in respect
    to the width of the pen was gradually reduced.\u201D He continues: \u201CI have
    never found something like a mediaeval mood which fosters this process. It is
    more sensible to understand <em>Middle Ages</em> as the name of this process.\r\n\r\nNoordzij
    does the same kind of thing for other epochs as well, up until the 20th century.

    the picture of his father is more representative than his interests and books.
    \r\n\r\nThat clarifies in what sense Noordzij thing that \"writing is the cultural
    paradigm.\" It is a representative, and reveals essential characteristics of a
    culture--rather than creating them. \r\n\r\nThat may be true, but I still have
    a problem with writing being \"the\" cultural paradigm. Confucius said something
    like: \"Show me the dance and music of a culture, and I will tell you its character.\"
    \ And he was right. \r\n\r\nThe larger point is that the current cultural products
    of a society at any given time to a remarkable extent share the same 'DNA'. In
    the visual arts, for example, you see a resonance between architecture and letters.
    \r\n\r\nIt is true that some cultural products are most characteristic of a culture
    at a given time. In this respect, if you wanted to have a graphic representative
    of Europe in 1500, I think it would not be scribal hand writing, but a printed
    page of Aldus. And the departures of type from hand writing would be a small but
    not insignificant part of that paradigm.  \r\n\r\n"

    is no doubt that this urge towards generalization gave the art history confined

    critics learnt in this way to see in a pointed shoe what they were accustomed
    to seeing in a cathedral, or to see in a cathedral what a shoe could perhaps have
    told them, the more they lost sight of the elementary fact that a shoe is something
    slips on to go outside, whereas a cathedral is a place one goes into to pray.
    And who would deny that this, so to speak, pre-artistic functional differentiation
    constituting the essential different between two objects, arising from man's use
    of different tools for distinct purposes, is a factor which plays a decisive part

    the type resembles latter type in the tricks to get more even rhythm and color.
    \r\n\r\nGerrit Noordzij in Letterletter does acknowledge some change in Jenson
    from the scribal hand. However, he ascribes this to what is cut \"more easily\"
    in a punch (p. 96).  Here is the nub of my disagreement. I suspect that was was
    going on, at least by the time of Griffo, is deliberate changes to achieve a purpose
    of higher readability than what the scribes achieved. Furthermore, this movement
    away from writing continued, I suspect, up to at least Garamond. \r\n\r\nIn order
    to make this case I will have to get high resolution scans, which I don't have
    time to do now. However, that movement away from the scribal hand is where I suspect
    Noordzij's story--and John Hudson's has an important missing theme. \r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I broke down and picked up a pointed, flexible steel pen and dipped it
    in ink and tried to draw an approximation of a Baskerville 'n'. I was taken aback
    that the pen did drew pretty much exactly Baskerville's line. \r\n\r\nThe source
    of my blunder on this is that I was thinking of the pointed pen as the 'generalized
    pen' that Noordzij describes, with translation, rotation and expansion in any
    direction. But the pointed pen is more restricted in how it draws on up strokes
    and side strokes. So it has a characteristic stroke that I wasn't aware of. Or
    as John Hudson put it--rather ungenerously--that I was 'blind' to. Thus Baskerville
    didn't just violate the broad pen, he violated it in a way that is characteristic
    of the pointed, flexible pen. "

    large pictures of Jenson and Griffo's type. However, he does have a big picture
    of Garamond's type, which I think will suffice to make my point. Here it is, a
    fresh printing type made from Garamond's original matrices of the Gros Canon size:\r\n\r\n
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Garamond Gros Canon 595 px_3923.gif]\r\n\r\nWhat
    we can see here is the kind of optical correction that is [[http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.2a/2.3.2.06.illusion.htm|documented
    here]] by Briem. The O overshoots compared to the H. That might have been done
    by scribes, but not the increase in the weight of the vertical curve of the D
    compared to the stem of the D. If it were drawn by a pen of fixed width, the horizontal
    width of the D curve would be the same as the stem. \r\n\r\nAlso the diagonals
    don't follow 'pen' rules. If the pen were held at a fixed angle, corresponding
    to the slope of the head serifs, then the diagonals would be thicker. But the
    fat diagonal on the x is about the same as the vertical of the h, not thicker.
    (That's not documented by Briem, but is common in type.) And the Z and z have
    the stress reversed from what a written Z would have with the pen held at a constant
    angle--a thick, not a thin. The bottom curve on the c and c look thicker than
    the horizontal at mid-height, but it they are actually the same, not thicker.
    They rely on optical illusion to get the appearance of thickness. \r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    the small, delicate the serifs also may not follow what can be done with the pen,
    but are rescaled because of the designer's ideas, not the pen. \r\n\r\nAlso Noordzij
    himself notes that Garamond may have occasionally curved his outside corners in
    larger sizes, and that may have been \"intended to look like enlargings of the
    <em>printed</em> small sizes.\" (Noordzij's emphasis)\r\n\r\nGaramond may have
    been influenced by the rising mannerist tide, though Bringhurst, at least, categorizes
    him as \"high Renaissance,\" not mannerist. \r\n\r\nPeter, you may call this \"regularization\"
    and may debate whether it was done for aesthetic or readability reasons. My point
    is that whatever the reason it violates pen rules, and is a critical departure
    from the pen, in favor of the eye. \r\n\r\nAnother important factor here is spacing
    and width of characters. If you look at the example of formal humanist writing
    that John posted on Sept. 23, above, you will see that the spacing and the width
    of characters varies continually. If you look at Jenson or Griffo, as well as
    Garamond, there is a strikingly different rhythm. Part of this was no doubt that
    they had to decide on one width for all the 'n's, for example. And in general
    there had to be sufficient space to put one piece of type next to the other, with
    a wide enough 'beard' to keep the type physically strong. But these physical constraints
    I think pushed them to creatively think: what are the best proportions and spacing
    for the lower case? And here they came up with a pattern that was not an imitation
    of writing but decisively different and more readable. \r\n\r\nMy overall point
    here is not that Noordzij is wrong about the huge influence of the pen. I acknowledged
    his innovative insights at the beginning, and now I see he is even more right
    than I realized earlier. However, he does neglect another important part of the
    story, which is specifically typographic, and is different from or actually contradicts
    the patterns of the pen writing. These I have sketched a little bit of here.    \r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nI think 'yes'. \r\n\r\nI would have to get a broad pen and try to write
    over Garamond to test it out properly. But I don't see how you can get a wider
    vertical arch on the D than the stem of the D by translation, and no rotation
    or expansion. You will have to do rotation, at the very least, and then the question
    would be, why are you doing it, when they didn't before? Optically a fatter arch
    balances better with a vertical stem. Why ignore that as a driving factor? It
    also ends up with more even color as a result, which, carried through systematically,
    is better for readability. \r\n\r\nBut the spacing issues don't have to do with
    the 'ductus' anyway. The point is, Noordzij's categories of 'ductus' aren't sufficient
    to capture important features of the development of type design. Visual features
    concerning optical balance, even color, spacing and rhythm are different variables,
    and are critical.\r\n\r\nNoordzij does have interesting insights into optical

    an \"underlying force\" (van Krimpen) in Garamond, but is contradicted by another
    force: the greater freedom of the punch cutter to please the reading eye more
    than the moving broad pen was able to. I never said the pen wasn't a force, just
    that there were other forces pushing away from its lines. You say that the changes

    an essential change. \r\n\r\nAnother way you can look at this is that there are
    two forces or paradigms at work: one the pattern set by the pen, and the other
    what pleases the reading eye. Noordzij rightly highlights the importance of one,
    but not the other, in the historical evolution of type design. You need both to

    to meet some aesthetic standards that even make text type less readable. Even

    it in a way that is characteristic of the pointed, flexible pen.</em>\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to me that saying that Baskerville 'violated the broad pen' implies a relationship
    to that implement that is absent not only from Baskerville's own work, as both
    a writing master and as a typographer/printer, but also absent -- with the exception
    of blackletter -- from the contemporary text creation culture. It makes almost
    as little sense as saying that he violated the Chinese brush or the Burmese stylus:
    the broad nib as a tool for the creation of text was alien to his culture and
    hadn't been widely used since before Baskerville's birth. And even if you want
    to say that he violated the latent, inherited translation stroke pattern in typographic
    letters, that still implies a relationship that I think is contradicted by the
    evidence.\r\n\r\nNow I think we need to look at what happens when a script is
    reduced to typography. Gerald already commented on some implications of this,
    including the typical loss of regional scripts (although this had already begun
    in the manuscript culture as early as Charlemagne's time, and some regional scripts
    either survived or were later revived, e.g. the Irish insular hand). But there
    is a more general case to be observed, which is that the norm for typographic
    letters derives from the canons of the contemporary formal book hand, but in the
    new medium undergoes a secondary canonisation. That is, the normative manuscript
    hand of a particular text culture becomes the normative typographic letter of
    <em>subsequent</em> text cultures. So in renaissance Italy, the humanist formal
    book hand and later the cursive hand become the normative forms of humanist typography,
    which eventually becomes <em>the</em> normative typographic form of Latin letters,
    supplanting previous styles such as the various blackletter and regional hands
    and admitting new styles derived from contemporary writing, such as Civilit\xE9,
    only as supplementary fashions. So the process of type design becomes the process
    of creating these normative letterforms in new ways, with different proportions,
    contrast and detailing, rather than the process of creating new styles of writing.
    But in the meantime, new styles of writing are being invented by writing masters
    and professional scribes, who are producing significant quantities of text in
    various kinds of documents, who are teaching new styles of fashionable handwriting
    to both children and adults, and who are publishing copy books and exemplars,
    all in response to broader developments in intellectual and cultural life. Meanwhile,
    in comparison, the norms of typographic letterforms develop hardly at all: they
    are locked in their original Italian humanist form. To the type designer and typographic
    historian, there is a rich development in the treatment of proportions, weights,
    serif treatment, etc. and the important development of the canon of typographic
    articulation through supplementary styles, italics, smallcaps, etc. But compared
    to the range of different writing styles developed during the same period, Latin
    typography remains largely static and the basic underlying forms of the letters
    remains frozen and continues to be frozen today. Indeed, we now associate the
    normative forms not only of our typography but of our alphabet with these particular
    historical shapes. We admit some variation in the forms of e.g. a and g, but most
    of the rest of the historical and regional variety of the Latin script is unknown
    to most people.\r\n\r\nWhat happens in the 18th century is that these typographic
    norms are re-intepreted in light of the principle tool of contemporary writing
    and its distinctive stroke pattern. This is done by writing masters first, and
    only some decades later by a 'type designer'. In stylistic terms, everything Baskerville
    needed to create his types is already there in Shelley's exemplars of 1709 and
    1715. By the 1750s, this kind of 'typographic writing', i.e. the normative typographic
    letterforms as written with a pen, has become part of the standard repertoire
    of the writing masters, and taking the next step of making it into a typeface
    is largely a financial and manufacturing issue. There are particular design considerations
    relating to the size of individual fonts, but that has been the case in typography
    since at least Griffo's time: the style of the new types was developed by writing
    them, as the documentary evidence shows. This may be a unique phenomenon in the
    history of typography: the development of a significant new style within the overall
    canon of typographic letterforms, i.e. not a new style of writing but a new way
    of making typographic shapes in a contemporary way, developed independently of
    the manufacture of type (something similar is happening in France at around the
    same time, but can probably be considered part of the same phenomenon, especially
    if one takes into account Fournier's enthusiasm for Baskerville's types)."

    all. I began my part in this discussion about Baskerville by insisting that printer's
    types be seen in the larger context of text creation that, in cultures with significant
    manuscript document production, has certain observable characteristics and influences
    that argue against the accuracy of any typocentric history. This isn't a statement
    only about 18th century England, but what happened there is particularly interesting
    because the model for the new types is so clearly established in a different medium,
    writing, prior to being implemented in type, and we have such good documentary
    evidence of this because of the social and economic importance of writing and
    the production so many copy books and exemplars.\r\n\r\nYes, the broad pen, i.e.
    the translation stroke pattern, is there in the imported printing types and in
    Caslon's types (although I think you did an admirable job, earlier in this discussion,
    of demonstrating influences of neo-classicism in some of Caslon's forms, whether
    that was your intention or not), but my point made earlier was that this left
    typography increasingly at odds with and out of step with the aesthetics of the
    text creation culture dominated by written, engraved and inscribed forms that
    were based on very different stroke patterns. And the strongest evidence of this
    domination is that there is, during half a century or more, no counter influence
    of these old fashioned types on any other area of text creation. That seems to
    me very significant.\r\n\r\nSo when you say that Baskerville 'violated the broad
    pen', i.e. broke with the translation stroke pattern, I think you are still imposing
    a typocentric view that doesn't fit with the evidence. The evidence suggests that
    Baskerville spent his whole life writing with a flexible split nib steel pen,
    that he became a writing master and practitioner of the various styles of writing
    and lettering associated with that pen, and that he later had two of these styles
    cut in type by John Handy. In order to 'violate the broad pen' he would have had
    to have had some engagement with the broad pen, and I just don't see it and I
    don't count reading books set in Caslon's types to constitute such an engagement.\r\n\r\nYou
    could argue reasonably, I think, that the first person or persons to write the
    normative typographic forms of Latin letters with a split nib 'violated the broad
    pen'. But that wasn't Baskerville, and you are unjustifiably privileging the act
    of cutting those letters in metal if you imply that Baskerville or Handy's achievement
    constitutes such violation but not George Shelley's, <em>four decades earlier.</em>\r\n\r\n"

    introduced alterations to what the first transpositions of writing into type produced.
    And they did so along several axis. \r\n\r\nThe first axis, I'll call the <em>optical-grammatical

    the alterations, it's things that appear when the small variations introduced
    by the human hand and physical tool are resolved into a workable amount of  standardized
    and co-ordinated widths, standardized heights (x-height, cap height, ascender
    height, descender depth) and standardized stroke proportions. This sets up a type-internal
    dynamic. And I think that's what you miss in Noordzij. The \u2018o\u2019 overshoot
    problem is of this sort, as is the incremental widening across the board of certain
    strokes.\r\n\r\nSmall variation in pressure, rotation, proportion is a thing of
    the hand, and over the space of a text produces a consistent texture. Constraining
    variations to absolute values \u2014 which the new technology presupposes \u2014
    allows optical issues of uneven colour and optical irregularities \u2014 <em>which
    aren't spontaneously evoked in an environment of random, small-incremental variation</em>
    \u2014 to assert themselves or obtrude.\r\n\r\n(The second axis I've tried to

    the dimension of evenness or unevenness of color stand out. To deal with it, by
    the time of Garamond, anyway, we have a *contradiction* of the broad pen in systematic
    ways, including, as I mentioned, the thinning of 'thick' diagonals and the expansion
    of vertical rounds compared to stems. But it goes way beyond this, and includes
    the weight of terminals, the shapes of letters, their relative widths etc.  \r\n\r\nYou

    the story through Garamond--then what I have described are contradictions to that
    pen. \r\n\r\nSure, if you change to a different pen of different width when you
    do a diagonal, or somehow rotate the pen at weird angles while writing the letter--you
    might get those uniform or thinner diagonals, though probably if you kept the
    pen on the paper it would mess up the stroke at vertexes while you rotate. And
    you'd have to switch or rotate the pen to get the wider arches too. Switching
    pens for heavier caps makes some sense, but not in the middle of a lower case
    letter, I think. \r\n\r\nA theoretical pen is irrelevant to causation in history,
    because it didn't exist and it didn't drive the historical development. \r\n\r\nI
    find Peter's analysis persuasive--that the inherent uniformity of repeating the
    same letter forms pushed type creators to make the changes I have written about.
    That way they were able to achieve better rhythm in letter widths and spacing,
    and more uniform color, enhancing easy and comfortable reading. And by the way
    not all were able to do it. As Harry Carter illustrates, W. de Spira's roman type
    failed to achieve that good typographic rhythm, and Jenson succeeded. And he thereby
    became a model for Griffo. There are typographic solutions to typographic problems,
    and these are not trivial, and not simply derivative from writing.  \r\n\r\nEarlier
    in this thread, having before my mind's eye Noordzij's theoretical pen--that can
    do translation, rotation, and expansion--caused me not to see Baskerville's arches
    as guided by the ductus of the pointed pen. The pointed pen is, however, a real
    pen and doesn't act the same way in down stroke, upstroke, and moving sideways,
    and so is decisively different from that theoretical pen. I only really fully
    understood that then when I picked up a pointed pen and wrote with it. Now I think
    you are making a different mistake, but due to the same cause--assuming a theoretical
    pen that didn't exist and didn't influence history.\r\n\r\nThe changes in pens
    did influence letter forms, as Noordzij explains. But other forces also influenced

    of the moving front -- the broad nib -- is constant throughout the stroke. Note:
    not necessarily constant across every stroke in every letter, but within each
    individual stroke. And my point is that where e.g. Garamond's letterforms differ
    from the scribal model on which the roman types were based they do so in ways
    that are consistent with the translation stroke pattern. This is why I say they
    are transcending the pen, not contradicting it: the logic of the stroke pattern
    is extended and applied independently of the model, but the strokes remain informed
    by the translation pattern, not by some other pattern.\r\n\r\n<em>A theoretical
    pen is irrelevant to causation in history, because it didn\u2019t exist and it

    knowing how the punchcutters thought about letterforms. But I don't think a theoretical
    pen, i.e. a theoretical understanding of the moving front such as Noordzij has
    developed, is necessary to applying the stroke pattern of particular writing implements
    systematically and independently of that pen. Type designers do this all the time,
    and stonecutters and woodblock cutters have been doing it much longer: you get
    a feel for a stroke model and how to apply it and, yes, also how to manipulate

    founders were \"non to pleased with  the longevity of Caslon's popularity\". They
    wanted to impose an \"import protection act\". The problem was that lead, and
    lead products were tariff free. The weasel factor came into play, the founders
    claimed that \"Caslon types were not lead\", that is why their type was so hard,
    not to mention, superior to American type products, therefore, \"subject to tariff\".
    In order for the Caslon Foundery to dispute this they had to demonstrate that
    their alloy was mainly composed of lead and \"disclose the alloy\"\r\n\r\nNaturally
    the Caslon Foundery's alloy was a closely guarded secret.\r\n\r\nSo you see, it

    products.\r\n\r\nEventually Caslon tried to get around this by licensing the typeface

    of writing formal roman letters with a broad nib (or a brush for that matter:
    you see the same thing in the Trajan letter). What it indicates is a double stroke:
    the pen comes down and then out towards one serif, then is lifted and placed back
    on the stem and brought down and out towards the other serif. In the process,
    it is typical for the stem to flare, since the transition to the serif is not
    sharp. Pretty much any calligraphy text book will illustrate this.\r\n\r\nNot
    only is this flaring not indicative of expansion, with an expansion tool you typically
    get a much more abrupt transition to the serif, because you are releasing pressure
    at the bottom of the stem. Hence the flat serifs in most Didot and Bodoni revivals.\r\n\r\n<em>I
    have said I like [Peter's] ideas that irregularities that pass in handwriting
    will become problematic in type.</em>\r\n\r\nYes, I like this too, and it makes
    a lot of sense: writing is a more forgiving medium precisely because it is inconsistent
    so 'mistakes' are not repeated every time a letter is made. When you 'write with
    prefabricated letters' to use Noordzij's phrase, you want them to be at their
    best.\r\n\r\nYour point about adjustments in larger sizes of type is well made,
    but I think we find a similar approach to 'optical correction' in larger sizes
    of drawn letters too, e.g. in mediaeval versal letters. Writing is very size specific
    in that most styles are based on a relationship of letter proportion to the size
    of the writing implement. [This is explicit in the teaching of the traditional
    Arabic styles: everything is related to the width of the reed nib.] So we can
    expect that there will be more adjustment of letterforms based on writing styles
    such as the Italian humanist book hand at sizes below and above those normally
    written in that style by the scribe. And I think this is observable: at smaller
    sizes, adjustments are made to improve legibility of text, and at larger sizes
    adjustments are made to improve the balance or beauty of individual letters, such
    as those seen in Garamond's gros canon. The closer you are to the typical size
    of the written style, the less important either kind of adjustment is going to
    be, because the writing was tailored to that size to begin with."

    He notes the difference between the way the humanist script was written and the
    more symmetric serifs of early type. Noordzij refers to Jenson's Roman as having
    the symmetrical serifs, which I think is a mistake--it's Griffo who introduced
    the symmetry. If you want to see a clear digital example of following the broad
    pen way of doing serifs, see Trinite, at TEFF.nl \r\n\r\nGriffo's symmetrical
    serifs in my view are typographic rather than chirographic--following what the
    eye wants, not the convenience of the hand. The tapering that Garamond does is
    also, I would think, not the way the hand would do it with a broad pen, even if
    the letter were stroked this way. His tapers start relatively far up the stem,
    not near the bottom. To my eyes they are carefully designed for even color, and
    for aesthetic reasons. The branch joining the n, h, etc adds weight, and the stems
    are thinner there. The slight additional weight on the lower stem evens out the
    look. \r\n\r\nIf Garamond were already influenced by a more flexible pen, you
    would have an argument for his shapes being influenced by writing. But with the
    broad pen and humanist scripts, I don't think the argument is cogent. \r\n\r\nNoordzij
    notes that symmetrical serifs are not chirographic, and attempts to account for
    this. He says that \"Jenson could have copied this [assymetrical lozenge] shape
    faithfully in his punches, but the extra work would not have paid. ...rectangular
    footings are much more easily cut than lozenges.\" This argument doesn't hold
    water, because in fact Jenson did serifs that more resemble humanist writing,
    and then Griffo moved further away.  \r\n\r\nHe goes on to note other differences
    of type from writing but argues to minimize or dismiss them. John, you, being
    more holy than Pope Gerrit, even deny the differences. But that denial doesn't
    stand up to the reality of the record, I think. The influences were not simply
    the hand, but also the eye and ideals of aesthetics and ease of reading. \r\n\r\nNoordzij
    is keen to controvert \"the time when everybody was eager to hear stories about
    a typography which could be independent of handwriting.\" He is right of course
    about the strong influence of the pen, and his important contributions have established
    that. But to say that other considerations are not key parts of the story is to
    go to the other extreme. That is understandable in a pioneering and corrective
    effort, but also wrong. In my view there is a dialectic between the hand and the
    eye in the development of type, and the eye often leads, and sometimes contradicts
    what the hand would write. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    miniscule hand is different, and that type makers adopted the symetrical serif
    of the roman capitals as their model. Which, as you imply, is significant. But
    my basic point remains: the swelling of the stem in this construction is not indicative
    of an expansion stroke, as you suggested, but is the normal characteristic of
    this kind of serif as produced with a translation tool.\r\n\r\nThe distinction
    between written and 'built-up' letters tends to get blurred in the most formal
    styles of any script. The nature of formal, as distinct from cursive, writing
    involves the pen leaving the paper more often, and sometimes addition of non-fundamental
    strokes to complete a particular shape associated with the style. In some classical
    Arabic styles, for instance, certain shapes are augmented with the corner of the
    pen and then filled; this despite the fact that the overall appearance looks very
    fluid and Arabic writing is frequently referred to as 'cursive' on account of
    its connectivity. Writing is a very varied and complex phenomenon, and it is a

    think Wim Crouwel's new alphabet definitely escapes the chirographic. But that's
    the kind of radical approach necessary to sever the connection.\r\n\r\nI think
    as long as one is considering letter construction at all in terms of strokes,
    then the chirographic isn't far away. And bear in mind what I wrote today in response
    to Bill: our concept of writing shouldn't be limited by experience of Anglo-American
    handwriting, i.e. chirography implies all textual marks directly made with the
    hand and a tool, and that includes styles in which strokes are built up, or outlined
    and filled, as found in various writing traditions around the world.\r\n\r\nIn
    order to get away from chirographic models or influences, you need to come up
    with a different conception of what the glyph is, i.e. something other than a
    collection of strokes. There are designers who have done this. I don't take Crouwel's
    approach very seriously, since the result doesn't actually work for text, but
    the idea of a glyph as a geometrically circumscribed space is, for better or for
    worse, a genuine break with chirography. It is different also from the attempts
    at geometric letter construction as proposed by D\xFCrer, Feliciano et al, because
    they were trying to discover a geometric basis for letters that were already being
    written, while Crouwel was using geometry to discover new letters.\r\n\r\nMore
    interesting, though, is the approach to the glyph as a figure-ground relationship,
    as seen in much of Frutiger's work and in Evert Bloemsma's types."

    shows exactly this phenomenon in the context of Burgundian miniscule, in which
    overalapping strokes are essential creating the letters. Of course this is writing,
    just as it is writing when an Arabic scribe deftly outlines and fills the top
    of the isolated or initial ayn in the context of creating naskh text: that is
    <em>how</em> that script is written. Are you saying that no one, ever in history,
    has 'written' Classical roman capitals because the way to write them involves
    going back over the stem to create the second serif? It seems to me that you have
    a very limited notion of what constitutes writing.\r\n\r\nBelow is Fr Catich's
    illustration of how to write the Trajan letters with a broad brush (sorry it is
    out of focus: it's too late for natural light here and I don't like the flash).
    The same technique is shown in any calligraphy manual treating the writing of
    the Roman capitals with a broad nib. These letters are one way of writing the
    Latin alphabet. The technique they use is non-cursive, i.e. the pen leaves the
    page during the construction of the letters, which is the crucial distinction
    between formal (formata) and cursive (corsiva) styles of writing. Whether the
    pen comes back down and goes over an existing stroke or comes down and makes an
    entirely separate stroke depends on the form of the individual letter and the
    conventions of the individual style.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/catichstrokes_6517.jpg]\r\n\r\n<em>If
    you allow built up shapes as \u2019strokes\u2019, then everything is allowed...</em>\r\n\r\nI
    didn't say I allowed built up shapes as strokes, I allow them as <em>writing.</em>
    I also consider cuneiform text made by pressing a stylus into soft clay writing:
    the direct result of hand and tool, with a distinctive pattern of shapes resulting
    from the movement of the hand and the nature of the tool. There is plenty of writing
    in the world that is not stroke based in its creation. In the case of the Roman
    capitals written with a broad brush or nib, though, we are definitely talking
    about stroke based writing, and the fact that bits of strokes are written on top
    of other strokes doesn't alter the fact, any more than it does for the Burgundian
    miniscule.\r\n\r\nNow, insofar as some methods of writing might be said to contravene
    a stroke method -- the treatment of the top of the ayn in naskh certainly does,
    and the outlined and filled mediaeval versals are a good example of a style that
    many people might have trouble classifying as 'writing' --, exactly the same questions
    may be asked about them as we have been asking about typographic letters, i.e.
    to what degree are they 'paraphrase' of the stroke and to what degree are they
    'escape'. Note: note paraphrase or escape writing, but paraphrase or escape the
    stroke. What this means, of course, is that in this aspect too of text creation
    typography doesn't really introduce anything wholly new under the sun."

    And indeed I referred to it above in answering you. \r\n\r\nBut also I wrote that
    that is <em>not</em> what is going on in the Garamond lower case letters I posted.
    The difference is subtle, but crucial, and indeed illustrates the main point that
    I have been arguing. \r\n\r\nCatich\u2019s illustration shows how to draw capitals
    with an extra stroke for one side of a fairly symmetrical serif. Catich I believe
    says that these were painted with a brush, and I think it is a stretch it to say
    that the style of monumental capitals on the Trajan column and other stone carving
    is a copy of handwriting. But that is not essential to my argument. \r\n\r\nWhat
    is essential is that your illustration shows exactly what I said is the difference
    between Garamond and this way of writing or painting a capital. The Catich illustration
    has a *straight* stem, with an added flair at the bottom.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Garamond
    Gros Canon n_4217.gif] \r\n\r\nThe Garamond letters above do not have straight
    stems. As the attached \u2018n\u2019 from Garamond\u2019s Gros Cannon shows, the
    stems swell gradually beginning just below the join of the branch. This swelling
    is an <em>expansion</em> of the shape as it descends below the join. You could
    get such expansion by deliberate building but you will not get it simply by a
    stroke of the broad pen to add a serif at the bottom of the letter. Just to blend
    the serif into the stroke smoothly you do not need to go that high on the stem,
    and then sharply change the curvature of the stroke as you go down. And as you
    conceded, the humanist script lower case in any case was not written with such
    two stroke serifs at the bottom. \r\n\r\nThe difference between handwriting and
    built up letters is crucial here. I am pointing out that that Garamond is doing
    built-up lettering or, more precisely, sculpted letters--and these consciously
    and systematically depart from the stroke of the pen when writing letters by hand.
    \r\n\r\nJust to be clear about the difference, Noordzij writes very emphatically
    that built-up letter shapes not do not count as handwriting (p. 9 of  <em>The
    Stroke</em>):\r\n\r\n\u201CThe first, initial, fundamental shape is the single
    track of a tool. Only handwriting preserves the characteristics of the single
    stroke. <em>Handwriting</em> is single-stroke writing. <em>Lettering</em> is writing
    with built-up shapes. In lettering the shapes are more patient than in handwriting,
    as they accept retouching strokes that may gradually improve (or impair) the quality
    of the shapes. Lettering is independent of the tool, but this freedom is only
    available at the expense of character: in writing composed of overlapping strokes
    the shapes of single strokes get lost...\u201D\r\n\r\nI have been arguing all
    along that type deliberately and systematically departs from handwriting, even
    though it is strongly influenced by it. It departs to serve both aesthetics and
    readability. And there are traditions in which the departures of earlier type
    designers influence later type designers. \r\n\r\nHere in Garamond\u2019s lower
    case we have one such departure and tradition. I do not see this \u2018waisted\u2019
    stroke in the humanist writing you posted, or other humanist writing. I do see
    it in Garamond, and then in later type designs, such as those of Caslon, two centuries
    later. And that is because there are type traditions, traditions that contradict
    the natural stroke of the pen. Fred Smeijers, author of <em>Counter Punch</em>,
    Smeijers sees punch-cutting as an essential influence on typeface design. And
    not co-incidentally, he uses the punch-cutter\u2019s sculptured stem waist in
    some of his types. \r\n\r\nPunch-cutting is the sculpting of letters, not writing.
    And that difference, as Noordzij notes, gives a freedom that the pen lacks, for
    good or ill. The putting of \u2018waists\u2019 into lower case characters, I believe
    for reasons of even color as well as aesthetics, is one example of how punch-cutters
    took advantage of that freedom to create shapes that contradicted the written
    line of the broad pen of fixed width.  \r\n\r\nPunch-cutting, and not only writing,
    is an important influence on design. Here I think Harry Carter and Fred Smeijers
    have good points to make.  \r\n\r\nNow I recognize that there is some ambiguity
    here. At what point do overlapped strokes, which occur naturally in writing, become
    built-up shapes? I would submit that when you systematically alter a shape that
    was never drawn that way for lower case letters, and differently even what would
    be done for Caps, and in a way not called for by smooth shapes, then you are building
    letters, not writing. It is just Noordzij\u2019s deep analysis of handwriting
    that has helped me to see what is not handwriting, but sculpture. \r\n\r\nType
    wasn\u2019t written, it was punch cut, and that is a key fact that changed type
    design. It didn\u2019t remove the powerful influence of the pen, but it did enable
    other influences to be expressed and other goals to be served, in ways that were
    not only different, but sometimes even contradicted the stroke of the broad pen.

    \r\n\r\nThanks, John. I am not sure how best to characterize the departures of
    type from handwriting. To investigate it properly would involve taking good scans
    of Jenson, Griffo, and Garamond, blowing them up and writing over them with a
    broad pen. That would be very interesting, but not something I'm likely to do
    any time soon.  \r\n\r\n>I\u2019ve always liked the [analysis of letter shapes]
    implicit in Douglas Hofstadter\u2019s response to Donald Knuth\u2019s concept
    of a Metafont (Visible Language, Volume XVI #4 (Autumn 1982). Others might like
    others. ...But in my discussions with Noordzij about Hofstadter\u2019s he seems
    to see it as antithetical to his.\r\n\r\nPeter, I think the failure of Knuth's
    Metafont as a way of creating letters is very interesting and perhaps revealing
    of the differences between handwriting and type. I believe Knuth's ideas appeared
    in print at about the same time as Noordzij's, and have some striking similarities,
    along with differences. Noordzij writes of a moving shape--tip of the pen--and
    its rotation and expansion. Knuth I believe has a single line, and rules of expansion
    of that line. \r\n\r\nCan you briefly summarize Hofstedter's view? Does Noordzij
    object to Knuth, or Hofstedter, or both?\r\n\r\nJohn has, as I remember, explained
    that in developing non-latin fonts he sometimes uses the pen to understand the
    ductus of a non-latin script. But then for creating a font he \"sculpts\" digital
    outlines, like almost everybody else these days. \r\n\r\nThis process of understanding
    the underlying writing, but actually sculpting outlines, I think reflects the
    reality of type--that it is modified handwriting. Both the fact that it has a
    base of handwriting and the modifications are essential. But the much of the work
    of type design is in sculpting the outlines. \r\n\r\nThe fact is that we could
    use digital pens to produce fonts, but in general we don't. And the more pen-influenced
    approach of Metafont resulted in poor-looking fonts, according to Richard Southall
    in his book 'Printers Types in the 20th Century'. \r\n\r\nSo I'm thinking that
    the departures from writing, both for readability and aesthetics, may be a quite
    large percentage of what is involved in type design. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\u201Cthe departures from writing, both for readability and aesthetics\u201D
    [Bill]\r\n\r\nHow can I explain to you why I object to this way of putting things?
    \r\n\r\nWriting is neither unreadable, nor is it ugly. The departures are not
    \u2018for\u2019 readability and aesthetics in the sense that there are or were
    readability and aesthetic problems with writing in its benchmark instantiations
    or as a category, that type as a category tries in a progressively ascending way
    to solve or address. \r\n\r\nThe problems that departures from the specifics of
    specific writing conventions try to solve or address are, as I tried to say, problems
    generated by what happens optical-grammatically when a specific convention of
    writing is paraphrased in sculpted forms on the ends of recangular blocks of metal,
    which force them a certain distance apart and to rigorously conform to a carefully
    structure height / width grid. Paraphrase is what sculpting has to be or do, if
    it is to continue using the communcation convention that was sparked and shaped
    by direct mark-making.\r\n\r\nDepartures from writing are not essential, but feature
    manipulation in the context of paraphrastic stratagies is unavoidable, characteristic
    of type design, and can be productive.\r\n\r\nAbout the Douglas Hofstadter response
    to Donald Knuth and how what Donald Knuth proposed relates to Noordzij I\u2019ll
    transcribe a section from Hofstader\u2019s Abstract, and point you to the Epilogue
    of Noordzij's RIDT paper as a start. The first sentence of Hofstadter's extract
    reads: \u201CIt is argued that readers are likely to carry away from Donald Knuth's
    article \u201CThe concept of a Meta-Font\u201D a falsely optimisitc view of the
    extent to which the design of typefaces and letterforms can be mechanized through
    an approach depending on describing letterforms by specifying the settings of
    a large number of parameters.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn this context Hofstadter outlines
    a way to letterform descritption using \u2018quirk-notes\u2019 to define how in
    a specific font, \u2018roles\u2019 across the alphabet are filled. For example
    the \u2018stem\u2019 role or the \u2018bowl\u2019 role, or the \u2018ascender\u2019
    role, and how the roles relate, that is, the styles of their joining."

  body: ">Writing is neither unreadable, nor is it ugly.\r\n\r\nWriting can be beautiful
    or ugly, just like type. Perhaps I should have said for 'stylistic reasons'. The
    point is that you might want to modify a glyph in a way that is further from writing
    to get the look you want. To take a clear-cut example, the Futura lower case 'a'
    was an attempt to be geometrical and have no trace of the movement of the pen
    in it. \r\n\r\nAs to readability, I accept the old notion that extended text is
    most readable when set in a lower case serifed roman, and every departure from
    that decreases ease of reading, and possibly speed. Certainly I think hand writing
    can be quite readable, but as a rule in extended text it is much less easy to
    read than printing. The formal hands were partly an attempt at regularity that
    helps reading, but I don't think even the best of the formal hands is as easy
    to read as good type, well set. \r\n\r\n>The poor quality of Metafont font\u2019s
    isn\u2019t really that a product of the fact that it was pen-influenced, but that
    a mechanically tractable parametrization of a mechanical pen\u2019s enabled behaviours
    and dimensions can\u2019t respond effectively to the optical-grammatical issues
    adjusting values over those parameters evokes.\r\n\r\nI think you mean \"mathematically\"
    rather than \"mechanically\", as what is involved here are equations, not a physical
    device.\r\n\r\nIn any case the problem is not, I think, finding the mathematics
    to express each desirable modification. It is that you'd have to have modifications
    for each letter of each font, so it is quicker just to design the damn outline.
    \r\n\r\nTo put it another way the modifications are just do specific, and the
    what pleases the eye too complex and unknown as yet to produce a general mathematical
    model what would cover all cases, give a relatively small set of 'quirk-notes',
    as Hofstedter calls them.\r\n\r\nFor example, the stem on the B is often reduced
    by a few units relative to the H, which helps even color, as the bowls of the
    B will otherwise make the stem look a little fat. And so sometimes is the last,
    thick stem of the M reduced. Again, you have some visual crowding with all those
    diagonals in a small space, and lightening the thing helps. Question: What is
    the rule for how much you should reduce the M, given the B? Answer: there isn't
    any rule. For the eye, it will probably depend on the contrast, boldness, serif
    if any, width of the glyph, optical size, etc. etc. \r\n\r\nAnd different people
    will make different decisions. Matthew Carter will make good decisions. Some others
    won't. Carter's font will read well, and look good, and another's might not. Still
    others will make good decisions different from Carter's. Type design, as has been
    often noted by such experienced designers as G. Briem, is a series of thousands
    of decisions--at least one or two for each glyph, in each style, and sometimes
    in each weight.\r\n\r\nNow the thing about those decisions, such as on the stems
    of the B and the M, is that they are <em>type design</em> decisions, not <em>writing</em>
    decisions. They concern details that are at a level of precision that is generally
    not possible in writing, but is possible, and indeed demanded by a professional
    quality text font. \r\n\r\nIt is because I am right now wrestling every day with
    these demands of a quality text font that I am so insistent that very many of
    these decisions are not writing decisions, and that they do make an important
    difference. Perhaps Noordzij was unimpressed by the 'quirk notes' idea for similar
    reasons. They aren't quirks, they are type design.  \r\n\r\nOf course you could
    say with some justice that all type designers are quirky, but that's what it takes

    arose \u2014 or came about \u2014 <em>because of</em> perceived or intrinsic difficulties

    is conditioning, and how much affordance. So that to has to be factored in.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I've tried to say that while the results of genuinely optical-grammatically motivated
    adjustments sometimes have precedants in writing, this isn't ever or always the
    whole story. These optical-grammatically motivated adjustments might in other
    instances reflect other disciplines, like deliberate figure / ground gauging or
    form counterform experimentation as in the cases of Frutiger and Bloemsma's Legato.\r\n\r\nThe
    computer <em>is</em> a mechanical device, but it's parametrization is algorized,
    which is where the math comes in. Parameterized design can't make optical-grammatical
    adjustments, because it can't predict where they might be needed; but these are
    the essence of what it takes to make glyphs \u2018work\u2019 together and well
    in the conditions of use they're destined for. So that's where the blood sweat
    and tears in type will always lie.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, microtypographical adjustments
    are not inconsequential quirks, but if they are functional, deliberate, historical
    and systematic, they can be described in \u2018quirk-notes\u2019 because they
    are particulare to the individual glyph-set or style."

    to illustrate your statements I find it hard to be sure what you mean. \r\n\r\nI
    take it by 'consolidation and extension of affordances' you mean that the type
    becomes more readable. I don't think this is a by-product or \"gift\" of the sense
    that type designers have of something being 'not right' and feeling a need to
    adjust proportions of a glyph or weights of parts to make it 'work', as John put
    it. \r\n\r\nMy feeling is that a big part of the sense of something not being
    right relates to good rhythm and even color in the type. These are the <em>same
    thing</em> as what promotes readability, and indeed makes good text types more
    readable than handwriting. So a large part of 'working' and 'being right' is readability--not
    a different variable of which has the consequence of helping readability. \r\n\r\nSo
    if you mean by 'epiphenomenon' a by-product, then I don't agree. But if you mean
    that the sense of rightness includes good color and rhythm, which are part of
    readability, then I agree.\r\n\r\n>[Changes came about] because of perceived or

    that type designers were dissatisfied with the way writing looked. As I said above,
    I liked your analysis that the regularity of type gave rise to a new standard.
    Variations that would have been submerged in the general variability of handwriting
    became obtrusive because of repetition of the same characters over and over again
    in type. But the net effect of being hit with what looks 'wrong' and the new ability
    in punch cutting to control outlines to a finer degree of tolerance had the result--through
    the eyes and hands and imagination of great designers--of type that surpassed
    the readability of handwriting. "

    partially isolatible, but interrelated factors, which we might make ourselves
    aware of. Some have to do with realities of structuration on the object side,
    and some have to do with realities of conditioning and bias on the subject side.
    I\u2019d love if you could affirm this, but than I\u2019d want to ask why you
    won\u2019t let this temper your broad generalizations in ways that I and maybe
    others might find them easier to embrace.\r\n\r\nIn my book rhythm and even colour,
    as well as form / counterform logic and figure / ground control are optical-grammatical
    issues that have a lot to do with structuration on the object side. And the affordances
    that I am interested in are perceptual discrimination offordances and visual wordform
    resolutional affordances. Solving optical grammatical issues in one way might
    be productive or counterproductive when it comes to consolidating affordances.
    A type might become too regular. But these things aren't so easily decidable just
    by direct optical-grammatical gauging. I think all type-involved people should
    push beyond simple, conditioned statements to that level of awareness.  \r\n\r\nPerceptual
    discrimination has to do with how well the eye can make out the criterial parts
    of letters in the context of the word, sentence and text-block wholes these parts
    are part of; wordform resolution has to do with how easily and resiliently these
    parts in their relation form letters that gel well into stable, unitary, robust
    word-objects, because of the way they are open to and relate to other letters.\r\n\r\nI
    mean by consolidation and extension of affordances, that the types became more
    resistant to visual wordform resolutional collapse in tougher and a wider range
    of contexts of use. This comes out as readable in smaller sizes, or readable under
    greater print degredation. But I don't want to draw from these specifics that
    type is intrinsically more readable than writing, or one type than the other,
    on some absolute readability measure. All I think it is warranted to say is that
    affordance structures differ from type to type: some are deep and broad, others
    are pointed, rich but narrow. I would be happier to talk about readability or
    affordance profiles, using my kind of distinctions, than I am about readability
    as such in a kind of winner take all scheme.\r\n\r\nGiven that the experience
    of comfort in reading is distinctly and complexly multifactorial in the ways I
    try to describe, to make broad \u2018ranking\u2019 statements using \u2018readability\u2019
    as a measure is a strategy whose productive, pedagogic, and \u2018fairness\u2019

    What I am saying is that some of them have been, and those concerning even color
    and good rhythm resulted in type being more readable than handwriting.\r\n\r\nAnd
    that is not because type creators they were any better workmen or artists than
    the scribes. It is because the medium offered greater control over outlines, and
    in a more limited way, spacing. And some superb type creators, such as Garamond,
    were able to take advantage of this greater control. \r\n\r\nReadability, or ease

    my impression of greater readability is not simply due to habituation and familiarity,

    it another go.\r\n\r\nAfter some more reflection, here is what I see now through
    my \u2018perceptual processing in reading\u2019 lens. (It probably brings me closer
    to what you, Bill, feel to be the case, but this way of framing it eases my reluctance.)\r\n\r\nI'll
    start with this: Gerrit Noordzij sees the middle ages as the period of the consolidation
    of the word.\r\n\r\nIn writing with the broad-nibbed pen the consolidation of
    affordances approached a kind of stall-point or highpoint or limit around the
    time type made its entrance. In type the consolidation dynamic could continue
    apace concurrently or be productively resumed because of the less constrained
    feature manipulation it allowed. Feature manipulation overtly addresses optical-grammatical
    (\u2018look\u2019) issues (like regularity, or evenness of colour) and gestural-atmospheric
    (\u2018feel\u2019) wants (like, greater angularity or cursivity or varied stress),
    all the while \u2014 just under the surface of conscious awareness \u2014 re-mapping
    visual-wordform resolutional affordances, quietly adjusting its thresholds and
    ranges, and basis.\r\n\r\nBecause it re-tunes the basis, it requires a small-incremental
    reconditioning of it\u2019s victims (a pick-up phrase originating in some other
    context from some of my conversations with Noordzij). But the re-tuning of the
    thresholds and ranges are real readability gains. \r\n\r\nSo to me this says the
    greater feature-manipulational flexibility in punchcutting, could initiate a consolidation
    of the readability affordances of writing beyond writing, though not without a
    cost. The cost is growing distance from the readability and character of first-rate
    scribal writing, especially when you factor in the unfamiliarity of the foreign
    or earlier mother tongue.\r\n"

    historical creators of type made were based on readability. What I am saying is
    that some of them have been, and those concerning even color and good rhythm resulted
    in type being more readable than handwriting.\r\n\r\nAnd that is not because type
    creators they were any better workmen or artists than the scribes. It is because
    the medium offered greater control over outlines, and in a more limited way, spacing.
    And some superb type creators, such as Garamond, were able to take advantage of
    this greater control.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we all know, control over outlines does
    not always result in superior outlines. Look at the state of type design today.\r\n\r\nMany
    think that type well set is of minor importance compared to type design in the
    determination of readability. I care to differ. I could take Garamond and make
    it very difficult to read even at 12 point printed crisply. No, I do not mean
    by removing anyone's reading glasses.\r\n\r\nAlso, some pain from \"unreadable
    type faces\", such as Bodoni, can be eased by careful setting.\r\n\r\nQuickly
    handwriting became more of a \"hangover and not so much a model for type design\".\r\n\r\nTools
    do affect outlines, not to mention right handed people have dominated left handed.
    Counter punches compared to gravures, the two schools of thought? Now the cold
    mechanical feeling of digital type. This could be a lengthy discussion but I am
    going to spare us all.\r\n\r\nThe church found Gutenberg's Bible of minor importance
    compared to the lavish financial profits from the indulgences he printed. The
    business of printing dictated many different objectives. As I mentioned much earlier,
    Aldus Manutius invented the pocket book. There was great interest in making types
    readable in smaller sizes. This saved not only paper but allowed for more pages
    in the chase thus reducing press time.\r\n\r\nIs handwriting more readable/legible,
    or even possible at six point than type? I think not! I predict, if it is possible
    to handwrite that small, (avoiding an embarrassing surprise) it must be hard to
    read at all. Besides I don't think they made a goose feather small enough. For
    the record, I believe the smallest hand set type ever made was 2 1/2 point, probably
    commissioned by an unscrupulous lawyer.\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed in an eye
    examination letters are used. Well, they aren't in Finland. Still, keep in mind
    the conspiracy between French eye glass manufactures and printers. They both had
    much to gain by smaller type sizes. Not to mention, the consumer was advantaged
    financially. Well, they all were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    accurate than my attempt to get at this idea by looking at feature manipulation
    as an extension of the stroke logic inherited from writing. I like this idea of
    consolidation of a process that is already taking place in writing. It fits well
    with examples from a number of different scripts, in which one sees formal styles
    of writing develop that begin, sometimes in individual features or letters, to
    break with 'the single track of a tool'. [It is because of such instances that

    The cost is growing distance from the readability and character of first-rate
    scribal writing, especially when you factor in the unfamiliarity of the foreign

    has parallels within typography as in e.g. the loss of ability of many people
    to read fraktur with any ease or comfort. I wrote earlier in this discussion that
    we could not say whether e.g. Griffo's types were significantly more readable
    than the scribal book hand <em>for people who were used to reading that hand,</em>
    i.e. the contemporary audience for both kinds of books. Type could make consistently
    readable text at smaller sizes, and hence had an economical advantage, but at
    equivalent sizes I'm not convinced that there was any significant gain in readability.
    The 'consolidation of the readability affordances' were expressed in a reduction
    in the size of text. I wonder if any records survive indicating a rise in the

  body: "First of all, just to be clear, I am not disparaging the accomplishments
    of scribes. There were over 3000 years of scribes writing alphabetic scripts and
    now something over 500 years of type. The scribes already did a great deal to
    make writing readable, including not only letter proportions, but also key matters
    of layout, such as amount of letter and word spacing, line measure, space between
    lines, and margins. And these, as Giampa points out, are also keys to readability.
    The scribes had already worked out much of the rules of readable text that we
    still follow.  \r\n\r\nHowever, there is a remaining area of difference of opinion
    I have with John and Peter, unless I have won Peter over in a discussion off-line.
    I think that evenness of spacing and color provides a relatively neutral framework
    or grid, within which the differences between letters are easily detected by the
    eye. When color or spacing is uneven, or there are other extraneous variations,
    this constitutes 'noise' that interferes with the detection of the 'signal' of
    letter differences. \r\n\r\nThat is why I still think that good type, well set,
    is more readable than good writing. Good writing still has more inherent 'noise'
    in it than good type, because of greater variability. The dimension of readability
    I have in mind here is how cognitively taxing it is to read text. This aspect
    of readability has not yet been tested, to my knowledge, but I have several times
    advocated such testing here on Typophile. I think that when good writing in familiar
    styles easily decoded by us--eg not Fraktur for most of us--is read it will prove
    more taxing than good printed text. And the more florid writing, with extraneous
    swashes etc, the more taxing it will be. \r\n\r\nIf this is a general psychological
    principle, we can reasonable apply it to readers in the 16th century, who didn't
    have greatly different DNA than we do. \r\n\r\nThis is also not to say that writing
    is less beautiful. In the hands of a superb calligrapher, it can be more beautiful--though
    less serviceable for long passages of text. "

    I think we have to take text size into account here. Where type has the most obvious
    edge over handwriting is in being able to produce smaller text with the same regularity
    and evenness of colour and spacing as a good scribe could produce at typically
    larger sizes.* This is a much more obvious advantage of type than the notion of
    type getting rid of noise, which I find very problematic, especially if we're
    comparing the textual culture of the first 100 years of printing from moveable
    metal type in Europe. The fact is that the vast majority of early printing was
    not very good: a lot of type was either over-inked or under-inked, the impressions
    were uneven (even on the same page), the metal alloys were not well developed
    and the type wore quickly, there is often a lot of extra-textual noise from ink
    spots. Even some of the most well-respected names in typographic history produced
    a lot of poorly printed books -- I know, I own some of them --, not just the justly
    admired masterpieces that get reproduced in books on type history. By comparison,
    the scribes -- seeking to compete in quality where they could not compete in quantity
    or economy -- were doing their best work during the same period, using highly
    prepared parchments and papers, well-maintained reeds and quills, carefully prepared
    inks. And if by 'noise' we include not only variation in letterforms or spacing
    but all those other factors that diminished the quality of so much printing then
    the manuscripts are by far the cleaner product.\r\n\r\n[The preparation of the
    writing surface in the Islamic scribal tradition is particularly important, because
    the reed pen is pushed so often when writing Arabic, and the sized papers they
    use are generally smoother than anything produced for either manuscript or print
    in Europe. The cleanest, sharpest letters I have ever seen were handwritten Arabic
    script.]\r\n\r\n\r\n* There are traditions of very small writing -- micrography
    -- in some scripts, notably Arabic and Hebrew. These are most often employed in
    decorative ways: you see a picture or a pattern, look at it more closely and you
    see that it contains a text in tiny letters. The Arabic term for such writing
    is <em>ghubar</em> -- literally 'dust' --, and a special style of writing was
    developed for it. The typical alif height of ghubar is less than 2mm; sometimes
    as small as 1.3mm. Because ghubar was sometimes used to write Qur'anic passages,
    legibility was, of course, extremely important."

    I don't think even spacing and color forces a designer to iron out variation in
    shapes. Indeed variation in shape is often needed to achieve even color, because
    of the very different shapes of different letters. For example, the tapering of
    diagonals prevents clotted joins, contributing to even color, but it also creates
    more lively, varied shapes in the alphabet. Accomplishing both liveliness and

    good question. On the one hand, one can guess that a major change in script style
    might not have occured until it did in fact occur with the influence of a new
    writing tool, but prior to the invention of type the scripts of Europe were constantly
    evolving and subject to alterations in compression, proportion, etc., and of course
    there were important regional scripts that gradually disappeared with the standardisation
    of roman types. Noordzij turns Bill's question on its head, wondering what might
    have happened if type had not frozen formal writing into those particular forms:
    \"A stop of 500 years in the development of text scripts is long enough to make
    one look upon formal writing as static. Against a continuous tradition of 5000
    years, however, the interruption has been merely incidental.'\r\n\r\n<em>And my
    impression is that even in formal documents, such as contracts, writing quickly
    became more cursive after the introduction of printing. Is this right?</em>\r\n\r\nIn
    Italy, chancery writing tended to be cursive anyway, but also highly elaborated
    with swashes and ornamental devices: so cursive in form, but without the characteristic
    speed of writing we associate with that term. The humanist roman was specifically
    a book hand, intended for literary, theological and scientific texts. The quickly
    written cursive, without elaboration, which is the mother of italic type, was
    a kind of note hand, often found in manuscripts copied for their content by individual
    scholars rather than by professional scribes (such manuscripts seem to me the
    very model for Aldus' small format books in italic type).\r\n\r\nIn England and
    some other parts of northern Europe, blackletter remained the norm for chancery
    documents for a long period, only to be replaced by the split nib scripts."

    and the proportionality between linespacing and the x-height of the typeface is
    reasonable and not excessive.\r\n\r\nThe first edition was done in a typeface
    that resembled Jenson's, perhaps Cloister Lightface. In both, the spacing between
    x-heights is roughly one x-height. The choice of typeface, the absence of leading,
    the short width of the lines, the large point size... oh, yes, \"pointed anachronism\"
    a la William Morris is certainly not entirely absent.\r\n\r\nIt's there to such
    a limited and tasteful degree, though, that my initial response is that the first
    edition is simply \"fancy\" typography, entirely appropriate to the printing of
    a short work with typography as its subject... and the second edition reflects
    a wholly pedestrian setting of body copy, equally well suited to a book of instruction
    on the use of a log-log slide rule or the maintenance of a furnace.\r\n\r\nBaskerville
    is still a beautiful typeface, and, indeed, still a bit too old-fashioned for
    many uses, but I do find fault with any typographical aesthetic that does not
    leave room for printing to adopt \"fancy dress\" or \"formal wear\" at times.
    Pedestrian typography, in contexts where conscious attention to beauty is normally
    expected, is itself jarring to the reader; while I basically agree with the \"crystal
    goblet\" viewpoint, this seems to be an example of taking it too far."

  body: ">Hey Bill, if you are going to reference the Clearview stuff, at least get
    it right.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote (four years ago), I was operating from memory, and
    unfortunately mixed up some features of the story. Thanks for the partial correction.
    However, your account above also does not get the story quite right, at least
    according to [[http://clearviewhwy.com/ResearchAndDesign/legibilityStudies.php|this
    page on the Clearview Highway web site.]]\r\n\r\nAccording to the story on the
    web site, in the original tests that validated the superiority of Clearview Highway,
    the stroke width/height ratio for Clearview Highway was, as you say, 1:5.5, a
    lighter weight than the original Highway Gothic, as shown in this graphic:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClearviewHighwayOrig_3771.png]
    \r\n\r\nHowever, it says your final width/height ratio was 1:5.1 (not \"a true
    1:5,\" as you write above), slightly less bold than 1:5 of Highway Gothic. Further,
    that ratio it seems is the ratio of stroke width to cap height, not to x-height.
    That is important, because the essay explains that in the final version you also
    increased the x-height as well as increasing boldness from your original 1:5.5
    ratio. Thus in the x-height region, which is critical as you use lower case, the
    ratio of stroke width to x-height is still quite noticeably less bold than Highway
    Gothic. At least this is what I conclude from the comparative graphic including
    the final version (compare top and bottom signs):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Clearview_comparisons_5957.png]\r\n\r\nA
    final complication is that, at least as of the date of that on-line essay, the
    tests that showed the superiority of Clearview were only done on the original,
    lighter version. So we don't know how the original lighter version compares to
    the final Clearview, with somewhat heavier strokes and greater x-height. Was this
    final version ever tested against the earlier, lighter version?   \r\n\r\nSo the
    general point that Clearview Highway is less bold and more readable at a distance
    than Highway Gothic seems valid."
