  I began to wonder... <BR> <BR>What does &#42;your&#42; card look  like? Post it

    er, I mean share. <BR> <BR>Here is the Speak Up card. Letterpressed on 130 lb
    French Paper with two PMS colors. It was ganged on a client project, luckily their
    logo colors matched Speak Up&#39;s. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/18295.jpg"

  body: Here&#39;s mine.  The logo is by Paul Rand, revised a few years ago by Michael
    Beirut I think &#40;it was before I started&#41;. I think the card design is by
    Pentagram too. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/18395.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>Each studio has a it&#39;s own color, and each person gets to
    choose one of about 36 variations of the logo, which makes each card kind of unique.
    The type is Interstate and Bembo.

    it only took me ten years to design my own logo.  When speaking at a conference
    this summer I figured I probably should have a card to pass around.  Haven&#39;t
    even had time to have it photographed yet.  It&#39;s letterpress in black on an
    off-white handmade paper. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/18593.jpg"

  body: I&#39;m just beginning the process of designing my very own card. Coming from
    the UI design, I know little about the technical/logistical side of print. I wondered
    if we could expand this thread to discuss terminology, papers/stock, recommended
    printers, and costs as specifically related to business cards. <BR>Maybe we could
    build a definition list explaining some of the terms, i.e., &#34;one over one&#34;,
    spot varnish&#34; etc.? I&#39;d also be interested in people&#39;s recommendations
    for printers and what price range one can expect for some of the snazzier options.
    <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR> -tim <BR> <BR>ps - please post more of your beautiful
    business cards!

    what do you know, it does! Off the top of my head, there&#39;s one called &#34;Print
    Production for Graphic Designers&#34; that I think gets updated every few years
    or so. I&#39;m sure there are many more. <BR> <BR>If you find a good print rep,
    they&#39;ll be happy to spend some time with you going over the basics -- paper
    types, ink options, finishing techniques, etc. Most good printers are more than
    willing to educate their customers.
