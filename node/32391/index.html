<p><a href="http://www.linotype.com/183977/agilita-family.html">Agilita</a> is a OpenType humanist sans serif, both adaptable and lively. In smaller point sizes, the hairline weight of Agilita is so fragile, it pulsates with the possibility of disappearing and reappearing. The larger the point size of the hairline, however, the more it wants to take charge, its delicacy lifting off the page and grabbing the eye. In heavier weights, Agilita displays an amicable human robustness and warmth. This unique range of appearances from quivering playfulness to classic solidity gives Agilita an independence ideal for highly versatile design applications.</p>
<p>Agilita is created by [[Juergen Weltin|Jürgen Weltin]], who has already shown a talent for embracing diversity and adaptability in his designs. He received accolades for the clean, yet eye-catching strokes of his typeface <a href="http://www.typematters.de/TM_Yellow.html">Yellow</a>, designed for the British Telecommunications directory, and has successfully merged the practical and whimsical side of lettering in such typefaces as <a href="http://www.typematters.de/TM_Finnegan.html">Finnegan</a> and <a href="http://www.typematters.de/TM_Balega.html">Balega</a>.</p>
<p>First sketches for Agilita were drafted early in 2000. Jürgen Weltin made a point of designing clear descenders and ascenders to outline classic letter proportions for a
more definite word shape. The fine, distinct emphasis on the horizontals helps convey a functional yet dynamic humanism. OpenType features include old style figures and a unique @ sign all which go beyond the line and extend the playful movements of this limber typeface - no matter what the size or weight. All in all, the wide-range font family has 32 type styles and consists of ten weights from hairline to bold, plus six additional condensed styles.</p>
<p>Of the ten Agilita weights, the lighter ones are certainly the most exhilarating. Hairline, Ultra Thin, Thin, and Extra Light - these four weights emphasize the power of
Agilita&rsquo;s almost buoyant appearance. Printed in large sizes, these weights command the eye with their agility and expressive human characteristics. The Hairline and Ultra Thin styles have been especially designed for display use or for oversize texts in large-scale signage.</p>
<p>The flexibility and mobility of Agilita means it is also ideal for small detailed layouts or a wide range of other graphic design applications. For example, two sets of arrows are available in all weights for use in orientation systems and complex design or editorial projects, e.g. the special arrows and signs can also be used in dictionaries to add clarity to detailed entries. Designers will also find the corresponding condensed weights especially suitable for narrow columns and tables where horizontal space is scarce. In addition, tabular figures in light, regular, medium and bold share identical widths and are compatible with their italic counterparts, so no last minute line shifting or adjustments is required.</p>
