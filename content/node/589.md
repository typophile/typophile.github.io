  body: huh? haha! Sorry, Hrant, I read that remark as a joke. In which case if you
    aren&#39;t joking I guess it makes sense. I need to bone up on my &#34;typographic&#34;
    vocabulary.

  body: I don&#39;t think Hrant is joking. Although mirroring a character may be applied
    to most vertical-stressed typefaces &#40;Bodoni or Univers, for example&#41; without
    major harms. But imagine what happens if you flip Garamond&#39;s &#34;3&#34;...
    <BR> <BR>&#34;Not professional&#34;? It depends on the typeface you will flip,
    and of course, the way you do the whole thing. Getting a proper flipped-3 &#34;E&#34;
    and doing a bad layout/logo won&#39;t be much &#34;professional&#34; IMHO. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>After inverting the 3 you could then modify it &#40;Or, make your own
    from scratch&#41; so that it fit in more harmoniously with the rest of the letters
    used.

    capital &#34;Y,&#34; and the rounded capital &#34;E,&#34; yielding an informal
