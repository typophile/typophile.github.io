body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Blackletter]] : Deutsche Schrift</strong>\r\n\r\nProbably
  the largest family of [[Blackletter]] types ever cast, the Deutsche Schrift was
  the first of [[Rudolf Koch]]'s designs for the [[Klingspor]] foundry. More weights
  would be added by Koch, the [[Klingspor]]s, and by [[D. Stempel AG]] until the second
  World War.\r\n\r\nFamily members include:\r\nDeutsche Schrift (1908)?\r\nDeutsche
  Schr\xE4gschrift\r\n\r\nDeutsche Anzeigenschrift (Anzeigenschrift means Headline
  Face)\r\n- breiter Schnitt (extended)\r\n- schmaler Schnitt (condensed)\r\n- schmaler,
  halbfetter Schnitt (condensed, semi bold) this was the default design\r\n- enger
  Schnitt (ultra condensed)\r\n\r\nDeutsche Zierschrift (a outlined and engraved version)\r\n\r\nDeutsche
  Werkschrift (Werkschrift means Bookface)\r\n- mager (regular)\r\n- halbfett (semi
  bold)\r\n\r\nKoch wasn't very much in love with this typeface, but due to its great
  commercial success [[D. Stempel AG]] and [[Klingspor]] forced extensions to the
  family. (1910 to at least 1921; some of the Anzeigenschriften were cut during the
  1930s).\r\n\r\n[[Maximillian]] is a similar design to the Deutsche Schrift. Presumably,
  Koch have better feelings about [[Maximillian]]\u2026\r\n"
