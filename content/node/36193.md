  wants to use this font (Chervonek BT) and I have to make everything around it. He
  wants a type only solution with maybe some lines.\r\n\r\nIf anyone as any suggestions

  body: "I prefer the first group, too, because the horizontal line joined with the
    \"p\" resembles a tire mark -- as if the word \"Short Stop\" has been moving on
    high speed and just come to a stop with squeaking tires.\r\n\r\nOn the negative
    side, \"FOOD MART\" is in disharmony with \"Short Stop\", because the two fonts
    are too similar to each other. There is a typography principle saying, \"don't
    put similar typefaces together -- use either the same one or distinctly different
    ones.\" In this case, the letters of \"FOOD MART\" appear too wide and too thin
    -- because they are, in comparison to the letters of the dominant \"Short Stop\".
    My recommendation: Try change the font of \"FOOD MART\" to the same as \"Short
    Stop\", and if \"FOOD MART\" as a whole come out too narrow, try increase its
    letter spacing."

  body: "I have tweeked the logo. I changed the food marts to not be italicized, which
    may be different enough from the display type. I feel like I have to use a sans
    serif, but the display font doesn't work well at a small size as \"food marts\".
    \r\n\r\nThe customer wants all letters to be lower case so I have made that change.\r\n\r\nI
    really like this shape for the logo. It is more unique (although there are similar
    shapes used for other logos) than the other shapes such as the oval, square.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SHORTSTOP8_5974.jpg]"

  body: I prefer the bottom of the last two posted. I think the line which only goes
    to the p is too gimicky and will be difficult to tie in elsewhere when used in
    different ways. I really liked the surf shop version that had the shape warped
    a bit. But I wonder if you can have any shape at all as you said you need a type
    only solution?

    the stroke. Oh, and the weight of the new typeface below seems too thin. The previous
    weight stands better with that of short stop.

  body: "Shadow on top of the line looks *way* better to me. Otherwise it'd be very
    wired, as the descender of the \"p\" would appear shortened.\r\n\r\nThe new typeface
    for \"FOOD MART\" looks great, and I agree that the letter spacing needs to be
    reduced as a result (as in #2 from your latest batch).\r\n\r\nThe lines at the
    sides of \"short stop\" aren't much of a improvement to the logo, but they don't
    hurt either. If you do want to include them, I'd definitely go with #2 from your
    latest batch, and I'd further decreased the thickness of the lines -- to equal
    that of the base line (separating \"short stop\" from \"FOOD MART\"). I'd even
    consider giving them shadows, too, for consistency with \"short stop\"."
