  I'm wondering if anyone has some information about this lovely typeface and its
  author. I can't find much on the Internet, I guess van den Velde is Jan van den
  Velde (1568--1623), calligrapher and author of \"Spieghel der Schrijfkonste\", but
  that's about everything. This little scan has been very influental in the drawing
  of my [[http://typophile.com/node/56025|first oldstyle-experiment]], so I've become
  very curious about this wonderfully idiosyncratic type. "

  body: "This type is by Jacobus van de Velde, not Jan. Sorry, I should have been
    more specific in the original post. Harry Carter notes that \u2018Jacobus van
    de Velde\u2019 is recorded as a bookseller in Amsterdam at the time of his marriage
    in 1682 and of his death in 1709\u2019. An undated type specimen bearing his name
    in the Ensched\xE9 collection is thought to have been produced around 1699.\r\n\r\nHere's
    what the Ensched\xE9/Carter <em>Typefoundries in the Netherlands</em> (the source
    of this image, fig.110 p.140) has to say about the provenance of this type:\r\n\r\n\u2018The
    matrices owned by Alberts & Uytwerf also passed eventually to the Brothers Ploos
    van Amstel. Among the types we acquired from them we still have one of the types
    offered for sale by Van de Velde. It is our <em>English-bodied Roman No.28</em>.
    In our collection there is also one of the types shown in the earliest specimen
    of Alberts & Uytwerf, the [<em>Large</em>] <em>Two-line Small Pica Roman No.29</em>...\u2019\r\n\r\nThis
    No.29 is very similar in style to the van de Velde roman.\r\n\r\nThe image above
    is from an Ensched\xE9 re-setting of the No.28 type as it appeared in van de Velde's
    original specimen. There are other specimens of the type in the Ensched\xE9/Carter
    book, alongside No.29, but as reported in the other thread, this is a difficult
    book to scan or photograph on account of its size."

    I know what to look for. I thought the type looked a little too revolutionary
    for late 16th century. Now I know why. \r\n\r\nI wonder what a display cut of
    this typeface would look like, with all the quirkiness amplified. That compressed,
    almost skeletal s, the proud r, the slightly oblique a with its massive tail,
    that curious c and the decelerating e, the ethereally beautiful t ... "

  body: Yes, the c does look busted. It's a sad fact that we just cannot do something
    like this with digital type, it'd look retarded rather than strangely intriguing,
    as I think this does. But I think the s is even weirder, it looks as if it's from
    another typeface, its weight, width and angle is all wrong. The g also look weird
    in similar ways, from what we can see of it. It might be slightly corrupted by
    some lens distortion, though. And what was old Jacobus thinking when he cut that
    d? Another highly interesting thing is the differing obliqueness of several characters.
    And look at that enormous overshoot on the o and e, and that r stretching its
    nose toward the heavens. This typeface is even weirder than Fleischmann's weird
    stuff, in a more random way. Gee, I dig Baroque weirdness!

  body: "The late afternoon light was nice, so I got out my camera and managed to
    get a reasonably good photograph of the full Ensched\xE9 resetting of the van
    de Velde roman specimen, which shows complete alphabets for uppercase, lowercase
    and smallcaps, as well as numerals and some punctuation. Sorry the photograph
    isn't as sharp as the one above.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JvdVfull_6021.JPG]\r\n\r\nNote
    that we don't know who cut this face. Van de Velde advertised the types for sale,
    but he is identified in records as a bookseller, not a type founder, so it is
    entirely likely that he was only the distributor, not the maker, of the type."

    over the bottom that much, but it could hang out a little.'

    an impression of, those capitals and small capitals are really something. And
    the numerals, oh boy! I'm going to drool over this specimen for quite some time.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a strange coincidence that the figures I've made for the typeface I'm working
    on, slightly inspired by the first specimen, are rather similar to these. And
    I thought my numerals were highly unhistoric ... I've only recently taken a serious
    interest in typography, so I really don't know much type history yet. Seems like
    I'm a Baroque fan, though. \r\n\r\nCould you recommend a good book on early type
    history?\r\n\r\n    "

  body: "It certainly wouldn't have been common, but I believe that vertical kerns
    (overhangs) were done on rare occasion. Obviously an oversized cast on a small
    body would require very careful composition to avoid colliding extenders (and
    careful handling so as not to knock those kerns off).\r\n\r\nNot sure why that
    approach would have been taken with this particular face."

  body: "<em>How is it that the ascenders and descenders overlap (see 3rd and 4th

    is a feature of the type, but of this specific setting. On the same page in the
    Ensched\xE9/Carter book, there is another showing of this type, a poem with much
    more generous linespacing (and featuring a long-s_t ligature that doesn't appear
    in the specimen setting).\r\n\r\nThe images above are from a painstaking re-setting
    of the type as it was shown in the original JvdV specimen, and my guess is that
    in order to fit as much type as possible onto the specimen this type was shown
    with negative leading. Since this was a one-off showing, my guess is that the
    blank tops of the sorts in the lower line were ground down to make room for the
    descenders. That would be easier than casting large on the body and vertically
    kerning descenders onto the face of the type below."

  body: "If it's a one-off situation, then yes, some combination of grinding and a
    kerning saw was probably used.\r\n\r\nBut we should realize that they would have
    been used more broadly than just fitting a few extenders. It looks to me like
    pretty much every line is affected and would require some careful fitting together,
    whether the extenders are in proximity or not.\r\n\r\nLooks like it would have
    been quite a little puzzle to fit together.\r\n\r\n"

    and consistently.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the verticals is a little different, the
    arch differs, the \"feet\" serifs on the 'n' look wider...\r\n\r\nI'm partial
    to that 'n' (actually, I really, really like it) but it's very interesting that
