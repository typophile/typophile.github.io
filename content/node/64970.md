body: "Hi there, hopefully I can explain this!  I'm looking for a simply shaped sans-serif
  font whose letters are made up of a number of parallel lines (sort of like interior
  outlines..) but without caps on the ends of letters, so the capital I is just a
  line of several perfectly vertical lines\r\n\r\nsomething similar will work as well
  since i'm planning on modifying the letters in Illustrator anyway.\r\n\r\nthanks
  a lot!"

  body: thanks for those keywords.. definitely a help! Pump is definitely along the
    right line... though I'm looking for something non-rounded (especially noticeable
    on those captical Ms and Ns..)  ideally it'd be 2 lines in the centre (quadriline?),
    too.. but I know one can't have everything. a font called Cressida is quite close,
    but unfortunately without pointed upper vertices.
