    the customer who assembles it, even if all they do is throw it on.

  body: "Type design is a kind of making or factura. Originally done by hand (manu-facture),
    it is now computer-assisted manufacture. In this sense it is an art requiring
    aptitude and skill in the sense of a techn\xE9.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s principle end
    or telos is to produce objects-of-use for the manufacture of other objects-of-use,
    i.e., books and other species of text, whose principle ends are reading. Because
    the objects of use in this equation are letters and texts and the end is reading,
    readability and legibility are primary considerations.\r\n\r\nIn so far as aesthetic
    considerations and considerations of gestural force or expressivity come into
    play type design approaches, in it\u2019s best practitioners, the conditions of
    the societal institution we call art. \r\n\r\nIn so far as knowledge and the exploration
    of how forms behave in optical-grammatical terms and in so far as the knowledge
    of the limits of affordance in the perceptual-processing terms comes into play,
    type design approaches, in it\u2019s best practitioners, the conditions of an
    exact or applied science.\r\n\r\nIn so far as it is a response to already extant
    type designs and externally or internally constructed briefs type design is a
    social act, and issues of responsiveness, societal enrichment and fashions come
    into play.\r\n\r\nType design is not one or another of these things by itself,
    but all of them together.\r\n\r\n"

  body: If you really need a pigeon hole, how about Information design?  Actually,
    the word design brings in all the stuff about logical pursuit of a solution to
    a problem that involves one part science, one part, perseverance, and one part
    intuition. Given that the typeface is typically a tool used to communicate written
    information, pick one of those two.

    fascinating, I think, is that it has so many different aspects. It doesn't fit

  body: Personally, Bill, I don't see I need to further categorize type design at
    all. Unless all you are looking for is one of those discussions which end up just
    being for the fun of an academic exercise.  I don't see what purpose it serves,
    particularly in this day of intelligent search engines. You don't even need to
    know the hierarchy of system categories to find information as Darwin did years
    ago. You just type "Typeface Design" in to a search box and you get the whole
    enchilada. If you don't know what either a typeface or design is, you are in bigger
    trouble than I can help you with.  The design profession as pertains to any of
    the graphic areas has gone through a long litany of nomenclature changes just
    in my lifetime. People have argued hours over differences between Visual Arts,
    Graphic Arts, Graphic Design, Visual Communication Design and now its many new
    subcategories such as information design, human interface design, web design,
    branding, corporate identity, media design. Unless you are writing an old fashioned
    encyclopedia without an index, where you need to pin a label and sub label on
    everything just to find it in the book it is a futile effort.  I think it is far
    better to spend your time writing an absolute fool-proof set of rules for spelling
    in the English language.  When you finish that, if I am still alive, look me up.  By
    then, all the names will have changed and we will be known as glyphologists or
    bezier wranglers :-)

  body: Neither. I'm not a type designer, but I believe it would fall closest under
    the umbrella of craft. However, it depends on how we define graphic and design
    industrial design.

    don't like Wikipedia's definition of information design because it includes this
    sentence: \"... the term has come to be used specifically for graphic design for
    displaying information effectively, ***rather than just attractively or for artistic
    expression***.\"  (emphasis added by me)\r\n\r\nIn my opinion that sentence misrepresents
    graphic design. While there is some overlap between the fields of art and design,
    the primary difference is that the main goal of a graphic designer is effective
    communication, not making something look pretty or being a vehicle for artistic
    expression."

    fashion...information theory, geometry  with elements of the psychology of perception,
    private, corporate even governmental self-expression etc. Wow it includes so much!\r\n\r\nI
    do think it is also a craft - at least for the thousands of hobbyists who now
    dabble in it for fun and profit. And even the professionals - what more craftsman-like
    image can you get than an early type designer bent over a bit of metal filing
    away for hours to get the shape he wants? Nowadays he or she would be apron-less,
    clicking away moving points and studying printouts."

  body: "<cite>Is type design graphic design, or industrial design.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    just design. In principle, designing type is no different from designing a chair,
    a door handle, a cloth, a house, a car.\r\n\r\nIn German we term this *Gestaltung*,
    i.e. to lend <cite>Gestalt</cite> to something. In Italian, the craftsman calls
    himself an <cite>artigiano</cite> which word is derived from \u201Cart\u201D \u2013
    now, what is it? I always found the question \u201Cart or craft?\u201D leading
    to nowhere. For me, <cite>Gestaltung</cite> always comprises craft, art and science.\r\n\r\nOr,
    to put it with Vitruvius, who postulated this target for architecture some two
    thousand years ago: <cite>venustas, firmitas, utilitas</cite>. Which is beauty,
    soundness and usefulness. Venustas first, n.b.\r\n\r\n.\r\nMore such Whisky questions,
