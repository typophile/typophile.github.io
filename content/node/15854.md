    volume is sold out and you can only look at it at the National\r\nLibrary in Rome
    and Florence, or try some bibliophiles or rare book\r\nshops like the German Zvab

    body: "Thanks for going to the trouble, Alessandro. I found one book on Griffo
      in an edition of 32 copies, none of which seems to have come up for recent sale.
      I'm all for 'the book beautiful', but such a horendously limited edition seems
      a bit odd given that Aldus was the first printer to exploit the economics of
      the (relatively) large edition.\r\n\r\nGeorge"

    focusing not on the letterform styles but in the more important and less evident
    spacing and measuring method used by Aldus in all levels from letterform proportions
    to page measuring.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed it a lot. It features a lot of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0907259197/ref=sib_rdr_zmin/002-0883116-5836048?p=S025&j=1#reader-page\"

  body: "I am quite late on this thread unfortunately (about two years), but still:
    <a href=\"http://www.ilpolifilo.it/\">Edizioni Il Polifilo</a> of Milano, Italy,
    still sells a book titled <cite><a href=\"http://www.ilpolifilo.it/catalogo.php?idc=24\">Scritti
    di Giovanni Mardersteig sulla storia dei caratteri e della tipografia</a></cite>
    which includes both the <cite>Aldo Manuzio e i caratteri di Francesco Griffo da
    Bologna</cite> essay that was mentioned by John Hudson and another essay titled
    <cite>Il De Aetna di Pietro Bembo</cite> which was originally included in the
    facsimile edition of <cite>De Aetna</cite> done by the Officina Bodoni in 1969.
    The <cite>Aldo Manuzio e i caratteri di Francesco Griffo da Bologna</cite> was
    meant to be part of a book about Griffo that Mardersteig was going to write with
    Stanley Morison, a project that was never finished due to Morison\u2019s passing.\r\n\r\nThe
    book is quite pricey but worth it: it cost me \u20AC110 and you can buy it directly
    from their Web site. It has been printed in 1988 by Stamperia Valdonega on hand-made
    paper in 650 copies (100 not for sale). They still have some copies at Il Polifilo,
    apparently, but of course you will need to be able to read Italian. I studied
    it before going to the Biblioteca Estense here in Modena to actually have a look
    at <cite>De Aetna</cite>, which by the way, is something mind-blowing when you
    actually see it with your own very eyes. The copy they have here in Modena is
    in a miscellanea of other incunabola, which means it\u2019s been detached from
    its original binding and re-bound with other five books: the horror! \r\n\r\nAlso
    of note is that Mardersteig\u2019s facsimile of <cite>De Aetna</cite> was dedicated
    to the recently deceased Morison and that in his honor Mardersteig decided to
    set the original latin text in his Griffo type, and the translation in Bembo.
    The two look quite different, actually. I haven\u2019t seen Mardersteig facsimile,
    it too is available for sale but is extremely expensive, but having seen Griffo
    and Bembo you can tell the difference is very clear.\r\n\r\nI also found on the
    Web the book on Griffo in 32 copies you were mentioning (and I, too, find it outrageous):
    it\u2019s <cite><a href=\"http://www.heavenlymonkey.com/Griffo.htm\">Fragment
    & Glimpses : Francesco Griffo da Bologna</a></cite>, compiled by Rollin Milroy,
    published in 1999 by A Lone Press. "
