  body: "I like it! Is is original, full of motion and yet - I think - adequate for
    text, and legible especially because of the light construction.\r\n\r\nBut don't
    take my word for that - I am not a professional typographer, just a part-time
    aesthete ;-)\r\n\r\nI would like to see more of it, of course.\r\n\r\nMaybe a
    question (which does not even amount to criticism) might be in order: does the
    lowercase b have to be an exact mirror image of the lowercase d?\r\n\r\nBest of
    luck!\r\n\r\nRonald  Kyrmse\r\nronald.info.ms"

  body: One <em>can</em> generate b,d,p, and q all by flipping the same shape around.
    This can be useful for comparing the weights of the individual glyphs for consistency,
    but it is generally regarded as bad practice with regard to actual design, but
    of course there are exceptions to that concept as well. It's not really a hard
    and fast rule; there could be some relationship to how the letters would be drawn
    by hand resulting in differing shapes for these similar letters. In a casual style
    such as this that concept probably should apply, whereas in a rational geometric
    sans (e.g., Futura, Avant Garde) it likely would not, or at least not as strongly.

  body: The only thing I don't like very much is the way tails come out from the strokes.
    Or may be it's the way vertical strokes meet the rounded ones. I'd suggest you
    to check that.
