body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI just wanted to promote my brand new type portfolio: DIEU
  ET MON DROIT.\r\n\r\nIt's gathering some fonts that I've drawn, redrawn, customized
  or tweaked. You might have seen them in a magazine or a corporate identity and wondered
  what the hell was the font!? Otherwise, you'll discover my creations and feel free
  to leave your feedback down there.\r\n\r\nURL: www.dieuetmondroit.co.cc\r\n\r\nEnjoy
  your visit!"

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\n  Just why do you present the type samples on a grey background?
    And why against math paper simulation? It difficults the visualization on those
    thin type strokes.. But I'm just giving my opinion. No grid, grey background optional...
    I would use white to be honest.\r\n  Good work :)"
