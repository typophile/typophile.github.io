  in Yen magazine. I already e-mailed the magazine, but did not hear back from them
  yet. If anyone can identify this it would be of great help!\r\n\r\nIf you can't
  see the attached image, please go to [[http://www.yenmag.net/artaward/index.php]],
  it's the font on the right side of the page, all thin caps, it says YOUNG AUSTRALIAN
  ART AWARD. \r\n\r\nThanks a million! \r\n\r\n"
