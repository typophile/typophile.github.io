<p>Does anyone know the history of this font, and if there is a commercially available version?

The old URL thirstype.com redirects to Village, but Village is no longer selling Thirstype fonts. (I&rsquo;ve contacted Village to see what they have to say.) Meanwhile, [[http://barrydeck.com/original/Barry.Deck.Type.html|this page]] from Barry Deck&rsquo;s old web portfolio links to <a href="http://www.3st.com">www.3st.com</a>—the new web site of Rick Valicenti, founder of Thirstype. But they don&rsquo;t market fonts at all. On top of all that, Chester Jenkins, who used to run Thirstype after Rick, apparently <em>co-founded</em> Village, but the only Thirstype fonts still available on Village are his, now published by the foundry [[http://www.vllg.com/foundries/Constellation#panel=news-gallery-about|Constellation]].

<p>What if someone buys a font, and their computer crashes and the font is lost? In many cases, just go to the vendor and download it again. Or you created a brand identity or logo and the original designer is unavailable or refuses to help. You look for the font, and it&rsquo;s nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>What if the font company goes out of business with no one picking up the assets? What if the font is abandonware? If I needed a font to <em>recreate</em> something already extant, as opposed to just <em>wanting</em> a particular font, there&rsquo;s no telling what I would do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to to be an absolutist, pontificate, and say &ldquo;the worst thing is to help him download from illegal resources, as Renaissance Man did.&rdquo; I understand that people die, companies go bankrupt, foundries are taken over, and shit happens. In those cases, the legitimacy, morality, or legality of recreating a font (&ldquo;outline theft&rdquo;) or downloading from &ldquo;illegal resources&rdquo; is less clear cut. If you want absolutes (and absolution) join the Republican party or the RC church.</p>
<p>I would NOT recommend a questionable source if there was a legitimate alternative.</p>
<p>This is NOT about &ldquo;illegal resources,&rdquo; but what to do when all legitimate sources have dried up.</p>

In other instances, I&rsquo;ve always attempted to contact the original foundry and/or designer, and failing that, looked for another cut of the typeface. (An example: OPTI Majer Irregular is no longer available, and is of questionable origin to start with, but was a legacy font picked by a client before I started working with them. We were able to replace that typeface with Filmotype Major across all uses.)</p>
<p>It is a bit ludicrous in the age of the Internet that legitimate (and paying) users of typefaces can&rsquo;t always find a straightforward way to compensate the owners of the intellectual property. But not doing so is still theft. That being said, a designer who allows their font to go &ldquo;out of print&rdquo; (as opposed to pulling the font because of some defect) is basically throwing money away—while I believe many end users want to do the right thing, most will only do so if it&rsquo;s made painfully easy for them.</p>
<p>And RM, I just saw your reply, and it is a difficult but relevant gray area—what do you do when there are no legitimate options/resources left? Thankfully in this case, it didn&rsquo;t come to that. And that discussion is probably best left to its own thread.</p>

<p>Kudos to Akira for ostensibly finding ways to contact Barry Deck. However, not one of them has an email address or a contact form, although Barry did post a link to &ldquo;the West-Egg biscuits and gravy plate&rdquo; on his website. The Linkedin info essentially duplicates his website info, I&rsquo;m not going to agree to Linkedin&rsquo;s TOS just to &ldquo;access Barry Deck’s full profile,&rdquo; in case it may have contact info, and I don&rsquo;t tweet. Would that Barry followed the motto on his website: &ldquo;Simplify. Scale. Sustain.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t make it simple to contact him, and he did not sustain his own fonts.</p>
<p>That this had a happy ending for David is no reason to be smug and say I told you so. It doesn&rsquo;t address the issue of abandonware, or what to do if all reasonable attempts to make contact fail.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s more gracious of you than at least one person here typically is*, but I feel you&rsquo;re setting the bar conveniently too high. Unless you think people are lying (and why would they?) about being able to contact the relevant parties and finding a proper resolution, once somebody says they found a legitimate means why not give that the benefit of the doubt and remove the illegitimate link? And that&rsquo;s even assuming your stance above is ethical.</p>

<p>The Type ID forum serves not only those looking for an ID but the rest of us. Not letting us all in on the solution is a tease and a disservice.

<ul>
<li>I feel not sharing that info isn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as sharing that Fontzone link.</li>
<li>Indicating that a legitimate solution was -pretty easily- found is plenty of reason to remove that link.</li>
<li>How hard is it to simply contact Village, like David said he did?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what are the grounds for keeping that link up there?</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t feel pressured by me - but do feel pressured by yourself, since I&rsquo;m confident you know what the right thing to do is.</p>
<blockquote>they probably do not have a chance to respond.</blockquote>
<p>Which is clearly not true in this case.</p>
<p>I would look harder to see the real problems here.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I will share the solution to my particular issue (and apologies for not doing it earlier), but I don&rsquo;t want to get bogged down in a larger discussion of abandonware, as I don&rsquo;t think this is the forum for it. (I do think it&rsquo;s a necessary discussion, however, and not always clear-cut.)</p>
<p>In my particular case, I contacted the foundry, and spoke with the principal there. Given his good relationship and history with my client, and the scope of this project (being a single reprint of a long in-print book), he granted me a gratis license for use on this project only. The font is still not commercially available; if I wanted to purchase a new license for a new project, I would have to continue my quest, or find a new typeface. Had I been unsuccessful with the foundry, I would have tried to contact the designer directly. Had all avenues failed, I would have needed to confer with my client on how they wanted to proceed and/or worked directly with the printer to update the files (at a significant expense).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, great to see such an air-tight protocol.</p>
<p>Steve might say (and I would agree) that you solved your dilemma thanks to a privileged position (which does not mean you didn&rsquo;t deserve it). But to me that still doesn&rsquo;t excuse an unauthorized link. To me the only justification for that would be if one believes the designer/distributor has acted in an unethical way, and going against their will is an act of justice.</p>
<p>When a commercial font is pulled from the market, there&rsquo;s usually an honorable reason. Is it bad to reciprocate honorable behavior? And if it&rsquo;s not an honorable reason, does that mean we can/should be dishonorable?</p>
