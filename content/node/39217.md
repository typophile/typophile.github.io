  idea where to begin, so if you guys can look at this link: \r\nhttp://www.interpolnyc.com/extras/wallpapers/wallpaper01_1280x800.jpg
  \ \r\n\r\n-I'm looking for the \"Our love to admire\"-font. It looks kinda customized
  but at least something familiar, especially interested in a font where the M and
  A's is italic, but still regular..\r\n\r\nA swedish magazine called PLAZA use this
  font or something familiar a lot if anyone is familiar with it....\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated! :) \r\n\r\n"
