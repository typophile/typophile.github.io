body: Seems to have transitional features like on the 'd' but I'll be darned if I
  can find a G with that high a waistline...

  body: "I think you're right about Weiss Marc. I think converting the G to outline
    and moving up the 'chin' serif points would give you this G. It also looks like
    maybe the Y has also been tweaked to make the vertical stem shorter.\r\n\r\n-
