    point 26:\r\n\r\n<em>26. \r\nIn January 2004, Hoefler and HTF's attorney Frank
    Martinez presented Frere-Jones with a Sale and Assignment of Type Fonts that transferred
    the Dowry Fonts to HTF. Frere-Jones signed this agreement in March 2004; he was
    not separately represented by counsel. The sale was for nominal consideration
    of $10 and Frere-Jones, who had left Font Bureau, moved to New York and actively
    worked to build HTF, all in reliance on the 50-50 partnership agreement, considered
    signing the document a ministerial act as part of his performance of the original
    bargain with Hoefler. </em>"

    years ago. My \u2018friend' did the business side of our agency and I created.
    Turned out to be a very succesful combination, the company made loads of money,
    which my partner did not want to share. In an effort to clarify the situation
    I offered to bill my hours, which was accepted initially. After the first invoice
    things went really sour and I left and started my own agency. A friend lost and
    a lesson learned.\r\n\r\nWe don't know all the ins and outs of this, but I think
    that the creative input of Tobias merits more than being called \u2018employee'.\r\nSo
    I am rooting for him."

    longtime employee\" seems to be the problem\r\n\r\nFor Immediate Release\r\n17
    January 2014\r\nLast week, designer Tobias Frere-Jones, a longtime employee of
    The Hoefler Type Foundry, Inc. (d/b/a \u201CHoefler & Frere-Jones\u201D), decided
    to leave the company. With Tobias\u2019s departure, the company founded by Jonathan
    Hoefler in 1989 will become known as Hoefler & Co.\r\nFollowing his departure,
    Tobias filed a claim against company founder Jonathan Hoefler. Its allegations
    are not the facts, and they profoundly misrepresent Tobias\u2019s relationship
    with both the company and Jonathan. Whether as The Hoefler Type Foundry, Hoefler
    & Frere-Jones, or Hoefler & Co., our company has always been a great place for
    designers, which is why it\u2019s always been and will continue to be a great
    place for design.\r\nIt goes without saying that all of us are disappointed by
    Tobias\u2019s actions. The company will vigorously defend itself against these
    allegations, which are false and without legal merit. In the meantime, we\u2019re
    all hard at work, continuing to create the kinds of typefaces that designers have
    come to expect from us for more than 25 years."

    cap) vs their revenue and profit and do the math based on a $40M market cap. It
    probably won't tell you anything but might be a way to pass the time. "

  body: "Money and equity aside, it seems the height of unfairness that Tobias looses
    all credit for his superlative work over the last fourteen years, especially the
    work he brought fait accompli to H&FJ such as Whitney. I know you can\u2019t split
    the \u201Cbaby\u201D in a divorce, but Hoefler should not get full credit for
    some else\u2019s creative work, even if Hoefler considers himself the foundry
    that commissioned and managed its development/sale. \r\n\r\nAs many have said,
    there is a lot of misinformation and he-said/he-did-not-say in the media; but
    at least the lawsuit brings light to the situation and voice to Tobias\u2019 perspective
    rather than having this fade to dark without a sound in Hoefler\u2019s favour.\r\n\r\nRegardless
    of written contractual obligations, it seems pretty clear that Hoefler did promise
    a partnership and then reneged; and he appears guilt free in that \u201Cbusiness\u201D
    choice.\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\n\r\nWhat a crazy contract Tobias signed that prevents
    someone from working for a competitor for two years! I hope Tobias can release
    a typeface of his own, as I will do my best to support him. Stay strong; best
    of luck.\r\n\r\nSigned,\r\n<em>Sincerely outraged at something that is none of
