body: Because I hate domestic air travel and would like to save some money, I am thinking
  about driving from DC to Typecon. It looks like about an eight-hour drive in a big
  Mercury with a nice sound system and cushy leather seats. Anyone else want to join
  in, take turns driving, and split gas costs?

  body: If you lock in your airfare now, you may save some coin - my guess is $6 a
    gallon by TypeCon ;-)

    them now) and 56 years of watching pricing fluctuations, if gas goes to 5 bucks
    the American populace will knock back demand therefore depressing prices. But
    if you want to wager a tank of gas on your prediction I will gladly take you up
    on it. I have a Ford 350 tandem diesel!  Just kidding:)"

    train rides in this country (once you get to the Hudson River that is)

  body: I looked at Amtrak, but the schedule claims it takes eight hours to get from
    NYC to Buffalo. Google maps puts the total drive time from DC to Buffalo at seven
    hours and thirty minutes. So driving seems like a better way to go, especially
    with a few drivers taking turns.

    are no delays. The trip was supposedly actually faster in 1901.\r\n\r\n7.5 hours
    from DC to Buffalo? That seems quite optimistic on Google's part. It's a nice
    drive, though -- especially from Pittsburgh to Buffalo. "
