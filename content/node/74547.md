  in 1940 and I was wondering what the fonts are.\r\n\r\nI think the cover is Gill
  Sans - but I'm not certain.\r\n\r\nOn the title page there seems to be something
  like Memphis - but again, I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nThe other serifs I just can't pick
  - but serifs are always what I find hardest to ID.\r\n\r\nAny help would be much
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Simon, the sans on the INSIDE cover (image 2) is W.D. Dwiggins' Metromedium
    with it's Italic cut, which I believe was the inspiration behind Geometric 415
    Medium.\r\nI found this link on the web which shows a scan-to-font version of
    it http://www.eaglefonts.com/metro-medium-oblique-hplhs-ttf-95512.htm\r\n\r\nThe
    text face is I think C.H. Griffith's Excelsior."
