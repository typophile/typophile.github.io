  body: 'I&#39;d just like to comment on the &#34;g&#34;. Although I love the open-bottom
    binocular version &#40;like your second one&#41;, I think there&#39;s some interesting
    potential in the first one: I haven&#39;t seen many examples like that where the
    tail loops counter-clockwise. But I&#39;d make it a smooth curve that ends when
    it touches the left side of the loop. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Hi chris <BR> <BR>yes there is some beauty inside. But stil need a lot of
    work. <BR>The &#39;a&#39;: I would prefere the second, the roman, version. Maybe
    you could try a smaller bowl <BR>The &#39;c&#39;: I always prefer the open characters.
    Do the same for &#39;e&#39; <BR>The &#39;f&#39;: like the nice upstem, but the
    bar isnt at the x-height &#40;also for the &#39;t&#39;&#41; <BR>The &#39;k&#39;:
    hmmm... both dont fit in the font. The first is to straight and second to free...
    <BR>the &#39;w&#39;: dont use the rotated &#39;m&#39; its ugly <BR>the stems of
    v, w, x, y seems to be much bolder  <BR>then the other stems <BR> <BR>so long
    :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Greetings Jens'

  body: Chris -- if anything I would say Cognac needs to be softened just a bit. The
    corners all seem too sharp. Maybe I&#39;m seeing the &#34;humanist&#34; in it
    wanting to come out a bit more??

  body: This looks like it has some uncial flavorings as well. I&#39;m  <BR>talking
    about the flared terminals throughout and the <BR>a, c, e, y and w in particular.  <BR>  <BR>Maybe
    you could talk about your inspiration, or where you  <BR>hope to take this.
