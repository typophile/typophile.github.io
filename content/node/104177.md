  body: "Faces such as Broadway and Hobo were mined from popular styles developed
    by lettering artists.\r\n\r\nNo doubt one person came up with the prototype, but
    after the style had gained some traction in the media, having been swiped/reinterpreted
    by other letterers, than it would have attracted the attention of the new font
    committee at ATF.\r\n\r\nOne can imagine a meeting where a number of different
    examples of a particular style were compared, and a consensus reached as to the
    direction a type based on the style should take. \r\n\r\nA very similar process
    to how many custom types are commissioned today. Back then at ATF, the draftsperson
    \ was not credited, but now, if the work is supplied by an \u201Cindependent\u201D
    foundry, that person may well be credited as the designer.\r\n\r\nIf the expectation
    is that authorship in type design belongs to the draftsperson, then we can say
    that that person is the designer.\r\n\r\nBut if the situation is more like modern
    art in the present, conceptual era, where the idea is the main thing not the making,
    which may often be done by anonymous artisans, then the author may be considered
    the artist or art director, whether or not he/she does the drawing. "

    available for a long time. \r\n\r\nSign paintings and hand lettering are not type.
    Being a sign painter or a letterer and having a style, does not make your style
    a typeface. Making fonts in metal type, required type design and Benton was about
    the best.\r\n\r\nYet, this funny question keeps coming up, how much of a \"type
    designer\", was this guy responsible for 1,000s of fonts when it took a year for
    each... and he did not live to 1,000. \r\n\r\nHmmm.\r\n\r\n "

  body: "David, ATF was a factory with division of labour commensurate with its size.\r\n\r\nThat
    is why the design of type was split into different segments along the production
    process, and why it was possible for Morris Benton to art direct so many typeface
    designs, just as Cedric Gibbons art directed all those movies for MGM.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    a different notion of design than the hands-on craftsmanship practised by Fred
    Goudy (in the latter part of his career), and by those with Fontographer in the
    1990s.\r\n\r\nIf one expects a proper type designer to be drawing the prototype
    of each letter, then Benton was riding on the coat-tails of others who did the
    hand work\u2014and that is why he has not been raised in the pantheon along side
    Cooper, Goudy and Dwiggins. We like to see some artistry in type design, and associate
    it with individual authorship, not the impersonality of industrial production
    and the assembly line. However, if one approaches design as a more conceptual
    kind of work, then someone like Benton deserves more recognition.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/graphic-arts-and-crafts-year-book-1910-376-atf-factory-0600rgb-rot0p3cw-crop-factory-2852x2692-scale-512x483_3708.jpg]"

    of type was not split up with the production. What do you think happened in this
    process?\r\n\r\nAnd, when you label Benton as the \"art director\" at a company
    just making fonts, you lose me. What does an art director do when fonts are the
    only product?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "David, I\u2019m on topic.\r\nThe issue is, how much work\u2014both conceptual
    and production\u2014does someone have to do to be considered the designer of a
    typeface?\r\n\r\nBenton\u2019s reputation has suffered because he was the \u201Cart
    director\u201D at ATF.\r\nCompare with Goudy, Cooper and Dwiggins, whose lettering
    work demonstrated their hand skills, and whose type designs were their own original
    concepts (mostly).\r\n\r\nBenton\u2019s work was conceptually subtler and more
    adaptive than Goudy, Cooper and Dwiggins; there is no record of his handwork (AFAIK);
    and at ATF there was a production line where unaccredited draftspersons produced
    the glyph drawings, under his art direction.\r\n\r\nWe have letters between Dwiggins
    and Griffiths discussing the implementation of WAD\u2019s drawings, but are there
    production notes from ATF concerning any of Benton\u2019s faces? Where are his
    sketches?\r\n\r\nConsider also the relationship between Hermann Zapf and August
    Rosenberger. Had Zapf not been involved in the production of Palatino, but Rosenberger
    had adapted it from his lettering (as Slimbach adapted Ca\uFB02isch), would Rosenberger
    have been considered the designer of the typeface?\r\n\r\nZapf and Frutiger both
    did very little work on the \u201CNova\u201D versions of their faces executed
    by Kobayashi, they art directed, I would say. For instance, in the old style \uFB01gures
    for Frutiger Nova, Frutiger had sketched the \uFB01gures extremely roughly, with
    \u201C4\u201D standing on the baseline, no descender. Kobayashi corrected that.\r\n\r\nThe
    assignation of authorship is not as simple as \u201Cwho does what\u201D.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nOne
    can have it both ways.\r\nIf one draws a revival, one is called the designer of
    the new typeface, even if one is careful to credit the original and not call oneself
    the designer.\r\nAnd yet if one does sketches for an original design, and art
    directs someone else doing the drawing, one may still be considered the designer
    of the new typeface.\r\nFollow the money.\r\n\r\nStanley Morison admitted to having
    \u201Cexcogitated\u201D Times New Roman, but was for many years credited as the
    designer. Now wiki says he commissioned it, and Victor Lardent drew it. So nobody
    designed it!\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nOver the years, the action in the arts has shifted
    from making, through direction, to curation.\r\nJanet Cardiff\u2019s <em>Forty
    Part Motet</em> is a piece of installation art, in which she neither composed
    nor performed the music, or made the loudspeakers. It was her idea.\r\nIf that
    is how things are now in the art world, I would say this article has it wrong,
    and that Morris Benton will be getting more recognition in the font world, as
    a type designer, on those terms."

    do you think the two can be separated, in the case of Benton?\r\nHis way of designing
    type was very much caught up with, and developed within, the context of the large
    industrial establishment in which has father played so prominent a role as an
    inventor.\r\nBear in mind that his degree was in engineering, so he did not develop
    as a type designer in the manner of the commercial artist \u2014 the path followed
    by his more famous contemporaries. One important part of that was that they were
    of necessity self-promoters, which he, as a corporate man not a freelancer in
    trade, didn\u2019t have to be.\r\n\r\nIf he had an antipathy, for whatever reason,
    towards presenting himself as a professionally creative individual, well, he has
    certainly been able to fool most of the people most of the time, including Rick
    von Holdt.\r\n\r\n"

    etc. that brought it all together and produced results -- and credit for Edison.\r\nSo
