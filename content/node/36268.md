  here and have to say I am very impressed by all of you and your knowledge. \r\n\r\nI
  have just saw a few clips on Youtube for the Helvetica documentary and I loved many
  points that were made in the interviews. The one that stuck with me most was, the
  choice not to choose (other faces). They chose Helvetica. I thought that was very
  smart and started me thinking about my own situation. I am an Art Director in London
  for a major client. Most of my work is done online but if I sell well I sometimes
  get to push the above line stuff. What I have been thinking about doing for a long
  time now is, to design a font for my client that would hopefully become synonymous
  with its brand. The brand is worked on by many designers globally I would like to
  take away the choice like the designers in the Helvetica documentary. I hope this
  doesnt make me sound like the asshole I think it does ;)\r\n\r\nMy question to everyone
  here is... where do I begin? I havent designed a fontface since art school in Toronto
  12 yrs ago and that was on paper. Is there standard software for this? Is there
  any popular freeware I could begin with? "

  body: FontForge is open source (which technically isn't freeware - it's better).
    You can get it at <a href="http://fontforge.sf.net/">fontforge.sf.net</a>. Some
    in this forum don't like it, but it has improved a lot recently, and is always
    improving. I've never really used anything else (besides a brief and not particularly
    fruitful encounter with Font Creator, which isn't free), but I like FontForge
    a lot.

  body: "I am an aspiring software, and after trying to get by with less able Font
    Software for a while, I\u2019ve decided to move to Fontlab. Fontlab really gives
    a designer just about everything he needs to draw and output a great font, with
    lesser tools I was spending a lot of time jumping into Illustrator to try and
    get things done. Fontographer has most of the great drawing tools, but it also
    has a lot of nasty old bugs that won\u2019t be fixed until Fontlab has managed
    to finished Fontographer 5, so I end up going to Fontlab just to stay away from
    those issues."

    has a $99 product called <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/\">TypeTool</a>
    which is an introductory version of FontLab Studio. Assuming that the alternatives
    don\u2019t suit you, you could get started with that and then move on to FontLab
    Studio once you feel you\u2019ve reached its limitations."

  body: "I think it was probably 1993 when I first dabbled in font creation with Fontographer.
    For whatever reason my enthusiasm waned after a few years, and it wasn't until
    November of 2006 that I took it up again. I initially bought the Fontographer
    upgrade. Later I upgraded to FontLab Studio to get support for OpenType. So far
    it's been an enjoyable experience. Leslie Cabarga's book \"Learn FontLab Fast\"
    was a big help in getting up to speed. I don't consider myself to be in the same
    league with the gurus here, but I hope someday to sell some of the work I'm doing.
    My abilities are much improved over what they were in the 90s. I still do most
    of my work in Illustrator and then bring it into FontLab Studio for tweaking.\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't worry too much about the software. It's not that hard to learn. Coming
    up with the font is going to be the difficult part, but I'm guessing you already
    have a concept drawn up that you are happy with. Otherwise you wouldn't be so
    confident about forcing other people to use it. :-)"

    a new multi-lingual branding typeface for a \"major client\", using free or cheap
    software and your only type design expereince was 12 years ago in school in Canada?
    \r\n\r\nIf making a branding typeface for this or any other client really is your
    life's ambition my feeling here is that you don't need software, you need training.
    Maybe the MA course at Reading? But if I were in your shoes I'd look for a local,
    professional, established type designer who could transform your ideas (maybe
    sketched in Illustrator or on paper) into a high-quality typeface. \r\n\r\nCheers,

  body: "Si, absolutely. I mean no disrespect to the people who dedicate themselves
    to font design by implying I can just pick up any tool and throw out a face, especially
    with my knowledge of face design. But it has always been something Ive been quite
    interested in my whole career and I continuously am looking at the work of my
    team and peers to assess face choices, typography etc. My idea was to simply begin
    teaching myself font design and tie in my client as a motivator.\r\n\r\nAs for
    all the suggestions, thanks a ton. I downloaded the fontlab demo and it seems
    pretty slick. I have already kicked out a spastic altered version of garamond
    and installed it successfully.  I guess a question I should be asking is, what
    is a good resource on the basics of face design?"

    out Typowiki before opening my mouth. I think I have put together my first idea
    for a font (thats outside of mu client) just to get familiar with the concepting,
    designing and building of a face. I can see this getting very addictive. Thanks
    again. I have so many questions though that I dont want to spam in the forums
    as they may seem to be common sensed to many of you. Is there anyone out there
    that is willing to answer a bunch of questions I have via email?

    multiple points of view - so I suggest that you post individual questions and
    see what response you get to them.\r\n\r\nI also want to echo Si's sentiments
    that if you want to make a custom face for a client soon ( Say in less than 2
    years or more ) you might be better off partnering with an individual or a type
    group. There are many options and a great deal of skill to lean into. Doing that
    could be a great education in itself. \r\n\r\nI also want to caution you against
    altering a face to create a new one. They almost never feel right or add value
    - pretty much the reverse. Drawing from scratch is the way to go.\r\n\r\nYou are
    right. This is addictive stuff. \r\n\r\n"
