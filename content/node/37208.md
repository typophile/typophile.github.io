  to had a chance to sign up for this class. It starts September 30.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nI
  wanted to let everyone know that there is a great class starting in the fall at
  Cooper Union.\r\n\r\nI have been taking private classes with Hannes Famira, and
  it has been hugely beneficial to my development as a type designer.\r\n\r\nI went
  from barely clunking around in FontLab to producing a type family which was accepted
  by FontShop and Village, the latter of whom I will distributing with.\r\n\r\nI recommend
  it to anyone in the New York area who is serious about type.\r\n\r\nYou can register
  for his class here: http://www.cooper.edu/ce/calligph.html#p105\r\n\r\nAnd learn
  more about Hannes and his teaching philosophy here: http://www.typedu.org\r\n\r\nJeremy\r\n\r\nrss"
