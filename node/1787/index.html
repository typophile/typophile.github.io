<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm working on a logotype for a company whose name consists of 20 characters across three words. The client would like the design to be entirely horizontal (without line breaks). It will need to work across a variety of media including web, signage, vehicles (vans), clothing, and print (mostly flyers & brochures). <br> <br>My initial thought was that a heavy, black, or extra condensed sans face would be best due to the many characters (22 with spaces). I'm also leaning toward all caps and italics for reasons having to due with evenness (type color) and the brand's strong associations with movement/motion/activity. <br> <br>While I'm able to see what looks good on screen and at 1200dpi from my B&W laser, I'm somewhat unsure about the implications of the aforementioned typographic choices when it comes to the other media I mentioned (esp. signage & vehicles). <br> <br>However, when I set the type in a gothic (not condensed) place it next to a black condensed sans and pump up the point size - my eye is definitely drawn to the gothic from way across the room. <br> <br>Hence, I leave my query with the Oracle at Typophile in hopes that I may be enlightened. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>How much larger is "much larger"? <br> <br>1" 2" 3" 4" 5" 6" 10" ? <br> <br>The only real way to discover how they will perform at much larger sizes, is to make them at the target size and view them under target conditions. <br> <br>Depending on the viewing distance of the target size, you may have to open up the letterspace. <br> <br>Also if we are talking about real distance viewing the C in both designs closes in on itself and is too close in shape to the O.</div>

<div class=commentbody>One more thing, mixed cases will help with both the length and the readability. I don't feel that all caps adds anything to communicate speed that could not be achieved with mixed case. <br> <br>If its a matter of even color, you could redraw the caps to more closely balance the lowercase.</div>

<div class=commentbody>One thought is to run the words together and change the middle words color or tint of solid color or change the weight of the middle word. Might also experiment with a condensed face if in all caps. You might also propose using the Initials of the Company as the logo and use the name small under them. Your example would be BCC large and Bike Cruiser Company small.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You could test your photoshop skills by snapping some photos of signs & vans & dropping in your logo. Not as accurate as James' method, but it's cheaper & quicker & it'll get you in the ballpark. A really long logo like that is difficult to work with; if nothing else, a photoshop demo will show your client what challenges you are up against if your logo has a 14:1 width-to-height ratio. <br> <br>You could also present your logo in 3 versions, printed matter, "outdoor" & web. All 3 media have different issues, so it's appropriate to have 3 solutions, i.e., one line for printed matter, 3 lines for "outdoor", & a less-bold version for web. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The only thing the photoshop exercise will do is show you how they might look in those environments. It will not tell you how they perform in those environments. And in truth it may never get you in the ballpark. <br> <br>You are interested in how the design performs aren't you?</div>

Let me try and respond to each of your excellent comments. <br> <br>JAMES (BTW, your typefaces are absolutely AMAZING) <br> <br>In regards to size, I'm actually not sure. I</div>

<div class=commentbody>James: <br> <br>>And in truth it may never get you in the ballpark. <br> <br>Well, yeah. I worked for a long time at a human-services non-profit. (Typical budget discussion: "You're stealing bread from the mouths of homeless mothers and children!") Reflexively, I go for the low-budget (or no-budget) solution. :0) <br> <br>Tim: good luck! Keep us posted. <br> <br></div>
