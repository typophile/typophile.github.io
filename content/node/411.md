body: I needed to create a &#34;fax&#34; bitmap face for a project I&#39;m working
  on. I got perhaps excessively creative -- it isn&#39;t quite as faithful to real
  fax characters &#40;I mean the date and time stamps that appear on faxes&#41;. Anyway,
  this was what I ended up with. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1204.jpg"
