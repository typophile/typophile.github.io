  body: Dang, I remember a thread a few months back with a link to a very obnoxious
    site that had a ton of pixel fonts - some good ones - but I can&#39;t find it,

    order to view each font. Anybody else know what I&#39;m talking about?

  body: Patty, I know what you&#39;re talking about!  We had a whole discussion about
    horrible flash sites then... but I can&#39;t recall it either!

    the same, though.
