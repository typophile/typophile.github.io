body: "Does inDesign have a feature which would enable me to control the line lenght?
  I'd like to be able to control how deep/shallow the rag is.\r\n\r\nFor example if
  I have a paragraph of text which is aligned flush-left (ragged-right), can I specify
  a maximum rag (or minimum lenght) before it hyphenates? \r\n\r\nHow about the same
  thing in Quark?"

  body: I don't know of a setting to set specific limits, but there is a "balance
    ragged lines" option in the Paragraph Palette menu.

  body: Boole why not just specify the width of the box containing your type? As for
    using "balance ragged lines" option (it stinks), it makes all the lines short.
    If the lines have to be a specific length you will have to use a justified paragraph
    or you will have to manually adjust each line.

  body: "In Quark there is an option in the H&Js pallette called Hyphenation Zone
    which works from the righthand margin. It will hyphenate a word when  the previous
    word ends before the Hyphenation Zone and an acceptable hyphenation point falls
    within the Hyphenation Zone.\r\nTim"

  body: The closest InDesign comes to letting you control line lengths in rags is
    the "Hyphenation Zone" settings in the Hyphenation settings (you get to it from
    the Paragraph or Control palette menu). Words that overlap the "zone" that you
    specify either get hyphenated or bumped down, depending. Hyphenation Zone settings
    are often overriden by the Paragraph Composer. Thomas Phinney (from memory) said
    that the multi-line Paragraph Composer softens a rag.
