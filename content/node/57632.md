  after installing the fonts in fonts folder, fonts will work in MS Office Application
  but I want them to be hidden in Fonts Menu. Becoz its around 600 fonts and the menu
  list goes to much long & long.\r\nSometimes ago I read somewhere that with some
  other font extension instead of .ttf or .otf etc. the font will work in Windows
  applications but font name will not appear in MS Office Font Menu Bar.\r\nHelp needed
  if its possible, Thanks"
