<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm currently rounding up the design of a custom font I've been working on, called <a href=http://www.characters.nl>Siventi</a>. I want to go and set up a licence agreement for the usage of the font. The client wants to have the licence forever, but will not pay that much for it. I will keep all the rights on distributing the font. In the future it might be so that other companies working for Siventi will need to have the font. They will then buy it from me and that money is mine to have. But that is Mickey Mouse-money, really.
Since I've never did this before or licenced a font myself, I would like to ask if there is anyone willing to share a licence agreement with me. Since this is a custom licence I guess the standard EULA is not enough.
I don't know if this is something you wish to keep a secret. I hope not. You would really help me a lot with this.
I don't need to know anything on pricing, but just want to get the contract in order.
We can make a trade? I'll give you one of my fonts for free. Just pick any you want...
Regards,
®ené</div>

Yup, that was the bit I was writing about. I'd leave that out, or define "similar" in a way that's measurable. To the judge all fonts look the same anyway.

<div class=commentbody>That's way too lame of an agreement. You should have a laywer draft a proper document. Custom font licenses are no place for do-it-yourselfers. As a point of reference regarding trade, you will have to pay an attorney between $1000 and $3000 to draft for a proper license. You can then reuse it on all your custom work. Do you have that much to trade?
By the way, I am not interested in any trades, just to be clear. I'm just offering an opinion.</div>

<div class=commentbody>James, I definitely have not that kinda money to have an attorney draft a proper license for me. I don't even have the paying customers yet that makes it worth while having a good license made.
I just thought these kind of contracts were 'standard' and most people use them like that. I would also not go to a attorney to have him set up a EULA for me, because they are almost all the same. You can personalise and finetune it, but to have an attorny make it from scratch?
The trade was just a trigger to see if anyone would react to my question. I've realised that on Typophile everyone is very willing to help out when it comes to the actual technical construction of the fonts. But when it comes to more commercial questions, the willingness to be open and helpfull becomes smaller.
I can understand that you should be carefull with giving out prices to potential competition, so I don't ask for that. This also depends on the clients demands, speed, quality, service, etc. of the typographer in question.
But helping eachother to get set up with finding the right foundries, contracts & licenses, copyrights, etc, are for me just as important then to get that particular glyph right.
I've made a similar experience at the Art Academy where I studied. They teach you everything you want to know about design, but nothing that you need when you want to work outside their ivory walls. Businesswise they didn't teach us anything.
Me and a friend started even while studying at the academy with our own studio. I can't tell you how many mistakes we made, because we just didn't know. Over 75% of these mistakes were unnccesairy if someone had just helped us out. The studio is now 10 years old and we're doing really well. But it could have been a lot easier.

<div class=commentbody>I appreciate that you don't have the funds for an attorney to draft your license, but I have to disagree that all licenses are more or less standard. At TypeCon in NY, Frank Martinez (a lawyer specializing in licensing, contracts and IP) made the case that EULAs and any type of font license are really a intergral component of the type makers business plan. I don't think every type make has the same business model, so I don't think every license will be standard.
At TypeCon NY, Bruno Steinert of Linotype offered anyone who wanted to, the freedon to copy LinoType's EULA, perhaps there is where you should start.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree. That's what I meant with 'standard', so I guess I didn't explain myself clear enough. With standard I mean that some paragraphs would/could be the same as others, but then you have to put your own business plan in (finetune it).
You don't have to invent the wheel completely new, but make sure that you have the right tires on it.
Most of my fonts are sold through other foundries, so I'd go for the basis EULA. If I would sell them myself I would personalise it more.
It's a great offer to start with the LinoType EULA. With this you're at least 'safe'. Later on I will have a lawyer draw up my own EULA. But first I need to make a little bit of money with my fonts.
Thanks for the tips,
®ené

<div class=commentbody>I don't know if you would be at least "safe" by adopting Lino's EULA. That EULA would have to represent in some way, your philosophy of doing business. Only you can decide that.
Remember that a license or contract is written for three entities, the foundry, the end user and the court (again thank you Frank Martinez). The court being the most important one. In US law, any unclear statements in a contract are the responsibility of the contract writer. So if your license fails to explain clearly what all the terms are, you, the foundry will be the one penalized in any legal decision.
On a separate matter, I'd like to see you drop the advertising signature from your posts here. But perhaps that is part of your business plan.</div>

<div class=commentbody>No problem. It actually is part of my business plan. But it's not something that I wouldn't change if it bothers people. Do you also mind my icon? Nick Shin was unhappy with it.

<div class=commentbody>I guess here in Holland it's the same in court. So I think I will invest my money in my EULA first. So I'd be prepared for the moment when I need it.

Indeed, but to some extent this is understandable of course. I'm sure you join me in appreciating the technical help that some experts <strong>are</strong> willing to graciously provide.

René's request went unanswered for SEVERAL days; perhaps some of the critics of the document presented should have stepped in earlier with documents of their own.
But, perhaps more important, this document is <strong>not</strong> a EULA; it is essentially a quitclaim deed. The Proprietor is permanently assigning all rights to the Partner -- that is the sole purpose, and anything else EULA-like is entirely unnecessary.</div>
