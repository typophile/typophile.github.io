    the flow of the line connecting to \"joy\"."

  body: "Holiday is very abstract and difficult to communicate. There is nothing about
    the home to suggest its in a holiday season.\r\n\r\nI concur with riccard0 that
    is conveys spring or family."

  body: Do you think just changing the colors would help...like white paper and maybe
    an ice blue house or maybe change the word from joy to merry? Open to any suggestions...

  body: "To convey \"Holiday,\" I would remove the red berries(?) from the tree. And
    maybe change the tree to a light blue and make the bird red.\r\n\r\nBecause you're
    in Florida, your concept of winter is a little different than mine, being in Boston.
    While you might think of birds arriving \"home\" in the winter, I think of them
    leaving. I mentioned making the bird red because cardinals are one of the few
    bird species that sticks around here in the winter(or at least is active in the
    winter). \r\n\r\nI also think that if you send this around the Holidays, it would
    have more of a Holiday feel just because of the context. If I showed you a shade
    of blue in the summer, you might think of the sky; but in the winter, the same
    shade might remind you of snow."

  body: "Wow, my grammer in my last post was horrible, huh? I think I meant to say
    \"you've definitely made it look more...\" but I got distracted in the middle
    of it. You got the idea though.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I liked the composition
    in your first iteration better."

  body: Now I'm afraid that the style of the tree doesn't match the birdhouse/bird.
    The tree is too "realistic" and intricate, whereas the birdhouse is bolder, more
    abstract and primitive (in a good way).

  body: "I also prefer the first one, but perhaps you can make \u2018joy\u2019 larger
    - it is overwhelmed currently. Would help both compositionally and on a communication
    level, and also make it more festive. To that same end - the swirling of the ribbon
    can be a lot more involved."
