  (The site is still in designing phase and not complete).\r\n\r\nThe fonts used:\r\n\r\nJeanne
  Moderno Ultra by Steve Mehallo for the page heading\r\n\r\nJeanne Moderno Titling
  Italic by Steve Mehallo for the page subheading\r\n\r\nFF Tisa Web Pro by FontFont
  for the headlines\r\n\r\nRatio by ps Type for the body text, social icons labels
  and  timer labes (days, hours etc.)\r\n\r\nLFT Etica Display Web by TypeTogether
  for the timer numbers.\r\n\r\nAll fonts are from the Typekit library.\r\n\r\nI am
  not completely sure about the headlines / body text pair.\r\n\r\nAll opinions are
  really appreciated."

  body: "I don't mind a lot of fonts, well hierarchied, and am impressed you have
    the hutzpah to use one of the very few \"Unicase with small unicase\" typefaces
    for your main style!\r\n\r\nHowever, the main subhead is a bit off. It is distinguished
    by size, position and color, so a separate font/style is not necessary.\r\nAlso,
    the countdown numbers are odd as the only sans on the page, and don't seem \"techy\"
    enough if you are using them in an illustrative, denotative manner; they also
    don't sit very comfortably on the convex gradiented surface."
