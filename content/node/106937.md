  client, I'm looking for a modern typeface with an historical reference, possibly
  to Goudy Old Style or similar. On top of that, it would be a huge added bonus if
  the typeface had an LA ligature or an alternate for a capital K. Any suggestions?

    in the world of academe..namely, the Alumni Magazine. What happened to Betty Sue,
    class reunions, how the cheerleaders on the football team dress this year, etc.\r\n\r\nYou
    sure that's what you're aiming at?"

      one which I have posed here is specifically to highlight the client's steep
      academic tradition. I'm not sure I understand your questioning. Can you elaborate?
      \r\n\r\nNick, thank you. I'll keep that in mind as I search. "

  body: "I thought I was quite clear, if, perhaps, a little snotty. The academic side
    of the university -- the English dept, the History dept, etc., tends to look on
    Goudy Oldstyle with about as much favor as they would with using Wedding Text
    to set the <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>.\r\n\r\nThe marketing side of the university,
    which sells athletics and remembrance of good times rather than anything academic,
    usually has a different viewpoint.\r\n\r\nIt would depend on which side of the
    educational institution your client falls into."

    side of the university? OK, but I spent too many years on both sides of that one.\r\n\r\nAs
    the panthers would say, Esse quam videri, baby. Just be sure what the client wants."

  body: "The calligraphic nature of Goudy plays well with my intentions. However,
    it is too old-fashioned and overused. You'll see when I posed my question that
    I'm on the hunt for a more modern typeface with similar qualities. \r\n\r\nYour
    comments were indeed snotty. Not to mention completely unhelpful. "

  body: "Well, maybe I can try to be slightly more directly helpful. When you say
    \"a historical reference,\" what period historically are you referencing?\r\n\r\nGoudy's
    faces, though they are based on historical models, are very much his own style
    and clearly identifiable as such, which place them as early twentieth-century
    American. (Which, actually, means that the historical implications are exactly
    right for Sarah Lawrence, though I somewhat doubt that the designers were thinking
    along those lines.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, let us know more specifically what you're trying
    to reference and we can help you better."
