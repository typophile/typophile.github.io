<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Dear Typophiles,
I am wondering if there is a somewhat "complete" (ha-ha...) overview of small type foundries and their – often so excellent but hardly noticable – fonts, that makes it easier to find something "special" aside the beaten path of big foundries like linotype, fontfont, etc.
Background story: I criticized the designs of a friend of mine because he always uses always the same, "boring" fonts. I mean, the most innovative thing he did was to use Myriad instead of Frutiger... But his arument was that it took him way too much time to find special fonts that would fit better because he first needs to know about the different foundries, look whether they have something useful for the job, make sure that it quality work (in design, extent, technical aspects), and often purchase is somewhat more difficult than with the well-known big foundries (because he is used to them).
Does one really need to be an "insider" in fontdesign to know "small" things like (just for example) MacRhino-Fonts, Storm Type, etc.? Is there a book, website, etc. that is specialized on these foundries, getting an overview of independent works? Myfonts is okay, but there, the big players are present as well, which is okay, but makes things too vast. Of course I can propose some things to him sometimes, but I'm not omniscient, up-to-date, and I'm not a tell-me-the-perfect-font-answering-machine.
Thanks for your help
Sebastian</div>

<div class=commentbody>The two Indie Fonts books are very good, and are for sale in bookstores all over Europe, or online, of course ;-)
Both Indie Fonts and Indie Fonts 2 are beautifully-bound type specimen books, more equisitely-designed than almost any catalogues made since the 1930s. They are sold at good prices, too, especially since they have been out of a little bit now.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sebastian,
You could also make a list with the URL of your favourites (thanks for mentioning mine) and youst send that to your friend. I would say he needs about 5 minutes to judge weather he think MRF is good or bad in his opinion. All my retail typefaces have pdf-specimen for download. I still carry a small amount of printed catalogues which could be sent for a $12 + p&p. This goes for most of the other indie foundries as well. If you supply him with just a tiny list, you could open new doors for your friend.
Many diesign sites also carries foundry lists. Netdiver, Icograda etc etc
At least a start...
Cheers</div>

<div class=commentbody>While it's good to have ten to twelve fonts that you use on a regular basis, your friend sounds a little lazy. It may cost a little bit of money, but it might not be a bad idea to get some kind of collection with a good number of fonts to start with. I know it's one of the "big guys" and not one of the indie firms, but <a href=http://store.adobe.com/type/collections.html>Adobe's collections</a> might be a good place to start.
Are you considering firms like Emigre and House to be big firms?</div>

<div class=commentbody>You could just connect him with 3-5 suppliers (could be designers, foundries, resellers) whose products are consistently high-quality, which have simple online purchasing options, whose designs are fresh, and which offer a good variety. Even if a few foundries get left out, it would be a good start for someone like your friend who is apparently cut off from the vibrant options available now.
Quality of product (complete character sets, good digitization, expert spacing & kerning, robust, versatile families, reliable font performance, etc.) should be a primary criterion. Not every small foundry is able to provide this level of quality. Not to mention originality of design.
Suggestions:
Storm
House
H&F-J
Village
Feliciano
FontBureau
Device
OurType
Jim Parkinson
Josh Darden
Don't throw a huge list at him. If you picked 4 from this list, whose products don't overlap much in style, then it would be a big boost to his options, but not overwhelming. If several are reselling through fonts.com or myfonts, then all the easier. It might turn out to be a great intro for him to the wide world of indie fonts. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I wrote a magazine <a href=http://www.shinntype.com/Assets/Depts/Essays/Cruisin.pdf>article</a> about this 4 or five years ago, and there have been many books published -- but they are almost all out of date, because things have changed so much in the last few years, especially with OpenType.
I still think printed specimens give you the best view, so yes, Indie Fonts is good. There will be a new FontBook soon. Veer has done some nice specimens, which include the foundries it distributes.

<div class=commentbody>I'll third the support for the Indie Fonts set, good enough just to flip through and enjoy the specimens/layouts when you have a few minutes to spare. I'm also excited about the new FontBook, as it should be quite comprehensive.</div>
