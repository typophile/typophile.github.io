    even though I've never had the privilege of doing one myself!

  body: "Yes. I have seen it. Super. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc64ycPmSqo\">This
    one</a> is also too good. It makes me wonder about the logistics involved on doing
    something like that. As far as I know, the Gutenberg Bible is comprised of two
    volumes. Correct me if I am wrong. Imagine only the the size of the place where
    the printed signatures would be 'sitting', awaiting to be touched by the bookbinder.
    Even in a ultra fast printing company, printing a book with two thousand pages
    is not simple. Now, imagine it being all done by hand.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n\r\n"

    or how to get something done?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking this might be a beautiful touch
    for wedding invitations or graduation announcements.\r\n\r\nWhat documents would
    you get printed this way if you had the chance?"
