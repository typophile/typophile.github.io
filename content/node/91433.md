body: "What follows is the text of a recent post (by \"Character\") to comp.fonts.\r\n\r\nThe
  Solopedia Project\r\n\r\nA compendium of digital fonts that match the typefaces
  displayed in \"The Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display Typefaces\" (1992, by Dan X.
  Solo, Dover Publications, 1992)\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 2009, \"Fontana\" issued
  a spreadsheet containing a list of the typefaces contained in the Solotype Catalog.
  At the same time, \"Character\" was preparing a similar concordance, which wasn't
  nearly as far along as Fontana's, so her spreadsheet became the template for the
  project.\r\n\r\nSince then Character has taken the reins, and with the contributions,
  ideas, and assistance of many others, has been publishing an updated version monthly.
  This is posted to alt.binaries.fonts (a usenet group) and to annexcafe.fonts (a
  newsgroup on a stand-alone news server).\r\n\r\nThe name \"Solopedia\" was suggested
  by \"La Vie Dansante\" and has since become the name generally used for the spreadsheet,
  the project and associated web pages.\r\n\r\nA web-friendly current version of the
  Solopedia can be found at: http://fontek.fateback.com/\r\n\r\nThere are also related
  pages that include references to all of Dan Solo's Alphabet books, http://fontek.fateback.com/alphabet_book_fonts.htm
  \r\n\r\nNo organized search for fonts matching those in the alphabet books has been
  undertaken; many of the alphabets are already represented in the Solotype Catalog.\r\n\r\nNote
  that except as designers and foundries are listed in the Solopedia, this is not
  a source for the identified digital versions. The fontek website has added many
  links to commercial distributors such as MyFonts, and links to sources for the numerous
  legitimately free fonts that have been identified. Some of these free fonts have
  been created as a result of the Solopedia Project, as have some commercial fonts.\r\n\r\nIn
  March, 2012, in Annexcafe.fonts, \"Tommy\" asked about the goal of the Solopedia,
  to which Fontana provided the following eloquent response:\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \r\n\r\nFWIW: Here is a little about the emotion and affection I think is helping
  to sustain the Solopedia project.\r\n\r\nWhatever its flaws, the once widely-circulated
  and affordable Dover-published \"Solotype Catalog ..\" was either the original introduction
  (or one of several introductory sources) for typeface appreciation and desire for
  many hobbyists. Without exhaustive coverage (impossible), that publication successfully
  communicated the idea that typefaces exist in astonishing variety and that studying
  them can be fascinating and fun. It still gives me a smile just to flip through
  its pages. (Or maybe I am just easily amused?)\r\n\r\nFor one, I did not even realize
  at the time I encountered the Solocat that other typeface catalogs even existed.
  (Silly ignorance; typesetting and print shops had to buy them somewhere.) The idea
  that there might be access to digital versions of many, even most of the quirky
  faces for play or even practical purposes seemed almost too good to be true. Not
  only has the project already located more digital equivalents than any of the participants
  once thought possible, but it has spurred a number of volunteers more talented than
  I to create over a hundred new digitizations of Solo faces where none previously
  existed. Unexpected delight.\r\n\r\nCollecting free and affordable typefaces appeals
  to me more than collecting insects, matchbooks, coins, stamps, or a variety of other
  collectibles -- though perhaps for some of the same reasons that collectors in those
  hobbies are excited about their interest. Once \"hooked\" on the idea, the project
  apparently seems self-evidently worthwhile to a number of the participants. I much
  appreciate how much farther it has developed collectively than any of us could have
  taken it as a (pun intended) solo task. A pleasant shock.\r\n\r\nI am guardedly
  hoping that someday someone will at least discover and share the provenance of the
  mystery faces from pages 192 to 202. Though some are standards, and some look like
  they could be from a single vendor collection, others among them don't produce a
  single Google hit, and don't seem to match designs known by other names. A few examples:
  British, Callorte, Clova, Hotspur, Jaeger, Lothario, Monkton, Rivington.  [Ed. note:
  Digitized matches for British, Callorte, Jaeger, Lothario, and Monkton,  have since
  been found. Fontana herself found a light version of Hotspur.]\r\n\r\nThe typeface
  community seems populated by friendly, intelligent, helpful, generous people with
  a great sense of humor. Sometimes a visit is a warm vacation from a colder, harsher
  world. Contributing to the hobby can be a way to virtually hang out with these good
  folk. Wow, if I wax any more poetic I'll have to switch to iambic pentameter or
  add a music track.\r\n\r\nHugs to whomever wants them.\r\n\r\n     Fontana --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAdditional
  matches are more than welcome. Information can be posted here; use the work Solopedia
  in the subject.\r\n\r\n   - Herb\r\n"

    fonts available from Dan Solo, although he DID digitize some of them, and they
    are of course listed in the Solopedia. If you're not familiar with it, the catalog
    was produced as list of services he offered at his printshop from the mid 1930's
    through the mid 90's, including special effects as well as font selection.\r\n\r\nIn
    no way is the Solopedia an attempt to identify free clones, as you intimate. I
    haven't looked with that in mind, but I'd estimate that 90% of the identified
    digitizations are commercial fonts from such sources as Nicksfonts, Linotype,
    URW, etc.  Where free fonts are known, they are also listed; in some cases they
    are the only known digitization, while in others they may be equivalent or inferior
    to commercial equivalents, and yes, unfortunately, some are known to be clones
    from such sour ces as Opti/Castcraft, WSI, and SouthernSoftware.\r\n\r\n  - Herb."

    call it a revival. That was tempered once I finally met Don Hase and the Friedman
    family and then it became painfully clear to me it wasn't a slapdash job. It initially
    required the talents of folks beyond my capabilities as a typeface designer to
    really bring the work to the level I had intended it be revived as.\r\n\r\nI'm
    very pleased with the result of our efforts thus far and there is plenty of work
    that remains. The open invitation stands and we welcome all inquiries for participation.
    I think the original 40 typefaces was more or less a filter as suggested and it
    is likely a dogmatic mechanism I'll agree to your point Hrant which doesn't truly
    represent the talents of a designer who's worked on perhaps 15 typefaces or less.\r\n\r\nThese
    days, all candidates are discussed by the current members and we decide based
    on the work that they have published, regardless of volume if we feel they'll
    be a good fit. And every current member started out by making an inquiry to me
    which means it's something they shared the vision for the intent of the library
    which is really the most important aspect of the effort."
