  Interpolate Nudge module from Christian Robertson and by the other hand, DialogKit
  from Tal Leming, the result is a very simple tool that for me is very useful. I
  share this with you, maybe it could be useful for someone else... Please, feel free
  to use it! \r\n<code></code>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EMT_interpolate_panel_4536.png]\r\n\r\n<strong>Requeriments</strong>\r\nInterpolate

  body: I never thought the Interpolate Nodes tool was that difficult to use in FL.
    I tried your nudge tool and found it lacking. I guess its just me.

    in FL.</cite>\r\n\r\nme neither ...\r\n\r\n<cite>-I tried your nudge tool and
    found it lacking. I guess its just me.</cite>\r\n\r\nNo problem James, this tool
    works for me, but is not for everyone :)\r\n\r\nI will try to explain how I use
    it (but my English is limited ):\r\n\r\nIf you only do \"one\" movement with the
    node, and a fixed distance, is faster a shortcut* of original Interpolate Nudge
    (for example: Alt + Shift + 6 = NudgeRight10).  \r\n*FL only allow 10 macros shortcuts.\r\n\r\nI
    usually do more than one movement with a node (and with different distances),
    in this case, my little tool is faster: I can change the distance on the moment
    and press the button (in any direction) and change again for fine tuning and so
    on... \r\nI gain more control, and in the last term, velocity in complex movements.\r\n\r\nI
    use a shortcut for quick access to the tool, the focus is in the text field so
    you can change directly the number, you can also change easily the default value(10)
    of script by another...\r\n\r\nI would like that something similar (or better,
    maybe a window that allow change the selected nodes, MM compatible, etc) comes
    built-in in new versions of FL...\r\n\r\nRegards and thanks to all for the comments...\r\n\r\nem.\r\n"

  body: "FLS5's <em>Interpolate Nodes</em> is good for detailed adjustments when a
    couple of nodes should be moved individually. (Unfortunately, there is a nasty
    bug in Mac FLS5 which makes it impossible to do correct numerical adjustments.)
    \r\nBut for many things this is over the top, and I simply want to select a few
    nodes that should stay where they are and then select some other nodes and move
    them simultaneously. This is why I built the <em>Transformer</em> interface around
    FLS5's <em>Interpolate Nodes</em>. \r\n</em>Interpolate Nudge</em> in turn (and
    either the interface version this thread is about or Andreas Eigendorf's Tool
    version) is useful for editing curves which consist of, say, top and bottom extrema,
    with a left or right extremum to be moved, and no intermediate on-curve nodes
    between these extrema.\r\nEach tool serves specific needs (a specific user or
    specific type of curves) and there is no one-fits-all."

  body: Hello Bill. All the tools mentioned above are meant to adjust one (or more)
    curve segment(s) between static points and one (or more) point(s) repositioned
    by the designer -- intermediate (off/on-curve) points are adjusted relative to
    the repositioning of the repositioned point(s). RMX Tools and UFO Stretch in turn
    need at least two masters, and with a combination of interpolation and scaling
    inbetween these, they reduce/enlarge, condense/expand, lighten/bolden entire letters.
