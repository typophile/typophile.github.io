  suggest ITC Avant Garde Gothic Demi and Swiss 721 but they're not quite right. It's
  most noticeable in the characters 'c', 'k' and 's' for Avant Garde. \r\n\r\nThe
  store's website: http://www.cook-book.com\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated.
  Thank you.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/COOKBOOKLOGOCopySm_4022.jpg]"

    cut of Avant Garde is exactly right. At least I can\u2019t detect any differences
    when overlaying your sample with the Avant Garde letters."
