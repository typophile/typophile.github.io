  body: '<i>Therefore a lot of issues are discussed vigorously among type designers,
    typographers and others about missing certain characters or even scripts. Further,
    a somewhat questionable encoding policy on the Unicode side is considered by many
    professionals.</i> <BR> <BR>Can you give some examples of &#39;missing characters&#39;?
    I&#39;ve been involved with Unicode for several years, and most often when people
    start talking about missing characters I find that they do not understand the
    character/glyph distinction. There is also a tendency to base opinions on what
    is missing on what is present, ignoring the fact that there are many characters
    in Unicode that are there only for backwards compatibility with pre-existing character
    sets, and do not meet the character criteria of the Unicode character/glyph model.
    Of course, this does not mean that there are not genuine missing characters, but
    there are procedures for proposing such characters and, if they meet the Unicode
    character criteria, they will be encoded. <BR> <BR>This is not to say that the
    Unicode Standard is perfect: there are things which I think the UTC got wrong,
    some of which can and has been changed, but much of which cannot be changed because
    of stability agreements with other standards bodies. <BR> <BR>I would be interested
    to know what, exactly, &#39;many professionals&#39; find &#39;somewhat questionable&#39;
    about the Unicode encoding policy.'

  body: 'I agree with John&#39;s comments above. I&#39;m particularly curious about
    what &#34;missing scripts&#34; there are? I mean, sure, it seems like they have
    old Nordic runes without having all the old Hungarian runes, but in terms of modern
    language usage, what&#39;s missing? <BR> <BR>As for the encoding policy, there
    are really three policies that govern Unicode: <BR> <BR>1&#41; compatibility with
    pre-existing encoding standards <BR> <BR>2&#41; encode characters, not glyphs
    &#40;except when required by 1 above&#41; <BR> <BR>3&#41; use only one slot for
    a given character, even though it may have somewhat different presentation forms
    in different languages <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious about which of these principles
    people are objecting to, and on what grounds. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll note that the
    existence of principles 2 and 3 strongly implies the need for a technology like
    OpenType to bridge the character/glyph divide, to handle things such as small
    caps, alternate forms, etc. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T'

  body: "At the beginning: I criticize neither the work nor the necessity of unicode.
    <BR>In this call it concerns the exchange and suggestions. Mainly to signographic
    problems with unicode. <BR> <BR>For example: <BR>In the Bulgarian Code Page are
    included all vowels with accents that are really necessary for the typesetting
    in Bulgarian language, and are not included in the Cyrillic Code Page. Different
    Glyphes and same unicode... <BR> <BR>0x0432\t#\tCYRILLIC SMALL LETTER VE <BR>0x0436\t#\tCYRILLIC
    SMALL LETTER ZHE <BR>0x043A\t#\tCYRILLIC SMALL LETTER KA <BR>0x044E\t#\tCYRILLIC
    SMALL LETTER YU <BR> <BR>I very probably understood the differences between a
    character and glyphs.  But if I liked to make an extensive cyrillic, italic OT
    Font, I have problems with Russian and Serbian &#40;0x043F CYRILLIC SMALL TYPE
    CHARACTER PE&#41;. This character has completely different forms with same unicode
    in italics. Why? <BR> <BR>Why codepage for Dingbats &#40;Range: 2700"

  body: The Serbian italics and the typographic glyphs issue are both conqequences
    of the character/glyph model &#40;principles 2 and 3 I outlined above&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Neither of these things is a &#34;problem&#34; in a smart font format such
    as OpenType. For example, all of our Cyrillic fonts support the Serbian forms
    in the italic. <BR> <BR>The general reason for not encoding typographic glyphs
    as if they were characters is that it is harmful to plain text operations, and
    it is an unbounded task. What ligatures would you encode? How about the &#34;Th&#34;
    ligature that is commonly found in newer Adobe text fonts? What about people who
    want to have two sizes of small caps in the same font? Or figures that are halfway
    between oldstyle and lining? <BR> <BR>Finally, the question about which dingbats
    are in Unicode is a question of which ones got in because of association with
    existing standards and codepages. I think you&#39;ll find that the black telephone
    is a standard character in one of the Asian standard character sets, for example.

    <BR> <BR>Missing scripts  -:  I enjoyed to lern recently that there are serious
    activities to add relevant historic or minority scripts. I regard this as very
    important, in the case of historic scripts it becomes possible for us in the future
    to keep in touch with our cultural heritage. Many publishing projects need to
    use things like Etruscan, Anglosaxon, Gaelic, Gothic, Hethit and the like. <BR>  <BR>Missing
    characters  -:  It&#39;s not so strange that there are any characters missed at
    all, but in some cases I cannot avoid wondering about the contents of a certain
    set encoded. An example for this: Currency symbols &#40;20A0 - 20B1. Apart from
    the well known $, '

  body: 'Andreas, <BR> <BR>Missing scripts. New scripts are being added all the time,
    and there is a significant roadmap document that preserves spaces for new scripts
    in both the Basic Multilingual Plane &#40;16 bit&#41; and the extenstion planes
    &#40;32 bit&#41;. Of the scripts you mention, Etruscan and Gothic are already
    encoded. I&#39;m not sure what you mean by Gaelic script. <BR> <BR>Missing characters.
    If you know of a character that you think needs to be encoded, I encourage you
    to document it and submit a proposal. Sometimes, if you make enough noise about
    a particular character and provide a convincing enough argument, someone else
    will do the work of submitting a proposal, but you can&#39;t rely on this. Better
    to do it yourself. Example: last year at ATypI in Rome, Peter Lofting from Apple
    made a pilgrimage to the Isle of Tiberius to photograph the earlist known carving
    of the Rod of Aesclepius in order to demonstrate that this should not be confused
    with the caduceus and should be separately encoded. He documented his proposal
    well, and the Rod of Aesclepius has been accepted for encoding in the Unicode
    Miscellaneous Symbols block. I also notice that the Guarani currency symbol has
    been accepted, which means that someone has done the work of proposing it. <BR>
    <BR>Regarding scribal abbreviations, I am not convinced that these need to be
    encoded. Unicode encodes characters for plain text, but not everything that occurs
    in text needs to occur in plain text. Scribal abbreviations are a form of ligature,
    and it is possible for them to be handled with markup and with smart font features
    &#40;including selection from multiple abbreviations of the same character sequence&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Regarding generic informational signs, there is a move to encode more
    of them, although this has raised the philosophical question of where, exactly,
    does one draw the line. A case in point is the &#39;Man cleaning up after his
    dog&#39; sign, which has recently been debated by members of the UTC &#40;not
    sure what they decided&#41;. Such things will always -- and probably should --
    raise philosophical issues for a <i>text</i> encoding standard. <BR> <BR>Regarding
    Zapf Dingbats, those are included only for backwards compatibility with Apple&#39;s
    ZD codepage. They may not have been accepted if proposed today, but they went
    in very early, and Apple were a founder members of the consortium. The circled
    numbers are for compatibility with East Asian standards. <BR> <BR>Regarding the
    graphic representation of characters in the codepages, these are intended to be
    informational only, and are clearly identified as such. The charts are not claimed
    to be normative, inerrant, consistent, or anything else; the Unicode Standard
    is not the charts, it is the abstract characters behind the charts. The charts
    are made from available fonts, in many cases provided by the individuals who proposed
    specific characters for inclusion. Yes, there is room for improvement, and yes
    it is possible to suggest improvements or, even better, provide replacement fonts.
    The Unicode Consortium is not interested, however, in a &#39;universal standard
    of writing&#39;: the glyphs in the code charts need to be sufficient to present
    a recognisable and acceptable form for each character: <i>any recognisable and
    acceptable form</i>. Unicode is a character encoding standard for plain text:
    it is intended to be the backbone of text processing, not as a project to catalogue
    shapes.'

  body: 'Dear Thomas, John et all, <BR> <BR>it is for me all about the following:
    <BR>By the beginning of 2003 the coding of SmallCaps was regulated by the AdobeGlyphList
    &#40;AGL&#41; obviously. A unicode was for the base glyphs exactly one name and
    exactly scheduled in it. All earlier &#39;expert-fonts&#39; are based on this
    allocation. Since the beginning of 2003 has given the Adobe Glyph List For New
    Fonts &#40;AGLFN&#41;. It is defined into this that SmallCaps is coded completely
    in the PUA. No obligatory unicode. This already was before so but the designer
    has the &#39;total&#39; freedom now. He can allocate the name and unicode both
    freely in PUA. <BR> <BR>Situation following now: A typographer puts a text with
    an extensive use of SmallCaps. The customer doesn&#39;t like the used document.
    The typographer changes it. The new document is coded &#40;by ADLFN&#41; completely
    differently than the old one. Text garbage arises ... <BR> <BR>Foundry A coded
    SmallCaps in PUA. Foundry B coded SmallCaps differend from Foundry A. How can
    there be a passing consistency there if the obligatory creation is missing as
    you code? <BR> <BR>Why can&#39;t a creation be made for SmallCaps &#40;extended
    Latin&#41;, PetitCaps &#40;extended Latin&#41; and Titlings &#40;extended Latin&#41;
    in unicode? Why the &#39;usual&#39; ligatures obligatorily don&#39;t code. With
    stand-by. Sufficient space would be available in the unicode tables anyway. <BR>

  body: '[this message by Andreas St&#246;tzner was generously posted by Ingo Preuss
    because of technical problems with posting] <BR> <BR>Dear John, <BR> <BR>I always
    enjoy to learn things getting better. And I believe, besides some critical querries,
    that the completion of the standard is really on a good way.  <BR> <BR>It would
    actually be no problem &#40;for me&#41; to make one proposal per week, but, as
    a freelancer hunting for jobs to feed a family and spending the rest of time to
    collecting and signographic research it&#39;s a little bit hard to afford even
    further resources to a proposal procedure if it goes beyond some four, five characters.
    I don&#39;t know wether others do think so too. Well, but that&#39; perhaps a
    personal problem rather than Unicode&#39;s. <BR> <BR>You have stated one aspect
    which in particular seems worth considering: that Unicode is a standard for text
    processing and not a catalogue of graphic shapes. Sure, this has to be put a stress
    on. Yet, what is text, and what is not? <BR> <BR>I do ask this for a couple of
    reasons. I guess, at least we being people of the western culture are still sometimes
    preoccupated with the concept of &#39;text&#39; just consisting of &#39;script&#39;
    and &#39;script&#39; consisting of alphabetical characters. But this is obviously
    only a partition of what we have to deal with. '

  body: Regarding the smallcaps mess, this has nothing to do with Unicode, which does
    not encode smallcaps. This has to do with pre-Unicode software and fonts using
    8-bit character sets to include smallcaps and Adobe&#39;s very unfortunate decision
    to map from those smallcap character sets to the Unicode &#60;i&#62;Private Use
    Area&#62;/I&#62;, i.e. to non-standard codepoints. With the result than any document
    produced using these codepoints for smallcaps will be garbage unless displayed
    in appropriate fonts that use Adobe&#39;s convention &#40;a convention that even
    Adobe have realised was a bad idea&#41;. <BR> <BR>Smallcaps should not be encoded
    as such. A smallcap letter is a glyph variant &#40;of either a lowercase or uppercase
    character, depending on context&#41;, and should be handled in markup, i.e. at
    a higher level above plain text. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll respond to your other comments
    later.
