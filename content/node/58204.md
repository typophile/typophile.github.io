  Garde as a typeface. Not necessarily as a primary face, but in any sort of brand
  communication, including campaigns. Adidas have used it before, any other ideas
  would be fantastic...\r\n\r\ncheers!"

    But offhand all I can think of for branding is the <em>Rock Band</em> game series.
    There must be many more, though.
