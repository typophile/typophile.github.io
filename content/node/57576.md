  ffl ligs in addition to the more standard fi and fl.\r\n\r\nWe're working in InDesign
  so if the ligs are there it will use them. I assumed I could purchase the \"Std\"
  OTF versions of the fonts but based on the ones we currently have it doesn't look
  like the standard fonts have those extra ligatures.\r\n\r\nI've looked around on
  the web a bit and even found Microsoft's Opentype standard site, which, I'm guessing
  I could browse for a week and still not find my answer.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  if my statement above is correct and that the \"Std\" fonts do not contain those
  extra ligs and/or is there something here or elsewhere that shows what the difference
  in btween the two?\r\n\r\nMany, many thanks,\r\nKen"

  body: "There is neither a universal standard encoding for fonts nor agreed upon
    naming convention. Each designer/foundry puts in whatever glyphs they feel like,
    then call the font whatever they think sound good. However, there are usually
    standards within each foundry, so once you figure out what that is you can have
    a better idea of what each font should contain.\r\n\r\nBut to almost answer your
    question, generally STD OTF fonts are direct conversions of old Type 1 or TT fonts
    into OpenType, but without anything extra. Extra ligatures were not normally in
    those fonts, so they are not often in STD OTF. Pro fonts vary considerably more,
    and would be more likely to have more ligatures, wider language support, and some
    cooler features.\r\n\r\nYou just need to check with the foundry and check the
    character set of the font you are interested in to know what you are getting."
