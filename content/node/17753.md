  I am kind of making things up as I go along by examination and copying, and published
  specs for OFA implementations such as TrueType and OpenType.\r\nI have two questions
  that remain though:\r\n\r\n1) Do tables have to be aligned on four byte word boundaries?\r\n2)
  Is there any reason why tables are output in a specific order, yet given in a different
  order in the table listing at the start of the file? e.g. in the Apple Symbols font
  the header gives the tables in this order: LTSH, OS/2, VDMX, cmap, ... but by offset
  in the file the tables are ordered hmtx, fpgm, prep, loca, glyf, ...\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any insight,\r\n\u2013 Nicholas"

  body: "You may want to look at Recommendaations for OpenType fonts(<a>http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm</a>).\r\n\r\nThere
    is no strict requirement on table alignment and ordering in the OpenType format.
    However it is recommended to have them 4-byte aligned and padded with zeroes to
    4-byte boundary. Form the page above:\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nTable Alignment and Length\r\n\r\nAll
    tables should be aligned to begin at offsets which are multiples of four bytes.
    While this is not required by the TrueType rasterizer, it does prevent ambiguous
    checksum calculations and greatly speeds table access on some processors. \r\n\r\nAll
    tables should be recorded in the table directory with their actual length. To
    ensure that checksums are calculated correctly, it is suggested that tables begin
    on LONG word boundries. Any extra space after a table (and before the next LONG
    word boundry) should be padded with zeros. \r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nPhysical order of
    tables in the font does not depend at all on alphabetical order of tables in the
    font header. Table ordering recommendations are based on the order in which operating
    system typically read font data. Grouping some tables together really does (or
    at least did) significantly speed up font loading time. Recommended order is (from
    the same page):\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nOptimized Table Ordering\r\n\r\nOpenType fonts
    with TrueType outlines are more efficient in the Windows operating system when
    the tables are ordered as follows (from first to last):\r\n\r\nhead, hhea, maxp,
    OS/2, hmtx, LTSH, VDMX, hdmx, cmap, fpgm, prep, cvt, loca, glyf, kern, name, post,
    gasp, PCLT, DSIG\r\n\r\nThe initial loading of an OpenType font containing CFF
    data will be more efficiently handled if the following sfnt table ordering is
    used within the body of the sfnt (listed from first to last):\r\n\r\nhead, hhea,
    maxp, OS/2, name, cmap, post, CFF, (other tables, as convenient)\r\n\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nHope
    this will help.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey\r\n"
