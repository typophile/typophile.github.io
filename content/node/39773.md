  body: "My guess: these are handcrafted glyphs, probably a sports clubs intitials,
    3-d, placed on the edge of a roof or on the top of a door..\r\nThe maker mistakingly
    used a Z for the S, but thought no one would notice it if reversed.\r\n(All guessing
    done without elaborate enhancement).\r\n\r\n . . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

    it is hand drawn.\r\nSo I have to use a similar font."
