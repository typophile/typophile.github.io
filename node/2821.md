  body: I don&#39;t know, though it looks like a blackletter over Frutiger or something.
    If it&#39;s a typeface &#40;and not a clever design, cool all the same&#41; I&#39;d
    like to hear its story.

  body: Looks to me like a synthesis of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/bold/testdrive.html?s=OneToughMother&amp;p=48">Helvetica</a>
    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/fette-gotisch/gotisch-ef-bold/testdrive.html?s=OneToughMother&amp;p=48">Fette
    Gotisch</a>. Very cleverly done.

  body: It&#39;s a good idea...I&#39;m not entirely sure it was as well executed as
    it might have been. <BR> <BR>I think for titling I&#39;d have created a &#34;Mo&#34;
    ligature, more like &#34;To&#34;. <BR> <BR>I work a lot with sign making software,
    and I&#39;m used to the odd lumps and bumps that get created when you combine
    or weld shapes together. Sometimes they may be geometrically correct, but visually,
    they&#39;ve often gotta go. Like the small &#34;blip&#34; top left on the &#34;g&#34;
    and the small white space mid left on the &#34;M&#34;. <BR> <BR>Like I said, I
    like the idea, I just think it would have benefited from a bit more polish. <BR>

    Giasson&#39;s sadly missed <a href="http://typographi.ca/000629.php" target="_blank">

  body: Great feedback. I think the original post/pict is a hand job, with a Helvetica
    and Fette Gotisch overlay. Great pick up on that Mark, it hadn&#39;t crossed my
    mind.  <BR> <BR>Thanks Yves for the Royal Family Scan! At least it gives me an
    idea for the direction I want to go in...Superb input, thanks everyone.  <BR>
    <BR>No love from Mike Y?

    from me. ;-&#41; I&#39;ve been gone the past few days, and am just catching up
    anyway.
