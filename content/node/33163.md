body: Bit of a weird one. From the film Awakenings with Robin Williams. The font that
  is displayed on the scales that the nurse uses to measure medicine, it's really
  nice, but I don't have a sample!

    this scene flashed past. I just for a second seen the mg and thought it looked
    quite nice. I still do like the 'g'. What's your view? Any idea what it is?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for this.\r\n\r\nR."
