body: "Hello all.\r\n\r\nHere is a design by Mucca and I'm aware that they do a lot
  of their own type design. I'm hoping it isn't the case for this design because I
  could use this font/style for a project that requires a \"Frenchy, not entirely
  art nouveau, storefront sign\" font. \r\n\r\nAny ID or other suggestions would be
  most helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nRTT\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It probably is custom work, but <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/schiller-antiqua-rr/\">Schiller
    Antiqua</a> is somewhat similar in the heavier weights. The T would need the most
    tweaking, but you could approximate this with layering.\r\n\r\nI'm still looking
    for something closer. Perhaps at Letterhead Fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
