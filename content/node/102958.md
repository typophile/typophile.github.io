body: I'm looking for the attached "military stencil" type font. Naturally, I'd love
  to find this one, but I suspect there is a fair chance it is a single custom job.
  I've looked through several pages, but the "R" style seems pretty unique. Thanks
  again.

  body: Fair point. They may very well have just taken Bank Gothic and modified it
    from there.
