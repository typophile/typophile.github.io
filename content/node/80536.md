  I'm having a bit of difficulty attempting to align elliptical shapes to each-other
  in specific ways. \r\n\r\nIf you look at the attached image (a simple hypothetical
  example), all I'm trying to do is position the darker blue circles within the larger
  lighter blue circle such that the intersecting edges of each ellipse align *absolutely
  and exactly* on top of each-other. \r\n\r\nThe intersections I am talking about
  are highlighted via the red ellipses. \r\n\r\nI cannot for the life of me finagle
  Illustrator to accomplish this deceptively complex task and I've just resorted to
  approximation.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any idea? It would be a huge help as I've spent
  hours tonight trying to figure out how to reliably do this. :(\r\n\r\n"

    with mixed success, but I don't know if Illustrator offers this option.

  body: "There is no aligment tool to achieve this in Illustrator. The <em>Snap to
    object</em> available in CorelDraw is an old lacking feature in IL. And more I
    work with FontLab, less I like Illustrator.\r\n\r\nBut these techniques can help:\r\n\r\n<strong>1.</strong>\r\nSimply
    use Outline view (Ctrl+Y), increase the zoom and do manual alignment. Although
    manual, it is absolutely precise when you work at maximum zoom. This would be
    my first choice.\r\n\r\n<strong>2.</strong>\r\nIf you know where you want each
    ellipse to touch the other, you can use <em>Snap to point</em>.\r\n\r\nEnable
    this option under View menu. With pen tool, create nodes where you want ellipses
    to be aligned. Drag and drop one ellipse to another positioning you mouse over
    the created nodes. When close enough, ellipses will snap.\r\n\r\nYou can let this
    a bit easier increasing the Snap to point option in Preferences > Selection and
    set Snap to point to 8 (the max value).\r\n\r\nThis procedure may be not the more
    quick to your need, but to handle it can be useful in a number of situations.\r\n"

  body: 'Addition: in IL CS4 and CS5 you can Ctrl+drag objects from their points to
    make them snap. Unhappily the snap criteria is still the point, not the object,
    thus you must create additional points prior to dragging.'
