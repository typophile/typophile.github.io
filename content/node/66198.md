body: "I'm surprised no-one has asked this before on Typophile (my search at least
  yielded no results). When generating fonts in FontLab I often get the message:\r\n\r\n<code>[WARNING]
  The feature file OS/2 overrides TypoAscender and TypoDescender do not sum to the
  font bbox size!</code>\r\n\r\nI assume this has to do with the metrics settings
  somehow, but no matter how I play around with the metrics this message won't go
  away.\r\n\r\nO ye wise, what is wrong, how did I cause it, and how do I make it
  go away?"

  body: The referenced thread notwithstanding, in my experience the message goes away
    if, on the "Most important font dimensions" page, simply make the Ascender and
    the Descender AS A POSITIVE value equal the UPM (e.g., 750+250=1,000), then check
    the "Copy values to TrueType metrics" box, then hit "Apply." Don't ask me why,
    but it works every time.
