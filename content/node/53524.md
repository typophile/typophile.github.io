    Varigraph is a device, named after a company by the same name, which allows letterforms
    to be traced in an altered style or special effect (such as backslanted, obliqued,
    italic, expanded, vertically stretched, etc.). The device is placed on a blank
    page, and a pen, connected to a tracing tool through mechanical linkages, marks
    the altered letterform outlines on the paper. "
