  body: Curious, I read an article recently about Carson/RayGun <BR>and it said that
    he &#40;Carson&#41; started Garagefonts. <BR> <BR>I thought Garagefonts was under
    the Phil&#39;s Fonts umbrella... <BR> <BR>So was Carson ever the owner?  <BR>
    <BR>Tamye...?

  body: Hamilton Offset was designed by Bill Moran of <a href="http://www.blincpublishing.com/">Blinc
    Publishing</a>. This face was shown at TypeCon this past summer. Bill gave a very
    cool presentation &#40;in a very hot room&#41; at the Minnesota Center for Book
    Arts.

  body: David Carson did indeed start GarageFonts circa 1993, with his former intern/employee/something-like-that,
    graphic designer Betsy Kopshina. Betsy&#39;s husband, Norbert Schulz, became involved
    at some point, not sure if was at the very beginning or a bit later. <BR> <BR>GF
    was founded primarily as a vehicle to distribute the typefaces &#40;mostly&#41;
    other designers created for use in RayGun mag. Carson was no longer involved in
    GF after a couple of years, and Betsy and Norbert continued to run the foundry.
    <BR> <BR>They decided to sell GFin the late 90s and concentrate on Betsy&#39;s
    busy design concern &#40;<a href="http://www.adesigngarden.com" target="_blank">www.adesigngarden.com</a>&#41;
    and Norbert&#39;s own efforts. <BR> <BR>Ralph Smith from Phil&#39;s Fonts took
    it over at that point, and started releasing new fonts from a slew of international
    designers. Now GF is happy and thriving with the folks at Phil&#39;s, still under
    its own indie label. <BR> <BR>Some of the old RayGun types are still available
    at GarageFonts... <a href="http://www.garagefonts.com" target="_blank">www.garagefonts.com</a>
