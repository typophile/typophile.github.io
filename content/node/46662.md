  about a sport/transportation product mainly used in northern regions like Scandinavia.\r\nI
  decided to use Whitney light as my text font but looking for a fontstyle for the
  titles which is both matching to the text style as well as picing up the sport,
  fresh, adventurous character.\r\n.. But nevertheless, probably the text font is
  not the best one as well.\r\nBtw. the paragraphs are quite short, it only takes
  a minute to read it through.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThx a lot!!\r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\nSepp"

title: Whitney as text font, but what about the title?
