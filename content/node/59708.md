  a question(s).\r\n\r\nFirst, if a type designer were giving recommendations for
  Justification of a particular font, do you all think that recommendation should
  be a binary decision, (i.e. Y/N)?\r\n\r\nSecond, if a type designer were giving
  recommendations for Hyphenation of a particular font, do you all think that recommendation
  should be a binary decision, (i.e. Y/N)?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any input.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Justification without hyphenation on the Web tends to look pretty bad, so
    I would discourage it. As to the second question, I guess it depends on how the
    typeface stands fiddling with its spacing. But being that there\u2019s no hyphenation
    on the Web \u2013 yet! \u2013 it\u2019s another N for me."

  body: "On the one hand, I would say that neither recommendation should be binary
    Y/N because you can't anticipate all the factors (different browsers, different
    H&J algorithms (or lack thereof), future-proofing, backwards compatibility, text
    size, etc.) that would influence the recommendation. On the other hand, I'd say
    that the recommendation has to be binary Y/N because you can't anticipate all
    the factors....\r\n\r\nPut it another way: the recommendation shouldn't have to
    be binary, but I don't see how you could make the recommendation more nuanced
    given that you can't know for certain what the reader will be seeing."

  body: "So, if a Yes can have conditions, then we'd want justification's Yes to be
    dependent on the ability to say Yes to hyphenation too. \r\n\r\nJohn, I'm thinking
    more along the lines of recommendations that are not dependent on 'all the factors'
    but focus more on the font's design factors alone, e.g. Monospaced fonts, seriously
    contextualized designs, or connecting scripts where all the Justification answers
    are stark. \r\n\r\nAnd then, I'm also thinking of dedicated headline fonts, where
    H & J answers are also both fairly stark...\r\n\r\nDoes that make more sense?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
