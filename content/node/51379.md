    for a class project.

  body: "I can't place it right away but someone here will certainly know. I'm definitely
    curious now so I'll go check it out. For some reason, my usually undependable
    memory tells me Font Bureau is/was responsible for some Playboy fonts. I'll go
    turn over some rocks now as a matter of fact. \r\n\r\nAt this very moment, however,
    all I can tell you for sure is I definitely went to all the wrong schools."

  body: I thought it might be <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_bailey_sans_std_virtual/?sample_text=WALTER%20MOSLEY&sample_size=48">ITC
    Bailey</a>, but it's only a close alternative, not a match. And I must say I find
    it very difficult to concentrate on the type. :^/

    close now. Good eye.

  body: There you go Jeremiah. Not sure if I ever would've found that one, and I did
    do a pretty decent-sized search. My own personal explosion only took place three
    or four years ago, which limits my abilities of type identification. However as
    you can see, this forum is over-flowing with knowledge, especially on the subject
    of identification.

  body: "Well, Christopher, I think each one here is more focused on certain aspects,
    or periods.\r\nPersonally, I'd be a disaster in identifying non-digital type,
    especially designs which have not been international or which are not part of
    my heritage (i.e. Italian types).\r\nBut as long as it cames to the worldwide
    \"post-modern\" wave in digital design (the one which preceeded the new generation
    of younger, more conscious and learned type designers), I was fixed on those Latin
    letters transmutations almost continuously up to, more or less, seven years ago.\r\nBut
    although I can tell the names of even the most obscure faces from CalArts students,
    or used by David Carson, I'd have serious problems in identifying many faces of
    the more recent years\u2026\r\n\r\nJeremiah? At least allow me some Isaiah\u2026
