  body: "Thanks, Joshua! It took a while to make the extrude layer. Fontlab's 3D extrude
    effect leaves little corners and awkward looking dints on round bits, so I had
    to do every glyph by hand:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/D_6656.png]"

  body: Congrats and good luck Dave. These look great. I do have to say I'm a little
    uncomfortable with the name Alight Slab, since there's already a well established
    Alright Sans on the market...

  body: I did consider the possible confusion, but consoled myself with the fact that
    even though it's only one letter different, it is a completely different word.
    There's also another font just called 'Alright' which was released before Alright
    Sans, so if we get too nitpicky with naming we'll run out of them a lot faster!
    I checked that spelling mistakes on the MyFonts search wouldn't point the wrong
    way. Alight Sans as a search doesn't get to mine or Okay Type's fonts, and Alright
    Slab doesn't find any either, so if Jackson was to make Alright Slab, there shouldn't
    be any problems with confusion.

    the designs aren't much alike. It's hard enough to find a good name!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
