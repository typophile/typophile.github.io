  body: "I'm not a vegetarian so my reaction probably isn't what you intended, but
    here are a few suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe lighting is too flat. Normally food photography
    is done with a much softer light, and is angled to create highlights and shadows
    for a 3D look. Perhaps you feel a harsher look is more appropriate, but I would
    experiment to see if the lighting can be improved. Also the lighting doesn't seem
    totally consistent from letter to letter.\r\n\r\nAlso consider adding a slight
    shadow on the page to make them look more like 3D objects rather than cutouts.
    Some blood might help; maybe photograph it on a slight angle so the blood is running
    down the page. And maybe add a bloody knife."

  body: "So you're going to convince meat-eaters to go vegetarian by showing them
    things they consider desirable? My own only quandary looking at that stuff is
    what order I should devour them in!\r\n\r\nYou're being timid to the point of
    back-firing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Maybe use meats that are less popular? Organ meats, hoofs, intestines, ears,
    etc. (you'd probably have to get some of those at a butcher shop, not a grocery
    store). \r\n\r\nBut since many folks (at least in the U.S.) don't eat those parts
    anyway, maybe it wouldn't resonate. "

  body: "Can you give us a bit more info on what you're trying to achieve helyestica?\r\n\r\nWhat
    you've created is interesting from a conceptual perspective but does it 'meat'
    the brief?"
