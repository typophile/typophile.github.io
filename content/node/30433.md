  bilingual booklet. This has already gone to print, and the event is long over, but
  I would like to get your thoughts before it's time to work on the next convocation
  booklet.\r\n\r\nI've attached a pdf with some of the pages.\r\n\r\nEdit: I haven't
  included the cover because I didn't design it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKristina\r\n\r\nEdit
  #2. Thanks for the input. I'm removing the file because I'm not sure it would be
  cool with the people listed in the booklet to keep it posted.\r\n\r\nThx"

  body: It looks clean, however I wouldn't <em>really</em> like reading such large
    portions of text in italics. Maybe you can use a Regular and Light version of
    a different typeface the next time? One weight for one language, and the other
    weight for the other.

  body: "I would go with differentiation through colour rather than weight.\r\n\r\nHere
    in Ireland, most governmental publications are required to be produced bilingually
    (even more-so now given Gaeilge\u2019s recent acceptance as an official European
    language) and thus this design issue often arises. Officially the requirement
    is that there be no importance given to the English over Gaeilge and vice versa.
    Colour differentiation is the natural solution.\r\n\r\nPersonally I feel it looks
    and reads better."

  body: "I find the use of small caps at the beginning of every paragraph of the introductory
    copy a little too much, especially combined with an indent, I think I would use
    it for the first paragraph of each section but not in the subsequent paragraphs.
    \r\n\r\nIt also seems odd that the actual degrees don't have a french translation,
    and when the titles of papers are already in italics I don't think the indent
    on the second line is necessary, the italic is already indicating a section; I
    might be inclined to lose the space after the titles of the degree discipline
    and the indent for following text; and use an abbreviation and key to indicate
    which students had received distinction rather than having it run over to the
    next line, where it can seem to act as a subtitle. On the headings that you have
    ranged left or right depending on whether they are recto or verso it might be
    nice to use the hedera in a mirror version to continue that. On page 3 I would
    turn over the last word of the penultimate line so that Montreal wouldn't be so
    lonely there are a few more that I would turnover, this is the most in need. The
    rule above the pagination is too similar to the rule used with headings it might
    be better to reduce it in width or run it either side of the numbers with a break
    in between.\r\n\r\nIf you develop a separate style for the actual degrees, this
    could be a different grid or family of fonts, you might be able to keep the french
    in the roman type rather than italic and use recto and verso to differentiate
    between them.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Thanks for the comments.\r\nCertainly a lot of food for thought for next
    time round, and now is the time to make these corrections and decisions, not while
    in the throes of production. :)\r\n\r\n(feeling the need to defend myself, but
    I'll try not to)\r\n\r\nWe discussed using abbreviations and using * or ** to
    indicate with distinction/great distinction, but most of the group preferred to
    include the whole mention, although certainly it would have made my life easier
    to not have it written out in full.\r\n\r\nI guess I need to pay more attention
    to turning over the last words... it's amazaing how you can have gone over something
    so many times and still not notice stuff.\r\n\r\nTim, I'm not sure what you mean
    by:\r\n \r\n>> If you develop a separate style for the actual degrees, this could
    be a different grid or family of fonts, you might be able to keep the french in
    the roman type rather than italic and use recto and verso to differentiate between
    them.\r\n\r\nDo you mean the titles of the degrees? or the listing of names? Everything
    within the listing of names is unilingual English.\r\n\r\nI think I may look at
    choosing a different font for the French next time. I knew that longer amounts
    of text in italics would be more difficult to read, but the weight differences
    in minion don't really make it possible to use light and regular, and I was finding
    it difficult to find an appropriate complementary font. Also, the italics reduced
    the French text, and we were told these front texts would be shorter than they
    ended up being. I do have everything in styles, so changing from one to another
    shouldn't be too bad, and as I said, now's the time.\r\n\r\nThe idea of using
    colour is an interesting one, although, again, problematic. We looked at some
    other convocation booklets which used navy ink throughout on cream-coloured paper.
    It worked very well. However, Concordia's colour is burgundy. Pantone 207 or 209
    depending on the work. The group was worried that using the burgundy would be
    tough to read, and would look too pink. It actually turned out quite nice, and
    darkened by the off-white paper. If we have the budget to continue with the 2-color
    inside, I may be able to convince them to go with French in 209. But we were already
    pushing the budget limits this time round, and next ceremony we have 5 books instead
    of 2. *sigh*   \r\n\r\nWe won't translate the degree names, although we did discuss
    the possibility with the translation department, bt it simply becomes too tedious
    and long. Either the headers and subheaders take up too much space and are too
    repetetive or we have to duplicate the listing of names which becomes, aside from
    long, problematic for accuracy. The book already runs 44 pages. \r\n\r\nUnless
    specifically requested, our degrees are issued in English, so we figured it is
    not a large departure to list them in English only. The disciplines also -- again
    we discussed the possibility of translating and ran into problems: do we translate
    \"etudes francaises\" (which is the program title) into English if we translate
    the others into French? The fact is, it is an English university. Mmm, and we
    also looked at other universities offering bilingual convocation booklets. McGill
    doesn't translate, so we decided to follow them. \r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions
    about the small caps and indents. I will play around. I really didn't know how
    to go about it there. Also the rule above the pagination. Good idea, I will try
    it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks again! It always helps to have specific comments by people
    who know what they're doing. I'm still very new at this, and just learning.\r\n\r\nK."

    way, you could divide the french and english sections in the bilingual sections
    by keeping to the same style as the English (all roman) and establish the left
    page as the default for french readers and right for the english readers. It boils
    down to an alternative to using colour, although a deeper burgundy printed in
    a spot colour should be perfectly readable.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think you need
    to defend yourself, there are good reasons for some of the editorial decisions,
    which we are not privy to, which make sense after you explain them. And, after
    all, these are only suggestions. Turnovers and such are sometimes better spotted
    away from a computer screen, the interface, guides and so on are distracting,
    from a laser print, or by a colleague. I think that there are opportunities to
    save space, for example, on page 24, removing the space after the sub-heads might
    allow you to pull all of Communication Studies back onto one page. btw on page
    26 you have an extra space after Classics. \r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Hm, OK I think I understand. I was worried that where the texts run 2 pages,
    readers would get confused -- you know start reading left and continue right unless
    there was some cue that the right was the same, only English. Hopefully, though,
    the front matter will be a lot shorter next time around, and won't run 2 pages
    for any single item. It bothers me that the main action -- the grad names -- only
    starts half way into the book.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing out that extra space.
    :) It is, indeed, difficult to catch it all. It gets so you can't see straight
    anymore. A fresh pair of eyes is always good.\r\n\r\nWe may be able to go with
    the 209. Do you think the colour will make it more or less important than the
    black? I would be inclined to use colour for the French, but that might be seen
    as giving it more importance. It's a touchy issue here, sometimes.\r\n\r\nLots
    to play with for next time 'round. Thank you! I do appreciate the suggestions.

    I am hesitant to post for critique because I am aware that many of the faux-pas
    I make arise from simple ignorance and inexperience. I am learning on the job
    and have never studied design. I'm doing what I can: reading typophile, typography
    books, and other forums and sites. But I have been scared off by some comments
    on other forums (not here!) that berate newbs like myself for trying to do this
    kind of work without having first studied design.  \r\n\r\nI find most everyone
    here gentle and receptive and super helpful, but I am still worried that someone
    will come along one day and launch the kind of criticism I have read elsewhere.
    And of course, it's easier to post for critique when you are confident about what
    you're doing.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I don't know anyone personally who can
    offer me constructive feedback on what I've produced. I work in something of a
    professional vacuum. So you guys are it. I hope you keep putting up with my tentative
    steps, and that I keep making them :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, the booklet was well received.
    That is to say there was deafening silence and no negative comments. That's as
    good as it gets around here! I hear tell the president's wife is a translator
    -- the translation department was particularly nervous about this project. Thankfully
    my couple of French oversights went unnoticed. So far. ;)\r\n\r\nK."
