body: "hello,\r\n\r\ni am after a modernish sans that would sit well as a body type
  in connection with Lubalin Graph. The bold weight was the basis for the company's
  logo and a medium weight is used for department names below. \r\n\r\nI appreciate
  any suggestions,\r\n\r\nseb"

  body: Lubalin Graph is a serif version of Avant Garde--you could use that. Now that
    I think about it, I can't recall them being used together, though.

      other.\r\n\r\nOr anything else with a very round, geometric design."

    body: Herb Lubalin - when I was a lad - but then _ http://www.graphic-design.com/Type/Avant/Avant2.html
      says it all. They are not used together because they would very rarely work
      together. Use a cursive/italic/anything else to make it happen.

  body: As Mark suggests, the natural compliment to Lubalin Graph would be a geometric
    font with a giant x-height, but that doesn't suit body copy so well. Consider

    of these two was quite common a couple of years ago in UK magazine design, e.g.
    Graphik magazine

  body: Yeah, Lubalin Graph, while not <em>ideal</em> for long copy, is better than
    Avant Garde at that size.

  body: 'FWIW, I don''t think it''s the large x-height that makes AG and LG harder
    to read, it''s the monotonous geometry. The other problem is the high contrast
    between the size of the counters to the size of the sidebearings. LG fares a bit
    better because the serifs push the characters apart some. '

  body: "Thanks for all your info & suggestions. Wasn't aware of the relationship
    between AG & LG - very interesting. So, I toyed a little with AG as a body type
    and it is not exactly pleasing... hmm. Guess, i have to experiment some more.
    Btw, Chris thanks for your AG link - nice article. \r\n\r\nIf there are any more
    suggestions please keep them coming!\r\n\r\n/seb"

    working well with another they say \"compliment\", when it should be \"complement\".\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIt's
    a tall order to ask any face, especially a sans serif, to work as text with medium
    and bold weights of LG, without being overpowered. Perhaps Antique Olive or Eras."
