  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've never run into this before so I thought I would ask the experts. I want to purchase a font but I have two font houses that I can select from for the same font package. I know the reasoning behind why there are two but don't know if one font house (in my case adobe or berthold) is better than the other. Is there any difference in the quality of the type? What types of things do I need to take into consideration when given choices of font houses? Any input would be greatly appreciated.  <BR> <BR>Note: I'm looking to purchase at Philsfonts which has been highly recommended to me, but have never purchased there before.</div>

For 20 years he's  <BR>made a name for himself as an accomplished acoustic  <BR>and electric guitar player. He's also the inventor of  <BR>the Daxophon <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=FF010269X1P1&amp;start=1" target="_blank"> (sic)</a>, an instrument where thin strips  <BR>of wood are played with a bow to mimic animal sounds  <BR>and human voices.&quot; <BR>Reichel redesigned and expanded his popular Barmeno  <BR>family for FontFont, but had to change the name to  <BR>FF Sari to avoid being sued by the new owners of the  <BR>Berthold Type library. See <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html" target="_blank"> aforementionned article</a>: <BR><i>Berthold made FontShop change the name of two of  <BR>their packages (FF New Barmen 1 and 2, now called  <BR>FF Sari 1 and 2), which evidently must have cost  <BR>Fontshop some money and embarrassement. The name  <BR>change was because FF New Barmen was too close to  <BR>Barmeno, which is a Berthold font. As Apostrophe  <BR>puts it: &quot;I can only imagine the stream of curses  <BR>that went through Hans Reichel's head when he was  <BR>told of what happened.</i> <BR> <BR>Which in short means he doesn't own his creation anymore.  <BR>Same thing happened to Albert Boton who <i>can't use  <BR>his own name</i> to brand his type designs anymore  <BR>because one of his typefaces in the Berthold type  <BR>library is called Boton.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree hhp. I started doing design work when Apple IIe ruled and Bitstream was the only font house. I still have the original ps fonts from them. Please no dinosaur jokes! <BR> <BR>So, Yves, you wrote about going to the source. Should I then be looking at FF Sari or stick with Barmeno? I had found a font example that gave enough character yet elegant simplicity for a logo I need to design. Michael Yanega (bowfinprints.com) was kind enough to identify it for me and put me on to this site. I started searching for Barmeno and found out about the Berthold &quot;scandal&quot; and also about the original type designer. <BR> <BR>The font doesn't have to be perfect (it's going on tractors and excavating equipment), but I'm such a type-aholic that when I buy a font I want to get the best one out there at the best price I can afford. Notice I did not say cheap, low cost always helps&hellip;but quality is always first with me. And thanks for spending the time to explain all this.  <BR> <BR>So given all the controversy is there another font I should be looking at that would have a similar character? Or should I go over to FF? <BR> <BR>BTW, bored&ndash;absolutely not. I wish I had time to learn a lot more about the fine details of type. I found all the articles very informative and enlightening. It would have been great to have these kind of places to go to when I was first starting out. I've learned more in the last week about type than I have in the past 5 years. Thanks all!</div>
