  body: The type in the photo appears to be iron-on lettering from a craft store.
    Hobby Lobby sells an almost identical version although they didn't show it in
    white. It may have originated as a font or may not have. It has some unusual characteristics
    of certain letters which don't match any blackletter font in Fraktur mon Amour,
    a comprehensive specimen book of blackletter and similar designs.

    me: why not contact the photographer and ask him? He will probably tell you because
    he really doesn't have a good reason not to."
