    <BR>What do you mean? If you are pointing out that many people who considered
    themselves Christians joined the Nazi party and supported Hitler, obviously this
    is terribly true. If you are pointing to the contribution of 19 centuries of Christian
    antisemitism in European culture to the making the Holocaust possible, you will
    get no argument from me. However, if you are suggesting that the tenets of Christian
    belief and Nazi ideology are the same, then obviously this is not true. They are,
    at least, different, and most people would agree that they are plainly incompatible:
    you need to grossly distort one to arrive at the other. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;m
    increasingly of the opinion that the term &#39;Christian&#39; is close to meaningless
    today, and probably has been since long before even the rise of protestantism.
    There is no religion called Christianity, and the most that can be said is that
    the term recognises the central position of the figure of Christ in a great number
    of different religions that do not agree on who or what Christ was.'

    more objective than some of your sources...&#41; showed that there was greater
    support for Israel&#39;s &#34;policy&#34; towards the Palestinians than there
    is within Israel itself! Not even counting its 10% Arab population. What does
    that tell you? Or at least us, who are not encumbered by a legacy coping mechanism...
    <BR> <BR>You can pretend to be compassionate &#40;or even merely pragmatic&#41;
    as much as you want, but the fact on the ground is that the US &#40;in its broader
    political presence of the House and Senate, even more than the White House&#41;
    unwaveringly supports apartheid measures such as the limiting of marriages and
    the construction of artificial concrete borders&#42;. Only the people already
    brainwashed are fooled. Claiming that popular opinion guides foreign &#40;or even
    domestic&#41; policy is part of the deception. So is the use of &#34;Democracy&#34;
    like a blunt weapon. But this two-faced approach will get you in the end. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>I would probably agree with you that, if the term Christian were to be

    idea that a religion is a set of beliefs reflects, in my opinion, a distinctly
    individualist, protestant interpretation: what a friend of mine -- herself a protestant
    -- calls &#39;head religion&#39;. It ultimately leads people to think they can
    be religious without actually doing anything. Catholicism is emphatically a set
    of beliefs <i>and a set of actions,</i> both individual and communal, and this
    is also the impression I have of Judaism. There are things one should believe
    and there are things that one should do, and together they define the way one
    should live.'

    to discriminate as to what is said or expressed in or via the services that they
    offer. Freedom of speech means that you won&#39;t be arrested, fined, thrown into
    jail, executed, etc. <i>by the state</i> for saying things, and this is the basis
    on which it must be judged. It is fair and accurate to observe that some states
    that affect to guarantee freedom of speech also impose limits on that freedom,
    but it is neither fair nor accurate to present, as an example of the restriction
    of freedom of belief, the decision of a company like eBay exercising its rights
    to define the ways in which its services may be used.

  body: 'Gerald, there are two things to take into account when comparing different
    democratic states: one is the mechanism of democracy employed and the other is
    the political culture of the society. Neither of these things can be considered
    in isolation, either from each other or from other factors, including external
    factors, but together they provide a basic understanding of the differences between,
    say, Canada and Finland. Only some of these differences can be understood in terms
    of different democratic mechanisms &#40;e.g. first-past-the-post vs. proportional
    representation&#41;; in order to &#39;accumulate an unimaginable variation of
    different ideals&#39; you need a political culture that encourages such diversity
    as well as the mechanism to give voice to it. It also helps to be a relatively
    small country in which ideas are a greater factor in everyday political discourse
    than geography and regionalism. <BR> <BR>Bearing these two things &#40;democratic
    mechanisms and political culture&#41; in mind, let me answer your question: <i>Is
    Israel a democracy John?</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, Israel is a democracy, and in purely
    mechanical terms, it is much more like Finland than like Canada. Indeed, one can
    easily argue that proportional representation, which in the Finnish political
    culture reflects a diversity of ideals, is one of the factors contributing to
    what you object to about Israeli government policy. For example, extremist settler
    groups can find a voice in parliament as a result of proportional representation,
    and can influence voting blocks on issues affecting the occupied territories.
    At the same time, Israel manages its own &#39;unimaginable variation of different
    ideals&#39; -- especially unimaginable to those who see Israel only in terms of
    the Palestinian conflict --, including a very significant peace movement and a
    democratic judiciary that has been effectively utilised by human rights organisations
    representing Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories. Considering
    the particular political culture -- and the external factors that contribute to
    it -- that resulted in the election of Ariel Sharon, you might pause to consider
    what kind of country Finland would be if it had spent the past 50 years in near-continuous
    conflict with belligerent neighbours.'

    the report of <i>Palestinian</i> doctors in Jenin that the massacre never took

    wanted to practice genocide, this whole conflict would be over in a matter of
    minutes. Instead, Israel puts its soldiers at risk conducting infantry searches

    of Israel -- not to peace, not to human rights, not to a separate Palestinian
    state: &#39;Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate

    entire towns with missiles without any risk to its own soldiers. As I&#39;ve said
    in the past, much of Israel&#39;s actions in the occupied territories are immoral
    and illegal -- including the crime of turning off the water supply to Jenin during
    the incursion --, but calling it &#39;genocide&#39; is unsupportable by the evidence

  body: <i>...your own recursive propaganda juggernaut.</i> <BR> <BR>Having read plenty
    of pro-Israeli media that overlooks even the most grievous atrocities committed
    by the IDF, I have no argument that propaganda -- in the sense of unapologetically
    biased reporting -- exists and is a real barrier to understanding the situation
    in the Middle East. But the majority of propaganda I see favours the Palestinian
    cause and regularly misrepresents both Israel and the Palestinian militant organisations.
    This is true of much of the reports from Reuters, Associated Press, BBC and other
    wire services and frequently cited news sources. Reuters, for example, regularly
    refers to Hamas as an organisation &#39;fighting for a Palestinian state&#39;,
    while failing to report that this &#40;Islamic theocratic, non-democratic&#41;
    state is intended to occupy the entire territory of Israel. <i>This</i> propaganda
    juggernaut has completely distorted the history of the Arab Israeli conflict,
    and it has been swallowed whole by a depressingly large number of presumably well-meaning,
    liberal people in Europe and North America. And then there is the anti-Israeli
    and anti-Jewish propaganda in the Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority.
    I have a very good friend who lives in Cairo, who reports that most of the Egyptian
    population believes that &#39;the Jews&#39; were responsible for the attack on
    the World Trade Centre and offers as &#39;evidence&#39; the &#39;fact&#39; reported
    in Egyptian newspapers that no Jews showed up for work at the WTC that morning.
    And this is in an Arab country that has a peace treaty with Israel, so one can
    only imagine what the Syrians, Saudis, etc. are being told by their governments.
    <BR> <BR>Rather than &#39;listening to the world&#39;, why not try being committed
    to the truth? There&#39;s plenty of propaganda from both sides to sift through,
    without adding to it by making inapplicable and insupportable accusations of genocide
    and racism.
