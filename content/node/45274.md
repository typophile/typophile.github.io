  need your help in identifying each of these numbers. They are all architectural
  numbers and inscriptions found in Melbourne, Australia and are the source for my
  Honours project.\r\n\r\nI'm no expert in this, but I'm guessing that they're all
  custom? (The '83' looks like an elongated, condensed Bodoni, though). I need to
  know if any of these has been revived or if there's any similar font out there.\r\n\r\nAny
  help will be much appreciated. Thanks.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nChrista\r\n\r\np.s. Another
  thread regarding my project: http://typophile.com/node/45275\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Architectural lettering, especially numbers like these are almost always custom.
    You could find vaguely similar typefaces, but these are not fonts, they are letters.

    of notice of architectural lettering, mainly because I'm kept indoors most hours
    by constant work.\r\n\r\nYour thesis project sounds like a good challenge and
    I hope it bears tasty fruit.\r\n\r\nTypophiles---I don't have time to pick fonts
    with numbers that more or less match the styles in Christa's photos. It would
    be nice if you guys could help her out with such. You'rethe individual face experts,
    not I. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\nj a m e s"

    will go to the City Council tomorrow and see if I can find any information on
    the buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nHi James,\r\nthanks for taking the time to reply, nice
    to find a fellow Melburnian here. I, too, wouldn't have noticed them if I hadn't
    been running away from work and trying to clear my head by walking around the
    city.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nChrista"

    1904 in bronze (copper?), I'll give it an 85% match for Trebuchet bold, if you
    lengthen the tail on the 9 and lop off the serif on the 1.\r\n\r\nThe other ones
    are much harder. You'd need a large catalog of ar'nouveau types to find matches.\r\n\r\nj

  body: "Hi Tiffany,\r\n\r\nSorry for the late reply, uni has kept me really busy.\r\n\r\nI
    find it interesting that the 1904 has such striking resemblance with Gill Sans,
    given that Gill Sans was designed in 1927 and released in 1928. I thought it could
    be Johnston, but I checked around and found out that Johnston was designed in
    1913. Even more intriguing since I found the numbers on a Federation Warehouse
    style building, with no significant history known about it.\r\n\r\nI concur, 83
    is pretty much Bodoni Antiqua Compress Demi Bold.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the
    time to reply!\r\n\r\n\r\nHi James,\r\n\r\nI've been flipping through Art Nouveau
    and display type specimens, there are some similar ones to the 1904 on the bottom
    right corner (found that one on Royal Arcade, btw). I think the rest is all custom.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again. I'll send you an email soon.\r\n\r\nChrista"

    also found out for the 1849 numbers \u2014 I'm still figuring out the correct
    architectural term for this kind of numbers, if there's any \u2014 it was not
    the year in which the building was completed, but the year the Pharmacy company
    (that first owned it) was founded.\r\n\r\n<cite>I would bet just about anything
    that that 1904 plaque was not made in 1904.</cite>\r\nThis might be a silly question,
    but would you care to elaborate why you think so? Again, I am no expert, and my
    research on this particular plaque hasn't been exactly fruitful.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    this might be of interest to some of you \u2014\r\naccording to the records at
    Melbourne City Council, the 1932 was apparently Eric Gill's.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nChrista"

  body: "<em> would you care to elaborate why you think so? </em>\r\n\r\nOn stylistic
    grounds. Monoline sans serif types did exist at the turn of the century (though
    I do think this was based on the later Gill Sans as Tiffany said), but my understanding
    is that they were mostly used as a \"jobbing\" typefaces (for ads and other ephemera).
    So far as I know, they would not have been used to make something as permanent
    and serious as a building plaque. The uneven baseline seems stylistically out
    of character for premodernist design, too. \r\n\r\n<em> the 1932 was apparently
    Eric Gill\u2019s</em>\r\n\r\nInteresting. That pentagonal 1 seems like a Gillish
    quirk."
