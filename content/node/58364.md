    this is what i thought too at first glance,,, but on further inspection the uppercase
    'C's flat ends seem to be more horizontal than Akzidenz... the R right leg is
    dead straight also..\r\n\r\nits a strange one... any more ideas.."

  body: "That \"C\" looks just like Arial to me. :-\\  A little widened, possibly.\r\nActually,
    so does the rest, unless you know that the leg of the \"R\" should be \"dead straight\"?\r\n\r\nEdit:
    OK, that was the joke of the week I guess \u2013 only realized now that thing
    is from the 70s. Haha."

    Extended]]?\r\n\r\nI hate to ask this, but why is it important to be so exact?
    If the Q was the only problem with AG, why not just modify it?\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "its less about the typeface and more the route to the reason for LIKING this
    particular face...ONCE i have de-coded what it is the person who im dealing with
    likes about this, (through identifying the typeface) then i can make adjustments,
    ask more questions and then develop through this channel of thought... its really
    important i think with what im doing... as its all about building an atmosphere...\r\n\r\n\r\nweirdly
    iv looked at arial black again..added a stroke to it and extended it.. horrible
    .. just horrible i know but it looks pritty similar now..\r\n\r\nthanks for the
    suggestions guys\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
