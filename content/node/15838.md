body: I was wondering about the legal implications of editing a pre-existing font...
  If i want to make an adaptation of an existing typeface, is it legal to open it
  in Fontlab and edit it and re-save it as my own? I am trying to create something
  for a design concept I have and don't intend to sell the typeface I create - does
  that make a difference?

    If you want to design a font, do it from scratch.  It is a lot of work but it
    will at least really be your own.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "No, I didn't mean any harm. It's not for a client, its for an independent
    art project. Stealing is not really my thing - the typeface is only a small part
    of the project and I wasn't planning to name the new typeface or distribute it.
    But if I ever choose to circulate the whole project (which will contain the typeface)
    I don't want to experience any legal problems. \r\n\r\nI would also like to know
    why it is illegal... Don't type designers ever redraw or trace type in order to
    make adaptations of it? Didn't Robert Slimbach redraw the work of Garamond? All
    type can be copied by eye or by tracing, even the spacing between it, right? This
    issue feels like a question of individual ethics. It seems to be part of an older
    problem - the difference between 'being influenced' and 'appropriation'. \r\n\r\nIf
    you make something completely different out of something old, does it really matter
    how you got there?\r\n\r\nOr is it about the ease with which the software makes
    the borrowing possible? So it's not what you steal, it's how quickly you do it
    that makes it wrong?"

  body: "Tara, redrawing/retracing is different from reusing the font data itself.
    Consider the imperfect analogy of taking your own photograph of El Capitan vs
    making a photocopy of Ansel Adams'. Mere \"mechanical\" copying typically does
    not differentiate between the copyrightable and noncopyrightable portions of a
    work. If there's any copyrightable data in your finished font that owes its origin
    to the source font, you've constructed a \"derivative work\". Whether constructing
    a particular derivative work is legal depends on the EULA and whether fair use
    is applicable (often tricky to determine).\r\n"

  body: "Hi Novice.\r\nWhen Mr Slimbach made Adobe Garamond, I can pretty much guarantee
    that he didn't open ITC Garamond, Garamond 3, and Stempel Garamond, do some copy'n'pasting
    and make a few tweaks, and voila! Adobe Garamond! He drew all of the letters from
    scratch referencing historical models. \r\n\r\nWhich is legally okay, since the
    models in question are no longer protected by copyright. And there are a lot of
    really talented type \"historical re-enacters\" who make wonderful new forms based
    on historical models. Mr Carter, Mr Porchez, Mr Hoefler, Mr Feliciano, Ms Licko,
    and Mr Storm are among the great talents who have made type based on old models.\r\n\r\nThat
    being said... I fully endorse the exploration of existing fonts for new type designers.
    You can learn a great deal about making type by seeing how the greats make theirs.
    This is akin to listening to Miles Davis's or Charlie Parker's solos; you can
    learn a great deal from attentive listening about structure and phrasing. But
    don't go out and play Miles Davis CD and call it your musicianship, and don't
    learn those solos by rote and perform them and call them original.\r\n\r\nSo.
    As Nick and Tiffany noted, you should read the EULA to see what the publisher
    of the font you are wanting to fiddle with says about such fiddling. For many
    publishers, this kind of fiddling is forbidden, and for some others it is permitted
    within certain constraints. Please do stick to the terms of the EULA; adherence
    to the EULA is the only thing we type publishers ask of our clients, and most
    of us are reasonable small business people, just trying to make a living in a
    risky profession.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    you can't say it's your font.\r\nYou must keep the credits of all the people involved

    what you have modified in the FONLOG.txt file that must be distributed together
    with your new font.\r\n\r\nWhat's your main motivation to edit and existing font?\r\nMaybe
    you want to fix an error, or tweak the spacing or kerning.\r\nMaybe you want to
    change a glyph that you don't like.\r\nMaybe you want to add diacritics to support
    new languages.\r\nMaybe adding ligatures.\r\nMaybe you want to make it a little
    lighter (or bolder, or condensed or wider) to better suit your printing needs.\r\n\r\nI
    see those kind of modifications with good intentions to be perfectly valid, as
    long as you keep the credits of the original designers. Keep in mind that this
    only applies to Open Source fonts, not commercial ones.\r\n\r\nIf you want to
    modify a commercial font, the right thing to do is to contact the original foundry/designer
    first. Some designers allows modifications to create custom branding fonts, some
    charge a little extra money to allowing the modifications, some others don't.\r\nAlways
    ask the original designers first.\r\n"
