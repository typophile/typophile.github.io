  but I can't identify it. I suspect it's a Linotype machine face, judging by the
  buttonhook 'f' and the overly wide italic.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.iampeth.com/books/palmer_method_1935/palmerMethod_1935_page2.html\r\n\r\nI
  particularly like the 'g', which strikes me as rather distinctive.\r\n"

  body: "@fvilanakis Thanks.  It does look like it, doesn't it? \r\n\r\nThe book type
    seems rather less condensed than the digital Century Old Style fonts I see. (Letters
    like 'o' look noticeably rounder, and the tracking in general is much looser.)
    But I supposed that could be accounted for by a different size being used for
    the digital masters."

  body: "Yes, it looks very close and I can't spot a similar /g on any other font
