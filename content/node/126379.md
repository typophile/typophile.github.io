body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a pair of a sans-serif and a serif typefaces
  which have identical metrics to each other. The only genuine one I can find even
  mentioned is <a href=\"http://2015.typographics.com/blog/interchangeable-news-typefaces\">McClatchy
  super-family</a>, but that's a custom commission. Luzi Type's <a href=\"https://luzi-type.ch/messina.html\">Messina</a>
  almost hits the mark (and both the sans and serif are perfect style-wise), but they
  differ just a bit.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? Thanks in advance. "

  body: "Compatil \u2026 take a closer look at spacing and proportions! I do not think
    that typefaces of fundamentally different kinds of stroke contrast like Compatil
    Exquisit (formerly Guardi, an OldStyle/Garalde) and Compatil Text (formerly Centennial,
    a Modern/Didone) should be made fit to the same widths. Apparently that was not
    enough, they also stuck with the practice of the Lino-typical duplex matrices
    for which italic were made fit to the widths of the roman. Look at the o in all
    italics. Instead of being too wide like in Linotype Sabon, the spacing is too
    wide. Designing letterforms and playing the accordeon is not really the same thing
    \u2026"
