  body: "Difficult to choose the best base font. Flange [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FlangeBQAsSierra_4358.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/flange-bq/  might have the best thick-thin
    ratio, appropriate flare serifs and shape for _E_.  Fitz Quadrata is a close second.
    Consider Airam for _S_ and the leg on _R_. Consider Algerian for the _S_.\r\n\r\nThe
    looping tendril and ball ornament on _S_,  _R_ and _A_ is a Victorian  style of
    ornament found on fonts such as Campanile. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CampanileS_5233.jpg]
    I have not included links to the digital versions at the usual \"free\" font sites
    because of piracy issues. The Campanile by Steffmann is a rip of a scan by Aldus
    with some added characters. The OPTI version may be original but is an \"orphan\"
    font from a defunct foundry.  A legitimate version of Campanile by Dan. X. Solo
    is available with purchase of the Dover Book _24 Victorian Display Fonts_ which
    includes a CD-Rom with fonts. Also from Aridi http://www.aridi.com \r\n\r\nThe
    ornamentation is also similar to a dry transfer font called Cardinal by Letraset.

    links to the digital versions at the usual \"free\" font sites because of piracy
    issues.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks each and everyone of you. A chopped off finger tip kept me from the
    computer and I didn't see these additional responses. Today I have to start work
    and all this will be of so much help. THANKS once again.
