body: "I'm looking for comments on the use of Century Gothic or Avant Garde as body
  text, on both web pages and print documents.\r\n\r\nI am hoping to get some professional
  opinions from typographers, designers, editors and even students who feel they have
  gained enough experience to comment on this. I will not state which side of the
  issue I am on, to prevent leading opinion one way or the other.\r\n\r\n(It would
  be really useful to me if you could tag your messages with your name, position,
  and perhaps number of years in Graphic Design ... i.e., Nick Shin, type designer,
  87 years experience. (only kidding Nick).\r\n\r\nA sample of the web page use is
  http://lambton.on.ca.\r\n\r\nA print link (PDF) is usually here, but for some reason
  is coming up blank to me now (but that is another issue) http://www.lambton.on.ca/documents/FT_course_descriptions_jan07.PDF\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any comments you folk can come up with.\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Don,\r\n\r\nI don't much like it in the PDF. The spacing seems bad, and
    I find it hard to read. I have less objection to it on the web, probably because
    from what I saw in the link, the text is in smaller bits and pieces. \r\n\r\nBut
    really, I wouldn't want to have to read or proofread those course descriptions.
    Gotta say, our Calendar isn't any better -- it's set in Arial narrow. I made a
    case for changing it, but somehow that project got buried.\r\n\r\nI am far from
    an expert, and have no formal training, but I've been doing my editing and publication
    design job for a couple of years now.\r\n\r\nKristina\r\n"

  body: "That website shows how typefaces shouldn\u2019t be mixed without at least
    examining them together. That aside, I am not a web designer nor a type designer
    so I don\u2019t know the technical reason, I suspect it is partly hinting, although
    there isn\u2019t much to hint with at that size, but Century Gothic and Avant
    Garde never seem to work on screen unless it is much, much bigger than that or
    a heavier weight, I have a client who uses Century Gothic to send me his corrections
    and in running text it really is too light to follow.\r\n\r\nThe pdf is let down
    by the format, flow, print it philosophy, no care has been taken to keep paragraphs
    together or to keep headings with text and poor judgement of the correct measure
    increases the hyphenation problems that riddle it, those shortcomings all contribute
    to what is ultimately a poor choice of typefaces in extended text.\r\n\r\nTim

    My reaction is that Century Gothic is a poor fit in terms of feel for a very long
    course description document. Something more neutral, like Helvetica or Myriad,
    would convey the information more effectively. Century Gothic feels a bit too
    \"arty\", particularly when it's used to describe science courses. And on the
    website, it just doesn't look very legible - Arial, Verdana or Tahoma. Maybe because
    the College is of \"Applied Arts\", they wanted to go with an arty feeling font?
    But did they forget the \"Technology\"?:-)\r\n\r\nSorry if this is too subjective
    to be helpful."

  body: "Don \u2014 \r\n\r\nITC Avant Garde was never intended as a text face, except
    perhaps in brief ads. Everything about it makes it hard to read en masse. It's
    too big, too round, too undifferentiated (the character shapes are designed to
    look as much like each other as possible, which is the opposite of what makes
    a text face easy to read). And it comes from a period when extra-tight spacing
    was in vogue, which made for some interesting display type (in talented hands)
    but wreaked havoc on text typography.\r\n\r\nThe default spacing in the lighter
    weights of Avant Garde \u2014 including the Book weight and even Medium \u2014
    is much too tight. To make Avant Garde readable in text (it <em>can</em> be done),
    you need to apply noticeably loose tracking (looser the lighter the weight), and
    you need to give it a lot of extra leading. And keep the lines short.\r\n\r\nBut
    why bother? Use a good, readable text face, not one designed to draw attention
    in display use. For listings like the course descriptions in your PDF, Myriad
    might work, or FF Meta or FF Profile or ITC Stone Sans, if you want a sans serif
    face. Helvetica would be a poor choice, because the numerals look too much alike.
    (That's why Helvetica is one of the worst commonly available typefaces for things
    like letterheads and business cards, no matter how often you see it used.) Any
    of these typefaces need careful spacing: enough leading, short enough lines, comfortable
    tracking and kerning. \r\n\r\nThe problems with Avant Garde aren't related to
    how it looks onscreen; it's inappropriate in print, too, for this kind of use.\r\n\r\nEverything
    that can be said about ITC Avant Garde applies to Century Gothic, which is essentially
    an imitation of the same sort of overblown geometrical typeface.\r\n\r\nJohn Berry\r\n"
