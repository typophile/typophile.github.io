body: Hi, <BR>I&#39;m try to import Illustrator eps files into Fontographer 4 on a
  Mac.  The process starts working normally then but then fails with an error message
  saying &#39;Could not complete you request beacuse of a syntax error in the file.
  Code = 11200.&#39;  The eps is fairly simple - just some uncomplicated polygon paths.  I&#39;m
  not sure whether these should be grouped or not?  If anyone could help me with this
  it would be much appreciated.

    You can simply copy and paste following his directions and it should work. This
    guide is what I used when first starting out. It is still helpful. <BR> <BR><a
