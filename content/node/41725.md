body: "This week, the Texas DOT is having an e-vote for our new license plate design.
  There are five designs, including the current plate. As of this morning the vote
  totals are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lone Star Texas\"[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plate_sky_mountains_6076.jpg]39,165\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Natural
  Texas\"[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plate_bluebonnets_6248.jpg]24,759\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Traditional
  Texas\"[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plate_traditional_5056.jpg]18,935\r\n\r\n\r\n\"New
  Texas\"[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plate_skyline_5640.jpg]12,285\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My
  Texas\" (current design)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plate_my_texas_6127.jpg]9.283\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  feel like each one has some detail that bothers me way too much. The red text on
  the blue background of the current design looks a bit off (though it looks better
  when printed on metal).\r\n \r\n\"The Lone Star State\" on the \"Lone Star Texas\"
  design is written in brush script, and \"The\" is  written smaller than \"Lone Star
  State,\" which throws me off.\r\n\r\nThe \"Natural Texas\" design is the most passable
  in my opinion, but that stretched \"The Lone Star State\" at the bottom looks a
  bit off.\r\n\r\nThe \"Traditional Texas\" design just screams \"Look at me! I know
  how to use Photoshop!\"\r\n\r\nI feel like the \"New Texas\" design would be a lot
  more effective with a bold sans serif at the top \u2014 it would make the design
  look a lot more clean and modern.\r\n\r\nHere's the site for voting:\r\nhttp://apps.dot.state.tx.us/services/vehicle_titles_and_registration/vote_plate.htm\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?"

  body: Graphically I like the bottom three (that last one SCREAMS kitsch, they threw
    the kitchen sink at it, but I voted for it). I'd like the second to bottom one
    much better if the Texas wasn't in script. Which is what you said. I really hate
    the top two - I don't tend to like pictorial license plates.

  body: 'A version of the last one has been around for a while. I like the traditional
    one. I don''t want a license plate messing up the look of my car. I would rather
    have a really traditional one with a plain white bg and black letters. '

  body: "The europeans get these right. All these are not so hot. Not everyone wants
    a bunch of colorful graphics on their car, just like not everyone puts bumper
    stickers on their car. We are forced to put one on the front and back. Why not
    have a clean simple option.\r\n\r\nI get the one that helps funds the state parks,
    which isn't featured."

  body: I liked the old days where it was just color on color, all stamped. NY was
    orange on blue and then (radical!) they reversed the colors.

    not even going to fuss about the letterspacing. ^This approach is so much better.
    The function of the tag is to ID the vehicle and identify the state. We just don't
    need cowboys, spaceships, oil rigs, etc. (God I sound like a grumpy old idiot!)"
