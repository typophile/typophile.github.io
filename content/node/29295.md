  swash. Can anybody identify it? Is it available in digital format? Any help, as
  always, appreciated. '

    normally has ''wings'' on the v and w, and that L is not any normal Caslon. '

  body: So if not Caslon, what? Or is the implication that this is hand drawn? The
    uniformity of the letters suggests a typeface to me. Does any font have an L like
    that?

  body: I think the drawing is based on Caslon italic, but no, I don't think any Caslon
    has a swash L like that. I don't know whether it would have been cut in metal
    or what--perhaps someone who knows more printing history could tell you.
