  body: "Thanks malbright!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looks pretty close, although there seems
    to be a small difference in the lowercase y:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/you_are_here_tokyo_3528.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eurostile_5935.jpg]
    \r\n(Eurostile Demi)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know the right words to describe it,
    but that sort of step at the junction of the two strokes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's close
    enough for me, more for the record really.\r\n\r\n\r\nEver the cheapskate, probably
    my real question is can anyone suggest a free alternative?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nnikki"

    (means \u201CNew Sans Serif\u201D in Japanese), a Japanese popular modern sans
    serif font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Shingo_3898.jpg]\r\n\r\nOf
    course, the latin characters of ShinGo is based on Eurostile but rounder than
    Eurostile.\r\n\r\nBTW \u201CYOU ARE HERE\u201D set in ShinGo is condensed around
    94%.\r\n\r\n- Akira\r\n"
