  thinking the corrections haven\u2019t been made.\r\nc.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_6581.jpg]"

    To change the Autohint preferences, hold the Ctrl key while you click on the Play
    button.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AH_prefs_4876.png]\r\n\r\n>
    <em>Are these corrections the macro has made, or are these corrections I need
    to make.</em>\r\n\r\nThe macro won't make any changes to the outlines, unless
    you allow it (not recommended). You can think of it as a report of suggestions.
    For example, seems like you've setup a standard stem with the value 57. When the
    autohint macro finds outlines where the stems are not exactly that value, it flags
    a near miss."

    doesn\u2018t have to mean that there is actually someting that need to be corrected.\r\n\r\nIn
    this example, the Autohinter is telling me that it\u2019s a near miss between
    665 and 700. This is the place where i want my outline to bend a little bit -
    and that makes it different from the standard stem width. It\u2019s a inner shape
    of a capital D, that is supposed to be there. The autohinter is giving me the
    exact position where this occurs \u2013 the curve begins at 35 and then eventually
    goes up to 34.\r\n\r\nAnd in this case 34 is a standard stem width.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/autohint_dee_4065.png]"
