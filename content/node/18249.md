  in your room, kerning and moaning, and do you want to get out? Come on over to my
  place.\r\n\r\nHit the 'placemarks' to find me in Google Earth. I'm working in two
  locations, in Maastricht and D\xFCsseldorf:\r\nhttp://www.characters.nl/downloads/ReneVerkaart-CharactersNL.kmz\r\nhttp://www.characters.nl/downloads/ReneVerkaart-CharactersD.kmz\r\n\r\nor
  use the zipped files:\r\nhttp://www.characters.nl/downloads/ReneVerkaart-CharactersNL.kmz.zip\r\nhttp://www.characters.nl/downloads/ReneVerkaart-CharactersD.kmz.zip\r\n\r\nFor
  those poor guys who don't have Google Earth yet:\r\nhttp://earth.google.com/download-earth.html\r\n\r\nBest

    visited all the places I always wanted to see. I just wish they would photograph
    more places with more details. Most of the american places are photographed in
    hogher resolution than the places over here in Europe. When they do you'll be
    able to see more clearly where I live too.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\xAE\r\n\r\nwww.characters.nl
