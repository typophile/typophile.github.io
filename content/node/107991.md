  place to share my latest work.\r\nA calendar made of two thousand and fourteen keyboard
  keys.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nTo upfront the production costs I did a Kickstarter campaign
  with an explanatory video that can be seen here:\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107717342/2014-typographic-wall-calendar\r\n\r\n<iframe
  width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107717342/2014-typographic-wall-calendar/widget/video.html\"
  frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"> </iframe>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HOORAY-Harald-Geisler-Typographic-Wall-Calendar_5314.gif]\r\nHorray!
  The campaign was funded successfully on 31. Dec 2013. \r\nThe print size is A0 (84cm
  x 118,8cm) and reproduces the composition in its original size.\r\nNow it is available
  through my website:\r\nhttp://haraldgeisler.com/order-prints\r\n\r\nSince you are
  all contributing to this <strong>wonderful</strong> forum that I find it often very
  <strong>helpful ( & sometimes entertaining)</strong> to read in, I would like to
  make you a offer:\r\n\r\n<strong>Order one signed Print (25\u20AC) and I will send
  you additional four prints for free (a total of five) - and 14 Typographic Postcards
  (see pictures below)! </strong>\r\n\r\nSimply drop me a line after you have placed
  your order - I will then add the extra copies and postcards.\r\n\r\nBefore you ask:
  \ Yes the shipping is super expensive. The shipping is so expensive for a reason:
  the poster is rolled in placed in a poster tube(expensive) and simply very long
  (112cm) \u2014 to ship something that big is expensive.\r\n\r\nThis is what the
  print looks like:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2014-Montage---druckfertig-iso300-1200px-breit_5411.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  hope you enjoy the work.\r\nTypographic or non-typographic feedback either directly
  or through mail is welcome.\r\nSpreading the word is appreciated.\r\n\r\n<em>Yours
  Sincerely & HAPPY NEW YEAR!,\r\nHarald Geisler</em>\r\n\r\nHere are the Postcards
  (in total there are 14 motives included in the set - all reproduce the keys in their
  original size):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Imissyou_5997.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/EmailMe_5677.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/HappyNewYear_6398.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/thankyou_4578.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hello_5349.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/YesNoMaybe_3973.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/writing_5954.jpg]"
