  of salon identities that seem to be all similar.\r\n\r\nThats why i pose the question
  here.\r\n\r\n1609(yes its the address)is the new name of this salon. This place
  had existed for the past 11 years under a different name, but had to rebrand for
  reasons you can make a reasonable guess, but which i won't disclose.\r\n\r\nWhen
  the name turned over, so did the ownership or at least the person who's name is
  listed as such. So physically they are the same staff, management and service, but
  under a  different name.\r\n\r\nWell...i don't know how many of you have done jobs
  where a number was the name, but it is not an easy feat. Generally, i avoided drawing
  figurative aspects of the business into the mark. Since they are a \"salon & spa\"
  they offer a wide ranges of services that cannot be wittled to wavy locks or leaves.
  With them being one of the hipper places in the city to get your hair cut, the goal(with
  the client's vision)was to find a strong solution that has the potential to be an
  iconic mark, that symbolizes the attitude and quality of this salon.\r\n\r\nIm just
  going to get out of the way and let you go at it.\r\n\r\njp"

    variation of this theme using a less geometric font, or something thinner?  But
    I guess it can't be too historical looking or people will think 1609 represents
    the year.\r\n\r\nI think you're off to a great start!\r\n\r\n"

    und es schaut sehr schwerfallig. Ich habe die \"6\" und \"9\" Charakter ein bisschen
    gedreht, aber habe ich kein Gluck.\r\n\r\ndan - I am not really a big fan of script
    faces. If they are in some kind of vogue, i would have to see the application
    to decide. For this project the client and I believe on creating a strong presence,
    that has some visual mass with a bit of elegance. \r\n\r\nIn the three block area
    there are a variety of places to get you hair cut. Some are cheapo chains, the
    other look retro 80's, to the harmonious Aveda look. Seemingly its is always about
    blending in the salon industry. \r\n\r\nWe are trying to punch it up a little
    bit. Though not known as agressive or anything the client really want to be closer
    to Nylon than Elle. They aren't cutesy and to retain the small male clientele
    base they have, they want to have their service be known, not a bias toward sexes.
    Script has a definite slant toward women. I know its not all very feminine and
    its very classic, but its a direction that does not fit the client.\r\n\r\nEric
    -  I think you mean with less contrast or maybe i don't fully understand the meaning
    of contrast, but a thinner weight in commoner terms. Gotcha."

  body: "Hey there, Josh,\r\n\r\nWhile I like the variations 1a through f very much,
    still I feel they are not the potentially iconic mark the salon looks for. Maybe
    that's because of the ornamented treatment you use. Correct me if I am wrong,
    but isn't iconicity rather related to visual simplicity? In that sense, the 'sixteen
    O nine' sketches do a better job. The O could be the very icon you are looking
    for.\r\n\r\nYou say the salon wants it's quality and attitude reflected, so maybe
    a bold choice for a very simple mark might be the thing. To my eyes the ornaments
    have a hip feel, but will they be as hip three years from now? Using a relatively
    simple logo and allowing some time for it to be filled with meaning may be a much
    better choice.\r\n\r\nStill, I enjoy looking at the ornaments... :-)\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nMy

  body: "as this is a hip salon spa I think the hip edgy nature of the first series
    is probably more suited. Like all things of a trendy nature, you may find that
    the identity is somewhat ephemeral and will need to be revisited more often then
    that of say a bank (hee hee). \r\nHaving said that - I like 1c and 1d, but I think
    that the actual type could be just a bit more legible - easier to distinguish
    at first glance what the markings are. I was looking for letter forms that weren't
    there instead of OH DUH NUMBERS! So perhaps look for a face with attitude and
    weight and ornament those. I think it is crazy on the right track because it looks
    very hip. You have to almost alwasy imagine how a salon logo would look printed
    fairly small in the center of a black t-shirt on some stylist with the sleeves
    rolled up slightly (smirk). In this case it works."

    down the trendy as a trade-off for the iconic/longevity qualities, then I'd go
    with the 'sixteen O nine'. The first one is the weakest in that series, so I'd
    choose from the other three."

    to them, they are pursuing the forementioned(by other users)work mark ala \"sixteen

    it all must be pretty pretty in the end, the interesting part of this solution
    is the way the number is said. Naturally as humans we are lazy at times and often
    give a \"zero\" an \"oh\" treatment when we speak. So this solution naturally
    evolved. Hopefully I can strike a balance with the traditions/similarities of
    salon branding and interjecting some fresh, yet sturdy typography to create a

    Just imagine. Way to ruin the day, Adnix.\r\n\r\nI met with some fellow designers
    today and they were not really discouraged by some of the marks, but more of my
    selling the idea. So i included some new and older marks with some new approaches
    above(see t_shirts)as applied hypothetically to a t-shirt. Not everyone knows
    a good mark when they see it alone and that the sense i am getting with my client.
    So im going to apply it and see if one can be sold in his mind.\r\n\r\nThanks

    play rather than salon and for the life of me I can't figure out why. The ones
    with the extra large O for keep reminding me of the cirque du soleil show O and
    though they don't have a corner on the O market with Oprah Magazine and others

    hip and edgy then some of these are working.\r\n\r\nAs far as design goes I think
    the third one down in the first file is the best. The mark is great but it doesn't

    handle -- call it \"3b?\" BUT, I think some might read it as \"sixteen nine\"
    rather than \"sixteen o nine.\" \r\n\r\nThe first series actually confused me.
    I though \"1c,\" which adnix describes as \"the towel-headed girl\" was a finger/fingernail
    with some fancy polish design. The good thing is that whether its a towel head
    or a fingernail, they both just happen to work for a salon. Did you plan it that
    way? Am I the only one to interperetet as such?\r\n\r\nBack to \"3b.\" Both \"6\"
    and \"9\" offer an opportunity to show the scissors handle concept. I would experiment
    with that. I think you can push this a lot further. I like Dan W's suggestion
    to incorporate a \"Salon & Spa\" line, and in a contrasting face. If your going
    to produce ephemera (t-shirts, etc) you don't want people not knowing it's a Salon.
    Other than \"3b,\" I see the design on a t-short and be like 'hmm, what's sixteen
    o nine? At least if Salon and Spa was there I would know what to tell information
    when trying to find a phone #.\r\n\r\nI used to not be too keen on script faces
    myself, but you can do wonderful things contrasting a clean sans with a script.
    Think about it. Keep sketching. Looking forward to the next iterations. One last
    thing, a lot of people mentioned a thinner stroke for the sans, I agree."
