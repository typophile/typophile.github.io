  body: Why are there so many composite glyphs in Ed Interloc? Wouldn't it have been
    more logical to have separate sets of "left" and "right" glyph components, and
    construct the "ligatures" from these on the fly?

  body: Chris, I was not meaning to be (too) bitchy. It's just that Mr Daniels has
    the Seahawks helmet as his identifier, and for a spell also had the SuperBowl
    XL logo alongside it. I notice that the SuperBowl logo has disappeared, while
    the helmet remains, which says to me that Mr Daniels is a true fan of his beloved
    team, and I applaud that. He doesn't need the Seahawks to be the Galactic Champions
    for him to love them. (As a Montrealer, and once fan of the Expos, I know  all
    about sports-based disappointment.)

    it have been more logical to have separate sets of \u201Cleft\u201D and \u201Cright\u201D
    glyph components,  and construct the \u201Cligatures\u201D from these on the fly?</cite>\r\n\r\nNot
    really. That would be the logical approach if all the letterforms had uniform
    widths, but that's not the case. For example, the <strong>I</strong> doesn't occupy
    the same width as the <strong>O</strong>. So the <strong>M</strong> in a <strong>MI</strong>
    ligature must be different from the <strong>M</strong> in a <strong>MO</strong>
    ligature. As Ken worked through the task of drawing all 1,400 ligatures, he would
    adjust forms as needed to make each individual ligature look perfect. Automatically
    assembled ligatures would not have had that same attention to detail and the organic
    qualities of the face would have been lost. In cases like this, automation always
    yields to aesthetics.\r\n\r\nBecause the decision was made to hand build all the
    ligatures, we never really looked into assembling them on the fly. I have some
    ideas about how that could be done with a combination of contextual lookups, kerning
    and <em>lots</em> of alternate glyphs, but it would be a big can of worms."

    was probably thinking of the Apple AAT version of Zapfino, which Ross and I produced.
    Adam was responsible for the OT version with its clever pseudo-random stuff. Of
    course, no mention of either current version of Zapfino should exclude Akira Kobayashi,
    who worked on the design revision with Hermann.\r\n\r\nIf I were to form an OT
    team for Si's list, I think it would have to be the Hebrew Hounds with Ralph Hancock,
    or maybe the Torah Tigers. All this fancy Latin display typography is a nice light
    pre-season workout, but I really don't think you've broken a sweat if the game
    doesn't require additions to Unicode, changes to the way VOLT works, changes to
    the way Uniscribe works, and six months in the locker room listening to people
    shout about why Phoenician is or is not the same thing as Hebrew.\r\n_\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    kudos indeed to Tal, and congratulations to whoever won that silly game with all
    the padding. I leave you with <a href=\"http://gvod.blogspot.com/2006/02/rugby-tackles-ouch.html\">a
