  they did not use \"old western-y\" typography for this film since it is a modern
  remake. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for your time and response. \r\n\r\nAt first, I wasn't too sure
    if it was Rockwell. I have never paid attention to some of the pointy elements
    like the M. I could have knew better. \r\n\r\nI thought the title was well done
    but I cringed at the treatment of \"punishment - comes one way or another\". I
    personally think they could have used a different font for actor's names. Rockwell
    condensed is definetely an awkward choice. I guess it is just the legenth of the
    name made it appear so awkward. \r\n\r\n"

  body: BTW the directors' names seem to be set in something else, it reminds me of
    Giza by FontBureau but it's not it I think.

    is better with the treatment of the actor's names? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/true_grit_ver7_5099.jpg]"
