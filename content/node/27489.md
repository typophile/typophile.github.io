body: "Hello All-\r\n\r\nThis has been bugging me for a couple of weeks. Searched
  through the wiki,  looked through the old posts etc and still no luck.  I'm looking
  for a foundry thats based in the UK I think, deals primarily with techno-ish fonts.
  Similar to the Core-77  Design Directory display face.  I had found it before but
  didnt bookmark it for some reason.\r\n\r\nVery mechanical / square forms. Monospaced.
  Thin line weights.\r\n\r\nThanks, any help would be greatly appreciated.  "
