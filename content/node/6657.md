  body: yeah i got this email this morning. i think the 3 italics idea is very cool.
    it&#39;s stuff like that that makes me excited &#40;nothing funny!&#41; about
    type.

  body: I think this new typeface from Underware shows more proof that there are still
    new frontiers to discover in type design. In their work I see a refusal to settle
    on following what has been done before and an insistance on showing us what is
    to come in the future. I love it!

  body: I guess some people need a hammer hit over the head as proof that an idea
    is good. I was evangelizing multiple italics -preferably uniwidth- three years
    ago on the TD list &#40;and elsewhere&#41;. But back then it was a stupid idea
    coming from a nobody, of course. <BR> <BR>The font is great though. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Well, it seems that it was actually the RdR committee&#39;s idea, three centuries
    ago! But you&#39;re right, I should have applied it, not just talked about it.
    On the other hand, I think it&#39;s important to appreciate theory &#40;no matter
    where it&#39;s coming from&#41; irrespective of practice. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Well, Hrant, I am a HUGE fan of variety and options. You should starting creating
    and show everyone how it is done! ;^&#41;

  body: i&#39;d agree that theory should be respected. i&#39;m afraid that i don&#39;t
    know much of any type theory. anything i should be reading up on? or just be doing
    more reading in general? I&#39;m afraid my thinking is not far enough outta the
    box to come up with such concepts myself &#40;yet&#41;. <BR>but... putting theory
    into application has the exacty effect that you said... it packs a powerful punch!
