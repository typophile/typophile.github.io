body: This is nuetron, a working title for a font inspired by Andreas Lindholm&#39;s
  industrial work. The lower specimen is perhaps a cleaner, more effective face, but
  offers fewer original elements. L through o, for example. <BR> <BR>The top variant
  is the direction I want to go in, really dive into the chaotic, you know? But I
  suspect there are too many sub-elements to keep everything looking like a family.
  Look at the rounded corners clashing with the angled ones. Then add the battling
  angles of the w, o, and x, and. That x is giving my fits. Character widths seem
  to be difficult here, for me too. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll keep trying to make the upper
  version work, but in the meantime, does anyone have any help to offer? <BR> <BR>As
  with Atom, once I get everything in order with this face, I&#39;ll shrink it down
  50% and produce a more traditional screen font. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14088.gif"

  body: i like some of the letters, but i can&#39;t really read the words in white.  not
    because they&#39;re low-contrast, but because all the letters look the same.  something
    like this, to me, is only good for a single word logotype, because if it were
    a title for something, and the title was many words, i&#39;d be confused in reading
    it.  with a logotype, it&#39;s ok to be a little illegible.  one thing that confuses
    me in trying to decipher what those words say is the word-spacing.  maybe space
    out the words another pixel or two.  i&#39;ve been glancing up at the font while
    writing this and i still can&#39;t tell what those words say. <BR> <BR>g looks
    like a b <BR>e looks like a p <BR>p looks like the r <BR>in the top version, the
    L looks out of place <BR> <BR>will there be numbers?  because the q looks like
    a 9.

  body: Tyler, <BR>the &#34;X&#34; feels a bit unbalanced compared to the rest of
    the letters. The middle part &#40;on the baseline&#41; feels too thick. Try to
    solve this and you have something better than my old ones...! <BR> <BR>Andreas

  body: Okay, I&#39;ve tweaked the name a little bit here, so it doesn&#39;t look
    like a typo. It&#39;s really just a working title anyway. <BR> <BR>Jim, I began
    exploring some lighter weights. At first I tried to stick to the point size previously
    established by the original weight. Thus the top two versions. I tried to take
    some of the weight out of the vertical axis, but it didn&#39;t look so hot. The
    second version looks better, but is still a bit out of proportion. So I broke
    down and started downsizing vertically. Any opinions here? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14194.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>Andreas, I can&#39;t emphasize enough how cool it is to have
    your input. Your d b and e characters were too cool not to play around with! I
    love your work. Totally unique. I&#39;ve been playing with the x &#40;it&#39;s
    amazing how many variants are possible with pixel grids&#41; and here are two
    that work a little better. I had to cheat it in there, as you can see. The baseline
    is super-elevated, and the descenders aren&#39;t as long as the rest of the set.
    What do you think? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14195.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>Hrant, thanks for your post. I&#39;m glad to have borrowed your
    critical eye!

  body: Tyler, <BR>I&#39;m glad you like my input! <BR>I think the X is loosing the
    harmony compared to the rest. Maybe you could try to turn it upside down, or replace
    the left or right descender with a dot? A hybrid of some sort...? <BR> <BR>Keep
    it up! <BR> <BR>Andreas

  body: Andreas, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been tweaking away and come up with this variant.
    It follows the lines of the other characters a little better, but it definately
    relies on the rest of the word to give it its meaning. <BR> <BR>Also, setting
    these test words lets me see the a and o need some rethinking. <BR> <BR>What do
    you think of this direction? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14238.gif"
