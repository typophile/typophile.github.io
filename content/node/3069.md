  body: Pretty neat, Craig. I like the vaguely cyrillic undercurrents in some of the
    glyphs. <BR> <BR>The T, for me, is definitely weak. With the X and Z I think you
    have to bite the bullet and use diagonal strokes. <BR> <BR>I think you should
    add a heavy foot to the Y seeing as it&#39;s the only glyph without one.

    photoshop&#41; in to fontographer. Problem: Auto trace is turning some lines that
    should be straight in to curves... very annoying. Does anyone have any advice
    for how to correct this? <BR>-Craig '

  body: ' You can fool with the autotrace parameters, but I wouldn&#39;t use autotrace
    for such a geometric design anyway, because you&#39;re gonna waste a lot of time
    tweaking the different parts &#40;like the stems&#41; to have the exact same dimension.
    Do put the images in the background, but start tracing over them manually, and
    rely on copy-pasting the modular parts as much as possible. <BR> <BR>hhp '
