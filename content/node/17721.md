    pages using the \"Print Sample Pages\" function. It works well, but customization
    is limited.\r\n\r\nI would also be interested in seeing if there are any other
    programs out there that allow for more powerful layout options.\r\n"

    list of font names in its font style . With so many fonts I don't want to print
    pages of a-z 1-10 at different sizes. \r\nAnybody know the answer to that one?"
