body: Can anyone ID this font for me? We think the main type is Baskerville but we&#39;re
  not positive. What about the ampersand? Which font do you think it came from? <BR>

  body: I&#39;d say the ampersand is by Goudy, but I need to check that.

  body: I&#39;m not so sure I agree with Baskerville. The &#39;e&#39; has a slightly
    slanted bar, and the &#39;f&#39; has a shallower &#39;crook&#39; than any Baskerville
    I am seeing. The ampersand could have come from a collection of ampersands like
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/ampersands/" target="_blank">these
    two fonts</a> from Castle Type.

  body: I believe this is Times Roman. It appears to be cut or cast letters applied
    to a wall and some of them &#40;like the e&#41; are a bit crooked. The baseline
    is also crooked and the spacing is a bit loose and uneven.

  body: I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re totally right on the Times Roman thing... the
    ampersand, well, I can&#39;t find a Goudy one that matches. Goudy Heavystyle is
    similar but not even really close. I looked through those sets of ampersands and
    I found one close but it didn&#39;t have the roundness on the last bit of the
    curve ?

  body: Also, I think it has been stretched a little horizontally. <BR> <BR>I should
    note that I&#39;m having trouble finding a precise match with any of the common
    digital versions of Times. But I don&#39;t think that means it&#39;s not Times.
    There are so many versions of this face--both authorized and unauthorized. It
    might also be pre-digital. <BR> <BR>In any case, I am convinced that it is some
    version of Times.

  body: As for the ampersand, it&#39;s a little like the one in <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cooper-black/cooper-black/testdrive.html?s=%26&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Cooper Black</a>, too. My gut feeling is that it was custom designed.

  body: Yeah, I had come to the Cooper conclusion as well. Unfortunately  <BR>no match.
