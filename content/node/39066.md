    each hatch...  (you would know what I mean if you have followed LOST)\r\nthe DHARMA
    in the previous thread is another. it looks more like woodblock-kind-of-type...
    \ or if you cut it in linoleum\r\n\r\nthanx for pointing me to that thread...
    \ I was wondering what the hieroglyphs said. Yesterday I looked in my mums old
    book of hieroglyphs trying to see if I could get an answer...  but instead I got
    it here at this terrific forum."
