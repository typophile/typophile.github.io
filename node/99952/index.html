Take a look at the way letters are constructed and then rework your lettering. Logo, Font & Lettering Bible by Leslie Cabarga is a good source of information if you need some reading about font designing.

I prepared some sketches for the client and he pick up this one.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MORE_sketch_5398.JPG]
Is'a a really free sketch, perhaps too free, but in a way it suits the festival. So my task is to vectorize it. And now I see that there might be more than one vector interpretation.

It's not an easy task for me so I would very appreciate any tips on it.

If it's the former (which I personally would hope) then I might suggest constructing this with hundreds of fine lines that criss-cross and jump around.

@Vykintas: what's the story behind this signage? Is it just something "they liked" or is there more to it? Does it have any meaning as it is at the moment? Because first and foremost I couldn't even by being totally whacked relate this to a music festival... And especially not Venice. :) But hey that's just me. And no offence I'm just asking directly without wrapping it in nice paper. It's supposed to get you through quicker and to better result.</div>

I quickly ran your sketch through Ps to punch up that line work and keep as much shading as time would allow (GO BRUINS GO) and then in Illy did a trace...

I had an ulterior motive. To be honest, your logo looked to me more like a logo for a machine shop than an arts festival. Sorry, but that was my reaction. So I was trying to think of ways to keep the same general treatment but add some elements to give it a look which I associate more with festivals (fun, energetic, colorful, artistic, exciting, etc.)

But I find 5stars' sketch (suggested by hrant) an interesting direction to explore. It's softer and more artistic looking. Maybe try some different media (charcoal, watercolor, etc.) Or maybe juxtapose rigid, carefully-drawn elements with hand drawn ones.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow ! I didn't expect so many comments. Thanks to all of you !

@hrant : It's the « core structures » that we are interested in. But the « hundreds of fine lines » – it's really an idea ! Is it technically possible (not too complicated at least) to accomplish that in TypeTool3 ? I mean I guess technically you cannot have a line in TypeTool ?

@litera : It's something they liked :) I should have added that electronic music is going to play an important role in this festival.

@5star : Thanks for the sketch ! The core forms are really more obvious now.

And there's a technical question. Is it possible to automatically round corners in TypeTool ? Of course I would adjust and polish them after it. But automatic corner rounding would be a very good tool to get the initial impression.</div>
