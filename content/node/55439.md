body: Is it normal that a big print shop requires that all the texts have to be converted
  to outlines? (I mean that is their <em>standard</em> 'policy')

  body: "They don\u2019t want to read the EULAs and they don\u2019t want to buy the
    fonts. They just want to RIP the job, print it, and go on to the next. This is
    how they put the responsibility on you to get it right. They also dislike making
    changes and sending proofs out, which delays their schedule.\r\n\r\nLook around
    at all your alternatives and find the shop that has the right presses, operators,
    and work flow for you."

  body: Check it carefully, convert it, and charge the client to redo the preflight
    if they come back with changes.

  body: Sounds like one of those two guys with a digital press in a garage working
    on tiny margins shops. Just outline the type and let the client live with the
    results; this is what he gets for being a tightwad.

  body: "James, it is a relatively big print shop (relative to the place where I live),
    but the mentality is still that of \u201Ctwo guys with digital press etc.\u201D,
    very common in Italy (and particularly in central Italy, I suspect I also share
    the same behaviour). Another printer months ago <em>rasterized</em> everything
    before printing without even calling me, and then he tried to put the blame on
    me for the results."

  body: "Probably what they did was to create a workflow where font issues are over!
    All is converted to outlines by the designer. They are saving big time on the
    operation, cause fonts issues suck.\r\n\r\nA side-effect to this practice is that
    the files will be way bigger then if the text was regular embed fonts on PDFs,
    costing more time and memory to convert files.\r\n\r\nTell them!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I also think that the print quality would suffer at text sizes, as hints are
    out. Is this right?

  body: Hinting is irrelevant at 2,000+ dpi used with offset printing today. I'm assuming
    this is "printing," not xerography. In fact, in the early PostScript days, I use
    to strip the hints out of fonts because they sometimes caused trouble. Type was
    output to repro paper at "only" 1,200 dpi. But that was a true 1,200, not tricked.

  body: "<em>Probably what they did was to create a workflow where font issues are
    over!</em>\r\n\r\nI think you are correct. I suppose the so-called workflow was
    created to avoid problems and be able to print \u2018just-in-time\u2019 with the
    lowest prices. The quality problems are the last thing to be considered in that
    context. I find the approach really depressing.\r\n"
