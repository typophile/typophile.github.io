  seems to be several schools of wisdom on approaching typesetting  ragged right copy:\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Sort widows and orphans, no hyphenation, turn over all overhanging small words \u2013
  and smoothing out heavily ragged text (this creates shapes that this article frowns
  on http://www.fonts.com/aboutfonts/articles/finetypography/ragswidowsorphans.htm)\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Have a balanced rag, not turning over small words etc, sort areas where optical
  shapes are created in the margin \u2013 as described in the link above.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Sort widows and orphans \u2013 leave everything else.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Little or no
  typesetting of the rag itself and possible use of hyphenation, see Grid Systems
  in Graphic Design by JMB-Brockmann.\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to know what the typophile
  conventional wisdom is on this subject. It's not covered at any length by Bringhurst
  I don't think.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

    and language, but also taste. Having no hyphenation at all combined with not too
    wide columns simply won\u2019t work for German.\r\nHere\u2019s a recent find from
    a German news website:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zeit_6218.png]"

  body: I think the rag smoothing on the second yellow sample still needs to have
    the word "or" pushed to the last line.

  body: "This too is a question of style, and related to the job at hand.\r\nYou might
    want to give the impression that you don\u2019t care about the shape of the rag,
    to the extent that you take pains to deliberately make it gnarly.\r\nOr you might
    want to make it sweet and smooth.\r\nOr you might want to relate it to, or echo,
    another graphic element on the page, a picture for instance, or the shape of a
    headline or an adjacent column.\r\nOr you might break it prosodically, or according
    to the meaning of the text. \r\n\r\nHow the page looks and reads is important
    (which is, after all, Brighurst\u2019s \uFB01rst point), not making sure that
    procedures conform to disembodied standards that do not take into account the
    text or the page layout.\r\n\r\n"
