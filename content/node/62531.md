  for Hyper Island was to make a short animation to be completed in an accelerated
  schedule of only 24 hours based on something that you like.\r\n\r\nI am honored
  that he chose a typeface of mine, and am blown away by the results. Hopefully you
  will appreciate it as well.\r\n\r\nMotion design by Steffen Knoesgaard\r\nAudio

    foundry but 30 second commercials are a great way to promote fonts I hope we'll
    be seeing more of that in the coming years.\r\nMaybe not on national TV."
