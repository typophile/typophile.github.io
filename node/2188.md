  I M CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR RECENT FONTS, THE TRENDY TYPES FOUND ALL OVER THE INTERNATIONAL
  PRESS THIS LAST TWO YEARS AND HARDLY AVAILABLE FROM CLASSICAL FOUNDRIES, BUT I WOULDNT
  BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE PRECISELY THE KIND OF FAMILY THEY BELONG TO...I M LOOKING MOST
  OF ALL FOR LOOPED FONTS, WHICH SEEM TO BE DRAWN FROM A SINGLE AND CURVY LINE, ALMOST
  SCRIPT WITH A STRONG MODERN STYLE AND THICK LINES...LET S SAY THE KINDA FONTS THAT
  THE &#34;BAUHAUS&#34; AND &#34;FRANKFURTER&#34;GAVE BIRTH TO.   DO I EXPRESS MYSELF
  CLEARLY ENOUGH? I DO HOPE SO...IF ANYBODY CAN PROVIDE ME NAMES OF FONTS AS WELL
  AS COMPANIES, I LL BE GREATLY THANKFULL AND PLEASED !  <BR>THANX IN ADVANCE FOR
  ANY KIND OF HELP ! '

    your velocity in helping people!! This Trisect type is more or less EXACTLY &#40;let
    me please shout this out loud!!&#41; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> what i m looking for...the last issue of The Face has
    been entirely designed with some kinda similar font, i ll scan and post this asap...it
    s even nicer than the Trisect...The core of my question was : are these fonts
    being edited and sold or are they just the result of some zealous &#40;unemployed?&#41;
    designer...Now got clearer ideas, thanx a lot to you guys!!'
