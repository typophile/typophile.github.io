  first appearance is at 0:05 on the lower half, then it appears frequently in the
  form of subtitles. I REALLY need this font ASAP!\r\n\r\nIts most prominent feature
  are the extended/elongated lowercase \"T\"s and \"F\"s.\r\n\r\nI have also attached
  two screenshots of the font.\r\n\r\nAny and all posts are greatly appreciated!!"
