    public resource for fonts, news and reviews</cite>\r\n\r\nHaven't we already got
    that right here on typophile?\r\n\r\ni suggest someone starts to write reviews
    on typophile! the reviews could be sorted under their own folder in the forum.
    I suggest two solutions:\r\n\r\n1) the reviews are \"official\" typophile reviews.
    The reviewers are nominated (is that an english word?) by the editors (whoever
    they are). Only these reviewers are allowed to start review threads, but everyone
    is welcome to comment/discuss. This solution would ignite much debate over who
    is allowed to review, whether the editors are biased, and so on. That is, of course,
    a good thing. One problem is whether the odd \"what do you think about my new
    font\" is considered a review when people start answering. then , essentially
    everyone gets to write reviews.\r\n\r\n2) Everyone gets to review, just make a
    new category under the forums folder. Pro: more democracy. Con: Everyone gets
    to write  reviews, which would lead to a lot af debate about the quality of the
    reviews, the objectivity of the writers and so on. \r\n\r\ni vote for number 1.\r\n\r\nalex\r\n\r\n\r\n.........................................................\r\n<a

  body: alex, ideally, this type of info could be housed in the wiki area. there are
    already several threads for individual [[typefaces]], these could be expanded
    by anyone who cares to include reviews of these faces. in fact, i believe that
    the article on [[Mrs Eaves]] has some discussion about the pros and cons of that
    particular typeface. This could be improved upon, of course, perhaps wiki contributors
    could start adding a section entitled "Review" to articles on typefaces.

    not that he is really reviewing them.\r\n\r\nIdealy what I would love to find

    i guess it all depends on what you mean by \"review.\" i was thinking of some

  body: ">i like when there are reviews on typographer.org or typographica\r\n\r\nI
    agree with you Paul about how interesting these are. And if Typophile could foster
    them, and maybe collect references to outside reviews--typographica, John Berry,
    typographer.org, etc.--it would be great. \r\n\r\nI think you are onto something
    in thinking that a wiki-like structure would be good. That is, you have the name
    of the typeface as the title, and then people can add comments. But for this kind
    of thing, because it is a review, it might be best to have them added as signed
    entries, rather than combined into one. \r\n\r\nIt is really a lot of work to
    do a typeface review responsibly, as Yves did with his Fleishmann revival extravaganza.
    This is because it involves testing the typeface in its intended context. But
    it would be great encourage this kind of effort, and to build a repository of
    comments pro and con on a face, saying how people like to use it, where they find
    it problematic, and so on. This would be enlightening to both graphic designers
    and types designers, I think. \r\n\r\nAh--just thought of a model: the reviews
    at Amazon.com. Here others can also rate how useful they find the review, which
    is nice also. "

    we already got that right here on typophile?\r\n\r\nNo, I would not say so. I'd
    say that this is a place where people usually discuss type in general. This includes
    currently just about every aspect but reviews. I don't think that Typophile holds
    discussions constantly about type and humor, technical specs, software and hardware,
    type fashion, teaching, new releases and just about everything under the sun EXCEPT
    reviews. I suspect there is a reason.\r\n\r\n\"Official\" reviews here might create
    a tension that would impede the Type Collaboration motto that fuels this hangout.
    This is somewhat of an Elysium for people in the industry, alongside other roles.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
    I enjoy type reviews a great bit when I find them. As a designer of fonts, I like
    to learn what people appreciate or despise in others' work. As a type fanboy,
    I like to read the history, trivia and bios and enjoy contemplating a talented
    critic's opinions. As a shopper, I would part with my money much more happily
    (read: more often) if I felt more informed beforehand. So there should be something
    offering this service.\r\n\r\nDuncan says he is looking for something like Pitchfork
    for type. I glanced at the home page and thought, \"yeah. That.\" I proposed the
    Typosium project because the solution he wants doesn't seem to exist yet. Could
    something else become that? Probably, but that doesnt mean it is now. I imagined
    content that is a type-oriented crossing of Consumer Reports and Spin magazines,
    and even refer to Typosium as a 'zine at times.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30882
    \">This thread</a> gives some background on the idea, and why it isn't doing what
    Typophile could probably do better. The <a href=\"http://typosium.org/deptofplanning/index.php?topic=2.0\">Manifesto</a>
    explains things best, as that actually got such luxuries as a drafts and revisions.
    Right now I am preparing for a major product release, and there are several questions
    on the table for anyone interested in developing Typosium more. My attention will
    return to it shortly."
