  Apple has a beta program for those intrepid enough to apply. The next OS, Leopard,

  recently upgraded to OS 10.4.6. Tad buggy and slow at first, but it seems to learn
  as it goes (and speeds up?). Can't tell if I really like it or if I made a huge
  mistake. \r\n\r\nGerald\r\n"

  body: Without trying to initiate a [[holy war]] for those involved in font production
    a dual boot Mac might well be the way to go - easy switching to FLab for Windows,
    or VOLT, or even proofing under Avalon, would equal better cross-platform fonts.

    which require a desktop computer to boot in Windows to be approved for purchase.
    \ This little diddy just skipped around that catch 22 and opens the choices. That
    is not to say that hordes will jump at the chance, it just says there is a choice.
    This is more a point for the UNIX research crowd than for the smaller design publishing
    market which Apple already has.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "The other thing this does, of course, is to enable Mac users to take advantage
    of the serious and considerable lead that the Windows versions of Office software
    have over the Mac versions, especially in terms of internationalisation and complex
    script support.\r\n\r\nI'll be interested to see what impact this has on companies
    that produce software for both Windows and Mac (including Microsoft). It may convince
    some to scale back their Mac-specific development. Why, after all, would you invest
    in two development teams when the product of one will work on both platforms?
    And then there are all those companies that have a niche market developing applications
    for the Mac, who will suddenly have competition from often larger and better funded
    companies making similar Windows software. I suspect the impact will depend on
    how seamlessly Bootcamp allows Windows apps to run within a general Mac environment.
    If developers for Windows apps start shipping them with Mac-like skin options,
    the competition will be even stiffer. It could be the death knell for a lot of
    Mac-specific software development."

  body: I just hope that someone from Microsoft's marketing department is paying attention
    (that is, if customer loyalty means anything to them). The specs on Apple's website
    state that the Windows XP OS you install must be a full-install disk and not an
    upgrade. Under this arrangement, one might presume that current windows users
    who want to take advantage of this opportunity would have to purchase a new license,
    whether or not they were eligible for an upgrade. Perhaps they should consider
    a special upgrade package that works like a new install to the Mac OS.
