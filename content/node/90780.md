    looking for a switch similar to the INSTCTRL[] for re-introducing x-direction
    deltas (cf end of <a href=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec12\">RTR

    didn&rsquo;t put one into the rasterizer at the time, and I&rsquo;m unaware of
    anybody else who might have done so since. If you&rsquo;re considering programming
    in native TrueType assembly language, you could use <code>GETINFO[]</code> to
    identify the rendering method and bracket instructions executed in x-direction
    by <code>IF[] &hellip; EIF[]</code> pairs. However, be aware that while this may
    solve spacing problems related to <a href=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec20\">RTR

  body: "<p>\r\nMost &ldquo;hinters&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve come across don&rsquo;t seem
    to understand the concept and power of size-independent instructions, nor CVT
    cut-ins or dual PVs for that matter, let alone the necessary preconditions for
    using <code>SDPVTL[R]</code>&mdash;testament of which I&rsquo;ve seen time and
    again while analyzing major failures of fonts rendered with early implementations
    of ClearType. &ldquo;A computer could never do this!&rdquo; was the mantra-esque
    &ldquo;explanation&rdquo; I was given when I tried to nudge &ldquo;hinting&rdquo;
    towards a ppem agnostic ansatz. &ldquo;We need these deltas to do it properly!&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;Hinting puts the &lsquo;Clear&rsquo; into &lsquo;ClearType!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    While today the latter seems more than a bit ironic to me, at the time this engineer
    on somebody else&rsquo;s payroll was happy to comply with the employee review
    goals and added 256 combinations of ClearType deltas to the GUI of VTT for everybody&rsquo;s
    exuberant indulgence in color fringes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhile prototyping
    an auto-hinter it dawned on me how intensely absent the notion of ppem independence
    was amongst professional &ldquo;hinters:&rdquo;\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>&ldquo;Spacing
    algorithm? Don&rsquo;t bother with it, most of the time this doesn&rsquo;t work,
    anyway.&rdquo; More deltas!</li>\r\n<li>&ldquo;Inheritance tree? Well&hellip;
    you could do 3 pixels here and 4 pixels there, but in <em>this</em> case it&rsquo;s
    too early to do 2 and 3.&rdquo; CVT deltas!!</li>\r\n<li>&ldquo;Composites? Just
    use fn nn to put the accent on top of the base character. What do you mean, &lsquo;center
    the umlaut&rsquo;?&rdquo; Composite deltas!!!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDeltas are completely
    useless in an auto-hinter. The auto-hinter doesn&rsquo;t go &ldquo;Hm&hellip;
    maybe I should &lsquo;pop&rsquo; this pixel here and that pixel there&rdquo; after
    it&rsquo;s done with a character. When you write an auto-hinter, the code has
    to get it right the first time around, in a ppem-independent way. Hence for the
    inheritance algorithm I gathered abundant anecdotal evidence until I saw a pattern,
    while for the composites I revisited the tenets of my PhD thesis and implemented
    a kludge. As to the spacing algorithm, I compromised it to the prevailing preferences
    and the anticipation that subsequent use of the font will require linear spacing
    (WYSIWYG and similar fixed layouts). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe world around me
    seemed comfortable with the ClearType quirks of <code>MDAP[]</code>, <code>MIAP[]</code>,
    <code>MDRP[]</code>, <code>MIRP[]</code>, and <code>ROUND[]</code>, along with
    a generous palette of deltas, but me and my auto-hinter weren&rsquo;t. While I
    can&rsquo;t tell you how I implemented the auto-hinter, I can give you the gist
    of what I did for many of the illustrations in the RTR (cf e.g. the table in <a
    href=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh6.htm#Sec10\">RTR 6.1.0</a>):\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use
    <code>SCFS[]</code> instead of <code>MDAP[]</code> or <code>MIAP[]</code></li>\r\n<li>Use
    <code>MSIRP[]</code> instead of <code>MDRP[]</code> or <code>MIRP[]</code></li>\r\n<li>Do
    my own math instead of <code>ROUND[]</code>, including CVT cut-in logic and minimum
    distance constraint</li>\r\n<li>Use a <code>SCANTYPE[]</code> snippet like <a
    href=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec12\">this</a> in my <code>prep</code>
    even though I&rsquo;m not using a single delta.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis
    does require some programming in native TrueType assembly language but lets me
    address a plurality of rendering methods with a single set of function calls,
    like so for a Calibri UC &lsquo;H:&rsquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CalibriH11pt96dpiAAX.png\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat
    may seem like many parameters is simply a way to switch out spacing algorithms
    or linking strategies. This permitted me to emulate the &ldquo;link tree&rdquo;
    of your example, with the left edge rounded to grid and the right edge rounded
    to sample&mdash;without &ldquo;re-hinting&rdquo; Calibri&mdash;simply by changing
    the respective function (notice that I didn&rsquo;t use a CVT for the LSB since
    I don&rsquo;t know the strategy behind your spacing algorithm). This produces
    a decent size ramp in B&amp;W with consistent stroke design contrast. Once the
    vertical stems are heavier than the horizontal crossbars, they stay heavier, with
    the ratio approximating the original design as closely as the coarse pixels allow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CalibriH6to48pt96dpiBW.png\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat
    same set of functions can implement different rounding &ldquo;granularities&rdquo;
    once it&rsquo;s rendered in gray-scaling, with progressively smoother transitions
    between stem and crossbar weights, along with a more gradual introduction of stroke
    design contrast. The rounding granularity is simply an implied parameter of some
    of the functions used in the process. Also notice the subtle introduction of the
    rounded stroke ends by around 30 pt on the middle row, and earlier on the bottom
    row.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CalibriH6to48pt96dpiAA2x.png\"><br>\r\n<img
    src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CalibriH6to48pt96dpiAA4x.png\"><br>\r\n<img
    src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CalibriH6to48pt96dpiAA8x.png\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPlain
    ClearType suffers because it doesn&rsquo;t anti-alias in y-direction, hence the
    crossbar weight &ldquo;jumps&rdquo; in increments of pixels, but at least it doesn&rsquo;t
    appear to have crossbars that are heavier than the stems. Likewise, it cannot
    render the rounded stroke ends until 127 pt or thereabouts, at which point it
    makes little sense to use ClearType in the first place. Like in your B&amp;W and
    gray-scaling examples both stems are left-aligned to pixel boundaries, while the
    stem weights are rounded to the nearest 1/6 of a pixel, compatible with ClearType&rsquo;s
    6&times; oversampling rate, and hence pairs of stems yield the exact same color
    fringes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CalibriH6to48pt96dpiCT.png\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nClearType
    with y-anti-aliasing improves on the aforementioned short-comings, with the rounded
    stroke ends coming in at 27 pt. This difference is due to the fact that the middle
    row of the gray-scaling examples uses 4&times; oversampling, compatible with Windows
    NT gray scaling and above, while y-anti-aliased ClearType uses 5&times; oversampling.
    In other words, y-anti-aliased ClearType uses slightly smaller samples and hence
    the rounded stroke ends can be &ldquo;turned on&rdquo; at a slightly smaller point
    size.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CalibriH6to48pt96dpiCTyAA.png\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFollowing
    your examples, below are 3 juxtapositions of TT source code and rendered output.
    Top to bottom:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>ClearType, y and x instructions on</li>\r\n<li>ClearType,
    y instructions on, x instructions and <code>IUP[X]</code> and <code>IUP[Y]</code>
    commented out</li>\r\n<li>Same as above except forcing integer ppem sizes in the
    <code>head</code> table</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CalibriH11pt96dpiCTX.png\"><br>\r\n<img
    src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CalibriH11pt96dpiCTNoXFractPpem.png\"><br>\r\n<img
    src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CalibriH11pt96dpiCTNoXIntPpem.png\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe
    difference between x instructions on and off is apparent. What may be less apparent
    is the effect of forcing integer ppem sizes in the <code>head</code> table. At
    11 pt and 96 dpi, the exact ppem size is 14 2/3. Forcing this to integer rounds
    this up to 15 ppem, with commensurate effects on height and width of the outlines.
    While the height is still hinted (and would be perfectly smooth without commenting
    out the <code>IUP[Y]</code>), without hinting the black body width further encroaches
    on the RSB space, which may not help spacing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGranted, most
    of the above TT related jargon may be outside the conceptual range of casual Typophile
    Forum visitors. At the same time, 256 combinations of ClearType deltas are all
    but ludicrous, even with a graphical user-interface. But overcoming this &ldquo;bazillion
    exception approach&rdquo; requires programming, whether you <code>MIRP</code>
    it or <code>MSIRP</code> it. Along the way you get to change the spacing algorithm
    or similar strategies without &ldquo;re-hinting&rdquo; the entire font. And your
    file size does not &ldquo;bloat&rdquo; n-fold. That&rsquo;s why I called it <a

    rendering is something new: 8x1 asymmetric greyscale rendering (8 shades of grey
    in the x direction, 1 (black) in the y direction) jumping to a 4x4 symmetric rendering
    for larger sizes, but unlike older greyscale rendering positioned on natural widths
    using subpixel positioning. I think in the y direction the new MS rendering will
    still be better than Mac in terms of readability, since it doesn't allow horizontals
    hairlines to lose contrast; but in the x direction greyscale on a subpixel spacing
    grid may be fuzzier than colour subpixel rendering on the same spacing grid in
    many situations.\r\n\r\nI confirmed this morning that DWrite specifically prevents
    hinting of advance widths. I'm not sure what this implications of this are for
    the Win8 rendering, but I suspect it isn't good in terms of whether we'd be able
    to hint to avoid the subpixel positioning. This suggests that in order to produce
    crisp and dark text under typical desktop/laptop resolutions in Metro, one would
    need to target specific sizes with outlines and metrics all fitted to full pixel
    edges, because even a small variance off the full pixel advance widths would have
    a knock on effect on the fuzziness of subsequent glyphs in a line (and, of course,
    even if you do keep to full pixel advance widths, you'll lose sharpness as soon
    as someone uses the font in the same line of text as a preceding different font
    without this (an issue we hit with subpixel rendering of an Arabic UI font recently)).\r\n\r\nOn
    mobile phones and tablets, for which the Metro UI is clearly targeted, these issues
    will be ameliorated but not removed by higher screen resolutions. There is also
    the possibility that this is a temporary situation, I suppose, particular to Windows
    8. The fact that the decision was made so late in the day -- after the developer
    preview -- suggests that maybe the Metro programmers felt they didn't have time
    to optimise either their code or the ClearType renderer to improve performance,
    and this is something they might be able to do for Windows 9."

    if there were a lot of negative feedback from the Consumer Preview, they might
    revisit it."

    rendering, eliminating color from any of it is, I think, reducing the volume of
