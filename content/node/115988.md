  body: "This seems very similar to Garamonds, but the S is really puzzling me. It
    has practically no serif on the lower terminal. This is what I have been searching
    for, with no luck so far.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Turns out this is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/poetica/?refby=bowfin|Adobe
    Poetica]], by Robert Slimbach. It has upright alternates that match this lettering,
    including the swash M and odd S.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks Mike for the find. I hadn't looked at Poetica for a long while. So
    I learn that the title is in Poetica small caps, with the M in the small cap swash.
    The combination is a hidden gem.\r\nDon"
