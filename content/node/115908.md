  typeface is too condensed, and has too small an x-height, to be Ionic No. 5, at
  least if Bitstream News 701 is a faithful clone thereof.\r\n\r\nAs well, I do not
  believe it to be Petit Mediaeval Clarendon; that was used by Cambridge University
  for some rather upscale Bibles.\r\n\r\nThese samples are from - and so, if you have
  the actual book, you may well find a note on the typeface in it - the St. Joseph
  New Catholic Edition of the Confraternity-Douay translation of the Holy Bible, published
  by the Catholic Book Publishing Co. of New York."

  body: "It somewhat resembles the old Linotype Antique No. 3, the bolder face shown
    below what they refer to as the \"De Vinne Series\" in this image:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8pt_dvs_an3_3551.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso,
    as somewhat similar, there is [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=clarendon+book+condensed&q=Go|Clarendon
    Book Condensed]].\r\n\r\nIt's definitely not Petit Medieval Clarendon, as that
    is wider.\r\n\r\nAnd there's also Manfred Klein's [[http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein04/text02/roundslab.htm|RoundSlab
    Serif]].\r\n\r\nBut notice that the face I'm trying to identify has <em>very</em>
    short descenders.\r\n\r\nAnd, from the old Lanston Monotype specimen, I've found
    something very close:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/76j_5058.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    style called 76J seems condensed enough, and has short enough descenders, to be
    a match. But I'm not 100% sure it is the right typeface, as I can't tell for certain
    it's a Clarendon. Also, the target face has one other unusual characteristic:
    the stroke width on the capital letters is noticeably thicker than on the small
    letters.\r\n\r\nOn further examination: 76J is a Clarendon, and it does have the
    other characteristic in 7, 8, and 12 point... but not 9 and 10 point. Since the
    book in question is in 8 point type, it's a match, I guess.\r\n\r\nBy name, it's
    Modern Antique Condensed."
