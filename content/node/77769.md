  body: "The big caps appear to be some version of the old typeface <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/benjamin-franklin/'
    target='_blank'>Ben Franklin</a> - but with the middle bar of the 'E' stretched.\r\n\r\nThe
    bottom line is Migraine Serif, an old freebie by Dasklem (Cl\xE9ment Nicolle).
    Copies can be found with a Web search."
