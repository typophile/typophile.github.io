body: This comes from the back patch of the Vietnam Vets motorcycle club. I was told
  the font is name &#34;San Francisco Western&#34; and is difficult to find. I&#39;ve
  contacted several embroidery companies with no luck. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m wondering
  if maybe the naming standard was misunderstood and it could possibly be something
  like &#34;SF Western&#34;. I&#39;m creating image button links for the webmaster
  of this club&#39;s website and would be grateful for any suggestions on where to
  look for this font or perhaps suggestions on another similar &#39;block and barbed&#34;
  type of font to use. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/52724.jpg"

    of fonts I&#39;ve already browsed looking for this!  <BR> <BR>I may just have
    to dig in and make my own. Thnaks for your help, Yves.
