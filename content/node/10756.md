  body: ' I just generate them in Unicode page mode, and set the codepage to MacOS
    Roman for Macs, and to MS Windows 1251 for PCs &#40;I use FontLab.&#41; In addition,
    I make sure to include both Mac and Windows in the list of supported codepages.
    These days I generate nothing but .otfs anyway. I also generally add the ten extra
    glyphs for Turkish support and add both Mac and Windows Turkish codepages. '
