  body: Hmmm, Eurostile regular seems thicker, more cubic and less sophisticated to
    me. Unless there is some &#34;light&#34; version I don&#39;t know about...

  body: Regarding the &#34;Hurray&#34;, I&#39;m stumped though... What &#34;Hurray&#34;?
    Where? How? When? Is it something I said, did or asked? You on drugs, Lettertiep?
    ;p

    about Belgium&#39;s NATO veto.  <BR>&#40;Always trying to stick some politics

  body: 'You may very well be right, Stephen. That&#39;s the brand new one, isn&#39;t
    it? There&#39;s an ad for Foundry Monoline in one of the latest issues of Eye
    magazine. I&#39;ll check it tonight and post a scan if necessary. <BR> <BR>Well,
    if I might add my two cents to Hrant&#39;s commentary: I think yesterday&#39;s
    front page of the New York Post Metro Edition was <i>INCREDIBLY</i> rude, a shameless
    and utter misappropriation of historical facts. This is a perfect example of how
    history can be grossly misused in an argument. Anyone wanting to react to this
    comment is invited to e-mail me personally. I&#39;m almost sorry I brought this
    up in this thread, but I&#39;m very offended &#40;although I&#39;m not French&#41;.'

    stuff in <i>Eye</i> for several months after release. <BR> <BR>Hrant, FontLab.

  body: Hm... Must have missed that one. Then again, I&#39;m generally not so aware
    of Foundry types as I&#39;m not such a fan of Quay&#39;s, but that&#39;s probably
    because I got brainwashed by Neville. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    the thread, hence the &#34;post a scan&#34; remark <i>after</i> you posted your
    sample, Stephen.

    disgusting, and it has <i>nothing</i> to do with the situation at hand.
