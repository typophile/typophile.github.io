  up their logo (but only slightly). The client is a financial advisor company, so
  their logo shouldn't be too wacky. This is what I came up with:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_concept_6283.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nDo
  you think it looks ok? What could be improved? Any ideas? Thanks!"

  body: The horizontal bar in the F is too high I guess. Also am not sure about that
    disjoint in the H. The central horizontal bar seems too thick in F and E. E is
    too wide compare to the others. I would also reduce the stroke contrast a bit.

  body: "Hey satya,\r\n\r\nThanks for commenting on my logo. My initial post was a
    bit silly though (I realised that just now). \r\n\r\nI decided to change my strategy
    and go for a more conservative logo type. Maybe it's best if you take a look at
    the entire website which can be found [[http://hfe.designbits.de|here]] (currently
    only works in Safari or Firefox).\r\n\r\nBy the way, is there a sub-forum here
    where I might ask for a website critique?\r\n\r\nI really like the quality of
    the feedback on this message board, but mostly do web design, not logo design
    :-(\r\n\r\nAny idea where to get good feedback?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

  body: "This is a strong base for your concept.  Maybe try to have the right hand
    vertical of the H also be the vertical of the F, since you separated the right
    hand vertical of the H already.  Then try to repeat this somehow with the E...\r\n\r\n---\r\nNick

  body: I would take a different tact. if that is a registered mark Just use a strong
    typeface and use various ways to express the mark. Make it a cut-out, a piece
    of glass, metal, but always with the same setting and spacing. The "logo" visually
    isn't memorable.
