  I on the right track?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen_3636.png]\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "There is one more trick \u2026 especially when working on a low contrast
    typeface, it may save a lot of time.\r\n\r\nStart with an upright typeface\r\n\u2013
    reduce the weight of the horizontal strokes by approx 10%. Unless you already
    have made a high contrast or a thinner version, you\u2019ll have to do this manually.
    When you already created one of such variations, Multiple Master (or whatever
    it is called in the program you\u2019re working with), combined with different
    interpolation values for x and y will be of great help.\r\n\u2013 scale the typeface
    in horizontal direction by approx 96%. Depends a little on the angle, colour and
    the width of the italic you have in mind. Has to be balanced against the reduction
    of horizontal weight as well.\r\nDo several rough tests with different reductions
    of weight and amount of scaling with some key characters to get the right color.
    Especially with sans serifs this is very critical.\r\n\u2013 slant the typeface
    at a rational angle. Doing so, the bcp\u2019s become easier to handle & the rational
    angle makes shure that they will never create bumps in the transitions from straight
    to curve when they are short.\r\nGo here http://issuu.com/fontfont/docs/ff_din_round
    and check page 20\u201321. Don\u2019t bother about the typeface in question having
    round stroke endings. The mathematics described go for all italics and for all
    transitions from straight lines to curves.\r\n\r\nNow take a close look on what
    Briem suggests. I\u2019ve never tried to combine his suggestions with my procedure,
    but I think that when you follow his suggestions after getting the weight right
    using my procedure, you\u2019ll be heading for a perfect italic!"

  body: "William \u2014\r\nNo I had no clue, I'm still very new to type-design, thank
    you for showing me such a goldmine!\r\n\r\nAlbert \u2014\r\nThanks for going into
    such detail, I think this sounds like a very sound method, it will mean I'll have
    to scrap the work I've already done, but that doesn't matter. At the risk of sounding
    incredibly na\xEFve, I didn't realise how much mathematics went into type-design.\r\n\r\nNick
    \u2014\r\nYes totally have heard of (and love) Univers, Frutiger was only 8 years
    older than me when he designed it (a sword that's hanging over my head). I have
    been looking at the designs of other neo-grotesques, such as Atlas and Neue Haas,
    but I was interested in process, just to gain a better understanding.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your comments guys, such heavyweights commenting on my thread.. going off
    to bed a little starstruck... :)\r\n\r\nSeb"
