body: "I have until recently used Ben Kiel's 'Font Generator Version 1.1' script to
  generate OTFs. After I changed the shape of my serifs (they are components placed
  in the relevant glyphs) the merging of contours have started to fail in some places.
  If I do the procedure manually, the result is the same as with the script. I have
  tried to optimise the paths, set pathdirections, cut and paste from working glyphs
  to bad ones, re-draw sections, set new start points, but to no avail. Sometimes
  a left side serif is missing, sometimes the stems and serif parts get entangled
  after merging instead of merging. What to do?\r\n\r\n/Claus"

  body: Make sure each segment of the glyph has counter clockwise contour for OTF.
    If not, cut the good segments, reverse the contour of the bad ones, then paste
    the good ones again. That works for me.

    just (yet another) Fontlab bug.

  body: "FL's not good at this if the contours intersect twice. Sometimes, if there
    are lots of contours, it only understands one pair of contours merging at a time.
    And, sometimes, until you correct the direction for each path separately it won't
    merge. Finally, when not even this works, I copy the parts into the mask, rip
    'em apart and put them together manually. \r\n\r\nWhen we want to annoy them,
    let's all ask for \"Create Overlap\". \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

    with other things than adding features to Fontlab 5.\r\n\r\nWhat is especially
    annoying is that is worked one moment, then I changed some components a bit and
    now it doesn't. It's not even more than two shapes overlapping each other at any
    one time, and the shapes are surely not complex in any way. And if Typophile would
    let me insert an image I could show you. Alas."

  body: Whenever a glyph is behaving oddly, in other words, whatever I'm try to do
    with it doesn't seem to work, I select the entire glyph, cut it and then paste
    it. Somehow, moving a glyph to the clipboard and back seems to sort things out.
    I don't know if this will help in your case, but it might.

  body: Thanks for the tip Mark, but that didn't help. A related bug that just popped
    up, is that if I copy two overlapping boxes from one glyph to another they are
    merged into one with some of the points missing! God dammit.

  body: ">Yuri et al seems busy...\r\nI was not kidding obviously enough. Creating
    overlaps makes removing overlaps seem like fun. \r\n\r\n>God dammit.\r\nIndeed,
    I ran into one of these a couple of years ago, everything right and no reason
    for mis-merge. I documented it for them but I'm sure it's not on any list.  \r\n\r\nAnd
    whatever you do with components, do not move the origin line or else. \r\n\r\nI
    also recommend what Mark said about copying and pasting the glyph, but every once
    in a while I need to do this to the whole font to stop some cascading bug. It's
    like FL has lost proper offset to some table and only a new font fixes it. \r\n\r\n>if
    I copy two overlapping boxes from one glyph to another they are merged into one
    with some of the points missing!\r\n\r\nThis is, I think, a setting 'cause it
    does not happen to me. \r\n\r\nSorry it sounds like voodoo, as opposed to computer
    science, but... well you know. :-o\r\n\r\nCheers!"
