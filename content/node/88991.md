  essay that was published in Typographica, Issue 4. \r\n\r\nI know these are very
  rare. \r\nDoes anyone have a copy or know if there is a digital version?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    old BTW?) but only the articles that really\r\ninterested me. What was that one
    about? When I have time I\r\ncan look in my \"deep archives\" (dusty boxes in

    of Typographica would be the archives of <a href='http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/'>The
    Department of Typography & Graphic Communication</a> and of course, <a href='http://stbride.org/'>St.
    Bride Library</a>. Both in London rather than Manchester."
