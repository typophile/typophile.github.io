  Photoshop,\r\nOffice, Quark etc.\r\n\r\nI've also tried all of the \"automated\"
  online font ID services with\r\nno luck (some are good at asking the right questions
  but then suggest\r\nfonts that don't match my answers, anyhow).\r\n\r\nAlso browsed
  many online fonts and foundries.\r\n\r\nITC Ronda is definitely not it though it's
  about as close as I could \r\nget.\r\n\r\nSome of the key features are the single
  storey \"a\" and the no-spur \"r\".\r\n\r\nImage below and thanks in advance for
  any help. I know this font came\r\nfrom somewhere because I'm no font founder :).\r\n\r\nCheers.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3_5355.gif]"

  body: Have you considered the possibility that it's custom drawn, using a bauhaus
    or a geometric font as a starting point? That r doesn't look familiar to me.

    you designed this logo? How long ago?"

  body: 'I suspect there are characters from three different fonts tacked together,
    and maybe the r altered. You can tell because the e is so much wider than the
    o and the a, and the r of yet another character. '

  body: "I seem to remember seeing a font like that in smaal book written in Spanish.
    My daughter was a 1st grader at the time and about 80% of the kids in her school
    were immigrants from Central and South America. My daughter was trying to help
    some of her classmates with English and they, in turn, were helping her with Spanish.
    The books were school level simple with big type that looked much like that. Perhaps
    you might check some Spanish sources?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    body: Most definately a custom treated font, just a bold gothic font customized.

  body: "Thanks for all the insightful comments!\r\n\r\nThe text was put together
    by an outside designer some time ago and I was trying to track down the font unsuccessfully.
    It makes sense that I failed because it's a mix of several fonts - I hadn't noticed
    how the e is larger than the o as one poster above points out. I thought this
    \"font\" was nice - maybe someone should create one like this? :)"

    body: The Geometric 706 + custom "r" mentioned by a poster above looks like a
      direct hit to me.
