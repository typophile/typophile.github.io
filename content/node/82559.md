  Anderson did it, but the real question is what typefaces were used?\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n"

  body: You're definitely right about Futura and Hellenic Wide, I don't think the
    condensed san serif if Univers 49. The 'R' is very different.

  body: Yeah, it could be any number of condensed grotesks. Akdzidenz, Heroic, Tungsten,
    etc.

  body: "My vote is MVB Solano Gothic.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/solano-gothic-mvb/\r\n\r\nIt
    has plenty of weights and the G, R, S all look right.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Seb nailed it, it looks like Heroic Condensed, the M, G, J, S, and numerals
    all match.\r\nThe poster is really nice, but I'm surprised Kelli didn't catch
    the really blatant kerning issue between A and Y in THURSDAY and FRIDAY."
