  body: That makes two of us ;)  I tried taking the caps and searched what-the-font
    ... with no luck.  I've looked through fancy scripts, no luck.  I thought for
    sure it would be a piece of cake here.

  body: "Well well well, look what you found indeed. Well done!\r\n\r\nThat is a rather
    interesting font. I'm a bit disappointed by their choice for the lower case 's'
    and 'v' though. They feel too big and too much like the capital version. "

  body: "I think what you may have here is a custom (or personal) font. \r\n\r\nWhat
    does this image come from? If it's a game, then this is probably a font custom
    designed for the game, and we can look all year and not find it.\r\n\r\nIf you
    are open to things with a similar feeling (sort of), consider [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atskjald/|Skjald]].\r\n\r\n\r\n-

    my Guide, but I never looked at many of their other styles.\r\n\r\nSo much for
