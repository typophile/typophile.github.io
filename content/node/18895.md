body: I absolutely love the custom handlettering style from the early 60s (think <a
  href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=150&subpage=viewfontsinuse">Ed
  Interlock</a> type of stuff) and I'd love to make a font like that of my own.. In
  fact, I already am making one at the moment. I found this lovely looking custom
  type on a movie poster from the early 60s that I'm basing my font on but I'm curious
  about the legalities of it, and what's considered fair and legal when you're inspired
  by something. The poster in question certainly didn't contain a full alphabet, so
  the vast majority of the letters/font is completely original work, just in the same
  style. That makes me think I'd be okay considering basically all of the most well-known
  fonts from history are basically copies of typography from antique books, and many
  type designers out there seem to base many of their designs on old lettering found
  in books and whatnot..

  body: thanks for the link! that's a very good article, definitely helps (especially
    with the definitions bit). out of those I'd say my design falls into the homage
    category. a few of the characters are (at the moment) basically the same as they
    appear on the poster, but most of them are completely new in the same style, particularly
    the masses of ligatures i'm making. so homage seems to fit best.

    opinion.\r\nThe main crux seems to be if you draw it yourself from scratch and
    draw your own outlines. That does not mean a complete new design.  There are a
    zillion Caslon and Garamond inspired faces out there. People look at specimen
    books and make ther own drawings legally.  The big thing is the use of the name.
    \ If someone has trademarked or copyrighted the name (don't ask me which term
    is correct) then you can't use the name without permission. An example is, you
    cannot put out a face called \"Ed Interlock\" even if it looks nothing like the
    original. \r\nI recall that Christian Schwartz did a face based on lettering he
    saw on industrial buildings in Pittsburgh. It sounds like your project falls in
    that arena.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
