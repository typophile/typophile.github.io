  body: If it&#39;s for text, I think you&#39;re out of luck. If it&#39;s for a logo
    or title or such &#40;one instance&#41;, you could use the variety of weights
    to build your own.

  body: Frutiger Next is Linotype&#39;s revision of the original digital Frutiger.
    They&#39;ve been re-working some of the classics like Syntax, Sabon, and Optima.
    One big difference is that Frutiger Next has a real italic and not just a sloped
    roman. <BR> <BR>I thought Myriad Pro had small caps, too.

  body: Nope. <BR> <BR>We had thought about doing them, but the schedule didn&#39;t
    permit it. In fact, I remember Christopher Slye and I talking about putting in
    a bunch of extra hours and making them in our spare time. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>

    please consider italics for the Condensed version. ;-&#41;

  body: The best Frutiger I know is still Frutiger. The Next version is really bad.
    Not the case of forthcoming Avenir Next, who is really better than Avenir. <BR>
    <BR>Why? Just because between the twos, the Linotype Type director is not the
    same guy. The second one know is jobe and have certain talent. <BR> <BR>Myriad
    is a good alternative, but sometime &#34;too soft&#34; for certain kind of use.

  body: 'Myriad Pro, alas, has no caps. Giacomo still doesn&#39;t, as far as I know,
    either. Although different in style, The Sans from Luc&#40;as&#41; de Groot might
    be an alternative here. '

  body: you could fake myriad small caps by generating an appropriate weight from
    the MM version..

  body: Today, sound more easy to use Blend fonts in FontLab than use a MM. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    true Small caps are not simply a Blending thing. Ok, more for Serifs faces than
    Sans where the difference is less considerable between a blend fake SC and true
    ones.

  body: Smallcaps are like special glasses for different types of wine. Mostly only
    wine freaks will care. <BR> <BR>There are so few instances of actual smallcaps
    use &#34;on the street&#34; &#40;even when the font chosen has them right under
    their noses!&#41; that certainly using a darker &#40;but also wider and looser&#41;
    instance from an MM source is 95% adequate. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I still can&#39;t believe that Adrian has yet to draw a condensed italic after
    all these years.  I would have thought his namesake type face would have the full
    gamut of variations like his Univers. <BR> <BR>Chris

  body: As a side note, I&#39;ve used the semibold weight in Myriad Pro as small caps
    for the regular weight, a touch narrow, but very close in weight at the default
    70% reduction in InDesign. It matched up nicely with figures set in proportional
    old style. Not a great solution for a lot of text, but adequate for corporate
    identify projects.

  body: I have used Myriad&#39;s condensed italic when I needed it with Frutiger.  Some
    how, to me at least, Myriad doesn&#39;t come up to the quality of Frutiger though;
    it might be a limitation of the early multiple master fonts or it just might be
    my astigmatism :-&#41;

    much appreciated. OSF with no small caps is an odd paring to my eyes. maybe in
    a Gold Edition, omnipresent fonts re-release... ;&#41;'
