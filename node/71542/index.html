  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey, I've been searching high and low for a step by step guide to truetype hinting in Fontlab but the best I've found is how to autohint.
So I've gotten this far:
1. Convert curves to truetype
2. Paths > Set TT Direction
3. Convert Hints to links
   That IS the right process, right?
From there, is there a logical order to go through? Align, then single links, then double links, etc?
   I think what I might really be looking for is a description of How the tools work rather than what they do. For instance, when I link one side of a line to the other side is that meant to line the pixels up between the link, the way hints work? It doesn't always seem to work that way
   I assume the align tool is supposed to align a point on the contour with its corresponding point on the... other contour, but it's pretty unpredictable as to which point its going to gravitate toward. Seems to move away from the point I'm clicking on as often as it aligns to it. I wonder if I'm using it incorrectly.

   Not sure at all what to do about rounding and when to pick which method.

I keep finding sentences like this in the manual that are referring to a "another command," but can't find what that "other" command is: 
"The single link connects an outline point to a point whose position is set by another command. If you set a single link that linked point will always be at the given distance from the base point:" 
Oh, the base point the first point, right?

   In the manual's instructions on how to use double links it essentially says not to use them because they're unpredictable. OK. Why do they exist?

   If I can get some answers on these questions I'll compile it into an article. I keep seeing people online who are completely miffed at the process and need simpler instructions(I may be the most clueless of them) so I'll post it here or the Fontlab forum.

Thanks for any help that comes swooping in.</div>

Understanding TT instructions for hinting, starts I think, with knowing that it's based on a stack and a graphics state (both of which are poorly documented, I think). This you should also understand, that before either your stack of hand made or auto hints begins to act when the OS calls for a font of some ppm size, that the TT OS software has 'hinted' the em top and bottom, located the baseline in pixel space, as well as the origin and the set width of each glyph (undocumented). Then one has to understand that no point moves properly unless its movement is relative to another point (documented nowhere I've read). Then the instructions you or the auto-hinter make, start from the origin point and work into the glyph's points, using the origin as a basis for the rounding of one (or more) of the points on the glyph, from which the instructions further down the stack round the other points.

It would be so cool if the folks who were flogging this auto-hinting process would show one proof that it is useful for more than "sloppy work" but I'm not holding your breath. I think, in case you can't tell, that knowing "what they do" is pretty important if you want to know "how the tools work." 

Cheers!

		<div class="commentbody">David, in FLS autohinting is a two-step process. First, it analyses outline and generates type 1 hints, then it converts type 1 hints into "visual instructions" which you can see and edit in TT hinting mode. In between is a step of generation and optimization of font-level hints (zones and stems). 

Last and final step is conversion of "visual instructions" into native TT hinting code. All intermediate steps are visible and very simple to check.</div>

"Then the instructions... start from the origin point and work into the glyph's points"
am I right in thinking that while manually hinting you might be better off if you take into account a path across the glyph starting at--say 0,0--rather than jumping around?

Yuri: that's one of the things I cant figure out - I get my type 1 hinting tweaked just right, then convert them to instructions and end up with a mess somehow. I wonder if my problem starts in that in-between step. I've been using the auto-generated stem values carried over from the type 1 hinting - especially in the font I'm working on right now, which is hollow

It's incredible how hard it is to get a couple pixels to line up correctly.

That's why it can be controlled in TrueType (OT-TTF) using the [gasp] table.</div>

Well, what I was doing was not paying any attention to the linear order of problems I was attempting to fix, so I was jumping back and forth across the glyph, sort of like playing Whack-a-mole. But, in comparing what the autohinting is doing to my own instructions I may be even more wrong in my approach - I've been linking 2 points, then in a completely disconnected operation linking two others. On the other hand, the generated instructions always seem to have the links working in back to back operations so that one begins where the last ended.

Yuri: Never noticed the "[gasp]" in that menu title... thought you were being sarcastic :)
I just happened to find the setting by mistake in the TT Hinting Options General tab and messed with it to see what would happen.

This is definitely an uphill battle, so much to learn.</div>

Thought maybe I'd get an answer to that by searching for some commonality between the links in glyphs that have been autohinted, but it all just looks like a toddler scribbled thin blue lines over it. No apparent pattern.</div>

The instruction stack begins with reference to the origin point 0,0, as this is rounded by the font software before the hints begin. Then the instructions are an orderly march across the glyph, and/or an orderly march up from 0 to the top of the glyph and down from 0 to any descent. 

If your reference points and march are not orderly, and the stack is just running around moving points in no pattern, then stop it!
