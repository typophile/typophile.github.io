  is :\r\n\r\n1. Measure the inside distance of the \"H\".\r\n2. Half the number and
  place it on each side the \"H\".\r\n3. Place 4 \"H\"'s next to each other to check
  the spacing.\r\n4. The space on the inside and outside of the glyphs should be balanced,
  adjust spacing until the balance is correct.\r\n5. When they are balanced I half
  the sidebearing to give me the correct sidebearing for the \"H\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/H_3921.gif]"

    just a series of capitals that you are working with?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArtur"

    still then even 157 is to loose. If a sidebearing of 157 gives you the same space
    between H's as within the H, there's also the horizontal bar within the H which
    to compensate for by slightly reducing the space between the H's. And from what
    I can see in your example 157 indeed seems a bit to loose.\r\n\r\nI think the
    last step in Tracey's method should be interpreted as:\r\nMeasure the new space
    between H's (so after optically adjusting the space between H's), divide that
    by 2 and you have your new sidebearing.\r\n\r\nWhen I imagine Tracey shuffling
    around with H's on white sheets and a ruler, this seems like a logic interpretation
    of his method.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArtur"

  body: Keep in mind that Tracey is describing how to space a serif text font, not
    a sans serif. And that the next step in his method, spacing the H and the O together,
    will bring new adjustments.

  body: "Reginald, Tracy says that half the width of the counter is the starting point
    for each sidebearing. He goes on to say that: 1. it generally has to be less to
    be balanced; and 2. generally with sans designs the side bearing of the has to
    be still less because of the lack of serifs.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't think
    you can tell what is 'balanced' the first time around just by looking at the H's.
    I think you will have to do a few other letters--including the O--and then look
    at them in words. It is really not obvious, and only with experience can you get
    a feel for what is a 'good' H spacing from that one letter--and even then there
    is not one 'right' solution. The other thing to do to gain a feel for what is
    'good' is to look at the sidebearings in designs similar to yours that you like.
    There you will see a variety of treatments and their impact on text \"color\".
    For example, compare Helvetica and Univers. Also you have to consider intended
    default size, as that will affect what is best."

    single character. \r\nThe H is fit correctly when the D has balanced spacing in
    these combinations, HDH and ODO.\r\nI know that's cryptic, to some, but if you
    read carefully, that is what is written.\r\n\r\nCheers! "

    and none of them are likely to be terribly wrong. \r\nThe only other tip I have
    is if the \"it\" you are trying to space is the same shape as something else,
    give it the same space. \r\nIf it is different, how does that effect the space.
    Have a constant mental argument with yourself, and you'll see that help your spacing,
    (not to mention it being good practice for 'discussing' spacing with others).\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n "
