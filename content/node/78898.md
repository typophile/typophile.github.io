  other news programs, that bad fonts/ugly fonts are more memorable.\r\n\r\nAll school
  book commonly use Times, Georgia, and other serif font, they are good font. Are
  bad fonts can improve studying quality for student?\r\n\r\n\r\n>??\r\n\r\nThanks,

    it was about them making the information itself more memorable.

  body: "On this topic, given the theory that if students have to work a little to
    read their textbooks, then they will spend more time on their words, and, lingering
    there, remember them better...\r\n\r\nIf someone, who understands only English,
    or some other language written with the Latin script, looks on a book written
    in Chinese or in the Ethiopic script or some other writing system which looks
    exotic from that perspective...\r\n\r\nthere is the possibility of entertaining
    the fancy that such a book contains within it profound secrets and mysteries.
    Rather than simply being an ordinary book like all the other ordinary books.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    therefore, I have toyed with the idea (one could go to the Korean writing system
    for inspiration) of devising an alternate representation for the English language,
    which could be learned with less difficulty than learning either another language
    or a large repertoire of symbols (such as Blisssymbols) for making English-language
    texts look profound and mysterious.\r\n\r\nApplications might include text in
    backgrounds in comic strips - i.e. text on an alien monolith could contain hidden
    jokes, because it's \"really\" in English instead of in the alien language it
    purports to be. Think of the Interlac alphabet used in the Legion of Super-Heroes
    comic..."

  body: It creates better soundbites. "Yellowstone's gunna blow" makes a better-selling
    headline than "Yellowstone's gunna blow in ten thousand years".

  body: "I saw that one. The news story noted that, hey, it could happen sometime
    in the next million years. And so people wondered why the headline. But if one
    looked into the real details, there was a reason to think there was some real
    chance of it happening soon - of course, if it didn't, than it might happen instead
    quite far in the future.\r\n\r\nSo the news story was garbled; the scientist involved
    had noted a real issue, and he wasn't the one sensationalizing.\r\n\r\nAlso, there
    are several fonts of the general kind alluded to above [[http://www.blambot.com/fonts_symbol.shtml|here]],
    a site I discovered thanks to the use of their fonts for the [[http://www.hello-cthulhu.com/|Hello
    Cthulhu]] webcomic."

  body: "The study I remember reading concluded that information presented in harder-to-read
    fonts was easier to remember.\r\n\r\nBut the information presented in each font
    was brief. The time it took to read the control (Arial) versus the time it took
    to read the \"disfluent\" sample (i.e. italicized, slightly smaller, Comic Sans
    or suchlike), for someone who was already a reader, couldn't have diverged by
    more than a fraction of a second.\r\n\r\nWhat they measured was not \"disfluency,\"
    it was <em>emphasis</em>. As designers, we know that type in black-on-white 14pt
    Arial with not much space around it says (to paraphrase Stefan Sagmeister) \"I
    am going to bore the shit out of you.\" Pretty much anything else, <em>italicized</em>,
    with proportionally more space around it, <em>in comparison</em> says \"read me
    and pay attention.\""

  body: "I think that we can at least hope that this particular research will not
    lead, say, to a revival of Fraktur for selected passages in school textbooks.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason, though, unfortunately, will be that schoolteachers and school administrators
    will recognize that the chief problem is not to get the children to read their
    textbooks more slowly, to absorb the information therein... but rather to get
    them to look at them <em>at all</em>. Hence, this is a technique only applicable
    if one has a disciplined and motivated student population.\r\n\r\nAnd, given that
    those students who have \"Tiger Mothers\" might not have English as a first language,
    there are even <em>other</em> issues that might have to be considered. Disfluent
    text could be considered discriminatory, after all."
