  colours sell in specific reference to magazine covers?\r\n\r\nI've always been told
  green is a poor selling colour and dark covers generally perform worse than light.
  Can anyone offer up anything more concrete??\r\n\r\nThanks"

    target=\"new\">GD (Graphic Design) USA/May 2006</a> which is their Annual Color
    Forecast issue.\r\n\r\nHere are just a few trends/forecasts by color marketers:\r\n-
    Palettes that reflect substance, an anchor\r\n- Multiple monochromatic colors
    used together\r\n- More emothional response to color; uplifiting, not shocking\r\n-
    Rejection of bold patterns\r\n- Texture as more important than patterns\r\n- Design
    that is moving away from perfection toward the need for human touch\r\n- Artisan-inspired
    design and true color, as opposed to digital color.\r\n\r\nI would think the color
    palette for a magazine would depend chiefly on the target market and the main
    focus of the publication."
