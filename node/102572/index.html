  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>Name&rsquo;s Ash. A couple of friends and I have been working together for the past 2 years and so far have been using this logo. We wanted some professional input and would really appreciate your constructive criticism. This logo came about when one of my friends younger cousin drew up a sketched logo and we inked it in photoshop. From looking at the other logo critiques on this forum I can tell your feedback can be very beneficial.</p>
<p>Background about the group:
Three 23 year old African American women who met at the University of Florida while majoring in Mass Communications.</p>
<p>Types of Videos we do:
Advertisements, Weddings, Short Films, Events, Documentaries. We love it all. Most of our videos so far have been targeted towards the African American Community.</p>
<p>Let me know if you need anymore info!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Ash, welcome to Typophile.</p>
<p>My first thought is to wonder whether it&rsquo;s appropriate to have &ldquo;Films&rdquo; in the name and to show an image of film, since film is on the way out and you&rsquo;re shooting video.</p>
<p>Regarding the logo itself, it&rsquo;s unconventional and amateurish (sorry), but there&rsquo;s something about it that makes me smile; a sense of joy and maybe whimsy. I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s good or not; a lot would depend on how you&rsquo;re marketing yourself. If you want to look a bit unconventional and different and are doing mostly smaller projects, maybe an unconventional logo would work fine. But if you&rsquo;re trying to get corporate work, you might want something more conventional and professional.</p>
<p>If you want to keep the same general look that you&rsquo;re showing, I&rsquo;d try using solid areas of color (or color gradients) rather than doing everything in outline, and I&rsquo;d have a graphic designer redraw it to clean it up. I&rsquo;d probably try to make the woman in the center the focal point, by perhaps making her a tad larger and making the highest part of the film strip in the center rather than on the left. I&rsquo;d also make the title larger; maybe one word above the image and one below. Regarding the font, I&rsquo;ll let others who are more expert in that area make suggestions.</p>
<p>By the way, there&rsquo;s nothing about it that makes me think &ldquo;African American&rdquo;. I only mention that because you mentioned it in your post, and I&rsquo;m not sure if you want your logo to communicate that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">That is a thought. I think we just liked the way it sounded together. And no offense taken we are trying to take a step towards the professional world one thing at a time. We are looking to go corporate eventually and I can tell simple and to the point logos are the way to go. We don&rsquo;t have to keep the same look because I Feel like we are still working on our brand! =)</div>

<p>Okay, and in fact most companies change or update their logos periodically.</p>
<p>Maybe some folks here will have suggestions for new logo directions, but my suggestion would be to team up with a good graphic designer who can meet with you, learn about your business, your future goals, your competition, and then he/she can develop a new logo for you. If money is tight maybe you could do a trade and swap some video work for developing a new logo.</p>
<p>I see you&rsquo;re in the Tampa area and I&rsquo;m sure there are numerous good designers in that area. (You could also work with an out-of-town designer via phone and email, but I&rsquo;ve always felt I could size up people better when I meet them in person.) Look at their portfolios (especially logos), talk to them, get names of some recent clients you can contact for references, get a written estimate, etc.</p>

<p>You got some good stuff to work with. You&rsquo;re African Americans, there&rsquo;s 3 of you and from what I can gather from the illustration Emarjay Films is a celebration.</p>
<p>Perhaps a strong monogram of M.R.J. could work but I&rsquo;d would explore all options. Just be sure that whatever you develop that it&rsquo;s strong &hellip;and that there is a proper visual hierarchy.</p>
