body: So I'm taking over our Yearbook next year here at Newbury Park High School.
  I know it's early, but I'm working on mockups for next year because I'm reorganizing
  the whole thing. Currently we have a theme and each editor for each section applies
  that theme in their own method. This year it's digitized. I know. TERRIBLE. So next
  year, we're having a standard design. My co-editor Shanti and I have basic layouts
  done, but we're looking for the perfect fonts. We're a school, so we don't have
  a large budget for fonts. We need a title font (or as many as you want to name)
  and a body font. What has kept us stuck is pairing the two. Any ideas? Much Love,
  Christoph & Shanti!

    sure if you're using \"theme\" to mean a visual look, or something more in the
    editorial/philosophical sense. But if you're concerned that the sections will
    look unrelated, one way to add some visual harmony is to create a selection of
    fonts and colors, and then ask each editor to pick and choose what they want from
    those groups. Each editor retains some creative freedom and can lay out the pages
    in their section as they wish, but the common elements add some overall harmony."

  body: "Museo does look really good. She was wary about it as a body font because
    we have to go a little small for captions, but I just saw Museo Sans. PERFECT!!!
    Thank you, Nick.\r\n\r\nJames, I'll have to remember that. That sounds really
    good actually as not seeming so \"this is how it is\" and authoritarian and stuff.
    Thank you as well, Mr. M."

    of choices it doesn't seem as constraining to them. \r\n\r\nJust be sure that
    the choices go together reasonably well; for example choose a palette of colors
    that work together well rather than a bunch of random colors. (That's something
    your art teacher could help you with if you're not knowledeable about color theory.)\r\n\r\nAnother
    approach that's even looser is to specify one font family and 1 color (maybe a
    school color) that each editor must use somewhere on their pages, but they are
    free to also add any other fonts or colors. The result would be less harmonious
    than my previous suggestion, but would create a least a little bit of relationship
    between sections."
