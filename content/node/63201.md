body: In Fontlab, I tried to assign a keyboard shortcut to "Align to Points", but
  it doesn't work, even after a restart. It still saves and all, but pressing the
  key combinations after I have selected two points does nothing. Help?

    this week I discovered that I cannot remove the default shortcuts for sketch mode.
    Nor can you do anything with the undocumented shortcuts in the metrics window.
    Some of this stuff appears to be hard-coded, so just work around it and file a
    bug report."
