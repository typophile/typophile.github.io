  had originally specified Scala Sans as a complimentary sans serif, but the client
  is unwilling to pay for a site license.  <BR> <BR>Can anyone recommend a decent
  free sans serif font? Otherwise they&#39;re going to use Arial and I&#39;m going
  to hang myself. <BR> <BR>Thanks. '

    let them hang &#42;themselves&#42; with Arial... <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: Very nice Stephen. Much better than Arial. <BR> <BR>Aren&#39;t there a few
    other faces out there that, like <BR>Arial, come bundled on mac &amp; pc for free?
    <BR>Trebuchet,  Andale Mono, Verdana, Adobe Sans? <BR> <BR>Does anybody more info
    on Adobe Sans? I don&#39;t <BR>know a whole lot about it, but apparently it&#39;s
    the <BR>multiple master font that shows up in PDFs when <BR>a given font is not
    properly embedded. <BR> <BR>Best of luck Christopher. <BR> <BR>P.S. - We saw your
    poster at the AIGA SF poster show. <BR>Very nice. Sorry I didn&#39;t get to meet
    you in person.

    Regular. <BR> <BR>Do you think it could be used so massively and still be free?
    I suspect they might have an &#34;end-user-only&#34; clause in there or something.
    Dunno. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    <BR>Next time I go down to the Edinburgh Castle I should post and see what typophiles
    show up...  <BR> <BR>Interface seems like a good contender, thanks. <BR> <BR>By

  body: Sure. <BR> <BR>The event was called Within 4 Walls. AIGA SF invited about
    40-50 Designers to create posters for the event, under the theme &#34;how does
    the street influence design?&#34; Naturally the theme was widely and loosely interpreted
    &#40;including my own humble submission which effectively answered the question
    in reverse&#41;. <BR> <BR>The poster was hand silk-screened in a signed and numbered
    edition of one. <BR> <BR>Now that you&#39;ve seen it you can probably figure out
    which t-shirt submissions are mine as well. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/2813.jpg"
