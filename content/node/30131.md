body: which was the first type to be digiatlly reproduced? Did teh Digital Age begin
  after the invention of the Apple Mac in 1970's or the 1930's to 40's after  Atanasoff-Berry
  Computer and ENIAC? So when do you think typeography was involved in digital screen
  based, output products. i know about anti allaising etc.

  body: "The first digital typesetter, the Digiset, was created by the Dr.-Ing Rudolf
    Hell GmbH company in Kiel/Germany in the late 1960s\u2026 either 1966 or 1968.
    The first digital typefaces were the ones that were designed for this machine,
    by Gerard Unger and Hermann Zapf, among others.\r\n\r\nSo digital typography began
    in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It really took off in the 1980s with the introduction
    of technologies that are now more common, like the PostScript page markup language
    by Adobe, the Macintosch computer by Apple, and Fontographer by Altsys (later
    by Macromedia, now by FontLab Ltd.). These inventions led to the design of fonts
    on personal computers, for use on other personal computers."

    1977 onwards, but they weren't Macintoshes."

  body: "Digital type, or digital machines to produce type. The later was in the mid
    to late 1970s. Early Compugraphic and similar systems used some kind of photographic
    process to expose film. However digital fonts were available before 1985 and PostScript.\r\n\r\nIf
    you mean digital equipment, then the 1960s information from Dan is the right track."

  body: "When applied to typography, digital really means that the fonts contain the
    shape of the letters not in analogue form (a piece of metal, or a photographic
    image), but numerically. And by implication, with an electronic computer.\r\n\r\nIn
    that sense, the crucial invention is PostScript, in the early 1980s, a programming
    language invented by Adobe, which was able to digitize complex letter shapes by
    describing letter outlines with vector paths.\r\n\r\nEarlier technologies had
    digitized part of the typographic process at some stage or other. For instance,
    the Monotype (early 20th century) transferred keyboarded text to the casting machine
    on punched paper tape. This technique was still used with phototype in the 1960s,
    before the paper tape was replaced by computer tape.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure
    how all the photo imagesetters of the 1960s and 1970s worked. I know that Diatronic
    exposed directly from a negative image (on a ground glass plate); but what about
    the Alphatype and similar video systems -- AFAIK, they worked by exposing single
    glyph images, displayed on the entire surface of a CRT screen. But were the images
    on the screen generated entirely from digital information?"

    on a numerical basis would be the Romain du roi, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nThe first
    system with electronically stored shapes was probably Digiset, which was introduced
    in 1965."

    was the desktop output that caused the boom. By removing the step of getting type
    set as galleys and pasted up, you saved countless hours and many dollars. You
    also brought the infinitely editable layout to be born allowing clients to rewrite
    anyting any time without the high cost of alterations in the old paste-up days.
    You also spawned the cottage indudtry of typeseeting at home.  Ikurus was a very
    capable tool, but it could not do pagemakeup on the fly like the old Mac SE.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    but wasn't the system chiefly used for typeface development?\r\n\r\nThe first
    CRT digital imagesetters were available late 1970s and were using vector-based
    outline data for fonts, and were used for straight high-resolution typesetting.\r\n\r\nDon't
    confuse PostScript with digital fonts. There were several PDL (Page Description
    Language) formats being utilized prior to the development of PostScript. The main
    breakthrough with PDL/PostScript was that imagesetters could now manipulate and
    output BOTH type and images simultaneously and composed into a page layout.\r\n\r\nNo
    more paste-ups for graphic artists!!!!"

  body: "One major advantage of Desktop Publishing was the concept of WYSIWYG -- being
    able to see a scaled representation of one's layout on screen, and modify it interactively
    prior to printout.\r\nAt first it was high-contrast B&W, type with jaggies, but
    then anti-aliasing arrived with TrueType and Adobe Type Manager, c.1988. When
    layout programs Pagemaker and Quark XPress introduced the zoom tool, that was
    huge too.\r\n\r\nAlso, I recall it was nice to get a large greyscale monitor.
    For a couple of years I worked on a black-and-white Mac Plus, and sh*t would happen
    like getting dropshadows (cool new digital effect!) on top of the type rather
    than behind, because it all looked the same on screen. So I'd bluff and say \"yeah,
    dropshadow at top left, pushing the design envelope...\""
