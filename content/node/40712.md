  body: "thanks Florian, yes it does seem to be some version of Binner but the 'S'
    is very different, i thought maybe it was some sort of Binner narrow or condensed
    but i cant find it in that form anywhere.....does it even exist in condensed???
    are there any other fonts that are similar to Binner that it would be worth checking???\r\nthanks
    for posting!!!\r\nneill"

  body: How old is this cover? It's likely that this is a pre-digital typeface.

    sent this by a client, looks like its off a penguin book from the 70's.....\r\ni
    reckon hand drawn is a distinct possibility........oh well.\r\nthanks for having
    a look at it!\r\n"
