  body: The third one already came up (maybe a couple of times). I don't remember
    if it was IDed and am unable to find the thread(s). Maybe you can search the forum
    for Blender and/or Gridnick, which aren't a match but were often cited as alternatives.

  body: "Another alternative would be my [[http://justanotherfoundry.com/Mashine|Mashine]].
    \r\n\r\nMost of the letter shapes are very similar, or at least there are corresponding
    alternate characters included. It is slightly more extended, though. This is the
    result of different approaches of how to deal with the 45 degrees diagonals in
    the M and N: They naturally lead to a rather wide M and N, so I adjusted the overall
    width to match, whereas in the above example, the M and N have a rather quirky
    solution, and W and V had to be \"chopped off\" but that allows the whole font
    to have a more conventinal overall width."
