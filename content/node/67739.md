body: "I've run into a bit of a feature-ordering dilemma, where two features can't
  be consistently ordered to produce the desired results. I'd thought of a rather
  ad-hoc hack to solve this, but was wondering whether this might potentially cause
  problems.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd thought of doing was something along the lines of the
  following, where a 'dummy' feature is declared simply as a placeholder for a lookup:\r\n\r\n<code>
  feature QRXC { # dummy feature\r\n\r\n\_\_\_lookup X {\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_# do X\r\n\_\_\_}
  X;\r\n\r\n} QRXC;\r\n\r\nfeature ss01 {\r\n\_\_\_# do Y\r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\nfeature
  ss02 {\r\n\r\n\_\_\_lookup X;\r\n\_\_# do Z\r\n\r\n} ss02; </code>\r\n\r\nThis would
  force the relevant lookups to be ordered such that feature 'ss02' would be able
  to do some stuff both before and after feature 'ss01' is applied. Feature 'QRXC'
  presumably would never be activated on its own since 'QRXC' isn't a registered feature
  and presumably therefore no application will be aware of it.\r\n\r\nHas anyone ever
  made use of this approach? Are there potential problems which might arise from using
  'dummy' features (apart from the obvious problem that someone might someday register
  such a feature)?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: Why not use a tool like VOLT that allows you to order lookups independently
    of features? This is how the GSUB and GPOS table architecture is actually arranged,
    so tools that force you to order features discreetly are putting a limitation
    on OpenType fonts that are not part of the format.

  body: "I'm on a Mac, so VOLT isn't really an option (I tried to get it to run once
    under Darwine (a Mac version of wine), but without success). I'm aware that I
    can do this if I compile my features directly under the most recent AFDKO, but
    I'm more comfortable working within FontLab. As I said, the solution above is
    a cheap hack -- it works, but it results in a superfluous feature hanging around
    inside the font.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Having thought some more about this, I'm now finding myself tempted to create
    a dummy feature at the beginning of my feature list, and then declaring every
    single lookup used by the font within that lookup. This would overcome FontLab's
    limitation of tying lookup ordering to feature ordering.\r\n\r\nLooking over the
    opentype feature registry, it would appear that all registered features have names
    in lowercase. Does anyone know if this is an official naming convention? If so,
    then assigning my dummy feature an all-caps name would avoid the possibility of
    future conflicts arising.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
