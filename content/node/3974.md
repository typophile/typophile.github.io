  body: Kepler is solid &#40;and it pairs great with Meridien and Vendome&#41;, especially
    if you get the opticals. Think about Warnock too - Slimbach&#39;s best design
    [so far]. Mrs Eaves is fine for larger point sizes, but only if you either use
    InDesign&#39;s &#34;optical spacing&#34; or if you respace the whole thing yourself.

  body: not to hijack a thread but... <BR> <BR>is there a way to take the type that
    has been properly spaced in indesign and paste it somehow into illustrator without
    losing the proper spacing? <BR> <BR>maybe a dumb question - i&#39;m asking anyways!
    <BR> <BR>by the way i have been working with eaves a lot lately and it indeed
    does have some spacing problems...but it also has charm.... <BR> <BR>-shawn

  body: Illustrator CS has the same optical kerning engine as InDesign, as well as
    the same spacing and justification capabilities. As long as you have the latest
    Illustrator, you should be able to duplicate the text layout pretty well. <BR>
    <BR>As for Kepler, it&#39;s probably Slimbach&#39;s most underrated/overlooked
    work. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;d invest in the MM version at this point in
    time &#40;Adobe has stopped selling its MMs, and is encouraging its licensees
    to do the same&#41;. Get the OpenType version. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Oh, resellers still sell MM fonts?! Wow, that&#39;s the best news so far this
    year! <BR> <BR>I think laymen might indeed need to avoid MM fonts, but somebody
    like Hector who can create custom instances from the MM at will should definitely
    get the MM version, especially if he can easily add any OT features with the new
    FontLab. Not to mention that InDesign can automatically produce optically-correct
    typesetting with an MM font &#40;that has an optical axis&#41; but not with an
    OT font &#40;yet&#41;. And even when InDesign support&#39;s OT&#39;s optical masters,
    it will be a discrete affair &#40;so to speak&#41;, instead of the fully continuous
    scaling in an MM. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    I would say with buyinh this face, is that I rarely have a proper chance to use

    packages have just gone from $129 to $139. I expect that this is merely a coincidence
    and Fontshop will promptly clarify that the relevant prices are those in effect
    when their offer was made &amp; accepted. <BR>

  body: <i>&#34;I was just about to ask for the Quadraat Sans package...&#34;</i>
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;d say, ask for the package you wanted &#40;Scala, Quadraat, ...?&#41;
    anyway. I will, once I&#39;ve decided &#40;wish I had PDF samples to look at...&#41;.
    <BR> <BR><i>&#34;This is not a clean game...&#34;</i> <BR> <BR>That&#39;s why
    I think that must be merely an oversight. If it&#39;s <i>really</i> &#39;not a
    clean game&#39;, they would be saving perhaps $2-$4 per person - maybe a few hundred
    dollars altogether - but the damage to their reputation, among people who mostly
    spend other people&#39;s money buying type, would surely cost them that within
    a few days. Never mind being dishonest; it just wouldn&#39;t make business sense.

  body: 'Well, assuming hypothetically that there&#39;s something &#34;devious&#34;
    going on: <BR>1&#41; Some people did this because the fonts would be totally free.
    There&#39;s a qualitative difference between free and $10, so some of these people
    will simply end up not claiming the &#34;prize&#34;. One problem with this is
    that they&#39;re really not losing much by giving the fonts away - the eventual
    indirect impact on sales would probably be negligible. <BR>2&#41; The people doing
    this are generally not the type to buy fonts anyway. Kyle notwithstanding.  :-&#41;
    This means the people being pissed off are no use to them anyway. <BR>3&#41; If
    you make enough noise in public &#40;like on Typophile&#41; you can be sure the
    policy will be changed. <BR> <BR>But maybe it was just some oversight? <BR> <BR>hhp
