body: "Ayo,\r\n\r\nI have a conscript (constructed script) I have been working on
  for over a decade. Recently been trying to build a \"vector generation\" system.
  The best I can come up with so far is a \"symbol per word font generator\".. basically
  every word has to be entered (one glyph for sit, one for sat, one for sitting)\r\n\r\nI
  have exhausted most avenues, and the best idea, besides a \"per-word-font\" is a
  custom generation system, but this is a huge project. is there any typography software,
  or anything at all, that could help \"jump start me\" or even do this. I have search
  extensively and found nothing.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple example of how it works,
  i realize the flexibility is way beyond standard font software. but is there maybe
  something that could work, even if it doesn't use the full abilities of Dscript,
  and half way there would be good enough at this point.\r\n\r\nor is there something
  opensource that might be a good starting point to build such a system?\r\n\r\n<img

  example and explanation]]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what the \"per word font\"
  system generates now\r\n<img src=http://dscript.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/crow_pitcher_story.gif>\r\n[[http://dscript.org/story/crow_pitcher_story_big.gif|full
  size pic]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other option is to restrict the \"flexibility\" out and
  revert back to a \"single straight string\" like it was back in the beginning of
  the scripts evolution, (like the free online [[http://dscript.ca/genpage.php|Dscript
  generator]]) Here is an example of what it generates.\r\n<img src=http://dscript.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/dscript_generator.gif>\r\n\r\nBut
  I really want to find something that will allow for more flexible connection and
  2d placement. any suggestions?\r\n"
