    <strong>can</strong> think of a reason why this was done. Of the fonts likely
    to be handy - and, naturally, scientific and technical types will consider the
    choice of the ideal typeface to be a secondary consideration - Comic Sans has
    an appearance which might suggest <em>handprinting in chalk on a blackboard</em>,
    thus setting the right emotional tone for what is a relatively informal presentation.\r\n\r\nObviously,
    a more appropriate font will need to be made available to forestall a repetition
    of this <em>faux pas</em>. There are science and math types who dig type - think
    of Donald Knuth's <em>Computer Modern</em> - so I think we'll see something appropriate
    added to the selection of TrueType fonts included in Linux distributions in the
    next little while without a need for action by the typographic community.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, there may have <strong>already</strong> been the ideal font for this purpose
    available as a free font, but \"handy\" trumps \"free\" for busy people.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nA
    brief search on Dafont suggests that the \u0153uvre of [[http://www.kimberlygeswein.com/|Kimberly
    Geswein]] might be likely to include something helpful in this regard. \"Set Fire
    to the Rain\", for example, might have worked. Or \"Architect's Daughter\". Or
    \"Shadow of the Day\"."

    does not follow from the latter; printers as well as physicists can \"talk shop\"
    either formally or informally. As this was a very preliminary presentation of
    results that weren't polished, but instead rushed to the public eye due to the
    significance of the discovery, I would think that the presentation was at least
    perceived during its planning as \"informal\" in some senses of the term.\r\n\r\nWith
    members of the Press present, on the other hand, a certain level of formality
    is indeed inevitable."

    the Universe, how does it follow from that premise that it is not worthwhile to
    work so that we understand more rather than less?\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing to

    write.\r\n\r\nOf course, new physics doesn't seem to be required for new <em>technology</em>,
    which is more of an engineering matter. But our current feats of engineering do
    rest on scientific discoveries, even if they are relatively old ones like electromagnetism
    for the most part.\r\n\r\nIt's true that science has made wars deadlier, and while
    the \"green revolution\" may have saved a billion lives, science can't make it
    possible to follow our instincts and increase the size of our population exponentially
    forever.\r\n\r\nBut science should be valued because of what it <em>can</em> do:
    it gives us the power of having more and better choices. It can't make sure that
    we will make the right choices, or that <em>other people</em> will make the right
    choices, but that is no reason to throw it away."

    I am not fond of political correctness, even though I believe in equality: what
    political correctness ends up doing is giving the legitimate concern for equal
    rights a bad rep.\r\n\r\nThis created some confusion in another recent thread,
    where my noting that Papyrus was popular, and simulation faces unpopular, due
    to the present climate was interpreted by one poster as a denunciation of simulation
    fonts <strong>on my part</strong>... in which I manfully strove to resist rising
    to the bait.\r\n\r\nAccents can be an impediment to communication, even where
    it would be unproductive to complain about them. And, for that matter, it isn't
    bigotry for employers to insist that employees have the ability to use correct
    spelling and grammar when writing, where external communications are part of the
    job, even if this is a barrier to people for whom English (or whatever other language
    is local) is a second language. As long as reasonable allowances are made, and
    qualifications of this nature are not sought when not required, as an artificial
    means of exclusion, there should not be a problem with employers seeking what
    they require.\r\n\r\nOne could, legitimately, criticize English spelling, like
    Chinese characters, as an artificial barrier to social mobility - but a project
    of language reform is something one has to expect to be difficult to either initiate

    that isn''t in itself exciting, typically through media manipulation, public relations,
    advertising etc. So whatever else a bunch of physicists in a lecture hall using
    Powerpoint to explain their discoveries to other physicists is, it doesn''t seem
    to me hype. As to whether the thing itself is exciting, that seems to me to depend
    entirely on individual interest. Higgs and his colleagues theorised that in order
    for the standard model to remain viable there must be a field that gives mass
    to the particles that go through it, and on the basis of that theory predicted
    that a boson particle with specific properties would be found if one looked in
    a particular place. That''s really good science: theory leading to prediction
    leading to experiment. And the announcement this summer is that yes, a boson was
    found exactly where predicted by Higgs and his colleagues, and now physicists
    need to determine its properties. Now, I happen to think this is exciting, and
    would have found an announcement of failure to find the boson exciting too, because
    either result has major implications for what remains our ''least incomplete''
    understanding of the physical universe. The fact that, after the experiment, the
    standard model is still looking pretty good, despite known problems with some
    aspects of it, is exciting to me because I find it exciting that human beings,
    through intelligence and ingenuity and mutual effort, have come to understand
    so much of the nature of physical reality. If that doesn''t excite you, that''s
    fine too: I don''t think anyone is obligated to be excited by things that don''t
    interest them. If you think its a waste of money, that''s a legitimate concern,
    and there definitely is a debate to be had about the funding of the increasingly
    costly experiments at the fore edge of particle physics. I don''t think one needs
    to denigrate the results of those experiments or characterise their publication
    as ''hype'' in order to have that debate. I am interested in and excited by the
    latest CERN results <em>and</em> think the cost might be more than we should pay.
    On the other hand, as with footballer salaries, there is no guarantee that the
    money saved by not funding CERN would go to better or more worthy endeavours if
    not spent in that way.'

    where the SSC would be put, almost all Congressional support for it outside the
    state in which it would be located would evaporate.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, this sort
    of thing doesn't happen - when you vote for an MP, you're choosing which national
    party to put in power, not to elect someone who has free rein to represent exclusively
    local interests."

  body: Comic Sans was very likely the only informal face that many Windows users
    had, so it got pressed into use for anything and everything informal. Well, that's
    the best reason I can think of for the highbrows wanting to call down the WAAAGH!!!
    on it.
