  and beyond the typical tourist hot-spots that people here have found interesting.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nK."

    line (Nr.1, colour: yellow). The stations have got unique hand painted name shields.
    I see them everyday as i'm using this line day by day ;)\r\n\r\nIf anything more
    comes into my mind i'll let you know. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nP\xE9ter\r\n"

  body: "Egan, szeretlek!\r\n\r\nThanks for the info. I will have a good tour guide
    (he grew up there) but much of the trip will be old friends and anything involving
    alcohol. So I thought I'd get some outside opinions about other things to do ;)
    \r\n\r\nHrant: Prague is out of the question. Me significant other is Hungarian,
    so I will be quite tied to Budapest, at least for this trip! Maybe the next time
    round.\r\n\r\nTypical: Thanks I'll take a closer look at those links. \r\n\r\nPeter:
    I'm wondering about the thermal baths. Are they worth a visit? Is Budapest rather
    uninteresting for typography, or just not a well-known destination? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nK."

  body: "At the second-hand bookshops ask for the books designed by <a href=\"http://www.bestwebbuys.com/Tibor_Szanto-author.html?isrc=b-compare-author\">Tibor
    Sz\xE1nt\xF3</a>, the great Hungarian typographer--printed in the 1960s and 1970s;
    the better ones were published by Helikon Kiad\xF3 and Eur\xF3pa K\xF6nyvkiad\xF3.
    Some of them are truly superb.\r\n\r\nTake a trip to Gyoma, the home of the <a
    href=\"http://www.gyomaikner.hu/eng/muzeum_2.html\">Kner family</a>. The Kners
    owned a printshop there, and made themselves a name in the world of private press
    printing with their exquisite little books, very tastefully typeset, illustrated
    and decorated. The shop was still active in the 1970s; I remember how impressed
    I was by the quality of its presswork, binding, and the fact that some books manufactured
    at Kner Nyomda were printed on a special, watermarked stock, which used to be
    produced in small quantities for those limited editions.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://w2.mome.hu\">Moholy-Nagy
    M\u0171v\xE9szeti Egyetem</a> (Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design, formerly
    known as Magyar Iparm\u0171v\xE9szeti F\u0151iskola) could be worth a trip. It
    used to be a pretty good school for graphic and typographic design. Many excellent
    Hungarian design professionals are MIF graduates, and some teach there. \r\n\r\nFor
    additional information on Hungarian typography see a very good listing offered
    by <a href=\"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/hungary.html\">Luc Devroye</a>. "

    is in DC, I reckon. Hope it's better in  <a href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/hourbyhour/HUXX0002?begHour=14&begDay=190#Tue,%20Jul%2010">Budapest</a>.
    Have you ever been there?
