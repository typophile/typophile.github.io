  know:\r\n\r\nI am curious about some prints from a book \"Masterpieces from the
  Art Galleries of the World\".  Published by The NY Art Engraving Company.\r\n\r\nThey
  are prints made from engravings made from paintings in art galleries. I was wondering
  how they were made into such nice engravings. Was a photo made into an engraving,
  or did some talented person sketch them? Examples can be seen here:\r\nhttp://www.fontplay.com/freephotos/illustrations.htm"

    it is possible to create engravings in a photographic way I am guessing that these
    are the result of the engraver\u2019s art. The link is to a partial essay on the
    subject.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n<em>Edit: having looked at the Butterfly Chase it does
    look like a photographic process has been used</em>"

  body: "Some of them are hand done - but the majority on the website are photographic
    - by 1873 photolithography was invented and pushing wood engraving and steel engraving
    out- see Horgan's Half-Tone and Photomechanical Processes by Stephen H. Horgan,
    published by the Inland Printer Company in Chicago, 1913 for a complete account
    of some of the early techniques - some producing better images than we can today.
    \r\n\r\nSome of the more linear ones could be wood engravings - but even they
    often put the artists sketch on the block photographically - "

    is the same type of process they call photolithography, used for making integrated
    circuits.\r\n\r\nThanks for the info!"

  body: Actually I have an artist friend who made prints by having his drawings transfered
    photographically to printed circuit board blanks and then inked and printed them
    like a relief print (block print/letterpress). He also showed the boards themselves
    as works of art. Photolithography is the basis of most printing done today - all
    magazines, newspapers and books are printed that way. If you are interested in
    print media identification a contemporary book of interest is "How to Identify
    Prints" by Bamber Gascoigne, Thames & Hudson, NY, 1988. It includes basic descriptions
    of the processes.

    a pretty remarkable film. Allowed just about anyone anywhere to take a photo.
    \"Press the button and we do the rest.\" Photos could be made into engravings.
    Even more amazing. Fellow named Walker put this to good use in introducing the
    world to typefaces from the incunabula period (he actually went into libraries
    and photographed those old books). Wow. This inspired a fellow named Morris to
    engage in what was to become the typographic revival of the twentieth century.
    Amazingly, Jenson, Baskerville, Garamond, Manutius, etc., were discovered.\r\n\r\nWhat
    the hell do they teach graphic designers in art school?\r\n\r\nGerald"
