body: "For starters, I am not a graphic designer or artist. I've come to this forum
  to get assistance from those of you who enjoy doing this type of thing. I'm getting
  a tattoo this weekend, but need someone to draw it up for me. I tried using GIMP2.6
  (which my friend suggested), but could not, for the life of me, figure out how to
  accomplish what I wanted. It may as well have been in Hebrew. I also tried installing
  \"Illustrator\" and \"Photoshop\" (to no avail). I'm just not talented at all when
  it comes to this type of thing. I'm looking to get a tattoo of a triquetra using
  this verse (And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of
  these is love. I Cor 13:13). The verse itself will be in the form of the triquetra.
  I don't know how to twist/turn/shape text into a desired shape. If any of you could
  help me with this, I'd GREATLY appreciate it. I'd like the font to be Lucinda Handwriting.
  And the image itself can be no smaller than 3\"x3\" and no larger than 4\"x4\" (though
  I'm sure the size can probably be scaled up or down when printing---so I've been
  told). Thank you in advance for all who decide to help me out. By the way, I don't
  need the circle in the triquetra (just the triquetra itself). Feel free to email
  me your design at dreinva@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nAnd now abideth faith, hope, love, these
  three; but the greatest of these is love.\r\nAnd now abideth faith, hope, love,
  these three; but the greatest of these is love. I Cor 13:13\r\nAnd now abideth faith,
  hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. I Corinthians 13:13\r\n(whichever
  length works best)\r\nLucinda Handwriting (if it's no more work to switch fonts,
  I'd also like to see it in Minya Nouvelle)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the guy who's doing
  my tattoo is fairly new and only hand draws his tats. This tat has to be done with
  a program for it to come out right (as the letters have to be SPOT ON). That is
  the reason I'm asking for assistance from you guys."

  body: 'hrant: I''m not sure how much this design will cost. I had gotten a quote
    of $200 for a more detailed tat (pair of stake pierced hands). I''m sure this
    one will be a little less (as it''s not as detailed--just letters). Can you, or
    do you know of anyone who can help me with this? I tried and tried to figure it
    out using that GIMP2.6 program and also Microsoft Word. I just CAN NOT figure
    out how to shape text.'

    who has specific examples of text tattoos in their portfolio. Letterforms are
    very hard to tattoo properly and if you're going to have it for the rest of your
    life, it might as well be well done.\r\n\r\nThat said, go talk to a couple of
    artists and ask them about size, the amount of text, the design and placement."

  body: "I agree with hrant and jselig\u2026put some money down if you want someone
    from here to design it for you. Do you ask your tattoo artist to just throw down
    a tattoo for you without purchasing it? We eat, too. :)\r\n\r\nI also suggest
    you go to an artist who knows what they are doing with letterforms. Do you really
    want a shitty tattoo for the rest of your life? If he is doing it in his garage
    or kitchen \u2026 well that's even worst. Best of luck dude!"

    the triquetra for another time with a more-experience tattoo artist."

    as you can see from my image above you have some interesting design challenges
    ahead of you. \r\n\r\nThe above comments are very critical, compare my sarcastic
    image (using comic sans) with hrant's linkage and keep in mind the above comments.
    Each letter shape is an expression in and of itself and if everything goes according
    to plan, all those letter shape expressions should be a integral kick ass component
    of the entire design. \r\n\r\nI think this piece could be really awesome but it
    will take some time in the planning stages.\r\n\r\nGood luck, hope that helps."

  body: "You might consider adding a background behind the type. Create a triquetra
    that looks like a 3d object, similar to the one below, and put the type on it,
    sort of like it was engraved on a bracelet. Space the words so that the hidden
    areas are between two words, so that no characters are hidden.\r\n\r\nIn the example
    below the bands are obviously way too thin, there's not room for the type, but
    take that general shape and make the bands much wider so the type will fit in
    them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shape_4800.jpeg]"

  body: For all of those who gave insightful, helpful responses, thank you for your
    time and help. I eventually posted my request in an "Illustrator" forum. From
    there, I rec'd a video on how to go about doing what I was attempting Instead
    of trying something simple my first time using Illustrator, I had to go tackle
    something pretty complicated. It took me a little while, playing with the font
    (different fonts and sizes) to finally get what I was looking for. My first two
    fonts, the tattoo artist said wouldn't work, because of eventual "bleeding" together.
    This week though, I found 2 fonts that were the right size and spacing that would
    work. Hoping to get my tat this weekend. Thanks again for all that helped me.
    Will post a pic once I get it done.

    size?\r\n\r\nLooking forward the pic.\r\n\r\nLast week I got a killer tattoo comish.
    It's a ribbon of text telling the guy's life story. The text begins on top of
    his left foot and wraps and weaves and moves up and around his whole body pausing
    / incorporating for his many other tattoos (one of which is mine!) He's a hip
    hop artist and will be coming up with the verses, I'm so stoked to get this piece
    going.\r\n\r\nWhat I really fond intriguing about your piece is not so much the
    design challenges - they can be the fun part - but the fact that you've laid christian
    verse on what was/is originally a pagan symbol ... "
