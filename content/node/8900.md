  body: The price would depend on the complexity of your emboss. Call your local dependable
    printer for a quote. <BR> <BR>As far as the process goes, your film will be out
    put to film, if it is not direct to plate that is, in the appropriate color separations
    plus an additional separation for your emboss. If you are doing a two color job
    think of the emboss as a third plate, or color. <BR> <BR>Once this extra piece
    of film is output your printer will either make the emboss themselves or will
    send it to some magical place where they make such things.  <BR> <BR>Usually it
    is made of some sort of metal though I have seen some polymer ones. <BR> <BR>After
    you file is printed it will be pressed against this piece of metal and there you
    have an embossed piece. <BR> <BR>Multilevel embosses cost more. <BR> <BR>Get me
    out of this nut shell. <BR> <BR>-smc
