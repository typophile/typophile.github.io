  font used in the \"Bullting Birmingham\" logo at the top left here:\r\nhttp://www.bullring.co.uk/website/\r\n\r\nIt
  looks a bit like Din, which is the font they use elsewhere, but it's more geometric
  and angled.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    It's very similar to Gridnik.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't know where you can
    buy Foundry Gridnik. I tried google and found nothing, have you tried emailing
    <a href=\"http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/\">The Foundry?</a>"
