body: "Hello, guys!\r\nI\u2019m totally new here and English isn\u2019t my 1st language,
  so I apologize in advance for any mistakes I may incur about typography or with
  my writing.\r\nI\u2019m here because I want some help on choosing a typeface that
  is similar to Garamond, but with less contrast between thin and thick strokes in
  upper case letters, id est, with thin strokes \u201Cless thin\u201D. I mean, I love
  Garamond, I think it confers some classic flavor to the text, especially when the
  texts I want to print are Latin classic poems with side translation. But the thinness
  of the horizontal bar in the H, E and T, or in the legs of M, N, V and A, bothers
  me, perhaps because I have got a less than perfect vision, also I find it aesthetically
  unattractive. \r\nSo do you know some typeface which looks like Garamond in size
  and style, but with less contrast in the upper case letters? Something that could
  join the capitals from Georgia, Palatino or Bookman Old with the lower case from
  Garamond (best of the possible worlds)?\r\nBy the way, if it can be a non-copyrighted
  font (freely downloadable) so much the better.\r\n"
