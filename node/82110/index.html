  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been wondering about the following: It used to be recommended to use Postscript T1 for print production (rather than truetype, I guess?). Would you use TT for print production, and if not, why?</p>
<p>With the dawn of opentype I don&rsquo;t know if this is still valid. There still is postscript (PST1) and truetype (TT) but now there is Open Type TTF and OTF as well. Opentype, as I understand it, is basically an enhanced truetype format, with either postscript or truetype outlines.</p>
<p>But does that mean that OTF (postscript outlines) is still better suited for print production than TTF (truetype outlines)? What relevent differences are there, both in print as on screen?</p>
<p>THX Jeffrey</p>

<p><cite>Would you use TT for print production </cite></p>
<p>Anytime. 
I don&rsquo;t see much reason to recommend PS over TT anymore, especially not the old plattform-dependend PS Type 1!</p>
<p><cite>What relevent differences are there, both in print as on screen?</cite></p>
<p>For printing it doesn&rsquo;t matter. On screen TrueType/OpenType TT might offer better hinting, but only if the font is equipped with it. It also depends heavily on the render methods. Which OS? Which kind of subpixel rendering? Typophile.com has countless of threads on these subjects.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m not a webdesigner screenhinting is not as important to me as printing quality. I have some older PST1 fonts that are quite badly hinted (I use Mac OSX, 1024x768 screen), like ITC Mendoza, which show all kinds of strangle line deformations, especially in the horizontal strokes. This might be slightly annoying when working on a document on screen, but as long as I know the printing quality is good, this is a minor quibble.</p>

<p>As you indicate, what you say goes by the premise that quadratic beziers were derived by converting cubic beziers, which does not say anything about formats as such. Working with quadratic beziers right away you can get away with just as few points.</p>
<p>Queneau &ndash; <cite>ITC Mendoza</cite></p>
<p>Issues are font-specific, not format-specific. (Referring to a very old version: As to outlines, some extra points are caused by conversion from IK to bezier curves. As to hinting, a few letters seem to have oddly placed hints. Both shouldn&rsquo;t matter in print, though.) Still one of my favorite typefaces.</p>

<p>The simple answer to your ultimate question (&ldquo;does that mean that OTF (postscript outlines) is still better suited for print production than TTF (truetype outlines)&quot;) is: No. OTF fonts are PostScript outlines in a TrueType wrapper. Apple is now a Designer Label for consumer electronics, not a professional designer&rsquo;s platform. Get used to it&hellip;</p>

<p>No: no doubt coming from years of disinformation propagated by Adobe, who did not want their monopoly on desktop publishing fonts challenged, even if their original solution was less than elegant (I cannot tell you how many times, when I was working in a print shop, we had to contact customers to get either the printer or screen fonts that they neglected to send with their jobs).

<p>I still have many postscript fonts and they work fine for me, it&rsquo;s just a bit more work. It seems that with the opentype format fonts come with a lot more bells and whistles, which can be understood in a competitive market. But this is not a guarantee for quality. It is certainly easier to implement a lot of these features, but i&rsquo;ve seen many commercial OT fonts that have poorly designed weights, bad diacritics, poor spacing and kerning.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">My wife and my father both work on new windows computers. In my experience they are slow, complicated in it&rsquo;s file handling and structure. I&rsquo;ve worked on windows before I switched to mac, and I find mac&rsquo;s so much easier to handle, much more user friendly, better interface, less likely to clutter up, less susceptible to viruses, etc. It&rsquo;s a personal judgement, but to me, Windows is not an alternative.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting. The last time I saw a TrueType font stall a RIP was in the mid-1990s, however the experience was bad enough to prejudice me against the format for some time. The job crashed the RIP so badly, we lost hours of valuable production time, and it reinforced the (then-widespread) company policy to specify PostScript Type 1 fonts only in client-supplied work, whether they were application files, postscript or .pdf files. In my subsequent teaching practice I would recommend PostScript Type 1 as a more reliable font format overall, until as late as 2004 (I even had a classroom diagram like Janek&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>With the arrival of better RIP technologies, .pdf workflows in pre-press and OpenType (both varieties) this distinction for print purposes has become irrelevant, although I think most font developers now prefer the hinting offered by the TrueType flavour of OpenType for onscreen display. Certainly this is what I understand from reading the literature of companies like Dalton Maag.</p>

<p>Migration from my old computer was a snap&ndash;literally. I copied a small program onto a USB stick, snapped it into my old computer, and all of my critical files were transferred seamlessly to my new computer. Plus, with Virtualization, I can run almost ANY program I purchased in the last sixteen years on my new machine at SMOKIN' speeds. Plus, Windows still supports PostScript Type 1 fonts. Can Mac users say this about any Classic OS programs they purchased or, with Snow Leopard, PS fonts?</p>
<p>Windows isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it&rsquo;s far more capable than you give it credit for. Plus, I second Hrant&rsquo;s objection: pretty design doesn&rsquo;t make up for a fascist, condescending business philosophy&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Mark, for putting us back on thread. Just for the record: I did not at first buy an apple because of the &lsquo;propaganda&rsquo; (all the mac vs. pc stuff had not landed back then), the simple reason was: I worked as a desktop publisher for a year and worked on a mac there. It was one of the oldstyle macs, just as gray on drab as any computer of the day. Then I started studying graphic design, and because I leart everything concerning design on a mac until that point, I bought one of the first iMacs. I then over time transferred to MacMini to (now 6 yr old) iBook. Considering it&rsquo;s age it still works quite well. I&rsquo;ve looked at other platforms now, mainly because they are cheaper, but the thought of switching to windows just keeps me from it. I may be biased, but I would have to change my workflow so drastically, that, and my bad experience with windows (95, 2000, Vista)and the fact that macs have been quite reliable for me, just makes me sticking with them. I could not be bothered with a the marketing jadajada surrounding apple (if you knew me personally, you would understand) but it just works for me. that&rsquo;s all. sorry if that got on yr nerves&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Queneau,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to hear that your experiences with Macs has been overwhelmingly positive. As for me, perhaps I&rsquo;m one of a fortunate few but, in the twenty years I&rsquo;ve been using Windows, I have never once had to re-install the OS, rebuild the desktop or clear the font cache to get my machine to behave the way it&rsquo;s supposed to. And, with all due respect, if you really were immune to the Sizzlemeister&rsquo;s iRule:uSuck drumbeat, you never would have offered the snide aside about Windows 7 which started this silly sidebar in the first place&hellip;</p>
