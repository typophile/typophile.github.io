body: "Please pardon the garbled title, it describes pretty accurately what I\u2019m
  currently wondering about\u2026 (and my state of mind, probably, too.)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  designing/typesetting a booklet and have come across some words (in languages like
  French and German) that take optional feminine endings. In the typoscript they\u2019re
  set in parentheses to show that both forms are included. This is not unusual, but
  rather ugly:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/parens-big_4976.gif]\r\n\r\nIs
  it possible that there might be a way to use smaller parentheses here (these are
  from the smallcaps)? Or am I crazy? Do these look out of place?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/parens-small_5178.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/parens-french_5981.png]\r\n\r\nI\u2019d
  appreciate feedback, or any ideas / tales of precedent for how this might be typeset
  in a way that is both recognizable, and not too disruptive/ugly. Thanks!"

    I think that would be less jarring for those 1 \u2030 of us who will ever notice.
    Reminds me of a really old thread were I was dissatisfied with a lining percentage
    mark next to old style numerals."

    consciously put a finger on the full-size parens bothering them, they would still
    benefit from the smaller ones.\r\n\r\nOne thing to worry about no matter what
    size parens you use, but especially if you use \"unexpected\" ones: many designers
    don't includne kerning for things preceding a left paren (or things beyond punctuation
    following a right paren).\r\n\r\nBTW, optionality is often indicated with square
    brackets, not parens - but those would generally be more jarring.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    with parentheses the center vertically on the x-height (e.g. anything from Shinntype
    :-)\r\n\r\nAlso, for my taste the parentheses in your sample are too straight.\r\n\r\nSubstituting
    parentheses from a different font is another option."

    getting the feeling the best solution is somewhere between those two. Yes, maybe
    moving the large ones slightly down, or maybe setting the small ones a hint larger.
    (And Hrant, I am kerning these manually anyway. Parens inside words almost always
    need it.)"

  body: 'I would use normal parentheses, not the small caps, which to a graphic designer
    could look better, but I have the feeling that, when read at a small text size,
    they will risk to disappear to a reader''s eye. But check out the kerning: in
    the German text example, it seems to me that you need to increase the kerning
    a little in some cases: in ...e(n) and ...r(in), for example, the e and r and
    nearly touching the parenthesis, and its seems that some more space is needed
    there.'

    such as the beginning of a line, or parenthesization of whole words/phrases/sentences,
    but \u201Cfails\u201D in Nina\u2019s usage here.\r\n\r\nI am tempted to consider
    implementing contextual substitution of alternate parentheses for letter-parenleft
    and parenright-letter combinations, with wider sidebearings on the \u201Coutside\u201D.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nWhy
    parentheses?\r\nA discrete periodcentered would work better \u2014 breaking up
    the word rather like syllabicization in dictionaries.\r\nI think readers would
    \u201Cget\u201D that immediately."

    which however most people find ugly; or parentheses; or sometimes a slash. Which
    one of these is used is also an editorial decision. The client would like parentheses,
    and I don\u2019t feel I should invent something new here \u2013 this is not so
    rare as to warrant a completely new/customized approach, and I tend to agree with
    Frode that it\u2019s probably a good idea to stick with what people are [getting]

    In linguistics one often encounters things that are either optional or contextually
    dependent, surrounded with parentheses. Since parens are mostly cap-height or
    ascender height, the effect is jarring. See this list of suffixes, for example:
    <em>\u2011ch</em>, <em>\u2011k(w)</em>, <em>\u2011x(w)</em>, <em>\u2011(\u02BC)n</em>,
    <em>\u2011ts</em>.\r\n\r\nThere are pairs of Unicode parens for superscript and
    subscript elements which are very useful for phonetic transcriptions that use
    a lot of superscript and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 subscript modifiers.
    These are far more readable than their full-sized parenthesis counterparts: \u2011k\u207D\u02B7\u207E,
    \u2011t\u026C\u207D\u02B9\u207E, t\u0283\u207D\u02B0\u207E\u2011, \u2011l\u207D\u02E4\u207E,
    \u2011t\u208D.\u208Es\u2011, \u2011\u014B\u208D\u208A\u208E versus \u2011k(\u02B7),
    \u2011t\u026C(\u02BC), t\u0283(\u02B0)\u2011, \u2011l(\u02E4), \u2011t(.)s\u2011,
    \u2011\u014B(\u208A). (Pretend that those examples are all in an appropriate typeface
    rather than mangled by your browser.) Having a similar pair of parentheses for
    x-height elements would be a major typographic improvement, though I imagine it
    would take some time to catch on given that the superscript and subscript ones
    are only beginning to see regular use."
