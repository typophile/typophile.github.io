  site, but I value the input of the creative members of typophile.\r\n\r\nI am looking
  for critque, ideas and possibly entries into a logo design contest that we are hosting
  on another site.\r\n\r\nThe contest is being held at [[http://contests.sitepoint.com/contests/4033]].\r\n\r\nDetails
  of our intentions are in the summary and brief.\r\n\r\nI've also posted another
  link [[http://scn.ca/SCN_Logo_Contest/index.html]] to our current logo (top) and
  the recently redesigned logo of our broadcast network. The [[http://scn.ca/SCN_Logo_Contest/SCN_Station_ID.mp4|SCN_Station_ID.mp4]]
  link at the bottom portrays the full effect of our rebrand and how we identify on-air
  with our viewers. \r\n\r\nI would really like to hear some feedback regarding our
  recent Broadcast Network rebrand.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    and is offering $300? \r\nI just heard the premier say he wants the province to
    get the same consideration other more prominent provinces get from Ottawa, but
    this seems to strike me as a step backwards in that goal for equal respect.\r\n\r\nThe
    majority of the entries are horrible, as you'd expect from open contests like
    this. "

    paid and even if i do win i'll get much less than half of what i'd charge for
    a basic identity package\r\n\r\nthis is amazing thank you for the opportunity
    to work for free\r\n\r\njust say the magic words \"it can go in your portfolio\"
    and \"it will bring in other clients\" i'm all over it"

  body: "I think the AIGA says it best:\r\n\r\n\"AIGA believes that doing speculative
    work seriously compromises the quality of work that clients are entitled to and
    also violates a tacit, long-standing ethical standard in the communication design
    profession worldwide. AIGA strongly discourages the practice of requesting that
    design work be produced and submitted on a speculative basis in order to be considered
    for acceptance on a project.\"\r\n\r\nSee also this [[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/new-challenges-from-the-lowballersand-what-to-do|lowballers
    article]], which gives more insight into the respect our profession deserves,
    though focusing on a different situation.\r\n\r\nPlease know and respect your
    audience's views before bringing something like this to the table."

  body: "I think I would start over with all the logos and your website. I would have
    a hard time getting inspired with the current website. It shouldn't be hard to
    find a designer who could handle the whole job. Find someone whose work you like
    and be prepared to pay them.  Maybe you could find a local design firm who would
    do it at a discount in exchange for on-air and website promotion. I see shows
    on PBS that say \"This program is brought to you by the Cheryl and Henry La-dee-dah
    Foundation\". Maybe you could make some kind of exchange that way. Then your station
    and the designer would get something of real value.\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: "Imagine a hospital where anybody could enter a contest to diagnose a patient,
    and the one who was right would win a prize. No truly qualified doctor would ever
    enter because it would not be worth their time, the patient would most likely
    suffer, and nobody would take the hospital seriously.\r\n\r\nObviously this would
    never happen in real life, but if you replace \"doctor\" with \"designer\", \"patient\"
    with \"logo\", and \"hospital\" with \"client\", it somehow becomes acceptable?
    Do the right thing and hire a real designer unless you want your logo to suffer
    and nobody to take your business seriously.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
