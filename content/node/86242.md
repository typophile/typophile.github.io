  and designers can upload their artwork and have people vote and critique their work.
  The top \"5\" artworks each month get put into limited edition production on a Plank
  (i.e. skateboard), a t-shirt and an art quality print. Anyone can vote on the artwork
  through a 5 star rating system as well as a comments section. The art venue is about
  promoting the artwork of known artists and launching the careers of unknown artists.
  The Blank Plank is interested in getting great art into the hands of as many people
  as possible for a reasonable price. The website will be launching at the beginning
  of November with 10 specially invited artists to be on the roster where people can
  buy their art work as well as upload art.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KS-Artist-6_5953.jpg]"

    to me it seems like a great way to do unpaid work for someone who just leeches
    off artists without doing much hard work or assuming much risk. "
