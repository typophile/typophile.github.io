  body: BTW It&#39;s the horrifying Adobe version with straight verticals.  <BR>Please
    don&#39;t use that one but go for the slightly flaring original.

  body: I seem to recall that the Adobe originally included two versions on the diskette--the
    horrifying version and the normal version--and instructions about which version
    to use when.

  body: Interesting -- the straight verticals are what kept me from identifying it
    myself. I&#39;d usually recognize Optima straight away, but I didn&#39;t realize
    there was a &#34;horrifying&#34; version. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
