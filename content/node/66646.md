  it is a function in Illustrator... Allowing you to give a very subtle rounded edge
  to fonts.\r\n\r\nThe example uses Helvetica, but we can notice a soft / rounded
  edge ... especially on the \"15\"\r\n\r\nAny info is welcome! :)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    for titling pruposes for example...\r\ni doubt they use quick made free faces...
    there must be a way to transform the actual typeface\r\n\r\n??\r\n"

    be to \r\n<ol><li>Select a radius for your rounded corners--say, 12 units);</li>\r\n<li>In
    the EFFECTS menu, select BOLD, uncheck \"Keep glyph dimensions,\" then select
    -12 for H weight and V weight;</li>\r\n<li>In the same menu, check \"Make round
    corners\" and change the weight to +12.</li></ol>\r\nYou can fiddle with the values
    to get the effects you're looking for..."
