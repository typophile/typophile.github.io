body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nRecently I was approached by an artist to draw a custom lettering
  based on the NEWMAN logo for an installation. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newman_5952.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  decided to check if someone drew a typeface based on the original logo design from
  Mr. Loewy but couldn't find any reference.\r\nIf someone could help me locate a
  similar looking typeface, I'd appreciate, thanks.\r\n\r\nBest, M"

  body: Since the logotype is an ambigram, it's doubtful that anyone developed a full

    but isn't quite the same.\r\n\r\nI'd check the techno section of dafont. There
    might be something similar there.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    happens, I'll probably draw it myself.
