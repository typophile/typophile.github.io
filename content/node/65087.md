  'a' and the way the top of the bowl joins the stem.\r\n\r\nCan anyone recognise
  it? BTW I've looked for better images but can't find any with more detail than these
  two.\r\n\r\nI'll kick myself if you identify it as a common font I should know!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sanmarino_4289.jpg]"
