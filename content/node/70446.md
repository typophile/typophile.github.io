body: "It is a common feature nowadays for type designers to create custom typefaces
  for corporate identity, logos, or newspapers. A less seen option seems to be making
  typefaces specifically for books/publishing houses. In Italy we've had the great
  example of the Garamond crafted in the 1950s by the Simoncini foundry for Einaudi
  publishing house (still the most used type in Italy's editorial market). More recently,
  type designer Luciano Perondi has designed a a Caslonesque custom face for the Mattioli
  1885 edition:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/32a_mattioli_3970.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd,
  even more recently, the same Perondi, a gifted Italian type designer, made another
  attempt with a Baskerville-inspired typeface for Voland, another Italian publishing
  house; this typeface will be officially launched tomorrow at the Turin bookfair,
  but I had the chance to see a copy of a new book set with it and, at a first glance,
  it indeed looks like a contemporary take on Baskerville. Here is a sample anyway:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/perondi_voland_5501.jpg]\r\n\r\nCan
  someone else give more examples of custom typefaces made for publishing houses -
  meaning for setting long texts in novels, essays, poetry books and the likes?\r\n\r\nAnd
  how do type designers consider being commissioned for a typeface meant for specific
  editorial (books) use?"

    a good point: there is little similarity in Lucerna to Veritas (as opposed to
    none); the two typefaces are closely related, as the design and thinking of Veritas
    laid the groundwork for Lucerna. (I amended my article to clarify).\r\n\r\nBecause
    the management of Tyndale preferred specific aspects of ITC Giovanni, we chose
    to emulate key design characteristics of Giovanni, which pleased the management
    team, and allowed us the freedom to do what we wanted with the rest of the glyphs.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lucerna-side-by-side-CT_4693.jpg]"
