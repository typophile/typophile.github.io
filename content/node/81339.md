  but I just don't have it on my system. I have New Century Schoolbook and have been
  pairing it with Futura for a while. Unfortunately, I don't have a lot many weights
  for NCS and it's a little stiffling. This font, however, looks quite similar in
  feel, but has more flexibility, perhaps. It seems like the examples show different
  versions of the same font, so I wondered if you all can figure it out.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\na\r\n"
