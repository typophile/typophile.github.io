  body: To have your typeface referred to as a size. Grand compliment indeed.

  body: I had the tragic fortune of driving through the state of Texas this past year
    while the Clearview signs were being phased in. It was fascinating to see Clearview
    side by side with the remaining Highway Gothic signage - which was pretty common
    especially in larger freeway areas. I must say, seniors didn't come to mind though.

  body: I've driven in Texas and it didn't seem too bad - just remember to floor it
    and don't use your turn signals - nothing to it really.
