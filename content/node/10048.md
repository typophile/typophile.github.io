  body: Any reasonable person would conclude that in order for the statement &#34;The
    Source of the Originals&#34; to be accurate, Linotype need only be the source
    of two or more &#39;originals&#39;. No one could argue that this statement is
    incorrect.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: 'The German Supreme Court recently had to decide this case: <BR> <BR>A bus
    tourism company invited people to a bus tour. The company said in advertisements
    that the bus tourists will be given &#34;a delicious meal&#34;. In fact, they
    got a meal, but it was &#34;a soup with beans&#34;. The Supreme Court judged this
    as &#34;criminal advertising&#34;, and the business manager of the bus company
    got a one-year stretch &#40;see German Supreme Court record BGH 3 StR 11/02&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Now compare the &#34;delicious meal&#34; buyers to the &#34;Basic Commercial&#34;
    buyers. Do the font buyers get the &#34;original&#34; designed in 1900 by &#34;the
    source of the originals&#34;, i.e. do they get &#34;a delicious meal&#34;? Or
    do they get a clone made in 1958, i.e. do they get &#34;a soup with beans&#34;?
    It is most likely that the German Supreme Court will decide that the &#34;Basic
    Commercial&#34; buyers get &#34;a soup with beans&#34;. <BR> <BR>W.O'
