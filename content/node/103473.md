  got it from. Already tied to reverse-image-search it, but without results. Anyone
  has a clue what font that is. Laurenz Brunner made a mono for Casco Projects a couple
  of years ago, which has a similar look, but that\u2019s not for sale as far as i
  know.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/c0033915_48d52f728dcde_6625.jpg]"

    meant can be seen [[http://www.cascoprojects.org/?entryid=516|here]].\r\nBut it\u2019s
    only similar not quite the same \u2026 "
