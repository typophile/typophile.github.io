  body: "According to the <strong>[[http://luc.devroye.org/SolotypeCatalogTHP.txt|Solotype
    Catalog]]</strong> I found in Luc Devroye pages:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>Casablanca:</strong>\tDigital
    versions include Brendel's CASSIUS; Novel's CinCin; Opti's Civet Light; Prima's
    Clarksville. There's also an ITF/Red Rooster version by Adrian Williams.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nCasablanca
    is the original name, but you can look for any of the digital versions"

  body: Thanks a lot. Cassius seems to be the best match I'm able to find. I don't
    see any bold or italic versions of it, however, but it's definitely better than
    nothing.
