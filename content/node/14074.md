  I can find is the Enter Sandman font but its not quite it. Can anyone find out the
  font please? Thanks.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.uwahardcorewrestling.com/phpBB2/templates/graphite/images/header.gif"

  body: To me, it looks like someone used <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/serpentine/d-bold-italic/testdrive.html?s=uwa+hardcore+mrestling&p=36"
    target="_blank">Serpentine Bold Italic</a>, but rotated an m to make a w, cropped
    an n to make an ugly r and did who knows what to that s. The whole thing was then
    condensed a bit.

    by editing the font.
