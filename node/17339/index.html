<p>In general, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of free-font recommending going on around here. Many fonts that are offered for free online are actually pirated versions of commercial fonts. The designers of many of those commercial fonts tend to be represented here.</p>
<p>But for good resources on finding legit free fonts, try <a href="http://www.fontleech.com">http://www.fontleech.com</a> and <a href="http://www.typeforge.net/cms/index.php?option=com_weblinks&amp;Itemid=29&amp;lang=en">http://www.typeforge.net/cms/index.php?option=com_weblinks&amp;Itemid=29&amp;lang=en</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A few months ago I spent some time looking into John Day&rsquo;s work. Amongst other things, he, rather than Caslon, was the first English punch-cutter of serious ability, producing work which would seem to most of us now Garamondian, but which was really in the broad, light though low-contrast, serenely even manner of Jean de Tournes of Lyon - a kind of Renaissance Baskerville, though with better proportions.</p>
<p>Day put up the great Francois Guyot in his house for a while, and used a double pica roman and italic typeface of his; Day Roman and Heine&rsquo;s Tribute, issued by Emigre, are both modelled on this same type. Tribute was <a href = 'http://www.emigre.com/EFoITrbF.php'>approved</a> by John Downer but <a href='http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/troop-on-tribute.txt'>demolished </a> by Bill Troop. In the same commentary, the Apostrophic Labs sketch of the roman, only a few hours' work, is held up as far more sensitive, though it could hardly have been other than &lsquo;inadequately conceptualised&rsquo;. Having looked hard at the original, I agree, and the contrast is fine, but the descenders have been brutally truncated. I also like Tribute: it&rsquo;s hardly a revival, but very attractive, perhaps best thought of as &lsquo;Mrs Guyot&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually know whether the DTL italic would synthesize at all with the Apostrophic roman, but each is good. I think you&rsquo;d just have to play around if you really wanted to find a matching italic - Granjon italics might work.</p>

Yes, you do get what you pay for, no Thomas 99% of free fonts are not necessarily crap, but, yes, there are a lot of rip-off fonts out there. For good or even great free fonts one need only look at Manfred Klein&rsquo;s stuff at <a href="http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein/">http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein/</a>
One might argue that since &ldquo;bundled&rdquo; fonts are free with purchased software that those fonts are crap, but they aren&rsquo;t are they? But this is another discussion.

<p>I&rsquo;ve downloaded and printed some of Marini&rsquo;s Fell Revivals at 600dpi, and I&rsquo;m speechless.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iginomarini.com/fell.html">http://www.iginomarini.com/fell.html</a></p>
<p>Is it my untrained eye, or do these truly look beautiful. It is as if I&rsquo;m reading one of the very early (modern) editions of Tacitus. The italics seem to have just the right amount of ink &ldquo;spill&rdquo; or thickening in certain areas, such as the italic lower case &ldquo;n&rdquo; in the De Walpergen Pica (at 10.5pt.) And the way the middle curl on the &ldquo;w&rdquo; is just a bit too thick to allow the inner white area to show through completely. This is really brilliant stuff.</p>

<p>Even his free &ldquo;Lido&rdquo; is fantastic, although the TrueType version&rsquo;s italics lack kerning (or was it the OpenType version?) Anyway I already e-mailed him about this, and he was shocked. I assume he fixed this problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let me re-phrase that: 95-99% of the free fonts that aren&rsquo;t rip-offs of retail fonts are junk. Then again, I think that at least 20-40% of retail fonts are junk, too. Maybe half or more when I&rsquo;m in a bad mood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of Sturgeon&rsquo;s Law. Science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon was asked why there was so much bad science fiction out there. He said: &ldquo;Sure, 90% of science fiction is crud. That&rsquo;s because 90% of everything is crud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Interestingly, whenever this is quoted, people tend to replace &ldquo;crud&rdquo; with another word.)</p>

<p>DTL offered some &ldquo;trial&rdquo; fonts - maybe they still do? - with complete miniscules, but only 6 or so majuscules, basic punctuation, and 3 or so numerals. It was a good way to get a feel for how the type might set up and colour the page, but was not possible to use for a job. (Unless you were setting an e.e. cummings poem, maybe&hellip;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Underware, at TypeCon 05, was selling small sample books for Dolly and Sauna for about $10 or something. Each was filled with interesting facts and stories related to and set in the font and each included a CD with the entire font family on it for trial use. I thought that was a brilliant idea and bought both. I&rsquo;ve been suggesting them to clients where appropriate and am scraping together cash myself because they&rsquo;re both great faces and I&rsquo;ve had a chance to try them out (someday soon I&rsquo;ll have them). It makes my life as a designer so much easier.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve actually licensed a font family from FontShop because of their free single weight downloads, which I used in a comp for a client.</p>
<p>Both of these are good examples of quality type for free (I consider the cost of the first one to be for the books, not the fonts), but one has restricted usage and the other has the restriction of being one weight, so there&rsquo;s a trade-off. But it seems like a fair one to me.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;suiting the purpose&rsquo; has a lot of objective elements: if for extended reading it&rsquo;s comfortable to read at the intended size; it doesn&rsquo;t waste paper, if that is a need, it can get the readable result with the technology available, etc.</p>
<p>Aesthetics have a fairly large scope of at least inter-subjective standards. You can talk about balance, variety, color across very different kinds of typeface. Just as Picasso&rsquo;s women are often ugly, but well drawn by a lot of graphic design standards. Then there is also the element of personal taste, of course. But it isn&rsquo;t all a matter of personal taste and preference.</p>
<p>For example, for the screen at 10 pt Georgia is better than University Roman. I also happen personally to detest University Roman, but that is another matter.</p>

<p>We can debate the aesthetics part of this, but there definitely <strong>IS</strong> such a thing as a bad font when one is talking about the technical and craft aspects of font design.</p>
<p>There are of course some really first-rate free fonts out there, and this is a fine place to come and get pointers to them. But even among those, there are precious few that can give you a serifed text face that comes complete with regular, bold, italic and bold italic variants. If you need a basic family like that, some otherwise great free fonts won&rsquo;t fit the bill (e.g. Gentium).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wonder if there has been another industry (other than the current plague of unauthorized copying and distribution of &ldquo;free&rdquo; music and videos) that virtually gave away its products.</p>
<p>I understand the marketing brilliance of Gillette giving away free razors with handle when launching Mach2 and Mach3, since you can&rsquo;t keep shaving with the same razor forever.</p>
<p>I know that in the infancy of software development, PC based games, freeware, etc., somehow initiated no cost benefit to end users.</p>
<p>I realize that font bundling, originally done by equipment manufactures and now by software companies, gave away enough fonts in order for the end user to get a running start.</p>
<p>But the perpetuating concept of FREE FONTS to new users of type has created a consumer base that think fonts are too expensive to buy.</p>
<p>On one side is the user base, which is comprised mostly of individuals and companies who don&rsquo;t (or don&rsquo;t now how to) make money using type. Yes, it&rsquo;s not like the &ldquo;ol' days&rdquo; when typesetting service cost money and type shops bought fonts as part of business.</p>
<p>I think the agencies and graphic designers today are forgetting (or ignoring) the typesetting aspect of what they do. Somehow, even if the client provides the text file, the use of the type itself should have value. For instance, when estimating or billing a newsletter why can&rsquo;t you assign a typesetting fee for characters set? New typefaces are premium priced.<ul></p>
<li>1500 characters using FF Absara Sans (new design) @ $.005 per character = $7.50</li>
<li>800 characters using Adobe Jenson Pro (bundled InDesign) @ $.001 per character = $.80</li>
<li>1700 characters using Helvetica (bundled with equipment) @ $.00 per character = $.00</li></ul>
<p>Even if you (the designers out there who want fonts for free) don&rsquo;t actually put this fee on the invoice, you should calculate it into the final price to the client.</p>
<p>You should be thinking in terms of the value of type on paper or screen. Your grandpa made money setting type, so why are you giving it away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreed, there are bad fonts, but as has been mentioned, a font should be individually appraised by each person for their needs and not automaticaly assumed that an ‘experts’ opinion is one that should be accepted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If &ldquo;each person&rdquo; is a knowledgeable graphic designer or a typographer, maybe. But many graphic designers do not have sufficient knowledge.</p>
<p>Worse, most other users are certainly not able to appraise these issues. That&rsquo;s why when given access to the internet they download fun but badly made fonts and use them in highly inappropriate ways. Or they just use Times and Arial (or Helvetica) without even thinking, which in such cases might be an improvement.</p>
<p>Of course, you yourself make somewhat lower quality and much less expensive retail fonts, and I sought out my job at a company that makes relatively high quality and expensive (when not bundled) fonts, so I guess it&rsquo;s predictable that we would have opposite views on this matter, eh wot?</p>

<p>While some views are opposing, I am generally in agreement with you. There are a lot of free fonts out there which are bad. I am probably responsible for a good proportion of them myself.</p>
<p>Well crafted fonts should be the priority in any commercial endeavour, but a lot (not all) of people after free fonts, as the original question in this thread was, are not after them for commercial use, therefore they should have the ability to use any font, good or bad, as long as it suits the effect and appeal they want. Advise is always acceptable of course.</p>
<p>Also, thanx for the casual backhand slap across the face. Unfortunately I am not priveliged like some to have skill, training and the access to a company who is prepared to supply all the goodies and assistance required to make better fonts, So I will plug away at the rubbish I seem to be making, teaching myself by my own mistakes and enjoying it. I have never deluded myself, or others, that I am anything but average. I do it in the spare time I have, and as a family man, do not let it become the do all and be all of my existence.</p>
<p>All best.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Graham, you have no need to apologize for what you are doing. A simple fact which seems to have eluded most of the participants in this particular forum is that free fonts constitute a first line of defense against font theft. You may notice that our clueless little friend who began this thread didn&rsquo;t ask where she could find &ldquo;a few good free fonts&rdquo;; rather, she was interested in acquiring LOADS of free fonts.</p>
<p>In our acquisitive society, those among us who sell our fontwares benefit from the phenomenon by which fonts have acquired the cachet of <strong>bling</strong>, which—as everyone knows—one cannot have too much of (remember: whoever dies with the most fonts, wins). If there were not LOADS of free fonts to be had, our greedy little friends would most likely turn to acquiring pirated commercial fonts, much like they turn to acquiring pirated commercial music (maybe someone with the RIAA ought to be paying attention here).</p>
<p>So, rather than slamming the creators of freeware fonts, more people engaged in the selling of fonts ought to be thanking them: they do what they do because they love doing it and, in the process, they perform an invaluable service for those of us who do it for love AND money&hellip;or just money.</p>
<p>Thank you, Graham, and everyone else who satisfies the gluttons&hellip;</p>

<p>Thanx for words, and agreed, one of the most unusual explanations on why we need freeware fonts.</p>
<p>My period on freeware fonts was started by an interest in doing something constuctive with my free time, and I will be the first to admit, quality went out the door. You end up on a spiral where you have to get more out, quicker, and you do end up learning, but usually at the expense of everything you should be doing.</p>
<p>I quite making free stuff about two years ago, mainly due to the rudeness of a lot of people who were virtually demanding free stuff. I made a lot of friends, yes, but more rude, obnoxious people. Now I can take more time to learn properly as I go, and hopefully I will improve each time I make one.</p>

<p>One thing I, too, learned from my freeware font days about greedy freeloaders: their sense of entitlement is boundless, and they have WAY more enough gall to be divided into way more than three parts. And do remember: time spent doing something you love to do is never wasted, even&ndash;or especially&ndash;if you make some mistakes along the way.

<p>You&rsquo;re fortunate, I suppose. A few examples from my experience (not their actual words, but their true intent):</p>
<p>A. Hey, Nick, I really like this Blue Island font, but I don&rsquo;t want to pay for it. How about you make a free version of it? That way, the original designer gets screwed, you do lots of work for nothing, and I get the font for free&hellip;</p>
<p>B. Hey, Nick, I spend hours playing with the type testers for your commercial fonts (although I never buy any of them); how about you make testers for all your freeware fonts, so I can waste <em>even more </em>of my time and your money (bandwidth fees) playing around?</p>
<p>On top of that, a number of freeloading free font sites were hot-linking back to my site, rather that hosting my free stuff on their servers. When the bill for excess bandwidth charges passed a thousand dollars in one year (to GIVE stuff away), I thought it was time to call it quits. Am I bitter? No: just a little wiser about the habits of the clueless, the greedy, and moral midgets in general&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, incorrect. I am not bitter. Many people did and do show appreciation, and my view of it was the cynics and freeloaders were the ones getting bitter. The world for me is not cruel, just some of the idiots who inhabit it. Oops, sorry, just realised your comment was cynical, making you a cynic.</p>
<p>Why do you have no problems with leechers ? How would I know, maybe they just dont want your stuff. I had no problems with leechers, so why even bring this remark up. I had problems with the ignorant and arrogant, but not leechers.</p>

<p>Good point, Graham. I gave the world over 200 free fonts, a lot of them (my early work) pretty much crap (part of the learning process), but a fair number of them were pretty decent (decent enough to get me licensing deals from Agfa-Monotype, Bitstream and ITC). So, what&rsquo;s your contribution to the greater good, Sergej?</p>

<p>My question, though, is serious — and I ask it not because I don&rsquo;t know the answer, but because I think it&rsquo;s relevant to this discussion.

<p>By leechers I simply meant people Nick prefers to call freeloaders.

<p>How come I never had problems with any kind of freeloaders? (— While you did?)</p>

<p>Actually, I want to take my question back and not rephrase it. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth no matter what I do with it. It&rsquo;s simply a wrong question to ask on Typophile.</p>

<p>This is another can of worms. But once you remove copying restrictions I really don&rsquo;t know that EULAs or any other measure can actually provide protection. In the early digital years, and pre-digital (analog) years, licensing was fairly clear, simply because proprietary interests were understood and legally binding. Once that was done away with (and not for the common good as one might assume), well, all hell breaks loose. I assume those with the most power and money, figured they would be the beneficiaries. And, actually, they were. But they still do the obligatory whining. But do you really think they actually care about someone copying their fonts? There are far bigger concerns at play.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sole-product foundries like P22 and FontFont and Bitstream and Emigre that are hurt most by these &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; schemes, not Adobe or Microsoft or Linotype or Monotype Imaging.</p>

<p>Yes, but, this is just finger wagging isn&rsquo;t it? Once the technology for unlicensed copying was put in place and Pandora&rsquo;s Box was opened, it became a matter of trying to legislate human nature.</p>
<p>In regard to our little corner of the world:</p>
<p>The early font wars were not over type sales, they were over who would control the method of transmission. Type sales were never a major part of Adobe, though they were quite important for name recognition. Adobe unlicensed its PS1 format as an attempt to make the PostScript Page Description Language the de facto standard. In doing so it eliminated the similar aspirations of its main competitor Bitstream.</p>
<p>Providing the PS1 format to Altys literally opened the door for the indy foundry and for anyone else; all one had to do was buy a copy of FOG and you were in business whether with good intentions or no. Adobe wasn&rsquo;t concerned with all this sudden new unregulated competition because they controlled the means of transmission. And they had far larger plans for it.</p>
<p>Adobe put a lot of free guns on the street, so to speak, because it owned the ammunition. And ammunition sales far outweigh gun sales. As a result there is a lot of gun play and we good folk are left with the meager option of telling the bad folk it&rsquo;s not nice to shoot off guns. Well, they are going to. Because they can.</p>

Palatine:
"On the topic of Apostrophic Labs’ Day Roman, a few questions:
How does it compare to similar commercial fonts? It looks like a quality typeface, but without italics, unfortunately. DTL Van den Keere is one possiblity. Are there any others?"
</cite>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a font expert, but i&rsquo;ve run across this free font: 
<a><a href="http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein05/text/medieval.htm">http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein05/text/medieval.htm</a></a>
(from typoasis), which could work with Day Roman. The problem is that MedievalItalique is quite tight, and Day Roman is much lighter.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
