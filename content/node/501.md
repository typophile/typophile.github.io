  body: 'Hi Geraint , This reminds me of  a more artistic expression of  Barry Deck&#39;s
    Eunuverse which I really like. First  thing that strikes me is the name, why call
    it a Franklin? It does not seem like a Franklin.  I think it is great that you
    are starting from sketches, a lot can be explored with pen and ink. To take this
    to the next level consider end user. Are you going to make a Family or just  a
    single weight/style.  The widths are very broad on forms with curves and rather
    narrow on the rest, I think we may have a problem here with legibility, especially
    in text settings. The &#34;a&#34;s are designs similar to what I in the past have
    seen in Gaelic fonts but here the glyph is an &#34;a&#34;, and it is a &#34;d&#34;
    in Gaelic fonts.Interesting. The  &#34;s&#34; seems to small. Best glyphs are
    the g, h, j, k, t, x, y. Will you make stems the same or is it intentional that
    some a wider than others and some straight and others with curves &#40;ie. m is
    straight, r is curved&#41; Soft curves are nice and organic, I do this a lot in
    my own type designs, but perhaps this trend is coming towards an end.  '

  body: hey ole, <BR> <BR>thanks for your comments. my first font, my first critique!  <BR>you
    flatter me with the eunuverse comparison, tho<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>the name is playford, and i think its the best
    thing about the font!  <BR>messers playford, bell and myself, franklin, are friends;  <BR>i
    thought playford was perhaps feeling a bit left out not having a face bearing
    his name <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>my family plan &#40;crikey that sounds a bit scary&#41; is
    to have two weights,  <BR>one for reading extended text, and one for display applications.
    &#40;perhaps playford display / playford read&#41;.  <BR>this is the display version
    - much lighter, more contrast, and with features that emerge at larger point sizes.  <BR>thats
    the intention anyway.  <BR> <BR>the stem thickness &#42;should&#42; be uniform
    - that fact that they&#39;re not is down to my inconsistancy and bad draughting
    skills.  <BR>the idea was that the stems width should equal the widest part of
    the curved forms. <BR> <BR>as far as the tapers go on the stems, the idea was
    to have one side tapered &#40;maybe the internal edge&#41;, one side straight.  <BR>so
    i need to go back and redraw a whole bunch of these glyphs. not all, tho;  <BR>i
    don&#39;t have a problem with a mixture of curved and straight forms. <BR> <BR>a
    - yes, my thoughts exactly.  <BR>is it too close to a d?  <BR>perhaps i should
    set some text to get the context.  <BR>the a was the first glyph to be drawn.
    <BR> <BR>ok, perhaps some uc&amp;lc numerals will smoke out some more crits...

  body: i think the caps need a lot of work. <BR>there are loads of inconsistancies
    that have probably arisen  <BR>from hand-drawing isolated glyphs on separate pieces
    of paper :/ <BR> <BR>i think the stoke widths need to be evened out. <BR>the stem
    width of the U  seems too wide,  <BR>that of the I and R too narrow. <BR> <BR>the
    other thing i would appreciate some comment on <BR>is the tapering present on
    some of the ascenders &#40;one side of the stem only&#41;. <BR> <BR>heres a H
    for example. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12802.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR>i quite like that feature, and it will look a bit more even  when
    it is vectorised. <BR>i have not applied it consistantly to all characters - is
    this a problem?  <BR>i also have a feeling that its going to play havoc with rendering/hinting,  <BR>especially
    at small sizes. <BR> <BR>

    slightly overbold in relation to the blackness of the caps. <BR>what do you think?

  body: It seems to me &#40;I&#39;m no expert yet&#41; that you need to nudge your
    capital proportions closer to the classical Trajan proportions. I.e. make your
    T&#39;s and E&#39;s narrower, your S&#39;s a little wider, etc. Letters like N,
    D, and G should almost be the same width. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: i&#39;m with hrant on the whole &#34;a&#34; issue. that one sticks out like
    a sore thumb. i&#39;d suggest a single story &#34;a&#34; that looks similar to
    a rotated &#34;b&#34; with the &#40;now&#41; descender lopped off. i think the
    tapered vertical strokes are a nice touch, and can go a long way to giving the
    face a nice character. i&#39;d say, yes, be consistent in its application to similar
    verticals -- B, D, E, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, R. not sure about the I tho. maybe
    make it fluted on both sides. have you inspected optima as a reference point?

    so please defire to their expertise, but I just wanted to say... <BR>I really
    like #4.  Depending on what you are going for #3 is an excellent choice.  It feels
    historically/sterotypically correct with what I assume is the genere of the typeface.  What
    I personally like about #4 is that is is unexpected &#40;at least to me&#41; in
    that style.  It still reads as an &#34;a&#34; to me immediately, but it comes
    off as a fresh way to represent the character &#40;within that genere&#41;.  If
    you were to choose to do #4, I would however try to replicate the style in the
    letter &#34;e&#34; to maintain some consitency within the character set.  Maybe
    it can be part of the alternates set. For what its worth'
