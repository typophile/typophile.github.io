body: When it comes to marketing and selling type I think the typeheads at Norm/Lineto
  have done a brilliant job. I check their site once in a while and recently came
  across the posting about the new exclusive Simple Airport &#40;modified Simple&#41;
  typeface they designed for the Koln airport. <BR>First they sold Simple as a mono
  in 5 weight, each 180 Ch francs <BR>an great design but not very usable in a lot
  of applications. Then they re-designed and licensed it as a standardized Sans to
  a client. To top this they sell a small booklet about the re-design of Simple for
  20 Ch francs. Is this type marketing at it&#39;s finest or what. <BR>I am wondering
  what other foundries/designers have done similar types of marketing strategies,
  showcase their wares in a retail environment &#40;e-commerce&#41; as a mono or incomplete
  family and then rework it for a client. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/36470.jpg"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>On a similar note what happens when a designer &#40;or design firm&#41;
  gets a job where a commercial font that is choosen for the job needs to be modified
  or re-designed, and the client wants a copy of this modified font &#40;I have seen
  this done years ago with DIN for instance by some german design firm&#41;. In the
  case where the firm desires to do work inhouse instead of contracting the original
  font designer do it. I know vector outlines are usually  <BR>trade marked so what
  happens? It would obviously be very time  <BR>consuming to redesign from scratch
  just because the client desires a different lc &#34;g&#34; and perhaps a bolder
  weight, or perhaps tabular numerals &#40;that were not available&#41; but likes
  the font otherwise. Any comment would be appreciated. Perhaps this should have been
  several treads as there is several issues.
