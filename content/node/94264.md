    to post a new one.

  body: Are you certain this is a font? If it is it's likely modified. The r is way
    too heavy. The swash n is not only unusual, the n like ending is often used in
    old style scripts for p making that look more like a p than n.

  body: I found it in a magazine along with numerous other headers that were created
    using the type - which is why I think it is a typeface. Although you may have
    a point that it may be a typeface that was altered. I'm not sure - which is why
    I posted it.
