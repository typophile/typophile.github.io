body: I&#39;m typesetting a catalog for a client into several languages, and I realize
  that I don&#39;t know enough about editorial and typographic norms for Dutch and
  German. If anyone could answer these questions, I&#39;d appreciate it. <BR> <BR>1.
  What are the Dutch and German capitalization norms for titles and headlines? <BR>
  <BR>2. German does not use italics, correct? Do they indicate book titles in any
  particular way? How about Dutch? <BR> <BR>3. What are the best quotation marks to
  use for German and Dutch? <BR> <BR>4. Are there any other obvious rules I should
  know? <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: Paul, my only runin with German was when Remington Products thought they would
    sell cheap razors in Germany and we had to translate the user manual. We hired
    a translator and had them approve the galley proofs &#40;typesetting days&#41;
    I would guess it be a good  idea to invest in a translator and let the client
    assorb the cost. It always costs more to redo a job than to do it right in the
    first place.

    Duden</a>.</i> This is the offical German style guide. You&#39;ll need a German
    speaker to help you find the information you need, since the book is very large
    and detailed. <BR> <BR>2. German does use italics when set in &#39;antiqua&#39;
    type: the restriction against italics is for blackletter. However, <i>Der Duden</i>
    will provide details on <i>how</i> italics are used in German. <BR> <BR>3. The
    most common form of quotation marks today are opening baseline quotes &#40;look
    like commas&#41; and upper closing quotes &#40;note: what we think of as <i>left</i>
    quotes&#41;. These are included in the standard character sets for Western Europe.
    <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/20927.gif" alt="German
    quotes"> <BR> <BR>Formerly, German typesetters used inward-pointing guillemet.
    Refer to <i>Der Duden</i> for when to use single and double quotes. <BR> <BR>4.
    Do not be tempted to extrapolate from German typesetting rules to Dutch. Hopefully
    someone can direct you to a Dutch resource as useful as Der Duden is for German.'

  body: We&#39;ve already got translators, who have provided me with text translations.
    However, translators are copy writers, not typographers; which is why I have these
    questions. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: Thanks, John. I will definitely hunt down a copy of <i>Der Duden</i>, although
    probably not in time for this last-minute project. <BR> <BR>Any other input by
    anyone is appreciated ... <BR> <BR>Paul

    what about nesting? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    what, for instance, practice is in Austria or Switzerland. You would have to check
    <i>Der Duden</i> for nesting rules: I think it is single-double-double-single,
    but I&#39;m not certain.'

  body: '1. What are the Dutch capitalization norms for titles and headlines? <BR>
    <BR>None in particular. Start with a capital and then only names of &#34;things&#34;,
    cities and people are written i capitals. <BR>Or start every word with a capital
    - it&#39;s up to the designer to decide, not? As long as it&#39;s not an &#34;official&#34;
    paper for academies, research etc. there are no rules. <BR> <BR>2. German does
    not use italics, correct? Do they indicate book titles in any particular way?
    How about Dutch? <BR> <BR>In Dutch, titles are either written in Italics or small
    caps &#40;rare&#41; as far as I know. But again I think it&#39;s up to the designer
    really. <BR> <BR> <BR>3. What are the best quotation marks to use for Dutch? <BR>
    <BR>More and more single quotes. Nesting: single -double/double - single. Double
    quotes are still alright, but I find them old fashioned. <BR> <BR>4. Are there
    any other obvious rules I should know? <BR> <BR>No, not for Dutch, only if you&#39;re
    designing research papers, medical books, encyclopedias etc. &#40;what is the
    exact term for those things?&#41; where there is a list of resources you used.
