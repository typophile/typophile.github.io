  body: "Originally (predigitally) called Shalimar - and digitized by Type Revivals
    as <a href=\"http://www.roostertypes.com/prod_display_single.asp?catalog_id=19879\"
    target=\"_blank\">Shalimar</a>. Shreyas's Samarkand is just as legitimate a revival,
    though. I've no idea about the relative quality of the two fonts.\r\n\r\nNice
    ID, Shreyas."
