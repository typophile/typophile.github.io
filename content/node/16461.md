    font 200C and 200D. They are placed on the keyboards of many languages of Arabic
    script and up to now, my solution was to remove the outlines in the glyphs.\r\nBut
    recently I noticed that SIL International has produced a couple of wide range
    Arabic fonts with those outlines intact. But they don't show inside the text.\r\nI
    was wondering how they do that."

  body: "Benham, \r\n\r\nit's very simple: properly written Unicode applications don't
    just go ahead and blindly send all Unicode codepoints of the text into the font
    renderer. They know that certain Unicode codepoints have a special meaning and
    they don't request their rendering except in special contexts (when the user requests
    to visualize control characters). \r\n\r\nSo the font maps the Unicode codepoints
    to glyphs but the application normally does not request those Unicode codepoints
    (and therefore the glyphs) to be displayed. In some applications the user may
    turn on the display of control characters (e.g. by clicking on the paragraph symbol
    icon in Word). Then, the application should request for renderings of those glyphs.
    \r\n\r\nThe Unicode Standard defines which Unicode codepoints are normally non-printing.
    Unicode applications that are based on Microsoft Uniscribe obey that. The support
    for proper display of non-printing Unicode characters differs in other Unicode
    environments (Adobe CS2, Apple Cocoa/ATSUI, ICU/FreeType etc.) \r\n\r\nRegards,
    \r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Further to what Adam has written.\r\n\r\nWell designed applications for complex
    script text processing will give users the option to display control characters.
    This can be very important for document editing, and saves the user from having
    to guess what kind of invisible control characters might be embedded and where.
    So I disagree with Tom's advice to make the glyphs for control characters blank.
    If you do this, applications such as the MS Office suite will be unable to display
    control characters for users who have selected this option. So you should use
    conventional symbols, on zero-widths of course, to indicate the control characters.
    There are two sets of conventions: the best established involves thin vertical
    lines indicating the position of the control character, topped by a mark that
    identifies the kind of control character. I use a slightly different and visually
    tidier convention of marks above the text string. I will try to find some references
    for these conventions or provide some illustrations.\r\n\r\nGlyph processing may
    involve control characters (Microsoft's OT font specs actually require this for
    some Indic scripts). So a layout engine should make the glyphs available during
    GSUB processing, and then remove them from the glyph string during final display,
    unless, of course, the user has elected to display control characters. This is
    what Microsoft's Uniscribe does.\r\n\r\nThere is some disagreement between Microsoft
    and Adobe about whether control character glyphs should be used in glyph processing.
    Eric Muller at Adobe makes convincing arguments for why it should never be necessary.
    Microsoft have just gone ahead and done it. My money is on Microsoft winning this
    debate, which is why I recommend that makers of layout engines follow the Uniscribe
    approach."

  body: "Thanks for infomative feedback.\r\nYou may remember that I am the one who
    is making Arabic script cross-platform fonts and I reported a while back a bug
    in Tiger which was desengaging AAT portion of my AAT/OT fonts. Now with OS 10.4.3
    this bug is fixed, thanks mainly to you.\r\nFrom what I understand, this is essentially
    a text engine problem and nothing can be done at font level, particularly for
    a font dealing with different platforms and different text engines.\r\nAlthough
    your reasonning for keeping those outlines is very valid, but I think I'll go
    with Tom suggestion, at least for ZWJ and ZWNJ.\r\nThese codepoints are extensively
    used in some Arabic script languages and unlike codes like paragraph sign, they
    are not intended for any page layout processing. One may argue that the wrong
    codes are being used for this purpose but the fact is that they are on the keyboards
    of some languages and in some languages like Kurdish, it is the most used code
    amongst all. I can not afford to face a visible vertical line once or twice in
    each and every word!\r\nI have no control over the design of applications on different
    platforms but I do have control over the outlines of my glyphs!\r\nI think I'll
    remove them for ZWJ and ZWNJ but I'll keep them on other 'directioality' codes.
    As you mentioned they are required by some applications such as Microsoft but
    they are not on the keyboards.\r\n\r\nBut out of curosity,\r\nI opened an identical
    text with those codes both with my font and with SIL fonts on the same application
    (TextEdit for AAT and Mellel for OT on Mac), with both fonts having those outlines
    intact. SIL font didn't show them and mine did. There has to be some communication
    at font level that SIL font provides and mine doesn't."

    characters according to the Unicode properties, and paints these glyphs. So in
    this application Persian text and other languages that make frequent use of ZWJ
    or ZWNJ would indeed be a problem if the glyphs have a visible component. As I
    suggested earlier, I see this as an application bug, and I don't like trying to
    second guess such things when making fonts: I would rather follow a spec and established
    practice by the major technology supporter (in this case Microsoft), rather than
    trying to fix application and engine problems within the font.\r\n\r\nWhich SIL

    which was released a week or so ago, ZWJ and ZWNJ don't show anymore.\r\nMy main
    problem is with Apple and its engine. In TextEdit or in Safari, it does show those
    lines. But AAT version of SIL fonts (they are not cross-platform) don't show them
    in TextEdit. I had no way of testing it in Safari.\r\nIf Apple fixes this bug
    as well, I don't see any reason to remove the outlines. Unfortunately things move
    very slowly in rtl and particularly Arabic side and users (and myself) loose patience
    easily.\r\n\r\nThe fonts I was testing are two outstanding fonts released by SIL
    in mid-Summer. Each in two version of OT and AAT: Lateef and Shahrzad. They are

    to amaze me: they have been involved with Unicode since the very earliest years,
    and much earlier than Microsoft, and yet they lag so far behind in actual support.\r\n\r\nI'm

    right, John. ScheherazadeAAT includes lookups in the morx table that replace uni200C

    body: "I guess I can do that. It's somewhat more elegant than removing the outlines.
      \r\n\r\nPersian and Kurdish (and other) keyboards should have had 200B instead
      of ZWNJ to begin with... or 202F which is even better because it doesn't break.
      I bet this was MS idea to use ZWNJ!\r\n\r\nZWJ is different. It plays a very
      important role in producing a joining presentation form of an Arabic letter
      without (visually) being joint to anything. This has an important demonstrative
      role and also for creating acronyms. This is not as easily replaceable as ZWNJ
      which is essentially used as a special 'spacing' element.\r\n\r\nOn the other
      hand, I'm somewhat uncomfortable with this practice of adaptation to Apple's
      shortcomings. Apple amazes me too. On one hand, they are more advanced in supporting
      Unicode than anybody else because they seem to supporting it at the core of
      their OS. Windows seems to have Unicode support as a layer on top of its OS.\r\nIn
      Mac you can name a file or folder in Arabic or Persian or chinese or whatever.
      Try to do that in Windows! Never mind Windows, try to open one of Apple Japanese
      fonts with FontLab. It won't open. You have to change its Japanese name to a
      token English name to be able to open it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, they still
      didn't fix their problem with ZWJ and likes. OS X system font for Arabic script
      is Geeza Pro. It doesn't have any of these glyphs. Geeza's back-up for these
      codes is system's Helvetica. You open Helvetica and you see all those outlines
      are removed!\r\nSo it's not like they don't know about it. It's not their priority."

    that of <em>word joiner</em>. Until Unicode 3.2, U+FEFF was the only code point
