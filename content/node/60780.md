body: "I am considering selling some of my artwork and handmade home wares online
  and was playing around with making a logo. The shop name would be (as you can see)
  \"JR Home Goods,\" which I like because it's somewhat ambiguous allowing me to very
  my product range however I want over the long term.\r\n\r\nI have two versions here,
  I'd love to hear what you think generally of the large letters - I started with
  Plantagenet Cherokee and modified some elements in both letters (more in the R).
  Also, which version you like better.\r\n\r\nThanks! I've been out of design a little
  while so I\"m feeling rusty and your critiques will really help.\r\n\r\nI wanted
  to add - I know this is really basic. I like the idea of using the basic letterform
  logo then being about to apply it to a lot of different backgrounds, etc., online
  to change things up seasonally, etc."

  body: "I like the name, theres a tone of trustworthiness and solidness about it,
    something traditional and tangible. \r\n\r\nBut...\r\n\r\nIf its art you're selling,
    i'm not sure that 'home goods' would resonate with me. I buy quite a lot of original
    paintings, prints and drawings and 'home goods' is not something that i'm after
    when i buy art. Although I guess 'art' is a fairly broad term - maybe home goods
    works for the oeuvre you're selling?\r\n\r\nAnyway...\r\n\r\nIn terms of a logo,
    I don't think trying to integrate the JR into Home Goods is going to work well.
    I would explore some other options that treat the 'home goods' as more of a byline
    and the JR as more of a brand statement that can either stand alone or work with
    the byline.\r\n\r\n"
