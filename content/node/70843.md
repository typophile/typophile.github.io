  body: Since the QWERTY keyboard was designed to SLOW DOWN typists (in order to avoid
    mechanical jams), it's probably fair to assume that the row offsets had a similar
    purpose by design...

  body: "Oldnick: <em>Since the QWERTY keyboard was designed to SLOW DOWN typists
    (in order to avoid mechanical jams)</em>\r\n\r\nThis is a myth. The keyboard was
    designed to avoid jamming <em>at speed,</em> not to slow down the typist. The
    layout enabled the user of a mechanical typebar system to type English text at
    high speeds by avoiding adjacent typebars moving in close succession. This is
    possible through analysis of pair and triplet letter sequences, and ensuring that
    these letters come from different parts of the typebar array.\r\n\r\nIn a mechanical
    keyboard, the arms connecting the keys to the lever mechanism need to be offset,
    so that they don't interfere with each other; hence, the keys are offset. But
    note too that the typist's hands tend to be slightly angled inward, not perpendicular
    to the keyboard, so the offset keys are also ergonomically superior. For example,
    my right index finger resting over the J extends in a straight line to strike
    the U key.\r\n\r\nMost mobile device keyboards are two small and not responsive
    enough for touch-typing, so it probably doesn't matter much whether the keys are
    offset or not."

    :)\r\n\r\nNeither of these words convey the popularly-held-to-be-true, oft-repeated-without-fact-checking
    aspects of myth in the sense in which I used it. Of course there are different
    senses of the word myth, and if we were having a conversation about hero narratives
    their sense would be plain, as I believe mine was.\r\n\r\n<em>...the QWERTY layout
    was essentially a governor.</em>\r\n\r\nNo, the mechanics of the typebar system
    were a governing limitation. The keyboard layout maximised the opportunity for
    speed given that limitation. That is obviously quite different from deliberately
    slowing down the typist with a thousand faces, which is the, ahem, myth."

    can be too much of a good thing. Hands are highly adjustable and \u2014 \"A change

    one position and for people with the right size of  hands.  \r\n\r\nWe  have (for
    example) an ergonomically designed set of pruning shears. They are very comfortable
    to hold when held as intended, but uncomfortable, difficult to use and possibly
    dangerous if not held that way. When working in the garden, as you can imagine,
    you have to reach over, under and around things, so it is quite inconvenient and
    tiring not to be able to change your grip on the shears. Other ergonomically design
    tools have the same problem. The designers have imagined there is one right way
    to hold them and and that is that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    how mechanical typewriters are made.\r\n\r\nThe numeral and QWERTY rows are offset
    to one another so that the Q key is exactly halfway between the 1 and the 2 keys.
    Similarly, the ASDF and ZXC rows are offset so that Z is exactly halfway between
    A and S.\r\n\r\nThose two pairs of rows are then offset so that A is halfway between
    Q and 2.\r\n\r\nThis way, since on a typewriter each key is connected to a lever
    that continues forwards, these levers, starting under the center of each key,
    are separated by a constant 3/16ths of an inch, each one from the next.\r\n\r\nStarting
