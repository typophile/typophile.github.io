		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, my first bash at a critique - please bear with me.</p>
<p>Firstly, I like the simplicity and concept of the emblem, but I feel that the extrusion applied to the R is a little inconsistent. The mixture of 0°, 45° and 90° terminals are quirky, but could be better resolved. Also, the concentric curves look like they need to be better spaced - especially where the middle curve meets the leg of the R.</p>
<p>The font you&rsquo;ve used for your name is fine, but the kerning needs looking at - in particular, the &lsquo;an&rsquo; combinations in both words are too close together. I think you could increase the spacing of all the letters in &lsquo;Sloan&rsquo;, as the &lsquo;Rya&rsquo; combination necessitates more generous negative space.</p>
<p>As for the last line, and this is possibly a personal preference, I&rsquo;m just not a fan of that particular font - I find it far too dated, especially given the nature of the commodity it&rsquo;s advertising, and it does nothing to enhance the rest of the design. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any need to use a combination of fonts in this logo - you may find using Maven throught yields a better result.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Alaskan - I agree. Sound wave logos are everywhere. They are especially in my client&rsquo;s design brief, as he specifically asked for them. So there is nothing I can do about that. Although I did come up with several concepts that I felt adequately illustrated the concept of sound. Can you offer any alternatives?</p>
<p>@chr.s - Thanks for the helpful input. I chose Bank Gothic because it tends to be pretty legible at smaller sizes, for things like banner ads or business cards. However, I&rsquo;m not stuck on it by any means, and I&rsquo;m open to suggestions here. I will definitely post up a version that uses Maven for the tagline as well. Your kerning/tracking suggestions are spot on and I will make those changes as well.</p>
<p>Thanks again to both of you!
I also look forward to any other comments/critiques from other members</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I love the mark. Although people may find it overused, it makes the purpose of your business clear. You did make it your own with the negative space of the reversed &ldquo;R&rdquo;. A nice simple solve. Great job!</p>
<p>I will have to agree with chr.s that the use of Bank Gothic is a bit jarring. Besides the personal aversion (which I share), the larger issue is that you&rsquo;ve used 2 different sans serif fonts in the same context which breaks one of the fundamental rules of typography.</p>
<p>Good luck. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you stick with mark: Let the counter shadow continue all the way around the curve and thin it at the bottom. The current solution doesn&rsquo;t look right. Also make the sound waves equal in weight and perhaps try extending them so they line up at 90 degrees.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Frode - Can you narrow it down a little? I&rsquo;m learning now that Bank Gothic just may be disastrous in itself, that on top of using two different Sans fonts in the same mark. And the kerning, I will do my best to fix that. What else? I have been following the forums for a few weeks now, and you always seem to be spot on with your critiques/advice. I am open to suggestions!</p>
<p>@tbufano - Thanks for the kind words about the mark :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My English isn&rsquo;t all that good. I could show you a sketch of what I mean but then I would be the one designing and not you.</p>
<p>On the shadow: consider how it would look in real life. The inside counter wouldn&rsquo;t have a shadow that was cut off midways unless the counter had a very wierd shape.</p>
<p>On the sound waves: if they were the same weight as the shadow, I think they might look more like they belong (unless there&rsquo;s a reason why they have different weight). The waves are cut off by the leg in the bottom, and the same cut is mirrored in the top. That might work, but I would also try a vertical cut in the top just to see how it looks. It might help with the balance.</p>
<p>Bank Goth can look great used correctly. The problem with your pairing is the shapes don&rsquo;t belong stylistically. They are two different &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; mixed together for no apparent reason. And yes, that kerning is horrible ;)</p>
