    it, you might also try <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html\">Part
    11 (Everyday Hand Printing Fonts)</a> of the Script Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    Most of the fonts I show in Part 11 have appeared in commercial products, and
    therefore I thought they would be more freqently seen.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
