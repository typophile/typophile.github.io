  & Kramer for the Austrian Secessionist magazine "Ver Sacrum." It may have been produced
  by Poppelbaum -- at least Poppelbaum had a font called "ver sacrum": it was either
  the same type or a close copy. Is anyone familiar with it? Does anyone make a digital
  version?'

    for a start. Or aren''t you talking about the masthead? Another good reason for
    showing the sample. '

  body: 'Although it obviously isn''t what is being used here, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/benicia/">Parkinson''s
    Benicia</a> is similar. The blurb at the MyFonts page just linked includes some
    research hints. Not sure if they''re of much use. From them, I came across <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-jenson/">LTC Jenson</a>. Neither
    of these match the ''W'' from your scan. (The short tail of the ''Q'' also distinguishes
    your face from others. Edit: the ''G'' seems even more distinctive.)'

  body: "Tupper: thanks!\r\n\r\nNot an exact match, but LTC Jenson is pretty close
    -- and it, I learn, is based on William Morris's \"Golden Type\" of 1890, also
    a close match. This makes perfect sense, as Austria looked to England for much
    of its progressive design at the time. The Poppelbaum \"ver sacrum\" type was
    certainly just a local variation based on the Kelmscott original. I agree that
    the \"G\" is its distinguishing mark; I'm curious where that little spur came
    from -- I can't recall seeing anything like it."
