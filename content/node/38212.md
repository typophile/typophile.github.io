  question; I hope that's okay...\r\n\r\nI have to reproduce a brochure in another
  language; the english brochure has been supplied, and I'm puzzled over the choice
  of point sizes throughout. Would be grateful to know if someone here can detect
  any logic to this:\r\n\r\nType Point size/leading are as indicated across a six-panel
  brochure:\r\n\r\nPanel 1:\r\nSubhead 9.65/11\r\nBody: 9/11\r\nBody: 7.5/10\r\n\r\nPanel
  2:\r\nHead: 23.152/15\r\nBody: 9/10\r\nSubhead: 13.891/15.569\r\nBody: 8.489/10.804\r\nBody:
  8/9.5\r\nBody: 7.5/9\r\n\r\nPanel 3:\r\nSame as panel 2.\r\n\r\nPanel 4:\r\nSame
  as panels 2 and 3, with a little 9.65/11 and 9/11 thrown in.\r\n \r\nPanel 5:\r\nHead:
  17 pt.\r\nSubhead: 14/auto\r\nBody: 9.25/auto\r\n\r\nPanel 6:\r\nHead: 43.996/46.853\r\n\r\nOtherwise
  it's a well-designed brochure; am I just looking at sloppy typesetting?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Some of the odd sizes could come down to the fact that they designed it for
    a different size, were given new dimensions, and just shrunk the text to fit.
    But the randomness has no rhymne or reason. Is this for David Carson?

  body: Well designed? Maybe the general layout, but it must be a bit weird to read
    with that bizarre typesetting. I can't think of any logical, or even illogical,
    reason for the type sizes being all over the map either; just don't do that when
    you re-set it in the new language.

  body: "Heh. Sadly, no, it's not for a circus. And I don't know who David Carson
    is. But I suspect that MissTiffany is probably right about globally adjusting
    the type to accomodate a changed format or size. Yikes.\r\n\r\nThanks all for
    taking the time to respond. And yeah, I'll be standardizing the sizes in the next
    language version.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I remember Frank Romano bemoaning the flexibility of type sizes at a type
    conference in the 90s. He was thinking of spec'ing type from printed copies, and
    how difficult it would be to determine the size, if designers use tenths of a
    point sizes. And here you have 23.152 ... thousandths.\r\n\r\nI can just imagine
    trying to figure that one out with a type gauge."

  body: I suspect that what they did was set everything at some size and leading,
    and then scale things by percentage--maybe one item at a time, but maybe the whole
    piece, one "page" at a time.
