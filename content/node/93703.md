body: Thanks to David Berlow for leaving the Vineyard long enough to enlighten and
  entertain us at the NYC TDC.  The day flew by, we came we saw, we got some hints
  about web type. And a good time was had by all.  Special thanks to Carol Wahler
  for running a smoothe sailing event, and to Nick Sherman for doing all that keeky
  stuff!
