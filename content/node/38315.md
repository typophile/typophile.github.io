  the back of these postcards, and hoped for something along the lines. I was thinking
  of using Blair, however, any others would help. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for
  your time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: A few that come to mind are Gotham, AT Sackers Gothic, and Engravers Gothic,
    which would look similar with some distressing. Might want to look at Landry Gothic
    over at http://www.ahleman.com/fonts/fontindex.html.
