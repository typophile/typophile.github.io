body: "Hi,\r\nI'm looking for a higly legible face (not for continuous text), for
  a use in the logo for an accessibility guide. The face must have a range of weights
  (including semi-bold) and present well in display sizes. It must also use \"true
  forms\", i.e. it's alphabet must be based firmly on the written alphabet, geometric
  but with well structed letters, something like Sassoon Primary without the slope,
  but not oblique -- bare in mind its for adults with learning difficulties. Can anyone
  recommend a suitable face? "
