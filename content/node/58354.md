  typeface is Microsofts Consolas.\r\n\r\nIt has been cut - subtle..\r\n\r\nAttached
  is the original logotype and my designs.\r\n\r\nI am liking 3.1 and 4 most. I've
  added perspective to 3.3 and 3.4\r\n\r\nI would like feedback on:\r\n\r\n\u2022
  the cut directions (3.1 has variations - 4s cuts are all in the same direction),\r\n\r\n\u2022
  if you think adding perspective looks good, and\r\n\r\n\u2022 anything else you
  want to add\r\n\r\n\r\nI appreciate your help, thank you in advance.\r\n\r\nWith
  kind regards,\r\n\r\nVictor[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EeePC_logotype_1_3964.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EeePC_logotype_2_3600.jpg]"
