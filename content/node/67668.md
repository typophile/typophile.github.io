  body: yeah I actually like the combination of farnahm for body and mercury for titling.
    Also caslon looks nice for callouts. What do you guys think about caslon and mercury
    . Sounds fishy but it actually looks good!

  body: "The convention is usually to avoid mixing similar styles. If the weights
    are different enough, or the style details are not similar, then I think it's
    easier to do without making it look like you made a mistake and mixed them unintentionally.\r\n\r\n-
