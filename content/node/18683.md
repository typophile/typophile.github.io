  but I am posting some packaging options for a Gourmet coffee.  It is very high-end,
  from Puerto Rico (Map).  The name Platino means Platinum."

    3 (from left). I think the strongest is 4.\r\n\r\nGreat use of rich colors. \r\n\r\n"

  body: One problem, for me, with 3 is that the logos almost look too similar and
    then they appear repeated. However, I do like that much of the silver showing.
    Maybe re-visit that option and figure in a little more assymetry.

    coffee beans at some stage of the productions are a light ochre, aren't they?).\r\n\r\nThe
    left-most example is my favorite. If you want color, I recommend something in
    the direction of number 3."

  body: 'My problem with these designs aren''t with the look as much as how they will
    stack up against other Gourmet Coffees. Did you get competing brands and see what
    they were doing? Did you do shelf space testing? Will your brand jump out to consumers
    or will it fade into the background when its in a commercial enviroment? I will
    suggest the name is to subtitle and needs to be bumped up (size) and you might
    want to make some of the important information with more contrast. My suggestions
    have nothing to do with design but with sales.  '

  body: "If you go with #4, then the 3-bean cluster needs to go. You already have
    a pic of beans. It is repetitive. \r\n\r\nThe burgundy box that has the 100 percent
    logo- put the map in it. Move 100% logo somewhere it doesn't compete so much with
    the main logo. Maybe below the coffee mug."

  body: The problem I have with the first one is the image just ends. No rhymne. No
    reason. Lack of ink does not equal high end, necessarily.

  body: 'I agree that if the ink could fade out properly it would be much stronger.
    The cluster above the logo needs to be rearranged. It may not be neccessary. #1
    has the most potential in my opinion.'

  body: "With limited knowledge of your market and its competitors I can only speak
    to the packages presented and my knowledge of the NZ coffee market. #1 seems to
    work best of the four options due to its simplicity and restraint. The limited
    colour palate assists with the idea that the name portraits (platinum) by allowing
    so much use of this silver packaging base layer. Move the bean cluster up slightly
    so that it does not cramp the blend bar so much. The brand mark needs more dominance,
    the 100% logo needs less. \r\n\r\nThe burgundy bar and yellow screen of #2 seems
    to restrict the map too much and fails to let it breathe and use the space like
    it does in #1. \r\n\r\n#4 is far too cluttered and this complex grid offers little
    to the idea of sophistication or high end. \r\n\r\n#3 has potential but lacks
    some of the sophistication and clean lines of #1.\r\n\r\nBest.\r\n-nic"

  body: "Thanks to all.  The feedback is greatly appreciated.  \r\n\r\nDan, in the
    beginning the coffee will be sold locally and there is no packaging like this
    on the Island.  No tests have been done at the international level, however due
    to the fact that Puerto Rico has to import coffee to supply the local demand,
    international retail sales are not the main objective.  \r\n\r\nChris, I found
    two online retailers http://www.demiislita.com/cafe_us.html and http://www.ebay.com...
    look for Encantos.  \r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nEdgardo"

  body: "Number 1 is really nice, the bean cluster really disrupts the background
    image though, I'd consider moving it or removing it all together. Also the logo
    seems too cramped vertically, let it breathe a bit and add increase the height
    of the black box. I'm not sure what the top insignia is; but one thing to consider
    is that once the package is open and the customer rolls it down that will most
    likely be lost in the fold; so if it's important even moving it down 1/2 an inch
    might be worth it.\r\n\r\nI can see where the color for the map in #2 came from
    and I like it as well. Again the logo should have a bit more room and the 100%
    is tight to the bottom, I'd move it up a tad. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
