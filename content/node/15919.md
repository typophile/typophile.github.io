body: "I need to design a novel. It\u2019s hardboiled detective fiction, contemporary,
  with a strong nostalgic tinge but not retro in way that\u2019s arch or jokey. It
  is also a bit quirky, not straight-ahead tough guy standard fare. Literary. I want
  something strong and lean but with that hint of suppleness even whimsy. I am looking
  at Filosofia but see that people have their doubts about it as a text face, though
  using InDesign it looks pretty good."

    King's latest book? I love the retro feel of the cover! And this is also King's
    first detective novel.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0843955848.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpeg]"

  body: "I was looking at some news faces but they\u2019re a bit sobersided. Paperback\u2019s
    closer to what I had in mind, but I\u2019m not sure if it works with my budget.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the feedback, all. There are actually several pulp revival presses operating
    right now... one is even putting those great \u201Cmapback\u201D covers on their
    paperbacks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Just a personal take on this, but both Filosofia and Zocalo seem a little
    pinched to me for hard-boiled detective fiction. I think of that genre as looser
    than that, and I would look at wider faces with a smaller number of characters
    per pica. And I would stay away from faces that have a big thick/thin contrast
    (these hard-boiled guys are heavy, right?). Sorry I don''t have a specific suggestion
    (something like a Caslon maybe?).  '
