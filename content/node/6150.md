  body: There may be genuine variations in the stroke thicknesses, depending on your
    drawing program and how you&#39;re keeping consistent stroke thicknesses. Also,
    since it isn&#39;t a font yet, it is unhinted, so you&#39;ve got the random factor
    of how it will round to the rasterization grid of the output device &#40;printer&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>To do small size samples, you&#39;ll want to move it into a real font
    editing program, and have it hinted. Of course, these days there are only a few
    of us who will recommend Fontographer. If you&#39;re on a budget, consider TypeTool.
    Otherwise, look at FontLab or perhaps DTL FontMaster if you&#39;re doing full-time
    font production. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T
