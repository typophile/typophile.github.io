    \ we all pool our money together and hire a good designer, who will then not be
    paid and the CEO gets paid a bonus to randomly pick a knock-off font which we
    can pay again to have someone fix.\r\n\r\nAre you doing the web work for free
    for this company?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "An investment company willing to go with a cheap or free knock-off as opposed
    to investing in their own identity? That doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Be
    very, very careful there TweakingKnobs - that doesn't sound like a good client.\r\n\r\nBut
    as to your question: maybe try <b>[[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium|Gentium]]</b>
    - it's a relatively nice, \"classical\" looking serif. "

  body: "TK, you might want to start by asking yourself \"is anything that's free
    have any quality?\" The same question could be asked about your services to them
    as a client. (Edit: Yes, there are many free typefaces out there that have lots
    of quality!)\r\n\r\nIf they're serious about investing (and business in general),
    then they'll surely understand that investing in a quality typeface will get them
    much further than a free one.\r\n\r\nAs far as suggestions go: It would be hard
    for anyone to know what typeface is suitable for their company, without having
    a deep understand for their business goals and their customers goals.\r\n\r\nGet
    to know them, and get to know type. I recommend reading Ellen Lupton's Thinking
    with Type: http://www.papress.com/thinkingwithtype/ You can probably grab a copy
    from your local library (which would be free). It's an easy read, with plenty
    of food for thought."

  body: "Thanx for the replies , but you didnt actually answer my question just bemerx25
    \ did and i totally dont like that font.\r\n\r\nthe company is acctualy my mother
    and his friend,is not a big enterprise with lots of money , the designer is me
    , yes i will not charge her , most of the people dont see the difference between
    helvetica and arial as an example that a good free font will do the job.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo
    please just guide me in what kind of font is good for this purpose , a thin one
    a bold one, a serif a sans i dont know about typefaces and how to use them , i
    like futura extra bold,helvetica,avantgarde and frakfurter for example , but i
    dont know what kind should i use for this purpose.\r\n\r\nPlease guide me to what
    kind of font i should choose, comertial or free.\r\n\r\nthanx"

  body: "TK,\r\n\r\nPerhaps you should see what other investment groups use for their
    identity. Think about what kind of message their type choices communicate and
    use this research as a baseline for exploring what typeface would work best for
    your mother's company. \r\n\r\nI don't really have any suggestions because right
    now the design problem is fairly vague - an investment company that doesn't appear
    to have a niche (what are they focused on investing in? who are they trying to
    serve?), I don't know what kind of audience they're looking for (who's going to
    use them? and why?), and I certainly don't know the people behind this company.
    \r\n\r\nDefining or answering these questions may help you have a better idea
    of what kind of typeface you're looking for - and then I might be able to help
    you more."

    answering those questions will help you form a more informed opinion. As well
    reading up on the history of typography. A brief background would do you a lot
    of good at this point.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJason R.\r\nwww.jasonrobb.com"

    on Wall Street are saying too :)\r\n\r\nSeriously though TK, the question is crazy.
    You cannot pick a typeface with no understanding of what it is for except \"investing\".
    Even if by chance, we happened to give you the perfect typeface, without any knowledge
    of typography you will probably put it to poor use.\r\n\r\nYou cannot build a

  body: "TK, the advice to do some homework so that you are equipped to make these
    types of decisions on your own is sound. It's what will make you a serviceable
    designer, leave alone great for the time being. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, here
    is a little (general) advice based on experience: \r\nInvestment firms and law
    firms are two of the most conservative categories of client you will come across.
    They often look to convey trustworthiness and a penchant for winning with their
    communications. Friendliness and client focus are secondary elements to these
    types of brands. Contrast that with a personal banking service, who prefer to
    appear helpful and approachable. Investment and law firms are hired to be bulldogs.
    Typically, you want austere, conservative and traditional imagery that doesn't
    shout. \r\n\r\nBut only your mother and her partner can say if the above is appropriate
    to their business.\r\n\r\nAs for free fonts, have a look at Fontin Sans by Jos
    Buivenga. "
