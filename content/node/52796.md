    font.

  body: Seems the backward D is likely to be a problem. It works when there's enough
    context, but people will read it as O or A in a lot of situations.

  body: "It reminds me of tree rings and rock paintings mixed together. I like the
    organic look, it's fun.\r\n\r\nI couldn't read the D though so that may need rethinking.\r\n\r\nAre
    the two colours going to be separate fonts overlaid? "

  body: "I thought the font was going to get trashed in this critique, which when
    constructive isn't always a bad thing.  However, I'm pleased with some of the
    impressions you guys are receiving. \r\n\r\nIn concerns with the backward D, I
    agree and have made the changes to reverse it. \r\n\r\nTo Bendy: The two fonts
    are going to be as one. I've never seen a font that was constructed like that
    and I think it was part of what drew me to making the complete letter set.  I
    enjoy this font but I'm unsure what I am going to do with it as of right now,
    it kind of feels like a wild animal.\r\n\r\nOne thing for sure is I'm going to
    touch up some of the inside portions of the letters a little and play around with
    the M and the W a little more."

  body: "I think Bendy was getting at the technical challenges involved in making
    multicolor fonts. As far as I'm aware, the available options are to either make
    them as vector clip art, in PS Type 3 font format (which is a largely obsolete
    format, for which tools and compatibility are limited), or make a separate font
    for each color with the same spacing and overlay them in use. That sort of layered
    font set has been done before, but for the moment I'm blanking on the names\r\n\r\nI
    love what you've done with the thing, though. What a fun poster!"
