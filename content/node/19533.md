body: "First of all please excuse me if this is a repost of sorts, I've searched quite
  extensivley on the topic, but need some additional help...\r\n\r\nThe design studio
  I work for had a freelancer design some cover art. She ended up using a font found
  in the user library (OSX) \"Goudy Old Face\" an [[FFIL]] font. When we sent the
  layered art to the press, they called me up and said Goudy Old Face was only a screen
  font, thus no good.\r\n\r\nI searched through my fonts and could not find a Goudy
  Old Face [[LWFN]] version? So I ended up having to purchase the post scripts for
  the font and just sent those off.\r\n\r\nSo here is my question... \r\n\r\nIf I
  only see a FFIL suitcase listed in my \"User/Library\", how do I know it has a printer
  (LWFN) font?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is, all of the FFIL fonts in my \"User/Library\"
  do not have any visible LWFNs? Which leads me to believe these FFIL files are worthless
  without their LWFN counterparts.\r\n\r\nI found this FFIL to DFONT converter, but
  I'm not sure making DFONT's out of my FFIL's is even going to do anything other
  than changing the wrapper?\r\n\r\nShould I just go into my \"User/Library\" and
  remove all of the FFIL fonts to prevent this in the future?\r\n\r\nThanks for any
  help!\r\n- e"

    at all if the LWFN file was missing. If all you have is the FFIL (a.k.a. the font
    suitcase), and you put this into one of your Font directories, OS X will not show
    the font in your font menus. \r\n\r\nIt's not likely to have a name like \"Goudy
    Old Face\", more likely something like \"GoudyOldFac\". PostScript font file names
    are usually shortened and must contain no spaces."

    I had to be made into a disk image because of the whole losing the fork thing.
    \r\n\r\nMark, do you think the font lost its postscript because of the way I tried
    to send it over?\r\n\r\nI wonder if sending over the converted dfont would have
    differnt results?"

  body: The resource fork issue affects the FFIL file, not LWFNs. A FFIL file (font
    suitcase) has all its information in the resource fork. Only Macs can deal properly
    with this kind of file. The LWFN (the PostScript outline data) has all its information
    in the data fork, meaning it's just a plain old binary file, like the kind used
    on other OS's. If you are not careful when moving Mac font suitcases (FFILs) to
    and from foreign file systems (the internet, for example), the resource fork may
    be lost resulting in an empty (0kb) file.

  body: Incidentally, a dfont is simply a Mac TrueType font with all its data in the
    data fork instead of the resource fork. Apple uses this format for essential system
    fonts on OS X because OS X is UNIX-based and, without higher level stuff like
    Aqua, can't deal with resource forks either. There is no need or advantage to
    converting normal (non-system-essential) fonts to the dfont format.

    meant it is originally MADE and optimized for the screen, not that it is a SCREEN
    FONT made out of pixels. So there's no need to look for a PostScript version of
    it. Everything is in the FFIL file. \r\nIf you're happy with the design just tell
    them to use it. It's an old myth that TrueType fonts are not printable. Every
    recent RIP or printer will have no problems using this TrueType font in a font
    suitcase.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.info"

  body: Good point. It didn't occur to me that there could be a TrueType font in the
    FFIL. That would certainly explain why the font was usable yet didn't have a corresponding
    LWFN file. I simply assumed from the problem description that it was a PostScript
    font. D'oh!

  body: "There seems to be some confusion here. Rather than reply to any specific
    post, I'm going to state things as I understand them. \r\n\r\nThe FFIL file is
    what is traditionally know as a Mac font suitcase. In OS 9 and before it generally
    had a suitcase icon. In the case of a Postscript Type 1 font, there needs to be
    a LWFN paired with it; this is the Postscript Type 1 Outline. \r\n\r\nAnother
    common situation is that the font is a traditional Mac TrueType font. It has the
    outlines contained in the same file as the Suitcase. There is no obvious way to
    tell using only the Finder. It does not need to have a .dfont or .ttf extension,
    and does indeed store critical data in the resource fork. If you add the font
    to a font manager, you should be able to determine quickly that it is TT. \r\n\r\nIf
    a PostScript font suitcase is missing it's outline, it may sometimes be refered
    to as 'bitmap only' or an 'orphan'. In some applications, these faces may still
    be available, typically you will get a warning if you try to print them. This
    situation exists for backwards compatability with certain applications. \r\n\r\nIf
    you work in a prepress environment, you may occasionally come across ancient fonts
    intended to be bitmap only. These exotic beauties were either intended for screen-only
    use or for dot matrix printers.(remember those?) Nowdays Mac OS doesn't use the
    old bitmap components that are present in the suitcase, but the suitcase file
    still needs to be intact. \r\n\r\nThis may be in the wiki..."

    \r\nAlso, in Suitcase Fusion these fonts may appear with either a green \"O\"
    or a blue \"A\" icon depending on their characteristics. This is partly because
    OpenType and TrueType are part of the same standard. The fonts in this image are
    provided with Microsoft Office.\r\n"
