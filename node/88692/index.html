		<div class="commentbody">Hello Dick,
I like to believe that Typophile is not about type design only, but about all things typographic (and even beyond), which definitely includes book design. There are quite a few book designers on Typophile, and you can <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com/node/%20%22book%20design%22">find many threads</a> that focus on various aspects of book design, from rather mundane and technical, to downright philosophical. I’d like to encourage you to start your own threads on the things you wish to discuss, here on Typophile. There is <a href="http://typophile.com/forums">no special forum</a> dedicated to book design yet, but that can be changed, if enough people think that this is necessary.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I hear you about LinkedIn and Facebook, but they serve certain niche areas of my life and I tend to engage in social media just about only when I&rsquo;m working. I&rsquo;ll keep them handy on the second monitor in case I&rsquo;m working at an odd hour and need the sense that there are other humans around at that particular hour. As for book design people to speak with, it&rsquo;s true that a good many can be found on Typophile when a thread raises them. And you&rsquo;ll find them in various publishing-related Yahoo Groups, on a number of freelancers forums, as well as in LinkedIn groups. I occasionally get some, tho' nowhere near as many as I&rsquo;d like, commenting on my blog about book design. I think it&rsquo;s all about putting together the best combo of connections in as many places online as possible for running into those kinds of discussions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Florian &amp; Steve for taking the trouble to persuade me. My comment re LinkedIn &amp; Facebook came across maybe more scathing than intended! Perhaps book designers are in the minority of type users, and that may explain why the subject has less representation here than I expected. But I&rsquo;ll hang about and chip in what I can here, also it&rsquo;s good to find your blog Steve. I suppose I&rsquo;m a bit odd in not being a designer by trade but a one-man-band publisher whose resources mandate a DIY approach to design, which I have always had an interest in. I&rsquo;m interested in trends in short-run book production &amp; fairly direct marketing also, as I believe these represent the future of non-mass-market publishing given the way the book trade has gone in recent years.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I&rsquo;ll say this, Dick, a lot of DIY books look it. And that leads to a kind of vicious cycle, as&ndash;unless the book is to a sort of &ldquo;captive audience,&rdquo; like students needing a particular textbook&ndash;potential readers become less and less willing to part with their hard-to-come-by dollars. So book design really matters, in my estimation.</p>
<p>If you start a group for book designers somewhere, please let me know.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m with you there Steve; the availability of software and now POD has cluttered the world with a lot of junk. The financial barrier to conventional volume production for trade sale, as with all forms of &lsquo;recorded&rsquo; media, ensures a measure of editorial control, although you have to wonder about that sometimes lately. I&rsquo;m in between those extremes - I sell mainly direct, but having to print a minimum of 100 to get the physical quality I&rsquo;m after keeps me focussed on the merits and look of the material to be sure, as that expenditure is big for me. I have used POD for club work in the past where the original material was rough to begin with and so the results acceptable, but on cost and quality grounds, and because of the lack of available detailing, I wouldn&rsquo;t use it for my own projects.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi there, I&rsquo;ve been designing books for a small local publishing house in the very last years. I proposed myself after seeing some very poor quality laying around and, as a typography and book lover, I&rsquo;ve been conceited enough to think that even a small publisher deserves a good look. That also gave me the chance to buy and use some great contemporary fonts - from Sumner Stone&rsquo;s Cycles and Magma to Kent Lew&rsquo;s Whitman, from Type Together&rsquo;s Athelas to Robert Slimbach&rsquo;s Adobe Garamond, and more. It&rsquo;s a very limited experience, not &ldquo;professional&rdquo; in the very strict sense of the word (I&rsquo;m a journalist and self made designer), but I have the presumption to think that, in the end, the looks of their book has improved. Now I&rsquo;m also editing, and typesetting as well, a series of books, mainly out of print / copyright free stuff. As for the matter of (digital) print on demand versus offset printing, I think that the greater quality difference is in the binding - sewing is still much better than milling. There are some other people in Typophile involved in book design - Charles Ellertson and Kent Lew come to mind.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Nicola, You&rsquo;re right that binding is generally where POD falls down. There is a &lsquo;middle way&rsquo; between &lsquo;milled&rsquo; (is that what some call &lsquo;perfect&rsquo;?) and sewn binding, namely so-called slotted or &lsquo;burst&rsquo; binding, where the pages are assembled in folded signatures, but instead of being sewn, saw-cuts are made across the spines of the signatures and some sort of heated plastic or glue is injected. This is probably stronger than sewn, will not come apart or go slack in use, but of course will not quite lay open and flat as a sewn book will (so I don&rsquo;t do cook-books and car repair manuals&hellip;) and cannot be re-bound, not that I can see this ever being needed. It&rsquo;s all a compromise.</p>
<p>My excellent digital printer in the UK (min run is 100 but will reprint down to 50) offers this as standard, but will sew on request at an additional cost of about 1-2 GBP per copy. My material does not really merit the expense of sewing, as this would up the selling price by somewhat more than the extra cost if I am being businesslike. But &lsquo;slotted&rsquo; is a better binding than the perfect type which most trade hardcover books seem to get these days, often concealed with a head &amp; tail band. The other goodies which you don&rsquo;t generally get with POD are printed endpapers, front cover blocking, sections of plates, etc., and of course proper rounding and backing of the spine, all of which I use and like, as do my trad-minded customers (I reissue neglected writers in the field of traditional sail).</p>
<p>My printer is called [[http://www.biddles.co.uk|Biddles]], and beside them being very competitive price-wise, their materials and quality are quite superb (they are an old-established company) and they have the most incredible DIY online estimating and job-submission system which handles all of those options you might need, and saves a huge amount of time as you adjust details and recalculate the cost. And they also do litho using the same materials and binding line, in case one of my titles &lsquo;takes off&rsquo; (hasn&rsquo;t happened yet though).</p>
<p>But digital printing technology is changing rapidly and I have to stay aware of their &lsquo;plant list&rsquo;, as which machine they use depends on the page size, and at larger sizes (where they use new Kodak &lsquo;Prosper&rsquo; inkjet technology) I have found the black density is a bit washed-out compared to the smaller formats (Nipson Varypress laser technology, nice &amp; dense text). Also at larger sizes they use so-called &lsquo;PUR&rsquo; binding, which is an absolutely bulletproof (but I suspect non-recyclable) single-page binding involving a flexible poly-something-or-other membrane holding the pages together. I&rsquo;m less hung-up about that than I thought I would be, having had a couple of books done with it, I tend to use head &amp; tail bands on larger sizes, so no-one would ever really know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inevitable that sewn binding for short runs will soon be unavailable except at the &lsquo;collector&rsquo; end of the market, where I don&rsquo;t operate (as far as I know, anyway, although one dealer did advertise one of my titles at 6 times the original price, before realising it was &ndash; and is &ndash; still available from me).</p>
<p>Another inevitability about short-run digital is, the letterforms are almost too smooth &amp; perfect, and the paper too smooth. I miss that &lsquo;earthy&rsquo; almost 3-D feel you get with old letterpress books, even in ordinary trade editions.</p>
<p>I liked your thread on nice books you own, I&rsquo;m not sure I own anything in that league, but will see what I can find. I have a soft spot for nicely done ordinary trade books.</p>
<p>PS - Sorry this was so long!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been setting books (only) for 30+ years, and designing, occasionally, for most of that time. I can sum up what I&rsquo;ve learned in a few paragraphs. Here&rsquo;s the short form. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>You can only judge a book typeface by looking at ink on paper. The method used to get the ink on paper matters a lot. The particular paper matters a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m less concerned with letter forms &ndash; within reason &ndash; than with space. All spaces interact. Fashions come and go (e.g. we&rsquo;re into using a lot of leading now), but the interaction of space remains a constant.</p>
<p>The smallest of these. character fit, usually lies outside the control of the designer, and all to often, the typesetter. Learn how to take control. Write a good kerning program. That&rsquo;s several days initial work, corrected when you see books printed at 2400 dpi, offset, direct to plate (if that&rsquo;s how the books you work on are printed). Character fit lets you have more control over the word boundaries. Pay special attention to punctuation, type designers screw this up by the numbers. As the look of the line improves, so will the leading. You will find that more than one leading value works well. Etc.</p>
<p>Consider the audience. Designing a book is no place for what <em>you</em> like. If you want to favor what you like, write your own book. People too often equate book interior design to architecture. Well, there is that element. But don&rsquo;t forget a more humble comparison, a theatrical set designer. The egos of of a whole lot of people have to be served with set design, as well as the interests of the playwright and audience.</p>
<p>The best books on book design are descriptive, not prescriptive. My favorite is the <cite>Art of the Printed Book, 1455-1955</cite>. Figure out why particular books were selected. (hint: it isn&rsquo;t particularly for the typefaces chosen). Rich Hendel&rsquo;s <cite>On Book Design</cite> is good. Rich has a second book forthcoming. Shameless plug, I admire Rich, and have a chapter in the new book, as does Kent Lew.</p>
<p>It seems to be a long, slow process, learning good interior design. Cover design is a whole different matter, and perhaps more satisfying for a number of people. Different talents required.</p>
