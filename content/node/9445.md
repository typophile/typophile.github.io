  body: This appears to be a custom job, but <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-century/bold-condensed/"
    target="_blank">ITC Century Bold Condensed</a> would be close.

  body: If you jack up the x-height, add the swash and shadow, yes, it would be. The
    underlying letterforms are similar. What I&#39;m saying is that I don&#39;t think
    there is a font that will match this exactly, that it was custom drawn as a logo.
