  body: my mother, who teaches 3rd grade, has been using fonts from <a href="http://www.schoolhousefonts.com/">schoolhouse
    fonts</a> for over a decade. The best part about these fonts is that they come
    with a little application that links all the letters correctly--kinda like OpenType,
    but this little app can run within MS Word. My mom prints out all her kids' names
    each year and puts them at the top of their desks so that they can see how to
    write it out in cursive properly. I higly recommend these fonts.
