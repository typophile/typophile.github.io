body: I'm doing something for a traditional Irish band, so I'm looking for some sort
  of a gaelic looking typeface to set headlines in. Does anyone know of any thing
  that might work? Extra points if it's an Uncial face.

  body: "<cite>what is the typeface?</cite>\r\n\r\nYou may wonder or not, it\u2019s
    \u2013 Andron.\r\nSorry for the missing accent. The fonts do have accented letters,
    of course.\r\nThe image is from a type specimen I did a few years ago.\r\n"

  body: "Seo Tae,\r\nplease stop posting your translation requests. This thread is
    about Iris/Gaelic typefaces. This forum is about type and typography.\r\nAs <a
    href=\"http://typophile.com/node/61919#comment-393201\">Ken Lunde said</a>, \u201Cthere
    is a massive difference between 1) asking someone, or a group, to translate and/or
    transliterate text from one language to another as a one-time or one-off request,
    and 2) doing what you're doing, which clearly amounts to significant work or effort,
    and is thus extraordinarily unreasonable and incredibly inappropriate.\u201D\r\nFurther
    attempts, here, in the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/61919\">other thread</a>
    or anywhere else will be treated as spam, and deleted.\r\nThank you,\r\nF"
