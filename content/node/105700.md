  love to hear everyones opinion on it, especially the center as I feel like the cupcake
  gets lost? Maybe I should make the lines of the cupcake more heavy to anchor it
  into the design? \r\n\r\nLink : http://i43.tinypic.com/16k9t7l.png"

    \xB7 Cupcakes\u203A is way too small, and the separation of \u2039Baked\u203A
    and \u2039goods\u203A is confusing. It doesn\u2019t seem suited for use at a small
    size, some elements are hard to notice even on my screen (the dotted outlined
    circle)."

    maybe it should be next to the cupcake. Thanks for the advice on the type! Will
    work on that! Anymore comments? '

    this whole thing. The text is poorly rendered, the stars are poorly rendered,
    the fine line segments which is meant to connect those elements isn't even of
    the same radius ...even it's poorly rendered. The cake part of the cupcake looks
    like a turd and gets lost in the background color. Those branches whatever are
    incredibly lame.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing distinctive in this 'logo' worth paying
    for ...except of course how poorly it's designed.\r\n\r\nBut I kinda like the
    color palette ..."

    the bakery's name \u2014 are getting lost. And some elements like the bottom type
    and that dotted line are going to disappear when the logo is reproduced small.
    Simplify and work on improving the proportions.\r\n\r\nAnd unless the client requests
    it, I'd avoid using wheat as a decorative element because there's a growing interest
    in gluten-free products. Even if the bakery doesn't do gluten-free now, they might
    in the future.\r\n\r\n"
