body: "My recently released font \"Octant\"  is listed on MyFonts' \"Recent Fonts\"
  page, but it never appears on the MyFonts front page in the \"Recent Fonts\" column.
  I've refreshed the page dozens of times, and have seen other fonts that were released
  at the same time as Octant show up regularly (e.g., Sjiq). I've asked MyFonts about
  this, and they said a font has to be \"web-enabled\" to appear on the home page.
  \r\nHow do I web-enable my font?! Any ideas? Is that a matter on MyFonts' side,
  or on mine?\r\n\r\nI've already asked MyFonts, but they haven't responded yet. There
  are already 30 fonts that appeared after Octant since its release; if this reaches
  50, it will no longer be a \"Recent Font\" and my opportunities to get some exposure
  on the home page will be over.  >:("

  body: Your font is only available for standard 'Desktop' licensing/usage as opposed
    to having the option to license it for web font usage as well. If you look under
    'Buying Choices' for Slapjack for example, it is available for both 'Desktop'
    and 'Web Font' usage. I can only assume that this is what they mean...

  body: Yeah, I think that's what it means. But how can I make Octant available for
    web use? I don't suppose it's something I need to change about the OTF file?

  body: "Generating web font versions can be achieved in a number of ways. Font Squirrel
    offer a free online service which has a certain level of customisation but I would
    highly recommend testing the resulting formats before releasing them commercially.
    [[http://typophile.com/node/99688|FontLab have just released a beta version of
    Trans Type 4]] which has the ability to create web fonts, well WOFF and EOT anyway.
    FontForge is able to generate both WOFF and SVG fonts. Birdfont can generate both
    EOT and SVG fonts. There are also command line tools that can be set up to generate
    these formats and the page linked to below within the MyFonts site may help point
    you in the right direction:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webfonts.info/node/382"

  body: "Hi Karl,\r\n\r\nthanks for your information!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I got a reply
    from MyFonts. It seems I just have to fill in an online addendum to my contract
    in order to make my fonts available as webfonts. I have done that now, so I'm
    hoping the issue should be resolved soon..."
