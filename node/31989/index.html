  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hello.
alright, i'm a bit stuck in indesign. i have a paragraph style setup with a typeface that only includes three ligatures. it's alternates are in another font (which i also have), but i can't figure out how to reference the alternates without doing it by hand (and this would be insane to do by hand for large bodies of copy). is it possible to setup a style that will refer to the alternates for ligatures that aren't included in the existing one? 
for instance: style 1, font 1. includes "fi" and "fl". when "ff" or "fj" come up, can it refer to style 2 (without doing it manually), or is there a setting that can pull up font 2 (automatically).

thank you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wish there was a way to do this, but as far as I know, there's no way. This is why OpenType fonts are so terrific; they do this automatically. If you know how to code, you might be able to write a script to do a big find/replace whenever you want, but Tiffany's manual method is probably the easiest.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, but isn't that dependent on what ligatures the system fonts have? For example, you can't plop a "contextual" st ligature in the dialogue box in Find/Change as far as I know.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nowadays expert fonts are really a bad thing. Spellchecking won't work anymore, a change of typeface would mess up the whole document and so on.
Did your already checked whether your font is also available as OpenType?

		<div class="commentbody">Well, if you've paid for the two fonts (base + alternates) and have FontLab, I think in principle there's no reason why you can't create an OpenType font with all the desired automatic substitution routines. 

You'd have to check the EULA and see if this type of modification is permissible, but to my mind there's absolutely nothing unethical about it, especially if it's for your own private use. You're not distorting the face, you're not re-selling it; you're just trying to make your own life easier using the exact same glyphs, fitting etc that you paid for.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Terry, actually, I think you sort of can plop an st lig into find/replace. I do it with H&FJ's Mercury when trying to add in some of the ligatures that I don't believe are normally integrated. When I copy and paste, for example, an ffi lig into the find/replace box, it comes up as another character (omega is one I've seen often). When I replace all ffi's with omegas, it does just what I want -- probably because Mercury lacks an omega glyph, so the ffi takes its place. But if you were referring to OpenType contextual ligs, then that's another story -- find/replace won't help unless you use it to replace the inputted characters' OpenType formatting with ligatures on or off.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well that's good to know. One of the headaches that comes up when you try to place a contextual lig from an expert set into your standard set. (But that's Type 1 and True Type only.) I've gotten to a point where I don't even fool with Type 1 fonts anymore. These days if it ain't OpenType I don't bother.</div>
