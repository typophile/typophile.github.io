  body: Not a perfect match, but very similar in proportion would be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/sackers-antique-roman/|ATSackers
    Solid Antique Roman]] or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/solid-antique-roman/|Monotype
    Solid Antique Roman]]

    wouldnt tell me :(  If anyone else has any others that are very close please let
    me know!

  body: "Aren't these letters that have been cut from wood on a jig-saw? Do you know
    whether there is a complete alphabet? I ask this, because it's possible that these
    were custom made for this one name. Even if there were a full alphabet, the 'font'
    may have been a set of templates from which to cut the letters, and not anything
    like a digital font for your desktop. (My daughter bought a set of letters for
    her daughter's name -- not the same design -- and they were evidently made on
    a jig-saw, cut following patterns.)\r\n\r\nFor something with a similar feel,
    this reminds me of Ray Larbie's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/jillsville/\">Jillsville</a>.
    If you replaced the slab serifs with ball terminals (which I'd guess was done
    to make cutting the pieces easier), the look would be similar, I think.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Yes they do have the full alphabet, and its sold at 2-3 different retailers
    which is why i thought maybe they probably just had a font, typed it into the
    computer, and let the wood cut, such as many engraving companys do. I tried to
    email 2 of the sites, 1 had no clue as they said they personally do not make the
    letters. And the other said they could not give me the information i wanted. I
    cant get ahold of the 3rd site :(  But tyvm for finding one close as well.
