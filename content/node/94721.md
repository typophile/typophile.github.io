body: "Going to ATypI in Hong Kong this year? Eben Sorkin and I have booked 7 nights
  at US$260/night total for a twin room at a deluxe 5 star hotel with a gym, pool,
  etc. Following my remit to encourage sharing and be absurdly cheap, I'm hoping to
  share the room and split the cost further. If you're interested, email us - dave@understandingfonts.com
