body: "I'm in the midst of digitizing, on a PC, an old Art Nouveau typeface. I wish
  to share this with a Mac user on OS X 10.3.9.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that OS
  X users can use Win TT fonts just fine. Several online resources confirm this and
  I've forwarded to her the directions for properly installing the font that these
  resources advise.\r\n\r\nNo luck. She states that her \"computer acknowledges it
  but displays only a few rectangles.\" (the notdef glyph, I presume). She also finds
  that the font works perfectly on her boyfriend's PC.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if there
  are any cross platform font makers here or others who may be able to shed some light
  on this subject.\r\n\r\nI began this font using a template to create a new Unicode,
  Regular style font. I then pruned many of the characters slots that are outside
  the Windows 256-character ANSI set. I've now created, so far, only the cap A through
  M in their appropriate places.\r\n\r\nI've specified Unicode Version 1. Mac Roman
  is included as a Platform. I've checked the Mappings and all 13 characters created
  thus far are mapped correctly to both the Win Unicode and Mac Roman platforms.\r\n\r\nI'll
  likely end up going the conversion or Opentype route in the end, but would sure
  like to find out what's up here.\r\n"

  body: "Most likely that it is a cmap issue. The Win TTF is probably Symbol encoded
    which does not get recognised on the Mac. The Mac cmap needs proper index encoding
    (0-255).\r\n\r\nOnly then will a Symbol font work properly on the Mac.\r\n\r\nBruno

  body: "Thank you for responding, Bruno. However, it isn't encoded as a Symbol font.
    I had it as Mac Roman and \"Microsoft Unicode BMP only\". I just took a look at
    Arial and it is encoded as above but also adds \"Unicode 2.0 and onwards semantics,
    BMP only\".\r\n\r\nI'll try adding that third encoding and see if it works in
    Mac OS X."
